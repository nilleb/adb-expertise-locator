INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports three economic cooperation programs in \nSoutheast  Asia  covering  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013\nIndonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), and the Indonesia\u2013\nMalaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT).1 This technical assistance (TA) project aims to \npromote links and improve coordination among these subregional programs and between them \nand the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This is important because ASEAN \nhas launched wide-ranging regional economic integration initiatives under the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity (AEC) that have important ramifications for the medium- to long-term strategic goals \nof the three programs. Furthermore, the subregional programs can play an important role by \ntesting new ideas and approaches to support ASEAN\u201fs efforts to realize the AEC by 2015. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Impediments to Subregional Programs Acting as ASEAN Economic Community \nBuilding Blocks \n \n2.  By 2015, it is envisaged that the AEC will be a single market and production base, with a \nfree flow of goods, services, investment, skilled labor, and capital. This goal was translated into \nan AEC blueprint in 2007 with clear targets and timelines to expedite economic integration.3  In \nthe light of the emerging challenges facing the region, there is a sense of urgency among policy \nmakers in ASEAN countries to expedite regional integration to meet this tight deadline.  \n \n3.  ASEAN\u201fs  \u201ctop-down\u201d  process  is  struggling  to  meet  AEC  targets  and  timelines. \nConsequently, there is a need to take a new approach to expedite regional integration. In this \nregard, the \u201cbottom-up\u201d and market-driven process of the GMS, BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT can \nplay an important role. However, in order to do so, these subregional programs have to address \na number of impediments that stand in the way of their serving effectively as AEC building \nblocks.  \n \n4.  The 2007 midterm review of the GMS Strategic Framework (2002\u20132012)4 found that \ngood  progress  had  been  made  in  increasing  physical  connectivity  (especially  transport \nconnectivity and power generation). However, less progress had been made in carrying out \nmeasures to enhance economic competitiveness. The 2008 Independent Evaluation Department \n(IED)  Regional  Cooperation  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  report  on  the  GMS  Program \nsuggested that there is now a need to ensure physical and other forms of regional economic \nintegration are complementary.5 \n \n5.  The 2008 midterm review of the BIMP-EAGA Roadmap to Development (2006\u20132010)6 \nfound that project planning and implementation mechanisms were not in place and that the \nexisting organizational structures within BIMP-EAGA were suited more for consultations than for \n                                                \n1 The member countries of the GMS are Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (Yunnan Province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region), the Lao People\u201fs Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.   \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u201fs website on 15 July 2010. \n3  ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint, ASEAN Secretariat, January 2008. \n4  ADB. 2007. Midterm Review of the GMS Strategic Framework (2002\u20132012). Manila. \n5  These constraints will be addressed in the new GMS Strategic Framework (2012\u20132022), which is being prepared. \n6  BIMP-EAGA.2008.Midterm Review of the BIMP-EAGA Roadmap to Development(2006\u20132010).Manila.(Consultant\u201fs \nreport). \n ", "2   \nproject  implementation.  The  review  recommended  an  assessment  of  existing  institutional \nmechanisms to strengthen project planning and implementation processes. \n \n6.  As with BIMP-EAGA, the midterm review of the IMT-GT Roadmap for Development \n(2006\u20132010) found a lack of progress in the implementation of its strategic road map because of \na lack of institutional capacity. A business process review conducted as a parallel activity to the \nmidterm review recommended a reorganization of the IMT-GT\u201fs institutional structure to increase \nthe focus on project planning, formulation and implementation.   \n \n7.  The lack of interface between ASEAN and these three subregional programs means \nthere is a risk of an overlap or duplication of activities. For example, the Initiative for ASEAN \nIntegration, which is the main ASEAN mechanism for narrowing the development gap, suffers \nfrom weak inter-agency coordination and monitoring mechanisms, resulting in duplication of \ncapacity building programs and activities with those of BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. 7 The Initiative \nfor ASEAN Integration has been found to be an ineffective coordinating mechanism between \nASEAN and the three subregional programs.  \n \nB.  Impediments to Coordination among the Subregional Programs \n \n8.  One of the main reasons for the lack of efforts to coordinate and promote links among the \nsubregional programs is that they are considered to be very different from each other, limiting \nthe benefits from developing links among them. For instance, the GMS program covers its \nmember countries in their entirety (except for the PRC), while BIMP-EAGA (except for Brunei \nDarussalam) and IMT-GT involve only some provinces and parts of the participating countries. \nHowever, although the GMS program is national in scope, many GMS initiatives, especially \nthose on economic corridor development, are increasingly focused on specific areas of countries, \nrequiring substantial involvement by local authorities. 8 \n \n9.  BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT increasingly recognize that many of their initiatives cannot be \ncarried out without the support of the central government. The national\u2013local divide between the \nGMS and BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT (anchored in national development program priorities) is \ntherefore converging as all three subregional programs have had to address the national\u2013local \nissue in implementing their respective initiatives. \n \n10.  While  the  GMS  has  been  involved  in  project  development  and  sector  strategy \ndevelopment for many years, project momentum has only recently begun in BIMP-EAGA and \nIMT-GT.  This has made coordination among the subregional programs difficult. \n \nC.  Strategic Prioritization of Supporting Connectivity \n \n11.  ASEAN countries realize that to achieve the AEC goals by 2015, regional connectivity \nneeds to be enhanced.   The Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC), which was launched \nat the ASEAN Summit in October 2010, is seen as a means to enhance regional connectivity \nand  buttress  the  AEC  Blueprint. 9 The  MPAC  featured  the  three  subregional  programs \nprominently  as  \u201cbuilding  blocks\u201d  to  enhance  regional  connectivity  and  reflected  a  growing \n                                                \n7  ASEAN Secretariat.2005.Report on the Midterm Review of the Initiative for ASEAN Integration Work Plan.Jakarta. \n8 A governors\u201f forum was established in 2008 under the auspices of the GMS Economic Corridors Forum to \nstrengthen cooperation between central and local authorities, and among provincial authorities along the GMS \neconomic corridors.  BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT also have their own governors\u201f forums.   \n9  ASEAN Secretariat.2010.Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity.Jakarta. \n ", "  3 \nconvergence  between  ASEAN\u201fs  \u201ctop-down\u201d  and  the  subregional  programs\u201f  \u201cbottom-up\u201d \napproaches to regional cooperation and integration.10 \n \n12.  ADB's  many  years  of  experience  in  project  formulation,  appraisal,  monitoring  and \nimplementation, especially in the GMS Program, would be valuable to ASEAN, especially in the \nimplementation phase of the MPAC. This value of the GMS as an AEC building block has been \nenhanced  with  the  recent  endorsement  of  the  \u201cprogram  of  actions\u201d  in  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation  (TTF).11 Furthermore,  in  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT  there  is  now  greater  project \nmomentum  with  5-year  implementation  blueprints  being  prepared  in  2011  to  develop  a \nsustainable pipeline of infrastructure projects that will strengthen subregional connectivity. Until \nrecently, the lack of infrastructure strategies and connectivity project momentum impeded BIMP-\nEAGA and IMT-GT from being effective building blocks for the AEC.12  \n \n13.  ADB\u201fs  successful  experience  in  enhancing  connectivity  in  the  GMS,  the  increasing \nprioritization of connectivity projects in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, and the prominence accorded \nto subregional programs in the MPAC all provide an opportunity for prioritizing the short-term \ndevelopment  of  connectivity-related  infrastructure  projects  with  high  impact.  To  sustain \nmomentum over the medium term, a 3-year rolling pipeline of projects and technical assistance \nwill need to be developed.  Over the longer term, institutional strengthening will be needed  to \nexpand sustained project pipelines. In this regard, ADB could intensify its technical support to \nthe ASEAN Secretariat in building the institutional capacity needed to implement connectivity \nprojects and programs.13   \n \n14.  The three subregional programs are at an important stage. The new GMS Strategic \nFramework (2012\u20132022) is currently being formulated. BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT are about to \nbegin formulating their implementation blueprints. For all three programs, enhancing connectivity \nwill clearly be a core priority.  \n \nD.  Strengthening Institutional Arrangements and Mechanisms \n \n15.  The three subregional programs have similar basic organizational structures to that of \nASEAN. These consist of a leaders\u201f summit, a ministerial meeting, a senior officials\u201f meeting, \nworking groups (\u201cclusters\u201d in BIMP-EAGA), a subregional secretariat, and a national secretariat \nin each participating country.14 ADB manages the GMS secretariat from its headquarters in \nManila. The BIMP-EAGA secretariat is the BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center in Kota Kinabalu, \nMalaysia, while the IMT-GT secretariat is the Center for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation in \nPutrajaya,  Malaysia 15 \u2013  both  of  these  secretariats  face  significant  challenges  in  project \ndevelopment and implementation and in resource mobilization. 16 \n                                                \n10 ADB assisted the ASEAN Secretariat to prepare the MPAC. It contributed a chapter on resource mobilization and \ninputs on the role of GMS, BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT in transport connectivity and transport and trade facilitation. \n11 Joint Ministerial Statement at the 16th GMS Ministerial Meeting, 20 August 2010. \n12 Joint Statement at the 14th BIMP-EAGA Ministers Meeting, 8 August 2009 and Report of the IMT-GT 17th \nMinisterial Meeting, 5 August 2010.  \n13 A new ADB-ASEC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Administrative Arrangements is currently being \nprepared. The new MOU will be more focused on building institutional capacity to support connectivity projects \n(especially in transport, energy and TTF) and on supporting ASEC in the implementation of the Master Plan on \nASEAN Connectivity. The existing ADB-ASEC MOU will end in December 2010.   \n14 BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT summit meetings are held annually on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit. GMS summit \nmeetings are held every 3 years.  \n15 ADB  has  been  providing  technical  support  to  BIMP-EAGA  since  its  inception  in  1994  and  is  its  regional \ndevelopment advisor. ADB's involvement in IMT-GT has increased in recent years and ADB was endorsed by its \nleaders as a development partner in January 2007 \n16 The  protracted  legalization process of  the  BIMP-EAGA  Facilitation  Center  will  also  impede  its  role  as  the \nsubregion\u201fs central secretariat.  \n ", "4   \n \n16.  While  ASEAN  cooperation  is  led  by  foreign  and  economic  ministries,  the  three \nsubregional  programs  fall  under  the  jurisdictions  of  many  different  ministries  and  local \ngovernments.  This  has  created  many  institutional  processes  and  institutional  arrangements \ndespite the fact that many of the participating countries are almost the same. There is a need to \nstreamline and strengthen institutional mechanisms among the national government agencies to \nenable effective coordination between the three programs and ASEAN.  Within countries, there \nis a need to strengthen the institutional mechanisms between the central government agencies \nand local authorities. \n \n17.  In the light of the recent launch of the MPAC and the urgency of delivering the AEC \ntargets by 2015, improving institutional coordination between and within countries will be crucial \nfor investment programming, project development, and implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n18.  The expected impact of the TA will be better coordination among the GMS, BIMP-EAGA \nand IMT-GT subregional programs and with ASEAN. The expected outcome will be an action \nplan agreed by the ASEAN secretariat, the three subregional secretariats, and government \nstakeholders to implement measures to promote links, improve coordination, and strengthen \ninstitutional capacity to implement the AEC Blueprint and the MPAC. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n19.  A study will examine the links and coordination among the GMS, BIMP-EAGA and IMT-\nGT subregional programs and between the three subregional programs and ASEAN. This will be \nthe  first  study  of  the  strategic  frameworks  and  blueprints  and  connectivity-related  sector \nstrategies of the three subregional programs with the AEC Blueprint and the MPAC. It will focus \non areas related to physical and institutional connectivity.17 \n \n20.  The TA will have two main outputs:  \n \n(i)  It will examine links and strategic coordination issues among the GMS, BIMP-EAGA \nand IMT-GT and between the three subregional programs and ASEAN. This will \ninvolve the mapping of subregional strategic frameworks and blueprints vis \u00e0 vis the \nAEC Blueprint and the MPAC. Through a matrix summary, this mapping will identify \nareas in which the three subregional programs can help to deliver the targets and \ngoals in the AEC Blueprint and the MPAC. As part of this strategic mapping exercise, \nphysical  and  other  aspects  of  regional  connectivity  will  also  be  identified  for \ninvestment programming and project prioritization. \n(ii) It  will  analyze  the  institutional  arrangements  and  mechanisms  of  the  three \nsubregional programs and ASEAN. It will examine possible ways of streamlining and \nstrengthening institutional coordination between the ASEAN secretariat and the three \nsubregional secretariats and among national agencies so they can cooperate in \nimplementing  regional  connectivity  initiatives,  including  measures  to  support  the \ninstitutional capacity needed to implement the AEC Blueprint and MPAC. Measures \n                                                \n17The physical connectivity component of the MPAC includes infrastructure transport and energy sectors. The \ninstitutional connectivity component of the MPAC covers areas such as TTF. \n ", "  5 \nto strengthen institutional coordination among central government agencies and local \nauthorities in particular countries will also be examined.  \n \n21.  National  consultation  meetings  will  be  conducted  by  the  TA  consultants  in  ASEAN \nmember  countries  to  discuss  the  key  issues  and  impediments  to  improving  institutional \ncoordination. It is also proposed that a regional workshop be convened to present the TA \noutputs, especially their recommendations on short- and medium-term measures to promote \nlinks  and  strengthen  coordination,  and  measures  to  strengthen  institutional  capacity.  The \nregional workshop will include officers from the ASEAN secretariat, the GMS secretariat, the \nBIMP-EAGA  Facilitation  Center,  the  Center  for  IMT-GT  Subregional  Cooperation,  and \nrepresentatives from the national secretariats of ASEAN countries. The regional workshop will \nalso discuss a preliminary draft action plan to implement recommended actions, including project \nprioritization (based on selected pilot areas that support the implementation of the MPAC).   \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n22.  The TA, estimated to cost $400,000, will be financed on a grant basis by the Government \nof Australia, and administered by ADB.  The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nADB will ensure that the Australian Agency for International Development funding of the TA is \nmade clear in public communications, meetings, workshops and other events funded by the \nproject, and in other appropriate situations.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  ADB will be the executing agency responsible for administering and implementing the TA. \nADB  Southeast  Asia  Department\u201fs  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Group  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the TA and will coordinate closely with ADB \nSoutheast Asia Department resident missions and sector divisions, ASEAN secretariat, the GMS \nsecretariat, the BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center, the Center for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation, \nand government counterparts in the conduct of TA activities. The outline terms of reference of \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will be implemented over a period of 10 months, from \nFebruary 2011 to November 2011. \n \n24.  The TA will require a total of 10 person-months of international consulting services and \n10 person-months of national consulting services. Individual consultants will be engaged due to \nthe diversity of tasks and specialized expertise needed to implement this TA successfully. The \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  Disbursement under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u201fs Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).     \n \nIV.
