INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during ADB\u2019s 2014 country \nprogramming  mission  to  enhance  the  ability  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  (NDRC)  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  eco-compensation  programs  and  the \nperformance of local administrations involved in them.1 The TA was included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for the PRC for 2015\u20132017.2 ADB missions to the PRC reached an \nunderstanding with the NDRC and other stakeholders on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements, as well as the terms \nof reference for TA consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Improving the effectiveness of eco-compensation schemes in key designated ecological \nfunction  zones  became  a  government  priority  in  2013.3 The  PRC  has  made  substantial \ninvestments  in  these  zones  to  improve  ecosystem  services  using  eco-compensation \nmechanisms. 4 Overall government funding for eco-compensation in the PRC increased from \nCNY6.0 billion in 2008 to CNY48.3 billion in 2013. \n \n3.  The first issue is that despite its large investments, made through transfer payments to \nlocal governments, the government has not put a monitoring system in place to assess the \nextent to which degraded ecosystems have been restored. The main reason is a lack of tools \nand approaches to conduct systematic monitoring and assessment.  \n \n4.  The second issue is lack of incentives for local governments to make the effective \nimplementation of these eco-compensation programs a high priority. Despite the government\u2019s \ndecision in 2013 to no longer use economic development indicators in its evaluation of the \nperformance of local administrations in the key ecological function zones, both the national and \nlocal governments have found it difficult to switch to an evaluation model that also includes \nenvironmental health indicators. One reason for this is lack of pre-existing guidelines or policies \nin the PRC.  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2015. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2015\u20122017. Manila. \n3  Eco-compensation is a package of different mechanisms\uf0beincluding monetary subsidies, project support, favorable \npolicies, and other measures\uf0bethat governments at all levels of the PRC\u2019s administration use to compensate those \nwho invest money or suffer economic losses to protect ecosystems by transferring resources from those who \nbenefit  from  or  damage  them.  Ecological  functional  zones  are  zones  specifically  designated  for  ecological \nprotection. One of the spatial planning approaches taken by the national government under its twelfth five-year \nplan for 2011\u20132015 was the designation of major zones that divide the nation into four categories: (i) prohibited \ndevelopment  zones  (e.g.,  natural  and  cultural  heritage  protection  zones);  (ii)  restricted  development  zones \n(including  ecological  functional  zones  and  agricultural  zones);  (iii)  optimized  development  zones  (highly \nindustrialized areas); and (iv) key development zones (developing areas with large resources and environmental \ncapacity for development).  \n4  Natural systems such as forests, wetlands, and watersheds provide a wide variety of \u201cecosystem services\u201d and \ncontribute to human well-being and poverty reduction. These ecosystem services may include water supply and \npurification, flood regulation, fisheries, shoreline stabilization and more. Many of these ecosystem services are \nprovided indirectly, i.e., with no direct link between the service provider and the consumer of the service. For \nexample, this occurs due to the spatial separation between the location of services providers (often landowners or \nresource managers in the upper watershed) and the location of the users of these services (such as consumers of \npotable water and industries or agriculture using water downstream). \n ", "2   \n5.  The TA will address these two issues by helping the NDRC pilot test an innovative \napproach  using  the  ecosystem  production  function  that  makes  it  possible  to  link  the \ncharacteristics of an ecosystem to the ecosystem services it ultimately delivers.5 The TA will \nprepare tools and recommendations that will (i) further refine the concept of gross ecosystem \nproduct (GEP) and develop technical guidelines for calculating and using GEP, (ii) recommend \nan  approach  for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  eco-compensation  schemes  and  the \nperformance of the local administrations involved in them, (iii) provide training to important \nstakeholders  on  GEP  accounting  and  alternative  approaches  to  monitoring  the  delivery  of \necosystem services, and (iv) organize national and international knowledge-sharing seminars \nand workshops to disseminate the key lessons learned under the TA. \n \n6.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for the PRC for \n2011\u20132015 and will help support the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s draft PRC CPS for 2016\u2013\n2020.6 The new CPS will support more innovation in the use of eco-compensation for better \nenvironmental management. The TA builds on ADB\u2019s long-term cooperation with the PRC on \nthe  eco-compensation  agenda.  In  addition  to  supporting  related  publications  and  regional \nknowledge-sharing events, ADB has provided TA to help develop the national and provincial \npolicy and legislative framework for eco-compensation and was instrumental in facilitating the \nnecessary policy and legal reforms.7  \n \n7.  ADB has invested in the pilot operationalization of some eco-compensation concepts \nthrough  such  projects  as  the  Guiyang  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  (Sector) \nProject,  the  Jiangsu  Yancheng  Wetlands  Protection  Project,  and  the  Anhui  Chao  Lake \nEnvironmental Rehabilitation Project.8 In July 2014, the ADB\u2013NDRC joint knowledge hub on \ngreen growth and eco-compensation was launched in Beijing. The TA will build on these ADB \nactivities and explore new innovations and the practical aspects of eco-compensation.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n8.  The impacts will be (i) the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system to \nassess  the  improvement  of  the  targeted  ecosystem  services,  and  (ii)  improvement  in  the \nenvironment in the key ecological function zones.9 The outcome will be an enhancement of the \nNDRC\u2019s capacity for evaluating the impact of eco-compensation programs in the PRC\u2019s key \necological function zones and assessing the overall performance of the local administrations.  \n \n                                                \n5  The current limited literature defines gross ecosystem product (GEP) as total values of ecosystem services for \nhuman welfare and sustainable development. GEP mainly refers to the total value of direct and indirect use values \nof ecosystem services. \n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will deliver three outputs: (i) the development of an accounting methodology and \napproach for GEP;  (ii) preparation  of  recommendations for  evaluating  the  effectiveness of \ntargeted eco-compensation schemes and the performance of the local level administrations \ninvolved; and (iii) national and provincial staff involved in GEP accounting trained and lessons \nlearned shared.  \n \n10.  Output  1:  Gross  ecosystem  product  accounting  methodology  and  approach \ndeveloped. Through a literature review, detailed discussions between technical experts and \npolicy makers, and the implementation of pilot projects in three provinces, the TA will develop \ntechnical guidelines for GEP accounting. The proposed pilot study provinces are Guizhou, \nQinghai, and Yunnan. The TA activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  TA  consultants  will  prepare  a  methodology  and  approach  paper  for  GEP \naccounting. \n(ii)  NDRC and TA consultants will organize workshops and seminars for experts and \nkey sector agencies to discuss the draft GEP methodology and approach paper. \n(iii)  TA consultants will implement pilot studies for GEP accounting in the targeted \nprovinces.10 The studies will involve several aspects: \n(a)  TA consultants will conduct detailed stakeholder consultation and select \nfinal targeted ecosystem services that possess explicit social value, and \nare derived from a measurable ecological function unit (e.g., a river basin).  \n(b)  TA  consultants  will  quantify  targeted  ecosystem  services  and  the \nmanagement options for reducing service shortfalls. This could be done \nusing biophysical models and ecological production functions. \n(c)  TA consultant will prepare detailed technical reports on the case studies \nthat demonstrate the calculation of GEP in the target study areas over a \n6-month period. \n(iv)  NDRC and TA consultants will organize national and local level seminars and \nworkshops to discuss the findings of the pilot studies. \n(v)  TA consultants will develop draft technical guidelines for GEP accounting based \non the results of the pilot studies and stakeholder consultation. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Recommendations  for  evaluating  effectiveness  of  targeted  eco-\ncompensation schemes and performance of local level administration prepared. The TA \nactivities to deliver output 2 will include the following:  \n \n(i)  TA consultants will prepare a preliminary draft report with recommendations to \nthe government for evaluating the effectiveness of eco-compensation schemes \nbased on GEP accounting, results of the output 1 pilot studies, and other criteria. \n(ii)  TA consultants will organize national and local seminars to discuss the draft \ntechnical guidelines for the evaluation of eco-compensation effectiveness and the \nperformance of those local administrations involved. \n(iii)  Based  on  lessons  learned  abroad  and  from  TA  development  of  the  GEP \naccounting  approaches,  TA  consultants  will  revise  the  report  and \nrecommendations for the NDRC on the approach and criteria to be used for \nevaluating local administration performance. \n                                                \n10 ADB expects that the TA will support case studies at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels in these \nprovinces. \n ", "4   \n12.  Output  3:  Key  stakeholders  related  to  gross  ecosystem  product  accounting \ntrained and lessons learned from national pilot projects and international experience \nshared.  The training for key stakeholders and the sharing of lessons learned under the TA will \ninclude the following activities: \n \n(i)  The NDRC and other relevant agencies will undertake foreign study tours to give \nthem an understanding of how ecological improvement indicators similar to GEP \ncan be used to assess the performance of participating local administrations. \nAlong with other information, the study tours will provide (a) practical examples of \nthe  monitoring  of  returns  from  investments  in  the  restoration  of  ecosystem \nfunctions and services; and (b) options for evaluating the performance of local \nadministration in schemes other than the simple use of economic development \nindicators.11 \n(ii)  TA consultants will prepare a knowledge product on the key TA project findings \nthat will focus on how to use GEP as a tool to assess the effectiveness of eco-\ncompensation programs. \n(iii)  NDRC  and  TA  consultants  will  organize  an  international  knowledge-sharing \nseminar on evaluating the impacts of payments for ecosystem services and eco-\ncompensation programs to share lessons learned from the GEP pilot projects \nand findings of the TA. \n \n13.  The  GEP  is  a  new  concept,  and  its  use  to  monitor  eco-compensation  program \neffectiveness poses some risks. First, the technical details of the GEP approach will require \nfurther discussion between technical experts, academics, and key policy makers and fine-tuning \nduring the early stages of the inception phase of the TA implementation before it can be applied \nfor TA pilot project implementation. Published literature on GEP is limited.12 In addition, the \ncurrent literature also combines agricultural production and ecosystem services in the GEP \naccounting although these are not necessarily always compatible uses of land. The differences \nin spatial planning and approaches and practices between sectors and ministries in the PRC \ncould also compromise the actual proper functioning of the designated ecological function zones. \nEven though this makes close interministerial coordination crucial, a risk exists that some sector \nagencies may be unable to reach the strategic consensus required for the concept to work.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, necessary data, office space, local \ntransportation to the project sites, pilot testing, workshop costs, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                \n11  The two study tours currently planned include visits to Switzerland (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature); \nthe United Kingdom (the United Nations Environment Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Centre); Kenya \n(the United Nations Environment Programme); Canada (the Convention on Biological Diversity) and the United \nStates (the World Bank). Other planned activities will raise participants\u2019 understanding of the Water Quality Trading \nProgram in New York and wetland banking initiatives in the United States. \n12 Z. Y.

The TA will be implemented from 1 February 2016 to 31 July 2017. The Department of \nWestern Region Development of NDRC will be the executing agency. A TA management office \nwill  be  established  in  NDRC  and  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  operations,  with  ADB \nconsultants  reviewing  their  outputs  and  coordinating  with  the  consultants  and  related \ngovernment agencies for the preparation of the national and provincial workshops. A project \nmanagement office will be set up within NDRC and be responsible for day-to-day TA operations, \nincluding  overseeing  the  TA  consultants\u2019  work  plans.  An  advance  payment  facility  will  be \nestablished for TA implementation and an intersector coordination body will be set up by NDRC \nto provide guidance and input during the TA implementation. \n \n16.  The TA will require 3 person-months of international and 37 person-months of national \nconsulting services. The project will require one international specialist (deputy team leader and \necosystem management specialist) and seven national specialists (team leader and ecosystem \nmanagement  specialist,  eco-compensation  policy  specialist,  environmental  economist, \nenvironmental  monitoring  specialist,  statistics  specialist,  social  development  specialist,  and \nremote sensing and geographic information system specialist). The outline terms of reference \nfor  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n17.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA projects. ADB will carry out monitoring and review missions at the inception, \ninterim, and final phases of the project. During these missions, ADB, the executing agency, the \nconsultants, and stakeholders will review the technical progress of the project and provide \nfeedback to improve the TA. Progress will be measured against the targets and indicators in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and \nreported in TA progress reports. TA progress reports will be reviewed by ADB and local experts \nto provide additional feedback and guidance. The best practices and lessons learned will be \ndisseminated through project reports, a training program, TA workshops, and media releases. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Developing Gross Ecosystem Product \nAccounting for Eco-Compensation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \n1.
