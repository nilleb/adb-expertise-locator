INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Country Programming Mission of the Asian  Development Bank (ADB) in \nMarch 2004, His Majesty's Government of Nepal reconfirmed its request to ADB for technical \nassistance (TA) to continue its support of power sector restructuring in Nepal. The TA is \nincluded in the 2004 ADB country assistance program.1 The TA Fact-Finding  Mission  was \nfielded in Nepal from 27 October to 5 November 2004 and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, costs, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and \noutline terms of reference for the TA.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The power sector in Nepal is dominated by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), a \nvertically integrated, Government-owned and -controlled utility, with  several independent power \nproducers, some of  whom  also  distribute  power  in  areas  adjacent  to  their  plants.3 NEA\u2019s \ninstalled and grid-connected capacity amounts to 402 megawatts (MW) of hydroelectric and 57 \nMW of peaking thermal power. NEA\u2019s operational performance has not been up to international \nstandards: system losses are as high as 23%, power quality is substandard, and its financial \nposition has deteriorated over the past few years. Furthermore, Government domination of the \nboard of directors does not allow the NEA board and senior management to efficiently exercise \nthe authority and responsibility needed to run an industrial enterprise.  \n \n3.  Nepal\u2019s electrification ratio is still very low. Only about one third of the population has \naccess to electricity, and in rural areas, where most people live, access is much lower. Despite \nthe great potential for hydropower, power sector development has been constrained by the \nsmall size of Nepal\u2019s economy and of the modern industrial and commercial sectors. However, \nthe demand for power has increased steadily, with an annual average growth rate of 8.5% over \nthe past decade, and is forecast to grow at 7.5% annually until 2020. The Tenth Plan [Fiscal \nYear (FY) 2003\u20132007] sets out the Government\u2019s goal of providing electricity to 55% of the \npopulation by FY2007. This requires continuing rapid expansion of electrification in the country.   \n \n4.  Being a low-income country with a low electrification ratio and limited financial resources \nin the public sector, Nepal needs to attract more domestic and foreign investment in hydropower \ndevelopment to meet demand. Empirical evidence shows that power sector reform can reduce \nthe cost of delivered electricity by transforming the constituent businesses into commercial \nenterprises that will seek to cut waste  and improve the efficiency of their operations, under \npressure either from the market or from the regulator.  \n \n5.  The Government has recognized that NEA must be unbundled to improve efficiency \nthrough  competition  and  commercialization  and  that  an  independent  regulator  must  be \nestablished to show prospective investors  an effectively regulated system operated with good \ngovernance.    Given  the  massive  challenges  Nepal  faces\u2014a  small  market,  unstable \nsociopolitical situation, capital-intensive hydropower resources, and the urgent need to expand \nrural electrification\u2014a phased approach toward power sector reform is considered suitable to \ncreate a sustainable and efficient power industry. The Government has given unambiguous \ncommitments  to  unbundle  NEA  and  create  an  effective,  independent  regulator  and  an \nautonomous operator of the transmission and dispatch system. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 August 2004. \n3  Nine independently owned power plants are operating in the country with a total capacity of 144 MW. \n ", "2  \n \n6.  During the workshop and the tripartite meeting among the Government,  ADB and the \nconsultants for an ADB TA4 held in November 2004, consensus was reached on a road map for \nreforms intended to bring about a new power industry managed according to the principles of a \ncommercial enterprise under a strong regulator. The Government has agreed, in principle, to the \nroad map set out under this TA. This reform foresees the unbundling of NEA into four distinct \nentities of generation, transmission, distribution, and engineering, to be established under the \nCompanies Act, with 100% of the shares initially owned by the Government. The Government \nand NEA have endorsed the recommended  reform of the NEA board of directors  as one \nmeasure to improve management effectiveness and transparency, and have confirmed that they \nwill begin to  draft the operating rules and other documents that will be the foundation for a new \nboard  by the end of 2004. The draft documents will need to be reviewed by experts to ensure \nthat they meet the required standards for utility governance. \n \n7.   Although the Government has made a series of clear policy commitments to power \nsector reform, the present legal and regulatory framework does not enable such measures to be \nundertaken. Legislation to enable the unbundling of NEA and the setting up of an independent \nregulator is expected to be drafted by February 2005,5 and the Government has confirmed that  \nthese legislative initiatives will  be enacted  by May 2005. \n \n8.   The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided  TA to \nthe Government to set up the Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), an independent \nregulator, and will continue to assist NERC with training and tariff setting.  NERC is expected to \nbecome operational in the fourth quarter of 2005, which will allow  the Government and NEA \nenough  time  to  undertake  the  detailed  preparatory  work  necessary  for  divestiture  and \ncorporatization.   \n \n9.  The Government has confirmed that priority will be given to creating a transmission \ncompany, provisionally called the Nepal Power Grid Corporation (NEPGRID), initially operated \nas a single buyer, to  increase financial transparency and encourage all market players and \npotential investors. This is expected to help realize the country\u2019s abundant hydropower potential \nand enable export of power to neighboring countries. The Government requested ADB to \nprovide TA in establishing NEPGRID, which will consist of NEA\u2019s existing transmission and \nsystem operation (dispatch) business unit and of new departments responsible for settlements \nand investment planning. The Government has agreed to establish a task force with qualified \nand experienced staff and facilities before fielding the consultants for the TA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will help the Government launch the reform process by establishing NEPGRID. \nThe scope of the TA will include (i) preparatory steps for establishing NEPGRID, (ii) preparation \nof  human  resources  strategy,  (iii)  assessment  of  additional  technology  and  software \nrequirements, (iv) upgrading of NEA grid documents to a grid code suitable for use by all market \nparticipants and preparation of the power transmission policy, and (v) preparation of detailed \nscope of work for financial structure of NEPGRID. The TA will define the new company\u2019s distinct \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Power Sector Reforms in Nepal. Manila (TA 3552-\nNEP). \n5  USAID has been helping the Government draft the new act to establish NERC and the amendments to relevant \nacts needed to enable the desired reforms.  ", "  3\nroles, functions, and relations with other sector entities, and provide technical experts to review \nthe documents to be prepared by the Government for NEA board reform to improve corporate \ngovernance.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  By the time the consultants are fielded, the Government will establish a task force, \nheaded by the person designated to become the head of the new NEPGRID. The task force will \nbe composed of managers drawn from NEA\u2019s transmission system operation unit and officials \nfrom the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) and Department of Electricity Development. The \nconsultants'  team  will  work  jointly  with  this  task  force,  continuously  involving  task  force \npersonnel in all the work associated with the TA. The consultants may propose joint working \ngroups, if necessary, to address specific elements of the TA, such as grid code, technology \nassessment, etc. All of the deliverables in this TA will emerge as being fully \u201cowned\u201d by the task \nforce.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $510,000 equivalent, consisting of $306,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $204,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $400,000 \nequivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $94,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of the local currency cost equivalent to $110,000 in kind \nfor office space and facilities, counterpart staff, local transportation,  and administrative and \nsecretarial support. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MOWR, which has the overall responsibility for restructuring the power industry, will be \nthe Executing Agency for the TA. A TA steering committee to be chaired by the secretary, \nMOWR, will be appointed  before the consultants are fielded, to guide and supervise the TA. \nThe steering committee will comprise senior Government officials from the Ministry of Finance, \nNational Planning Commission, MOWR, and Department of Electricity Development, as well as \nsenior staff of NEA and representatives from the private sector. MOWR will provide the team of \nconsultants office accommodation and facilities and transport within Nepal, free of charge, and \nmake arrangements to assist the consultants in data gathering, preliminary analysis, and report \nwriting. The entire work, including report writing, will be done in Nepal to maximize transfer of \nknowledge. The consulting firm will make  its own arrangements for personal computers for \nproducing reports. A study tour will be organized for the steering committee members to visit \ntransmission companies in two neighboring countries that have unbundled a vertically integrated \nutility.  \n \n14.  The TA will require about 8 person-months of input from an international consulting firm \nwith expertise in establishing new grid-operating companies in developing countries, and in \nmanaging power utility corporations. The international consultants will be supported by domestic \nconsultants (22 person-months) with expertise in transmission system structure and operations, \nasset valuation, human resources and utility management. An international consulting firm will \nbe selected in accordance with biodata technical proposals, following the Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants. ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \n ", "4  \nmethod will be applied to select the firm.  The outline terms of reference for the TA are in \nAppendix 3.   \n \n15.  Consulting services are expected to begin in March 2005 and be completed within 9 \nmonths. The consultants will submit various reports simultaneously to the Government and \nADB. An inception report with initial findings and proposed action plan for conducting the study \nwill be submitted within 1 month after services start. Within 3 weeks of the receipt of the \ninception report, a tripartite meeting among the Government, ADB and the consultants will be \nconvened in Kathmandu to discuss the report. An interim report will be submitted within 5 \nmonths and a draft final report within 8 months after services start. These reports will be \nreviewed at a tripartite meeting in Kathmandu. The consultants will organize a workshop in \nKathmandu, inviting various stakeholders to discuss the draft final report. The final report will be \nsubmitted within 3 weeks after the tripartite review of the draft final report.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for the Restructuring of Nepal Electricity Authority, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n\u2022  Increased efficiency in  \u2022  Electrification ratio  \u2022  National statistics \nNepal power sector and  increased to 55% by \nincreased electrification  2007 \nratio   \n \nPurpose      Assumptions \n\u2022  Corporatization of  \u2022  Establishment of Nepal  \u2022  Memorandum of  \u2022  Continued political will  \ntransmission unit of  Power Grid Corporation  Association and  to reform power sector  \nNepal Electricity Authority  (NEPGRID) in 2006  Articles of Associations  \u2022  Establishment of the \n(NEA)  \u2022  New NEA board  of NEPGRID  independent Nepal \n\u2022  Improvement of  structure  \u2022  NEA board charter  Electricity Regulatory \ncorporate governance of       Commission (NERC) in \nNEA board  2005 \n  \u2022  Sociopolitical stability \n\u2022  Sufficient investment in \npower sector from \npublic and private \nsectors \nOutputs      Assumptions \n\u2022  Detailed plan for  \u2022  Inception report by April  \u2022  TA progress report and  \u2022  Timely enactment of \nestablishment of  2005  completion report  legislation for creation \nNEPGRID  \u2022  Interim report by July  \u2022  Back-to-office reports  of NEPGRID and NEA \n\u2022  Human resources  2005  of  ADB TA review  board reform  \nstrategy  \u2022  Draft final report by  missions  \u2022  Availability of funds for \n\u2022  List of additional  October 2005  \u2022  Outcome of tripartite  implementing reforms  \nhardware and software  meetings and  \u2022  Adequate capacity of \nrequirements    workshop  the Government  to \n\u2022  Grid code and    implement reforms  \ntransmission policy  Risk \n\u2022  Proposed financial and  \u2022  Delay in establishment \nfinancial management  and functioning of \nstructure of NEPGRID  NERC   \n\u2022  NEA\u2019s new board   \ndocuments \n \nActivities      Assumption \n\u2022  Identify preparatory work  \u2022  TA commencement date:  \u2022  TA progress report and  \u2022  Timely recruitment of \nfor establishment of  March 2005.  completion report  TA consultants and \nNEPGRID  \u2022  TA completion date:  \u2022  Back-to-office reports  implementation of TA \n\u2022  Review and prepare  November 2005.  by ADB TA review  Risk \nhuman resources    missions  \u2022  Weak management of \nstrategies  \u2022  Outcome of tripartite  TA \n\u2022  Review existing  meetings and   \nhardware and software to  workshop   \nidentify additional     \nrequirements \n \n\u2022  Review existing grid \ndocument and upgrade to \ngrid code; prepare \nnational transmission \npolicy  \n\u2022  Review status and work \nneeded  to meet financial \nContinued on next page \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nrequirements of \nNEPGRID \n\u2022  Review  draft NEA board \ndocuments \n \nInputs      Assumption \n\u2022  Consultants  \u2022  8 person-months of  \u2022  Proposals by  \u2022  Counterpart staff and \n  international consulting  consultants  budget available on \n  services and 22 person- \u2022  Contractor negotiation  time \n  months of domestic  minutes  Risk \n  consulting services  \u2022  Weak performance by \n  \u2022  ADB TA grant of  consultants \n  $400,000   \n\u2022  The Ministry of Water  \u2022  In-kind contribution of \nResources' internal  $110,000 by the \nresources  Government \n   \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The Government of Nepal has decided that within the process of unbundling the Nepal \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA),  priority  will  be  given  to  prepare  for  the  separation  of  NEA\u2019s \nTransmission and System Operation business unit into a new, independent, publicly owned \ncorporation  provisionally called the Nepal Power Grid Corporation (NEPGRID).   \n \n2.  The Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), in consultation with NEA, will draft the \ncorporate governance documents needed for NEA board reform, including (i) qualifications \nstandards and nomination process for director, (ii) stockholder communications with directors, \n(iii) director\u2019s responsibilities, (iv) director\u2019s access to management and independent advisors as \nnecessary, (v) director\u2019s compensation; (vi) orientation and ongoing training of director, (vii) \nannual performance of the board, and (viii) board operating rules and committee structure and \ndirectives. These documents need to be reviewed to bring the NEA board into conformity with \nmodern  governance  practices  for  large  corporations  and  to  eliminate  direct  Government \ninvolvement in NEA operations and management. The consultants will work closely with MOWR \nand NEA in this area.      \n \n3.  The consulting firm will appoint one of the international consultants as team leader, who  \nwill also serve as a technical expert and  be responsible for the overall management of the \nstudy. The team leader will coordinate the TA among all the Government agencies concerned, \nADB, and other development partners to ensure smooth implementation and non-duplication of \nwork, and will ultimately be responsible for all deliverables of the TA study.  The team leader will \nalso closely coordinate with the consulting teams of other relevant studies, including the ADB \nTA for Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Project.    \n \n4.  The consulting firm will provide experts with relevant experience in establishing new \ngrid-operating companies in developing countries, human resources management, finance and \naccounting,  power  utility  corporate  management,  and  experts  with  knowledge  of  NEA\u2019s \ntransmission system and operation.  \n \n5.
