INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), to undertake the Study on the \nCarrying Capacity1 of Water Resources. The TA2 was included in the PRC country strategy and \nprogram update for 2002. An ADB fact-finding mission visited the PRC from 19 to 30 August \n2002 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, cost and \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements of the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The total available water resource (surface plus groundwater) in the PRC is estimated at \nabout 2,800 billion cubic meters (m3) per annum including recharge from groundwater of 830 \nbillion m3, or per capita availability in 1992 of 2,400 m\u00b3/person.3 The water availability has \ndecreased to 2,220 m3/person in 1997 and is expected to decrease further to 1,700 m3/person \nby 2030, when the population is forecast to peak at 1.6 billion. Continuing population growth and \nrapid economic growth of about 7\u20138% per annum has increased water use per capita and \ncompetition among potential water uses, while aquifers are becoming depleted, water pollution \nis rising, and the ecosystem and environment are being degraded. Total water usage has \nincreased from 530 billion m\u00b3 in 1993 to currently 552 billion m3. While agriculture and other \nrural uses dominate water use, accounting for 69%, industry (21%) and urban domestic (10%) \nuses have been increasing rapidly.  The PRC\u2019s water resources are unevenly distributed in time \nand space, with rainfall concentrated in April to September and less water in the north than in \nthe south. For example, per capita water availability in the Haihe River Basin in the north is only \n355 m3/person.  However, 1,000 m3/person is the internationally accepted limit, below which \nwater is defined as scarce. \n \n3.  Beside the need to meet increasing demands for domestic and industrial use, adequate \nflows need to be maintained in rivers to protect the environment and ecosystem. The present \nPRC guideline is that water use in a river basin should not exceed 40% of the average annual \nrunoff to avoid serious ecological and environmental damage. In water-scarce regions and \nbasins,  water  use  has  exceeded  95%  of  the  average  annual  runoff,  causing  serious \nenvironmental  and  ecological  problems,  which  are  already  evident  in  land  subsidence, \ndisappearance of wetlands, drying of riverbeds and estuaries, serious sedimentation in river \nmouths, sea water intrusion, depletion and pollution of groundwater, water quality degradation, \nand pollutant loads that are far beyond the self-purification capacity of rivers. This situation \nmakes sustained economic growth impossible, and adversely affects the quality of life of the \nlarger population, particularly the poor, who depend on these natural water regimes and who \nsuffer disproportionately from lack of access to safe water. \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s Tenth Five-year Plan (2001\u20132005) points out the need for sustainable use of \nwater  resources  based  on  river  basin  capacity,  and  balanced  socioeconomic  development \nbased on existing natural and human resources by (i) establishing a water-saving society with \nfocus on increasing water use efficiency, promoting water saving, and improving water use; (ii) \n                                                 \n1  Water resources carrying capacity is defined as \u201cthe maximum yield (exploitable amount of available surface and \ngroundwater of a certain quality) of a river basin under the condition that water allocation to subsistence and \ncommercial  functions  is  reasonable  and  feasible  from  a  technological  and  economical  viewpoint  and  the \nenvironmental function and ecological value are sufficiently sustainable.\u201d The TA will clearly define the water \nresources carrying capacity and provide the analytical and computational framework for water resources planning, \nwhich includes the methodology for estimating ecological and environmental water demands. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 28 August 2002. \n3  Ministry of Water Resources assessment, 1992. ", "2 \nenhancing unified planning and management; (iii) optimizing allocation on a whole-basin basis; \nand  (iv)  coordinating  water  use  for  industrial,  domestic,  and  ecological  purposes.  The \nGovernment  realizes  the  need  to  protect  its  ecological  environment  to  sustain  its  water \nresources  and  to  establish  an  overall  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  setting  the \nregulations and standards for integrated water resources management. \n \n5.  ADB has been increasingly involved in water resources management in the PRC and \nhas  assisted  the  Government  to  plan  water  resources  on  a  holistic  river  basin  approach, \nthoroughly integrating environmental, social, and economic considerations in regional planning \nthrough analysis of different scenarios.4 TA 1835-PRC strengthened the institutional capacity of \nthe Haihe River Water Conservancy Commission for water resources planning and resulted in a \nlist of potential development projects. The Haihe Basin was also identified as one of three \npriority river basins targeted for environmental improvement.   \n \n6.  ADB further assisted the Government to define a strategic planning process and identify \nand evaluate strategic options for addressing the main issues and constraints in the water \nsector, for effective water management. TA 2817-PRC5 identified seven priority issues relating \nto (i) mobilizing the institutional and financial means (viz. lack of unified water administration and \nmanagement; gap between policy, planning, and implementation; and inadequacy of financial \nresources); and (ii) addressing major water resources problems (viz. escalating flood damage, \nwater  scarcity,  and  inefficient  water  use;  and  increasing  water  pollution,  soil  erosion,  and \necosystem degradation. The need to strengthen present approaches in the water sector, and \nupgrade planning and management capacity over the longer term was highlighted. \n \n7.  To  clarify  the  diverse  responsibilities  for  water  management,  the  National  People\u2019s \nCongress approved the revision of the 1988 Water Law on 29 August 2002, to become effective \non 1 October 2002. New features of the revised law include (i) establishing a centralized \nauthority for administration, management, and supervision, and allocation of water, including \nwater rights and water use rights; (ii) licensing for the withdrawal of water; (iii) preparing plans \nfor  water  resources  development,  use,  protection,  and  saving  based  on  river  basins  and \nadministrative regions; (iv) introducing a zoning system for different uses of water and a system \nfor setting total sewage discharge limits; (v) introducing the river basin management concept \nand defining the legal status of river basin administration agencies (commissions); and (vi) \nintroducing a two-step water pricing mechanism. Many of these changes are consistent with \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue. ADB will assist the Government in setting out principles and procedures \nfor integrated river basin management, including watershed management in the Yellow River.6 \nAlso, taking the Yellow River as a case study, ADB is helping the Government to strengthen \nenvironmental  management,  develop  local  legislation  and  regulations  for  implementing  the \ntrans-jurisdiction provisions of the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Act, examine the \nneed  for  a  national  law  to  integrate  various  dimensions  of  river  basin  environmental \nmanagement, and disseminate the findings and recommendations for potential application in \nother river basins.7 The capacity of concerned institutions on hydrological units are also being \nstrengthened  on  participatory  approaches  toward  better  integrated  water  management  and \nwater resources demand management, under the ongoing Water Sector Development Project \nassisted by the Department For International Development (DFID). \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB.1992. TA 1835-PRC: Haihe Basin Environmental Management and Planning Study, Manila. \n5  ADB.1997. TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the Water Sector, Manila. \n6   ADB.2002. TA 3708-PRC: Strategic Planning Study of Yellow River Law, Manila. \n7  ADB.2000. TA 3588-PRC: Trans-jurisdiction Environmental Management, Manila. ", "    3 \n8.  Despite the progress made in its legal and policy framework, the PRC still needs to \ndevelop capacity to accurately estimate the amount and quality of water that is needed to \nprotect the rapidly deteriorating ecosystem and environment within and along the rivers; assess \nwater demands by various users to allow sustained economic growth; and develop appropriate \nconditions  to  allocate  water,  monitor  use,  and  resolve  conflicts  among  water  users.  Such \nplanning capacity will, in turn, allow the determination of the maximum amount of water that can \nbe sustainably used for other purposes, such as economic and domestic uses. The appropriate \nmethodology to determine the carrying capacity of rivers is thus considered as a crucial basis to \ndetermine appropriate and sustainable allocation and use of water in the river basins. In the \nPRC, however, no systematic research to determine the water resources carrying capacity has \nbeen conducted. The TA will address this crucial element, to improve the management of water \nresources in a sustainable manner in the context of trans-jurisdictional, integrated river basin \nmanagement, which is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy and its operational strategy for the \nPRC to promote integrated water resources management particularly in water deficit areas of \nthe north and west. The recent Johannesburg World Summit has also reaffirmed commitment to \nmanaging  the  natural resource  base  in  a  sustainable  and  integrated  manner  as  a central \nelement of the international agenda, and includes in its plan for implementation, among others, \nto develop integrated water resources management and water efficiency plans by 2005.8 \n \n9.  The TA will help the PRC develop such capacity on a pilot basis for the Haihe River \nBasin, which covers parts of Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces and \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The basin is representative of the conditions in the north \nand northeast PRC, and is characterized by very high demands for water. The area is one of the \nthree  major  crop-producing  basins,  but  high  economic  activity  in  the  basin  has  made  it \nincreasingly difficult to allocate water on an environmentally sustained basis. Shortages of water \nand conflicts among water users have become a major issue, constraining sustained economic \ngrowth. The basin is also characterized by the highly developed water monitoring system and \navailability  of  extensive  river  flow  data,  providing  an  optimum  platform  to  pilot  test  the \ndevelopment of carrying capacity assessment. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to develop within the PRC\u2019s water sector agencies, capacity \n(methodology, supporting tools, and human resources) to determine the quantity and quality of \nriver flows needed to maintain the ecology and environment of the basin, thereby allowing the \nriver basin agency to monitor the consumption of water against the river\u2019s carrying capacity. The \noutputs of the TA will include (i) a methodology for estimating the environmental water demand \nand water demand-supply tradeoffs, (ii) a provisional river basin plan for the Haihe River Basin, \nand (iii) enhanced knowledge and skills in planning for integrated water resources management.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will take into account the relevant findings of previous ADB-funded TAs and \nother studies and will (i) develop a methodology to define and determine the quality and quantity \nof  water  needed  to  sustain  the  basin\u2019s  environment  and  ecosystem,  including  design  of \nconsolidated  and  water  resources  and  environmental  database  based  on  Geographical \nInformation System; (ii) develop a monitoring system of the ecological health of the basin, \n                                                 \n8   World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, 26 August to 4 September 2002. ", "4 \nincluding but not limited to water quality, biodiversity, flora, and fauna; (iii) carry out a policy and \ninstitutional review to ensure effective management of consumption of river flows within its \ncarrying capacity; and (iv) demonstrate the usefulness and suitability of the methodology in the \nHaihe River Basin.  \n \n12.  Human  resources  capacity  within  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  will  be \nimproved  through  on-the-job  and  specific  training  sessions.  International  training  (for  a \nmaximum  of  10  staff)  will  also  be  carried  out  in  an  appropriate  country  (e.g.  Institute  for \nInfrastructural, Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering Delft, Netherlands). Training will be \norganized (i) at the policy level, for water resources planning, policy formulation, and decision \nmaking; and (ii) at managerial and technical levels, for staff and experts on water resources \nplanning  methodologies,  principles,  and  evaluation  of  ecological  and  environmental  water \ndemands and estimation of water resources carrying capacity. Workshops will be organized to \ndiscuss (i) the methodologies for estimating ecological and environmental water demands; (ii) \nassessment of water resources carrying capacity; (iii) water resources planning and policy \nformulation with integrated social and economic development and environmental protection; and \n(iv) the study results. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $755,000 equivalent, consisting of $350,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $405,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $250,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of \n$155,000 equivalent. Government financing will cover remuneration and per diem of counterpart \nstaff; office accommodation and equipment; workshop expenses; translation and interpretation; \nand maps, documents, and reference materials required during the course of the study. Details \nof the cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2. ADB has informed the \nGovernment  that  approval  of  the  TA  does  not  commit  ADB  to  extend  any  further  TA  for \nimplementing any recommendations of the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of International Cooperation, Science and Technology in MWR will be \nthe Executing Agency for the TA, and will coordinate activities with other stakeholders. MWR \nwill provide necessary office space and logistical support for TA implementation. A project \nofficer will be appointed within MWR to head a full-time counterpart team. The counterpart team \nwill work closely with the TA consultants and liaise with ADB. \n \n15.  A TA technical panel will be set up to coordinate and guide, as required, the work of the \nTA  consultant  and  counterpart  team.  The  panel  will  consist  of  technical  experts  from \ngovernment agencies, nongovernment organizations, universities, established experts in the \nPRC,  the  Global  Water  Partnership  China  Technical  Advisory  Committee,  and  other \nstakeholders as necessary. The technical panel in collaboration with the counterpart team will \norganize at least three 1 day workshops during TA implementation. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented by a team of international consultants in association with \ndomestic consultants. The consultants, to be engaged through a firm, will be selected by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Since the methodology and terms of ", "    5 \nreference  (TOR)  are  specific  and  clear,  consultants  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  the \nsimplified technical proposal procedure. TA implementation is expected to commence in April \n2003 and end in March 2004 over a period of 12 months. A total of 56 person-months of \nconsulting  services  will  be  required,  comprising  11  person-months  of  international  and  45 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. The international consultants will comprise (i) a water \nresources specialist/team leader; (ii) a hydrologist; and (iii) a freshwater ecologist. The domestic \nconsultants  will  comprise  (i)  a  water  resources  planner  and  institutions  specialist/(team \ncoleader); (ii) an environmental specialist; (iii) a freshwater ecologist; (iv) a water resources \nspecialist; (v) a geohydrologist; (vi) a hydrologist; (vii) an irrigated agriculture specialist; and (viii) \nan economic planner. Outline TOR for the consulting services are given in Appendix 3. The TA \nconsultants will advise on and purchase a commercially available river basin planning software \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for procurement. The software will be transferred to MWR \nat TA completion. \n \n17.  ADB will select and engage consultants based on the quality of the proposal and the \ncost  of  the  services  to  be  provided  (the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method).  The \nGovernment may recommend specific consulting firms to be included in the long list of firms, \nwhich ADB will take into consideration in preparing the short list. The short list of consulting \nfirms,  once  prepared,  will  be  sent  to  the  Government  for  comment  and  statement  of  any \nobjections before the invitation to submit technical and financial proposals is issued to the firms. \nThe Government is encouraged to meet with the invited firms to explain its expectations of the \noutcome  and  implementation  of  the  TA  and  consulting  services.  A  representative  of  the \nGovernment will be invited to participate in contract negotiations with the consultant. \n \n18.  At  the  end  of  the  first  month  of  TA  implementation,  the  consultant  will  submit  an \ninception report to the Government and ADB that will be discussed in a tripartite review meeting. \nAt the end of the fourth month, the consultant will conduct an international workshop to discuss \nthe analytical and computational framework developed under the studies and to apprise relevant \nstakeholders  of  the  TA\u2019s  objectives  and  scope.  An  interim  report  will  be  submitted  to  the \nGovernment and ADB at the end of the eighth month, the findings of which will be discussed in \nan interim stakeholder workshop and subsequently in a second tripartite review meeting. A draft \nfinal report (DFR) will be submitted to the Government and ADB on the eleventh month, and will \nbe presented by the consultant in a final workshop. A third tripartite review meeting will be held \nprior to the conclusion of the TA to discuss the DFR. The suggestions and comments generated \nduring the final workshop and the tripartite review meeting will be incorporated into the TA final \nreport, to be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of the TA implementation period. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study of the Carrying Capacity of \nWater Resources, and hereby reports such action to the Board.
