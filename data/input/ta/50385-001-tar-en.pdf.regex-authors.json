The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  improve  the \ninstitutional capacity of selected Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries \n(DMCs) to localize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 In response to DMC demand, \nthe proposed TA will add value to the programs and operations of regional departments by \nsupporting (i) the strengthening of awareness, knowledge, and skills for effective localization of \nthe SDGs in selected DMCs; (ii) testing of innovative institutional capacity interventions for \nlocalizing SDGs in selected DMCs; and (iii) enhancing dialogue, including among developing \ncountries, on good practices in SDG localization.2 \n \n2.  The proposed TA is included in the 2017 work program of the Governance Thematic \nGroup  (GovTG).3 It  builds  on  previous  knowledge  activities  of  the  GovTG,  such  as  the \nconferences conducted jointly with the Development Partners Network on Decentralisation and \nLocal  Governance  (DeLoG)  in  August  2015  and  September  2016,4 and  the  international \nconference on the Role of Managing for Development Results in Achieving the SDGs 2030 (June \n2017).5 The proposed TA also takes into account the lessons from a series of learning programs \non Multi-Stakeholder Engagement for Reform in different settings.6 The TA is aligned with recent \nADB strategy and policy papers on public sector management, institutional performance, and \ncapacity development, and factors in lessons from past and ongoing decentralization and local \ngovernance operations in countries such as Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nIndonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In September 2015, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 \n(Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development), which includes 17 \nSDGs and 169 targets, as a new reference for global development efforts. ADB supports its DMCs \nin achieving the SDGs through a customized approach with respect to sustainable development \ninvestments and enhanced financing needs, and by incorporating sustainability into its corporate \nresults framework and reporting processes and enhanced financing needs.8  \n \n                                                \n1  Localization is defined as \u201cthe process of taking into account subnational contexts in the achievement of the 2030 \nAgenda, from the setting of goals and targets to determining the means of implementation and using indicators to \nmeasure and monitor progress\u201d.

Unlike the Millennium Development Goals, which were highly centralized, the SDGs \ncapture  environmental,  economic,  political,  and  social  dimensions  of  development  more \nholistically. While the text of the SDGs does not contain an explicit call for localizing the SDGs, \nlocal governments are recognized directly or indirectly in many of the goals, notably in Goal 11 \n(Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) and Goal 16 \n(Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels). \n \n5.  Subnational governments have a critical role in implementing and achieving the SDGs, \nincluding those where localization is not explicitly mentioned, because (i) the experience of \ndeveloped countries suggests that as economic and population growth and urbanization increase \na greater share of public investments and spending will occur at the local level; (ii) addressing \nglobal resource challenges and constraints\u2014such as pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate \nchange\u2014will  require  close  involvement  of  subnational  governments;  and  (iii)  subnational \ngovernments are closer to citizens and better positioned to provide opportunities for the poor and \nmarginalized to be heard. The proposed TA will support implementation of the roadmap for \nlocalizing the SDGs developed by the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Habitat to support cities and regions \nto deliver the 2030 agenda; roadmap development included an intensive consultation process \n(footnote 1).9  \n \n6.  Many  DMCs  lack  the  institutional  capacity  to  localize  the  SDGs,  and  institutional \nstrengthening is needed with respect to: (i) multilevel governance systems defined by national \ngovernments (i.e., related to functional assignments, intergovernmental fiscal relations, and \nnational\u2013subnational development plan integration); (ii) subnational governmental processes, to \nensure that regulations, planning and budgeting processes; service delivery mechanisms; and \ninfrastructure investments are responsive to SDG goals; and (iii) transparent and participatory \nmulti-stakeholder engagement processes involving local governments and parliaments, citizens, \nand the private sector to ensure accountability on SDG target achievement, drawing on adequate \nnational and subnational monitoring systems. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: performance of institutions in DMCs for \nlocalizing Agenda 2030 commitments for sustainable development improved. The TA will have \nthe following outcome: institutional capacity of selected DMCs to localize the SDGs improved.10  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  The proposed TA will support three key outputs, which are designed to respond flexibly to \nvarious potential DMC institutional strengthening needs for localizing the SDGs (para. 6). The \nultimate support areas under the TA will be determined through consultations with regional \n                                                \n9  The consultations generated the following key messages: (i) local and regional governments are essential for \npromoting  inclusive  sustainable  development  within  their  territories  and  are  necessary  partners  in  SDG \nimplementation; (ii) effective local governance can ensure that a diversity of local stakeholders are included, which \nencourages broad-based ownership, commitment, and accountability; (iii) an integrated multilevel and multi-\nstakeholder approach is needed to promote transformative local agendas; and (iv) a strong commitment is required \nat the national level to provide adequate legal frameworks and institutional and financial capacity. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ndepartments and DMCs. The TA can support the localizing of any of the SDGs, but the highest \ndemand is expected to be for the service delivery- and infrastructure-related SDGs, as well as for \ngoals related to sustainable cities, the environment, and climate action.  \n \n9.  Output  1:  Awareness,  knowledge,  and  skills  for  effective  localization  of  the \nSustainable Development Goals in selected developing member countries strengthened. \nUnder output 1, at least three customized regional or country-specific learning programs will be \ndeveloped and conducted, focusing on the awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to localize \nthe SDGs. At least 150 local stakeholders, preferably involved in ADB projects, will participate in \nthe programs by December 2019. An existing program on Multi-Stakeholder Engagement for \nReform developed by ADB and tested through ADB staff training since 2007 will be customized \nto better respond to SDG implementation challenges. The program teaches critical skills\u2014such \nas understanding stakeholders and their underlying interests and power relations\u2014 in support of \ncollective action in complex multi-stakeholder settings. The TA will respond to a request by the \nPacific Department to implement a customized version of the Multi-Stakeholder Engagement for \nReform learning program for participants involved in the Improving Quality of Basic Education \nProject in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Innovative  institutional  capacity  interventions  for  localizing  the \nSustainable Development Goals in selected developing member countries tested. Under \noutput 2, at least two subprojects that respond to any of the various institutional strengthening \nneeds (para. 6) will be identified in close cooperation with regional departments and DMCs, and \nbe  implemented  by  March  2020.  Subprojects  that  present  challenges  in  the  form  of  high \ninstitutional  complexity,  innovation  or  learning  potential  will  be  prioritized,  with  findings \ndisseminated to DMC decision makers and ADB programs and operations. One subproject will \nsupport the Institute for SDGs at Tsinghua University in cooperation with the UNDP office in the \nPRC to support testing of an innovative approach to integrating the SDGs into local 5-year plans \nin up to two cities in the PRC. At least two knowledge products will be published on the ADB \nwebsite by June 2020, with careful consideration given to the needs of the relevant target groups, \nincluding possible use of social media and digital approaches. \n \n11.  Output 3: Dialogue on effective localization of the Sustainable Development Goals \nenhanced. The TA will enhance dialogue, including among developing countries, by identifying \nand documenting good practices and by bringing together DMC representatives at the global and \nregional  levels  to  share  their  experiences  in  localizing  the  SDGs. The  GovTG  will  hold  a \nknowledge-sharing seminar in a DMC and an international seminar on Localizing Agenda 2030 \nfor Sustainable Development in Manila, preferably in close cooperation with the DeLoG,11 the \nDevelopment Assistance Committee Network on Governance of the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development,12 and UNDP. The events will be based on a review of good \npractices from the region. The event documentation will be posted on k-learn, Development Asia, \nand the GovTG website. \n \n                                                \n11 DeLoG is an informal network of 29 bilateral and multilateral development partners in the field of decentralization and \nlocal governance. It was established in 2006 and ADB joined in 2015. It functions as a network for knowledge \nexchanges among different organizations as well as a platform for joint learning. Development Partners Network on \nDecentralisation and Local Governance. www.delog.org/web. \n12 There is scope for cooperation on the work on social inclusion and SDG implementation included in the 2017\u20132018 \nNetwork on Governance work plan.  \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nADB Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).13 The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency and will administer the TA. The GovTG Secretariat \nunder the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will lead implementation. \nThe GovTG Secretariat will support (i) workshop preparation, implementation, and evaluation; (ii) \nsubproject identification, design, and implementation; and (iii) training and conferences.14 The TA \nwill  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  the  ADB  Results  Management  and  Aid \nEffectiveness Division in the Strategy and Policy Department and through the ADB-wide SDG \ncoordination  mechanism.  The  GovTG  Committee  will  serve  as  the  steering  group  for  TA \nimplementation, monitoring, and reporting. The TA will be implemented from October 2017 to \nSeptember 2020. All activities will be coordinated closely with regional departments and relevant \nDMC stakeholders and will be designed to add value to country, sector and thematic operational \npriorities in at least three regional departments. The TA will finance consulting services, reports \nand  other  knowledge  products,  and  workshops  and  conferences.  For  output  2,  a  call  for \nsubproject proposals from operational departments for up to $225,000 will be issued on ADB \nToday once the TA is approved. Selection of subproject proposals will be conducted by the \nGovTG secretariat in close consultation with the GovTG Committee based on criteria such as \noperational  relevance,  linkages  to  country  partnership  strategies,  degree  of  institutional \ncomplexity, innovation, and learning potential. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented in cooperation with partner organizations, such as the DeLoG, \nthe  Development  Assistance  Committee  Network  on  Governance  of  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development,  the  Open  Government  Partnership,  UNDP,  and \nrelevant country and regional institutions.  \n \n15.  The TA will support cross-sector and -thematic work by coordinating closely with relevant \nsector and thematic groups, particularly through ongoing SDG-related TA projects.15 For instance, \nthe Education Sector Group will be closely involved in the preparation of the education sector \ncase study for the Multi-Stakeholder Engagement Program in the North Pacific, and the Urban \nSector Group will be consulted on the PRC cities subproject under output 2. Cooperation with the \nSocial Protection Thematic Group will examine issues with respect to social protection indicators \nand financing strategies for social protection; and cooperation with the Environment Thematic \nGroup will emphasize pollution and loss of biodiversity. \n                                                \n13 Cofinancing ($500,000) from the PRC Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund has been requested; if \ngranted, this will be added through a change of scope, subject to management approval. The additional financing \nwill be prioritized for expanding output 2 subproject coverage.         \n14 Resource persons may include ADB staff with expertise in specialized areas to present in workshops. Travel costs \nand per diem for resource persons will be covered under the TA budget as indicated in Appendix 2.  \n15 ADB. 2017.
