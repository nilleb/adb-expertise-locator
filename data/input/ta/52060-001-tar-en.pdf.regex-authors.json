INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  While each country is unique, the Pacific small island developing states (SIDS)1 are \namong the most vulnerable in the world to natural hazards, climate change, and economic \nvolatility and shocks. This regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support \nthe Pacific SIDS in building awareness of the challenges they face; and review global experience \nto consider innovative options to work with partners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nto assist them in building resilience to economic, disaster, and climate-related shocks and \nstresses.  \n \n2.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030, 2  which  recognizes  the  distinct \ndevelopment challenges facing SIDS, many of which are fragile and conflict-affected situations \n(FCAS),3 and outlines ADB\u2019s differentiated approach to these groups of developing member \ncountries (DMCs). The TA is in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020;4 \nClimate Change Operational Framework, 2017\u20132030;5 and the Pacific Regional Operations \nBusiness Plan, 2019\u20132021.6 ADB approved the TA\u2019s concept paper on 13 December 2018, with \na budget of $450,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs are some of the smallest and most remote countries in the world and \nare on the front line in responding to climate change. Dispersion and distance to markets limit \neconomies of scope and scale, resulting in \u201cspeed limits\u201d  to growth. Narrowly based economies \nand often high reliance on imports mean that the economic growth is volatile, with SIDS among \nthe most-affected countries from global economic shocks. Infrastructure and service delivery \ncosts are very high. SIDS are extremely vulnerable to natural hazards\u2014a situation exacerbated \nby climate change. Pacific women and girls are especially vulnerable, with wide-ranging gender \ninequalities in access to employment and wage gaps, education outcomes, health outcomes, and \ngender-based violence both contributing to and exacerbated by economic shocks, disasters, and \nclimate risks. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Charter gives special attention to the needs of smaller and less-developed member \ncountries.7 This is reinforced in Strategy 2030\u2019s recognition of the need for a differentiated \napproach to addressing SIDS\u2019 extreme vulnerability and to assist them in meeting the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), including SDG5 on gender equality, to which ADB is committed. \nADB\u2019s active portfolio of investments in the Pacific SIDS has grown from less than $500 million in \n2005 to almost $2.7 billion at the end of 2017. Many of the smaller SIDS receive exceptional \naccess to concessional resources and will especially benefit from the ADB Board\u2019s decision in \nNovember 2018 to increase minimum concessional allocations for all countries to $13 million per \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) follows the United Nations definition of SIDS, which defines SIDS as all states \nthat participate in the Alliance of Small Island States. All 14 Pacific ADB developing member countries (DMCs) are \nconsequently classified SIDS.  \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  Seven of the nine DMCs currently classified by ADB as FCAS are Pacific SIDS: the Federated States of Micronesia, \nKiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. Even SIDS not classified as \nFCAS face severe capacity limitations and exhibit characteristics of structural fragility. \n4  ADB. 2017. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2017.

ADB has expanded its staff presence and will have staff in every \ncurrent Pacific DMC by 2020. Innovation marked ADB engagement in the Pacific SIDS. This \nincludes, among other things, joint cofinancing of investments with partners, successful efforts to \nmobilize more than $136 million in Green Climate Fund resources,8 the use of flexible instruments \nto provide rapid financing following disasters,9 and the development of potential new guarantee \ninstruments to mobilize greater private investment. Despite the daunting challenges facing the \nPacific SIDS, ADB investments have achieved significant results,10 and helped countries improve \ndevelopment  outcomes,  even  if  progress  has not  been  sufficient for all  countries  to  meet \nambitious Millennium Development Goal targets.11 \n \n5.  The Pacific SIDS are keen to work closely with partners, including ADB, to ensure that \ninternational support is sustained and continues to evolve to assist SIDS in overcoming unique \nchallenges and meeting their own development priorities. Continued innovation will be critical if \nADB is to maintain its historical leadership role when a wide range of partners are increasing \nsupport for the Pacific SIDS. This will require a broad consensus among shareholders on strategic \npriorities. ADB\u2019s SIDS DMCs look forward to the ADB Annual Meeting in Fiji in May 2019\u2014the \nfirst by any multilateral development bank in a Pacific DMC\u2014as an opportunity to highlight the \nunique vulnerabilities of SIDS, as well as development successes. ADB SIDS DMCs are hoping \nthat the Annual Meeting will provide a basis for ADB shareholders to consider further policy \nchanges,  as  part  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  13  replenishment  process,  to  apply  a \ndifferentiated approach to SIDS. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The TA will support the Pacific SIDS to (i) highlight to key development partners the \nextreme vulnerability of Pacific SIDS to climate change, natural hazards, and economic volatility, \nas well as SIDS\u2019 own successful efforts, with ADB support, to build resilience to shocks and \nstresses; (ii) undertake research to consider and suggest further policy and program changes by \npartners, including ADB, to engage innovatively to meet their needs; and (iii) consider options, \nbased on global experience, to mobilize greater sovereign and nonsovereign financing to build \nclimate change and disaster resilience. The TA will complement and build on other analytical work \nby ADB, including the Pacific Economic Monitor, which has undertaken policy analysis of issues \ncontributing to Pacific vulnerability; Pacific regional TA projects strengthening climate and disaster \nresilience of investments,12 considering new business processes to design, implement, and \nmaintain investments in fragile situations;13 institutional analysis on the interlinkages between \ngender, climate change, and disaster risk in Asia and the Pacific and priorities to strengthen \n                                                \n8  Green Climate Fund. Funding Proposal 8 Fiji urban water supply and wastewater management (November 2015), \nFunding Proposal 36 Pacific Islands renewable energy investment program (October 2016), Funding Proposal 52 \nNauru sustainable and climate resilient connectivity (October 2017), Funding Proposal 90 Tonga renewable energy \n(October 2018), and Funding Proposal 91 South Tarawa water supply project (October 2018). \n9  ADB. Cook Islands: Disaster Resilience Program; ADB. Regional: Pacific Disaster Resilience Program; and ADB. \nPalau Disaster Resilience Program. \n10 Between 2010 and 2018, ADB has financed (i) more than 1,000 kilometers of roads across the region, improving \naccess to services for more than 2 million people; (ii) broadband information and communication technology cables \nin Tonga, Samoa, and Palau, improving connectivity and reducing costs; (iii) 126 megawatts of new electricity \ngeneration\u2014about 10% of total installed capacity in the region; and (iv) improved water supply for 400,000 \nhouseholds and sanitation for 150,000 households.   \n11 Since ADB\u2019s establishment in 1966, the average life expectancy in Pacific SIDS, including for women, has increased \nfrom less than 60 in 1966 to more than 70; infant mortality has declined by two-thirds; and primary school enrollments \nhave increased from 69% in 1990 to 95% in 2018, with girls outnumbering boys at school in a range of countries. \n12 ADB.

The TA team will work closely with other bilateral and multilateral development \npartners to learn from their experience, both globally and in the Pacific, and where possible, \nidentify common solutions.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: increased resilience of Pacific SIDS to shocks \nand stresses resulting from economic volatility, natural hazards, and climate change. The TA will \nhave the following outcome: strengthened SIDS capacity to undertake reforms and to engage \nwith development partners, including ADB, to advocate for sustained engagement and identify \ninnovative solutions to build resilience to economic vulnerability and extreme exposure to natural \nhazard and climate change risks.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Gender-sensitive analysis of the vulnerability of the Pacific small island \ndeveloping states conducted and successful lessons in building resilience shared. The TA \nwill finance research on the particular vulnerabilities of SIDS, including an analysis of SIDS\u2019 \neconomic constraints and volatility as well as exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards and \nthe high and rising financing needs to build climate change and disaster resilience. The TA will \nalso finance research to explore lessons from successful efforts by SIDS, both in the Pacific and \nglobally, to build resilience and make progress towards SDGs, including SDG5 on gender equality, \nand the importance of sustained international support to do so. Initial research findings will be \ndisseminated in the lead-up to the ADB Annual Meeting in Fiji in May 2019. This will include \nseminar discussions with ADB shareholders, stakeholders from DMCs including gender ministries, \nregional organizations, bilateral and multilateral development partners, women\u2019s organizations \nand other civil society groups, and as appropriate through the media.   \n \n9.  Output 2: Lessons from policy reforms by ADB and other partners in taking a \ndifferentiated approach to small island developing states identified and shared. Initial \nresearch in 2019 will consider the evolving approach of other multilateral partners in the terms, \nvolume, and flexible instruments that are being extended to assist SIDS in making progress \ntoward achieving the SDGs, building resilience to economic shocks, and responding effectively \nto climate change and disaster risks. The research team will review, among others, the World \nBank\u2019s evolving approach to small states, including the establishment of a clear framework for \nexceptional eligibility to concessional resources with clear entry and exit criteria; and the status \nof  work  by  the  World  Bank,  United  Nations,  and  Commonwealth  Secretariat  to  develop \nvulnerability indices, including any gendered vulnerability measures. Analysis will include an \nassessment of the effectiveness of growing financial flows from a wide range of partners, including \nADB, to the Pacific SIDS (including options to strengthen the capacity of the Pacific DMCs to \nabsorb increased funding given significant financing needs to enhance resilience). \n \n10.

Research will consider ways SIDS are globally mobilizing resources\u2014\nboth sovereign and nonsovereign\u2014to build resilience to climate change and disasters, including \nproposals from the secretariat to Fiji\u2019s 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change presidency and Pacific regional organizations. This \ncould include specific analysis of (i) options to mobilize greater private financing for climate \nchange mitigation (such as by encouraging investments in renewable energy generation), and \nclimate adaptation and disaster resilience (such as by encouraging extended access to disaster \ninsurance for households and businesses); (ii) the potential scope to support SIDS to mobilize \nprivate financing for resilience objectives, such as through green bonds, catastrophe bonds, or \ngender bonds; and (iii) the global experience of SIDS and others in mobilizing financing for \nconservation efforts, such as debt-for-nature swaps and financing for SIDS\u2019 efforts to improve \nmarine protection. Research will consider options to support efforts both globally and by the \nPacific SIDS to address the common challenge of safeguarding healthy oceans. Analysis will \ninclude the gender impacts of different options. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2.   \n \n12.  The  governments  of  participating  DMCs  will  make  relevant  country  data  available, \nnominate participants to join capacity-building activities and meetings related to this TA, and \nprovide other in-kind contributions. As regional TA focused primarily on undertaking research and \ndisseminating analytical outcomes, ADB will not require significant inputs from the Pacific DMCs. \nADB will seek no objections from the relevant governments before any activities in a specific \ncountry instead of a no objection from all the Pacific governments before starting the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The Pacific Department will administer and \nimplement the TA over 24 months, from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020, in close \ncoordination with the Pacific Department resident missions and other relevant departments \nincluding the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. \n \n14.  Knowledge and research findings funded by the TA will be disseminated through various \nplatforms. This will include the preparation of analytical reports and brochures, awareness-raising \nseminars and workshops, and potentially a flagship event on options to build resilience to climate \nand disaster risks and the economic vulnerability of SIDS in the Pacific. ADB will make all outputs \nfreely available to the public through its corporate website and will produce limited copies for \ngeneral dissemination and targeted workshops in the ADB headquarters, representative offices, \nand resident missions. \n \n15.
