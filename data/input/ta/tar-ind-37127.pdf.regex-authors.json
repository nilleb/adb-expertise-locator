In its 2005 country program for India, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included a \nloan for the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. The project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA)1 for the Project was approved on 9 May 2003, and the consultants were fielded \non 2 February 2004. During the August 2004 Review Mission for the project preparatory TA, the \nGovernment of Kerala (GoK) requested that ADB provide additional TA to help (i) strengthen \ninstitutional capabilities of the state and municipal governments to efficiently manage activities \nunder the proposed ADB loan, and (ii) undertake preparatory works to establish the proposed \nKerala  sustainable  urban  development  fund  (KSUDF)  and  its  fund  management  company, \nKerala urban infrastructure company (KUIC). A follow-up mission visited Trivandrum from 19\u201321 \nOctober 2004 to discuss the objectives and scope of the TA and reached an understanding with \nGoK on the consultants\u2019 terms of reference and the implementation arrangements.2 The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Kerala,  relatively  a  small  state  with  32  million  inhabitants,  has  the  third  highest \npopulation density (819 people per square kilometer) in India, after West Bengal and Bihar. \nOfficially, Kerala\u2019s urban population is less than 30% of the total population. However, the high \npopulation density and dispersed settlement pattern have resulted in remarkable similarities \nbetween urban and rural areas. In fact, the Kerala landscape is characterized by a rural-urban \ncontinuum. Kerala has the best social indicators in India, including high literacy rate (91%), \nlonger life expectancy (73 years), and low infant mortality (11 infants per 1,000 live births).3 \nDespite the state\u2019s outstanding social accomplishments, Kerala\u2019s prospects for prosperity are \nthreatened by growing fiscal deficits and inadequate funding for new infrastructure development. \nThis impact accessibility to and affordability of basic urban services such as water supply, \nsanitation, primary health care, shelter, and social protection. \n \n3.  Since  the  1990s,  Kerala  has  implemented  massive  decentralization  of  both \nadministrative and fiscal powers to local self governments (LSGs), making them responsible for \nthe provision, and operation and maintenance of civic services. However, most LSGs are not \nyet  equipped  to  cope  with  the  increased  responsibilities;  their  administrative  capacity  is \ninadequate  and  finances  poor.  In  addition,  as  the  provision  of  civic  services  has  been \ntraditionally  considered  as  social  goods,  the  public  is  often  unwilling  to  pay  for  services \nprovided. The result is continuous deterioration of service quality and a huge backlog of new \ninvestments. The poor urban infrastructure has become a barrier to attracting new investments \nfor income generation despite the abundant high-quality labor available in the urban centers. \nThe main challenge is to break this vicious circle by introducing new initiatives for sustainable \nurban development. ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA identified the availability of new financing \nsources as the key success factor for breaking the vicious cycle hampering urban development.  \n \n4.  The state has been providing the LSGs with plan and nonplan grants for their capital \ninvestment needs and part of operation and maintenance needs. However, the unsatisfactory \nsituation of the state\u2019s finances is a concern and is bound to affect LSG finances. They are \nhighly dependent on the state. The Economic Review 2003 of Kerala State Planning Board \nhighlights that GoK\u2019s fiscal deficit remains high at 5.5% of gross state domestic product. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.  Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 January 2003.  \n3   Economic Review. 2003. State Planning Board. Thiruvananthapuram. \n ", "2  \nlarge revenue and fiscal deficits year after year, and the burgeoning debt burden provide little \nhope for any increase in urban investments from budgetary sources in the future. On the other \nhand, LSGs have to go a long way to improve their financial and managerial performance \nbefore making themselves attractive to bank borrowing or capital market issues. The private \nsector has so far shown only limited interest in Kerala, even though the policy environment has \nimproved somewhat. \n \n5.  Under the circumstances, the LSGs need to look at nontraditional methods of raising \nfinancial resources, while improving financial management and urban governance. The loan \nProject will make additional financing available to the urban sector through a  specialized \nfinancial intermediary, namely, the KSUDF and its fund management company. At the same \ntime, economic and financial disciple will have to be introduced in the municipal sector as the \nborrowers of the KSUDF are expected to service their debt out of the economic benefits directly \nor indirectly generated by the investments funded by such financial assistance. The KSUDF will \nalso  help  local  governments  strengthen  creditworthiness  by  introducing  double  entry \naccounting, improved budgeting and auditing, and disclosure standards. As seen in other states \nin India, such improvements, especially credible and transparent financial information and \nreliable credit tracks, would enable the LSGs to access the markets for loans on attractive \nterms. In the medium to long term, the proposed KSUDF can help LSGs mobilize additional \nresources for their investment programs on the strength of their own financial performance.   \n \n6.  In the past, the performance of ADB-assisted urban projects in India was hampered by \nweak capacity of state and municipal governments to implement the new initiatives. ADB\u2019s own \nreview found that up-front capacity building is essential to achieve the physical and institutional \ntargets  of  urban  projects.  While  ADB\u2019s  standard  practice  is  to  provide  capacity-building \nassistance only after approval of a loan project, the lessons learned clearly indicate the need to \nstrengthen the management and institutional capabilities of the state and local governments \nprior to loan effectiveness, particularly for those that are new to ADB-assisted urban projects. In \nthe case of Kerala, the need for up-front capacity building is even more critical as the state has \nno previous experience managing a large-scale urban infrastructure project in which financial \nresources are intermediated by a specialized financial institution. A timely setup of the KSUDF \nand its fund management company is therefore essential to the success of the proposed \nProject. In addition, a large number of state and municipal staff need ni tensive training to \nunderstand  activities  under  the  Project  and  the  requirements  for  successful  project \nimplementation. Advance actions are required for recruiting consultants and procurement to \navoid any delay in implementation. The elected representatives need to be trained for their role \nin achieving sustainable urban development, while local stakeholder participation in the early \nstage of project identification and development will have to be strengthened. \n \n7.  To  ensure  the  success  of  the  up-front  capacity  building,  the  state  and  municipal \ngovernments must put in place dedicated counterpart staff for project implementation. This is \ncrucial, even if personnel changes follow, as some of the experience and learning will be \nretained and shared within the state. The state agreed to strengthen the project management \noffice (PMO) to undertake preparatory activities for project management and institutional reform.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will assist the state and municipal governments in Kerala to efficiently manage, \ncoordinate, and monitor the urban infrastructure and governance improvement initiatives under \n ", "  3\nthe proposed ADB Project. In view of the lessons learned from other ADB-assisted urban \nprojects in India, particular emphasis will be given to up-front capacity building of the Project\u2019s \nexecuting and implementing agencies in the following key areas: (i) develop an efficient project \nmanagement system within the Local Self-Government Urban Department (LSGUD) to monitor \nand  supervise  all  activities  under  the  Project;  (ii)  train  key  project  stakeholders  on \nimplementation arrangements, ADB policies and procedures, and urban sector issues in Kerala; \n(iii) provide public consultations and a participation program to involve project beneficiaries in \nsubproject identification and development; and (iv) operationalize the KSUDF and KUIC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Project Management System. Under the TA, a modern financial management and \ninformation system will be set up for the PMO, project cities,4 and KUIC for effective monitoring \nof project activities and funds flow. The financial management system will comprise staffing, \ninternal control, funds flow monitoring, accounting and reporting, budgeting and control, as well \nas auditing of the project accounts. A procurement management system will be developed in \nline with ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies.  \n \n10.  Stakeholder  Training.  All  project  stakeholders,  including  state  officials,  municipal \ngovernment staff, and elected representatives, will be informed about project activities, and \ntrained in key areas:  \n \n(i)  urban development in Kerala\u2014infrastructure needs and constraints; \n(ii)  role of LSGs and the state in urban development; \n(iii)  data needs for project identification and development; \n(iv)  management information system for project implementation; \n(v)  ADB\u2019s safeguard policies for environmental protection, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous people; \n(vi)  ADB\u2019s policies and procedures for procurement and disbursement; \n(vii)  ADB\u2019s policies and procedures for recruitment of consultants; \n(viii)  project monitoring and evaluation; \n(ix)  repayment and financial management; \n(x)  community participation; and  \n(xi)  gender and development. \n \n11.  Opportunities will be also provided for the stakeholders to learn from the experiences of \nother states through study visits, inviting resources persons, and sharing lessons learned at \ncommon forums. \n \n12.  Public  Awareness  and  Participation.  To  involve  the  beneficiaries  in  project \nimplementation through a participatory approach and cooperation, the TA will design and \nimplement a public awareness program. The beneficiaries will be provided with information on \nthe Project and social and environmental issues. The public awareness program will help the \nbeneficiaries (i) understand the long-term benefits and short-term inconveniences of the Project; \n(ii) learn about the KSUDF and how to access funds from it; and (iii) identify potential projects \nand develop proposals for submission to the KUIC. \n \n13.  Operationalization of the KSUDF and KUIC. Under the project preparatory TA, a full \nbusiness plan was developed for establishing the KSUDF and KUIC. Based on the plan, the \n                                                 \n4  Kochi, Kollam, Kozhikode, Thrissur, and Thiruvananthapuram. \n ", "4  \nKSUDF and its management company will be set up and operational before effectiveness of the \nADB loan, estimated at around end-2005. Operationalization of the proposed KSUDF and KUIC \nrequires the following preparations to be supported under the TA:  \n \n(i)  Transitional analysis of the Kerala Urban Development Finance Company. \nThe company is expected to be integrated with the new KSUDF. Based on the \ntransition analysis carried out under the project preparatory TA, the TA will \nassess  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  KSUDF  and  recommend  an  orderly \nabsorption by the KSUDF. \n \n(ii)  Comprehensive needs assessment for municipal services. The financing \nfrom KSUDF will initially target all municipalities in the state, to meet their current \nand backlog investment requirements for basic urban services. For this, the \ninvestment and borrowing capacity of all municipalities need to be thoroughly \nassessed; this is a critical input to the future business plan of the KSUDF. The \nTA will undertake comprehensive needs assessment for all municipalities.  \n \n(iii)  Implementation of the business and operational plan for the KUIC. The state \nwill be assisted by consultants in implementing the business plan developed \nunder the project preparatory TA and building adequate capacity for project \ndevelopment,  appraisal,  and  management.  An  internal  accounting  and \ninformation system will be developed as well as detailed operational manuals.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $629,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $80,000 and local currency cost of $549,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$500,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $420,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The Government will contribute the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $129,000 equivalent for office accommodation, counterpart staff support, field \ntransport,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  and  other  administrative  expenses.  The \nGovernment will also provide all information required for the TA activities. Details of the cost \nestimate and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  LSGUD will be Executing Agency for the TA, through the PMO established during \nimplementation of the project preparatory TA. A full-time project director has been appointed to \nhead the PMO with full powers to make decisions regarding day-to-day management of TA \nactivities. The project director will be also responsible for overall coordination with ADB. A \nsteering  committee  was  formed  during  the  implementation  of  the  project  preparatory  TA, \ncomprising the chief secretary (as chairperson), principal secretary for finance, secretary for \nLSGUD, planning secretary, secretary for Modernizing Government Program, and secretary for \nPublic  Works  Department,  and  project  director  (as  member  secretary).  A  working-level \ncoordination committee has been formed to guide the project director on interdepartmental \nissues. While the project director will report to the LSGUD secretary, sufficient powers will be \ndelegated to the project director for daily management of TA activities; policy decisions will be \nmade by the steering committee. The PMO will provide full administrative and technical support \nto the consultants and coordinate all TA activities with the project municipalities. LSGUD will \nprovide adequate office space for the consultants with sufficient communication means. \n ", "  5\n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from January 2005 to December 2005. The \nconsulting services for the TA will total 34 person-months (2 international and 32 domestic), \nexcluding  the  inputs  of  local  institutions  to  assist  public  participation  and  training  for \nstakeholders. All consultants will be engaged on an individual basis by ADB, in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. The expertise required for consulting services is as follows: TA \ncoordinator and institutional development specialist (domestic, 8 person-months), procurement \nspecialist  (domestic,  3  person-months),  financial  management  and  accounting  specialist \n(domestic, 4 person-months), structured finance specialist (domestic, 3 person-months), and \ninstitutional  finance  and  legal  adviser  (domestic,  3  person-months),  urban  management \nspecialist  (domestic,  4  person-months),  municipal  engineers  (domestic,  5  person-months), \ncommunity  development  specialist  (domestic,  2  person-months),  and  urban  development \nspecialist (international, 2 person-months).
