During the 2002 country programming mission, the Government of Indonesia requested \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  demonstrating  the \napplication of carbon sequestration projects under the clean development mechanism1 (CDM) of \nthe Kyoto Protocol. A TA2 to this effect was included in ADB\u2019s 2003 country assistance plan for \nIndonesia. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Indonesia from 24 February to 4 March 2003 \nand  held  discussions  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  National  Development  Planning \nAgency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Environment (MOE), and Ministry of Forestry (MOFr), and \nreached  an  understanding  on  the  proposed  TA  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation \narrangements. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. The Mission also met with officials of \nthe bilateral and multilateral agencies that are actively involved in facilitating CDM projects, \nCenter for International Forestry (CIFOR), International Center for Research on Agroforestry \n(ICRAF),  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  other  stakeholders  in  the  climate \nchange program in Indonesia.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas (GHG)3, the emissions of which account \nfor  approximately  50%  of  the  total  global  warming  potential.  About  20%  of  global  GHG \nemissions are from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF)4. The Inter Governmental \nPanel on Climate Change predicts that the global average temperatures are likely to increase by \n1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius between 2001 and 2100 if no action is taken to reduce the carbon \ndioxide emission. The changes in global temperature will reduce the polar ice cover, raise the \nsea level, and cause unpredictable adverse weather patterns. The poor who normally live in \nmarginal lands are the most vulnerable group to adverse weather such as floods, droughts, and \nstorms. \n \n3.  During the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in \n1992, about 150 countries, cognizant of the need for international action to control global \nwarming, signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).5 In \n1997, the Conference of Parties (COP) of the UNFCCC agreed on an implementing protocol for \nGHG reduction at Kyoto, commonly called the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol required the \nparticipating developed countries and the economies in transition, referred to as the Annex I \ncountries, to meet agreed emission reduction targets by 2008\u20132012. According to the protocol, \nthe Annex I countries could meet their commitments through any of the following: (i) domestic \nactions, (ii) joint implementation of GHG reduction projects, (iii) emission trading of targets, and \n(iv)  CDM  by  GHG  reduction  projects  with  developing  countries.  The  CDM  allows  project \nproponents in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction (CER) units for the \nreduction in GHGs upon registration with the CDM Executive Board, established under the \nKyoto Protocol. The project proponent may sell, save, or barter the CERs, like a commodity, \nthrough private contracts, auction, or exchange markets. Industries and governments in Annex I \ncountries are the potential buyers and users of the CERs. The CERs provide income to the \nproject proponent in addition to standard project output. One of the CDM modes is carbon \nsequestration through reforestation and afforestation of denuded lands. The CDM procedures \n                                                \n1 The CDM is an innovative financing instrument for projects in developing countries that promote sustainable \ndevelopment and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 February 2003. \n3  Major GHGs of Indonesia are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.  \n4  Forestry includes harvesting practices that release GHGs. \n5 Currently 186 parties are members of the convention (185 countries and the European Economic Community). ", "2    \nfor  sequestration  have  been  delayed  because  of  difficulty  in  developing  methodologies  to \nvalidate, monitor, and verify the GHG reductions. The outstanding issues and details of CDM \nsequestration projects will be discussed at the ninth COP (COP9), scheduled in December \n2003. \n \n4.  Indonesia has 108 million hectares of forestland, or 45% of the forest in Southeast Asia. \nOf this forestland, 12% is presently idle and unproductive and are potential areas for carbon \nsequestration through forestation under the CDM. These lands could absorb 45\u2013300 tons of \ncarbon dioxide per hectare per year. CDM projects promote sustainable protection of forests, \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s forest policy, as continued preservation yields additional revenue through \nthe sale of CERs. However, a number of technical issues need to be resolved in LULUCF \nprojects that could be considered under the CDM. Some of the issues are associated with \ndefinitions,  such  as  baselines,  non-permanence,  leakage,  and  socioeconomic  and \nenvironmental impacts. The TA will address many of these issues and apply methodologies \nacceptable under the Kyoto Protocol for carbon sequestration projects in Indonesia.  \n \n5.  Due to the significance of the denuded and degraded forestlands in Indonesia a number \nof bilateral and multilateral organizations have provided TA for aspects of sequestration.6 Much \nresearch has also been done on the dynamics of carbon sequestration. The studies are mostly \nsmall-scale  and  are  aimed  at  estimating  carbon  sequestration  or  developing  strategies  to \npromote carbon sequestration. This TA will complement these studies by applying their findings \nand  developing  CDM-carbon  sequestration  projects  and  demonstrating  how  they  can  be \nimplemented.  \n \n6.  Since 1991, ADB has been assisting its developing member countries with climate \nchange issues through TAs.7 ADB is establishing a CDM facility to help bridge the gap between \nbuyers and sellers of CERs and ensure a fair return to developing member countries for their \nGHG abatement initiatives. This TA will be the first ADB TA on carbon sequestration, and will be \nfinanced through the Canadian Cooperation Fund for Climate Change administered by ADB. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The long-term goal is to assist the Government to (i) earn CER units for the reduction of \nGHG  emissions  through  the  CDM,  and  (ii)  promote  sustainable  forest  development.  The \nimmediate purpose is to develop the capacity of the Government for pilot testing a carbon \nsequestration project under the CDM to help Indonesian stakeholders better understand the \n                                                \n6  National Strategy Study on CDM in Indonesia, financed by the Government of Germany and the World Bank \n(2001); National CDM strategy for LULUCF, financed by the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID) and World Bank (2002); Institutional Capacity Building for Clean Development Mechanism in Indonesia, \nfinanced by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ).

", "      3\nprocesses, implications, and potential applications of the CDM. The TA outputs will include (i) a \nreview of previous studies and a synthesis of lessons learned on carbon sequestration as \napplicable under the CDM; (ii) a position paper on CDM-carbon sequestration projects for \nIndonesia for discussion at COP9; (iii) evaluation and simulation of LULUCF, with and without \nCDM participation, in at least two pilot areas; (iv) demonstration of the processes involved in \nearning  CERs  through  carbon  sequestration;  (v)  documentation  and  dissemination  of  the \nprocesses for earning CERs; and (vi) preparation of sustainable forest development strategies \nfor at least two pilot districts. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Review  of  Policies  and  Reports.  The  TA  will  review  and  analyze  (i)  all  national \npolicies, procedures, and institutional arrangements proposed for earning CERs from carbon \nsequestration; (ii) draft regulations relating to CDM-LULUCF projects; (iii) other related project \nactivities implemented (past and present) in Indonesia; and (iv) progress of the negotiation \nprocess on LULUCF at COP. The results of these analyses will be incorporated in the position \npaper to be discussed with the international community at the COP9 meeting in December \n2003. Following the COP9 meeting, the TA will incorporate decisions of COP9 in implementable \nprocedures for carbon sequestration projects. The TA will also (i) assess the global market for \ncarbon credits and the potential share of Indonesia in this market; and (ii) suggest processes for \nthe  development  of  baseline  data,  registration  procedures,  and  monitoring  and  verification \nprocedures for sequestration projects.  \n \n9.  Modeling of LULUCF in Pilot Areas. At least two districts that could earn CER credits \nwill be identified under the TA for pilot studies. The criteria for selecting will include the (i) \navailability of \u201cKyoto-lands\u201d (lands that meet the criteria for earning CERs through afforestation \nand reforestation) for smallholder and corporate investments for earning CERs; (ii) presence of \nagriculture and forest dependent local communities; (iii) presence of areas with at least three \ntypes  of  forestland  uses;  (iv)  availability  of  land  use  plans  and  programs  for  forestry \ndevelopment; (v) willingness to support the TA by fully participating in all TA activities; and (vi) \nwillingness to provide suitable office space and staff. \n \n10.  The TA will develop strategies for sustainable forest development in the selected pilot \ndistricts through a simulation modeling. The activities will include (i) undertaking an inventory of \nland use in the districts; (ii) identifying boundaries and preparing a base line with regard to \nsources  and  sinks  of  carbon  through  LULUCF;  (iii)  determining  the  ownership  patterns  of \nforested  areas  and  potential  Kyoto-lands;  (iv)  examining  land  use  patterns  and  livelihood \nopportunities in the project areas, with particular emphasis on income and employment; (v) \nsimulating agroforestry and reforestation models in potential Kyoto-lands in the districts and \nestimating their technical and socioeconomic feasibility and environmental sustainability; (vi) \ndeveloping and analyzing scenarios of trends for the pilot Kyoto-lands with and without CDM \nprojects,  using  geographic  information  systems;  and  (vii)  assessing  the  transaction  costs \ninvolved in obtaining CERs for various project types including small scale CDM forestry, taking \ninto consideration property rights covered by tenurial arrangements and the approval process \ninvolving local government, national designated authority, operational entities, and the CDM \nBoard. The TA will apply methodologies and techniques developed in Indonesia by research \norganizations and institutions, as well as suitable methodologies and techniques developed in \nother countries. The modeling exercise will also consider forest models like home gardens that \nwill  provide  benefits  from  carbon  sequestration  and  from  commercial  exploitation  while \nmaintaining environmental sustainability. The TA will raise awareness among stakeholders on \nthe potential of CERs in their economy. ", "4    \n  \n11.  Demonstration of Processes on Obtaining CER Approval. The TA will demonstrate \nthe preparation of project design documents (PDD) for at least 2 pilot Kyoto-lands within the \npilot districts, and the processes involved in obtaining CER units. It will validate and strengthen \ninstitutional arrangements proposed by the national strategy study on CDM in forestry and will \ncomplement the study by MOE and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), on \ninstitutionalizing the designated national authority (DNA). The TA outputs from pilot areas will \nmeet the needs of the DNA. The TA will develop procedures and design the forms required for \nthe approval process.  \n \n12.  Capacity Building. The TA will help remove policy and institutional barriers to carbon \nsequestration identified by the LULUCF national strategy study. It will provide for capacity \nbuilding at all stages of the approval process and in streamlining the processes and reducing \ntransaction costs. The TA activities are limited to capacity development and will not involve \ngenerating  credits.  The  activities  will  involve  (i)  creating  awareness  among  smallholders, \ncommunity  forest  developers,  and  private  large-scale  investors  on  CDM  potential;  and  (ii) \ntraining all potential stakeholders, including staff of local government authorities, BAPPENAS, \nDNA, Ministry of Agriculture, MOE, MOF, and MOFr. The TA will support a number of local of \nworkshops and seminars, and at least two national workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent, including $400,000 in \nforeign exchange and $ 475,000 equivalent in local currency.  The Government has requested \nADB to finance $700,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $300,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Canadian Cooperation \nFund for Climate Change. The Government of Indonesia will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $175,000,  through  the  provision  for  office  accommodation, \ntransport, and remuneration and per diem for its staff. Detailed cost estimates and financing \narrangements are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOE, the focal ministry for climate change in Indonesia, will be the Executing Agency, \nwith overall responsibility for supervising the TA, and implementing all activities that are national \nin scope. MOE will be responsible for establishing the approval process for all CDM-related \nactivities, capacity building at the national level, stakeholder workshops, and liaison with other \nministries and local governments.  The local governments of the two pilot districts will support \nthe MOE in implementing the TA at the district level. They will be responsible for land use \ninventory,  LULUCF  modeling,  stakeholder  analysis,  and  the  preparation  of  project  design \ndocument. MOFr will be responsible for ensuring that all TA activities and the documents \ndesigned are in line with national forest policies and regulation. MOFr will provide assistance in \nland  use  inventory  and  in  the  preparation  of  PDDs  by  providing  equipment  and  technical \nexpertise as appropriate. MOFr will also ensure high technical quality of all TA activities under \nits mandate and will work closely with MOE at the national level to ensure that the processes \ndeveloped and demonstrated under the TA are acceptable to all concerned agencies. MOE will \nprovide suitable office space in its headquarters in Jakarta and appoint a senior officer as a full-\ntime project director. The project director will be assisted by one deputy director nominated by \nMOFr and three support staff. MOE will arrange with the pilot districts for the provision of office \nspace and appointment of a district project manager and three technical support staff. \n ", "      5\n15.  To  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  a  national  steering  committee  (NSC)  will  be \nestablished. It will be chaired by the BAPPENAS deputy for natural resources and environment. \nThe  NSC  will  comprise  senior  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  local \ngovernment, MOE, MOF, MOFr, NGOs, and private stakeholders, and a specialist on CDM \nprocesses from the Government or the private sector. The NSC will meet quarterly and as \nnecessary. In addition to taking guidance from the NSC, the project director will consult with the \nnational committee on climate change. MOE will facilitate the establishment of district steering \ncommittees in the pilot districts, chaired by the district heads. The committees will comprise \nrepresentatives  from  MOFr,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  local  government,  environment,  district \nforest office, NGOs, and two other stakeholders from the community. The national and district \nsteering committees will meet quarterly and as often as required.  \n \n16.  A total of 52 person-months of consulting services comprising 10 person-months of \ninternational  and  42  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  an \ninternational consulting firm. The team leader, an international consultant, will also be the CDM-\nLULUCF specialist. The domestic LULUCF specialist will be the deputy team leader for the \nconsultant  team.  International  expertise  will  be  limited  to  CDM  policies,  regulations  and \ninstitutions, and the preparation for approval of PDDs by designated operational entities. The \ndomestic  expertise  will  include  CDM,  land  use  planning,  institutional  development,  social \ndevelopment, legal, and environment aspects. CIFOR and ICRAF8 will be directly selected \nunder a separate contractual agreement for undertaking the land use inventory and LULUCF \nmodeling. Indicative schedule of activities and the outline terms of reference of the consultants \nare given in Appendixes 3 and 4. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method, and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nConsidering the innovative nature of the TA, the consultant will submit a full proposal, while \nCIFOR and ICRAF will submit simplified technical proposal.  Any equipment purchased under \nthe TA will be obtained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months, from 1 September 2003 to 28 \nFebruary 2005. The main reports of the TA will include an inception report, the position paper, \nan interim report, an approved project design document for at least two pilot district areas, and \nthe final report. Two national workshops will be conducted to disseminate the findings of the \ninterim report and the final report. The TA implementation will be closely coordinated with the \nADB CDM facility, when established.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Canada, through the \nCanadian Cooperation Fund for Climate Change, for Carbon Sequestration through the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                \n8  CIFOR and ICRAF are international centers with mandate for forestry and agroforestry research, and have carried \nout a number of research projects on CDM, LULUCF, and forest modeling.
