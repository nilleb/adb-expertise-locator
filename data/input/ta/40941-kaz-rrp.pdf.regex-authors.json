I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for a proposed credit \nguarantee (Guarantee) to cover the principal payments of notes for an aggregate amount of up \nto  $125,000,000  (2007-A  Notes)  in  connection  with  a  diversified  payment  rights  (DPR) \nsecuritization by ATF Bank JSC (ATF or the Bank) (the Project). \n     \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Kazakhstan Economy: Overview and Outlook \n2.  Kazakhstan maintained its solid economic growth in 2006 (in excess of 7.4% during \nJanuary\u2013June  2006)  based  on  foreign  direct  investments  in  the  energy  sector,  increased \npipeline export capacity, conservative fiscal and monetary policy balancing increased public \nprograms  with  price  stability,  and  strong  banking  system  regulation  and  supervision.  The \ncountry has benefited recently from higher oil prices and greater exports, both of which have \nincreased  foreign  currency  inflow  and  assisted  debt-servicing  efforts.  For  these  economic \nstrengths, Kazakhstan is rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s, BBB by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and BBB by \nFitch  (all  long-term  issuer  default  rating).  Appendix  1  provides  details  on  the  country\u2019s \nmacroeconomic outlook. \n \n3.  Nevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe economy given potential volatility in the international oil market. Small- and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) and other manufacturing companies are currently underrepresented in the \nnational economy.1 Creating conditions for growth of the corporate and SME sector is of key \nimportance in striving to diversify the economy.2  \n \nB.  Banking and Capital Markets in Kazakhstan \n4.  Improvements in the economic and operating environment of Kazakhstan\u2019s financial \nsector  have  resulted  in  rapid  growth  during  the  past  5  years,  leading  to  enhanced \ncreditworthiness and commercial profiles for domestic banking. In particular, the Government \nand National Bank of Kazakhstan, the central bank, have undertaken structural reforms to \npromote consolidation and improve the overall viability of the banking system. \n \n5.  Encouraged by this improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year (albeit from a \nvery  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and  profitability.  This  is \n                                                 \n1 The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. Because the SME sector is \nrelatively more labor-intensive, providing approximately 40% of total employment, SME growth is significantly more \ninclusive and pro-poor in nature. \n2  Asian Development Bank. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kazakhstan. Manila, 17. The \nGovernment has a declared policy of fostering SME development by promulgating SME laws (for instance, the Law \non State Support to Development of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan) and establishing organizations \nto implement this policy. The policy includes various support measures, provision of services via business \ndevelopment centers, and small business loans. An exhibition and information center (a wholly state-owned joint \nstock  company)  works  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  program  to  support  SMEs.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment set up the SME Support Fund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The fund\u2019s main objective \nis to effectively use financial resources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for projects \nand activities aimed at supporting SMEs. The fund is tasked to (i) broaden access to finance for SMEs, (ii) \neffectively use state and nonstate resources aimed at SME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) \nprovide consultations for SMEs. ", "2   \nespecially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking system. Appendixes \n2 provide a more detailed analysis of the Kazakh banking system. \n \n6.  One of the key challenges facing the financial sector is the development of the nascent \n(debt and equity) capital markets, especially with respect to the corporate sector (Appendix 2). \nTo widen their access to funding, many banks are keen to enter the securitization markets, \ndomestically  as  well  as  internationally.  Securitization  in  Kazakhstan  is  currently  limited  to \noffshore transactions, due to the lack of respective regulations for domestic issuance. \n \nC.  Future Flow Securitization: Overview \n1.  Securitization Background \n7.  Securitization  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  dominant  means  of  capital  formation \nthroughout the world, particularly in the United States (US) and Europe. In developed markets, \nasset securitization serves a number of purposes: (i) supporting public policy objectives such as \nbroad home ownership and development of financial markets (especially capital, retail, and \nmortgage markets); (ii) addressing regulatory requirements for financial institutions, especially \ncapital  adequacy  and  lending  limit  requirements  applicable  to  banks;  (iii)  transferring  risk, \nespecially in the context of nonperforming assets and portfolio diversification; and (iv) providing \nan alternative means of raising finance. In developing Asia, however, securitization is still in a \nnascent stage. Appendix 3 provides a general description of the securitization process and \nAppendix 4 an overview of the various benefits derived from securitization. \n2.  Future Flow Securitization and Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n8.  Future  flow  securitization  became  popular  in  emerging  markets  in  the  1990s  as  a \nmechanism to reduce sovereign-related risk and provide more attractive access to international \ncapital  markets  for  the  stronger  emerging  market  issuers.  A  future  flow  transaction  is  a \nsecuritization  of  a  company\u2019s  future  and  existing  offshore  receivables.  Future  flow \nsecuritizations mitigate, in this case, many of the sovereign risks associated with an emerging \nmarket borrower by capturing cash flows offshore. Appendix 5 gives a more detailed description \nof  the  structure  of  future  flow  securitization  transactions.  Of  all  future  flow  transactions \nworldwide, none has so far defaulted.   \n \n9.  In Kazakhstan, future flow transactions are only beginning to be introduced. Appendix 6 \ngives details of outstanding future flow asset-backed securities deals, and Appendix 7 provides \na brief overview and introduction to DPR securitizations. 3  \n                                                 \n3  In a DPR securitization, the future cash flows result from payment orders or electronic messages requested by \noffshore obligors instructing a bank to make a payment to a beneficiary other than the bank. This may take the form \nof payments to local exporters, foreign direct investments, tourism-related payments to travel agencies, personal \nwire transfers or workers\u2019 remittances, and payments to local servicers. Payments to banks relating to such \npayment orders are owned by the bank and not the named beneficiary. In other words, the receiving bank does not \nact as a trustee of these funds but the bank is performing a service for the sending bank, gets paid for doing so by \nthe sending bank (and thus becomes the owner of these flows), and incurs a matching obligation to the beneficiary. \nIn this regard such payments are similar to deposits made into a deposit account. While the bank will have an \nobligation to pay the local beneficiary (recipient) an equivalent amount of money (in the stipulated currency), the \nbank does not have the obligation to deliver the exact same funds received from the sender (money is fungible). In \nother words, during the period from the receipt of the funds from the sender by the bank (from its foreign branch or \ncorrespondent bank) up to the stipulated delivery for the funds by the bank to the local beneficiary, the bank has \neffective title to these funds (similar to the 2-day float after a check is deposited). On a continuing basis, the \naverage daily float can be calculated and made the basis of the amount of foreign currency received and then ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \nA.  Project Conceptualization \n10.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) took its first steps into the Kazakh market with \nloans to Bank TuranAlem JSC4 ($75 million) and Alliance Bank JSC ($50 million).5 Both loans \nwere disbursed in July 2006. These transactions, apart from their direct development impacts in \nterms of SME development, introduced ADB as a participant in the market. These two loans \nhave been well received, were noted in the market, and have provided a number of follow-up \nopportunities.  ADB  decided  that  in  a  next  phase  of  financial  sector  development  it  would \nconcentrate on development of the country\u2019s capital markets.  \n \n11.  The ADB Board of Directors endorsed the first steps in this direction by approving, in \nSeptember 2006, ADB\u2019s guarantee for the DPR securitization undertaken by Alliance Bank JSC \nand in March 2007 a guarantee for a DPR securitization issued by Kazkommertsbank JSC.6 \nBoth transactions have successfully reached financial close. To build a sustainable business \nmodel for ADB, replication of certain business ideas is important. In line with this approach, ADB \noriginated a small number of follow-up investment opportunities in Kazakhstan, which meet \nADB\u2019s development criteria and goals as well as ATF\u2019s credit standards.  \n \n12.  The proposed transaction follows a similar structure as the Alliance Bank JSC and \nKazkommertsbank JSC DPR securitizations and was conceptualized in recognition of the need \nto address the lack of diversity in banking system funding sources, and introduce a new asset \nclass and new investors to Kazakhstan\u2019s capital markets.  \n \n 13.  In Kazakhstan, this would be the second DPR securitization of a medium-sized (tier II)7 \nprivate sector bank. Introduction of this product will facilitate ATF\u2019s activities in diversifying its \nfunding sources and provide longer tenor funding to its borrowers.  \n \n14.  In  Kazakhstan,  DPR  securitization  has  been  introduced,  but  to  fully  establish  the \nsecuritization market and DPR as an established asset class, more securitization deals have to \nbe completed. ATF has previously tried to use this funding technique but was unable to tap the \ncapital markets and ended up leveraging its DPR only in the banking market (via DPR loans). \nThe proposed transaction will give ATF full access to the capital markets. In addition, this \ntransaction is expected to help other banks of similar size and with a similar rating to access this \ntype of funding. The Project has however a two-pronged approach as it also supports the \ndomestic policy dialogue for capital market development.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nassigned to the special purpose vehicle. From this perspective, what the bank is assigning is its expected float and \nnot the remittances themselves that it expects to transact from foreign senders. \n4  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n7  Kazkommertsbank JSC, Halyk Bank JSC, and Bank TuranAlem JSC are tier I. \n ", "4   \nB.  Project Selection and Strategic Approach  \n15.  In line with the revised ADB Medium-Term Strategy II,8 which identifies the financial \nsector as the top \u201cCore I\u201d focus, and the 2006 cofinancing strategy paper,9 ADB aims to build its \ncofinancing operations, especially guarantee operations. ADB sees the best strategic fit of this \nproduct in applying it to transactions related to capital markets, especially in the form of credit \nguarantees for securitization transactions. Appendix 8 provides an overview of remittance flows \nin Central Asia, which form the basis for DPR securitization transactions. ADB is working on a \nregional  study  on  remittances  and  poverty  in  Central  Asia  and  South  Caucasus,  which is \nexpected to be presented in July 2007. \n \n16.  ADB is targeting a total of three to four DPR transactions (with different banks) in \nKazakhstan to justify the high opportunity cost of transaction structure development and in an \nattempt to ensure full development impact. The proposed DPR transaction, however, has the \nunique feature that ADB is proposing to only provide a partial guarantee (principal only) instead \nof a full guarantee (principal and interest). This represents a new step in the development of \nADB\u2019s efforts. However, due to the structure of this guarantee, it is envisaged that a \u2018AAA\u201d rating \nwill still be achieved. This allows the issuer to tap into the very wide investor base that is \ninterested in top grade issues (i.e., AAA rating) combined with exposure to local banks.  \n \n17.  In parallel, other markets will be developed, so that once ADB exits the Kazakh DPR \nsecuritization  market  a  smooth  transition  is  ensured.  ADB  is  concentrating  these  efforts \ncurrently  in  Azerbaijan,  Pakistan,  and  Philippines.  In  addition,  DPR  transactions  can  be \nstructured as loans at an early stage before the markets are sufficiently developed for the \nissuance of DPR-backed bonds.  \n \n18.  In line with this strategy, ADB is also providing (i) hands-on support to the Philippine \nGovernment to interpret and apply the newly enacted Securitization Law in connection with DPR \n(worker remittance) securitization, (ii) technical assistance10 to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) for the formulation of a new securitization law, and (iii) support for the \nKazakhstan  Government  in  formulating  the  necessary  implementation  rules  for  its  newly \nenacted Securitization Law to allow domestic securitization. \n \n19.  This strategy and the proposed transaction are fully in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy.11 The strategy states that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems \nand  capital  markets,\u201d  since  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability, \nmobilizing savings, and ensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for \npro-poor growth.\u201d A more effective capital market promotes more efficient channeling of savings \nto market-based investments that foster more sustainable economic growth. The development \nof securitization deepens and broadens capital markets, benefiting both issuers and investors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

The bank has \nconsistently gained market share, and is now one of the leading banks in the country (11% \nmarket share for corporate banking, 13% for SME business, and 13% for mortgage loans as of \nend-2006). Balance sheet growth in 2006 was primarily driven by expansion in lending activities \n(retail and SME). ATF operates through 32 full service branches and 62 cash settlement offices \nin Kazakhstan.  \n \n21.  Currently, ATF is rated by three rating agencies: Moody\u2019s Investor Services Limited; \nStandard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services; and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Table 2). On 25 June 2007, it was \nannounced that Bank Austria Creditanstalt, responsible within the Italian UniCredito Group for \ncommercial banking activities in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, has signed a \nshare  purchase  agreement  to  acquire  a  majority  shareholding  in  the  Bank.  Following  this \nannouncement, the rating agencies are expected to upgrade ATF\u2019s credit ratings. The rating \nagencies have already placed ATF on credit watch with positive outlook, reflecting the strong \nupside potential for ATF's creditworthiness following the change of control. Standard & Poor\u2019s \nexpects  that  ATF  will  benefit  from  operational,  managerial,  and  financial  support  from \nUniCredito. ATF\u2019s long-term rating is expected to benefit from a one-to-three notch uplift from \nthe current stand-alone rating.  \n \nTable 2: ATF Bank Credit Ratings \n \nItem  Moody\u2019s  S&P  Fitch \nLong-Term  Ba1  B+  BB- \nShort-Term  NP  B  B \nOutlook  Stable  Stable  Stable \nFitch = Fitch Ratings, Inc.; Moody\u2019s = Moody\u2019s Investor Services Limited; S&P = \nStandard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services. \nSource: Source: Fitch, Moody\u2019s, S&P. \n \nB.  The Business \n22.  ATF provides a broad range of banking services to large companies and SMEs, and is \nexpanding its retail business focusing on high- and middle-income individuals. \n \n23.  Since its inception in 1995, ATF has evolved from an institution primarily focusing on \nfunding its clients\u2019 trading activities to a universal bank. This transition has been accelerated by \nrapidly evolving market conditions, and by the necessity to diversify in order to defend its market \nposition. ATF benefited from the fact that it began its operations as a new entity; it did not have \nto carry a burden of problems inherited from the past (i.e., bad asset quality as did some of its \npeers that were founded on the remnants of the banking system of the former Soviet Union). \n \n24.  Corporate  Banking.  Corporate banking has historically been ATF\u2019s most important \nbusiness. ATF provides the full spectrum of lending products, i.e., short-, medium-, and long-\nterm financing, trade finance, documentary operations, letters of credit, and guarantees. ATF \nhas long-standing relationships with some of the country\u2019s largest corporates, but its customer \nbase is relatively well diversified because ATF is independent from any large industrial group \n(unlike many of its competitors). ATF\u2019s loan concentration has been decreasing since 2003, and \nin 2006 its top 10 customers represented 20% (28% in 2003) of the portfolio; the top 50 \n ", "6   \nrepresented 40% (58% in 2003). The corporate loan portfolio has grown from 2003 to 2006, but \nis projected to grow by only 24% CARG in the next 3 years as ATF increases its focus on the \nSME and retail segments.  \n \n25.  SMEs. SMEs continue to represent a focus of ATF\u2019s business strategy. ATF has a \ndedicated department for SMEs, and SME business has been growing rapidly (130% CARG \nfrom 2003 to 2006). ATF plans to increase the share of SME loans in its total portfolio (currently \napproximately  20%)  as  well  as  its  market  share  in  the  SME  business  segment,  which  is \ncurrently estimated at 13%. To cater to the specific needs of its SME customers, ATF launched \nseveral strategic initiatives including plans to open 21 dedicated centers providing business \nservices to SMEs. The SME business is intended to be grown rapidly which seems a logical \nstrategic step given ATF\u2019s size and its prevailing expertise. At the same time, the SME market \nsegment offers good margins and good potential for sustainable growth in the future. \n \n26.  Retail. Retail loans accounted for 14% of total loans at the end of 2006. ATF focuses on \nthree main products: mortgages, consumer loans, and car loans. ATF is one of the leading \nmortgage loan providers in the country with a market share of 13%. The quality of ATF\u2019s retail \nportfolio is good. ATF is expanding its retail distribution network to 150 dedicated retail centers \nat the end of 2007 and 229 at the end of 2009.  \n \n27.  ATF is striving to gain market share in the retail business by focusing on the upper and \nmiddle classes of the population, hence avoiding the \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d style of banking where \nhigh overheads are incurred in obtaining many small deposits. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n28.  The proposed transaction is a credit guarantee to be issued in favor of investors in notes \nwith a value of up to $125,000,000 (Series 2007-A Notes) issued by an SPV. The notes are \nbacked by DPR originated by ATF. The credit guarantee will only guarantee the principal of the \nSeries 2007-A Notes. The total amount of the issuance is expected to potentially also include \nunwrapped notes (Series 2007-B Notes) of an amount to be specified after the due diligence of \nthe rating agency (Moody\u2019s).  \n \n29.  DPR usually take the form of SWIFT,12 MT102 and 103,13 and MT202 payment order \nmessages.14  These  payment  orders  are  generated  as  part  of  the  international  financial \noperations  of  ATF.  Payment  orders  are  created  as  a  result  of  ATF\u2019s  role  as  a  financial \nintermediary between foreign payors wishing to send funds to Kazakhstan and residents of \nKazakhstan receiving these funds, ATF proposes to securitize its MT100 DPR, denominated in \ndollars (ATF DPR).15  \n                                                 \n12  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is an international messaging system \nowned and maintained by the member banks (payment order only, no settlement). MT103/103+ are sent by the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction.  \n13  MT102 is principally a set of bulked customer transfers that meet certain criteria (e.g., common correspondent \nbanks, common currency, or common value date). MT103 is a customer transfer wherein either the sending party \nor the payer or both is not a financial institution. MT103 is a more structured version.  \n14  MT100 (including MT102 and 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from \nsenders to payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through \nbanks. MT200 (including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from \nsenders to payees that are financial institutions. \n15  ATF\u2019s MT200 DPR are miniscule, as well as flows not denominated in dollars (less than 3%). ", "  7\n \n30.  The transaction is part of a securitization program of ATF\u2019s existing and future dollar \nMT100 category DPR. The initial issuance under the program was through a $100 million loan \n(Series 2006-A loan). Notes in the capital markets were not issued as this did not seem feasible \nat the time. The Series 2006-A loan issued on 4 April 2006 has a final maturity of 5 years, a \nprincipal  repayment  grace  period  of  2  years,  with  equal  quarterly  repayments  thereafter, \nresulting in a weighted average life of 3.6 years.  \n \n31.  The guarantee is anchored in the 2001 technical assistance to Kazakhstan for Preparing \nthe Urban Small Business Development Project.16 The TA was to promote development of the \nurban SME sector, review the legal and regulatory framework for SMEs, and foster financial \nintermediation.  This  assistance  will  play  a  central  role  in  supporting  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations in the financial sector and in strengthening domestic banks. \n \nB.  ATF\u2019s Diversified Payment Rights \n1.  Introduction \n32.  ATF generates DPR by acting as a recipient of payment orders, which arise through a \nvariety of transactions, including from merchants inside Kazakhstan exporting goods or services \nto  their  customers  outside  of  Kazakhstan,  foreign  direct  investment,  Kazakhstan  flows,17 \noverseas transportation, and personal remittances. The payors who wish to make payments to \nbeneficiaries in Kazakhstan who have accounts with ATF, request their banks, in the majority of \ncases  located  outside  Kazakhstan,  to  initiate  transactions  for  the  payment  of  amounts  to \nbeneficiaries in Kazakhstan through ATF, thereby generating payment orders.  \n \n33.  Processing payment orders is a basic banking business that offers significant benefits \nsuch as the ability to (i) strengthen correspondent banking relationships and obtain favorable \nterms on other banking products and businesses from its correspondent banks, (ii) attract new \nclients in cases where payment orders are the initial contact the client has with ATF and monitor \nATF\u2019s  borrower\u2019s  cash  flows,  (iii)  provide  high-quality  clearing  services  to  its  clients  in \nKazakhstan, (iv) generate foreign currency, (v) expand daily treasury activity, and (vi) improve \nliquidity.  \n \n2.  Depository Banks \n34.  With respect to payment orders received by ATF, these orders are accomplished by \nmaking a deposit into one of ATF\u2019s accounts held with one of its correspondent banks (the \ndepositary banks). ATF receives DPR collections at approximately 44 depositary banks in 15 \ncountries, with 19 depository banks located in the US. Currently the designated depositary \n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  Preparing  the  Urban  Small  Business \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n17  Pursuant to current Kazakhstan currency regulation, a Kazakhstan resident cannot make a foreign currency-\ndenominated payment in favor of another Kazakhstan resident; however, they may transfer their own funds from an \naccount with one Kazakhstan bank in favor of another account held with another Kazakhstan bank. Such a \npayment  order  would  be  settled  outside  Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan  flows  are  collections  that  arise  when  a \nKazakhstan bank (whether through a branch, representative office, or other office located inside or outside of \nKazakhstan) or a foreign bank\u2019s Kazakhstan branch or other office has initiated a payment order. Kazakhstan flows \nare often the result of Kazakhstan companies moving their own dollar and euro funds. \n ", "8   \nbanks (DDBs) 18 are (i) The Bank of New York (New York); (ii) American Express Bank Ltd. \n(New York); and (iii) Citibank (New York).19  \n \n3.  Historical Flows \n35.  ATF, a SWIFT member since 1995, has consistently experienced growth in payment \norders processed. ATF\u2019s DPR business shares a similarity with Kazakhstan\u2019s export industry as \nATF\u2019s DPR include those that relate to exports to various countries, of which the most common \nhave been the US, Netherlands, Great Britain, Russian Federation, PRC, Italy, France, and \nSwitzerland. DPR volumes also tend to reflect Kazakhstan\u2019s economic growth patterns.  \n \n36.  Seasonality.  ATF\u2019s pool of DPR flows as a whole is not subject to any significant \nseasonality, although year-end volumes do tend to be higher than the yearly average. ATF \nbelieves that such increases are a typical year-end phenomenon, as companies attempt to \nsettle their trades before the end of the financial year. \n \n37.  Currency. The payment orders sold by ATF are denominated in dollars.  \n \n \nC.  Guarantee Fee \n38.  ADB will receive a guarantee fee. The guarantee fee amount and computation will be \nmarket  driven  using  similar  DPR  securitization  structures  in  Kazakhstan  and  Turkey  as  a \nbenchmark. The guarantee fee will be set in accordance with ADB policies by the Credit \nEnhancement and Pricing Committee.  \n \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \nA.  Justification  \n1.  Investment Objective \n39.  ADB\u2019s objective in the proposed transaction is to develop Kazakhstan\u2019s securitization \nmarket to (i) diversify funding options; (ii) procure access to longer term funds, specifically for \nmedium-sized private sector banks; and to (iii) attract a new set of investors.  \n \n40.  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee  will  increase  interest  in  DPR  securitization  from  Kazakhstan.  By \nestablishing  a  credit  history  for  ATF,  the  Project  enhances  its  ability  to  raise  funds  in \ninternational capital markets, obtain longer tenor funds than currently possible in the market, \nand build market confidence in medium-sized banks. ATF\u2019s business lines generating DPR will \nbe under constant scrutiny by rating agencies forcing ATF to adopt and comply with best market \npractices. For the investor, the proposed transaction will provide access to a new market; \ndiversify  its  portfolio;  and  presumably  receive  higher  returns  than  government,  bank,  and \ncorporate bonds. The transaction will boost investor and creditor confidence, both international \n                                                 \n18 A correspondent bank qualifies as ATF\u2019s DDBs if the correspondent bank processes more than 12% of ATF\u2019s \ncollection for two consecutive quarters, has good credit quality, and is experienced in handling DPR. ATF signs an \naccount agreement with the qualified correspondent bank to make them a DDB. \n19 Pursuant to certain account agreements, the DDBs are obligated to deposit all funds received (or paid) by them in \nrespect of any DPR into a collection account maintained with each such DDB from where they are transferred by \nthe primary DDBs to the concentration account held by the Bank of New York.  \n ", "  9\nand domestic, in Kazakhstan\u2019s banking system, and increase depositor confidence in the local \neconomy and banking system. \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s  second  objective  is  to  foster  corporate  and  SME  financing.  In  turn,  ADB  is \nassisting the Government in its efforts to steer the Kazakh economy toward more sustainable \nSME-led  growth  while  diversifying  away  from  the  dominance  and  dependence  on  natural \nresources industries. The Project allows ATF to extend the tenor of its borrowings to up to 7 \nyears, 2 years longer than the maximum tenor it has been able to obtain from the market. In turn \nATF will be able to lengthen its tenor for its customers. The transaction will therefore bridge an \nunwanted maturity gap and allow ATF to match its assets and liabilities more closely. In addition, \nthe  securitization  will  allow  ATF  to  access  lower  cost  funds,  which  will  make  ATF  more \ncompetitive and allow it to pass savings to its customers.  \n \n2.  Development Outcome \n42.  The Government is striving to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on the oil \nsubsector.  This  entails  improving  access  of  the  nonoil  sectors  to  finance  and  making \ninvestments in these sectors more attractive to investors. The Project seeks to achieve this by \nhelping develop the capital market through diversifying funding sources for borrowers and \nincreasing the availability of investment grade products for investors.  \n \n43.  Although the concept of DPR securitization is not entirely new to the market, the number \nof issues in Kazakhstan has been limited. For the emerging market issuers, ADB\u2019s guarantee \nachieves a rating that is higher than the country\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating. The Project \nwill also address the need to educate investors and borrowers on the risks inherent in such a \nstructure  by  issuing  unguaranteed  notes.  In  addition,  the  Kazakh  DPR  securitizations  are \namong the very few completed in Asia and form part of a handful of future flow transactions \nexecuted so far in Asia. An increased number of DPR securitizations will lead to a better \nunderstanding and development of this financing technique. Hence, this proposal is expected to \nfacilitate the development of a full-scale securitization market in Kazakhstan, and have spillover \neffects for the whole of Asia. ADB will provide for the first time a partial guarantee (instead of a \nfull guarantee) for a future flow securitization, which will further widen the potential investor base \nand contribute to the diversification of funding sources.  \n \n44.  Secondly, the proposed transaction will allow ATF to service its core businesses and \ndirectly contribute to expanding financial intermediation to SMEs and corporates\u2014including \nthose  in  rural  areas\u2014via  ATF\u2019s  existing  and  growing  branch  network,  as  well  as  foster \ndiversification of loan portfolios.  \n \n45.  Increase Access to International Capital Markets. DPR securitization is designed to \nmitigate sovereign risk so that noninvestment grade borrowers can access longer term financing \nat lower interest rates than they could by borrowing directly. The innovative structuring of these \ntransactions  has  allowed  many  noninvestment  grade  borrowers  in  developing  countries  to \npierce the sovereign credit ceiling and obtain financing at significantly lower interest costs and \nfor longer duration. ADB\u2019s involvement as Guarantor enhances the borrower\u2019s credit rating.  \n \n46.  Securitization  of  future  flow  and  existing  receivables  can  provide  a  way  of  raising \ndevelopment  finance  for  many  low-  and,  in  particular,  middle-income  countries,  especially \nduring times of low liquidity and heightened perception of sovereign risk. During a liquidity crisis, \ndeveloping countries need innovative ways to raise external finance. Future-flow receivable \n ", "10  \nsecuritization provides such a means of securing credit ratings for new issues that pierce the \nsovereign ceiling and thereby reduce the cost of funding. Future flow securitizations also attract \na  much  wider  class  of  investors  because  of  their  investment  grade  rating.  Moreover,  by \nestablishing a credit history for the borrower, these deals enhance the ability and reduce the \ncosts of accessing capital markets in the future. \n \n47.  From the investors\u2019 point of view, the attractiveness of this asset class lies in its good \ncredit rating and its good performance in good and bad times. No debt defaults on rated future \nflow asset-backed securities issued by developing country entities have been recorded despite \nrepeated liquidity and solvency crises.20\n \n48.  Expansion  of  the  Formal  Banking  System.  As  local  banks  realize  the  funding \nadvantages inherent in packaging securitized DPR flows, they will become more competitive in \nterms of fees charged for DPR and remittance transfers, which will encourage both senders and \nbeneficiaries to become bank clients and thereby enter into the formal banking system.  \n \n49.  Improve Financial Conditions of Local Banks. Securitization will help improve the \nasset/liability management of local banks through access to longer term/lower rate funding \nsources. For example, banks can replace short-term borrowings in hard currencies with longer \nterm funding through securitizations. Improvements in ATF\u2019s financial conditions will in turn lead \nto more stability of the region\u2019s banking system. \n \n50.  Preparing for Domestic Issuance. Ultimately, these transactions are paving the way \nfor domestic securitization transactions, possibly once ADB has completed its policy project. \n \n3.  Value Added of ADB  \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s proposed guarantee will add value by (i) enabling the transaction and a wider \ndistribution of the notes, especially to Asian investors; (ii) increasing and diversifying funding \nsources and investment products in the market; (iii) providing access to longer term financing for \nATF, thus improving ATF\u2019s management of its assets and liabilities; (iv) helping develop the \nsecuritization  and  SME  market  in  Kazakhstan  by  extending  a  partial  guarantee;  and  (v) \nincreasing investor confidence in Kazakhstan\u2019s relatively young capital market by extending a \npartial guarantee instead of a full guarantee. ADB contributes to the development of the market \nfor this type of transaction and asset class for the second tier banks in Kazakhstan. \n \n4.  Development Impact Measurement \n52.  ADB will measure the expected development impact of the Project. These performance \nmeasures follow the multilateral development banks\u2019 Evaluation Cooperation Group's Standards \nfor Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact is measured in \nthree  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  Project  itself,  (ii)  economic \nsustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Appendix 9 shows the development impact \nframework. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20  The asset class withstood the test of the Mexican peso crisis in 1994/95, the Asian liquidity crisis in 1997/98, and \nthe Ecuadorian debt default in 1999. An interesting example is the receivable deal of PTCL, Pakistan's telephone \ncompany, which continued to perform even in the face of selective default on sovereign debt. ", "  11\nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n53.  The  Project  has  been  assigned  a  category  C  environmental  classification  and  is \nclassified  as  category  C  with  respect  to  indigenous  people  and  resettlement.  ATF  will  be \nrequired to establish an environmental management system following guidelines and to build \ncapacity for implementing it. At least one ATF officer will attend ADB-sponsored environmental \nmanagement training. ATF has already established a European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment environmental management system. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n54.  ADB undertook due diligence on ATF\u2019s procedures in respect of money laundering and \nfinancing of terrorism. ATF has been advised of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998, as \namended to date) and policy relating to combating money laundering and the financing of \nterrorism.21  ATF will undertake to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  preventing  corruption,  money \nlaundering  activities,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  in  the  reimbursement  and  indemnity \nagreements.  Further,  ATF  will  undertake  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The \ndocumentation between ADB and ATF will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential \nviolation of these undertakings.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n55.  ADB  will  enter  into  an  acceptable  guarantee  agreement  and  other  required  legal \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed Guarantee by the Board. These agreements will \nbe on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n56.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nGuarantee. The Guarantee will not become effective until ADB has received such confirmation. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n57.  I am satisfied that the proposed guarantee would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the credit \nguarantee  to  cover  the  principal  payments  of  notes  for  an  aggregate  amount  of  up  to \n$125,000,000 in connection with a diversified payment rights securitization by ATF Bank JSC, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a maturity of 7 years and conditions substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n \n11July 2007 \n \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n ", "12  Appendix 1   \nKAZAKHSTAN: MAJOR MACROECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS \n \nA.  Economic Outlook \n \n1.  High oil prices, foreign investment, and good macroeconomic management underlie the \ncontinuing economic boom in this oil-rich export economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil subsector, averaged 10.3% per annum during 2001\u20132005. GDP growth \nreached 9.4% in 2005 and is set to grow to $65.3 billion in 2006 and $84.8 billion in 2008. \nFurthermore, the private sector, representing 65% of GDP, is increasingly driving growth in the \neconomy.1  \n \n2.  These factors helped lift 2005 general budget revenues by 4.7 percentage points to \n28.2% of GDP. This large gain was somewhat offset by the increase in budgetary spending \nbefore the December presidential election. The general government budget recorded a surplus \nof 0.6% of GDP, from a slight deficit of 0.3% in 2004. In view of its strong financial position, the \nGovernment made early repayments totaling $850 million on its external public debt, reducing \nthe total to about 4% of GDP at the end of 2005. The Government approved the 2006 state \nbudget in November 2005. It raised revenues by 2% of the previous year\u2019s GDP, reflecting \ngovernment projections for greater receipts from oil. The increase is earmarked for public \ninvestment and social programs.2 \n \n3.  High world commodity prices helped boost exports by 40.0% to $28.7 billion; oil and \nmetals accounted for more than two thirds of the increase. Imports also increased by 37%, \ndriven largely by machinery, equipment, and nonprecious metals. The trade surplus improved \nby about 45% to $9.8 billion, but the deficit on the services, income, and transfers account \nworsened  sharply.  The  latter  stemmed  from  greater  payments  for  construction,  freight, \ninsurance, and information technology services, as well as a near doubling of income payments \nto foreign direct investors, nearly all associated with oil sector development. Consequently, the \ncurrent account surplus in 2005 improved only marginally from a year earlier to $750 million \n(about 1.3% of GDP). For the first time in 5 years, official reserves at the National Bank of \nKazakhstan (NBK) declined, although they recovered substantially in the first 2 months of 2006 \n(footnote 2). \n \n4.  Gross official reserves stood at $7.1 billion at the end of 2005 (equivalent to 37 months \nof imports of goods and services); while year-end foreign asset holdings of the National Fund of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, which saves a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral revenues \nfor future generations, amounted to $8.0 billion. During the year, the total of official reserves and \nfund  assets  strengthened  by  about  $684  million  (about  1.2%  of  GDP)  to  $15.1  billion. \nOutstanding public external debt was reduced by about $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion (about 4.2% of \nGDP) in the 9 months to 30 September 2005. During this period, private sector external debt \n(excluding oil and gas intracompany debt) increased sharply by $4.6 billion to $16.6 billion \n(about 33% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in recent years\u2014mainly local bank borrowing \nfor onlending\u2014was largely a response to the differential between available foreign borrowing \nrates and domestic lending rates of about 15% for tenge loans and 11% for loans denominated \nin foreign currency (footnote 2). \n \n \n                                                 \n1 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Merrill Lynch estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in \n1998. \n2  Asian Development Bank. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006. Manila. ", "    Appendix 1  13\n5.  The tenge continued to appreciate against the dollar (2.9%) on an average annual basis, \nreflecting export earnings, foreign direct investment, and private external borrowing. However, \ntighter market conditions in the final months of 2005 resulted in a 2.2% depreciation on an end-\nof-year basis. As in the previous year, the real effective exchange rate rose by about 6% year-\non-year, due to inflation differentials. Largely because of future substantial oil-related revenues, \nreal appreciation may continue in 2006 (footnote 2).   \n \n6.  The  medium-term  outlook  is  positive,  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, continuation of economic diversification, good macroeconomic management, \nand political stability. In 2006, GDP growth is expected to be sustained at 8.5%. Moreover, \nmacroeconomic stabilization should continue, with inflation estimated at about 6.5% in 2006. \nDespite  recent  substantial  increases  in  wages  and  social  spending,  the  Government  has \nmaintained sustainable fiscal and monetary policies, which have limited budget deficits and \ninflation. General government debt will continue to decrease in the next few years by about \n1.0%\u20131.5%  of  GDP  annually.  Additionally,  with  the  National  Reserve  Fund  for  excess  oil \nearnings and tax revenues expected to reach about $7.4 billion by year-end 2005, a substantial \nfiscal buffer has been created.3 Despite increased external borrowing by commercial banks, the \noverall external position remains strong.\n \n \n7.  Overall growth during 2000\u20132004 was led by strong contributions from capital and total \nfactor productivity. The contribution of labor accumulation declined continuously, suggesting that \nthe  economy  is  likely  approaching  full  employment.  According  to  government  data,  the \ncontributions of capital accumulation, total factor productivity, and labor growth to the average \nGDP rate of expansion of 10.4% during 2000\u20132004 were 6%, 3.2%, and 1.2% (footnote 2, p. \n98\u201399).  \n \n8.  The hydrocarbons subsector has grown at an average of 16% a year since 2000, and \nwill remain the engine of growth in the medium term. Its share in GDP, including production and \nrelated services, jumped from 11% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2005, and is expected to continue \nrising  as  production  capacity  increases.  Sector  growth  has  been  fueled  by  large  capital \ninvestments; oil and gas have received 60% of total investment, equivalent to 15% of GDP \nduring 2000\u20132005. Two thirds of the oil and gas investment came from the private sector. The \nshare of hydrocarbons in GDP will increase over the medium term as large projects come \nonstream, although investment in the sector is expected to taper off as a share of total fixed \ninvestment (footnote 2). \n \n9.  Nonoil output has risen at an average of 7% a year since 2000 and been sustained at \n25% of total investment, representing 6.5% of GDP during 2000\u20132005. Within the nonoil sector, \nconstruction and services have been the most dynamic. Their combined share in GDP and total \nemployment has increased to 65% and 60% (footnote 2). \n \n10.  In contrast, the share of manufacturing and agriculture in GDP has declined, reflecting \nlow capital investment. The average annual investment rate stood at 3% of GDP during the \nperiod, with half of that from the public sector. If the investment rate in the nonoil sector \nmaintains its recent trend, nonoil growth could remain at 7%\u20138% a year in the medium term\u2014\nand even higher if the Government manages to diversify the economy and stimulate the private \nsector. Removing impediments to regional trade and accession to the World Trade Organization \nwould advance development of both the nonoil and private sectors (footnote 2). \n                                                 \n3  The National Fund of Kazakhstan was created in 2001 to accumulate a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral \nrevenues for stabilization purposes and to save for future generations. \n ", "14  Appendix 1   \n \n11.  Small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development is hampered by difficulty in \naccessing  capital,  especially  debt  financing,  at  sustainable  market  rates;  and  the  lack  of \nconfidence of SME entrepreneurs in the banking subsector, which is still burdened with an \nimage created during the Soviet time. In an economy where access to capital is constrained and \nbanks have a legacy problem of attracting customers, as they are not seen as reliable funding \nsources,  serious  negative  consequences  can  arise.  These  hurdles  must  be  overcome  if \nKazakhstan wants to move out of its heavy dependence on oil exports and develop the SME \nsegment, especially manufacturing. \n \n12.  Continuing growth, job creation in the private sector, and pro-poor growth have raised \nliving standards. In 2004, real per capita incomes rose by 13%. The percentage of people living \nbelow the subsistence minimum4 fell from 19.8% in 2003 to 15.0% in 2004. Unemployment \ndeclined from 8.8% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n \nB.  Political and Regional Background \n \n13.  Kazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution of the former Soviet Union. Since then, Kazakhstan has experienced significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy to a market-oriented, democratic model. The transition was initially marked by political \nuncertainty and tension, a recessionary economy marked by high inflation and instability of the \nlocal currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \n14.  Since 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program of economic reform designed \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation; it \nis  more  advanced  in  this  respect  than  some  other  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States. However, as with any transition economy, no assurance can be given that \nsuch reforms and other reforms described elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such \nreforms will achieve all or any of their intended aims. \n \n15.  Kazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, and \nwheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent upon good relations with its neighbors to ensure its ability \nto export. In addition to taking various steps to promote regional economic integration among \nneighboring  countries,  Kazakhstan  signed  an  agreement  in  September  2003  with  Belarus, \nRussian Federation, and Ukraine to create a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin common economic policies, harmonization of legislation implementing such policies, and \ncreation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone is to \ncreate a free customs area within which member countries would enjoy free movement of \ngoods, services, capital, and labor. Another step toward integration is that the member countries \nalso intend to look at ways to coordinate their fiscal policies, credit and currency policies, and \ngovernment policies. These efforts will support economic integration within the Commonwealth \nof Independent States, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access to export routes. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  The subsistence minimum is a measure of poverty. Calculated by the State Statistics Agency, it comprises the cost \nof a basket of 70% food items and 30% goods and services. The poverty line is established as a fixed percentage \nof the subsistence minimum, and is used for determining households\u2019 social assistance allowances and eligibility \nfor such assistance. In 2004, the subsistence minimum was T5,427 or equivalent to $40 a month. ", "    Appendix 1  15\nC.  Macroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n \n16.  Since Kazakhstan is heavily dependent upon export trade and commodity prices, it was \nparticularly affected by the Asian financial crisis in early 1998 and by the Russian Federation \ncrisis later that year, both of which exacerbated the problems associated with falling commodity \nprices. Because Kazakhstan\u2019s economy is negatively affected by low commodity prices and \neconomic instability elsewhere in the world, the Government has promoted economic reform, \ninward foreign investment, and diversification of the economy. Notwithstanding these efforts, \nlow  commodity  prices  and  weak  demand  in  its  export  markets  may  adversely  affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s economy in the future. \n \n17.  The  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \nincluding a significant privatization program, promotion of high levels of foreign direct investment \n(particularly in the oil and gas sectors), and introduction of an extensive legal framework. \nDespite  uneven  progress,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  extensive  economic  transformation \nduring the last 12 years. Since mid-1994, the Government has adhered to a macroeconomic \nstabilization  program  aimed  at  curtailing  inflation,  reducing  the  fiscal  deficit,  and  boosting \ninternational  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  National \nStatistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following the adoption of a floating \nexchange rate policy in April 1999. It rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in 2002, 9.2% in 2003, and \n9.4% in 2004. However, no assurance can be given that GDP will continue to grow, and any \ndecrease in GDP or in the rate of GDP growth in subsequent years could adversely affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s development. \n \n18.  The  tenge  is  convertible  for  current  account  transactions,  although  it  is  not  a  fully \nconvertible currency outside Kazakhstan. Between 1991, when Kazakhstan began its transition \nto a market-based economy, and April 1999, NBK maintained a managed exchange rate policy. \nThis  policy,  although  permitting  the  general  trend  in  the  exchange  rate  to  reflect  market \nconditions, involved official intervention aimed at limiting fluctuations. Depressed export markets \nin 1998 and early 1999 caused considerable pressure on Kazakhstan\u2019s managed exchange \nrate, and resulting official intervention in the foreign exchange markets led to losses on foreign \ncurrency  reserves.  In  response  to  these  pressures,  the  authorities  instituted  a  number  of \nexpenditure cuts; took revenue-increasing measures; and in April 1999, NBK floated the tenge. \nThe tenge fell by 64.6% against the dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation \nof 10.7% as of 31 December 1998. Following the adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in \n1999, the tenge continued to depreciate against the dollar, although at a much slower rate. It \ndepreciated  by  4.6%  in  2000,  3.8%  in  2001,  and  3.3%  in  2002.  The  tenge  subsequently \nappreciated against the dollar by 7.3% during 2003 and 9.9% during 2004. Then during the first \n6 months of 2005, it depreciated against the dollar by 4.0%, to T135.26 as of 30 June 2005. \nSince then the tenge has gradually appreciated against the dollar; as of 11 May 2006, NBK \nreported the official T/$ exchange rate as T122.87/$1. \n \n19.  While NBK has stated that it has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate policy, \nany  subsequent  decision  to  support  the  exchange  rate  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on \nKazakhstan\u2019s public finances and economy. \n \nD.  Monetary Policy \n \n20.  NBK maintains a managed floating currency regime and does not set any official targets \nfor the tenge exchange rate. It uses interventions on the foreign exchange market as one of the \ntools to manage systemic liquidity. Monetary policy implementation is complicated by strong \n ", "16  Appendix 1   \nprivate capital inflows, rising oil earnings, and buoyant domestic demand. M3 increased 49.2% \nper annum on average during 2000\u20132004, and was up a further 50.2% in 2005. Cash in \ncirculation expanded 34% per annum on average during 2000\u20132004, and increased another \n35% in 2005. The big buildup of money in the National Reserve Fund ($8.2 billion, or 14.4% of \nGDP as of the end of February 2006), along with selling short-term notes and deposits, has \nassisted  partial  sterilization  of  the  domestic  liquidity  produced  by  NBK  interventions. \nNevertheless, the authorities are worried about the rise in monetary pressure on the overall \ninflation process. With no formal target, the Government aims to keep annual inflation in the \n5%\u20137% range during 2006\u20132008 to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment; in February \n2006 the consumer price index increased to 8.7%. During the next 2 years, stronger social \nspending along with further tax cuts will continue to put upward pressure on disposable income \ngrowth and consequently prices. Market observers therefore expect that with some easing of \nthe tight fiscal stance, greater exchange rate flexibility will be allowed to keep inflation in check. \nNBK might allow the tenge to appreciate in 2006/07 to restrain price expansion. \n \nE.  Regulation of Banking  \n \n21.  In September 1995, NBK introduced strict prudential requirements for the operation and \ncapital adequacy of banks. In addition, an institutional development plan was prepared for \nleading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to prepare their accounts \nin accordance with international financial reporting standards and to apply the Basel Committee \nnorms within the period determined by NBK on a case-to-case basis. Further, Kazakhstan \nbanks are required to join a bank-funded deposit insurance scheme and be audited annually by \na public accountancy firm approved by NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading international \nfirms. Following legislative changes in July 2003, the Financial Markets Supervisory Agency \nwas formed, and as of 1 January 2004 it took responsibility for most of the supervisory and \nregulatory functions in the financial sector, which had previously been performed by NBK. The \nagency\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial markets and financial institutions in \nKazakhstan. \n \nF.  Implementation of Market-Based Economic Reforms \n \n22.  The need for substantial investment in many enterprises has driven the Government\u2019s \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant by the Government, although major privatizations in key sectors have taken place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational telecommunications company. However, a need remains for substantial investment in \nmany sectors of the Kazakhstan economy and in some areas economic performance in the \nprivate sector is still constrained by inadequate business infrastructure. Furthermore, the extent \nof noncash transactions in the economy and the size of the shadow economy adversely affect \nimplementation of reforms and hamper the efficient collection of taxes. The Government has \nstated that it intends to address these problems by improving bankruptcy procedures, business \ninfrastructure,  and  tax  administration;  as  well  as  by  continuing  the  privatization  process. \nImplementation of these measures in the short term has produced few positive results, and \nimproved results may not materialize until the medium term, if at all. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  17\nBANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS IN KAZAKHSTAN \n \n1.  Encouraged by the improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year during the last \n5 years (albeit from a very low base), while generally maintaining healthy asset quality and \nprofitability. This is especially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking \nsystem. Market observers expect this pace of growth to be sustained for the coming years. \nWhile focusing mainly on the domestic market, some Kazakh banks are increasingly expanding \ntheir operations in other regional Commonwealth of Independent States countries, including \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Russian  Federation,  and  Ukraine,  in  order  to  expand  and  diversify  their \nbusinesses and market exposure. \n \nA.  Overview of the Kazakh Banking Market \n2.  Commercial banks in Kazakhstan can be divided into four groups: (i) large local banks \n(tier I banks),1 such as Bank TuranAlem JSC and its principal competitors, Kazkommertsbank \nand Halyk Bank; (ii) banks under foreign ownership, such as ABN AMRO Bank Kazakhstan, \nHSBC Bank Kazakhstan, and Citibank Kazakhstan; (iii) second tier (tier II banks) medium-sized \nbanks with regional operations; and (iv) smaller local banks. The decrease in the number of \nbanks from 184 in 1996 to the current 342 is primarily attributable to the ongoing sector reform \nundertaken by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK).  \n \n3.  Three  dominant  banks\u2014Bank  TuranAlem,  Halyk  Bank,  and  Kazkommertsbank\u2014\ncollectively represented 55.8% of total system assets and 50.7% of capital as of 30 June 2006. \nEstablished in 1990, Kazkommertsbank is the country\u2019s largest bank in terms of assets and \nsecond largest as measured by shareholders\u2019 equity. It had total assets of $9.85 billion and \ncapital of $734.8 million as of 30 June 2006. Bank TuranAlem is the second largest bank in \nterms of assets ($9.68 billion) and the leading bank in terms of capital ($1.03 billion). Halyk \nBank is the third largest bank in terms of assets\u2014approximately $6.44 billion. In the past few \nyears, however, the tier II banks have been increasingly taking more market share from the tier I \nbanks. In particular, the big three banks\u2019 collective market share declined from 62.3% in 2003 to \n55.8% as of 30 June 2006. This trend is expected to continue into the coming years.  \n \n4.  Banking reform began in 1996 with the introduction of international prudential standards, \nincluding requirements on capital adequacy, liquidity ratios, transparency as to the auditing of \nbanks  by  local  and  international  auditors,  harmonization  of  local  accounting  practices  to \ninternational financial reporting standards, and personnel training programs. In addition, NBK \nrequired commercial banks to adopt recapitalization and corporate enhancement plans with the \naim of boosting their abilities to attract long-term, private investors. In 2000, guidelines were \nestablished for bank inspections and for periodic reporting by commercial banks to NBK (and \nnow  also  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency,  which  currently  is  the  banking \nsupervision body in Kazakhstan). In 2003, all banks were requested to develop and install \ninternal risk management systems. \n  \n                                                 \n1  Technically, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) would be the first tier. The terminology used here therefore \nonly refers to commercial banks below NBK. \n2  As of August 2005, 34 banks were operating in Kazakhstan, excluding the National Bank of Kazakhstan, \nincluding two fully state-owned special-purpose banks and 14 banks under foreign ownership. As of mid-2004, 27 \nforeign banks had representative offices in the country. \n ", " 18  Appendix 2   \n5.  According to published financial statements, the total assets of the banking system \nincreased by 60% in 2004 and 68% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to $46.52 billion. \nDuring the same period, the total capital of the banking system increased by 46% in 2004 and \n63% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to approximately $4.6 billion (Table A2.1 \nprovides details). \n \nTable A2.1: Structure of Banking Aggregate Liabilities  \n(as of 1 January 2006) \n     \n  Amount   \nLiability  (T billion)  % of Total  \nClient deposits  2,533  62.2 \nInterbank deposits  185  4.5 \nLoans from the Government  3  0.1 \nLoan from international financial organizations  27  0.7 \nLoans  from  other  banks  and  organizations  577  14.2 \nperforming certain types of banking operations \nREPO transactions with securities  164  4.0 \nSubordinated debt  185  4.5 \nOutstanding securities  273  6.7 \nOther creditors  128  3.1 \n  Total  4,073  100.0 \nREPO = repossessed. \nSource: Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation and Supervision of Financial Market and \nFinancial Organizations. \n \nB.  Credit Standing of Commercial Banks \n6.  The financial standings of Kazakhstan\u2019s banks vary. As of 30 September 2005, 18 of the \n34 commercial banks had registered capital of over T2 billion, 15 banks had share capital of T1 \nbillion to T2 billion, and one bank had registered capital of T500 million to T1 billion. No banks \nhave registered capital of less than T500 million, and any bank whose capital falls below this \nlevel is required to submit an application for voluntary reorganization into an entity performing \nonly  limited  banking  operations  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency.  As  of  30 \nSeptember 2005, aggregate provisions of Kazakh banks on overdue receivables were T52.5 \nbillion. \n \n7.  As of 31 December 2005, all of the commercial banks licensed in Kazakhstan were in \ncompliance with prudential regulatory requirements on capital adequacy, single borrower limits, \nliquidity ratios, foreign currency limits, and reserve requirements. As of 31 December 2004, two \ncommercial  banks  had  failed  to  comply  with  seven  prudential  regulatory  requirements, \ncompared to one noncompliant bank as of 31 December 2003 and one as of 31 December 2002. \nThe noncompliant banks did not meet any of the current liquidity ratios, own capital ratios, single \nborrower exposure ratio, open currency position ratio, and maximum asset investment ratio. \nProvisions for bad debts of all banks operating in the Kazakhstan banking subsector as of 31 \nAugust 2005 totaled T52.5 billion. \n \nC.  Access to Funds \n8.  Total liabilities of the banking system increased by 68.4% to T4,073 billion as of 1 \nJanuary 2006 (Table A2.1). The most significant impact was on client deposits, which increased ", "    Appendix 2  19\nby 56.5% to T2,533 billion and accounted for 62.2% of aggregate banking system liabilities. The \nincrease was attributed to a combination of economic growth and rise in population income. \n \n9.   The  lack  of  a  well-functioning  domestic  interbank  market  continues  to  hamper  the \nliquidity management of banks. Interbank deposits only account for 4.5% of the aggregate \nbanking system\u2019s liabilities. The banks are therefore turning to the international debt capital \nmarkets for funding enabled by the improving country rating. Access to the international loan \nmarkets by medium-sized banks has also improved. Several banks were able to raise financing \nfrom the international loan market. \n \nD.  Overview of Kazakh Capital Markets \n \n10.  Three types of government securities are available: T-bills, T-bonds, and inflation-linked \nand variable bonds. Due to the high oil revenues and a cautious fiscal stance, the Government \ndoes not need to borrow in the local debt market. Due to the growth of the pension fund system \nin Kazakhstan, the country has a serious shortage of good domestic long-term investment \nassets for these funds. The country\u2019s bond market is therefore very illiquid, as most of the \noutstanding issues are held by local pension funds. \n \n11.  Turnover at the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange increased by 37% in 2005 (Table A2.2). \nHowever,  exchange  turnover  growth  has  been  concentrated  on  repurchase  transactions, \nprimarily on government securities. Turnover of the corporate sector only accounted for around \n3.4% of total turnover in 2005. The most active participants in the exchange (i.e., buying and \nselling securities) are the banks, such as Bank TuranAlem, Kazkommertsbank, ATF Bank, \nEurasian Bank, and Alliance Bank. \n \nTable A2.2: Comparative Data on Kazakhstan Stock Exchange Turnover  \n($ million) \n \n          YTD  June \n  2004  2004 %  2005  2005 %  June  2006 % \nMarket Sector  Volume  of Total  Volume  of Total  2006  of Total \nForeign Exchange  9,449  16.1  12,044  15.0  12,687  22.1 \nGovernment Securities  5,558  9.4  4,754  5.9  2,189  3.8 \nCorporate Shares  977  1.7  1,040  1.3  800  1.4 \nCorporate Bonds  853  1.4  1,715  2.1  1,800  3.1 \nRepurchasea 42,012  71.4  60,848  75.7  39,854  69.5 \n  Total  58,850  100.0  80,403  100.0  57,331  100.0 \nYTD = year-to-date. \na Corporate and government securities. \nNote: Only deals of the primary market and purchase-sale deals on the secondary market, including state blocks of \nshares are considered in the sector of equities and corporate bonds. In the government securities subsector, only \ndeals of the primary market and purchase-sale deals on the secondary market are considered. \nSource: Kazakhstan Stock Exchange. \n \n12.  Market capitalization of the stock market increased from $3.94 billion in 2004 to $10.52 \nbillion in 2005, and was $30.56 billion as of June 2006. The increase in market capitalization \nwas partly explained by the growth in the number of listed companies from 84 at year-end 2005 \nto 107 in June 2006. Liquidity, however, remains a concern where corporate share turnover only \naccounted for 1.3% of total exchange turnover in 2005 (Table A2.2). Domestic companies still \nfear the loss of control that would result from having institutional minority shareholders, while the \n ", " 20  Appendix 2   \ninstitutional investors are concerned about insufficient protection of their minority interests. This \naccounted for the underdeveloped status of the stock market.  \n \n13.  The corporate debt securities market of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange is represented \nby 176 bond issues including 2 issues by nonresidents (JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch) as of June \n2006. The financial sector remains the leader in terms of debt issuance. The debt securities \nmarket capitalization is estimated at $10.4 billion, which is 63% higher than in 2005. It is \ncharacterized  by  a  large  volume  of  consumer  price  index-linked  bonds  due  to  increasing \ninflation and an overall yield increase due to the rise in inflation and instruments supply. \n \n14.  Domestic pension funds have increasingly emerged as important investors in the local \nbond market since the launch of pension reform in 1998. The steadily accumulating pension \nfunds provide a supply of long-term funds that is lacking in most emerging markets, including \nmany other former Central Asian and Commonwealth of Independent States countries. In the \ncase of pension fund assets, these are heavily concentrated from a portfolio management \nperspective.  NBK  bills  and  corporate  bonds  account  for  34%  and  26%  of  total  assets; \nGovernment  bonds,  including  municipal  bonds,  account  for  19%  and  are  declining  as  the \nGovernment seeks to reduce its domestic burden. Investments into domestic equity are less \nthan 5% of total assets.3\n \n                                                 \n3  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 2004.

By late 2004, it had \ngrown to represent 31% of the $23 trillion United States bond market, with home mortgages \nrepresenting the majority of the securitized assets. Although securitization in Europe took longer \nto establish, securitization issuance increased from $50 billion to $500 billion between 1998 and \n2003. \n \n2.  Although securitization has gained wide acceptance in other parts of the world, it is still \nin its nascent stages in Asia. Issuance of asset-backed securities in the region has been \ndominated by Australia, Japan, and Republic of Korea, which account for around two thirds of \noverall issuance, followed by Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Singapore; and Taipei,China. A \nstrong argument can be made favoring the growth of asset securitization in countries with \ndeveloping capital markets. Many Asian countries are uniquely positioned to gain from the \nevolution of securitization in the region. \n \n3.  For Asian corporations, asset securitization provides a new and potentially cheaper form \nof financing. For loan originators such as banks, securitization is a means of removing assets \nfrom the balance sheet, while retaining most of the economic benefits associated with the \nassets and of freeing up capital to support further loan underwriting, while better matching \nassets and liabilities. For investors in Asia, including banks, unit trusts, and pension funds, the \nsecurities issued offer yields exceeding those on comparable corporate bonds, while providing \nan opportunity to diversify a fixed-income portfolio by adding another class of securities. \n \nA.  Background \n4.  Securitization is a form of financing that involves the pooling of financial assets and the \nissuance of securities that are repaid from the cash flows generated by these assets. This is \ngenerally accomplished by a true sale of the assets to a bankruptcy remote vehicle, which \nfinances the purchase through the issuance of bonds backed by the future cash flows of the \nasset pool. This achieves the outcome of creating a class of securities for which the underlying \nrisk is independent from that of the originating institution, and generally of a higher credit quality. \n \n5.  Asset-backed securitization is a highly structured financing technique that provides an \nentity with an economical means of financing without the added burden of increasing debt \nand/or equity. In its simplest form, securitization is a process whereby the revenue stream of a \nsegregated pool of receivables or other income-producing (mostly financial) assets owned by an \noriginal  lender  or  commercial  enterprise  (originator)  is  repackaged  into  tradable  securities \nissued to investors. The receivables are sold by the originator to a specially incorporated, off-\nbalance-sheet company or trust, known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). In return, the SPV \nwill generally pay a purchase amount equal to the (par or net present) value of the receivables, \nwith limited recourse or no recourse against the originator for nonperformance of the underlying \ndebtors.  \n6.  In  the  emerging  markets,  securitization  has  been  growing  quickly.  Initially,  most \ntransactions involved the securitization of future offshore cash flows derived from exports and \nremittances. Such structures, generally referred to as future flow transactions, are driven by the \nneed  for  borrowers  to  raise  relatively  cheap  cross-border  financing.  This  is  achieved  by \nmitigating  the  currency  transfer  risk  that  would  otherwise  be  present  in  their  corporate \nborrowings. More recently, as many developing countries have begun adopting the legal and \nregulatory reforms necessary for the domestic issuance of securitization, the bulk of activity has \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \nshifted to local markets. Although future flow transactions do play a role in local markets, the \nsecuritization of existing assets has seen the largest growth. \n \n7.  Securitization  is  most  appropriate  for  a  company  that  is  seeking  balance  sheet \nmanagement, or a company with a specific pool of assets that is better than its overall credit \nquality. In principle, any assets pool with predictable cash flows can be securitized, even those \nthat are nonperforming, as long as the timing and amount of recovery is predictable. The most \ncommon assets for securitization include mortgages, credit cards, auto and consumer loans, \ncorporate debt, export receivables, and offshore remittances. \n \nB.  Structure \n \n8.  At the center of a securitization is an SPV set up by the originator of the financial assets \nto be securitized. The SPV purchases the financial asset receivables (e.g., mortgages, small- \nand medium-sized enterprise loans) from the originator. The SPV will be structured to control its \nincome and expenses so that it will be \u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d1 The SPV will fund the purchase of \nthe receivables through the issue of debt securities to investors, which will be secured on the \nreceivables by virtue of a security interest granted to a security trustee acting for the investors \nand other creditors. The originator (or an associated company) may continue to act as the \nservicer in collecting and administering the receivables as an agent of the SPV, which in turn \nwill apply the income from the receivables to make payment of principal and interest under the \ndebt securities as well as transaction expenses. A standby servicer may also be arranged in \ncase the originator fails to perform its servicing obligations. Funds received by the SPV in \nexcess of those required to pay investors are generally channeled back to the originator. Thus, \nsecuritization enables nontradable assets that range in marketability, creditworthiness, and size \nto become liquid secondary instruments through repackaging and cash-flow structuring.  \n9.  To obtain the lowest all-in cost of financing for the asset originator, the risk inherent in \nthe asset pool is often structured to create two or more layers of risk. These layers are often \nreferred to as tranches. Typically, the expected loss on the portfolio is identified and placed in a \njunior (also referred to as equity) tranche that is retained by the originator. Requiring the \noriginator  to  fully  absorb  the  initial  losses  helps  to  mitigate  the  moral  hazard  that  would \notherwise be present if one entity was to originate the portfolio, but not have a stake in its \neventual performance. \n \n10.  The next tranche of risk is often referred to as mezzanine, which is generally structured \nto  absorb  losses  that  are  not  necessarily  expected,  but  that  may  reasonably  occur  if \nperformance  of  the  portfolio  is  much  worse  than  anticipated.  With  the  proper  amount  of \nsubordination, derived from the junior and mezzanine tranches, a highly rated senior tranche \ncan then be structured that is generally deemed to comprise relatively little risk. If adequately \nstructured,  this  senior  tranche  achieves  a  risk-reward  combination  sufficient  to  attract \ninstitutional investors. \n \n11.  Various forms of credit and liquidity enhancement will be used and structured into the \ntransaction cash flow to ensure that payments on the debt securities issued to the investors are \n                                                 \n1  A key concern in securitization transactions is to ensure that the transfer of assets of the originator to the SPV is \nnot affected by bankruptcy or distress of the originator. This necessitates certain legal precautions in structuring the \nassignment of receivables, and also constituting the SPV that it can neither be taken to liquidation by the \nshareholders of the originator, nor by those of the SPV itself. Further, the structure should also ensure that the SPV \nwould not be treated as the subset of the originator by substantive consolidation. Such a structure is called a \nbankruptcy remote structure. ", "  Appendix 3  23\nmade in full and on a timely basis. Consequently, the recourse of the investors is usually limited \nto (i) receivables, (ii) transaction cash flow, and (iii) credit enhancement incorporated in the \nsecuritization structure. A high credit rating (usually higher than that of the originator) on the \ndebt securities and therefore cheaper funding can be obtained by reason of the quality of the \nreceivables, the isolation of the receivables from the other risks of the originator\u2019s business (by \narranging a \u201ctrue\u201d sale of the receivables from the originator to the SPV), and the arrangements \nfor credit enhancement and liquidity support.  \n \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nBENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION1\nA.  How Originators Benefit \n1.  Originators (the selling bank) gain from securitization by obtaining many of the benefits \nof high-credit quality financing without retaining the debt on their books and without forgoing \nprofitable aspects of the assets, including origination, servicing, expansion of business, and \nretention of excess spread. The technique for determining the price paid can be complex and \nmay require a significant initial investment of managerial and financial resources. Some relevant \nadvantages include the following: \n \n(i)  Assets  removed  from  the  balance  sheet.  If  structured  as  a  true  sale, \nsecuritization can allow the originator to reduce its assets and debt, thereby \nincreasing its scope for borrowing. Securitization allows a bank or business to \nachieve greater leverage. \n \n(ii)  Lower financing costs. Well-regarded pools of assets owned by a company or \nbank can be used to structure a security of higher credit quality, and therefore, of \nlower market cost than the corporate entity could issue itself. \n \n(iii)  Reduction  in  required  capital.  For  a  bank  or  finance  company  that  faces \nregulatory capital requirements, a securitization transaction that qualifies as a \nsale  of  assets  for  bank  regulatory  purposes  reduces  the  need  for  equity \nfinancing. The latter may be costly and hard to obtain, and may dilute control. \n \n(iv)  Recognition  of  gains  (or  losses).  Depending  on  accounting  rules,  a \nsecuritization structured as a sale of assets may allow a seller to recognize an \naccounting gain (or loss) equal in the aggregate to the present value of any \nexpected future cash flows payable to the seller that will be derived from the \nassets. \n \n(v)  Access to an alternative source of finance and class of investors. \n \nB.  How Investors Benefit  \n2.  Asset-backed securities are not suitable for all investors: they are more complex, and \nmay be less liquid than other debt securities. Nevertheless, many investors find that asset-\nbacked securities open up attractive new investment opportunities for the following reasons: \n(i)  Superior return. The main benefit from the investor's viewpoint is a higher return \nor spread than is generally available on corporate or sovereign debt of a similar \nrating. \n(ii)  Liquidity.  The  securitization  structure  offers  far  greater  liquidity  than  the \nindividual loans backing the transaction. \n(iii)  Diversification.  Investors  gain  an  opportunity  to  diversify  their  portfolios  by \nparticipating in a different class of assets. \n(iv)  Mitigation  of  event  risk.  Unlike  similar,  high-rated  corporate  bonds,  asset-\nbacked securities are largely immune from event risk. The latter results from \n                                                 \n1  Based on Giddy, Ian H. 2000. Asset Securitization in Asia. New York: New York University.

Many  institutional  investors  are  constrained  to \npurchase  only  investment  grade  securities,  and  some  are  limited  to  triple-A \npaper. Both requirements can be met in the securitization market.  \n \nC.  How the National Economy Benefits \n3.  The effect of securitization on the economies of different countries is still difficult to \nassess because the technique is in its infancy in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, in \ncountries  such  as  Australia,  Canada,  United  Kingdom,  and  United  States,  where  a  high \nproportion of residential mortgages and other claims have been securitized, the gains to the \nnational economy can be measured in the billions of dollars. In the United States alone, for \nexample, at least $1,600 billion of mortgage- and asset-backed securities are outstanding. \nAccording to a conservative estimate, securitization in the United States reduces the annual \ncost ($1,600 billion) of financing for homeowners and others by 0.5%, freeing up $8 billion of \nresources each year.  \n \n4.  But the case for securitization is actually even stronger than this. Asset securitization, if \nintroduced in a transparent and orderly fashion, offers Asian countries additional gains from \n \n(i)  capital market development, as more high-quality securities are added to the \nfixed-income market; \n(ii)  a  source  of  funds  for  rapidly  growing,  capital-constrained  banks,  finance \ncompanies,  and  industrial  companies  whose  expansion  depends  on  the \nextension of credit to their customers; \n(iii)  an expanded source of financing for residential home ownership and other asset \nclasses; and \n(iv)  the potential for financing infrastructure projects and other assets that produce \nreliable revenue streams capable of being contractually assigned to a separate \nlegal entity. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 5 \nTHE MECHANICS OF FUTURE FLOW SECURITIZATION  \n1.  The types of assets securitized by future flow securitizations have varied over the years. \nThe most common flow being securitized previously stemmed from export receivables. Over the \npast 15 years and through 2005, approximately $54.2 billion in future flow export receivables \ntransactions have occurred. Since 2002, financial remittances have become the most popular \nfuture  flow  asset  class,  with  $13.2  billion  of  remittances/diversified  payment  rights  (DPR) \nsecuritizations.  \n \n2.  The first major securitization deal involving migrant remittances occurred in 1994 in \nMexico. During 2000\u20132004, a total of $10.4 billion was raised through DPR securitization by \nBrazil, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Turkey.1 2005 was the highest issuance year with close to \n$10 billion in total volume.2\n \nA.  Historical Volume Development \n \n3.  Latin America has traditionally been the strongest originator of future flow receivables. \nIssuers such as Mexico\u2019s Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex), which in 1996 placed $6.0 billion, and \nVenezuela\u2019s PDVSA Finance Ltd., placing $3.4 billion, have enhanced Latin America\u2019s volume \nover the years. Until 2001, Mexico had always been the dominating country for future flow \nissuance. Prior to the upsurge in volume in Turkey in 2005, Brazil had taken over as the primary \nsource for future flow paper. This is mainly due to the countries\u2019 sovereign ratings. Mexican \nissuers, because they are domiciled in an investment-grade country, are less in need of the \nstructural protections provided by future flow. Brazil (and Turkey in 2005) on the other hand, \nwhich has been rated between B and BB since 2001, is a market where future flow is useful in \nmitigating sovereign-related risks and opens access to international capital markets for strong \ncompanies.  \n \n4.  While  Mexico,  Brazil,  and  Turkey  could  be  considered  the  historical  leaders,  other \ncountries have also had significant amounts of issuance. Argentina has produced more than \n$3.5 billion, although amounts have been limited since the 2001 financial crisis. Top banks from \nvarious Central American countries issued financial remittance future flows. Recently, Indonesia \nreturned  to  the  future  flow  market  with  $600  million  securitization of  coal  exports.  Finally, \nEastern Europe and the Russian Federation have shown significant potential as strong future \nflow candidates. \n \nB.  Transaction Mechanics \n \n5.  A future flow transaction securitizes the cash flow originating from a specific business \nline of a bank or company that produces goods or services for foreign customers. The structure \nof the future flow transaction is designed to collect cash flows in a dedicated offshore collection \naccount. The cash flows come from a variety of sources, including foreign importers making \npayments on receivables, international credit card companies making settlement payments to \nlocal banks, and international banks making remittance transfers to local banks. All cash flows \npass  through  the  offshore  collection  account,  and  the  excess  flows  are  returned  to  the \noriginating entity only after periodic debt-service payments are made.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Dilip Ratha Senior Economist and Lead Author of Global Economic Prospects 2006: Economic Implications of \nRemittances and Migration, World Bank, Washington D.C. 18 November 2005. \n2  Fitch Ratings. Future Flow Securitization Rating Methodology. 15 February 2006. ", "  Appendix 5  27\n6.  The transaction\u2019s structure mitigates many sovereign risks by keeping the cash flow \noffshore until the investors are paid. If certain events occur (trigger events), the structures \ntypically trap all cash flows going through the collection account to accelerate amortization of \nthe notes. In some cases, only a portion of excess flows are captured during early amortization \nevents in order to avert a liquidity crisis for an issuer. Ratings of future flow transactions are tied \nto the credit quality of the originator, which is typically measured by its local currency issuer \ndefault rating.  \n \n7.  In some cases, a transaction\u2019s issuer default rating may be higher than the company\u2019s \nlocal currency issuer default rating because of the company\u2019s ability to continue operating \nbeyond a general default and generate receivables for the duration of the deal. The going \nconcern assessment (Fitch methodology) and survivability assessment (Moody\u2019s) address these \nissues. Achieving a rating at this level is a twofold concept. The company  must not only \ncontinue  to  generate  these  receivables  by  producing  and  delivering  the  product,  but  the \ncollections from the receivables must also be legally protected through a true sale structure. In \nsome cases, transactions are rated above the issuing company\u2019s local currency issuer default \nrating but below the going concern/survivability level.  \n \n \nFigure A5: Typical Future Flow Transaction Structure \n \nReceivables \nPayment \n  Obligors  Trust \n \nPrincipal and \n  Interest \nFuture  Future \nProdu ct  Receivables \nInvestors \nCollections over \nPrincipal and \n \nInterest  Offshore \n  Local Country \nOriginator \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank analysis. \n \n \nC.  Future Flow Asset Classes \n8.  The two general types of future flow securitizations are (i) financial future flows backed \nby banks\u2019 generation of hard currency flows, and (ii) corporate-related transactions typically \ninvolving export receipts of some description. Financial flows include credit card vouchers, and \nelectronic (typically SWIFT-related payments,3 including MT100s and MT200s4) and paper \n                                                 \n3  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is an international messaging system \nowned and maintained by the member banks (payment order only, no settlement). MT103/103+ are sent by the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction. \n ", "28  Appendix 5 \nremittances. Corporate-related transactions typically involve airline ticket receivables; telephone \nnet settlements; and the most prevalent, export receivables transactions, which are backed by \nproducts such as oil, gas, steel, iron ore, soybean, paper and pulp, aluminum, coffee, and \nchemicals.  \n9.  A  bank  or  company  based  in  an  emerging  market  securitizes  existing  and  future \nreceivables related to offshore cash flows (usually in a stable foreign currency) and receives the \nproceeds of the debt issuance denominated in the same currency. The cash flows originate \nfrom a specific line of business in which the bank/company has demonstrated consistent strong \nperformance and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, or at least for the life of the \nstructured deal. In the majority of structures, the bank/company sells its rights to the future flow \nto an offshore special purpose vehicle, which transfers its rights to an offshore trust. The trust \nissues debt securities backed by future cash flows, and remits the sale proceeds to the special \npurpose vehicle, which in turn passes them back to the originating bank/company.  \n10.  Because note holders have access to payments on the receivables before they return to \nthe country in which the issuer is located, they are not believed to be directly subject to \nconvertibility  and  transfer  risks.  Thus,  the  ratings  of  these  transactions  are  not  strictly \nconstrained by the foreign currency rating of the host country (the sovereign ceiling). However, \nall sovereign risks are not mitigated by the structure, and transaction ratings are still constrained \nby certain inherent political and economic risks of an emerging-market country. These risks can \narise from such events as government instability, civil unrest, or natural disaster. \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n4  MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through banks. MT200 \n(including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders to payees \nthat are financial institutions. \n ", "  Appendix 6  29\nFUTURE FLOW SECURITIZATION VOLUMES \n \n \n \nFigure A6.1: Emerging Market Future Flow Issuance by Country/Region \n \nPeru, 778\nRussia and Eastern \nAfrica, 1,900\nEurope, 1,775\nTurkey, 11,149\nMexico, 18,377\nVenezuela, 3,349\nAsia, 4,926\nColombia, 1,492\nCentral America, \nChile, 200\n2,020\nCarribean, 432 Brazil, 11,628\nArgentina, 3,560\n \nSource: Fitch.

The bank that wishes to raise funds sells its rights to all present and future diversified \npayment rights (DPR) to an offshore special purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV transfers its rights \nto the cash flows to an offshore trust, and then issues debt securities (notes) backed by the \nfuture cash flows. The sale proceeds from the notes are then transferred from the SPV to the \noriginating bank.  \n \n2.  The cash flows sold are typically only those payments received from correspondent \nbanks  located  in  highly  rated  countries  such  as  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The \ncorrespondent banks sign a notice and acknowledgment that commits them to sending all future \nreceivables to a trust account held by the SPV. This cash flow is then used to make scheduled \nprincipal and interest payments to the investors; any excess cash is returned to the originator. \n \n3.  DPR securitization is recognized as an alternative source of long-term capital for banks. \nThe cost of funds is attractive compared to unsecured bonds. The notes usually receive a rating \nhigher than the host country\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating since (i) the future receivables \nare due from offshore obligors; and (ii) the repayment is made directly by the SPV, which again \nis located offshore, to the investor. The investment grade rating makes these transactions \nattractive to a wider range of investors such as insurance companies that face limitations on \nbuying subinvestment grade. The sold receivables also form part of the assets of the SPV and \ntherefore, are not subject to claim of any other creditor in the event of bankruptcy. \n ", "  Appendix 8  31\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\u2019S EFFORTS ON REMITTANCES \n \n1.  The director general of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) initiated efforts with regard to remittances in 2004 by hiring a staff \nconsultant to research the topic of remittances and help craft a strategy for ADB\u2019s involvement \nin this arena. Remittance initiatives in 2004 included organizing ADB\u2019s cosponsorship of an \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Tokyo, and undertaking the first large-scale \nsurvey of remittances conducted at ADB. This research effort, which studied the Philippines \n(one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  receivers  of  remittances),1  was  well  received.  In  2005,  ADB \nparticipated in a related survey, this time a regional survey of remittances within Asian countries, \nand organized a major conference on remittances attracting more than 30 speakers and 350 \nparticipants. During 2005 and 2006, PSOD represented ADB on a global task force organized \nby the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements, which developed global principles for \nremittances that will be finalized in September 2006. This effort indicates that remittances have \nbecome a focus of development agencies in general, and ADB participation demonstrates \nADB\u2019s commitment. \n \nA.  Context of Remittances at ADB \n \n2.  Remittances\u2014the  financial  aspect  of  migration\u2014are  a  matter  of  increasing  national \ninterest for both developed and developing countries. Global remittances in 2005 are estimated \nat $225 billion, and as such represent the second largest flow of external finance after foreign \ndirect investment, and are twice as large as flows of formal development assistance.   \n \n3.  Remittances have significant importance for development and poverty reduction. In the \nabsence of an efficient domestic labor market and a social insurance system, remittances are a \nkey  means  for  individuals  to  address  poverty.  In  Tajikistan,  for  example,  the  poverty  rate \ndeclined from 81% to 60% during 2000\u20132003, largely, according to the International Monetary \nFund, as a result of remittance flows. Remittances fuel both consumption and growth; indeed, \ngross national disposable income was at least 15% higher than gross domestic product per \ncapita in Tajikistan in 2004 with the difference attributed to out-of-country remittances.  \n \n4.  Remittances also contribute to financing a country\u2019s trade deficit and have a positive \nimpact on national current accounts; imports paid for with remittances increase government \nrevenues in customs duties and value-added tax. Remittances are more consistent than other \nflows and are countercyclical, which helps to balance economic fluctuations caused by changes \nin  exports,  imports,  or  politics;  and  thus  contributes  to  foreign  exchange  rate  stability. \nRemittances also help strengthen the banking system and support expanded credit to the \nprivate sector by increasing the deposit base to support increased lending.   \n \nB.  Remittances in Central Asia \n \n  1.  Overview \n \n5.  PSOD\u2019s most recent involvement in remittances has been a contribution of $300,000 to \nthe total project cost of $1,300,000 for a remittance survey in five Central Asian countries, run \nby  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  which  will  study  both  the  relationship  of \nremittances to poverty and social conditions, and the relationship between remittances and the \nfinancial sector (both formal and informal). The countries covered by the survey will be Armenia, \n                                                 \n1  Estimated at $12 billion in 2006. \n ", "32  Appendix 8 \nAzerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan (all receiving countries), and Kazakhstan (sending \ncountry). Remittances are a major economic factor for receiving countries.2\n \nTable A8: Remittances in Central Asia \n    \n  Remittance GDP  Population \nCountry  ($ million)  ($ billion)  (million) \nArmenia  1,000  4.8  3.2 \nAzerbaijan  1,000  12.8  8.3 \nKyrgyz Republic     750  2.4  5.1 \nTajikistan  1,000  2.3  6.5 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Remittances can be considered as particularly important to the health and strength of \nCentral Asian economies. The sudden collapse of the Soviet Union left these countries and \ngovernments in economic and social disarray, a condition that persists in many parts of the \nregion.  The  flow  of  remittances  has  significantly  contributed  to  improved  conditions  in  the \nreceiving countries, and supplied necessary labor inputs to migrant recipient economies.  \n \n7.  Lacking  in  national  advantages  such  as  natural  resources  and  large  domestic \neconomies that characterize some of their Asian neighbors, most of the Central Asian republic \nreceiving countries are small and impoverished, and the flow of remittances is particularly \ncritical to their stability and growth. Indeed, with high unemployment rates despite a high degree \nof literacy and education, many of these receiving countries rely disproportionately on labor as \nan  exportable  resource,  and  on  the  remittances  derived  from  this  resource.  Similarly, \nKazakhstan and the Russian Federation as migrant destination countries have labor shortages \nand would not realize their current economic growth without the infusion of migrant labor. \n \n  2.  Remittances in Kazakhstan \n \n8.  In  the  case  of  Kazakhstan,  workers\u2019  remittances  and  compensation  for  employees \nreceived was $122 million in 2000, $148 million in 2003, and $167 million in 2004.3 Along with \nthe Russian Federation, Kazakhstan has become a major migrant receiving country among the \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)4 in recent years, having lost 20% of its population \ndue  to  mass  emigration  of  Slavic  people,  Germans,  and  Jews  in  the  1990s.  The  initial \nemigration of Kazakhstan nationals to more developed western countries contributes to the \ncountry\u2019s inward remittances. Every 10th family in Kazakhstan reportedly depends on migration-\nrelated earnings and remittances of their relatives.5 On the other hand, the entry of other CIS \nnationals into Kazakhstan resulted in Kazakhstan being identified as one of the sources of \nremittances among the CIS.  \n \n                                                 \n2  The total global flows might be up to 50% higher if unrecorded remittances are included; the informal flows to the \nCommonwealth of Independent States countries are unlikely to be any different, so these numbers probably \nunderstate the full picture significantly. Although not covered by this survey, the Russian Federation is the largest \nsource of remittances to the targeted countries, with a total outflow of more than $5.5 billion compared with inflows \nof some $2.7 billion.   \n3  World Bank.  \n4  The CIS member states are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, \nRussian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. \n5  Global Commission on International Migration.
