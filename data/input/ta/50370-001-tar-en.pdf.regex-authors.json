INTRODUCTION \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enhance the sustainable \ntransport operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in developing member countries \n(DMCs) through support for project preparation, implementation, and capacity development to \nADB\u2019s operations departments (ODs) and DMCs.1  \n \n2.  This TA is needed to successfully implement the Midterm Review of the Sustainable \nTransport Initiative Operational Plan (STI-OP)2 and was included in the 2017 Work Plan of the \nTransport Sector Group (TSG).3 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020,4 and its initial proposal for Strategy 2030, ADB\u2019s high-level technology initiative, the global \nsustainable transport agenda, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Besides its beneficial contributions, transport can have negative social, environmental, \nand economic effects that need to be avoided or mitigated.6 DMCs need assistance to develop \nsustainable  transport  systems.  STI-OP  defined  sustainable  transport  as  transport  that  is \naccessible,  affordable,  environment-friendly,  and  safe.  However,  many  DMCs  have  limited \nexperience developing sustainable transport solutions and need assistance from ADB to scale \nup their investments and develop more suitable institutional arrangements to support their \nambitions. \n \n4.  In 2010, ADB approved the STI-OP to establish an ADB-wide approach to its transport \noperations to better serve the changing needs of DMCs. The plan emphasized the need to \nmainstream sustainability in ADB's road operations (road asset management, road safety), and \nbuild up operations in (i) urban transport, (ii) addressing climate change in transport, (iii) cross-\nborder  transport  and  logistics,  and  (iv)  social  sustainability.  It  set  aspirational  targets  for \ntransport lending that were incorporated into ADB's corporate results framework. In 2016, the \nMidterm Review of the STI-OP (footnote 2) examined progress of its implementation concluding \nthat ADB had significantly adjusted the overall subsector composition of its transport portfolio: \nlending for roads declined from 79% in 2000\u25002009 to 67% in 2010\u25002016, for urban transport \nincreased from 2% in 2000\u25002009 to 15% in 2010\u25002016, and transport lending became more \ndiverse (such as lending for policy reform, water transport, and multimodal logistics). Taking into \naccount  the  subsector  lending  trends  and  the  limited  scope  for  ODs  to  make  significant \nadjustments to the pipeline during given time horizon, the targets for ADB\u2019s assistance for \nsustainable transport as set out in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 were revised. Setting \ntargets that are ambitious and at the same time realistic, the Midterm Review of the STI-OP \nestablished the revised 2020 lending targets to 52% for roads, 20% for urban transport, and  \n18% for railways. \n \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 September 2017.  \n2   ADB. 2017.

In  2011,  ADB  approved  a  $9.3  million  cluster  TA  (Implementation  of  Sustainable \nTransport in Asia and the Pacific) to support the implementation of the STI-OP.7 The cluster TA \nfocused mainly on conducting studies on greenhouse gas assessment methodologies, low \ncarbon transport, nonmotorized transport, data on sustainable transport, and intelligent transport \nsystems (ITS). The cluster TA helped to develop ADB\u2019s strategy to implement the STI-OP by \nconducting initial sector positioning studies for urban transport and supporting knowledge work, \nbut provided limited resources for strategic operational support to operations departments. The \ncluster TA was completed in December 2016 with the recommendation that new regional TA \nprojects should (i) continue to support the implementation of the Midterm Review of STI-OP, (ii) \nshould have a clear focus on supporting operations departments in scaling up sustainable \ntransport,  and  (iii)  should  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  consultation  with  operations \ndepartments and other sector and thematic groups. \n \n6.  To enhance strategic operational support and provide upstream support to operations \ndepartments, in 2015, ADB approved a $5 million regional research and development TA for \nunlocking innovation for development. This Innovation TA committed $1.5 million to help scale-\nup urban transport and road safety operations in DMCs.8 The original completion date of the TA \nis December 2019 but due to high demand for support from operations departments, TSG \nexpects activities will be completed by 2018. The resources from this proposed TA will enable \nTSG to  seamlessly  continue  supporting  urban transport  and  road  safety  in  the  operations \ndepartments.  \n \n7.  The Midterm Review of the STI-OP found that scaling up sustainable transport and the \nlending targets were not fully achieved due to (i) limited resources for upstream dialogue for the \npromotion of sustainable transport initiatives within ADB DMCs, (ii) limited resources available \nfor  effective  project  quality  assurance  (such  as  road  safety  audits,  traffic  studies,  and \ngreenhouse  gas  emission  impact  estimates),  and  (iii)  limited  financing  facilities  to  support \nproject preparation and design. The approved Midterm Review of the STI-OP included this \nproposed new regional TA as one of its key recommendations. This TA will enable ADB\u2019s TSG \nto help the operations departments scale up sustainable transport as envisaged in the Midterm \nReview of the STI-OP and ensure resources are available to provide effective quality assurance \nand support to operations departments, promote knowledge sharing on sustainable transport in \nDMCs and within ADB, and continue to implement the STI-OP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  TA  will  be  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  improved  mobility,  economic, \nenvironmental, and health conditions in participating DMCs (footnote 2). The TA will have the \nfollowing  outcome:  ADB\u2019s  sustainable  transport  operations  in  DMCs  increased. 9\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011. Implementation of Sustainable Transport in Asia and the Pacific. Manila (C-R-CDTA 009). The cluster \nTA included activities such as the development of a tool for transportation emissions evaluation model for projects, \nthe development and roll-out of the sustainable transport appraisal rating framework, the support the development \nof the intelligent transport system (ITS) components for the Ulaanbaatar bus rapid transit system, or pilot projects \nand concepts to support ADB\u2019s operations in at least 18 cities (including Baku, Karachi, and Manila). \n8  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Unlocking Innovation for Development. Manila (TA 9017-REG). Consulting   \nservices for this TA have been arranged with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and   \nthe International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP). \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  The  proposed  TA  will  support  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  projects  and \ncapacity development of DMCs in STI-OP priority subsectors, will identify potential projects and \nother activities appropriate for high level technology solutions, and will deliver the following \noutputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Sustainable transport initiatives in developing member countries \ndeveloped  and  implemented.  The  TA  will  promote  the  development, \npreparation,  and  implementation  of  more  high-quality  sustainable  transport \nprojects through direct, timely support to the operations departments. Building \nupon the prior regional research and development TA, it will provide operations \ndepartments\u2019  project  teams  access  to  additional  resources,  expertise,  and \ntechnical  support  for  dialogue  with  DMCs10 to  develop  project  pipelines  of \nsustainable transport projects including the application of high level technology.11 \n(ii)  Output  2:  Knowledge  and  capacity  of  developing  member  countries  in \nsustainable transport improved. The TA will promote knowledge sharing and \ninstitutional capacity building in sustainable transport both within ADB and with \nDMC partners. The TA will provide the resources needed to improve knowledge \nsharing  and  institutional  capacity  development  activities,  including  the  2018 \nTransport Forum and training programs focused on sustainable transport priority \nareas,  including  railway  infrastructure  asset  management,  and  road  asset \nmanagement and safety. 12  The TA will also support consultations to establish \nthe proposed sustainable transport financing partnership facility, building upon \nthe ongoing work under the TA project on Delivering Knowledge Solutions in Asia \nand the Pacific.13 \n \n10.  The TSG will continue to liaise with operations departments to ensure that the support \nand  resources  available from  this TA  and the  means to  access  those  resources  are  well \nunderstood in the operations departments. This TA was developed in consultation with the \nsector committee and advisory teams14 of the TSG and with transport project officers in one-on-\none meetings to assess the needs of the operations departments and the likely areas that will \nneed  additional  support.15 The  TA  will  seamlessly  continue  the  highly  successful  support \nactivities that were initiated with the innovation and cluster TA projects. The TA activities will be \ndefined according to the priorities and needs for sustainable transport in DMCs and using cross-\nsector consultation with the sector and thematic groups (e.g., transport, urban, energy, climate \nchange, and environment) within ADB. \n                                                \n10  For example, by recruiting experts that join mission or project teams and funding initial project scoping, data \ncollection, and feasibility studies in STI-OP priority areas. \n11   Such as in technologies for transport management and operation (traffic, public transport) or ticketing systems. \n12   ADB\u2019s Transport Forum has grown into one of the region\u2019s premier sustainable transport events for exchange of  \nknowledge and good practices among DMCs, development partners, and other stakeholders. \n13   ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Delivering Knowledge Solutions in Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA 9024- \nREG). The TSG obtained a funding allocation of $200,000 to identify potential donors and develop preliminary \nconsultations regarding the establishment of the financing partnership facility. \n14   These cover roads and road safety, urban transport, railways, water and air transport, social sustainability, climate  \nchange and environment, economic analysis, cross-border transport and logistics, and ITS (being established). \n15   The areas that have been preliminarily identified to receive TA support are (i) road asset management and safety \nin Central and West Asia, including the Pakistan Road Assessment Program; (ii) urban transport, supporting the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  sustainable  urban  transport  projects  in  Manila  (Philippines),  Melaka \n(Malaysia),  Suva  (Fiji),  and  medium-sized  cities  in  Indonesia;  and  (iii)  ITS  for  implementation  of  traffic \nmanagement in Kazakhstan. Other relevant areas will also be considered during project implementation.  \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which $514,500 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6), $390,900 by TASF-other sources, \nand $594,600 (equivalent to \u20ac500,000) by the Government of Austria and administered by \nADB.16 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. Additional funding sources, including \ncontributions from development partners are being explored, subject to TA implementation \nprogress. The scope and implementation period of the TA may be extended to reflect any \nadditional financing, subject to fund availability. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. The TSG Secretariat under \nthe Sector Advisory Service Cluster of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment will implement the TA and be accountable for the outputs. It will carry out TA \nadministration and supervision, implementation oversight, and communication with consultants \nand  stakeholders  in  close  coordination  with  operations  departments  and  other  sector  and \nthematic groups. \n \n13.  The proposed implementation arrangements are consistent with the Midterm Review of \nthe  STI-OP  and  will  enable  the  TSG  to  provide  high-quality  services  that  can  be  quickly \nmobilized when needed at the request of operations departments for projects related to railways, \nurban transport, cross-border transport and logistics, road asset management and safety, water \ntransport,  aviation,  large-scale  structures  (bridges  and  tunnels),  climate  change,  and  ITS. \nDuring the TA implementation, the Sector Advisory Service Cluster will also conduct outreach to \noperations departments to notify them of the resources available on request.   \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2017\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB  \nTransport Sector Group Secretariat under the Sector Advisory Service \nImplementing agency \nCluster, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, ADB \nTo be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: Single Source \n16 person-months  $300,000 \nSelection \nConsultants  Individual international \n21 person-months  $480,000 \nconsultants \nIndividual national \n20 person-months  $43,850 \nconsultants \nTo be procured by ADB and/or consultant \nProcurement \nShopping  5 contracts  $50,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  When the TA is completed, ADB and/or consultant will promptly turnover any \narrangement upon TA completion  purchased equipment to the government or dispose of these.
