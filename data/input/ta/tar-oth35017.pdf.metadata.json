INTRODUCTION\n1. In early 1997 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) initiated a program (the Program) for\nregional economic cooperation among its member countries in the Central Asia region, including\nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Tajikistan joined the Program after it became an ADB\nmember in 1998.1 The Program has followed a phased approach.2 Phase I was implemented\nduring  1997-1998  when  the  focus  was  on  raising  the  awareness  of  the  participating\ngovernments in the importance, and deepening the understanding of the potential of regional\neconomic cooperation. This was achieved mainly through a series of workshops, seminars and\nin-depth studies. Phase II, which began in 1999, emphasizes the identification and preparation\nof priority regional projects for implementation. During the first two years of Phase II, significant\nprogress  has  been  made  in  this  direction  especially  in  the  transport  and  energy  sectors.\nHowever, given the evolving nature of the Program and new developments in the region, Phase\nII\u2014Year Three is needed to address top regional concerns, including trade and investment\nfacilitation and the broad water/energy/environment issues. The participating governments have\nindicated their full support for Phase II\u2014Year Three.3 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\nA.  ADB-supported Regional Economic Cooperation Program in Central Asia\n2. After gaining independence in 1991, the former Soviet republics in Central Asia faced\nthe twin challenge of nationhood building and transition to a market-based economy. These\ntasks  were  made  particularly  formidable  by  a  number  of  specific  regional  economic  and\ngeographical factors. These include the land-locked location and remoteness from major world\nmarkets,  small  domestic  markets,  and  complementary  resource  endowments  especially  in\nenergy. These key regional factors combine to suggest that developing regional markets would\nsave large transport costs, exploit scale economies, and yield gains from trade, including those\nbased on resource complementarity. Developing regional markets to realize such gains and\nraise the living standards of the people requires joint action of the countries in the region. This is\nthe fundamental rationale for economic cooperation in the Central Asia region.\n3. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang, PRC) is the western-most territory of the\nPRC, bordering the Central Asian republics (CARs). While the development path it has followed\nin the past decade differs from that of the CARs, it faces similar key regional factors as the\nCARs, and thus has similar needs for economic cooperation.\n4. The overall objective of the Program in the Central Asia region is to promote economic\ngrowth and raise living standards through economic cooperation. The Program focuses on\nsupporting the development of regional markets by tackling key regional factors as discussed\nabove. Its operational strategy is to finance large infrastructure needs and improve the policy\nenvironment for promoting cross-border trade and traffic in energy, trade, and transportation.\n                  \n1 Azerbaijan, which became an ADB member in 1999, is expected to be admitted in the Program by end 2001.\nTurkmenistan joined ADB in 2000 and is presently in consultation with ADB on participating in the Program.\n2 The phased approach is suggested in the ADB policy paper, R60-94, Bank Support for Regional Cooperation, 11\nApril. The program of regional economic cooperation in Central Asia has been supported by TA 5707: Regional\nEconomic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $1,150,000 approved on 8 November 1996; TA 5760: Workshops on\nEconomic Cooperation in Central Asia, for $344,000 approved on 14 November 1997; TA 5818: Regional\nEconomic Cooperation in Central Asia, Phase II, 1,350,000 approved on 11 December 1998; and TA 5942:\nRegional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia, Phase II\u2014Year Two, for $420,000 approved on 2 October 2000.\n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2001.", "2\nThis reflects three underlying strategic concerns to (i) lessen the economic isolation of the\nregion  through  improvements  in  transport  systems;  (ii)  maximize  benefits  from  resource\ncomplementarities  through  rationalizing  and  encouraging  regional  energy  trade  based  on\nmarket principles; and (iii) ensure an underlying policy environment favorable to trade and\ntraffic.\n5. With its focus on project financing and related policy improvement, the Program has\nbegun to bear concrete results. In October 2000 ADB's Board of Directors approved a loan for\nthe Almaty-Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project, while mobilizing additional financing\nof $26 million through cofinancing.4 A feasibility study is in progress on an investment project for\nimproving the Central Asia power transmission system.5\n6. By addressing key regional factors in a pragmatic and results-oriented manner, the\nProgram has received strong support and close cooperation from all participating governments.\nAt the Conference on Central Asian Regional Cooperation in Transportation in Almaty in 2000,\nthis approach was validated by the governments, which reiterated support for ADB\u2019s important\nrole in financing infrastructure projects. The Conference also endorsed establishing project\nspecific working groups as an effective mechanism for implementing priority regional transport\nprojects. This is an important step towards implementation. One key lesson learned during\nPhase II is that regional economic cooperation in Central Asia is particularly resource intensive\nand requires careful preparation and consensus building, and meticulous implementation.\nB.  Phase II\u2014Year Three\n7. Almost  10  years  after  the  transition  began  and  over  five  years  after  the  CARs\u2019\neconomies bottomed out, raising living standards through sustainable economic growth remains\nthe single most important challenge for all the CARs. On the other hand, notwithstanding rapid\neconomic progress during the past decade, Xinjiang, PRC remains one of the PRC\u2019s poorest\nregions. As the factors discussed above continue to pose as long-term development obstacles\nand challenges, supporting priority regional infrastructure projects in transport and energy, and\nimproving the related policy environment to assist the development of regional markets will\nremain a focus of the Program.\n8. While the overall objective of the Program remains valid, there have been a number of\nsignificant recent regional developments in Central Asia that have posed new challenges. First,\ndespite  past  progress,  barriers,  especially  non-tariff  barriers  continue  to  hamper  the\ndevelopment of regional markets. The recent worsening of the regional security situation has\nadded uncertainty to the general trade and investment environment that is still recovering from\nthe aftermath of the Russian crisis of 1998. The ineffectiveness of customs and the lack of\ncooperation among them have been generally recognized as a top constraint to expanding trade\nand  investment  in  the  region.  Other  legal,  regulatory,  and  administrative  difficulties  have\nprevented private sector investment from playing a major role in generating economic growth.\n9. Second,  although  resource  endowments  in  energy  and  water  are  complementary\nespecially among the CARs, satisfactory solutions leading to the rational use and trade of\nresources are yet to be found. The link between water and energy are both intricate and highly\n                  \n4 Loan 1774-KAZ: Almaty-Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project, for $65,000,000, approved on 31 October\n2000.

This also has far-reaching effect on the environment, as demonstrated by\nthe disaster of the Aral Sea in the not too distant past.  The severe drought last year affected\nthe livelihood of millions of people and caused havoc to agriculture and industries in the region.\nThis  has  brought  to  the  fore  the  urgency  of  resolving  the  broad  regional\nwater/energy/environment issues.\n10. Third,  as  ADB\u2019s  support  for  regional  economic  cooperation  in  Central  Asia  grows,\nstrengthening  the  overall  planning,  prioritization  and  implementation  with  the  participating\ncountries will be crucial to continued success of the Program. This may take the form of an\noverall institutional framework. The framework will provide a mechanism for facilitating high-\nlevel policy dialogue and consensus building, key policy decisions, prioritization, coordination,\nand implementation of the Program. The key is to build consensus on a flexible and effective\ninstitutional framework.\n11. Against this background, Phase II\u2014Year Three will be launched. Consistent with the\nphased  approach,  the  initiative  will  focus  on  identifying  and  providing  in-depth  diagnostic\nanalysis of major policy and institutional constraints in the areas discussed above. This will lay a\nsolid foundation for future implementation.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n12. The TA will promote economic growth and raise living standards of the countries in the\nregion through enhanced and expanded regional economic cooperation. Toward this end, its\noperational objectives will focus on (i) the preparation of priority regional infrastructure projects\nin transport; (ii) support for trade and investment facilitation; (iii) exploring ADB's role in the\nbroad regional water/energy/environment issues; and (iv) establishing an overall institutional\nframework  for  guiding  the  Program.  The  institutional  strengthening  under  (iv)  provides  the\nnecessary support for (i) \u2013 (iii), which aim at addressing the key regional factors to promote\neconomic growth and poverty reduction.\nB.  Scope\n13. Specifically, the TA will support the following activities:\n14. For objective (i), the TA will support the establishment of working groups for coordinating\nthe effective preparation of priority road and rail projects including the South Kyrgyz road and\nthe railway linking Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and the PRC. Such working groups have been\nendorsed  by  the  governments  as  an  effective  mechanism  for  project  preparation  and\nimplementation.\n15. For objective (ii), the TA will assist two mutually supportive activities. A sector study on\ncustoms reforms and their cooperation will be conducted. The study will provide an in-depth\nanalytical diagnosis of the region's customs, focusing on its role as a key regulatory institution to\nfacilitate trade and investment. In particular, the study will examine ways to promote effective\ncooperation among the customs in the region. The TA will also support, in compliment to and\nconjunction with an ongoing study,6 a comprehensive review of the impediments to investment\n                  \n6  TA 5968: A Comparative Assessment of Economic Development in Central Asia, for $250,000 approved on 20\nDecember 2000.", "4\nin the region. It will focus on the broad policy environment, key regulations, and administrative\nprocedures that act as obstacles to investors within and from outside the region. Both activities\nwill lead to the formulation of action plans. These plans are expected to be endorsed for future\nactions by the governments  at the planned ministerial-level conference in November 2001.\n16. For objective (iii), the TA will support a regional energy workshop in July 2001. The\nworkshop will (a) facilitate reaching a consensus on policy and institutional improvements for\nrehabilitating the Central Asia power transmission system; and (b) provide a forum to explore\nways and mechanisms towards the rational use and trade of water and energy. The latter will\nform a part of the larger ADB efforts to deal with the broad regional water/energy/environment\nissue. The efforts under the TA will be coordinated with other ADB activities in this area.7\n17. For objective (iv), the TA will support a range of activities towards the establishment of\nan  institutional  framework  for  strengthening  the  overall  planning,  prioritization  and\nimplementation of the Program. This will involve a sequence of consultations and meetings with\nthe participating governments towards building a consensus on an appropriate framework,\nwhich will be flexible and effective, while avoiding over burdening the governments. For this\npurpose, a meeting of senior officials from the participating governments will be held in August\n2001. The framework is expected to be established at a ministerial-level conference tentatively\nscheduled for November 2001 in Urumqi, the PRC.\n18. Finally,  the  TA  will  analyze  the  potential  participation  of  Turkmenistan  in  regional\neconomic cooperation. ADB traditionally conducts such an evaluation before formally admitting\na new member country to the Program.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The estimated TA cost is $1,000,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $950,000 on a grant\nbasis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The  participating  governments  will  provide  the\nremaining $50,000 equivalent, largely in kind. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n20. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. An interdepartmental steering committee,\nto be chaired by the director of ADB\u2019s Programs Department (East), will guide and coordinate\nthe TA activities. A project secretariat will be headed by the head of the Central Asian Regional\nEconomic Cooperation Unit, and will include consultants and support staff. Activities under the\nproposed TA will be coordinated closely with ADB resident missions in the region to ensure\neffective implementation. Close coordination and cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral\nagencies and regional institutions concerned with economic cooperation will also be sought.\nThe TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months starting from 1 July 2001 and will end\nby 30 June 2002.\n21. A total of 12 person-months of services by international consultants and 72 months of\ndomestic consultants will be needed for implementing the TA. All consultants will be selected as\nindividuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.
