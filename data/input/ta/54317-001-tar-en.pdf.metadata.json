INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  the  Government  of \nMongolia reduce the adverse impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and other \nfood insecurity risks in Mongolia. The TA will assess the vulnerabilities of Mongolia\u2019s food supply \nchains, provide policy advice, build capacity to manage food insecurity risks during the COVID-\n19 pandemic, and assist in preparing medium- to long-term strategy and action plan. The strategy \nan action plan will contribute to establishing more resilient food supply chains against a range of \nother food insecurity risks and improve the livelihood of poor and vulnerable groups. The Action \nPlan of the Government of Mongolia for 2020\u20132024, announced in August 2020 by the newly \nformed Cabinet, includes ensuring food security and strengthening food supply chains as priority \nareas.1 The TA will support Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)2 and its \noperational  priorities  of  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security,  and  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Food insecurity. The crisis perpetuated by the COVID-19 pandemic increased food \ninsecurity risks among vulnerable and poor households in Mongolia. The share of the population \nbelow the poverty line declined from 39% to 28% between 2010 and 2018.4 However, 15% of the \npopulation is still clustered just above the poverty line. The poor, on average, spend 43% of their \nhousehold expenditure on food and are particularly vulnerable to increases in food prices. The \npandemic\u2019s adverse shocks of increased food prices and reduced household incomes exacerbate \nthe risk of malnutrition among Mongolia\u2019s vulnerable and poor households, and potentially of \nreversing gains made since 2010 in reducing poverty and improving livelihoods.5      \n \n3.  Food price. The trade disruption associated with the pandemic could trigger food price \nspikes and price volatility in international markets.6 The Russian Federation, a major exporter of \nwheat to Mongolia, announced the temporary suspension of grain exports in April 2020. The \nlogistical  disruptions  caused  by  COVID-19  quarantines  and  other  preventive  measures  in \nMongolia have increased retail food prices. A World Bank survey indicates that 58% of farm \nhouseholds were unable to sell products in April 2020 because of logistical disruptions.7 Higher \nfood price is a major contributor to inflation in Mongolia. In March 2020, food price increased by \n10.5% from the same period in 2019 and the inflation rate reached 6.4%, of which 27.0% was \nattributed to the higher prices of meat and meat products.8 Three in four poor households were \nnegatively affected by the high prices of major food items (footnote 7).  \n \n \n1  Government of Mongolia, Cabinet. 2020.

Mongolia\u2019s gross industrial output declined by 20% and exports \ndeclined by 42% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.9 The World \nBank  survey  found  that  70%  of  farmer  and  herder  households  experienced  a  decline  in \nagricultural income in May 2020 compared to the same month last year (footnote 7). ADB \nforecasts that Mongolia\u2019s economy will contract, reducing the gross domestic product growth rate \nfrom 5.2% in 2019 to -2.6% in 2020.10 In Mongolia, small and medium-sized enterprises dominate \nemployment in the urban sector, and small-scale herders dominate employment in the rural sector. \nThe  economic  slowdown  caused  by  the  prolonged  pandemic  is  very  likely  to  raise  the \nunemployment rate and reduce the purchasing power of vulnerable and poor households.  \n \n5.  Social assistance. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government took short-\nterm relief measures to increase assistance to vulnerable and poor households. On 1 May 2020, \nit temporarily increased the amount of food vouchers for the low-income population by 50%, along \nwith the child allowance and the allowances to orphans, disabled people, and certain single \nparents.11 Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, Mongolia needs to carefully monitor the function of \nfood supply chains and assess the food security situation among vulnerable and poor households \nto allow for rapid responses. The short-term relief measures should be accompanied by medium- \nto long-term measures to increase resilience to food insecurity risks, particularly considering the \nlimited fiscal sustainability in Mongolia to provide ad hoc income support to vulnerable populations \nin the future. \n \n6.   Food supply chains. The strict quarantine measures and trade disruptions caused by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic make maintaining food supply chains challenging. The restrictions on \nthe movement of people, goods, and services, as well as other preventive measures (e.g., social \ndistancing), disrupt domestic food supply chains. Food supply chains consist of primary producers, \nfood manufacturing factories, whole sellers, retailers, and agricultural production input suppliers \n(e.g., irrigation facilities). Mongolia has one short growing season so not having a timely supply \nof agricultural production inputs would disrupt grain production. The following vulnerabilities of \nMongolia\u2019s food supply chain are likely to exacerbate supply disruptions during the crisis: a weak \nlogistical and storage network, poor access to financial services among small and medium-sized \nenterprises and small-scale herders, and high dependency on food imports from the Russian \nFederation and the People\u2019s Republic of China.12 The lack of a price monitoring system along the \nfood supply chains (including production inputs, production, processing, wholesale, and retail) \nalso makes it difficult to assess the pandemic\u2019s impact on food supply chains and to identify the \nfood insecurity risks.  \n \n7.  Vulnerabilities. The COVID-19 crisis has provided an opportunity to learn more about the \nvulnerabilities in Mongolia\u2019s food supply chains. In addition to the logistical and trade disruptions, \nMongolia faces a range of food insecurity risks including extreme weather, natural hazards, pests, \n \n9  Government of Mongolia, National Statistics Office. 2020.

Manila (September). \n11 On 27 March 2020, the government launched a countercyclical development expenditure program and announced \nits intention to introduce measures with a cost of MNT5.1 trillion. The program includes three areas of support: social \nprotection measures to support citizens, support to vulnerable businesses and fiscal stimulus measures, and public \nhealth protection. \n12 ADB. Mongolia: Tavan Bogd COVID-19 Wheat Supply Chain Liquidity Support Project ($15 million). In response to \nthe anticipated supply chain disruption, ADB and Tavan Bogd Group companies signed a loan in September 2020 \nto support the wheat supply chain in Mongolia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed TA will explore possible \ncollaborations with the abovementioned project in monitoring food supply chains and identifying ADB\u2019s investment \nopportunities in the preparation of rapid response plans, and medium- to long-term strategy and action plan to \nstrengthen the resilience of food supply chains to food insecurity risks. \n ", "    3 \nand diseases. Agricultural production relies heavily on natural resources and climate conditions. \nManaging food insecurity requires a holistic strategy to reduce, mitigate, and cope with a range \nof risks.13 Finding the right balance between domestic production, imports, and emergency stocks \nis fundamental. Using natural resources sustainably and managing climate change risks are \nessential elements of resilient food supply chains. Mongolia\u2019s weak biosecurity and food safety \narrangements are amplifying the risks to animal and human health.14 Modernizing sanitary \nconditions, maintaining biodiversity, managing animal disease risks, and protecting the workers \nfrom health risks have become important policy agendas in Mongolia. Public and private sectors \nneed to work together to explore the use of digital technologies to develop modern and resilient \nfood supply chains.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand other food insecurity risks in Mongolia reduced. The TA will have the following outcome: \nopportunities to strengthen the resilience of food supply chains to food insecurity risks identified.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Vulnerabilities of Mongolia\u2019s food supply chains assessed. This output will \nsupport (i) monitoring prices along food supply chains, including production inputs, production, \nprocessing, wholesale, and retail; (ii) assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food \nsupply chain disruptions;16 (iii) holistically assessing vulnerabilities in food supply chains against \na range of food insecurity risks; (iv) assessing access to financial services for participants of the \nfood supply chains; and (v) identifying opportunities for public and private partnership to apply \ndigital technologies to monitor prices along food supply chains and to strengthen the resilience of \nfood supply chains.   \n \n10.  Output 2: Strategy and action plan to strengthen the resilience of food supply \nchains  to  food  insecurity  risks  in  Mongolia  produced.  This  output  will  support  (i)  the \npreparation of a rapid response plan to address food insecurity risks during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including strengthening social assistance systems and credit provisions to working \ncapitals through food supply chains; (ii) the preparation of a strategy and action plan, including \npolicy recommendations and investment opportunities to establish more resilient food supply \nchains against a range of food insecurity risks such as improving logistics and storage systems, \nstrengthening food safety and biosecurity arrangements, using natural resources sustainably and \nmanaging  climate  risk,  and  coordinating  policy  mechanisms  between  different  government \nagencies; (iii) the preparation of a feasibility study to establish a price monitoring system along \n \n13 Mongolia\u2019s Third National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change projects \npotentially very significant wheat yield declines in the range of 20%\u201350% by 2080. Research conducted in the \nneighboring Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China suggests these losses are already \nbeing driven by rising temperatures and declining rainfall in the growing season. \n14 Although the origin of COVID-19 is unknown, the World Health Organization estimates that at least 61% of infectious \ndiseases are zoonotic or originate from animals.  \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Representation in Mongolia conducted a rapid \nassessment of food security situation among rural herders and farmer households in April 2020. The National \nStatistics Office of Mongolia and the World Bank also carried out the COVID-19 impact survey on a national sample \nof 1,334 households in May 2020. The TA will explore collaboration with the study and will complement the \nassessment through monitoring the function of wider food supply chains and rural livelihoods.  \n ", "4   \n \nfood supply chains and emergency stock systems; and (iv) a knowledge sharing event among \npublic and private stakeholders to form coordinated actions to build more resilient food supply \nchains in Mongolia.17  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $410,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide in-kind support in the form of counterpart \nstaff remuneration, office space and supplies, data and information, meeting venues, value-added \ntax and duty exemptions for imported goods and equipment to be procured under the TA, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.
