INTRODUCTION \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) was proposed in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nIndia Country Strategy and Program 2003\u20132006, which was endorsed by the Government and \napproved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  30  April  2003.  The  goals,  outputs,  activities, \nimplementing arrangements, and financing arrangements are detailed in this paper. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A densely populated state with a population of 80 million, West Bengal is strategically \nlocated in eastern India bordering Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. The state\u2019s performance in \npoverty  reduction  has  been  impressive.  The  poverty  ratio  declined  from  63.4%  to  27.0% \nbetween FY1973 and FY1999, compared with a decline from 54.9% to 26.1% for India as a \nwhole.   Growth performance has been equally impressive. West Bengal registered a compound \nannual growth rate of 7% during FY1993 to FY2000, the second highest after Karnataka among \nthe major states in India. Table 1 compares West Bengal and all India in terms of key social, \neconomic, and fiscal indicators. West Bengal has also led the rest of the country in agricultural \nperformance during the last two decades, emerging as the largest producer of rice, the third \nlargest producer of fruits and vegetables, and one of the top producers of fish. \n \nTable 1: Key Indicators of West Bengal \n \nWest \nSocioeconomic Indicators  Bengal  India a \nPopulation, 2001 (million)  80.22b 1,027.02b\nLiteracy Rate (%), 2001  69.2b 65.4b\nInfant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births), 2001  53b 71b\nPer Capita Consumption of Electricity (kWh), FY1999  204.4b 354.8b\nPer Capita Income (Rs, current price), FY2001  17,769c 17,978c\nFiscal Indicators (percentage of GSDP for West Bengal and GDP for all \nstates)     \nOwn Tax Revenue, FY2002  4.2d 6.0e\nRevenue Surplus/ Deficit (-), FY2002  (-) 5.2d (-) 2.5e\nFiscal Surplus/ Deficit (-), FY2002  (-) 6.3d (-) 4.7e\nGDP = gross domestic product, GSDP = gross state domestic product. \na Fiscal indicators of India refer to all states. \nb Source: Government of India. 2003.

West Bengal ranks eighth in \nhuman development among all states2. Moreover, during the last 4 decades West Bengal has \ndeclined from being a leading industrial state in India to 9th rank out of 16 major states.  This \ndecline is attributed primarily to the decline of old industries like jute, tea and light engineering, \nwhich were the backbone of the industrial economy.  Also, the public finances of West Bengal \nare in a parlous state, making it particularly difficult to deploy public resources to address the \nurgent  demands  of  development.    A  high  rate  of  public  investment  in  infrastructure  for \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 July 2003. \n2  Planning Commission. 2002. National Human Development Report, 2001. New Delhi. Government of India. ", "2  \ntransportation, energy and irrigation is essential, along with enhanced public expenditure on \nsocial services to accelerate improvement in education and health indicators. Financing these \nexpenses will require strong measures to mobilize additional revenue, and rationalization of \nexpenditure elsewhere. These priorities set the strategic agenda for fiscal consolidation in West \nBengal. \n \n4.  There has been a sustained deterioration in the fiscal situation of the state as witnessed \nby an alarming rise in the fiscal deficit from 4.3% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) in \nFY1995 to as much as 9.1% by FY1999. The ratio has since averaged 7.4%, as against total \nexpenditure amounting to 16.6% of GSDP, implying that around 43% of expenditure is now \nfinanced by fresh borrowings, which are added each year to the stock of debt.  Part of the \nproblem is the low buoyancy of the state\u2019s share of federal revenues (2.7% of GSDP) and the \nstate\u2019s  own  revenue  (4.6%  of  GSDP).3  Some  recent  revenue  mobilization  measures  are \nexpected to raise the state\u2019s own revenue to 5.7% of GSDP. These can perhaps be further \nrationalized, specifically for major sources of own revenue, e.g., sales tax, state excise, etc. The \nstate\u2019s share of federal revenues also needs to be better aligned to its spending responsibilities, \na vertical equity matter which ADB and other stakeholders have flagged in consultations with \nthe 12th Finance Commission.  \n \n5.   On the expenditure side, implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission Report raised the \ntotal bill of wages and salaries to 40% of total current public expenditure.  A second major \ncomponent is debt servicing.  West Bengal\u2019s debt to the federal Government and financial \ninstitutions rose from 28% of GSDP in FY1995 to 45% in FY2002. Inclusive of contingent \nliabilities, this will be even higher at 47% of GSDP.  Moreover, most of this debt is at a relatively \nhigh cost of around 14% interest. Hence, interest on debt servicing now accounts for 33% of \ncurrent expenditure. Also, the state has 89 public sector enterprises, of which 85% are incurring \nlosses. In many cases, the net worth has been largely or completely eroded. The losses have \nresulted in a significant drain on budgetary resources.4  \n \n6.   The  state  government  has  initiated  a  number  of  steps  to  consolidate  its  finances, \nincluding the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of India on \nthe Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Program (MTFRP): FY2000 to FY2004.5 However, the steps \nidentified  in  the  MTFRP  need  to  be  reinforced  by  identifying  and  implementing  required \nadministrative and capacity-building measures, estimating the costs of adjustment, and financing \nthe cost to help bring West Bengal back to a sustainable debt path. The consolidated reform \nmeasures required to address the fiscal challenges may be categorized broadly into two groups: \ndirect reforms to place the state on a sustainable debt path, and capacity-enhancing measures \nnecessary  to  implement  and  sustain  the  reforms.  The  direct  reforms  will  include  (i)  non \ndistortionary tax and nontax revenue measures to optimize own revenue, (ii) debt restructuring to \nreduce the burden of debt services, (iii) public enterprise restructuring, and (iv) review and \nrationalization of public expenditure to optimize allocation of expenditure to infrastructure and \nsocial  services.  The  capacity  enhancing  components  of  reform  will  include  (v)  possible \nrationalization  of  relevant  state  government  departments,  including  the  commercial  tax \ndepartment; (vi) Information Technology (IT) for streamlining services in the financial and other \nrelevant departments of government, including the budget formulating process; and (vii) creation \n                                                 \n3   Central grants account for another 1.3% of GSDP. \n4   Department for International Development (DFID) has provided 26 million pound-sterling grant assistance to GWB   \nto support capacity building in the Department of Public Enterprises for restructuring 17 of these public enterprises \nincluding payments for early retirement. This assistance is ongoing. \n5   Signed by GWB and the Department of Expenditure, Government of India on 26 March 2003. \n ", "      3 \nof  required  databases  for  fiscal  monitoring  and  fiscal  projections,  including  the  impact  of \nmeasures such as pension reform. \n \n7.  The reforms will require significant costs.  Given the current fiscal pressures on West \nBengal loan assistance will be necessary to meet the up-front costs of reforms, including the \ncost of capacity enhancement. This has to be preceded by technical assistance to help develop \na comprehensive fiscal consolidation program and recommend a suitable lending modality. The \nsuggested TA should draw lessons from ADB\u2019s previous interventions in this field. The lessons \ninclude, among others, the following: (i) proposed reform measures should be straightforward, \nappropriately sequenced, well-balanced among various reform areas (revenue, expenditure and \npublic enterprise reform), and achievable within the planned time frame; (ii) TA that combines \ncapacity building in both revenue generation, budget preparation, and expenditure and debt \nmanagement  should  be  focused  and  deal  with  only  those  fiscal  issues;  (iii)  adjustments \nproposed should be directional rather than quantitative; and (iv) the consultant team leader \nshould be a public finance specialist with detailed knowledge of state finances in India. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  TA  aims  to  support  the  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  fiscal  consolidation \nprogram, including capacity enhancement and public awareness components, to strengthen \ndevelopment  financing  in  West  Bengal,  consistent  with  the  MTFRP  MOU  between  the \ngovernment of West Bengal and the federal government. The MOU lays down a list of policy \nactions. These may need to be reviewed for internal consistency. Moreover, the measures will \nalso  require  certain  administrative  and  capacity-enhancing  measures,  especially  for \nimplementing and monitoring various reforms that are not detailed in the MOU. The TA will \nidentify them. The TA will also enable GWB to introduce international best practices. Finally, as \nexplained in para 7, the TA has to estimate the adjustment cost for the proposed measures. \nThus the TA will broadly focus on (i) a sustainable debt management program, including \nidentification of required capacity-enhancing measures to implement the program; (ii) a plan for \nimproved revenue mobilization; (iii) a public expenditure review and rationalization program for \nimproved public resource allocation; (iv) a program for other collateral reforms such as public \nenterprises reform and pension reforms; (v) a capacity-enhancing plan; and (vi) a costing and \npricing plan for the different components of the fiscal consolidation program. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.    Debt Restructuring. The TA will develop a comprehensive debt restructuring program, \nincluding use of existing schemes as appropriate, with the help of a debt restructuring expert.  \nThe exercise will include (i) preparing an overall state debt management program, indicating \nways  to  restructure  past  high-cost  debt;  (ii)  developing  a  detailed  database  of  debt  and \nguarantees for future monitoring of the program; and (iii) addressing comprehensively the issue \nof contingent liabilities arising from GWB guarantees. \n10.   Mobilizing  Additional  Revenue.  Nondistortionary  measures  for  mobilizing  revenue \nneed to be designed under the TA and implemented as part of the overall fiscal consolidation \neffort. More specifically, the TA should take stock of revenue mobilization measures already \ninitiated by GWB, and identify further revenue reform measures, e.g., expanding the base of \nsales tax/(VAT); recommend steps to enhance the buoyancy of stamp duty and registration \n ", "4  \nfees, motor vehicle taxes, state excise duty, and other minor taxes; and recommend ways of \nstrengthening tax administration, including department restructuring and computerization plans, \nif required. In the field of nontax revenues, the TA should recommend a realistic program of \nintroducing user fees.  The TA should also identify justifiable and affordable GWB subsidies for \npublic goods or merit goods, and recommend how such subsidies should be financed. This \nexercise should cover power, transport services, water supply, irrigation, education, and health \ncare among other public services. The TA should also recommend steps to create capacity to \nestimate costs of various publicly provided services and fix tariffs on a continuing basis. \n \n11.  Reviewing and Rationalizing Public Expenditure. Rationalizing public expenditure to \nbetter support growth and human development priorities is important. The TA should support \nGWB in undertaking a detailed public expenditure review, including public expenditure tracking \nsurveys,  which  will  assess  the  impact  of  public  spending.    Rationalizing  and  monitoring  \nexpenditures were not a priority in the past.  The need to do them is now recognized by both the \nfederal and state governments.  The Government has requested that an expenditure tracking \ntechnique used elsewhere be adapted under the TA, at least as a pilot. The public expenditure \nreview will include assessing of overall allocation across sectors, as well as within sectors \nacross different expenditure line items, e.g., salaries and wages, operation and maintenance, \nand other essential recurring costs, capital expenditure on new or ongoing projects, and transfer \nto local governments.  In this context developing indicators that ordinary citizens and state \nlegislators can understand would be useful. The detailed public expenditure review should also \naddress the expenditure risks related to the state\u2019s counterpart funds for federal Government- \nfinanced projects.  \n \n12.   Collateral Reforms. The TA will also examine collateral reform issues bearing on fisal \nconsolidation such as public enterprise reform or pension reform, to be identified in consultation \nwith GWB, to supplement reforms that are already under way or planned.6  This will include  \ncreating a comprehensive employment database and projecting pension liabilities to enable \nGWB to initiate necessary steps for pension reforms. \n \n13.   Preparing a Capacity Enhancement Plan to Support Fiscal Consolidation. The TA \nwill  prepare  an  effective  capacity-building  enhancement  program  including  among  others \nrevenue  administration,  expenditure  management,  computerization,  and  introduction  of  IT-\nenabled services, and change management, to implement and monitor a comprehensive fiscal \nconsolidation program. The TA will also cost and prepare the financing plan for implementing \nthe comprehensive fiscal consolidation program. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent comprising $277,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $723,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.    ADB  will  finance  $800,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $523,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom and to \nbe administered by ADB. The remaining $200,000 equivalent will be contributed by GWB in kind \nand will cover  counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, transport, \nand other logistical support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6 For instance, public enterprise reform proposals will incorporate lessons from restructuring 17 public enterprises  \nunder the DFID project. \n ", "      5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Chief Secretary\u2019s office of GWB will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. A \nsteering committee (SC) chaired by the Chief Secretary will monitor TA implementation, review \nTA  findings  and  suggestions,  and  make  recommendations  to  the  Government  for  their \nimplementation. This arrangement will help to ensure Government ownership of the TA results \nand subsequent implementation of its recommendations. The Government will constitute the SC \nprior to the inception meeting. The SC will consist of key senior officials from the concerned \ndepartments. The EA will provide office space, furniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for \nthe TA consultants. The TA consultants will receive advice and guidance on an operational \nbasis from the SC chairman. \n \n16.  A  consulting  firm  or  firms  will  be  recruited  to  provide  a  team  of  international  and \ndomestic consultants to execute the TA. The firm/s will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants. The quality and cost based selection procedure will be \nfollowed to select the firm. The simplified technical proposal procedure will apply in selecting the \nconsulting firm. About 51 person-months of consulting services (9 international, 42 domestic) \nwill be required. The international consultants will include a public finance specialist as team \nleader and a debt management specialist. The domestic consultants will include an assistant \nteam leader with expertise in state finances and utilities pricing, a public enterprise restructuring \nspecialist,  a  pension  specialist,  a  debt  management  specialist,  a  public  expenditure \nmanagement  specialist,  and  a  public  information  dissemination  specialist,  and  a  research \nofficer. GWB will provide state finance experts. The consultants will prepare an inception report \nwithin 4 weeks of the start of their services and a comprehensive interim report after completing \nhalf of their consulting services. The draft final report covering all the TA components will be \nsubmitted approximately 2 months before the end of consulting services and discussed at a joint \nreview meeting by GWB, ADB, and the consultants. The final report, to be provided as hard \ncopy and soft copy, will incorporate the comments of GWB and ADB, and will be submitted to \nADB within a month of the tripartite meeting. The outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. A summary initial poverty and social analysis report is in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  The TA will provide equipment (computer hardware, photocopy equipment, printers, etc.) \nas  needed.  All  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement and will be handed over to the EA after the TA is completed. Implementation of the \nTA will spread over 10 months and is expected to start in September 2004. Physical completion \nof the TA is expected by July 2005.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for West \nBengal Development Finance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6         Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL
