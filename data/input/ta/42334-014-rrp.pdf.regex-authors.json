I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be \nprovided by the Government of Australia, and (iii) proposed administration by ADB of a grant to \nbe provided by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Rural \nRoads Improvement Project II.1 \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate about 729 kilometers (km) of rural roads in nine provinces \n(Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Kampong  Cham,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Speu, \nKampong Thom, Pursat, Siem Reap, and Takeo) to paved condition. The rehabilitated roads will \nprovide poor rural provinces with a safer, cost-effective rural road network with all-year access \nto  markets  and  other  social  services.  The  project  will  also  support  a  sustainable  road \nmaintenance regime in the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), a community-based road \nsafety  program,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program \n(HHTPP), and climate change adaptation measures. The feasibility study for the project was \ncompleted through the Rural Roads Improvement Project2 and project preparatory technical \nassistance.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Roads are the principal mode of transport in Cambodia. The country\u2019s road network of \n51,764 km includes (i) about 5,623 km of national roads (primary national highways); (ii) about \n6,641 km of provincial roads (secondary national highways); and (iii) about 39,500 km of rural \nroads. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible for the national and \nprovincial roads; MRD is responsible for rural roads. \n \n4.  By the early 1990s, after years of civil war, the country\u2019s road network had deteriorated \nseverely.  Since  1992,  with  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment partners, the government has focused on rehabilitating core national infrastructure \nrequired for the economy to develop in a sustainable manner. Development efforts have brought \nthe paved national road network to about 2,700 km, slightly less than 25% of the total national \nand provincial road network. \n \n5.  As the rural economy is becoming increasingly dependent on the improved national road \nnetwork, the rural road network continues to deteriorate. This is due to rapidly growing traffic, \nlack  of  maintenance  financing,  poor  road  maintenance  standards,  inadequate  institutional \ncapacity for road maintenance and management. In addition, lack of private contractor capacity, \nand shortcomings in design and construction methods do contribute to the situation. \n \n6.  In  2010,  ADB  approved  the  first  Rural  Roads  Improvement  Project  (footnote  2)  to \nimprove more than 505 km of rural roads to paved condition. This project aimed to provide \nreliable  all-year  access  from  provincial  towns  and  agricultural  rural  areas  to  markets, \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Rural Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n3  Four outputs of the proposed project were designed under Rural Roads Improvement Project (footnote 2). For the \nremaining output, ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Mekong River Island Connectivity Output. Manila (TA 8322-CAM). ", "2 \nemployment  centers,  and  social  services  in  seven  provinces,  serving  about  0.6  million \nbeneficiaries. The provinces are Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong \nSpeu, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap\u2014most are located around the Tonle Sap Basin, \nwhere a large proportion of Cambodia's rural poor live. These rural gravel roads are typically 5\u2013\n6 meters wide; some are vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. The roads had low to \nmoderate traffic; average daily traffic volume ranges from 200 to 2,000 passenger car units, \ndepending on the road section. Motorcycles made up nearly 80% of the traffic. The current \nannual growth rate of traffic is 3.6%\u20136.0%, based on vehicle type. These growth rates were \nforecast to increase by 7.2%\u201312.0% per annum, thus a more sustainable and paved rural road \nnetwork is required to accommodate future traffic, along with properly maintained national and \nprovincial road network. \n \n7.  The proposed project aims to continue and expand the initiatives of the Rural Roads \nImprovement Project by rehabilitating about 729 km of rural roads in the seven original project \nprovinces and two additional provinces (Banteay Meanchey and Takeo). The implementation \nsupervision consulting services of the Rural Roads Improvement Project made provisions to (i) \ndesign the project to enhance ownership and build MRD capacity,4 (ii) build upon lessons, and \n(iii) ensure a seamless continuation of initiatives.5 This is a successful example of the use of \nlessons from previous initiatives. \n \n8.  As a consequence of relatively rapid economic development and activity, overloading of \ncargo vehicles has been the major cause of road damage in Cambodia since 2007. This is also \na serious issue for rural roads due to overloaded trucks that haul agricultural products and those \nthat carry quarry materials for construction. While ADB is currently supporting axle-load control \nprograms for national and provincial road networks, the project aims to extend the ongoing \noverloading control program to rural roads. \n \n9.  Deteriorating road safety is also a major concern, especially with increasing growth of \ntraffic in rural areas. In 2012, Cambodia\u2019s road crash rate was 13.4 fatalities per 100,000 \ninhabitants, a threefold increase since 2002. Increased traffic speeds resulting from improved \npaved road surfaces can also impose tremendous safety risks to rural communities. In line with \nthe national umbrella programs for road safety and ADB's ongoing support, the Rural Roads \nImprovement Project has been assisting MRD to design and manage a community-based rural \nroad safety program. These activities will continue under the project in all nine project provinces. \n \n10.  Additionally, given recent natural disasters in Cambodia, particularly frequent flooding \nduring the wet season, climate change considerations must be incorporated in the project \ndesign.  The  Rural  Roads  Improvement  Project  supported  initial  climate  change  adaptation \ninterventions in climate-resilient road design; hazard mapping; maintenance planning; green \nplanting; and planning for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. The outcomes of \nthese initiatives are being applied in other ongoing road projects in the country, and the project \nwill (i) implement green planting in all nine project provinces; and (ii) design and implement a \ncommunity-based emergency management system for an island cluster in the Mekong River, \nKampong Cham province (footnote 5). \n \n11.  This island cluster in the Mekong River comprises five remote islands, which are highly \nvulnerable to flooding. The islands lack organized all-year access to the mainland or between \n                                                 \n4  Output: Rural Roads Improvements\u2014Road Selection Criteria and Climate-Resilient Road Design (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  Lessons Learned (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nthe islands. Due to recent climate change impacts, this lack of access to emergency facilities \nhas  resulted  in  about  10  fatalities  of  island  residents  per  year.  Improving  access  and \nconnectivity will increase the climate resilience of the island cluster. \n \n12.  The  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132013  for \nCambodia  is  poverty  reduction,  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development \npriorities.6 The  strategy  focuses  on  two  strategic  objectives:  (i)  inclusive  economic  growth \nthrough  provision  of  physical  infrastructure,  as  well  as  interventions  in  other  development \nactivities such as vocational training, agriculture, and finance sector development; and (ii) social \ndevelopment and equity. Rehabilitating and enhancing the climate resilience of rural roads \nunder the project will improve the access of the rural poor to markets and social services, and is \na  core  means  of  promoting  inclusive  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty,  as  well  as \nenhancing social development and equity. The strategy includes four road projects; all are \nconsistent with the sector assistance program evaluation recommendation to shift the focus to \nrehabilitating provincial and rural roads, rather than national roads.7 ADB approved the first \nprovincial road project in 20098 and the second in 2011.9 In 2010, ADB approved the Rural \nRoads Improvement Project, the first rural road project to improve the access of the rural poor to \nservices. The proposed project incorporates lessons from the Rural Roads Improvement Project \n(footnote 5). No other major development partner is assisting with rural roads; they are currently \nworking on national and provincial roads.10 \n \n13.  The government's national strategy for growth for 2013\u20132018 (Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth,  Employment,  Equity,  and  Efficiency,  Phase  III)  emphasizes  the  need  to  develop \nphysical  infrastructure  with  three  core  areas  (agriculture  sector  promotion,  private  sector \ndevelopment and employment, and capacity building and human resource development).11 The \nproject  supports  this  strategy,  particularly  as  it  enhances  connectivity,  balanced  economic \ndevelopment, and access to social services in the nine remote rural provinces. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of the project will be improved access to markets, jobs, and social services in \nnine project provinces. This is consistent with the sector results framework of the Cambodia \nTransport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.12 The outcome of the project is a safe, \nclimate-resilient,  and  cost-effective  rural  road  network  that  provides  all-year  access  in \nagricultural areas of the nine project provinces. The populations of the nine provinces comprise \na large proportion of Cambodia\u2019s rural poor. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The  project  has  five  key  outputs:  (i)  rural  road  improvements,  (ii)  rural  road  asset \nmanagement,  (iii)  rural  road  safety  and  community  awareness  program,  (iv)  project \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011.

About 729 km of rural roads will be improved to climate-\nresilient paved condition. Of the 11 civil works contracts, one will be a pilot performance-based \ncontract  with  a  5.5-year  duration.13 This  output  includes  green  planting  and  design,  and \nimplementation supervision consulting services. \n \n17.  Rural road asset management. A strong capacity-building program will be provided to \nimprove  sustainable  rural  road  asset  management  for  improving  the  overall  institutional \narrangements and practices for rural road maintenance. The program will continue interventions \ninitiated in the Rural Roads Improvement Project, including the overloading prevention program \nfor rural roads to efficiently manage road assets.14 The output continues the focus of the Rural \nRoads  Improvement  Project  on  improving  the  overall  construction  industry  for  rural  road \nmaintenance, including capacity development of Provincial Departments of Rural Development \n(PDRD),  which  implement  road  maintenance  works.  Capacity-building  approaches  will  be \nintroduced to gradually reduce the use of force account by PDRDs, using lessons from similar \nongoing interventions in MPWT.15 \n \n18.  Rural  road  safety  and  community  awareness  program.  The  awareness  and \napplication  of  road  safety  and  safeguards  will  be  increased  by  (i)  expanding  the  pilot \ncommunity-based road safety awareness program initiated in the Rural Roads Improvement \nProject, including the education program for schools, drivers, road users, and the community; \nand incorporating road safety provisions in road design; (ii) strengthening the capacity of MRD\u2019s \nSocial and Environment Office (SEO, established in 2012); (iii) implementing an HHTPP; and \n(iv) conducting a sex-disaggregated socioeconomic baseline survey of project beneficiaries.16 \n \n19.  Project management support. The capacity of MRD will be strengthened to provide \nefficient  project  management  support  for  project  implementation.  The  project  will  promote \nsubstantial positive employment and gender impacts in rural communities under all outputs. The \ngender action plan (GAP) will incorporate all employment and gender-mainstreaming activities \nin  all  five  project  outputs  (para.  28). 17  Using  lessons  from  the  ongoing  Rural  Roads \nImprovement Project (footnote 5), the proposed project will strengthen MRD's focus on all \noutputs  equally,  as  the  tendency  has  been  somewhat  inclined  toward  road  improvement \nactivities. This will be achieved through increased MRD staff resources in social, gender, and \nsafeguard areas. \n \n20.  Connectivity  improvements  for  Mekong  River  islands. The output has two sub-\noutputs: (i) rehabilitation of roads and jetties within a five-island cluster in the Mekong River \n(Koh Mitt, Koh Pir, Koh Samrong, Koh Soutin, and Koh Thmei) to improve climate-resilient \naccess and connectivity (the civil works contract for rehabilitating roads and jetties includes \nprovisions for small-scale levees and water management interventions to minimize flooding); \nand (ii) development of a climate change adaptation framework and associated investments for \nminor multisector activities (e.g., agriculture, renewable energy, tourism, water supply) that will \n                                                 \n13 The project plans include 12 civil works contracts (including one financed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea). \nTwo contracts are planned under the Connectivity Improvement for Mekong River Islands output. \n14 Output: Rural Road Asset Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB. 2009.

The project management unit, which is \nimplementing the Rural Roads Improvement Project, will be the implementing agency of this \nproposed project. The project will be implemented from 2014 to 2020. The implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3.22 All  goods  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and all \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time), subject to eligibility requirements waiver.23 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2014\u2013June 2020 \nEstimated completion date  June 2020 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Project management unit (PMU) \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU under MRD, Phnom Penh; 66 staff \nProcurement  ICB  8 contracts  $53.39 million \nNCB  3 contracts  $1.61 million \n                                                 \n21 This amount may be adjusted for currency fluctuations to match the grant amount received by ADB. \n22 Details are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The project is technically viable, as the design considers local design standards with \nconstruction materials and equipment compatible with local conditions. All 729 km will be paved \nfor all-year climate-resilient access, of which Mekong River island roads will be concrete, while \nthe remaining roads will be paved with double bituminous surface treatment. The connectivity \nimprovements for Mekong River islands output is designed to mitigate annual climate change \nrisks for the island cluster. While under the rural road asset management output, MRD will \nutilize mobile weigh pads that may be maintained through locally available technology, all other \noutputs will also ensure the use of similar technology for prolonged sustainability. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The improvement of rural roads under the project will serve about 620,000 project \nbeneficiaries; the vast majority are poor rural residents. The approach used to evaluate the \nproject follows the standard practice of comparing the lifecycle costs of the road agency and \nroad users, with and without the project. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the \nproject is 32.4%; the EIRRs for individual road sections are above 12%. The sensitivity analysis \nshows that the EIRR is most sensitive to variations in traffic from the base year or the traffic \ngrowth rate. If either of these decrease by 70%, which is unlikely, the project will not be viable. \nThe risk analysis shows that the likelihood of the project not reaching an EIRR of 12% is less \nthan 1%. Since the project is not revenue generating, the financial analysis focuses on its \nfinancial sustainability. The assessment of MRD\u2019s financial capacity finds it  to be sufficient to \nmeet  the  recurrent  expenditures of  operating  and  maintaining  the  project  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.24 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith the Government of Cambodia and MRD. The policy will be applied throughout project \nimplementation.  In  addition,  a  governance  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan \n                                                 \n24 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n(GRARMP)  was  developed  in  coordination  with  the  government. 25  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures to ensure good governance are described in the \nproject administration manual (PAM). The GRARMP will be posted on the MRD and ADB \nwebsites. Review missions will closely monitor compliance with the GRARMP\u2019s provisions and \nrequirements.  The  financial  management  assessment  confirms  that  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies have, in general, an acceptable financial management arrangement to \nimplement  the  project.  Nonetheless,  financial  management  risks  are  high  in  some  areas. \nImplementation of mitigation measures described in the GRARMP will reduce the risk to low. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Paved rural roads will significantly benefit poor and physically isolated rural residents in \nthe project provinces, including women and children. Local economic development depends on \nimproved connectivity, and paved roads reduce travel time, increase convenience, and make it \nsafer for women and girls to travel farther from home. Better access to services will improve \nrural residents\u2019 health and educational attainment. Girls will have a better chance of attending \nsecondary school, markets will be easier to reach, and micro and small enterprise opportunities \nfor women will increase. From a health perspective, rural villages will benefit from a significant \nreduction in dust, which is linked to respiratory disease, a major cause of child mortality in \nCambodia. Road construction and maintenance also generate jobs and income for rural men \nand women. The project's GAP will ensure that contractors give priority to local residents for \nconstruction and road maintenance jobs, with specific targets for women\u2019s participation. MRD\u2019s \nSEO will continue to use the Ready for Roads training materials and tools developed under the \nRural Roads Improvement Project to promote women\u2019s access to these jobs. Men and women \nwill  receive  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  Potentially  negative  social  impacts  of  increased \nconnectivity will be monitored and mitigated through the HHTPP. A rural road safety community \nawareness program will promote the safety of road users and local residents. The project is \ncategorized as having effective gender mainstreaming with specific targets included in the \ndesign and monitoring framework and GAP in the PAM, section VIII. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Since none of the project roads will be widened, resettlement impacts are expected to be \nminimal. Therefore, the project is classified category C for resettlement under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (SPS,  2009).  Nevertheless,  a  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  in \ncompliance with the SPS to mitigate involuntary resettlement impacts in case they arise due to \nroad widening during project implementation.26 Similarly, since the social assessments in the \nproject areas during project design did not indicate the presence of indigenous peoples, the \nproject is category C for indigenous peoples under the SPS. \n \n30.  The environment category for the project is B given the nature of the project (i.e., \nimprovement of existing roads, no widening of roads). Some project roads in Battambang and \nPursat are located in the transition zone of Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. In addition, some \nactivities under the connectivity improvements for Mekong River islands output, including the \nconstruction of 11 jetties, will take place near the Mekong River. Although none of the project \nactivities are expected to have serious impacts on nearby areas (Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve \nand Mekong River), MRD has obtained a no objection on project implementation from relevant \n                                                 \n25 Governance Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2); with a specific loan covenant in the Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n26 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nauthorities  (Ministry  of  Environment,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology,  and \nCambodian  Mekong  River  Commission).  The  initial  environmental  examination,  including \nMekong  River  island  connectivity  output  and  its  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, was prepared in compliance with the SPS. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Given the procurement management problems that other development partners have \nhad with MRD, risk mitigation measures need to be established. The overall risk assessment is \nmedium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. The \npreliminary  assessment  during  project  design  identified  three  major  risks  during  project \nimplementation  related  to  procurement,  corruption,  and  technical  due  diligence.  ADB  will \nconduct intensive project reviews to mitigate all the risks effectively. The GRARMP is expected \nto  reduce  procurement  and  corruption  risks;  while  close  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Finance is expected to reduce corruption and due diligence risks. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.27 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMisprocurement in selection  Review eight ICB and three NCB contracts thoroughly with intensive \nand award of civil works  project reviews, closely coordinate with MEF and implement actions \ncontracts  required under the GRARMP. \nCorruption that may happen  Implement the GRARMP to strengthen internal controls, conduct intensive \nduring financial management  project reviews, and coordinate closely with MEF. \nTechnical due diligence  Conduct due diligence on all technical aspects through intensive project \nweaknesses in design and  reviews and closely coordinate with MEF. \nsupervision of construction \nGRARMP = governance risk assessment and risk management plan; ICB = international competitive bidding; MEF = \nMinistry of Economy and Finance; NCB = national competitive bidding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n32.
