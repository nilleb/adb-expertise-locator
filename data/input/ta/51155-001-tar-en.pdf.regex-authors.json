INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \npreparation  of  demand-driven  analytical  work  in  innovative  areas  of  connectivity  and \ncompetitiveness to promote new regional cooperation and integration (RCI) operations and \ncollective action mechanisms to help address key issues affecting the future of RCI in Asia and \nthe Pacific region over the medium term. It will also develop systematic methods to enhance the \nquality of RCI project classification and operations reporting. The TA will draw on ground-level \nexperience of operations departments and joint work with various sector and thematic groups. \n \n2.  This corporate priority TA aims to support the implementation of the Operational Plan for \nRCI, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved in September 2016.1 The \noperational plan provides guidance for ADB\u2019s RCI operations in helping developing member \ncountries (DMCs) harness increased benefits through improved cooperation and integration.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The operational plan assessed progress, challenges, and opportunities in RCI since 2006 \nwhen ADB adopted the RCI strategy. As a result, the following key changes in the focus of ADB\u2019s \nknowledge work were identified as necessary to address emerging development challenges of its \nDMCs effectively: (i) promoting operationally relevant knowledge work to support strengthened \nconnectivity, enhanced competitiveness in connected markets, and investment in regional public \ngoods; (ii) focusing innovative RCI knowledge work on inter-subregional signature RCI operations; \nnascent subsectors, sectors, and multisectors for RCI; and nonsovereign RCI operations; (iii) \npromoting collective Asian leadership of RCI; and (iv) addressing critical quality issues, especially \nthose related to the classification and reporting of RCI operations. \n4.  Key  emerging  regional  development  challenges,  which  must  be  addressed  through \ninnovative RCI knowledge, are (i) slowing global and regional trade growth, (ii) geographical trade \naccess inequalities, and (iii) small business trade access challenges.3 While cyclical factors \nunderlying trade growth may be easing, as reflected by rapid global trade growth in the first quarter \nof 2017, structural constraints to trade growth persist. It has also become increasingly important \nto generate trade-driven economic benefits in lagging areas and mitigate challenges of access to \ntrade channels for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and smallholders. \n \n5.  Asia and the Pacific region has achieved substantial progress in infrastructure connectivity. \nThrough years of investments in land transport projects such as the Asian Highway and Trans-\nAsian Railways, a network of 140,000 kilometers of roads in 32 countries has been developed, \nenabling better connectivity both within Asia and between Asia and Europe.4 Yet, despite this \nprogress,  the  projected  infrastructure  investment  demand for  the region  during  2016\u20132030 \nremains enormous at $26 trillion, or $1.7 trillion per year.5 Regional corridors are becoming \nincreasingly multimodal beyond the road subsector, whose share in overall ADB lending for RCI \nin  transport  decreased  from  90%  in  2011  to  60%\u201370%  in  2016\u20132017,  with  an  increased \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting Connectivity, \nCompetitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 July 2017. \n3  Developing Asia\u2019s annual average export volume growth decreased from 11.2% (2000\u20132010) to 4.7% (2011\u20132015). \nADB. 2016.

Includes costs of climate mitigation and adaptation. \n ", "2 \npercentage of demand coming from railways, airports, and ports. The ports sector is particularly \nimportant  in  multimodal  connectivity.  The  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and \nDevelopment\u2019s 2015 maritime sector analysis indicated that 90% of DMCs\u2019 bulk goods trade is \ncarried by sea; however, the 2016 analysis showed that traditional maritime goods trade growth \nis  slowing,  largely  due  to  the  slowdown  in  global  demand. 6  Nonetheless,  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  trade  policy  and  liberalization,  and  urbanization  could  stimulate  growth  and \nseaborne trade and provide opportunities for developing countries. Consequently, there is greater \nneed than ever before to examine port competitiveness issues and sustainability challenges. \n \n6.  In terms of competitiveness, much work has been done on tariffs, and progress is being \nmade in trade facilitation at the global and regional levels. However, in discussions of global trade \npolicy and regional free trade areas, agricultural trade has been the most intractable subject. \nAgricultural trade costs are high while subsidies in developed countries continue to distort global \nagricultural trade. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to focus on (i) implementing trade \nfacilitation related to sanitary and phytosanitary standards, (ii) determining required transport and \nlogistics infrastructure investments, (iii) adopting technology for climate change risk mitigation and \nadaptation, and (iv) conducting business research for different segments to enable smallholders \nto participate fully in trade and ensure climate resilience. \n \n7.  Thus  far,  Asia\u2019s  model  of  regionalism  has  supported  the  DMCs\u2019  development  path \neffectively. ADB has supported a bottom\u2013up approach by providing financing, partnership, and \n\u201chonest broker\u201d secretariat services support to subregional economic cooperation programs and \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)+3  initiatives.7 However,  the  landscape \nsurrounding RCI has changed substantially, with the global environment becoming less benign \nwith regard to free trade and investment while trade growth has slowed.8 RCI initiatives have been \nlaunched in the region,9 but although these provide momentum to sustain open regionalism, they \nmust be underpinned by private sector participation and pragmatic project delivery to share the \nbenefits among the DMCs. A proper Asian collective action umbrella is needed to lead regional \nefforts to promote inclusive trade, investment, technology, and skilled labor flows in the region. \n \n8.  A major emerging driver of trade growth has been cross-border e-commerce.10 In this \ncontext, ASEAN plus Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Japan, the Republic \nof Korea (ROK), and New Zealand (ASEAN+6), through the Regional Comprehensive Economic \nPartnership, constitute a potentially large and dynamic e-commerce market. Given the likely \ndivergences among ASEAN+6 countries on the depth of provisions in the partnership, further \neffort may be needed to assess the costs and benefits of easing barriers to e-commerce. \n \n9.  Beyond thematic analyses, it is necessary to ensure quality reporting of RCI operational \nresults in line with the RCI Operational Plan\u2019s requirements. Improvements are needed in RCI \nproject classification, economic analysis, and sector master planning for RCI incorporating the \nquantification of regional spillover and estimates for design and monitoring framework indicators. \n                                                \n6  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2015 and 2016.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: regional connectivity and competitiveness in \nconnected markets and Asia\u2019s collective action leadership strengthened. The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: options for more innovative RCI interventions developed.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n11.  Output 1: New areas of connectivity supported. A knowledge product on best practices \nin port city connectivity, as part of multimodal transport connectivity, will be prepared. Up to four \ncompetitive and sustainable port cities in connectivity corridors among Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) Program countries, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and/or the \nPacific will be chosen with the aim of maximizing the quality of port connectivity among them in \nterms of trade and environmental benefits. Port cities will be twinned to develop them as sister \ncompetitive and sustainable port cities. In prioritizing port city-related investments, multimodal \nconnectivity, maritime trade, ports governance, urban planning, and tourism-cum-environmental \nanalysis will be undertaken.12 The knowledge product will be developed with the Transport Sector \nGroup, regional departments, and knowledge partners; and designed to promote best practices \nto enhance the quality of port connectivity between twinned port cities and develop pilot projects.13 \n \n12.  Output 2: Competitiveness through new opportunities supported. Two knowledge \nproducts will be produced. First, a thematic study on Timor-Leste\u2013(Eastern) Indonesia regional \ncooperation will be designed to (i) establish the viability of a cross-border economic zone as part \nof a new economic corridor, and (ii) develop potential RCI interventions to operationalize such a \ncorridor.14 The study, to be undertaken with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and Pacific \nDepartment, will cover (i) trade-driven diversification (baseline estimation and forecasting of \nbilateral trade and trade with ASEAN markets); (ii) cross-border services for SMEs (covering \nfinancial and business development services); (iii) investment-driven diversification (focusing on \ncross-border agriculture/natural resources value chains and tourism, which could attract foreign \ndirect investment; (iv) transport connectivity enhancement to support trade demands (covering \nroads and port gateway); (v) institutional capacity and coordination for the development of a cross-\nborder zone to support existing and new trade patterns; and (vi) an RCI-driven growth model for \nborder areas through a cross-border zone as part of a new economic corridor to generate higher \nproductivity and more balanced economic growth.  \n \n13.  The second knowledge product will address cross-border agricultural trade, investment, \nand value chains. The study will be conducted with ADB\u2019s Rural Development and Food Security \n(Agriculture)  Thematic  Group,  the  agribusiness  unit  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment, global and regional partners,15 and ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department. The \nstudy will use surveys relating to potential agricultural trade between two selected Central Asian \nDMCs, which are part of an agricultural production belt with Europe and/or another part of the \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2014.

The study\u2019s content will cover (i) trade-driven diversification through inter-subregional \nagricultural trade; (ii) cross-border services for smallholders; (iii) investment-driven diversification \n(agricultural value chains and foreign direct investment in agribusiness); and (iv) infrastructure \nsupply for agriculture value chains (e.g., airports and cold chain storage). The aim of the study is \nto develop (i) a regional knowledge hub in Kazakhstan for best practices of inter-subregional \nagricultural trade and investment, and (ii) potential pilot RCI projects for Central Asian DMCs. \n \n14.  Output 3: Asia\u2019s collective action leadership supported. A study will be conducted on \nthe potential of ASEAN+6 to emerge as the hub of collective Asian leadership. Building on the \nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations on trade and investment, this would \nentail exploiting the potential among ASEAN+6 to cooperate on cross-border e-commerce. This \nstudy\u2014which will be developed with the Financial Cooperation and Integration Team in ADB\u2019s \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD), Southeast Asia Department, \nand South Asia Department\u2014will use information and communication technology infrastructure \nassessment, integration analysis, and surveys to assess (i) information and communication \ntechnology access and adoption; (ii) e-commerce trade and logistics barriers; (iii) variances in \nregulatory regimes and barriers to technology-enabled digital payment for cross-border online \npayments; and (iv) skills gaps, especially for SMEs. The findings will be used to develop pilot RCI \nprojects to enhance cross-border e-commerce within ASEAN+6, and thereby strengthen its role \nas a hub of trade growth. The study will involve India and a selected ASEAN DMC. A benchmark \ncountry among the ASEAN+6 will provide experts and knowledge-sharing experience.16 \n \n15.  Output 4. Quality of operations and reporting of results enhanced. This will entail \nsupporting RCI project classification through scorecards and economic analysis training linked to \nsector master planning; establishing a comprehensive RCI management information system; and \nRCI corporate reporting. These outputs will be developed in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Strategy, \nPolicy and Review Department, ADB\u2019s Economic Analysis and Operational Support Division \n(ERCD), regional departments, and the transport and energy sector groups. \n \n16.  Findings and recommendations will be discussed at an RCI roundtable conference or at \nADB annual meeting seminars, and contained in publications.17 Good practices and lessons will \nbe shared through the RCI Thematic Group\u2019s knowledge events and the group\u2019s website. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,650,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and $150,000 from the Government \nof the United Kingdom. ADB will administer the funds from the United Kingdom. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months from July 2017 to January 2020. ADB will be \nthe executing agency of the TA. The RCI Thematic Group Secretariat in ADB\u2019s ERCD will be \nresponsible for implementing and administering the TA, providing research guidance, engaging \nin research with consultants, and working with operations departments and sector and other \nthematic  groups;  the  Strategy,  Policy  and  Review  Department;  and  ERCD  units.  Select \ndepartments will be asked to assign a team member to co-lead their components (Table).  \n                                                \n16 The ROK could fill this role. \n17 Target readers include policymakers, RCI institutions (e.g., subregional fora), the private sector, ADB, and bilateral \nand other multilateral institutions.
