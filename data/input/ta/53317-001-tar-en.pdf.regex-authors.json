INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the macroeconomic \nstability,  financial  resilience,  and  capacity  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN)+3 policy makers to craft strategic agenda, and identify policy priorities and directions \nthat  can  help  countries  manage  both  the  short-term  risks  and  medium-term  vulnerabilities \nemanating from increasing interconnectedness, rapid technology advances, recurring financial \nvolatilities and crises, and uncertainties from disease outbreaks or epidemics, climate change and \neconomic  policy  shocks  such  as  trade  tension,  through  research,  database  solutions,  and \nknowledge events.1 It aims to support ADB\u2019s mandate and work on regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) and improve macro- and micro-prudential regulation, and supervision of financial \ninstitutions. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved 2020 annual work program for the \nEconomic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation  Department  (ERCD)  under  policy  research \nagenda for the benefit of developing member countries (DMCs).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The velocity of growth and development is increasing and we are bound to see larger \nfluctuations in economic growth due to big shocks emanating from financial crisis, technology \ndisruptions, commodity crisis, climate change disasters, health-related issues like epidemics, \ncyber-attacks, financial and policy uncertainties, and threats from geopolitical dynamics\u2014which \nwill inevitably trigger a fallout affecting economic growth.3 These volatilities and uncertainties will \noccur at an exponential rate, with the economic impact spreading with great speed, intensity, and \ndiversity affecting many countries.4 Therefore, building resilience and nurturing capacities to craft \npolicies and build strategic agenda to cope with these challenges are critical.5 While crises- and \nresilience-related studies exist, research gaps remain as the nature of crises change and new \nbest practices evolve to respond to these shocks.6  \n \n4.  In this regard, a regional knowledge and support technical assistance project is proposed \nto strengthen the macroeconomic stability and financial resilience,7 and build capacities of \nASEAN+3 policy makers through the (i) production of knowledge products that will identify \nregional  and  national  knowledge  solutions  and  disseminate  strategic  policy  advice;  (ii) \n \n1  The ASEAN+3 regional mechanism was established in 1999 to strengthen and deepen East Asia cooperation at \nvarious levels and in various areas, particularly in economic, social and political areas. ASEAN+3 economies \ncomprise of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the 10 member economies of the ASEAN. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 May 2020. \n3  IMF Regional Economic Outlook, Asia Pacific, Asia at the Forefront: Growth Challenges for the Next Decade and \nBeyond \n4  Proceedings: The Future of Asia and the World: Implications for Development Finance, 8th Meeting of the \nInternational Policy Advisory Group, 12\u201313 September 2016, Asian Development Bank Headquarters. \n5  Resilience means the ability to recover from shocks (absorptive), to return to the previous state prior to the shock \n(adaptive), and to implement reforms that help the system adopt to similar shocks in the future (transformative). \n6  Some of these studies include R.P. Buckley, E. Avgouleas, and D.W. Arner. 2017. Twenty Years of International \nFinancial Crises: What Have We Learned and What Still Needs to Be Done? Manuscript submitted for ADB \nEconomics Working Paper Series in 2019; S. Claessens. 2017. Financial Cycles and Crises in Asia. Manuscript; and \nPark, C.Y., J. Lee, J. Villafuerte, and P. Rosenkranz. 2017 20 Years After the Asian Financial Crisis: Lessons Learned \nand Future Challenges. ADB Briefs No. 85. ADB: Manila. \n7  Macroeconomic stability refers to an economoy that has minimized its vulnerability to external shocks. Financial \nresilience means the ability of the financial system to recover from shocks (absorptive), to return to the previous state \nprior to the shock (adaptive), and to implement reforms that help the system adopt to similar shocks in the future \n(transformative).  \n ", "2 \nestablishment of an electronic library and information platforms and/or database solutions that will \nenhance access to data, information, and knowledge for 8 selected DMCs; and (iii) delivery of \ncapacity building seminars and South-South policy dialogue to exchange experience, lessons, \nand policy recommendations to help the 8 selected DMCs respond to shocks.8 The TA is aligned \nwith Strategy 2030\u2019s RCI operational priority which indicates focus on creating regional knowledge \nsolutions to address common risks and vulnerabilities and strengthening regional cooperation in \nthe macroeconomic and financial sector.9 The TA also takes into account the strategic directions \nidentified by ASEAN+3 finance officials in May 2019, namely, (i) promoting local currency usage \nfor  trade  and  investment  settlement,  as  well  as  payment  connectivity,  (ii)  developing \ncomprehensive initiative on infrastructure financing, (iii) designing more supporting facilities to \nhelp members better deal with macro-critical structural issues that may have major implications \nfor financial stability and economic growth, and weather financial crises with changing nature and \ngrowing spillover risks, (iv) exploring cooperation in the fields of mitigation and adaptation of \nclimate change, and (v) enhancing policy coordination to harness benefits of the technological \nadvancement while minimizing the risks to the job markets and financial systems. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact(s): Effects of shocks contained through greater \nmacroeconomic stability and financial resilience.10 The TA will have the following outcome: \nGreater  macroeconomic  stability  and  financial  resilience  achieved.  These  will  be  done  by \nsupporting  the  ASEAN+3  regional  mechanisms  and  capacities  of  policymakers  in  target \neconomies.11  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.  Output  1:  Knowledge  products  with  regional  and  country-level  policy \nrecommendations delivered. These are grouped into two categories: (a) knowledge product (a \nbook) that identify regional and country-level policy recommendations to address critical changes \nthat can affect macroeconomic stability and financial resilience in the region, and (ii) thematic \nknowledge products (policy briefs and blogs) that respond to short-term risks and medium-term \nvulnerabilities. For the first category, the TA will produce and disseminate a book that will examine \nthe implications of critical changes\u2014such as financial interconnectedness, global financial cycles, \nrapid  introduction  of  financial  technology,  and  development\u2014in  the  global  and  regional \neconomies and financial markets which can affect the macroeconomic stability and financial \nresilience of the ASEAN+3 economies and financial systems. It will discuss the range of policy \npriorities and directions that need to be developed to cope with shifts in the global and regional \nmacroeconomic  and  financial  landscape.  It  will  look  into  and  infer  on  a  suitable  financial \narchitecture for the region, in the future. It will also examine new issues and suitable mitigation \nmeasures that have arisen from severe economic dislocation due to the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. The knowledge products such as the book project will be developed in \nclose  consultation  with  ASEAN+3  regional  mechanism  and  the  ASEAN+3  Macroeconomic \n \n8  The eight DMCs are Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. These \neconomies are selected based on their income level, size, economic vulnerabilities they face, development stage of \ntheir financial sector, and the capacity of their governments to manage shocks to their financial sector. \n9  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n10 Defined by the TA in alignment with operational priority 7: fostering regional cooperation and integration. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nResearch Office (AMRO) and will reflect the policy vision of ASEAN+3. The key findings from the \nbook, particularly the policy priorities and directions, will be shared and disseminated in the \nASEAN+3 economic review and policy dialogue process. Selected country-level consultations will \nbe  held  to  discuss  the  policy  priorities  and  directions.  The  TA  will  also  produce  thematic \nknowledge products such as policy briefs and blogs that will discuss new risks and vulnerabilities \narising  from  trade  tension,  financial  market  volatilities,  technological  disruptions,  drivers  of \ncompetitiveness and productivity growth, ageing, unsustainable urbanization in some DMCs, \npandemics, and climate change. The theme for the policy briefs will be selected based on timely \neconomic and financial issues affecting the region. The thematic knowledge products such as \npolicy briefs will be disseminated regionwide through printed copies distributed to resident \nmissions and regional think tanks; and digital copies distributed using various digital channels \nsuch as Development Asia, blogs, and Facebook among others.12  \n \n7.  Output 2: Electronic library and information platforms established. These will make \ndata, information, and knowledge available to economies, enabling DMCs\u2019 better access to \nrelevant data, leading indicators, information, and knowledge, which would increase their ability \nto respond to shocks, risks, and vulnerabilities.13 The electronic library will contain links to books, \nreports and studies, policy briefs and working papers, conference proceedings, newsletters, and \nbrochures, op-eds, and speeches covering regional financial cooperation; economic and financial \ncrisis; risks and vulnerabilities; financial inclusion, resilience, and stability; and regional contagion \nand spillovers among others.14 On the other hand, the information platform will be more data \nfocused and will contain useful indicators, database reports, and vulnerability tables and heat \nmaps on economic and financial volatilities, risks, and vulnerabilities.15 \n \n8.  Output 3:  Knowledge sharing events for the 8 selected DMCs conducted. Presently, \nADB produces a lot of knowledge, but dissemination is still fragmented. To address this gap, this \noutput  will  aim  to  disseminate  ADB  knowledge  solutions  and  organize  South-South  policy \ndialogue to share country experiences and best practice to the 8 targeted economies.16 The TA \nwill also maximize and synthesize various existing information sources through online catalouging \nof various themes which will be shared to countries and regions through ADB resident missions \nand other regional knowledge hubs. Some gender features are included in this output which \ntargets at least 30% of participants in these knowledge sharing events should be women. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $100,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF-other sources), $900,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Investment Climate  Facilitation  Fund  under  the  Regional \n \n12  The TA may also support development and dissemination of policy briefs on selected DMCs with close regional ties \nwith ASEAN+3 countries. This activity will be based on demand and in partnership with the concerned regional \ndepartments. \n13  Presently, for the 8 selected countries, no data capture mechanism stores useful information and allows the efficient \nretrieval and analysis of data. Most governments are looking for technology they can adopt to their country situation. \n14  The electronic library will use a digital library cataloguing system that can help create an online library on relevant \ntopics including regional financial cooperation, financial inclusion, resilience, and stability\u2015 with open access. It will \nbe located online with access points in ADB resident missions and key knowledge hubs. Preliminary discussions \nwere already held with ADB library staff regarding this catalouging software. \n15  Government provided data supplemented with data from online databases will be the information source for this \nplatform, which will be located in central banks in the eight selected economies. \n16  These events may be done virtually should movement restrictions continue to be in place in light of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic. \n ", "4 \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility17 and administered by ADB, $150,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and \nRegional Cooperation Fund18 and administered by ADB, and $150,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  Civil works, the procurement of large-scale equipment, permanent staffing costs, and the \nhiring of staff consultants are ineligible expenditures under the PRC Poverty Reduction and \nRegional Cooperation Fund and the ROK e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and resource persons; procure goods; \norganize workshops and conferences with partner agencies; and provide staff and/or coordinate \nADB staff for supporting services and participation as resource persons in the workshops and \nconferences. Conforming to One ADB principle, collaboration with regional departments and \nmissions, as well as Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s sector and \nthematic groups will be pursued in the course of TA implementation.
