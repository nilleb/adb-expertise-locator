During  the  2003  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance \n(TA) to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to reform agricultural taxation. In response, the Fact-\nFinding Mission1 visited Beijing on 17\u201321 May 2004, and reached an understanding with MOF \non  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements.2  The  TA  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC\u2019s  agricultural  taxes  are  based  on  1958  regulations  and  constitute  a  dual \nsystem for urban and rural residents. Agricultural taxes are levied according to product price, \nplot area, and average yield per plot area in 5 years. Cash crops are covered by the agricultural \nspecial product tax and animal husbandry tax. Local governments,3 especially of counties and \nvillages, charged fees legally and illegally from farmers for various purposes, often more than \nthe formal tax, especially in poor areas.4 Other tax instruments such as the value-added tax \n(VAT) and income and land-usage taxes, however, are not applied to farmers. Different levels of \ngovernments rely on different tax instruments as their major revenue sources: VAT for the \ncentral Government, corporate taxes for high-level local governments, and agricultural taxes for \nlow-level local governments.5 Many low-level governments have fiscal deficits. The central and \nprovincial governments have revenue transfer systems to help local governments provide basic \nservices and to level the revenue imbalances between local governments. \n \n3.  One of the largest problems of the PRC\u2019s tax system is the disproportionately heavy \nburden on farmers, who are generally poorer than urban residents. The average income of \nfarmers was CNY2,622 in 2003, less than a third of the urban residents\u2019 average, CNY8,472. \nThe income gap between urban and rural residents is widening. During the past 6 years (1997\u2013\n2003), farmers\u2019 average income grew by 3.9% per year, and urban residents\u2019 by 8.6%. Despite \nsuch an uneven income distribution and a growing gap, many rural residents have been levied \nheavy  taxes  and  fees  due  to,  among  other  reasons,  (i)  disproportionate  and  regressive \nagricultural  tax  systems,  (ii)  lack  of  local  governments\u2019  alternative  revenues  sources,  and         \n(iii) high cost of rural public services due to overstaffing and inefficient governance. \n \n 4.  The burden sharing among farmers is not adequate. Because the agricultural tax is \nbased on plot area and average yield and no progressive tax system is applied to farmers, \nsome wealthy farmers enjoy relatively low taxes while low-income farmers have to pay relatively \nhigh taxes. Tax imposition is not adequately correlated with capacity to pay. The tax system \ndiscourages farmers from investing in and enlarging farmland because the tax is based on plot \narea, with no consideration for actual production costs. The agricultural tax system is outdated, \ninadequate for a market economy, unfair to farmers, and a hindrance to agricultural and rural \n                                                 \n1  The Mission comprised M. Tanabe, banking specialist, Governance, Finance and Trade Division of the East and \nCentral Asia Department. The Mission was supported by Peng Longyun of the PRC Resident Mission. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 March 2004. \n3  The PRC has six tiers of organization: the central Government, provinces and autonomous regions (31), cities and \ndistricts (about 300), prefectures (about 2,000), counties (about 40,000), and villages (about 700,000). \n4  In 1999, the total amount of fee charges (excluding illegal ones) by counties and villages reached CNY67 billion, \nwhile the total tax revenue from agricultural taxes was CNY42 billion. \n5  VAT makes up 50% of the central Government\u2019s tax revenue; business and corporate income taxes, 53% of the \nprovincial governments\u2019; and agricultural taxes, 30% of county governments. \n ", " 2  \neconomic development. The Government recognizes the need for an equitable agricultural tax \nsystem and balanced rural public finance. \n \n5.  To lighten the heavy burden on farmers, the Government launched rural tax and fee \nreforms in Anhui Province as a pilot project in 2000, and spread them all over the country in \n2003. The reform program aims, among other things, to (i) abolish most of the fees and restrain \nlocal governments from discretionally charging fees, (ii) replace a part of originally legal fees \nwith an increased agricultural tax rate, and (iii) establish a democratic procedure for deciding fee \ncharges in villages.6 As a result, disorderly fee charges by local governments were restrained in \nmost areas, and the overall tax and fee burden declined by 30\u201340%. However, these measures \nalso reduced the revenues of local governments and aggravated their financial burden. The \nGovernment thus allowed for more revenue transfer from the upper- to lower-level governments.  \n \n6.  In March 2004, the Government announced that it would abolish the agricultural special \nproduct tax (except for tobacco) this year and gradually reduce the agricultural tax to zero by \n2008. As the first step, MOF, Ministry of Agriculture, and state tax administration (STA) jointly \nissued a note in April 2004 to (i) reduce the agricultural tax by 1% all over the country and          \n(ii) nominate several pilot provinces where taxes would be reduced or exempted.7 If the two \ntaxes are abolished, the farmers will benefit. However, the revenue of low-level governments, \nwhich rely heavily on agricultural taxes, will be severely reduced. Low-level governments mainly \nprovide basic public services such as education, public health, and social security. \n \n7.  The Government plans to compensate the local governments by transferring revenues to \nlow-level governments. However, an equitable tax system must also be gradually established \nwhile balancing local governments\u2019 public finance needs since (i) a limited number of wealthy \nfarmers should be levied taxes, (ii) overreliance on revenue transfer will encourage low-level \ngovernments to strive for maximum revenue transfer and discourage expenditure control, and \n(iii) continued revenue transfer may heavily burden the central Government. \n \n8.  Coverage of other tax items8 must be expanded to make taxation equitable. Countries \nwith unified tax systems can make taxation equitable through income and property taxes and \nVAT. To levy these taxes on farmers, tax authorities need to learn, among other things, how to \n(i) calculate the income and value addition from agricultural production, (ii) assess the value of \nfarmlands  and  forests,  and  (iii)  deal  with  farmers  who  are  unable  to  prepare  necessary \ndocuments (e.g., accounting books). To prevent the upturn of the tax burden on poor farmers \nand to encourage investment in agriculture, tax rebates and exemption schemes and other \nfiscal treatments should also be considered. Since the PRC has never had unified urban and \nrural  tax  systems,  the  Government  must  learn  about  international  practices  to  design  tax \npolicies, collection methods, and implementation arrangements and strategies for a unified tax \nsystem. The tax administration system\u2019s capacities should also be strengthened. \n \n9.  Public finance responsibilities of different levels of government must also be defined. To \ndecide such allocations, not only the balance between revenues and expenses but also the \nnature of each tax item, cost for tax collection, and capacities of different tax administration \nauthorities should be considered. Since local government revenue in rural areas may decline as \n                                                 \n6  Under the new rule, villages\u2019 public works (e.g., road construction) that require charging fees need to be approved \nby the majority in villagers\u2019 or village representatives\u2019 meetings.  \n7  According to the note, agricultural tax is fully exempted in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces (in the northeast and \nfamous for grain production), and the tax rate is reduced by 3% in 11 other provinces in 2004. \n8  Sales of self-produced agricultural products by farmers are exempted from VAT, individual income tax does not \ninclude income from agricultural production, and the land-usage tax is applied only in urban areas. ", "                                                                                    3                         \n   \na result of reforms, the revenue transfer system will continue to be important in maintaining and \nimproving basic rural public services. To strategize the reform steps and identify the necessary \ncombination of policy measures, the impacts on rural economies, farmers\u2019 lives, and local \ngovernments\u2019 fiscal conditions must be estimated. \n  \n10.  MOF\u2019s Tax Policy Department (TPD) is responsible for designing tax policies, including \ntax items, bases, rates, and advantages. A working team was established in the State Council \nto lead the rural tax and fee reforms, and the team\u2019s secretariat was established within MOF. \nMOF\u2019s Agricultural Department is responsible for state expenditures on agriculture, and the \nBudget Department for the revenue transfer system. STA is responsible for collecting VAT and \nother  national  taxes  through  its  widespread  local  offices.  Each  province  has  a  local  tax \nadministration (LTA), which collects income, land-usage, and other local taxes. Some LTAs also \ncollect agricultural taxes. In many provinces, local governments (counties and prefectures) \ncollect agricultural taxes. The coordination between these different government departments is \nkey for successful reform of agricultural taxes. \n \n11.  Asian Development Bank's Operations and Strategy. ADB has been helping the \nGovernment improve public administration and fiscal management through several projects \nsuch as Fiscal Management Reforms9 and the Study of Subprovincial Fiscal Relations.10 MOF is \nrequesting the World Bank for advice on rural public finance, focusing on state expenditure. The \nTA for agricultural taxation reform will complement the World Bank\u2019s assistance by focusing on \nthe revenue side of rural public finance. ADB\u2019s operational program in the Country Strategy and \nProgram includes supporting reforms to improve the fiscal transfer system to help poor areas \nand focusing on fiscal reforms in agriculture and rural development. The program emphasizes \nthat  agricultural  growth  and  adjustment  as  well  as  rural  development  are  key  to  reducing \npoverty. \n \nIII.  THE  TEC HNICAL  ASSISTANCE\nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government replace the outdated, distorting, and \ndisproportionate agricultural tax system with modern, fair, neutral, and unified urban and rural \ntax systems that will reduce the burden on poor farmers and encourage rural development. The \nTA will be divided into (i) studies on agricultural tax systems in the PRC and other countries,           \n(ii) recommendations for new tax systems, and (iii) formulation of reform strategies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The scope of TA includes the following: \n \n(i)  Study agricultural tax systems in the PRC and other countries  \n \n(a)  Based on agricultural tax documents, identify key problems in the PRC\u2019s \nagricultural  tax  system,  including  defects  in  implementation  and  the \npossible impact of solving these problems. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002.

Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange \ncost of $305,000 and a local currency cost of $345,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$195,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the local currency \ncost, equivalent to $150,000, by providing counterpart staff, office space, and contingencies. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed TA cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  TPD will be the Executing Agency. A working group will be established, led by the \ndepartment\u2019s top management, as the consultants\u2019 counterpart TPD will provide office space, \ncounterpart staff, in-city transportation, and other services to the consultants, and will arrange \ntheir appointments with agencies and organizations.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  a  total  of  17  person-months\u2019  services  of  consultants:  three \ninternational for 7 person-months, and three domestic for 10 person-months. The international \nconsultants will include an agricultural tax policy specialist and economist, a tax administration \nspecialist, and a rural development planner and sociologist. Domestic consultants will have the \nsame expertise. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. They will be \nrecruited through their firms, selected under the quality- and cost-based selection method using \nthe  simplified  technical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month after they start working, \n(ii) two interim reports within 5 and 8 months, (iii) a draft final report before the contract ends, \nand (iv) the final report after incorporating TPD\u2019s and ADB's comments. All reports will be in \nEnglish and Chinese. The TA will start in November 2004 and be completed in November 2005.

Outputs \n1.  The  expected  output  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  a  comprehensive  report \nrecommending agricultural tax system reform. The report will contain (i) a domestic study on the \nagricultural  tax  system,  (ii)  an  international  study  on  agricultural  tax  systems,                        \n(iii) recommendations for a new tax system, (iv) an analysis of the impacts of the transformation \nto the new tax system, and (v) a strategy for shifting to the new tax system. \n \n1.  Domestic Study on the Agricultural Tax System \n2.  To clarify the reform\u2019s departure point and identify the TA issues, recent changes and \nthe problems of the agricultural tax system in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) must be \nunderstood. Researches in this area should be fully used. The consultants will deepen the \nresearch to prepare policy recommendations and an implementation strategy by, among other \nthings, sending questionnaires to local governments and conducting field research in selected \nregions. This part of the report will identify key issues, including the following: \n \n(i)  current agricultural tax regulations, and changes in regulations under the rural tax \nand fee reforms; \n \n(ii)  influences  of  past  and  current  agricultural  tax  systems  on  farmers\u2019  income \ngeneration activities and living standards, and rural growth; \n \n(iii)  current systems for other taxes, including income and property taxes, and value-\nadded tax (VAT); \n \n(iv)  fiscal, public finance balance, and distributive justice aspects of the agricultural \ntax system; \n \n(v)  progress of rural tax and fee reforms and lessons learned; \n \n(vi)  staffing and operational efficiencies of local governments and their influence on \nfiscal conditions and supply of public services; and \n \n(vii)  methods and practices of tax collection, and division of labor between different \ngovernment authorities, especially in rural areas. \n \n2.
