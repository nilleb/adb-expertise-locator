INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Indonesia has requested technical assistance (TA) for developing a\nstrategy to separate public service obligations (PSOs) from commercially viable operations in\nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs). This TA will (i) help identify the PSOs of SOEs; (ii) establish\ntheir cost to the SOEs; (iii) develop proposals for their commercialization; and, in case this is not\npossible, (iv) separate PSOs from commercial operations, which is a key condition for the\nsuccessful restructuring and privatization of SOEs.  Originally, the TA was to be attached to the\nproposed State-Owned Enterprises Governance and Privatization Program (SOEGPP)1 loan.\nHowever,  the  processing  of  the  loan  has  been  delayed  due  to  frequent  changes  in\nadministration and the somewhat difficult overall domestic environment for processing policy-\nbased loans. Since there is a need to actively pursue further reforms in the SOE sector, it is\nadvantageous  to  process  the  TA  on  a  stand  alone  basis.  The  TA  will  build  on  the  work\nundertaken under a previous successful TA,2 and another TA3 that developed a strategy for\nrestructuring public services, including those provided by SOEs. The Fact-Finding Mission,\nfielded  on  11-19  April  1999,  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s\nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements.4 The TA framework is in\nAppendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Although established to serve economic and social goals, SOEs in Indonesia have been\ninefficient in meeting them. SOEs have provided social services and contributed to regional\ndevelopment objectives at considerable cost to society. Indiscriminate subsidies to SOEs and\npolicies to protect them from competition have resulted in huge economic and financial losses.\nIn several cases, vested interests have manipulated the SOEs to secure illegal payoffs through\ncorruption and collusion or outright fraud. The neglect of governance in the Government\u2019s\nsphere of direct influence has encouraged violation of rules and regulations in the private sector,\nto the detriment of creditors and minority shareholders.\n3. Since  the  onset  of  the  economic  crisis  in  1997,  the  Government  has  adopted\nprivatization as a cornerstone of its industrial strategy with a view to accelerate economic\nliberalization and generate revenues for a resource-strapped budget burdened with the costs of\nbank  recapitalization.  However,  poor  planning,  weak  public  relations,  and  opposition  from\nvested political and bureaucratic interests have delayed privatization. The continued provision of\nPSOs  by  SOEs  to  alleviate  social  dislocation  during  the  crisis  years  has  delayed  their\nprivatization.  The  Government  took  some  time  to  develop  its  capacity  to  deal  with  SOE\nrestructuring and privatization as a crucial part of crisis management and a master plan for SOE\nreform was announced in June 2000.  In support of the master plan, the Government has\nimplemented a corporate governance policy to align management incentives with shareholder\nobjectives and interests. The Government also plans to financially and operationally restructure\nviable  SOEs  and  liquidate  nonviable  ones,  while  forging  ahead  with  the  privatization  of\ncommercially successful enterprises.5 Resolution of problems with PSOs is a key to SOE\nreform.\n                  \n1 The SOEGPP is being processed for approval in 2001. \n2  TA 3149-INO: Corporate Governance and Enterprise Restructuring, for $2.47 million, approved on 29 December\n1998.\n3  TA 3233-INO: Strategy for Restructuring Public Services, for $488,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\n4  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2000.\n5  These activities will be supported by a proposed TA, Corporate Restructuring and Privatization, for $2.6 million.", "2\n4. Systematic privatization of SOEs had commenced in the 1990s but failed to gather\nmomentum.  The  first  phase  of  privatization,  from  October  1994  to  December 1996,  which\npreceded the economic crisis, involved the sale on domestic and international capital markets of\nminority stakes, ranging from 10 to 35 percent, in six of Indonesia\u2019s largest SOEs.6 The Ministry\nof Finance (MOF) was the legal owner of SOEs and, in principle, was supposed to exercise its\ncontrol  rights  by  setting  up  specific  performance  targets  for  SOE  operations  and  issuing\nguidelines  for  dividends.  In  practice,  the  power  of  SOE  management,  administration,  and\nsupervision rested with the respective sector ministries. This institutional arrangement created\nconfusion between MOF and the sector ministries concerning the oversight of SOEs. The sector\nministries frequently interfered in the commercial operations of SOEs and burdened them with\nPSOs in pursuit of regional or social development objectives, irrespective of their commercial\nviability.\n5. The second phase of SOE reform, triggered by the economic crisis, started in early\n1998, when the Government changed the institutional arrangement for the oversight of SOEs.\nAs a first step, presidential decrees 12 and 13 transferred the power of SOE management,\nadministration, and supervision from the sector ministries to MOF. SOEs were delinked from the\nadministrative control of sector ministries to remove their interference in SOEs\u2019 commercial\noperations and to revert them to their primary function of sector policymaking, regulation, and\nsupply  of  public  goods.  In  May  1998,  presidential  decrees  50  and  64 transferred  the\nmanagement responsibility of SOEs from MOF to the newly established Ministry of State-\nOwned Enterprises (MSOE), to provide SOEs with more managerial autonomy. In December\n1999, four state-owned banks and 14 financial institutions were transferred from MSOE back to\nMOF. To improve efficiency of public administration and to rationalize administration of SOEs,\nMSOE was dissolved on 26 August 2000, and oversight of the 130 SOEs was transferred to the\nDirectorate General for SOEs (DG BUMN) in MOF.7 On 10 August 2001, the new President\nreversed the decision and reestablished MSOE.\n6. These changes have streamlined institutional arrangements for SOEs. MOF continues to\noversee the financial aspects of SOEs, including share custody, financial audits, and receipt of\ndividends and revenues from the sale of shares. All other property rights are now exercised by\nMSOE:  (i)  dividend  payments;  (ii)  appointment  and  termination  of  contracts  of  SOE\ncommissioners and directors; (iii) merger, consolidation, sale, and liquidation of SOEs; and\n(iv) granting  of  Government  guarantees  for  SOE  debt.  However,  the  process  of  SOE\nrestructuring  and  privatization  will  continue  to  require  close  interdepartmental  coordination\nbetween MSOE and the sector ministries, particularly in PSO-related matters. The Government\nhas therefore established the minister-level Privatization Consultative Committee to coordinate\nthe reform process.\n7. The Government has often used SOEs to provide public and merit goods and services\nranging from transportation in remote areas to vocational education and health care. SOEs are\nalso entrusted with PSOs such as reforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan, supply of vaccines\nat below cost prices to the public health system, maintenance of unprofitable but socially\ndesirable  air  and  shipping  services,  and  operation  of  remote  air  and  seaports.  Political\ninterference in pricing and inadequate accountability in SOEs has resulted in inefficient delivery\nof  these  services.  They  are  either  cross-subsidized  by  SOEs\u2019  profitable  business  units  or\nsubsidized by the Government. This practice diverts resources from profitable activities, lowers\n                  \n6 PT Telkom, PT Indosat, PT Semen Gresik, PT Tambang Timah, PT Amka Tambang, and PT Bank Negara\nIndonesia.\n7 Presidential Decree 89 of 10 October 2000.", "3\noverall returns and impairs growth potential of SOEs, while eliminating incentives for efficient\nprovision  of  PSOs.  To  overcome  these  inefficiencies,  PSOs  should  be  contracted  out\ntransparently to ensure the lowest cost by the service provider. Pure public goods and services,\nshould  be  provided  free  by  government  departments  and  agencies.  The  Government  has\ncorrected some tariff and other fiscal distortions as part of the structural adjustment program,\nbut subsidies and cross-subsidies within SOEs continue. To increase transparency, prepare\nthem for eventual privatization and achieve full management accountability for commercial\noperations, the Government needs to separate PSOs from commercial activities in SOEs.\nOtherwise, SOEs will not achieve a sufficient profitability to attract private investors.\n8. To separate PSOs from the commercial activities of SOEs, MSOE will (i) identify PSOs\nin all SOEs, (ii) estimate PSO costs and social (including environmental) impact for 15 SOEs,\nand (iii) develop rules and regulations for contracting such services through competitive bidding\nto allow participation by private companies. The objective is to establish a transparent process\nwith due consultation of all stakeholders. A precondition for its achievement is to introduce cost\naccounting in the SOEs covered by the program, helping not only to quantify the costs of\nproviding PSOs, but also to allow estimation of the value of SOE\u2019s commercial operations, thus\nfacilitating privatization.\n9. MSOE will cooperate closely with relevant sector ministries to introduce necessary rules\nand regulations, required to support the contracting out of the provision of selected PSOs to the\nmost competitive bidder, which may or may not be the SOE that previously provided the\nservices.  The  contracting  process  will  require  compliance  with  environmental  legislation  in\ntechnical specifications.\n10. International experience has demonstrated that PSOs can be most efficiently provided in\na competitive environment where they are estimated and packaged as concessions or service\ncontracts and offered in public tender to the most competitive bidder. This process will allow the\nGovernment  to  accurately  measure  the  cost  of  PSOs  and  ensure  that  their  provision  is\ncontracted to the most efficient supplier. It will also facilitate the creation of a transparent system\nof (i) subsidies for socially desirable, but economically nonviable, services whose cost is fully\nquantifiable and can be financed directly from the Government budget; and (ii) bidding for the\nprovision of such services by private companies through predefined and transparent rules and\nprocedures.\n11. The Government, with a TA financed by the ADB (footnote 2), has so far identified 15\nSOEs  with  significant  PSOs  (Appendix  2).  Among  them  are  Indonesia\u2019s  ports,  which  are\noperated by four SOEs (PT Pelindo I to IV), each with one potentially profitable port combined\nwith 8-15 smaller unprofitable regional ports. Similarly, all airports are operated by two SOEs\n(PT Angkasa Pura I and II). Each of these has a profitable international airport (Jakarta and\nDenpasar) packaged with a set of loss-making regional airports. Privatization options for these\nsix SOEs are to sell them entirely, which involves the risk that the new owners might close down\nthe  loss-making  regional  operations  later,  with  unacceptable  political  and  socioeconomic\nconsequences.  Another  option,  currently  pursued  by  the  Government  for  the  airports  and\nalready applied to the Jakarta and Surabaya container terminals, is to separate the profitable\noperations from the SOE and either sell them to private operators or form joint ventures with\nprivate investors to operate them separately. This option has the risk that the SOEs will no\nlonger generate sufficient profits to cross-subsidize the loss-making ports and airports, with\nrapid deterioration of operational assets and accumulation of debt in these as a consequence. A\nthird possibility, to be pursued under the TA, is to separate the loss-making operations, often\nPSOs, from the commercial operations, and find alternative delivery systems for the loss-", "4\nmaking operations, including transparent subsidization. The commercial operations can thus be\nsold without endangering the future provision of PSOs.\n12. Under the Government\u2019s economic recovery program, supported by IMF, World Bank,\nand ADB, MOF was tasked with formulating recommendations to restructure public services.\nThe Government agreed to undertake a comprehensive study of the public services under\nADB\u2019s  Financial  Governance  Reform:  Sector  Development  Program.8  ADB  provided  TA\n(footnote 3) for restructuring public services, including PSOs of SOEs, which recommended\nreforms entailing rationalization of tariffs and financial devolution, incorporation of public service\nproviders currently part of Government departments, and privatization modes ranging from\nlicensing to outright divestment. Due to its severe budgetary constraints, the Government gives\npriority  to  separation  of  PSOs  from  the  commercial  activities  of  SOEs  to  improve  their\nprivatization prospects. Building on the earlier background work undertaken by ADB, this TA will\nestimate  the  financial  burden  on  SOEs  from  PSOs  and  develop  proposals  for  their\ncommercialization or separation from commercial operations of SOEs.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n13. The objective of this TA is to identify and separate PSOs from SOEs, and to identify\nalternative, more efficient provision mechanisms, including opening of business opportunities for\nprivate sector companies to provide PSOs. As private companies enter into contracts to supply\nPSOs previously exclusively supplied by SOEs, the latter\u2019s profitability would improve as they\neither terminate supply of PSOs or are adequately compensated for continued provision of\nPSOs.\nB.  Scope\n14. The TA will conduct a survey of SOEs, including interviews with management and\nofficials in sector ministries, to identify PSOs, including the (i) production of goods and services\nand their supply at below cost, (ii) loss incurred from implementing public sector infrastructure\nprojects as directed by Government at below cost prices, (iii) provision of services without\ncompensation, and (iv) provision of social services such as education and health. The TA will\nassess the impact of PSOs on the financial performance of selected SOEs. It will also assess\nwhether  the  accounting  systems  of  SOEs  are  capable  of  allocating  their  general  cost\ncomponents  such  as  capital  costs,  licenses,  and  overhead  costs  to  individual  operational\nactivities, and, in case of inadequate systems, help improve them or provide estimates for the\ntrue costs of providing PSOs. The TA will establish and implement measures to separate PSOs\nfrom commercially viable activities of SOEs, which may include (i) establishing separate profit\ncenters; (ii) creating a subsidiary or an independent companies; or (iii) returning the activities to\nthe relevant government department or a provincial authority. The TA will require outlining\nPSOs\u2019  expected  (i)  operations,  (ii)  company  operational  structure,  and  (iii)  proposed  initial\nfinancial structure. The TA will define the rules and regulations for tendering the supply of PSOs\nto private companies, and, for a limited number of SOEs with PSOs, to be determined by ADB\nin consultation with the Executing Agency and consultants after the midterm report, estimate\nthese regulations\u2019 financial impact on the SOEs and fiscal impact on the budget.\n                  \n8 Loan 1618-INO: Financial Governance Reform: Sector Development Program, for $1400.000 million, approved on\n25 June 1998.", "5\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1.25 million equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange  cost  of  $690,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $560,000.  The  Government  has\nrequested ADB to finance $1.00 million equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost\nand $310,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant\nbasis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF), funded by the Government of\nJapan. The Government will provide $250,000 equivalent in the form of counterpart staff, office\nfacilities, and workshops (Appendix 3).\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. MSOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  International  consultants  (including  individual\nconsultants) will provide 21 person-months of consulting services. The services will be in the\nareas of financial analysis and modeling, cost accounting, industrial economics, and public\nfinance. Domestic consultants will provide 32 person-months of consulting services in the areas\nof  financial  analysis,  cost  accounting,  and  public  finance.  The  international  and  domestic\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The outline terms of reference for the consultants\nare in Appendix 4. The TA will commence in November 2001 and be completed by December\n2002. The consultants will submit an inception report four weeks after TA commencement, an\ninterim report after four months, and a final report after seven months.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision  of  technical  assistance  on  a  grant  basis  to  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of\nIndonesia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000, for Commercialization of\nPublic Service Obligations, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\n       \nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Indicators Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nand Targets\nGoal\n\u2022 Secure and improve public \u2022 Supply by private \u2022 Regular reports MSOE;

The  consultants  will  develop  time-phased  action  plans  for  the  separation  of  public\nservice obligations (PSOs) from the commercial operations of selected state-owned enterprises\n(SOEs). PSOs include the (i) production of goods and services and their mandatory supply at\nbelow cost, (ii) contracting of public sector infrastructure projects at below cost prices, (iii)\nprovision  of  services  without  compensation,  and  (iv)  provision  of  social  services  such  as\neducation and health for nonemployees. After surveying the SOE portfolio under the supervision\nof the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (MSOE), consultants, together with MSOE, will\nselect 10 SOEs best suited to be model cases and easily copied by other SOEs.\n2. PSOs  are  the  non-commercial  programs  and  activities  of  SOEs  designed  to  meet\ncommunity and social objectives determined by the Government. The following three criteria are\nsuggested as a basis for defining PSOs: (i) the PSO is provided for some identifiable community\nor social benefit; (ii) the PSO is the result of a specific government directive to a SOE regarding\nthe provision of the PSO and the conditions (e.g. price) of its supply; and (iii) the PSO would not\nbe supplied, or would not be supplied on the same conditions by the SOE, if it were acting\nprimarily in its own commercial interest. Instances of \u201cgood corporate citizenship\u201d, such as\nsponsorship are not included as PSOs.\n3. The consultants are required to assess whether the avoidable cost approach is the\nappropriate basis to estimate the cost of PSO provision and for negotiations with Government\nabout adequate levels of subsidization. The principle is to establish all the costs that would be\navoided if the PSOs were not carried out. The avoidable cost approach identifies all costs\nassociated  with  providing  an  additional  or  incremental  range  of  output,  inclusive,  where\nappropriate, of capital costs. In principle, this will include all capital costs resulting from a\ngovernment requirement to provide a PSO, including those costs which may subsist after a PSO\nhas been discontinued. This approach shall only be applied if it ensures that all the relevant\ncosts of providing the specific PSO are recognized, and therefore is an appropriate identification\nof the economic costs associated with PSO delivery.\nA.  Public Finance Expert and Team Leader (international, 7 person\u2013months)\n4. The public finance expert will lead the regulation team and deliver the terms of reference\noutlined in para. 7. The team leader will perform the following additional tasks:\n(i)  Review previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance for public service\nreform,  in  particular  the  output  from  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  project,\n\u201cStrategy for Restructuring Public Services\u201d.1\n(ii)  In cooperation with MSOE and the team of consultants for the TA on SOE\nprivatization and restructuring,2 identify SOEs to be included in the survey.\n(iii)  Supervise the design and implementation of the survey.\n(iv)  Identify  SOEs  with  PSOs  to  be  separated  from  commercial  operations,  and\nsupervise the assessment of the accounting system.\n(v)  Supervise and participate in the design of rules for tendering the supply of PSOs.\n(vi)  Prepare and supervise preparation of reports as outlined in para. 6.\n                                                          \n1  TA 3233-INO: Strategy for Restructuring Public Services, for $488,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\n2 Proposed TA to the Republic of Indonesia for privatization and restructuring of state-owned enterprises, processed\nparallel to this TA.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 16)", "12\nAppendix 4, page 2\n(vii)  Undertake  other  assignments  agreed  to  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and\nconsultants from time to time, in pursuit of the TA objective.\n(viii)  Coordinate and supervise the work of the international and domestic consultants.\n(ix)  Liaise with the MSOE, other relevant ministries, and SOEs.\nB. Survey Experts (international, 2 person-months; domestic, 6 person\u2013months)\n5. The team of industry economists will work closely with the team of accountants or can\nbe part of the accounting team. The objective is to identify three classes of PSOs. The first class\n(Class I) of PSOs have clear characteristics of public goods and services and have to be\nsupplied by government authorities. Examples could be the management of natural parks or\nmarine reserve areas which involves law enforcement duties. The second class (Class II) of\nPSOs are those which, in the long-term could be outsourced to the private sector. However, due\nto political or economic circumstances the respective SOE is the only potential supplier in the\nnear-term. Examples are the supply of traffic services in the outer reaches of the archipelago.\nThe third class (Class III) comprises PSOs which can be outsourced to the private sector if an\nefficient system of subsidization can be implemented. Examples are the management of smaller\nports and airports. The survey experts tasks will include but not limited to the following:\n(i)  Prepare  the  survey  of  SOEs  to  identify  PSOs  in  cooperation  with  the  team\nleader, accounting team, and team of consultants working on Privatization and\nRestructuring SOE.\n(ii)  Assess (based on interviews with SOE management as well as staff in the\nrelevant ministries) all selected SOEs to identify all PSOs and their beneficiaries.\nProvide first assessment of the impact of the PSOs on the financial performance\nof  each  SOE.  The  PSOs  are  to  include  regularly  provided  services  and\noccasional delivery of projects at a price below cost (directed work).\n(iii)  Prepare a report of survey findings.\nB.  Accounting Team ( international, 6 person-months; domestic, 16 person\u2013months)\n6. The team of accountants and/or financial analysts will work closely with the regulation\nteam  as  well  as  with  the  team  of  consultants  fielded  under  the  TA  Privatization  and\nRestructuring of SOEs. The team\u2019s tasks will include but not be limited to the following:\n(i)  Help develop the survey (see para. 5).\n(ii)  Assess the accounting system in at least 10 SOEs, in particular cost accounting,\nto identify the true costs of the delivery of public services.\n(iii)  Help SOEs with inadequate accounting systems establish a system allowing a\ntrue allocation of all costs to each business within each SOE.\n(iv)  Provide sets of financial accounts that clearly separate the supply of PSOs from\nthe commercial operations in terms of balance sheet, profit-and-loss statement,\nand cash-flow statement.\n(v)  Identify the economic costs and revenues of delivering the public services by\napplying the avoidable cost approach;\n(vi)  Help SOEs\u2019 management prepare statements of corporate intent (SCIs) clearly\nidentifying  the  PSOs,  their  rationale,  objectives  and  beneficiaries.  The  SCIs\nshould  assess  PSO  impact  on  the  SOEs\u2019  financial  performance  and  outline\nalternative delivery options.\n(vii)  Prepare a report of findings.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 16)", "13\nAppendix 4, page 3\nC.  Public  Finance  Experts  and  Regulation  Team  (international,  6  person-months;\ndomestic, 10 person\u2013months)\n7. The tasks of the team of public finance economists will include but not be limited to the\nfollowing:\n(i)  Help develop the survey (para. 5).\n(ii)  For  Class  I  type  of  PSOs  develop  recommendations  as  to  their  continuing\nefficient supply as a public good or public service. The recommendation will\ninclude organizational changes in the SOEs as well as the relevant governmental\ndepartment,  and  will  enhance  the  transparency,  accountability  and  equity\naspects of PSO provision by clearly identifying the costs to the community of\nproviding the social and community programs. Estimate the fiscal impact of the\nrecommendation.\n(iii)  For Class II type of PSOs define the rules and regulations for costing, funding,\nmonitoring, external consultation and implementation of a transparent and cost\nefficient  subsidy  system  for  the  continuous  supply  of  PSOs  by  SOEs.  If\nadequate,  give  due  consideration  for  the  current  decentralization  process,\nincluding the appropriate ownership structure. For a selected number of such\nPSOs, estimate the fiscal impact of implementing these rules and regulations.\n(iv)  For Class III type of PSOs define the rules and regulations for tendering the\nsupply of PSOs under a transparent and cost efficient subsidization system by\neither public or private enterprises, with due consideration for decentralization\nwhere appropriate. For a selected number of such PSOs, estimate the fiscal\nimpact of implementing these rules and regulations.\n(v)  Implement these new systems for delivery of PSOs in a few cases covering all\nthree types.\n(vi)  Prepare a report of findings.\nD.  Reporting\n8. The team leader will prepare an inception report within four weeks of commencement of\ntheir services, providing a time-bound work program. In addition to any reports required for the\nindividual components, the following reports will be required for the overall TA: (i) an interim\nreport to be submitted four months after the commencement of consulting services; and (ii) a\nfinal report to be submitted by the end of the seventh month, incorporating the comments of\nADB and the Government on the draft final report which will have been submitted three weeks\nearlier. The final report will include a draft policy statement on the treatment of PSOs.\nF. Workshops\n9. The  consultants  will  conduct  at  least  two  workshops  to  present  the  results  of  the\nconsultants\u2019 assignment to officials from line ministries and MSOE, as well as for SOE staff, and\nrepresentatives of international development agencies.\nG.  Domestic Consultants\n10. The domestic consultants will work within the TOR provided above. The team leader will\nbe responsible to assign individual and specific TOR.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 16)"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011010145229", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R170-01TA.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011012154707+08'00'"}}
