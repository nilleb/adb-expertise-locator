INTRODUCTION \n1.  On 16 January 2001, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved its policy on water.1 This followed extensive consultations with stakeholders over \nseveral years. In addition to promoting national water sector reforms, integrated water resources \nmanagement, and better water services for the poor, the policy commits ADB to regional and \nsubregional cooperation by assisting with water sector assessments and exchange of data, \nenhancing awareness and understanding of the water sector issues and needs of each country, \nand  supporting  water  partnerships  in  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  On \n10 December 2001, ADB\u2019s Board approved the establishment of the Cooperation Fund for the \nWater Sector (the Fund). The Fund is a multi-agency umbrella facility to promote effective water \nmanagement policies and practices at the regional, subregional, and country levels and thereby \nto catalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the Asia and Pacific region. The Fund \nwill finance a coherent program of activities (the Program) designed to add value to the water \nprojects carried out by ADB\u2019s regional departments. The activities will increase the synergy in \nADB\u2019s water sector operations as a whole through better awareness, knowledge management, \ncapacity building to support generic sector reforms, pilot demonstration, regional cooperation, \nand monitoring and coordination. The Government of the Netherlands has made an initial \ncontribution of $4 million to the Fund to start the Program in 2002. Program activities to be \nfinanced from this contribution have been identified by ADB staff in consultation with water \nsector officials and experts in the region, and have been prioritized for inclusion in the Program \nby the concerned water sector directors in ADB\u2019s regional departments and in the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department (RSDD). The technical assistance (TA) framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s water policy is premised on the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s urgent need to formulate \nand implement integrated, cross-sector approaches to water management and development. It \nseeks to promote the concept of water as a socially vital economic good that needs increasingly \ncareful management to sustain equitable economic growth and to reduce poverty. Improving \nwater services for the poor and conserving water resources in the region through a participatory \napproach are at the heart of the policy. The water policy focuses on seven priorities that are \nconsistent with those adopted by the second World Water Forum: (i) promoting a national focus \non water sector reform, (ii) fostering the integrated management of water resources in river \nbasins,  (iii)  improving  and  expanding  the  delivery  of  water  services,  (iv) fostering  the \nconservation of water and increasing water efficiencies, (v) promoting regional cooperation and \nincreasing the mutually beneficial use of shared water resources within and between countries, \n(vi) facilitating the exchange of water sector information and experience, and (vii) improving \nwater governance.  \n \n3.  The Board paper establishing the Fund identified three areas of priority assistance in the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy and the national water policies in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. First, DMCs need support in (i) undertaking or updating water sector assessments with \nthe participation of stakeholders, as the basis for national water action agendas; (ii) designing \nand implementing critical water sector reforms; and (iii) demonstrating these reforms through \npilot initiatives at the appropriate levels. The establishment of national and regional water \npartnerships and river basin organizations can help to broaden stakeholder participation and \ncatalyze these water reform activities. Second, ADB needs to revise its business processes and \nstrengthen its internal capacity to target the water sector more holistically in its operations with \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.  Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 January 2002.  ", "2        \ngreater synergy. This requires (i) raising awareness and building capacity among ADB staff at \nheadquarters and in resident missions; (ii) developing ADB\u2019s water focal point; (iii) establishing \nsystematic knowledge management about water policies, trends, and reforms in the region; \n(iv) strengthening  water  sector  collaboration  with  development  partners;  and  (v)  supporting \npolicy dialogue and the preparation and implementation of TA and loan projects reflecting the \nwater policies of ADB and its DMCs. Third, regional cooperation needs to be strengthened to \n(i) raise  awareness  of  important  water  issues,  trends,  and  policies;  (ii) increase  the \nunderstanding of critical themes in water sector reform through research and capacity building; \n(iii) optimize the use of available resources among DMCs and development partners in the \nsector; and (iv) catalyze investments in integrated water resources management and in better \nwater services, particularly for the poor. Private sector investment needs to be facilitated, and \nnetworking stimulated among women\u2019s groups, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), media, \nthe professional and research community, and other water sector initiatives.  \n \n4.  In strengthening regional cooperation among DMCs and ADB in the water sector, the \ninitial activities under the Program will take full advantage of the ongoing preparations for the \nthird World Water Forum (WWF), which will be held in Kyoto, Japan, in March 2003. ADB\u2019s \nwater sector operations are highly relevant to the themes of the third WWF, and ADB has \nalready taken a leading role in organizing several thematic sessions in close collaboration with \nits  development  partners.  These  themes  include  (i)  water  and  poverty,  (ii)  water  in  cities, \n(iii) water  in  small  island  countries,  (iv)  regional  cooperation  for  shared  water  resources \nmanagement, and (v) flood management. Concurrently, the WWF preparations offer ADB an \nexcellent opportunity to focus on critical water and poverty issues and their solutions in the Asia \nand Pacific region, and to incorporate lessons learned into ADB\u2019s water projects. ADB will use \nthe opportunity of the third WWF to raise awareness among water sector decision makers, the \nmedia, and the public at large, including youth and children, about critical water issues and \ninitiatives, and to promote effective water policies, practices, and investments. The preparations \nfor the third WWF will also help ADB to consult with its DMCs on the selected themes, facilitate \nthe  exchange  of  sector  reform  experience,  and  build  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  base  through \ncomparative and thematic studies and regional consultations.  Collaboration with development \npartners will be strengthened in the process, including with other multilateral development \nbanks, bilateral funding agencies, research institutions, NGOs, and the media.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The proposed TA will start the Program to promote effective water management policies \nand  practices  at  regional,  subregional,  and  country  levels  and  thereby  catalyze  the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the Asia and Pacific region, including within ADB itself. \nThe activities under the Program aim to add value to, and increase the synergy, in ADB\u2019s water \nsector  operations  through  better  awareness,  knowledge  management,  capacity  building  to \nsupport generic sector reforms, pilot demonstration, regional cooperation, and monitoring and \ncoordination.  Poverty  reduction  is  an  objective  crosscutting  the  proposed  activities.  The \nproposed Program activities are targeted at a range of stakeholders in the region, including \npolicy makers, planners, ADB\u2019s decision makers, civil society organizations, the media, the \npublic at large, ADB staff, and development partners.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The proposed TA comprises the following activities under the six approved categories of \nthe Program, to increase synergy in ADB\u2019s water sector operations.  \n ", "  3\n \n7.  Promotion and Public Awareness. A water awareness program will be developed to \ndisseminate ADB\u2019s water policy, increase public awareness and stakeholder dialogue on water \nreform issues, educate youth about the water crisis, improve press coverage of water issues, \nand support community-level water education pilot projects. The program will develop specific \nmessages for each target audience (para. 4) and will use a variety of media including a water \nwebsite, multimedia productions, publicity materials, public service announcements, a quarterly \nnewsletter, print publications, media relations, water goodwill ambassadors, exhibitions, and \npilot community water education activities implemented through NGOs. The first phase of the \nwater awareness program will include support for ADB\u2019s contributions to the third WWF. \n \n8.  Knowledge Base and Capacity Building. A water information system  will be designed \nand developed for use by ADB and DMC staff to support ADB\u2019s water operations. The system \nwill provide water sector statistics by DMC, including national water sector profiles for selected \nDMCs, a compilation of useful practices in key water sector reform topics, and links to other \nwater knowledge centers outside ADB. The system will be developed using both the internet as \nwell as an intranet for ADB and DMC staff use. Comparative analysis of water sector reforms in \nthe region will be initiated with (i) the analysis of water issues in 20 cities in the region, building \non the findings of ADB\u2019s water utility data books, and in preparation for the Water in Cities \ntheme of the third WWF; and (ii) a study on water governance, involving the establishment and \nperformance  of  water  sector  apex  bodies,  water  policies,  water  laws,  water  sector  action \nagendas, river basin organizations, and methodologies to assess the capacity and performance \nof water sector agencies. \n  \n9.  A  water  sector  capacity  building  program  will  be  developed  to  develop  core \ncompetencies in DMCs and ADB to implement water policy reforms. Based on the outcome of \nassessments of capacity and training needs, a training program will be designed involving \ntraining workshops, training courses, exchange visits between DMCs on priority water sector \nreform topics, support for ADB\u2019s water focal point, and the development of a regional research \nand capacity building network in accordance with the water policy. The Fund will support needs \nassessments and preparation of the capacity building program, and the implementation of \nselected cross-cutting and regional training activities, while the capacity building activities within \nDMCs will generally be implemented by ADB\u2019s regional departments through regular country \nassistance operations.  \n \n10.  Pilot  Demonstration.  Water  project  teams  in  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  will  be \nsupported to develop new approaches in water policy and sector reform during country strategy \nformulation and project preparation and implementation. Innovative local initiatives implemented \nby NGOs will also be supported on a selective basis, where possible through the Global Water \nPartnership\u2019s (GWP) regional technical advisory committees. The design will also be initiated of \na  more  systematic  water  sector  policy  dialogue  process  between  ADB  and  the  DMCs, \nsupported by first trials in selected DMCs, and training for ADB and DMC staff concerned. \n \n11.  Water  Partnerships.  Several  activities  will  be  undertaken  to  initiate  or  strengthen \nnational and regional water partnerships. The comparative study on water issues in 20 cities in \nthe region (para. 8) will help to establish a regional partnership of water utilities. The countries of \nthe lower Mekong River basin will be assisted in the development of a flood management \npartnership in collaboration with the Mekong River Commission and the Royal Netherlands \nEmbassy in Hanoi. In the Pacific subregion, an existing partnership of atoll island countries \naffected by climate change and the rise in sea level, chaired by the President of Kiribati, will be \nsupported through a pilot study on national water resources assessment and coastal zone \nplanning. The establishment of national water partnerships will be supported in selected DMCs, \nincluding Indonesia and Philippines, through subregional water partnerships including GWP\u2019s \nregional  technical  advisory  committees.  The  development  of  new  subregional  water ", "4        \npartnerships will be supported in collaboration with GWP, in the Pacific subregion and in Central \nAsia in connection with the preparations for the third WWF and ADB\u2019s institutional framework for \nregional cooperation in Central Asia. \n \n12.  Regional Events and Initiatives. Support will be provided for the organization of the \nthird WWF, including financing selected participants from DMCs to the WWF and its preparatory \nregional consultations; support for the ministerial meeting, the funding agencies panel, and the \nhigh-level working group on water sector financing; and associated media events. A stakeholder \nforum will be organized at ADB headquarters, tentatively at the end of May 2002, on water \nservices for the poor to improve the dialogue on this subject among the private sector, NGOs, \ntrade  unions,  and  other  interested  stakeholders.  A  water  week  will  be  organized  at  ADB \nheadquarters, tentatively in early December 2002, to convene ADB water staff and interested \nwater  staff  from  DMCs  and  development  partners  to  review  policies,  collaboration,  and \ninnovative practices, and to exchange information and experience. \n \n13.  Program  Coordination,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation.  A  monitoring  system  will  be \nestablished for the Program of activities financed from the Fund, covering inputs, outputs, \noutcomes, and financial management. An evaluation system for the Program and ADB\u2019s water \npolicy implementation will also be designed, to assess development impact. An annual review of \nthe Program\u2019s activities will also be organized. The water sector focal point in RSDD will be \nsupported to undertake the coordination and monitoring of the Program. Exchange visits will be \nundertaken with the World Bank\u2019s water partnership program and with similar initiatives of other \ndevelopment partners to ensure coordination and to facilitate joint activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $4.00 million, will be financed by the Fund through \nthe channel financing facility of the Government of the Netherlands, and administered by ADB.3  \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented by ADB. The Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social \nSector  Division  (RSAN)  of  RSDD,  in  association  with  concerned  divisions  in  the  regional \ndepartments, will be responsible for all TA activities. The water sector committee established \nunder ADB\u2019s revised business processes will serve as the TA team. The lead water resources \nspecialist of RSAN will coordinate the team\u2019s activities. The implementation of TA activities may \nbe delegated to operational divisions concerned as appropriate. ADB\u2019s water sector network will \nbe the main internal target group and consultation forum for the TA\u2019s activities. A steering \ncommittee comprising directors of the concerned divisions in ADB\u2019s regional departments and \nRSDD will provide overall guidance and supervision to the TA activities, and will approve the \ndetailed design and implementation arrangements of major components of the TA prior to their \ncommencement.4  \n \n16.  A  TA  office  will  be  established  in  RSAN.  Approximately  75  person-months  of \ninternational  and  130  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  needed  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  activities  of  the  TA  by  either  RSAN  or  the  regional  departments \n                                                 \n3  The governments of the DMCs that will participate in the TA are expected to provide in-kind contributions to \nfacilitate implementation of TA activities taking place in them, such as consultation and training workshops and pilot \ndemonstration activities.  \n4  The steering committee may invite representatives of other ADB departments/divisions, e.g., the office of external \nrelations, private sector department, evaluation divisions, and economics and research divisions, to participate in \nits meetings as appropriate. Major components are defined as having a cost estimate of more than $400,000, and \nthese components are indicated in the outline terms of reference in Appendix 3. ", "  5\n \nconcerned. The required areas of expertise include water policy, institutional development, \nwater law, training needs assessment, knowledge management, information systems, water \nresources  assessment,  coastal  zone  management,  water  supply  and  utility  management, \nnatural resources economics, multimedia production, public awareness, urban social research, \nand community water education. Two full-time administrator-research assistants, financed by \nthe  TA,  will  support  the  TA  team  and  steering  committee  in  overall  coordination  and \nimplementation of the TA. Further short-term international and domestic consultants may be \nrecruited if required to fill gaps in the TA team\u2019s expertise. Most of the required consultants will \nbe recruited as individuals.5 ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of \nconsultants. Outline terms of reference are shown in Appendix 3. Equipment and materials to be \nfinanced by the TA will be procured by the consultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB.6  \n \n17.  ADB staff in headquarters and resident missions will be encouraged to participate in the \nregional and national workshops and other activities to strengthen ADB\u2019s capacity to implement \nits water policy at the country level. The TA consultants will, on a selective basis, be involved in \nsupporting  ADB\u2019s  project  team  missions  to  ensure  the  incorporation  of  new  water  policy \napproaches and practices in water sector operations. Each participating DMC will designate the \nwater sector apex body, or agency assigned to coordinate water sector activities, as the national \ncounterpart agency; this agency will coordinate the country\u2019s participation in the TA activities, \ndrawing on the interest and expertise of relevant water stakeholders in the country, including \nthose  from  central  and  provincial  agencies,  river  basins,  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  the \nacademe, research and professional organizations, and other interested parties. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 15 months, commencing in April 2002, and \nending in June 2003. Several workshops will be held during TA implementation. An inception \nreport will be prepared by the TA team after two months of implementation, with assistance from \nthe consultants. An interim report and a final report will be prepared in December 2002 and \nJune 2003, respectively. All reports will be published in ADB website.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $4,000,000 to be financed by the \nCooperation Fund for the Water Sector on a grant basis for the purpose of Promoting Effective \nWater Management Policies and Practices. \n                                                 \n5  The required expertise is highly diverse and is simultaneously needed in several regional departments. \n6  Equipment may include computers, software, multimedia instruments, and equipment for demonstration projects.

These outline terms of reference for consultants describes the main tasks in each of the \nsix categories of the program of activities to promote effective water management policies and \npractices in the region and thereby catalyze the implementation of the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) water policy in the Asia and Pacific region. The six categories are promotion and \npublic  awareness;  knowledge  base  and  capacity  building;  pilot  demonstration;  water \npartnerships;  regional  events  and  initiatives;  and  program  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. Poverty reduction is a crosscutting priority in all tasks. The water sector committee \nestablished under ADB\u2019s revised business processes will coordinate the program of activities. \n \nA.  Promotion and Public Awareness  \n2.  An international public relations specialist will be engaged on an individual basis to \ndevelop and manage ADB\u2019s water awareness program (WAP). The WAP will (i) promote public \nunderstanding of water issues and disseminate ADB\u2019s water policy, (ii) facilitate dialogue among \nwater stakeholders on the water reform agenda in the region, (iii) help to educate children and \nyouth on water issues and their role in finding solutions, and (iv) support small pilot projects for \ncommunity water education.  The WAP will use a range of suitable tools and activities to \ncommunicate a range of messages effectively to different target audiences, including (i) the \ngeneral public, especially in the Asia and Pacific region; (ii) water sector stakeholders and \ndecision makers; (iii) children and youth; and (iv) poor communities. The WAP will also help to \nstrengthen  ADB\u2019s  collaboration  with  the  media  in  reaching  these  target  audiences.  The \ndevelopment messages will initially be derived from ADB\u2019s water policy, from the themes being \nprepared  for  the  third  World  Water  Forum  (WWF),  and  from  other  key  water  themes  in \ncoordination with development partners. The tools and activities include ADB\u2019s water website, a \nregional quarterly water newsletter, publicity materials and photographs, video productions, \npublic service announcements, media relations, water goodwill ambassadors, exhibitions, and \npilot community education projects. The detailed design and implementation arrangements of \nthe WAP will be approved by the TA steering committee prior to the start of implementation. \n \n3.  To help implement the WAP, international specialists with expertise in public and media \nrelations,  multimedia  production,  and  information,  education,  and  communication,  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis.

A team of international and domestic water sector specialists will be engaged to carry \nout a pilot study on sustainable water management in atoll countries and to strengthen an \nexisting partnership of atoll island DMCs in the Pacific subregion, chaired by the President of \nKiribati. The atolls are at risk of severe impact by climate change and the resulting rise in sea \nlevel. A pilot study will be carried out in Kiribati, a country that is representative of similar atolls \nthroughout the Pacific subregion. Kiribati is a remote string of coral atolls that is critically \ndependent on floating freshwater lenses and rainwater for its water supplies. These lenses are \nvulnerable to pollution by sewage and pesticides. Rising sea levels due to global warming \nthreaten the water lenses with saltwater intrusion, as well as reducing the land area and thus \nincreasing population densities. The consultants will carry out a pilot study on national water \nresources assessment and coastal zone planning in Kiribati to reduce vulnerability to climate \nchange  and  promote  sustainable  water  management  in  atoll  countries.  Potential  solutions \ninclude accessing water from other (unpopulated) atolls, reclaiming land in lagoon areas, or \nredistributing population to outer islands. The TA will examine these and other options in the \ncontext of an overall water resources assessment in Kiribati and similar atoll countries in the \nPacific subregion. The team of consultants will work in the Pacific Department. Cofinancing by \ndevelopment partners will be pursued to replicate the study in other Pacific DMCs. The detailed \ndesign and implementation arrangements of the pilot study will be approved by the TA steering \ncommittee prior to implementation. ", "12      Appendix 3         \nE.
