INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2012, during the country program consultation, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Innovations in Credit Risk Management and Financial Service \nCapabilities for Rural Commercial Banks in Tianjin Municipality.1 Following a reconnaissance \nmission in March 2013 and a fact-finding mission in September 2013, ADB and the government \nreached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangement, costs, and \nterms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The reform of rural credit cooperatives to rural commercial banks (RCBs) started in mid-\n2003 with the establishment of the first RCB, Wujiang Rural Commercial Bank Co. Ltd. in \nJiangsu Province. After rapid expansion, 85 RCBs were operating in the PRC as of end-2010, \nwith assets totaling CNY 2.77 trillion representing 6.9% of gross domestic product. \n \n3.  RCBs have changed their focus from being driven by policy to a commercial, market-\nbased business. Yet financial sector development in rural areas in the PRC continues to lag \nbehind that of urban areas. Rural financial institutions have limited financial services for the rural \npopulation, and RCBs have often adopted conservative approaches to lending. This is due in \npart to their new commercial focus, the fact that often a majority of RCBs\u2019 capital is owned by \ncorporations,  and  the RCBs\u2019  negative  historical  experience  with  high  nonperforming  loans. \nAdditionally, RCBs have shifted their strategic focus away from their roots in rural areas to \nperceived greater opportunities in urban areas, where they believe they have greater lending \ncapability as their poor historical loan loss experience has led them to believe that rural lending \nis riskier. Requirements to provide collateral as credit risk mitigation have also impaired rural \nfinancial access, as often this sector lacks assets for pledging.   \n \n4.  Lending  in  rural  areas  therefore  remains  inadequate  to  effectively  support  financial \ninclusion that can help create rising incomes and achieve wealth equality with urban areas. \nRCBs\u2019 strategic shift toward becoming urban-based businesses hampers the expansion and \ninstitutionalization of rural finance knowledge. Across much of the PRC, rural areas are poorer \nthan most urban areas. The socioeconomic landscape in rural areas in Tianjin is changing \nrapidly with the combination of emigration of rural residents and farmers to urban areas and the \nmove to create larger industrial farms and farming cooperative ventures. However, the rural \npopulation of Tianjin involved in agriculture remains at approximately 40% of Tianjin\u2019s total \npopulation. Additionally, farmers and rural residents are not just seen as being agricultural \nproducers, but they are also increasingly seen as investors in manufacturing and processing \nbusinesses,  as  providers  of  services,  and  as  developing  broader  consumer  spending  and \ninvestment habits. The shift has contributed to the per capita gross domestic product of Tianjin \nbeing the highest in the PRC at $13,392.3 These changes draw attention to the fact that \nfinancial services in rural areas need to become more sophisticated and offer a greater product \nrange. These changes also require that RCBs create sound overall rural finance strategies to \nguide their business activities. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 October 2013. \n3  Source: National Bureau of Statistics online database December 2011. \n ", "2   \n5.  Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank (TRCB) was formed from the merger of Tianjin Rural \nCooperative  Bank  and  nine  rural  county  and  district  credit  cooperatives  in  2010,  with  a \nregistered capital of CNY 7.0 billion. TRCB had a net capital of CNY 11.7 billion at the end of \n2012. It has 5,400 shareholders, of whom 4,598 farmers and staff that owned shares in the \noriginal 10 institutions took new shares in TRCB. However, farmers and staff own only 23.2% of \nthe total shares in aggregate, with the remaining shares owned by large corporations. At end-\n2010, TRCB had a capital adequacy ratio of 11.2% and a nonperforming loan ratio of 2.09%. \n \n6.  The  Tianjin  Finance  Bureau  (TFB)  provided  additional  capital  to  TRCB  during  its \nestablishment and agreed to cover any future write-offs from the assets transferred from the \nnine rural credit cooperatives during the merger. The TFB serves as the administrator for RCBs \nin Tianjin in cooperation with the local branch of the China Banking Regulatory Commission \n(CBRC). TRCB is responsible for managing new nonperforming loans that have surfaced after \nits establishment. \n \n7.  However,  weak  credit  risk  appraisal  systems,  undeveloped  rural  finance  risk \nmanagement and control practices, and a lack of innovative rural finance products are major \nchallenges to TRCB and other rural-based financial institutions across the PRC. Necessary \ncredit  risk  management  improvements  will  include  well-designed  borrower  screening  and \nunderwriting processes, proper loan structuring and pricing capabilities, centralized monitoring \nmechanisms, effective collection procedures, and capability for active oversight of operations.  \n \n8.  These credit risk management enhancements will require proper data management and \nsupport systems. TRCB and other RCBs across the PRC lack rigorous information technology \n(IT) systems and environments to support proper risk management, product distribution, and \nclient and customer needs\u2019 intelligence. Gaps in IT and the operational oversight environment \nare  of  special  concern  to  remote  rural  branches.  Enhancement  of  operational  oversight \nprocesses and the IT system support environment are needed to allow for expanded credit risk \nmanagement processes. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n9.  The impact will be improved growth prospects for rural areas providing for expanded \ndevelopment opportunities. The outcome will be increased access by rural residents and rural \nsmall businesses in Tianjin to finance through expanded offerings of financial products and \nservices. Performance will be measured by presentation to the TFB of a benchmark rural credit \nrisk appraisal and management system and a rural financial product strategy by TRCB, and by \nsharing the system with other finance bureaus and RCBs in the PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n10.  ADB has employed the theme of financial inclusion to support rural sector development \nand microfinance. Recent projects include Rural Finance Development and Supervision, Rural \nFinance Innovation and Rural and Agriculture Financial Statistical System Development, and \nCapacity Development of Partner Banks in Microfinance Wholesale Lending.4   \n                                                \n4   ADB.  2008.

This  TA  will  assess  TRCB\u2019s  rural  credit  processes,  risk  management  and  control \nprocesses, rural business strategy, and financial product offerings, in line with international best \npractices.  Subsequently,  an  enhanced  system  for  TRCB  will  be  prepared  to  promote  a \ncommercially sustainable rural finance business process that specifically incorporates the risks \nand product needs of rural households and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) clients.  \nAn enhanced system will support an effective credit appraisal and risk management system for \nselect clients; properly price, underwrite, and structure loans; and manage the resulting credit \nrisks. Only lending that is generated from a sound  system and under a strong credit risk \nmanagement process can be conducive to the formation of a long-term dynamic relationship \nbetween risk and return and the needs of the rural communities. \n \n12.  The TA will support an assessment of IT system needs and preparation of a project plan \nrelated  to  the  data  needs  for  rural  credit  risk  and  risk  management,  including  product \ndevelopment that will also fully integrate remote rural branches. The TA will also help TRCB \nestablish an overall rural finance business strategy to promote rural lending and expand product \nofferings.  An  institutionalization  mechanism  will  be  in  place  to  accumulate  rural  finance \nknowledge,  support  ongoing  staff  training  programs  in  TRCB,  and  ultimately  disseminate \nlessons learned to other RCBs in Tianjin and across the PRC. \n \n13.  The overall result will be expressed in a knowledge product for the enhancement of rural \ncredit risk management, operational oversight, risk controls, and development of rural business \nstrategy and products. The knowledge product and results will be shared with other RCBs in \nTianjin via the closing workshop in cooperation with the TFB and the local branch of the CBRC. \nThe knowledge product will also be shared with other municipal finance bureaus and RCBs \nthrough publication with the support of the TFB and CBRC. \n \n14.  The TA is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which identifies finance as one of \nADB\u2019s  core  areas  of  operations.5 The  TA  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2011\u20132015, for the PRC, which emphasizes inclusive growth, particularly through \nimproved access to microfinance and SME finance.6 Rebalancing urban and rural growth is \nanother key focus of the ADB\u2013PRC partnership, and will be facilitated by the improvement in \nrural finance and access to credit services, particularly by the rural poor. \n \n15.  The  first  output  will  be  an  assessment  of  TRCB\u2019s  rural  credit  processes  against \ninternational  best  practices  and  preparation  of  a  new  system  and  an  alternative  strategy \nregarding rural credits and financial products. \n \n16.  The TA will begin with an assessment of current global best practices for rural credit risk \nappraisal  and  risk  management  systems  to  compile  relevant  and  useful  lessons  for  rural \nmicrofinance and SME credits and financial products. This will involve research on the existing \nrisk appraisal, underwriting, risk management, and control processes prevailing in advanced \nrural  financial  institutions  globally,  including  a  study  tour  to  relevant  rural  banks  in  ADB \nmembers to review practices first-hand. \n \n17.  Activities under this output will include: (i) identifying and analyzing the key elements that \nhave hampered the expansion of credit and financial products in rural areas; (ii) assessing \noverall rural finance business strategy and compiling relevant financial product offerings; (iii) \nanalyzing business processes related to rural financial product operations through interviews \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nand field visits; and (iv) preparing detailed descriptions of sound rural credit procedures, risk \nappraisal, and management practices. \n \n18.  The study tour will cover sophisticated rural-based banks in ADB members that have \nrural populations with broad and advanced financial needs. The study tour will include a visit to \na developed member country within Asia and also to Canada or the United States. The scope of \nthe study tour will not only cover advanced risk management practices, but will also assess \nstrategic  development  plans  and  the  range  of  financial  products  offered.  The  activity  and \ndevelopment of the community bank markets in Canada and the United States are among the \nmost advanced globally. These community bank markets are vital in serving the rural sectors in \nthese  countries  and  have  developed  more  refined  modes  of  operation  against  larger \ncompetitors. A visit to one of these markets is a key to expanding knowledge needed for the \ngrowing sophistication of the population of rural areas of the PRC.   \n \n19.  Detailed reports and specific process work plans will be produced that are needed to \nestablish a sound rural credit risk appraisal and rural finance risk management system, and new \ndetailed process maps, procedures, product descriptions, and their marketing strategies will \nalso be prepared. The new processes, risk management system, and strategy will be presented \nto the board of TRCB for approval and submitted to the TFB for confirmation. \n \n20.  The second output will be the design and development of a data management and IT \nsystem plan and rollout schedule to support rural residents and SME credits and rural financial \nproducts.  This output will use TRCB as a benchmark and will involve a detailed assessment of \nTRCB\u2019s  existing  database  systems  and  IT  arrangements  that  can  support  rural  areas  to \ndetermine the changes needed and the estimated costs for implementing proposed changes. \nPlans proposed will ensure easy access and processing since the expanded system must also \nbe used in remote rural branches.    \n \n21.  The final output will be the institutionalization and dissemination of an effective rural \ncredit risk appraisal, financial product strategy, and risk management system within TRCB and \nto RCBs in Tianjin. This output will lead to improved capacity for risk management of rural \nfinance across RCBs in Tianjin and other provinces and municipalities in the PRC through \ndissemination of a knowledge product.  \n \n22.  Activities under this output will include designing training materials on rural financial \nproducts, rural credit risk appraisal, and client risk profiling. These materials will be used by \nTRCB  as  part  of  their  ongoing  staff  training  and  also  at  workshops  financed  by  the  TA. \nWorkshops will be planned so that the results of the TA will be shared among other RCBs in \nTianjin  and  with  other  key  stakeholders  in  rural  finance  in  the  PRC.  The  project  team \nconsultants, along with TRCB, the TFB, and the local branch of the CBRC, will identify and \nconfirm  participation  of  key  stakeholders  in  rural  microfinance  for  inclusion  in  the  training \nsessions and the final workshop. A knowledge product on best practices will be prepared \nconcerning rural microfinance sector issues and concerns that have hampered expansion of \nrural area credit and products. It will also incorporate an outline for rural credit risk management \nand financial strategy improvement. The knowledge product will be disseminated across other \nmunicipal finance bureaus and made available to all RCBs in the PRC.   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n23.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and management time, office space, \nfull access to all materials, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n24.  The TFB will be the executing agency, and the TRCB will be the implementing agency. \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented from 15 November 2013 to 31 March 2015. The TA will \nengage one international consultant for a total of 5 person-months and two national consultants \nfor a total of 9 person-months. A software firm with a 5 person-month equivalent will be recruited \nunder  consultant  qualification  selection  (lump  sum)  to  assess  and  provide  software  and \nhardware evaluation and upgrade plan for the rural sector to enable completion of the data \nrequirements for the risk management system and improved overall data management. \n \n26.  ADB will engage the international and national consultants, as well as any resource \nperson, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants is in Appendix 3. An advance payment facility will be used for training, seminar, \nand conference administration by the executing agency. \n \n27.  The implementing agency will supervise the day-to-day work of the consultants and take \noverall responsibility for training programs, seminars, workshops, and international study tours.  \nThe  TA  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  based  on  the  implementation  of  activities  and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget.  \n \n28.  To support monitoring and evaluation, consultants will be required to provide (i) an \ninception report within 2 weeks of commencement of work defining a detailed work plan and \nmilestones consistent with the DMF; (ii) deliverables consistent with the DMF activities, outputs, \nand delivery dates; and (iii) other papers and submissions required by the TRCB for submission \nto the TFB and CBRC. The main mechanism to monitor and assess the TA will be review \nmissions.  \n \n29.  The TA is based on the assumptions of (i) good coordination between ADB, the TFB, \nCBRC,  and  TRCB;  (ii)  the  TFB  and  CBRC\u2019s  support  and  commitment;  (iii)  the  TRCB\u2019s \ncontinuing commitment to expand their rural credit operations; and (iv) the TRCB\u2019s commitment \nto share the result of the TA with other RCBs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n30.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Innovations in Credit Risk Management \nand Financial Service Capabilities for Rural Commercial Banks in Tianjin Municipality, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved growth  Establishment of a  TRCB reports to TFB   TRCB\u2019s continuous \nprospects for rural  benchmark rural credit    commitment to expand \nareas providing for  risk appraisal and  Publication and  its rural credit operations \nexpanded  management system  distribution of a   \ndevelopment  and rural financial  knowledge product  Risk \nopportunities.   products strategy (by    Adverse policy changes \n2018)  Summary reports from  of CBRC to limit credit \n  training and final  expansion in rural areas \nResults are shared with  workshops \nother RCBs (by 2018) \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased access by  TRCB\u2019s lending to rural  People\u2019s Bank of China,  Results of the project will \nrural residents and  SMEs and residents  Tianjin Branch; CBRC;  be shared among other \nrural small businesses  increases by 10% (by  TFB; TRCB  RCBs and adopted \nin Tianjin to finance  2016)     \nthrough expanded  TRCB reports to  Risk \nofferings of financial  People\u2019s Bank of China,  Adverse change in the \nproducts and services.
