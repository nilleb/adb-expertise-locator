At the request of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Fact-Finding Mission visited Sri \nLanka on 5\u20139 May 2003, to formulate the technical assistance (TA) for preparing a public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) expressway project.1 The TA is included in the 2003\u20132005 country \nstrategy and program update.2 The Asian Development Bank held discussions with responsible \nofficials  of  the  concerned  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and \nImplementation;  Ministry  of  Enterprise  Development,  Industrial  Policy,  and  Investment \nPromotion  (MOED  IP&IP);  Ministry  of  Finance;  Ministry  of  Highways  (MOH),  Board  of \nInvestment (BOI); and Bureau of Infrastructure Investment (BII). Subsequent to the Fact-Finding \nMission, the Government decided3 to single source from its own funds consulting services from \nPricewaterhouseCoopers (Pvt) Ltd, India in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers Private \nLimited, Sri Lanka (PWC), and Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation International PTY \nLimited (SMEC), to assist in the development of the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway (CKE) \non a PPP basis. This Government decision made it necessary to adjust the scope of the TA. \nThis paper reflects the adjustments and ensures the continued relevance of the TA in the \ncontext of the ongoing reform process in Sri Lanka. On 12 August 2003, the Government and \nADB reached an understanding on the goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, financing, and terms of reference for consultants.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Roads account for about 92% of freight and passenger traffic in Sri Lanka and play a \ncritical role in the country\u2019s development. The road network spans 83,880 kilometers (km). The \nnetwork is divided into three categories: (i) the primary system of about 11,650 km of national \nhighways (classes A and B) serving interprovincial and long-distance traffic; (ii) the secondary \nsystem, consisting of 13,880 km of provincial roads (classes C, D, and E) serving intraprovincial \ntraffic; and (iii) the tertiary systems, comprising 58,350 km of local roads. Despite the extensive \nroad network, its quality and capacity is not sufficient to meet the present and expected future \ndemand for passenger and freight transport services. Most roads were built more than 50 years \nago and current traffic levels exceed the design capacity of many roads. This has resulted in \nhigh traffic accident rates and overall traffic congestion. Road maintenance, rehabilitation, and \nnew construction have not kept pace with the rapid growth in demand for transport. \n \n3.  Since 1980, ADB has provided nine loans for the road sector, totaling $400 million, and \n18 TAs, totaling $8.55 million. Among multilateral funding agencies, ADB is currently the largest \nmultilateral agency to the road sector in Sri Lanka and is coordinating its support with other \nexternal agencies. The principal bilateral sources of external assistance have been the Republic \nof Korea, Kuwait, Japan, and Sweden. \n \n4.  Following the analysis and recommendations of an ADB-financed TA,4 which identified a \nnumber of major obstacles to improving sector performance (lack of capacity, competition and \nrelevant business processes, resulting in inefficiency and inadequate maintenance), ADB and \nthe Government decided to focus on improving overall sector performance through institutional \nand sector reforms. Consequently, the medium-term strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s assistance to Sri \nLanka' transport sector focuses on (i) policy and institutional reforms of road sector institutions; \n(ii) identification and promotion of sustainable financing mechanisms, including formation of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, (Internet edition) on 19 May 2003. \n2  ADB. 2002.

Improved  sector \nperformance will facilitate economic growth, raise income, and create employment, thereby \nreducing poverty. Strategic investments are needed to link less developed regions to markets \nand service centers.  \n \n5.  The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to these reform measures. In the context of \nits  economic  reform  program,  \u201cRegaining  Sri  Lanka,\u201d5  issued  in  December  2002,  the \nGovernment emphasized the development of Sri Lanka\u2019s infrastructure. Key objectives of the \nGovernment's proposed economic reform program are to create economic growth and ensure \nan efficient transport sector capable of reducing financial contributions from the public sector \nand attracting private investment. In particular, building a National Highway system and an \nintegrated road network are preconditions for achieving the economic growth targets and are \ntherefore priority reform initiatives. ADB is assisting in developing a strategic approach to \nplanning  the  road  network  through  a  TA  for  preparing  a  road  sector  master  plan,  for \nimplementation  in  2004.  Funding  for  the  planned  network  development,  operation,  and \nmaintenance costs must be ensured. Considering the limited financing available for this purpose \nfrom public funds and the size of the investment needs, most of the financing will have to be \nsourced privately from domestic and foreign investors.  \n \n6.  \u201cRegaining  Sri  Lanka\u201d  envisages  a  plan  to  develop  four  expressways:  (i)  CKE, \napproximately  25  km;  (ii)  Colombo-Kandy  Highway,  approximately  100  km;  (iii)  the  Outer \nCircular Highway to the City of Colombo, approximately 50 km; and (iv) the Southern Transport \nDevelopment Project, Colombo-Matara Highway, approximately 128 km and 15 km of access \nlinks. The total cost of these expressways is estimated to $800 million. The Government has \nspent  approximately  $35  million  on  construction  work  relating  to  the  CKE,  but  project \nadvancement is currently constrained by limited funding. The total cost of the CKE is estimated \nat $120 million. With the Government's decision to appoint PWC and SMEC consultants to \nassist in the development of the CKE on a PPP basis, clear governmental priority has been \ngiven to the development of this expressway. The Swedish International Development Agency \n(Sida) has provided assistance for the preparation of a feasibility study for the Colombo-Kandy \nHighway. The study was completed in December 2001. Financing of the Outer Circular Highway \nis being discussed for financing by the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC), which, \nwith ADB, is funding the ongoing construction of the Colombo-Matara Highway. \n \n7.  The Government of Sri Lanka has requested ADB to provide TA for (i) developing a \nstrategy to determine the potential role of the private sector in the financing, construction, \noperation and maintenance of expressways through the formation of PPPs; and (ii) assisting \nwith the preparation of a model PPP project for the CKE. The establishment of PPPs would \nreduce the financial burden of financing these expressways, and bring private sector managerial \nexperience into the financing, construction and operation. Thus, PPPs could shorten project \nimplementation  and  encourage  greater  efficiency  in  the  construction  and  operation  of \nexpressways. ADB supports the Government's efforts in developing this strategy and highlights \nthe need for ensuring that adequate policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for PPPs \nare developed and established.  \n \n8.  Currently, Sri Lanka does not have an institutional framework that clearly identifies one \nsingle autonomous agency responsible for financing, developing, maintaining and managing \nPPPs in expressways. The Task Force on Land Transportation under the Economy and Policy \nCommittee reporting to the Prime Minister is responsible for formulating policies and programs \nrelated to national transport. The Ministry of Transport, Highways, and Civil Aviation has the \noverall responsibility for implementing these policies and programs. However, responsibility for \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Policy Development and Implementation. 2002. Regaining Sri Lanka. \n  Available at: http:/www.erd.gov.lk. ", "  3\ndevelopment of programs and projects for National Highways rests with MOH. The Road \nDevelopment  Authority  (RDA),  a  statutory  institution  assigned  to  MOH,  is  responsible  for \nplanning, managing, and maintaining the National Highways. BOI functions under MOEDIP&IP. \nIt is the main institution responsible for promoting foreign direct investment and has the authority \nto grant incentives to investors by exempting them from the customs, inland revenue, exchange \ncontrol, and import control laws. BII, established within BOI, coordinates and facilitates private \nsector investment in infrastructure projects and is involved in project preparation activities \nrelating to expressways in Sri Lanka. \n \n9.  The ADB-financed Road Sector Development Project,6 takes the initial steps in involving \nthe domestic private sector in maintaining the road network and commits RDA to increasing the \nproportion of domestic financing under consolidated funds for civil works and engineering for \nroad construction and maintenance works contracted out to the domestic private sector. The \nnew TA constitutes a natural continuum along the path to increased private sector participation \nin other segments of the road sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The development of expressways will support economic growth by improving transport \nefficiency and reducing travel time and transport cost, which will directly benefit the domestic \nprivate sector and create job opportunities. Private sector participation in the financing of the \nexpressways will help free public resources, which can be redirected to social spending. The \npurpose of the TA is to assist in (i) developing a strategy to determine the potential role of the \nprivate sector in the financing, constructing, operating and maintaining expressways through the \nformation of PPPs; and (ii) providing assistance to prepare a model PPP project for the CKE. \nConsequently,  the  TA  has  been  designed  to  assist  through  two  components:  a  sector \ndevelopment component, which is the primary focus of the TA; and an investment component, \nto ensure compliance with ADB requirements for possible financial assistance to the CKE model \nproject. The interaction between the relevant government agencies, the TA consultants, and the \nPWC and SMEC consultants will secure knowledge transfer and capacity building throughout \nthe TA implementation period. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Sector Development Component.  During the sector component, the individual policy \nand  reform  implementation  adviser  and  the  internationally  recognized  consulting  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultants  will  assist  to  prepare  a  strategy  developing  the \nexpressways through the creation of PPPs. The consultants will (i) identify, review, and analyze \nthe existing policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for private sector involvement in the \nfinancing, constructing, operating and maintaining expressways; (ii) evaluate the constraints to \nthe existing frameworks' abilities to (a) enhance public sector financing capacity, and (b) attract \nprivate  sector  participation  according  to  policy  objectives;  (iii)  suggest  a  methodology  for \nfinancial structuring of PPPs covering debt-equity ratios and prospects for raising debt/equity \nfrom the foreign and local markets, considering (a) the availability of funds, inflation, debt \nservicing and foreign exchange risk; and (b) possible enhancement such as government annuity \nand revenue sharing schemes, government incentives and guarantees, toll structures, and any \nother features, including suggestions for investment schemes such as equity financing, parallel \nloan financing, partial credit guarantees, and political risk guarantees for consideration by ADB \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.

The \nconsultants will also develop a concession agreement that will serve as a model for subsequent \nPPP initiatives in the road sector and will incorporate the findings from the PWC\u2019s consultant\u2019s \ndevelopment of the CKE concession agreement.  \n \n12.  Investment Component.  During the project preparation part of the TA, the consultants \nwill review the preparatory work being undertaken by the PWC and SMEC consultants for the \nCKE to ensure that the proposed project is being prepared to standards that meet ADB\u2019s \ncompliance requirements. Environmental assessment will be conducted in accordance with \nADB's and the Government's guidelines and procedures. Poverty and social analyses will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001). A \nsummary initial poverty and social analysis is provided in Appendix 1. In close coordination with \nADB's project team leader, the consultants will explore options for ADB assistance for meeting \nfinancing requirements for a sustainable CKE PPP project. Consistent with the PPP structure of \nthe project, the consultants will identify specific subprojects for ADB financing through its public \nand private sector windows (with the latter to be reviewed by the Private Sector Operations \nDepartment). To appropriately leverage any proposed direct assistance from ADB, the financing \nplan  for  each  subproject  should  incorporate  cofinancing  components,  from  official  and \ncommercial sources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.0 million equivalent, comprising $736,000 in \nforeign exchange and $264,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $800,000 \ncomprising $736,000 in foreign exchange costs and $64,000 equivalent of local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The cost estimates \nare presented in Appendix 2. The Government will finance the remaining $200,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency costs covering counterpart staff and related salaries, provision of office \naccommodation, and related services and facilities. The Government has been informed that \nthe approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Considering  the  institutional  framework  in  Sri  Lanka  (para.  8),  the  implementation \narrangements are as follows: MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A project steering \ncommittee (PSC), subject to ADB\u2019s approval, will be established for the TA. The PSC will \nprovide overall policy guidance to the consultants and ensure the quality of the study. In \nparticular, the PSC will oversee the development of the model concession agreement and set \nup a technical subcommittee for this purpose, with representatives from relevant stakeholders, \nincluding lenders. The PSC will be co chaired by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, \nHighways and Civil Aviation and Ministry of Policy Development and Implementation, MOH, \nMOED IP&IP, BOI, the Chairperson of the Task Force on Land Transportation under the \nEconomy and Policy Committee, the Ministry of Land and Development, and the Central \nEnvironmental Authority will be members of the PSC. The PSC will meet as often as necessary, \nbut at least once a month. The PSC will appoint a project director to oversee the implementation \nof the TA, which will occur through two implementing agencies: RDA and BII. The project \ndirector, who will be a senior level staff member, will be responsible for ensuring effective \ncoordination between the consultants, MOF and the RDA and BII. The RDA and BII will be \nresponsible for the day-to-day implementation of the TA, and will each assign four of their \npermanent staff to work with the consultants. The first component of the TA will result on \nrecommendations on how to establish a formal institutional framework for the formation of PPPs \nin the road sector in Sri Lanka. The Government has assured ADB that all required counterpart ", "  5\nstaff, office space, supplies, and support facilities will be made available to the consultants in a \ntimely manner.  \n \n15.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2004, with completion by January 2005. \nThe TA will be carried out over 12 months by: (i) an individual policy and reform implementation \nadviser, advising the government on implementing policy and reforms and ensuring coordination \namong ADB, the Government, the internationally recognized consulting firm hired under the TA, \nthe PWC and SMEC consultants, and the government agencies; and (ii)  an internationally \nrecognized consulting firm in association with domestic consultants. The total input will be about \n12 person-months by the individual consultant, 20 by the international consultants and 10,5 by \nthe domestic consultants. The consultants will have demonstrated experience from comparable \ncountry contexts in the region in (i) advising on policy and reform implementation regarding \nPPPs in expressways; (ii) law; (iii) project finance, including financial structuring and financing \noptions  related  to  infrastructure  projects  through  government  and  donor  funded  viability \nenhancement strategies; (iv) capital markets; (v) resettlement; (vi) engineering; (vii) economics; \n(viii) environmental planning; and (ix) social analysis. The international PPP specialist will be the \nteam leader for the internally recognized consulting firm. The TA consultants will be recruited by \nADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and (other arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants). ADB will use full technical \nproposals and quality- and cost-based selection methods for consultant selection. Outline terms \nof reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The policy and reform implementation adviser and the internal consulting firm will jointly \nprepare  (i)  an  inception  report,  within  4  weeks  after commencement  of  services;  and  (ii) \nprogress reports, to be submitted monthly. The consultants will organize a study tour, preferably \nto the National Highway Authority of India for the project director and four representatives from \nthe RDA and BII, and will help organize a donor coordination meeting headed by ADB to \ndiscuss how funding agencies can best assist in achieving the PPP goals and securing the \nnecessary public and private financing. An interim report will be submitted 6 months after TA \ninception, and a draft final report 11 months after commencement of services. The final report is \nto be submitted within 1 week after the consultants have received comments on the draft final \nreport from MOF and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for preparing the Public-Private Partnership Expressway Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \nA.
