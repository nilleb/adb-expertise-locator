I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Comprehensive  Socioeconomic  Urban \nDevelopment Project in Viet Tri, Hung Yen, and Dong Dang.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  construct  and  upgrade  urban  infrastructure  and  strengthen  local \ngovernments\u2019 urban management capacities in the project cities of Viet Tri, Hung Yen, and \nDong Dang. It is expected that these cities will become economic centers in northern Viet Nam \nto complement Ha Noi.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Regional  economic  corridor.  The  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  (NSEC),  which \nconnects Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries and the southeastern People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  (PRC),  is  a  dynamic  area  of  development.  The  eastern  branch  of  the  NSEC, \nconnecting  Kunming  (Yunnan  Province,  PRC) and  Nanning  (Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous \nRegion, PRC) to Ha Noi and northern Viet Nam, is experiencing rapid growth arising from \nforeign direct investments, cross-border trade, and flows of goods and people. Increased traffic \nand trade along the NSEC has resulted in tremendous development pressures on urban areas \nalong the corridor. The transformation of the NSEC into a full-fledged economic corridor requires \nthat these urban areas can function as nodes of economic activity and growth centers, linking their \nhinterlands and the outlying region. Local economic development in corridor cities will benefit the \nNSEC and vice versa. However, the sprawl of settlements along the NSEC is largely uncontrolled, \nleading to additional infrastructure costs and degraded environmental conditions.  \n \n4.  Secondary  cities.  The metropolitan areas that receive large inflows of migrants are \nbecoming more congested, and are experiencing increasingly serious social and environmental \nproblems. At the same time, secondary cities are stagnating. If the neglect of secondary city \ndevelopment continues, the resulting spatial and economic disparities will further constrain not \nonly urban development, but also social stability and Viet Nam\u2019s overall economic development. In \nline with the government decentralization policy, targeted infrastructure investments in secondary \ncities will help attract or retain residents, possibly reducing migration to the large metropolitan \ncities. The diversion away from these metropolitan areas and the potential inducement to foster \ngrowth in secondary cities would result in more balanced regional development. \n \n5.  Urban issues. The main challenges facing corridor cities as well as secondary cities arise \nfrom lack of urban infrastructure investments and the limited ability of local governments to \nprovide reliable and affordable urban services. Absence of links between the local socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan, spatial plan, and master plans for urban subsectors is the major challenge \nfacing  urban  development  and  management.  Inability  to  recover  cost  for  municipal  service \nprovision causes poor operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure. This results in missing \nlinks in the road network, obsolete water supply systems and high water losses, floods and \nclogged  drains,  as  well  as  uncontrolled  disposal  of  untreated  wastes  that  contaminate  the \nproductive capacity of cities, making them less competitive and livable. Lack of infrastructure and \nlimited capacity to manage urban services discourage external investments that are critical to \nsocioeconomic development and growth. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. \n ", "2 \n6.  Project cities. Three urban areas were selected as the project cities: Viet Tri in Phu Tho \nProvince, Hung Yen in Hung Yen Province, and Dong Dang in Lang Son Province. They are \nlocated along the NSEC outside Ha Noi, and classified secondary cities in northern Viet Nam. \n \n7.  Viet Tri. With good potential to become a logistics hub in northern Viet Nam, Viet Tri is the \ncapital of Phu Tho Province and located about 84 kilometers (km) northwest of Ha Noi, just \noutside the administrative border of Greater  Ha Noi.3 Viet Tri has sound access to various \ntransport modes. Three rivers (Red River, Da River, and Lo River) meet at Viet Tri where they \nmerge  into  Red  River,  which  flows  into  Ha  Noi.  The  city  is  located  along  the  railway  and \nexpressway connecting the Noi Bai international airport and Lao Cai, a border city with the PRC. \nThe distance between Viet Tri and the Noi Bai international airport is about 50 km. Strategic \nplanning and investments in public infrastructure development are necessary for Viet Tri to grow \nas a regional logistics hub for efficient distribution of goods. \n \n8.  Hung Yen. Located between Ha Noi and Hai Phong (62 km to Ha Noi and 108 km to Hai \nPhong), Hung Yen is the capital of Hung Yen Province. Within Hung Yen City is an old town with a \nnumber  of  historical  relics.  In  the  15th\u201316th  century,  the  city  was  an  important  center  for \ncommerce and trade through its river port. The government has started preserving a number of \nold  buildings  that  have  historical  value.  Further  improvements  in  access  and  environmental \ninfrastructure  in  the  old  town  are  expected  to  attract  tourists.  Another  potential  area  for \ndevelopment in Hung Yen is the university zone. Chu Van An University is currently being \nconstructed,  while  Transport  University  and  Foreign  Trade  University  are  preparing  to  open \ncampuses in Hung Yen. \n \n9.  Dong Dang. The Huu Nghi border gate in Dong Dang handles about 70% of freight and \npassenger transits between Viet Nam and the PRC along the NSEC. While total trade in this \nborder  gate  was  valued  at  $859  million,  the  volume  of  passengers  was  recorded  at \n710,606 people in 2010. Since 2000, annual growth rose by an average of 18% in trade and 15% \nin passengers. Trade volume in 2020 is expected to rise to about 10.2 million tons, or $2.78 billion \nin terms of value. Total passenger traffic is expected to reach 1.4 million in the same year. It is \nclear that the existing capacity of the Huu Nghi border gate will not be able to handle such \nexpected increases in trade and passenger traffic. \n \n10.  Related policies and strategies. The project is in line with Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u20132010, which envisions Viet Nam as an industrialized country by 2020.4 \nIn the orientation master plan for urban development to 2020, the government aims to develop \nmodel cities and divert rural migration away from the large cities through the development of \nsecondary cities and strengthening of rural\u2013urban linkages.5 The project will address the GMS \nstrategy to transform transport corridors into full-fledged economic corridors as identified in the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  regional  cooperation  operations  business  plan  for  the \nGMS.6 ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for Viet Nam emphasizes the need \nto target infrastructure investments in small and medium-sized cities, particularly those along \nthe  GMS  economic  corridors.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  priorities  set  forth  in  the \nassessment, strategy, and road map for urban development in Viet Nam. It falls under two \npriority areas: (i) development of corridor cities and towns to contribute to the transformation of \nGMS regional transport corridors into full-fledged economic corridors, and (ii)  development of \nsecondary cities and towns as regional economic hubs to foster balanced regional development \n                                                \n3  The administrative area of Ha Noi was substantially expanded to include the entire Ha Tay Province and Me Linh \nDistrict of Vinh Phuc Province. \n4  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2006.

The  project  design  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport Initiative, Water Policy, and draft urban operational plan under Strategy \n2020.7 \n \n11.  Lessons. Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in urban development include (i) reducing \nimplementation delays by (a) shortening procurement, (b) strengthening the capacity and skills \nof the government project staff, (c) reducing project start-up time, and (d) shortening the time for \nrevising  and finalizing  designs  and  bidding  documents; (ii)  improving consultant quality  by \ncombining international technical capacity with local experience; (iii) preparing more judicious \ncovenants; (iv) strengthening risk analysis; and (v) employing comprehensive corporate and \nbusiness planning as a tool for communicating and agreeing on capacity building.8 The lessons \nwere studied during project preparation and  incorporated in the project design. \n \n12.  Special features. The project has been designed in accordance with the government\u2019s \npolicy  to  decentralize  the  implementation  of  projects  and  programs  funded  by  official \ndevelopment assistance. The provincial and city governments will be primarily responsible for \nproject planning and implementation. Infrastructure improvement in the old town in Hung Yen \nwill  complement  the  government\u2019s  efforts  for  historic  building  preservation  and  catalyze \ncomprehensive redevelopment of the old town. This approach could be replicated in other \nhistoric cities if successful. Upgrading of the Huu Nghi border gate facilities will create great \neconomic  impact  through  increased  trade,  investments,  and  passenger  traffic  between \nViet Nam and the PRC. The project will contribute not only to the local economy, but also to the \ncountry\u2019s overall economy. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be the development of Viet Tri, Hung Yen, and Dong Dang as economic \ncenters in northern Viet Nam to complement Ha Noi. The outcome will be improved urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in Viet Tri, Hung Yen, and Dong Dang. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The project will deliver the following outputs in the three project cities. \n \n(i)  Viet Tri urban roads. The project will construct and improve the western part of \nthe city ring road from the northern dike road to the southern dike road, including \ntwo road sections, which accounts for about one-third of the total city ring road. It \nwill also build a new road from the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai expressway to the city center. \nThe new and improved roads will enhance connections between the Noi Bai\u2013Lao \nCai expressway, Thuy Van industrial zone, and city center, as well as reduce \ntraffic congestion in the central area by diverting the traffic from National Road 2 \nto the city ring road. \n \n(ii)  Viet Tri solid waste management. The project will provide fleet and equipment \nfor collecting solid waste from households and transporting them to the dump site, \nincreasing the current collection volume of 120 tons/day to 150 tons/day. \n \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

The project will upgrade basic infrastructure \nthrough  improvement  of  narrow  and  unpaved  roads  with  provision  of  water \nsupply, wastewater collection and drainage pipes, and utility ducts for electricity \nand telecommunications. This approach could be replicated in the remaining part \nof the old town and other cities that have historic townscape in Viet Nam. \n \n(iv)  Hung Yen urban road. The project will construct approximately 3.3 km road to \nserve  the  proposed  campuses  for  Chu  Van  An  University,  Foreign  Trade \nUniversity, and Transport University, as well as to attract other universities. The \nroad will also serve as an access road for the residential areas currently being \ndeveloped. \n \n(v)  Dong Dang Huu Nghi border gate. This output aims to improve handling of \nimmigration and emigration of cross-border passengers, and custom clearance of \ngoods for import and export at the Huu Nghi border gate. The project will build (a) \noffice  buildings  and  footbridges  connecting  the  office  buildings;  and \n(b) infrastructure  of  the  Huu  Nghi  border  gate  such  as  roads,  including  the \nVietnamese  section  of  the  connecting  road  between  the  Vietnamese  and \nChinese border gates for transportation of goods, drainage, and parking areas.  \n \n(vi)  Dong  Dang  drainage  and  flood  protection.  The  project  will  increase  the \ncapacity of drainage pipelines currently laid along one side of the roads. Flooding \nis  a  common  occurrence  during  heavy  rainfall,  severely  disrupting  market \nactivities. \n \n(vii)  Implementation support, capacity development, and awareness building. \nThe project will (a) help ensure that project implementation will fully comply with \nADB\u2019s  policies  and  operational  requirements  in  terms  of  detailed  designs, \nprocurement,  construction  supervision,  disbursement,  financial  management, \nand  social  and  environmental  safeguards;  (b)  design  and  conduct  capacity \ndevelopment programs in urban planning and management, public infrastructure \nplanning and implementation, operation and maintenance, financial management \nand cost recovery, and environmental management; (c) help local communities \nincrease  awareness  of public  health,  environmental  management,  and  traffic \nsafety; and (d) assist in analytical studies on specific topics including a long-term \nresidential land development plan for Viet Tri, a detailed master plan for the old \ntown in Hung Yen, and potential for public\u2013private partnership at the Huu Nghi \nborder gate facilities in Dong Dang. \n \n15.  Hung Yen wastewater treatment and network. The government has also requested \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea for a loan from the Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea \n(KEXIM) to provide (i) a wastewater treatment plant, (ii) three pumping stations, (iii) a sewer \nnetwork, and (iv) maintenance machinery and equipment. These activities will be implemented in \nparallel  with the project and contribute together to the urban environmental improvement in \nHung Yen. Safeguard documentation, consultation, and disclosure for the KEXIM-financed output \nwill be conducted to satisfy both ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the safeguard \nrequirements of KEXIM. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $115.33 million (Table 1). \n \n ", "5 \n17.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR45,017,000 ($70.00 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.9 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The civil \nworks implementation is focused on quality rather than the quantity of coverage. The designs \nand the operation and maintenance plan are prepared based on appropriate standards to \nensure sustainability. \n \n22.  Government  policy  changes  have  been  made  toward  decentralization  to  delegate \nresponsibilities from the government to the provinces in planning and management of local \nbudget and human resources, as well as land use, public service delivery, state enterprise \nbusiness,  and  natural  resource  control.  The  new  Urban  Planning  Law,  2009  stipulates \ndecentralization  of  urban  planning  responsibilities  to  include  all  government  administration \nlevels and to require stakeholder consultation with concerned organizations, individuals, and \ncommunities. A major challenge is the lack of capacity of local authorities to plan and manage \nurban growth in an integrated manner, plan and operate urban infrastructure effectively, and \ndeliver municipal services efficiently. The project will help strengthen the capacities of local \ngovernments, thus supporting the government\u2019s decentralization policy. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  all  seven  physical  outputs  because  of  the \nuniqueness of each. In undertaking the cost\u2013benefit analysis, a variety of benefit evaluation \nmethods  were  used,  including  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time,  (ii) \nincreased agricultural productivity, (iii) increased tourism revenue, (iv) increased border fee \nrevenue and reduced border clearance time, (v) revenues from sale of waste, (vi) savings on \nwater  provision,  and  (vii)  other  methods.  Given  the  variety  of  the  outputs,  the  expected \nbeneficiaries of the overall project also constitute a diverse group. They include road users, \nfarmers, university students and teachers, tourism service providers, property owners, and \nhouseholds.  The  base  case  results  indicate  all  outputs  are  economically  viable  with  an \nestimated economic internal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%, with the exception of one output which was marginally below that threshold. \nResults ranged from 11.4% to 18.1%, except for the Dong Dang Huu Nghi border gate in which \nthe rate of return was estimated to be significantly higher. Outputs were generally also viable \nunder adverse scenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower (by 10% or 20%) than the \n ", "8 \nbase case. All of the 29 scenarios tested showed an estimated rate of return above 12%, except \nin four cases where the return was between 9.9% and 11.2%. \n \n24.  Given that the project is nonrevenue generating, the financial analysis focused on the \nimplementing  agencies\u2019  financial  capacity  to  meet  the  recurrent  costs  of  operating  and \nmaintaining the developed facilities in a sustainable manner. The overall financial position of \neach  implementing  agency  was  projected,  reflecting  the  incremental  recurrent  costs.  The \nprojected financial positions confirm their financial capacity to cover the recurrent costs to \nsustain  the  facilities  developed  under  the  project.  Moreover,  considering  the  government\u2019s \nassurance that it will fund the operating expenditure and periodic maintenance of the project \nfacilities, adequate budgetary amount for recurrent costs for operation and maintenance is \nreasonably expected. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management assessments reveal no serious obstacles with the accounting \npolicies and procedures followed by the PPCs and CPCs. Based on the procurement capacity \nassessments, the executing and implementing agencies are deemed to have sufficient capacity to \nundertake national competitive bidding for civil works packages. However, considering that they do \nnot have much experience in managing externally funded projects, the project has incorporated \ncapacity  development  programs  for  relevant  staff  in  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the PPCs of Phu Tho, Hung Yen, and Lang Son. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.14 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  Potential social impacts on communities within the project areas have been assessed. \nThe social assessment indicates that the project presents risks with respect to livelihoods, \nHIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  participation,  and  road  safety.  The  project  also \npresents social and economic benefits to local communities in the form of improved mobility, \neconomic  opportunities,  social  development,  and  improved  local  environments.  A  poverty \nreduction and social strategy was prepared to present mitigation measures needed to address \nsocial impacts and enhance distribution of benefits resulting from the project. \n \n28.  The project is categorized under effective gender mainstreaming. The gender analysis \nconcluded that women in the project area are at risk of being disproportionately disadvantaged \nby the project impacts, or not realizing the full potential of project benefits and opportunities if \ngender issues are not mainstreamed in project activities. Accordingly, a gender action plan has \nbeen  prepared  to  (i)  ensure  gender  issues  are  mainstreamed  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation, (ii) address specific impacts and risks that may affect women differently or \ndisproportionately compared to men, (iii) enhance participation of women in project benefits, \nand (iv) build the capacity of the Women\u2019s Union in the project areas to support implementation \nof social development activities of the project. \n \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  B.  This  means  that  potential \nenvironmental impacts of project outputs are relatively minor and can be prevented or mitigated. \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for each project city. An environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) is included with each IEE. The IEEs indicate that potential direct \nenvironmental  impacts  are  mostly  construction-related  and  thus  short-lived.  Environmental \nimpacts  associated  with  the  new  road  developments,  drainage  and  flood  protection, \ninfrastructure upgrading in the old town, and Huu Nghi border gate facilities can be prevented or \nmitigated with standard construction procedures and measures. Similarly, the construction of \nthe new wastewater treatment plant in Hung Yen will follow existing construction practices and \nnorms, and will be operated following existing government standards and guidelines for treated \neffluent discharge and solid waste management. During project implementation, the EMPs will \nbe implemented by the PIUs in conjunction with contractors under the direction of the PIUs. The \nPIUs have adequate capacity and experience and are committed to manage environmental \nrisks. Furthermore, project implementation support and a capacity development program will be \nprovided for the PIUs for implementing the EMPs. \n \n30.  The project is classified under involuntary resettlement  category A. The project will \nrequire the acquisition of approximately 97 hectares (ha) of land in the three project cities, \ncomprising 73 ha in Viet Tri, 17 ha in Hung Yen, and 7 ha in Dong Dang. This will cause the \nphysical and/or economic displacement of an estimated 1,451 households. A resettlement plan \nwas prepared for each project city to address resettlement impacts associated with the project\u2019s \nland  acquisition  requirements  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The \nacquisition of land for the Huu Nghi border gate facilities in Dong Dang commenced prior to the \nproject in accordance with the government\u2019s legislation and practices. The project will need to \nensure that the Safeguard Policy Statement is also met with respect to involuntary resettlement \nfrom this  site.  A resettlement  due  diligence  study  was  undertaken  of  the  affected  land  at \nHuu Nghi border gate and a corrective action plan was prepared to set out supplementary \nactions required to ensure that involuntary resettlement from this location is in compliance with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n31.  The project is classified under indigenous peoples category B. The presence of and \npotential project activity impacts on indigenous peoples and/or ethnic minorities in the project \nareas have been screened. A large proportion of the people in the project area in Dong Dang \nare ethnic minorities who will be affected in a number of ways by the project, while there are no \nethnic  minorities  in  Viet  Tri  and  Hung  Yen.  In  Dong  Dang,  the  construction  of  the  river \nembankment for flood protection, as well as Huu Nghi border gate facilities, will require land \nacquisition and produce displacement. The vendors at Dong Dang market will likely experience \ntemporary disruptions to their livelihoods as a result of drainage civil works. There are risks of \nHIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking to the local ethnic minority population. The project \nalso presents benefits and opportunities to the local population. An ethnic minority development \nplan, in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, has been prepared to fully mitigate the \nrisks and impacts caused to ethnic minorities in the project area in Dong Dang and to promote \ntheir participation and sharing in project benefits. \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements, the \nsafeguard documents are posted on ADB\u2019s website. A grievance redress mechanism has been \ndeveloped  and  included  in  the  safeguard  documents  to  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints \nregarding the performance of the project. \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The key project risks include (i) limited economic development in the project cities, (ii) \ncatastrophic climate events (typhoons and flooding), (iii) limited project implementation capacity, \nand (iv) complex project implementation arrangements. The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk management plan.15 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited economic development  in  Project outputs have been identified based on an urban and regional \nproject cities  analysis to ensure that they support a well-defined city development \nstrategy in each project city. \nProject facilities damaged by natural  The use of robust designs and good construction quality control will \ndisasters such as typhoons and flooding  reduce the vulnerability of the urban infrastructure to catastrophic climate \nevents. \nLimited implementation capacities at the  The project preparatory TA will provide start-up support, and the loan \nprovincial and city levels to meet all  consultants will provide capacity strengthening and training for local \nADB and project requirements  government agencies. \nComplexity in coordinating many PIUs  One team of the loan consultants will be engaged to assist all PIUs in \ninvolved in project implementation  project implementation to facilitate effective coordination. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIU = project implementation unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project design and monitoring framework \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  The government and the PPCs of Phu Tho, Hung Yen, and Lang Son have assured \nADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan \ndocuments. \n \n35.  The government and the PPCs of Phu Tho, Hung Yen, and Lang Son have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.
