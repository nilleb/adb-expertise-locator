INTRODUCTION \n1  During the preparation of the loan for the Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural \nDevelopment Project (the Project) in 2007, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ncapacity building to support implementation of the Project. The TA will improve the capacity of \nstakeholders to implement the Project by mainstreaming an integrated ecosystem management \n(IEM) approach to achieving sound environmental benefits and sustainable rural livelihoods in \nthe project area. The TA will also assist governments in identifying and replicating successful \nmodules and approaches in similar regions within the PRC. \n \n2  An ADB mission (the Mission) visited Ningxia province intermittently during October\u2013\nNovember 2007 for TA fact-finding, conducted discussions with the Ministry of Finance, and \nreached an understanding with the Government of the PRC (the Government) on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost and financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1 The design \nand monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n3  ADB is preparing the Project jointly with the government of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion  (NHAR),  which  will  aim  to  improve  environmental  management  for  ecosystem \nrehabilitation, in support of sustainable rural incomes in the project area. Project interventions \nwill introduce an IEM approach to provide sustainable livelihoods for the population in the \ntargeted area. Components under the Project include: (i) building IEM and project management \ncapacity, (ii) land and water resource management, (iii) improving rural livelihoods, and (iv) \nbiodiversity and ecosystem conservation. The Ningxia Finance Department (NFD) will be the \nexecuting agency (EA) on behalf of the NHAR government. The Ningxia project management \noffice (NPMO) will cover day-to-day administrative tasks. A lead group has been established \nand will oversee and coordinate government agencies responsible for institutional and sector \npriorities.2 The Project will be implemented by four implementing agencies (IAs) and will include \nstate-owned enterprises and state-sponsored public sector bureaus as project implementation \nunits to carry out the subprojects.  \n \n4  As ADB\u2019s first demonstrative investment project under the PRC\u2013Global Environment \nFund (GEF) Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems,3 the Project aims to \ndevelop models that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and can be replicated in other \ndegraded ecosystems using IEM approaches. The Project is also the first ever large-scale \ninvestment to demonstrate IEM practices in the PRC. If successful, it will have a significant \nimpact with respect to the removal of institutional and technical barriers to the management of \nnatural resources and ecosystems, and showcase sustainable means of balancing economic \ndevelopment and environmental conservation. The Project will also contribute to new policies \nfor rural regeneration under the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan for Social and Economic \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 December 2007. \n2  The lead group is chaired by the responsible vice chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Government \nand  comprises  director  general-level  officials  from  relevant  agencies  for  finance,  development  and  reform, \nagriculture and animal husbandry, water resources, land and resources, forestry, environmental protection, poverty \nreduction, and the Yinchuan Municipal Government.  \n3  The PRC-GEF Partnership is a long-term country programming framework (CPF) that was approved by GEF\u2019s \ncouncil in October 2002. The CPF covers a 10-year period (2003\u20132012) and seeks to combat land degradation, \nreduce poverty, and conserve biodiversity through capacity building investments and developing viable model \ninvestment projects (consistent with GEF\u2019s Operational Program 12 on integrated ecosystem management). The \nproposed NIEADP is the first investment project developed under the CPF.   \n ", "2   \nDevelopment (2006\u20132010). However, the use of IEM principles and approaches is new in the \nPRC and successful implementation of the Project is a big challenge for institutions that were \nnot designed for integrated approaches. These weaknesses are compounded by the limited \ncapacity of the EA and IAs. Consequently, there is a need to build the implementation capacity \nof the EA and IAs, and to strengthen institutional capacity to achieve effective coordination \nbetween sectors.  \n \n5  First, it is essential to define the roles and responsibilities of government agencies \ninvolved in the Project, including EA and IAs, and other project stakeholders. The NHAR \ngovernment has formed a lead group that will ensure coordination across sectors and undertake \nto make decisions regarding key project plans, strategies, and policy issues. The lead group \ncomprises senior officials from sector agencies (including planning, finance, agriculture, water \nresources, land resources, environmental management, and  forestry) and municipal/county \ngovernments. The lead group has already been active in coordinating projects funded by the \nother donors and the mechanism has proven effective in coordinating multi-sectoral projects. \nExisting coordination relies on political instructions, however, with only limited use of scientific \nprinciples  to  resolve  conflicts  or  competing  interests.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional capacity of the lead group through well-designed workshops and training to ensure \nexisting mechanisms more effectively incorporate scientific assessments in (i) the coordination \nof project implementation, and (ii) the provision of guidance to enhance the sustainability of \nfuture ecological and economic development. \n \n6  Second, there is a substantial need for EA and IA staff to build their capacity to design, \nmanage, implement, monitor, and operate project interventions. None of the IAs have previous \nexperience in implementing ADB and donor projects and currently lack IEM knowledge and \noperational capacity in terms of project management and safeguard policies. ADB\u2019s previous \nsupport4 has raised awareness of IEM among a relatively limited number of government officials, \nplanners and technical experts. However, effective use of the IEM approaches and successful \nimplementation of the Project require a critical mass of people with a good understanding of IEM \nand the capacity to plan and implement field-level interventions that aim to restore, sustain and \nenhance the productivity of ecosystem resources. Although there is increasing recognition \namong the EA and IAs that there are major problems to be addressed, they currently lack \nexposure to successful IEM-related practices and a detailed understanding of the ecosystems in \nthe project area, as well as the economic value of the ecosystem functions and services \nprovided. Lack of understanding and exposure to modern scientifically-based approaches5 to \nenvironmental management poses a significant risk to the success of the Project. Training is \nneeded to improve EA and IA staff knowledge and skills to implement such an integrated and \ncomplicated project in a scientific and professional manner.   \n \n7  Third, the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will allow the EA \nand  IAs  to  easily  monitor  project  implementation  progress,  evaluate  project  impacts, \ndisseminate best project practices, and replicate models in other places and sectors. The M&E \nsystem can also identify project success stories and showcase the best examples of value \nadditions to promote, transfer, disseminate, and support the uptake of knowledge, technology, \nbest practices, and reform initiatives for possible replication and/or spillover to other provinces \nor entities.  \n                                                 \n4  These supports include (i) the ADB-GEF Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project and (ii) the project \npreparatory TA to prepare the loan of Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural Development Project.  \n5  Scientific approaches include bottom-up management, cross-sectoral coordination, decision making based on M&E, \nand adaptive technologies and methods.      \n ", "  3\n \n8  The  proposed  TA  will  support  the  development  of  capacity  to  assist  the  NHAR \ngovernment to operationalize the IEM principles that underpin the Project and government \nprograms. It will reduce the impact of the perceived complexity of the Project and improve the \ncapacity of the EA and IAs to practice and mainstream integrated approaches. The proposed \nTA will improve IEM knowledge and the capacity of the EA and IAs through learning-by-doing as \nthey implement the Project.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9  The impact of the TA will be an improved institutional enabling environment to manage \necosystems  through  integrated  approaches  in  Ningxia.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be \nstrengthened capacity of the EA and IAs to implement, manage, monitor, and operate the \nProject. The TA will support the use of increasingly coordinated decision making necessary to \nimplement the Project and identify and widely disseminate replicable models.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10  To support achievement of the outcome and contribute to the longer-term impact, the \nTA\u2019s key outputs will be (i) establishment of the coordination mechanism to support the existing \nlead  group  by  clearly  defining  the  responsibilities  of  the  line  agencies  involved  in  loan \nimplementation; (ii) development of training programs, training materials and training workshops \nfor project planning, implementation, and management involving IEM principles and practices; \n(iii)  development  of  expertise,  knowledge  products,  and  human  resources  for  managing \nimplementation and then sustaining the operation of interventions by the EA and IAs; and (iv) \nestablishment of an M&E system to support sustainable project management by the EA and IAs.  \n \n11  Major  activities  under  the  first  output  will  include  (i)  reviewing  and  assessing \nresponsibilities of line agencies involved in the IEM and identifying measures to break through \ninstitutional barriers and improve coordination; (ii) preparing and delivering awareness-raising \nseminars and training for senior decision makers and the lead group members; (iii) holding an \ninternational workshop on integrated water resources management, particularly focusing on \nirrigation management in the Yinchuan Plain; and (iv) conducting an IEM study tour to the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/GEF IEM project in Xiamen involving member \nagencies of the lead group. \n \n12  The second output will build capacity of  the EA and IAs to implement the Project \neffectively by: (i) conducting problem tree analysis through participatory workshops to reduce \nthe perceived complexity of the IEM approach and speed implementation of the Project; (ii) \nassisting the EA to coordinate IAs and the other stakeholders and prepare work plans on time \nfor project implementation and for planning procurement, disbursement, financial management, \nresettlement and environmental monitoring and reporting; (iii) conducting training workshops on \nselected  technical  topics  for  IAs  and  farmers  (e.g.,  irrigation  management,  wetlands \nconservation,  biodiversity,  grassland,  animal  husbandry,  the  wine  industry,  orchards,  and \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmarketing); (iv) delivering training workshops on operational skills for the EA and IAs in terms of \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nADB policies and requirements, including procurement, disbursement, financial management, \nresettlement, environment, and project performance management systems; and (v) designing \nand conducting study tours for key project staff in the EA and IAs.  \n ", "4   \n \n13  The third output activities will include (i) identifying four to six specific research topics \nrelating to the Project based on a needs assessment, and contracting for the agreed upon \nstudies;6 (ii) developing staff exchange programs, primarily for IAs, and supporting fixed-term \ntraining for three to five staff members from selected IAs; (iii) developing both generic and \nsector-specific training materials; and (iv) identifying appropriate local experts to establish a pool \nof expertise for the development of future trainers. \n \n14  The fourth output will develop an M&E system to help the EA manage the loan project \nmore proactively and sustainably. NPMO and the IAs can easily use the system to document \nbest project practices and successful modules, so as to facilitate replication of these in other \nregions  with  similar  conditions,  and  to  establish  databases  supporting  policy  making  for \nscientific management of ecosystems. Major activities will comprise (i) designing a framework \nfor the M&E system and establishing a baseline database, (ii) preparing briefing materials and \nbrochures  for  information  disclosure  and  dissemination,  and  (iii)  conducting  showcase \nworkshops in the other parts of Ningxia to share project experiences and lessons.  \n \n15  The expected results and deliverables include (i) a training action plan to guide capacity \nbuilding activities (e.g., workshops, seminars, training, study tours, and specific studies); (ii) a \nreport on capacity assessment and training needs; (iii) a set of training materials, including \npublic education publications; (iv) one international workshop on integrated water management, \nparticularly focusing on participatory irrigation management and water use efficiency; (v) a \nseries of training workshops on project implementation-related issues, and seminars on specific \ntechnical topics to promote understanding of IEM and its practices; (vi) study tours to visit other \nsuccessful projects and approaches; (vii) a workshop to showcase lessons and experience to \nimplement  integrated  projects;  (viii)  a  dynamic  M&E  system  that  can  be  easily  used  and \nmaintained by the EA and IAs to manage the loan project; and (viii) a pool of expertise and \ntrainers, composed mainly of local experts.  \n \n16  Knowledge products and services (KPS) can be obtained through TA implementation. \nMajor KPS will include seminar and/or workshop materials, study reports and/or published \npapers, the M&E system, and media reporting. Knowledge\u2014including best practices, successful \nproject stories, and replicable modules from loan design and implementation\u2014will also be \ndocumented by the EA and IAs, and can be further shared and publicized in other areas with \nsimilar conditions. All KPS will be made available through appropriate channels. A detailed \ndissemination plan will be developed at the beginning phase of the TA.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 \non a grant basis through its TA funding program. ADB financing will cover consulting services, \ninternational and local travel, reports and communications, workshops, training and study tours, \nadministration  and  support  costs  including  translation  expenses,  and  contingencies.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000  equivalent,  to  cover  the  remuneration  of \ncounterpart staff, some local transport costs, the provision of office accommodation, and other \nlogistical support costs. The detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6  The research topic criteria and the methodology to select the entities to perform the research will be developed in \nassociation with the EA. The contracting of the studies will be done in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18  The Ningxia Finance Department will be the Executing Agency for the TA. NPMO will \ncover detailed administrative tasks during the implementation period. The existing lead group \nwill coordinate institutional and sector matters as required and ensure the TA contributes to the \nProject\u2019s long-term impact. The EA will ensure effective coordination between the TA and \nconsultants to be engaged under the Project. The funds for workshops and seminars will be \nadministered by the EA, and an advance payment facility will be considered under the TA.  \n \n19  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 36 months from May 2008 to May \n2011, and will overlap with the implementation period of the Project. A detail working schedule \nwill be developed at the inception phase. A total of 45 person-months of consulting services will \nbe engaged under the TA, which includes 5 person-months of international consultant services \nand 40 person-months of national consultant services. Indicative consulting services will include \n(i) a domestic capacity development expert and workshop facilitator to develop the training \nprogram, conduct participatory workshops, and organize seminars, who will act as team leader \nand coordinate TA activities and liaise closely with ADB and the EA; (ii) an international training \nspecialist to work with the team leader to prepare the training program, and in particular to \ndesign the international workshop on integrated water resources management; and (iii) an \ninternational and domestic monitoring and evaluation specialist to design the M&E system, \nincluding development of operational guidelines and a baseline database. Specific resource \npersons will be engaged on an as needed basis. Appendix 3 describes detailed terms of \nreference for the envisaged consulting services.  \n \n20  ADB, in consultation with the EA, will select and engage consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultants will be recruited on an individual basis due to (i) the range of expertise required on a \nshort-term basis; (ii) the importance of individual qualifications and experience; and (iii) the \nnature of the assignments, which can be completed largely on an individual basis without the \nneed for extra support from the consultant\u2019s home office. All consultants are required to work in \nYinchuan of the NHAR during TA implementation. Reports on major milestones (i.e., inception, \nmid-term, and final reports) will be produced by the team leader. The other consultants will \nprepare reports for major events on a case-by-case basis.  \nIV.
