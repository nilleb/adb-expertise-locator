INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Country Programming Mission in January 1994, the Government\nrequested the Bank to provide technical assistance (TA) to prepare a project to improve facilities\nat Siem Reap Airport and Kang Keng Airport (formerly Sihanoukville). A Bank Mission visited\nCambodia from 7-20 June 1994 and reached an understanding with the Government on the\nscope of the TA for the feasibility study for the project.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Kingdom of Cambodia has a land area of approximately 181,000 square\nkilometers and an estimated population of 12 million. The country has been troubled by internal\nstrife for many decades. This environment of political unrest has restricted the development of\nbasic infrastructure in many areas such as water supply, electricity supply, sewerage, roads, and\ntransport. The civil aviation sector has been hampered by the lack of funds for development\nwork and a serious shortage of trained personnel. In Cambodia, land transport is unreliable,\ntedious and slow because of the poor road conditions and is sometimes dangerous. An\nalternative that has high priority is reliable and safe air transport and facilities that can be\nprovided relatively quickly and at a minimum cost. These facilities are needed to support the\nre-establishment of Government administrative services, the promotion of regional economic\nintegration and political stability and the ongoing and planned initiatives in urban development,\nand tourism. In addition, the Third Conference on Subregional Economic Cooperation (SEC)2,\nagreed on the importance of maintaining a continuous exchange of information on airport and\ncivil aviation projects in the light of subregional and global systems. One of the projects selected\nas having significant subregional importance and in need of immediate study is Kang Keng\nAirport. The Siem Reap Airport is also important because it is the main domestic airport in the\nnorthwest part of the country.\n3. The country's air transport network comprises an international airport (Pochentong\nInternational Airport), in Phnom Penh; two major domestic airports, Siem Reap and Kang Keng;\nand six minor airports Stung Treng, Rattanak Kin, Preah Vihear, Koh Kong, Mondol Kin and\nBattambang. Presently, air travel to Siem Reap and Kang Keng is quite risky because of the\nlimited landing and navigational facilities available. The existing equipment at these airports\nis old and not reliable and spare parts are difficult to obtain. In addition, the existing parking\naprons, fire services, and runways are in need of urgent repairs. With the expected rise in air\ntravel, the demand on these airports will increase and the probability of a serious accident also\nincreases. An immediate concern of the Government is to improve the operating safety levels\nand to ensure compliance with the operational standards set by the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO). The two major domestic airports, Siem Reap and Kang Keng are also\nmajor gateways to recognized international tourist destinations. The Siem Reap Airport serves\nas the entry point by air for Angkor Wat (a historical site included in the World Heritage List)\nand the Kang Keng Airport supports trade and commercial development and the recreational\nseaside resorts in the sourthwest part of the country. Both sites served by the two airports are\nconsidered to be major tourist destinations and the improved accessibility provided by the\nThis TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  in August 1994.\nRETA No 5535: Promoting Subregional Cooperation Among Cambodia, the Peoples's Republic of China,\nLao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, for $600,000, approved on 1 June\n1993.\nSI -.\t- -", "2\nairport is in line with the recommendations made for promoting the subregion as a tourist\ndestination in the SEC study.\n4. In Cambodia, several international agencies have been active in the development\nof civil aviation. In the past, technical assistance has been provided by the United Nations (UN),\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), ICAO, and the Governments of France,\nMalaysia, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the former Soviet Union. The UN supplied\nnavigational and communication equipment that was used during its peacekeeping mission\nassociated with the 1993 UN sponsored elections. The UNDP and ICAO have provided\nassistance to airport operation training subsequent to the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping\nforces. The Governments of France and Malaysia have provided navigational, communication\nand fire fighting equipment. The PRC and the former Soviet Union have provided assistance\nin the construction of airport infrastructure. In addition, to the assistance already provided by\nthe various aid agencies, the Government of France is currently in the process of providing\nassistance for the preparation of a feasibility study for Pochentong International Airport. The\nproposed TA will be coordinated with the French assistance through liaison by the Bank, the\nMinistry of Public Transport (MPST) and potential co-financiers.\n5. The civil aviation sector is managed by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Kingdom\nof Cambodia (CAAKC), which is temporarily a line agency in the Secretariat of the Prime\nMinister's Office. However, MPST is responsible for all Government civil engineering\nconstruction works including airports. CAAKC concentrates on the operations of the airports\nand regulatory requirements of the civil aviation sector.\n6. Air transportation is a key component in the development of the country's\neconomy and is closely linked to the development of the tourism industry. The project is\njustified because of the urgent requirement (i) to improve the conditions of the existing civil\naviation facilities and to establish safe operating procedures that conform with ICAO standards,\n(ii) to provide a safe and reliable mode of transport, and (iii) to support the Government's\nstrategy to stimulate the country's economic growth by providing air transportation to facilitate\nthe mobilization of social, economic, and administrative resources.\n7. The volume of air traffic through Siem Reap and Kang Keng airports is low, not\nbecause of the lack of demand, but because the two airports are not safe. With minimal\nimprovements to bring them up to basic ICAO standards, it is expected that traffic will increase\nsignificantly. Nevertheless, the viability of the proposed projects need to be carefully assessed.\nAccordingly, the TA is designed to produce a staged development plan that will be implemented\nover time and in line with the project's revenue generating capacity. The principal outputs of\nthe TA will be detailed airport master plans (AMPs) for physical infrastructure for 1995-2005 for\nthe Siem Reap Airprrarrd the Kang Keng Airport, with a prioritized schedule of suitable\ndevelopments, outline designs and feasibility studies for the more urgent of these, and the\ndevelopment of a suitable financing and implementation plan.\nIll. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will address the priority of\ninfrastructure development for Siem Reap Airport and Kang Keng Airport and will review", "3\ninstitutional and policy issues associated with the civil aviation sector. The PPTA will assist the\nGovernment and CAAKC to identify priority areas for further investment and to prepare one or\nmore project(s) suitable for Bank assistance. In doing this, it will address the feasibility and\nimmediate requirements for upgrading the airports to ICAO appropriate Code C operational\nstandards and produce an AMP for the staging of development in line with forecast demand up\nto the airports' ultimate capacity.\nB.\t Scope\n9.\t Specifically, the objectives of the PPTA are to assist CAAKC to:\ndevelop AMPs that will provide a sound basis for the future development\nand investment in airport related facilities. The AMPs will include a costed\nand staged development plan which will be consistent with ICAO Annex\n14 standards. The AMPs will cover airspace and navigation facilities;\nii. develop a time-based schedule of development in line with forecast\ndemand and at an appropriate level of service to operators and users;\niii. prepare detailed feasibility plans including broad designs (which would\ntake into consideration among others, environmental and social issues),\nfor the proposed airport improvements and from them develop estimates\nof cost;\niv. prepare a feasibility analysis for the proposed airport improvements in a\nmanner and form suitable for assessment by the Bank and other external\nagencies,\nv. make recommendations on institutional and policy matters, including\namong others, operations and maintenance procedures, pricing policies,\ncost recovery; and,\nvi. develop suitable procurement procedures to facilitate project\nimplementation.\nC.\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $520,000 (see Appendix 1). The Bank\nwill provide $500,000 initially as a grant. The TA will be charged to the Bank-funded technical\nassistance program. The Government will provide the remaining $20,000 in the form of\ncounterpart staff, office space, some local transportation, and administrative support. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not necessarily commit the Bank\nto finance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. The services under the TA are scheduled to commence in February 1995 and\nexpected to be completed by May 1995. The principal output will be a prioritized schedule of\ninfrastructure improvements and a recommendation on a staged development plan.

A final report will be prepared within one month of receiving comments\nfrom CAAKC and the Bank on the draft final report. The terms of reference for consulting\nservices are given in Appendix 2.\n12. It is envisaged that international staffing inputs will be about 16 person months\nof international specialists with expertise in airport planning, civil engineering, communication\nand navigational aids, environment, transport economics, and financial analysis. The domestic\nconsultant input will be about three person months in the fields of civil engineering and cost\nestimating. The consultants will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants.\n13. The Executing Agency for the proposed TA will be MPST. The Minister of MPST\nwill appoint the Under Secretary of State for CAAKC to have overall responsibility for the TA and\nto provide day-to-day coordination. A steering committee comprising representatives from\nMPST, CAAKC, users and operators, and the consultant will be established. The steering\ncommittee will coordinate discussions with interested organizations, including CAAKC's other\noperational divisions, airline operators, customs, and concessionaires. This committee will also\nreview the plans and other documents prepared by the consultants and provide comments and\ninputs as necessary.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance to the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 for the purpose of the Airports\nImprovement Project, and hereby reports his action to the Board. This technical assistance will\nbe made available initially as a grant, but will be subject to the reimbursement arrangements set\nforth in the relevant Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (DOC.

The Governments of France and Malaysia have provided navigational, communication\nand fire fighting equipment. The PRC and the former Soviet Union have provided assistance\nin the construction of airport infrastructure. In addition, to the assistance already provided by\nthe various aid agencies, the Government of France is currently in the process of providing\nassistance for the preparation of a feasibility study for Pochentong International Airport. The\nproposed TA will be coordinated with the French assistance through liaison by the Bank, the\nMinistry of Public Transport (MPST) and potential co-financiers.\n5. The civil aviation sector is managed by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Kingdom\nof Cambodia (CAAKC), which is temporarily a line agency in the Secretariat of the Prime\nMinister's Office. However, MPST is responsible for all Government civil engineering\nconstruction works including airports. CAAKC concentrates on the operations of the airports\nand regulatory requirements of the civil aviation sector.\n6. Air transportation is a key component in the development of the country's\neconomy and is closely linked to the development of the tourism industry. The project is\njustified because of the urgent requirement (i) to improve the conditions of the existing civil\naviation facilities and to establish safe operating procedures that conform with ICAO standards,\n(ii) to provide a safe and reliable mode of transport, and (iii) to support the Government's\nstrategy to stimulate the country's economic growth by providing air transportation to facilitate\nthe mobilization of social, economic, and administrative resources.\n7. The volume of air traffic through Siem Reap and Kang Keng airports is low, not\nbecause of the lack of demand, but because the two airports are not safe. With minimal\nimprovements to bring them up to basic ICAO standards, it is expected that traffic will increase\nsignificantly. Nevertheless, the viability of the proposed projects need to be carefully assessed.\nAccordingly, the TA is designed to produce a staged development plan that will be implemented\nover time and in line with the project's revenue generating capacity. The principal outputs of\nthe TA will be detailed airport master plans (AMPs) for physical infrastructure for 1995-2005 for\nthe Siem Reap Airprrarrd the Kang Keng Airport, with a prioritized schedule of suitable\ndevelopments, outline designs and feasibility studies for the more urgent of these, and the\ndevelopment of a suitable financing and implementation plan.\nIll. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will address the priority of\ninfrastructure development for Siem Reap Airport and Kang Keng Airport and will review", "3\ninstitutional and policy issues associated with the civil aviation sector. The PPTA will assist the\nGovernment and CAAKC to identify priority areas for further investment and to prepare one or\nmore project(s) suitable for Bank assistance. In doing this, it will address the feasibility and\nimmediate requirements for upgrading the airports to ICAO appropriate Code C operational\nstandards and produce an AMP for the staging of development in line with forecast demand up\nto the airports' ultimate capacity.\nB.\t Scope\n9.\t Specifically, the objectives of the PPTA are to assist CAAKC to:\ndevelop AMPs that will provide a sound basis for the future development\nand investment in airport related facilities. The AMPs will include a costed\nand staged development plan which will be consistent with ICAO Annex\n14 standards. The AMPs will cover airspace and navigation facilities;\nii. develop a time-based schedule of development in line with forecast\ndemand and at an appropriate level of service to operators and users;\niii. prepare detailed feasibility plans including broad designs (which would\ntake into consideration among others, environmental and social issues),\nfor the proposed airport improvements and from them develop estimates\nof cost;\niv. prepare a feasibility analysis for the proposed airport improvements in a\nmanner and form suitable for assessment by the Bank and other external\nagencies,\nv. make recommendations on institutional and policy matters, including\namong others, operations and maintenance procedures, pricing policies,\ncost recovery; and,\nvi. develop suitable procurement procedures to facilitate project\nimplementation.\nC.\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $520,000 (see Appendix 1). The Bank\nwill provide $500,000 initially as a grant. The TA will be charged to the Bank-funded technical\nassistance program. The Government will provide the remaining $20,000 in the form of\ncounterpart staff, office space, some local transportation, and administrative support. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not necessarily commit the Bank\nto finance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. The services under the TA are scheduled to commence in February 1995 and\nexpected to be completed by May 1995. The principal output will be a prioritized schedule of\ninfrastructure improvements and a recommendation on a staged development plan. Prior to the\nformulation of the staged development plan, a tripartite meeting of staff from the Bank, CAAKC\nciration n1 nni,tii\t iit,\t I\t _TTT.TZT\t ml", "4\nand the consultants will be held to review the schedule of improvements and to finalize the\nimmediate infrastructure improvements before the preparation of the staged development plan.\nThe consultant will produce an inception report within one month of commencing the services,\nan interim report prior to the preparation of the staged development plan and a draft final report\nat the end of the study. A final report will be prepared within one month of receiving comments\nfrom CAAKC and the Bank on the draft final report. The terms of reference for consulting\nservices are given in Appendix 2.\n12. It is envisaged that international staffing inputs will be about 16 person months\nof international specialists with expertise in airport planning, civil engineering, communication\nand navigational aids, environment, transport economics, and financial analysis. The domestic\nconsultant input will be about three person months in the fields of civil engineering and cost\nestimating. The consultants will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants.\n13. The Executing Agency for the proposed TA will be MPST. The Minister of MPST\nwill appoint the Under Secretary of State for CAAKC to have overall responsibility for the TA and\nto provide day-to-day coordination. A steering committee comprising representatives from\nMPST, CAAKC, users and operators, and the consultant will be established. The steering\ncommittee will coordinate discussions with interested organizations, including CAAKC's other\noperational divisions, airline operators, customs, and concessionaires. This committee will also\nreview the plans and other documents prepared by the consultants and provide comments and\ninputs as necessary.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance to the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 for the purpose of the Airports\nImprovement Project, and hereby reports his action to the Board.
