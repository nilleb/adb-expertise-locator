The proposed project for additional financing involves implementing a carbon capture, \nutilization, and storage (CCUS) pilot project at the Tianjin integrated gasification combined cycle \n(IGCC) power plant to test pre-combustion capture of up to 100,000 tons per year of carbon \ndioxide (CO ), its utilization for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and geological sequestration. This \n2\nCCUS pilot project will be the first complete one at an IGCC power plant in a developing \ncountry.1 The unique lessons learned and important knowledge shall be shared with the national \nand international stakeholders. Based on the consensus reached with the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the China Huaneng Group (CHNG), and the Huaneng Clean \nEnergy Research Institute (HNCERI) regarding the medium-term operation of the proposed \nproject, appropriate financial support arrangements for the pilot project need to be finalized. The \npilot project to be funded under the proposed grant would be subject to technical, financial, \neconomic, and environmental due diligence prior to the approval of the grant. A regional project \npreparatory technical assistance (R-PPTA) of $800,000 is required to undertake the above \nmentioned tasks. The government has been advised that the approval of the PPTA does not \ncommit Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the ensuing grant. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.
