Investment Identification and Description \n \n                                                \n1  The project team will seek endorsement from ADB\u201fs Investment Committee on pricing and material terms based on \nan updated financial analysis prior to ADB entering into the loan agreement with Inecobank. ", "2 \n \n2.  In most developing countries, SMEs act as an important engine of growth and a key \ncontributor to poverty reduction by creating employment, increasing individual incomes, and \ngenerating tax revenues. In Armenia, in 2009 SMEs accounted for 97.7% of businesses, and \ncontributed  42.5%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  42.2%  of  employment, \nrepresenting a doubling of the SME contribution to the economy since 1999.2  The SME share \nof Armenia\u201fs export volume has also risen, reaching 17.9% in 2009 from 14.3% in 2003. SMEs \nhave made a significant contribution to the creation of new jobs in the country, particularly \noutside the capital Yerevan.  \n \n3.  Providing financial support to SMEs in the form of medium- and long-term funding is \nessential  for  SMEs  to  invest  in  the  technology  and  capital  they  need  to  increase  their \nproductivity and competitiveness. However, access to finance remains a major obstacle for a \nmajority of businesses in Armenia. 3 Armenia relies heavily on remittances as a source of \ncapital,  and  this  is  particularly  true  for  informal  SMEs.  The  global  economic  slowdown, \nparticularly as it affects the Russian Federation, may slow growth in remittances and this \nsource of financing is not likely to be as reliable as it was prior to the crisis.4 Moreover, private \nsector credit was only 23.7% of GDP in 2009 and 27.1% of GDP in 2010, lower than Armenia\u201fs \nsimilarly rated peers and other countries in the region.5 Much of the recent increase in bank \nlending has not reached SMEs, especially outside Yerevan. Historically, banks have been \ndisinclined to lend other than to large top-tier enterprises, citing lack of collateral, poor business \nplans, and lack of transparency on the part of prospective borrowers.  \n \n4.  Bank loans are the dominant form of external financing for SMEs in Armenia. Banks look \nto SMEs to diversify their loan portfolios and improve interest margins. The growth in SME \nfinancing has been supported by development finance institutions (DFIs), such as German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), and the World Bank, through the provision of funds and \ntechnical assistance (TA) to Armenian banks. However, SME financing remains inadequate, \nand the financing gap is expected to increase as a result of the expiry of some DFI facilities, \ncoupled with past SME unmet funding needs, continued growth of the SME sector, and limited \nability of the banks to raise medium-term funds. The local bond market is underdeveloped and \ndormant, and local banks are only able to obtain facilities from international commercial banks \non a short-term basis or linked to specific projects.  \n \n5.  Armenia was identified as a candidate for an ADB-supported SME financing program \nbecause of the financial obstacles experienced by its SMEs, its banking sector\u201fs relatively good \nhealth and their readiness to accept such facilities, and ADB\u201fs goal to expand its private sector \noperations in the region and reach more A and B countries6. SME term facilities are being \noffered to several banks simultaneously to (i) increase the development impact of the program \non the overall market; (ii) enable creditworthy banks that have experience in providing financing \nto SMEs to compete, as much as possible, on an equal basis; and (iii) diversify ADB\u201fs exposure \nto Armenian banks. Four banks were selected for the program based on their (i) desire and \n                                                \n2   Small  and  Medium  Entrepreneurship  Development  National  Center  of  Armenia.  2010.

Washington, DC \n(December). \n4   In 2010 remittances increased 15.4% to $1.1 billion after weakening in 2009, though this is below the 2008 level of \n$1.4 billion. \n5  Armenia is rated BB\u2013 by Fitch. The median ratio of private credit to GDP is 36% for BB-rated countries and 27% for \nB-rated countries. In 2009, the ratio was 35% for Caucasus and Central Asia, 75% for Central and Eastern Europe, \nand 163% for OECD countries. \n6  ADB. 2010 Classification and Graduation of Developing Member Countries.

Each bank has loans from other IFIs, but in \naggregate these loans fall short of the banks\u201f projected SME lending pipeline. The program will \nallow  ADB  to  develop  partnerships  with  key  Armenian  banks  to  further  financial  sector \ndevelopment. The program is ADB\u201fs first activity (public or private) in the country to promote \nSMEs.   \n \n6.  ACBA Credit Agricole Bank. Ranked first in Armenia in terms of total assets, lending, \nand capital as of the end of 2010, ACBA Credit Agricole Bank (ACBA) is the leader in lending to \nthe agriculture sector with over 51% share of the market.7 Loans to SMEs accounted for 44% of \nthe bank\u201fs portfolio at the end of Q2 2011. ADB and ACBA have been discussing possible areas \nof collaboration since 2007. ACBA was selected based on its large branch network, particularly \noutside of Yerevan, its large SME loan book, and its relatively long history as a major bank in \nArmenia. \n \n7.  Ardshininvestbank. As Armenia\u201fs fifth-largest bank in terms of assets and fourth in \nterms  of  capital  and  deposits  in  2010,  Ardshininvestbank  (ASHIB)  has  the  largest  branch \nnetwork outside Yerevan and it is the second-largest lender to industry and agriculture (footnote \n7). Loans to SMEs as a share of ASHIB\u201fs portfolio grew to 32.9% at the end of Q2 2011. ADB \nand ASHIB began discussing possible partnerships in 2008. ASHIB was selected based on its \nbranch network, its strong customer base in both agriculture and industry, and history as a \nmajor bank in Armenia. \n \n8.  Ameriabank. As the second-largest bank in Armenia in terms of assetsand capital in \n2010, Ameriabank (Ameria) is the top lender to industry and the transport and communication \nsector.  Loans to SMEs represented 21.4% of Ameria\u201fs portfolio at the end of Q2 2011. Ameria \napproached ADB in early 2010 to look for opportunities to collaborate. Ameria was selected due \nto its progressive management that is committed to adopting international best practices, its \ndemonstrated ability to execute its stated strategy, and its desire to expand its SME portfolio. \n \n9.  Inecobank. Ranked 12th for assets and 10th for lending in 2010, Inecobank (Ineco) has \ntraditionally supported micro and small enterprises. Its SME portfolio  is about the same size as \nthe largest banks. It was among the first in the market to apply cash-flow analysis in its lending \npractices. ADB provided a $3 million, 4-year loan to Ineco in 2008 as part of a program to \nsupport microfinance institutions and small business banks. Ineco was selected based on its \ngood track record with ADB and its ongoing commitment to provide financial services to lower-\nincome segments of the population.  \n \nB.  Business Overview, Ownership, and Strategy \n10.  ACBA. ACBA was established in 1996 with help from the European Union and Credit \nAgricole, the bank\u201fs largest shareholder (28% ownership). Remaining shares belong to 10 \nagricultural cooperatives from all regions of Armenia. While the bank began with the distribution \nof very short-term micro-loans to farmers, it started issuing loans to SMEs in 1999 and is now a \nuniversal bank offering a full range of services through 41 branches across all of Armenia\u201fs \nprovinces.  ACBA\u201fs  strategy  continues  to  be  focused  on  agriculture  (farms  and  farmers). \nHowever, loans to SMEs as a customer segment (including SMEs in agribusiness) has grown to \nmake up the largest share of the bank\u201fs portfolio and it strives to maintain its market leadership \nin small business financing products and leasing. ACBA is rated Ba3 (stable) by Moody\u201fs and \n                                                \n7  Arminfo Independent News Agency.  2011 Analysis (Ranking) of the banking sector of Armenia.

Ameria  is  a  full-service  commercial  and  investment  bank  owned  by  TDA \nHoldings since 2007 (99.9%), which in turn is 95% owned by Ruben Vardanian, founder of \nTroika Dialog Group, a top investment bank in the Russian Federation. Ameria is the leading \nbank in renewable energy and has the largest hydropower portfolio in Armenia. Ameria benefits \nfrom an energetic, progressive, and professional management team that has been able to \nrapidly transform the bank into one of the country\u201fs top financial institutions. Ameria had higher \nlevels of capital and liquidity during the crisis than other banks, enabling it to draw select \ncorporate clients away from top banks. In 2010 Ameria adopted a new strategy, seeking to \ncapitalize on its reputation to expand its SME and retail operations; the latter will provide Ameria \nwith greater access to retail deposits. Ameria aims to reduce its large-borrower concentration by \nexpanding its lending focus to SMEs and their employees, and increasing its SME lending from \n21% to about one-third of its portfolio by 2013. Ameria plans to expand its currently small \nbranch network both organically and through further acquisitions. Ameria is not yet rated, but \nplans to obtain a rating by 2014. \n \n12.  ASHIB.  ASHIB  is  a  full-service  financial  institution  offering  corporate,  SME,  and \nconsumer loans. ASHIB\u201fs primary beneficial shareholder is Karen Safaryan (83% ownership), a \nRussian citizen of Armenian origin who holds interests in mining and food across Armenia and \nthe Russian Federation. In December 2007, the IFC acquired a 10% stake in ASHIB. During the \ncrisis ASHIB adopted more restrictive lending policies and its market position in terms of assets \nweakened from second in 2008 to fifth in 2010. ASHIB recently completed a comprehensive \nbottom-up analysis of its business to understand the profitability dynamics of its products and \nmarket segments. As a result ASHIB restructured its organization and has started to classify \nclients and differentiate its strategy between market segments. ASHIB is also launching a cards \nprocessing center through which it plans to offer its customers a full suite of products and \nservices, including payment services, which will help increase dram deposits. Moody\u201fs rates \nASHIB\u201fs long-term global local currency deposit rating at Ba2 (stable).  \n \n13.  Ineco. Ineco is 37% owned by Avetis Baloyan, who is also the bank\u201fs chief executive \nofficer, and 33% owned by Karen Safaryan, the primary owner of ASHIB. IFC owns 10% and \nDeutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellshaft owns 13.5%. SME financing has long been \na strategic business line for Ineco; more than half of its loans have historically been devoted to \nSMEs, with the balance in retail and microlending.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n19.  The program will provide US dollar-denominated senior unsecured loans totaling up to \n$65 million to ACBA, ASHIB, Ameria, and Ineco. Ineco\u201fs loan will be extended upon approval of \nthe Investment Committee of material terms and conditions based on updated due diligence and \npricing closer to the target date of funding. The loans to the PFIs will be offered in parallel with \ncapacity development TA to enhance the banks\u201f SME lending capabilities and for product \ndevelopment.8 The funding needs for each PFI\u201fs SME loan portfolio over the loan availability \nperiod was carefully assessed and compared with recently signed and anticipated facilities from \nother IFIs to estimate the funding gap.  \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions (Phase 2). Manila (TA 7707-REG). ", "5   \n \n20.  Program parameters. The loan agreements with the PFIs must be signed within 2 \nyears of Board approval. The loan agreements have common criteria for onlending, including (i) \na common SME definition that is suited to the market and conforms to the government\u201fs SME \ndefinition; (ii) subloan amount limits; and (iii) targets aimed at increasing SME subloans outside \nYerevan,  where  the  poverty  rate  is  higher.  Borrowers  will  have  the  option  to  convert  the \ncurrency of repayment from US dollars to dram, if and when ADB is able to execute a currency \nconversion on agreeable terms and conditions. The TA offered to PFIs will be tailored to each \nbank\u201fs needs, will complement TA provided by other IFIs or government agencies, and focus on \nbuilding bank capacity to lend to SMEs (footnote 11).  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The program-based approach results in more uniform intervention by ADB in SMEs and \nefficiencies in implementation (i.e., in legal documentation and expenses), TA processing, and \nongoing monitoring. For monitoring, the proposed terms of the loan agreement will require the \nbanks to provide the following information: (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly \nbasis;  (ii)  audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis;  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for \nagreed-upon financial covenants on a quarterly basis; and (iv) reports on the subloans on a \nsemiannual basis. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB on a regular basis \n(at least annually) based on the Operations Manual section on nonsovereign operations.9 The \nfirst monitoring report will be submitted no later than 12 months after Board approval. \n \n22.  Many  SMEs  in  Armenia  import  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  from  or  are \nengaged  in  trade  with  both  members  and  nonmembers  of  ADB  (including  the  Russian \nFederation), and a request for Board approval is therefore being made, pursuant to the ADB \nCharter,  to  approve  procurement  from  nonmembers  in  appropriate  circumstances.10 Board \napproval on this issue is being requested with respect to procurement by SME sub borrowers \nusing loan proceeds under the program. This request reflects the market-based nature of the \ninvestment program, trade agreements, and SME demand and procurement history. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  The program will provide critically needed funding to SMEs. The program will support the \nbanking system by providing funding to banks whose ability to raise funds is constrained by \nArmenia\u201fs underdeveloped finance sector and further limited by the financial crisis. The program \ndifferentiates itself from other DFI assistance in several ways: (i) it is the first SME loan known \nto  incorporate  the  government\u201fs  definition  of  SME,  assuring  that  the  types  of  enterprises \ntargeted by public policy makers are served; (ii) it requires banks to devote a minimum share of \nproceeds to SME loans outside Yerevan, where the poverty rate is higher; and (iii) it sets the \ngroundwork for the first known effort to collect sex-disaggregated data from banks to understand \ntheir lending practices toward SMEs owned by women. Through the TA, the program will also \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2010. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10. Manila. \n10 ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila (Article 14[ix]) provides: \u201cThe proceeds \nof any loan, investment or other financing undertaken in the ordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds \nestablished by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1(i) of Article 19, shall be used only for procurement of goods and \nservices produced in member countries, except in any case in which the Board of Directors, by a vote of Directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in \na non-member country or of goods and services produced in a non-member country in special circumstances \nmaking such procurement appropriate, as in the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of \nfinancing has been provided  to the Bank.\u201d \n ", "6 \n \nsupport the development of the banking sector by enhancing the capacity of banks to expand \nservices to SMEs and serve them more sustainably (footnote 11).  \n \nD.  Risks \n24.  Asset quality.  Several years of rapid asset expansion in the banking sector and further \nextension of credit could pose challenges to portfolio and asset quality. However, due diligence \nhas ascertained that the PFIs identified have appropriate risk management processes in place \nand  are  taking  steps  to  improve  their  risk  underwriting  and  portfolio  monitoring  capability. \nAdditionally, the TA is expected to help the banks strengthen their SME lending practices \n(footnote 11).   \n \n25.  Foreign exchange risk.   ADB\u201fs investment will be denominated in US dollars and, as \nsuch, there is foreign exchange risk.  If there are currency fluctuations, performance of the PFIs \nmay be impacted.  However, this is partly mitigated by (i) the PFIs\u201f large foreign currency \ndeposits); (ii) the additional DFI funding being made available in local currency; and (iii) CBA \nguidelines that mandate limited open foreign exchange positions. Also, the facilities may be \nconverted to local currencies if ADB is able to offer such an option.  SMEs that borrow from \nPFIs in US dollars and do not earn US dollar revenues could encounter similar risks. This risk is \nmitigated to some extent by the PFIs\u201f credit assessment processes and collateral requirements \nof SME subborrowers, which take currency mismatch risk into consideration. Since the crisis, \nthe  NPL  ratios  of  the  PFIs\u201f  SME  portfolios  have  not  differed  from  that  of  their  total  loan \nportfolios, despite being heavily weighted by US dollar loans. Moreover, many SMEs benefit \nfrom  remittance  inflows  in  foreign  currency,  as  over  a  third  of  Armenian  families  receive \nremittances from abroad. Since most consumption in Armenia is import-driven and the economy \nis highly dollarized, businesses often and are able to adjust their prices to exchange rate \nfluctuations. Finally, the CBA is taking steps to stabilize exchange rates.11  It is important to note \nthat ADB\u201fs loan will be repaid by the banks from the entirety of their operations, and not \nexclusively from their SME businesses. \n \n26.  Refinancing  risk  and  program  sustainability. Armenia\u201fs banks are very small by \ninternational  standards  and  the  local  capital  markets  are  undeveloped.  This  limits  funding \nsources for banks, which must depend on deposits and DFI support. Once ADB\u201fs facility expires \nthere is a risk that PFIs will face challenges in obtaining additional financing. However, all PFIs \nhave taken steps to increase their deposit base, and have high levels of US dollar deposits. \nThey also enjoy support from strong shareholders and other DFIs. The TA is also an important \ncomponent in enhancing the PFIs\u201f SME lending capabilities, which will ensure the program has \na long-lasting impact that extends beyond the deployment of ADB funding (footnote 11).  \n \n27.  Slow economic recovery. Armenia\u201fs recovery from the economic crisis is expected to \nbe slow in the medium term. GDP is predicted to expand by 4.0% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012.12 \nSlow economic growth could reduce PFI lending and profitability, and put strains on the SMEs.  \n \n \n                                                \n11 IMF. 2011. Armenia: Program Note. http://www.imf.org/external/np/country/notes/pdf/armenia.pdf  (29 June). \n12  ADB. 2011. Asian Development Outlook 2011. Manila (Armenia country chapter). ", "7   \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n29.  The impact will be increased SME contribution to the economy to promote broad-based \ngrowth. Supporting SME activity can help raise SMEs\u201f contribution to employment, and hence to \nindividual incomes, particularly outside Yerevan. SME activity enhances entrepreneurship and \ninnovation,  which  will  help  Armenia  increase  its  competitiveness.  SMEs  can  help  diversify \nArmenia\u201fs economy beyond areas such as metals and mining and break down oligopolies. The \noutcome will be access by banks to medium-term funding, which will also result in an improved \nasset\u2013liability profile for the PFIs.  This will enable PFIs to extend medium-term funding to \nSMEs. The outputs will be providing banks with additional funds for onlending to SMEs. The \nfunding provided to banks under the program will allow them to reach more SMEs and offer their \nSME customers more financial products and services. Enabling banks to provide SMEs with \nlonger-term capital will allow SMEs to invest in technology and equipment to increase their \ngrowth and productivity. The TA will increase the capacity of banks to onlend the funds more \nefficiently and with greater probability of repayment (footnote 11). \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n30.  Strategy 2020 identifies private sector development and private sector operations as one \nof the five drivers of change to mobilize resources to help alleviate poverty in the region.  \nFinancial  sector  development  is  noted  as  one  of the five  core specializations  that  will  be \nundertaken in support of this agenda.13 The SME Finance Program supports private sector \ndevelopment through financial sector development by increasing the capacity and ability of \nArmenian banks to expand lending to urban and non-urban SMEs, which comprise an important \nand underserved portion of Armenia\u201fs economy. The documents that detail the government\u201fs \nbroad macroeconomic objectives repeatedly emphasize private sector operations as essential \nto Armenia\u201fs growth.14 ADB\u201fs Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy, 2006\u20132009 \nfor Armenia cites that an underdeveloped finance sector, including lack of access to long-term \nfinancing, is a major bottleneck to private sector development.15 The interim strategy directs \nADB to build capacity in the finance sector through direct intervention in banking to improve \nstandards, governance, and liquidity in the market. The program meets the government\u201fs and \nADB\u201fs country strategy by providing Armenia\u201fs banks with medium-term debt financing and \ncapacity building to increase support for SMEs, which are an important segment of the private \nsector, and will aid its overall development.  \n  \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n31.  Armenia is at an early stage of finance sector development. Under the PSCM Business \nPlan and Priorities, 2010\u2013201216, ADB will assist stronger private banks with loans, equity, and \nTA to encourage and support market participants at the forefront. ADB intervention in such \nsituations will likely involve a long process, involving repeat and follow-on loans from ADB or \nother DFI programs. The Financial Sector Operational Plan calls for enhanced focus on the \n                                                \n13\n ADB. 2008.

This program will help to address \nthe prior gaps of capacity building through the provision of the TA. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary   \n32.  The program is classified under category FI for impacts on environment and involuntary \nresettlement, and category FI (treated as C) with respect to indigenous peoples. An assessment \nhas been made of (i) the program's potential environment and social safeguards impacts; (ii) the \nrisks associated with the PFls' existing and likely future portfolio; and (iii) the PFIs\u201f commitment, \nsystems, and capacity for managing environmental and social safeguards impacts. For each \nPFI, existing environmental and social management systems (ESMSs) have been reviewed and \nareas where improvements are needed have been identified; effective measures to address \nthem are laid out in the linked document describing ESMS arrangements. The PFls will ensure \nthat an ESMS satisfactory to ADB and compliant with ADB\u201fs Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nis in place prior to first disbursement and that subloans comply with the agreed ESMS and \napplicable  national  laws  and regulations.  PFIs will  also  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment \nactivities list, and submit annual reports on ESMS implementation. \n \n33.  A gender action plan has been prepared and PFls are encouraged to track and report \nonlending  to  businesses  owned  or  led  by  women.  PFls  adopting  the  plan  will  receive \nimplementation assistance from ADB. Armenia has ratified all conventions with respect to core \nlabor  standards.  ASHIB  and  Ameria  have  adopted  standards  covering  labor  and  working \nconditions of their own staff and clients\u201f employees. All PFl annual reports will need to include \ninformation on compliance with core labor standards by PFI subborrowers using ADB funds. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n34.  Due diligence on each PFI\u201fs anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer procedures \nwas performed and verified to meet all requirements of the CBA. The PFIs were advised of \nADB\u201fs Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and its policy of implementing best \ninternational  practice  relating  to  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate \nanticorruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations and Assurances \n \n35.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single \ninvestment  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign  investments.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement \nEstablishing the Asian Development Bank,18 the Government of Armenia will be requested to \nconfirm that it has no objection to the proposed program. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of this proposal by \nthe Board of Directors. \n \n                                                \n17 ADB Financial Sector Development Community of Practice. 2011.
