INTRODUCTION \n1.   The Government of Thailand requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to help \nimprove the performance of its railways so that they could take a more substantial role in the \ncountry\u2019s transport system. The development of modern and efficient railways will help reduce \nthe  country\u2019s  transport  bottlenecks,  improve  overall  integration  and  safety  of  the  transport \nsystem, and reduce negative environmental impacts, such as climate change.  \n \n2.  Connectivity between Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries is a key priority of \nADB operations in the region. One of the most effective means of improving connectivity is by \nimproving land transport links along major GMS corridors. Thailand\u2014located at the geographic \ncenter of the GMS\u2014will necessarily act as the hub of a GMS railway network, and as the \ngateway to Malaysia and Singapore. \n \n3.  The capacity development technical assistance (TA) was first identified and agreed with \nthe government when preparing the Thailand country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014. It \nwas then confirmed and expanded through regular site visits and meetings with the government \nand State Railway of Thailand (SRT) carried out jointly by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Transport and \nCommunications Division and Thailand Resident Mission. The draft TA paper was submitted to \nthe  government\u2019s  Public  Debt  Management  Office  early  in  July  2012.  ADB  conducted \nconsultations  with  senior  government  representatives  (Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  Ministry  of \nFinance,  Ministry  of  Transport,  and  SRT).  The  government  expressed  its  support  and \nappreciation of ADB\u2019s proposed interventions, and supported the TA impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The SRT-operated network is 4,130 kilometers (km) long; 3,880 km are single track. The \nnetwork consists primarily of four main lines that radiate outward from Bangkok (located in the \ncentral region), and serves the four outlying regions of the country: northern line (975 km), \nnortheastern line (1,143 km), eastern line (621 km), and southern line (1,625 km). The SRT \nnetwork serves 42 of the country\u2019s 76 provinces, and has the potential to provide a strong \nfoundation for passenger transport in Thailand, and to connect with neighboring Southeast \nAsian countries. The current SRT-operated infrastructure is outdated, poorly maintained, and \ndoes  not  meet  market  expectations.  Currently,  SRT  operations  have  high  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, and low fares and charges; the service is poor. From 2007 to 2009, SRT \nhad 171 rail accidents, and averaged 107 derailments per year. \n \n5.  Thailand\u2019s Eleventh National Plan emphasizes the need for expanding infrastructure and \ntransport systems to improve connectivity between Bangkok and the country\u2019s provinces and \nneighboring  countries.  The  cabinet  approved  an  investment  program  requiring  $6  billion \nequivalent in financing to launch a modernization program for the existing railway network, \nwhich is owned and operated by SRT.  \n \n6.  The  current  SRT  operation  is  mixed  freight  service  and  passenger  service.  The \ngovernment is concentrating on the rehabilitation and upgrading of tracks, and procurement of \nlocomotives and rolling stock. The core justification of these investments is to reduce Thailand\u2019s \nhigh logistics costs in order for Thailand to remain competitive within the region.  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 September 2012. \n ", "2 \n7.  One  of  the  key  strategic  issues  for  future  SRT  operation  is  the  role  of  passenger \ntransport in Thailand, with regard to (i) freight transport operations, and track and equipment \naccess; (ii) the public service obligation, and (iii) integration with other modes of transport.  \n \n8.  Historically, and as presently managed and operated, the railway passenger service is a \nkey product that SRT provides to the public. Often it is the only transport mode that is affordable \nto the poor (passenger services are provided to the poor through the public service obligation at \nminimal cost and with low quality service).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The  TA  will  directly  support  social  inclusiveness  by  developing  railway  passenger \nservices that are primarily used by the poor. The TA will assist the government in preparing a \nstrategic (planning) framework for the development of SRT passenger services. In general the \nscope of work will be divided into three main components: (i) review existing SRT passenger \ndemand forecasts and identify new commercial passenger service opportunities; (ii) prepare a \ndraft SRT passenger station management and operations manual; and (iii) prepare a road map, \nimplementation plan, and strategy framework for upgrading SRT passenger service.  \n \n10.  The TA is part of ongoing and planned assistance provided by ADB to Thailand\u2019s rail \nsubsector,  which  focuses  on  (i)  preparing  a  restructuring  plan  and  reform  agenda, 2  \n(ii) improving SRT\u2019s financial and accounting systems,3 and (iii) planning for the GMS railway \nassociation.4  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the railway system is consistent with Strategy 2020, which targets \nclimate change mitigation, as well as ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan, \nwhich focuses on rail transport. ADB\u2019s involvement in rail transport is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nTransport Sector Assessment Strategy and Road Map for Thailand. ADB will provide support to \nbuilding  a  sustainable  transport  system  in  Thailand  by  modernizing  railways.  The  TA  is \nconsistent  with  ADB's  current  country  partnership  strategy,  2007\u20132011  for  Thailand;  its \nstrategies include environmental protection and increased global competitiveness. It identifies \ninfrastructure development as a core strategic area of partnership. The TA is included in the \nThailand country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be the establishment of a modern SRT passenger service by unbundling \nSRT business operations through implementation of a new passenger service strategy and \nguidelines.  The  outcome  will  be  the  adoption  of  a  new  passenger  service  strategy  and \nguidelines. \n \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2012.

Technical Assistance for Planning the Greater Mekong Subregion Railway Coordination Office. Manila \n(small-scale TA 7678-REG). \n ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Three  outputs  are  envisaged  for  the  TA:  (i)  a  review  of  SRT  passenger  demand \nforecasts and identification of new commercial passenger service opportunities, (ii) a draft SRT \npassenger  station  management  and  operations  manual,  and  (iii)  a  road  map  and \nimplementation plan and strategy framework for upgrading SRT passenger service. The key \nactivities will be (i) collect and review data and planning methodology, and prepare a new \nforecast methodology; (ii) undertake railway station reconnaissance missions, benchmark with \nbest international practices, and formulate recommendations for improvement; (iii) prepare a \nrailway passenger strategy for SRT to determine if passenger services within the SRT network \nhave a viable future, and prepare an analysis of the type and most effective use of public\u2013\nprivate partnerships to finance some of the (station) upgrades and development.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of France,5 and administered by ADB.  The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  be  the  executing  agency;  and  the  SRT  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The SRT will appoint a project director for the TA. The consultants will be \nbased in SRT headquarters and Hua Lamphong station to ensure in-house training of SRT staff.  \n \n16.  Consulting services will be required: about 8 person-months of international consultants \nand  11  person-months  of  national  consultants.  An  international  consulting  firm,  or  an \ninternational firm in association with a national consultant will be recruited to execute the TA. \nThe  key  areas  of  expertise  are  (i)  transport  planning,  (ii)  railway  safety  and  operations, \n(iii) railway and transport marketing, and (iv) public-private partnerships. The TA consultant will \nbe selected using the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the \nTA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  ADB  undertook  regular  consultations  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of \nTransport,  the  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board,  SRT,  and  the  Thailand \nDevelopment Research Institute during prereconnaissance, reconnaissance, and programming \nmissions.  \n \n18.  The TA  review  missions  will  monitor the TA findings  and  outputs,  and  provide  the \nevaluation in a TA completion report. The TA findings and outputs will be disseminated via \nexisting ADB external relations communication channels. The TA will be implemented from \nJanuary 2013 to June 2013.  \n \n                                                \n5 Financed through the Channel Financing Agreement (Technical Assistance Program) between the Government of \nFrance and the Asian Development Bank. \n ", "4 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Thailand to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of France for the Improvement of \nRailway Passenger Services, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
