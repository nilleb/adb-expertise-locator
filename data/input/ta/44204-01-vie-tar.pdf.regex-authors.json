INTRODUCTION \n1.  Dialogue between the Government of Viet Nam and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas highlighted the importance of providing timely support to the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment (MPI) on the preparation and implementation of the Socioeconomic Development \nPlan (SEDP), 2011\u20132015. An ADB fact-finding mission met with MPI officials in November 2010 \nto prepare the technical assistance (TA) and reached an understanding with the government on \nits impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In 2009, the government began preparing the SEDP, 2011\u20132015, which is scheduled to \nbe approved by the National Assembly in November 2011. The government has committed to \nstrengthening the results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for the new SEDP. \nThe government decision resulted from the work of an earlier ADB TA, Support for Results-\nbased Monitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth, which identified significant challenges in \nresults-based  poverty  monitoring  and  assessment.2 Although  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment indicators are used in Viet Nam, they are often used inconsistently, as evidenced \nby the mixed use of a variety of outcome and output indicators in the results framework. This \nearlier TA helped the government develop aggregate, sector, and local results indicators, as \nwell as thematic indicators. These indicators formed part of the SEDP M&E framework that was \nissued by MPI on 30 May 2007 (Decision No. 555).3 The M&E results framework was developed \nin a participatory manner, through a series of national and provincial training seminars, and in \nconsultation with experts, practitioners, managers, and development partners, especially the \nWorld Bank. Government officials were also trained on the concept and application of managing \nfor development results (MfDR). The indicators that were developed were subsequently used for \nthe midterm review of the SEDP, 2006\u20132010. \n \n3.  The completion report for Support for Results-based Monitoring of Poverty Reduction \nand  Growth  assessed  the  outcomes  of  the  TA  as  highly  satisfactory.  The  TA  contributed \npositively to ADB\u2019s support for a broader MfDR agenda for public sector management (PSM) in \nViet Nam. Results-based approaches in development planning and establishing indicators have \nbeen introduced. However, the lessons learned from the TA indicate that more needs to be \ndone to ensure the implementation of Decision 555 to enable SEDP, 2011\u20132015 to use the \nM&E  framework  effectively.  The  framework  needs  to  support  the  planning,  budgeting, \nimplementation, and evaluation dimensions of PSM. A robust PSM system will enable the \ngovernment to make informed choices on resource allocation and will improve expenditure \nefficiency for more effective development.  \n \n4.  SEDP, 2006\u201320104 identified opportunities to improve the SEDP planning approach, the \nstructures and institutions, the M&E framework, including the use of appropriate indicators, as \nwell as the use of information for crucial policy and program decision making. The opportunities \ninclude (i) promoting a better understanding of the benefits of results-based approaches in PSM, \n(ii) developing time-bound and measurable indicators, (iii) establishing baselines, (iv) collecting \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 November 2010.  \n2  ADB. 2005.

Experience from implementing the \nSEDP, 2006\u20132010 also identified the need to link the development plan  to the budget and \nexpenditures. The M&E framework of the development plan is directly linked, and contributes to, \nimproved fiscal and financial management as it supports efficient budget allocations.  \n \n5.  An important lesson learned during the SEDP, 2006\u20132010 period was the need to \ndesign and bring into operation the institutions and functions to implement Decision 555. The \nexperience also showed that the M&E system is crucial to supporting decision making on \npolicies, strategies, and budget allocations. \n \n6.  Significant work needs to be done under the SEDP, 2011\u20132015 to improve the M&E \nsystem  and  the  institutions  and  operations  needed  to  ensure  development  effectiveness. \nStrategic links with the budgetary process need to be put in place. Failure to address these \nissues may prevent the SEDP, 2011\u20132015 from delivering results. Viet Nam is an emerging \neconomy and after steadily achieving good progress in reducing poverty over the last 20 years, \nit is well placed to incorporate results-based approaches into its PSM. A stronger M&E system \nis crucial to achieving this. The proposed TA will strengthen the existing M&E system, its \ninstitutions and functions, in addition to providing support for human resources development. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be improved implementation of the SEDP. The outcome will be \na  better  M&E  system  for  the  SEDP,  with  reliable  and  timely  performance  monitoring  and \nreporting.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will involve a number of strategies and activities in successfully implementing the \nSEDP M&E system. The general strategy for the TA is to support and strengthen the existing \nsystem, begun under SEDP, 2006\u20132010. A number of operational strategies and actions will be \nused to strengthen the system and therefore SEDP, 2011\u20132015. The strategies are as follows: \n \n(i)  strengthening the understanding and appreciation of the dynamics of M&E and \nhow it can be used strategically to strengthen SEDP planning, implementation, \nand results management; \n(ii)  reviewing and strengthening the design and conceptual validity and reliability of \nthe existing SEDP M&E framework, including checking the existing indicators to \nensure they are consistent with international good practices, and that data can be \ncollected to monitor performance against them;  \n(iii)  designing a robust and sustainable M&E implementation plan and accompanying \nmechanisms, tools, and techniques at policy and operational levels; \n(iv)  carrying out a participatory M&E development and prioritization exercise to obtain \ncommitment from all key stakeholders; \n(v)  developing  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  for  operational  guidance  and \ncapacity building; \n(vi)  carrying out structured and systematic technical and managerial capacity building \nfor key institutions and stakeholders; \n(vii)   strengthening the sustainability of the M&E system through a training of trainers \nprogram  with  representation  from  key  institutions,  and  forging  strategic \n ", "  3 \npartnerships with training institutions, universities, and other service providers \nusing a multifaceted capacity building strategy; \n(viii)  designing and building long-term initiatives that will be the foundation for broad-\nbased knowledge, appreciation, and use of M&E for development management; \n(ix)  identifying and setting up key institutional mechanisms at policy and operational \nlevels; \n(x)  improving  operational  effectiveness  and  efficiency  at  policy  and  operational \nlevels; \n(xi)  reviewing and strengthening the M&E system\u2019s links with the SEDP, in particular \nthe strategic links between development planning and budgeting, as well as how \nM&E supports both these functions; and \n(xii)  designing and initiating a structured program of change management at policy \nand operational levels to ensure that the transition to a full-fledged results-based \nSEDP and its M&E system can be achieved within specified timelines. \n \n9.  These strategies are based on the experience of implementing the SEDP M&E system \nas well as from international good practices. The main outcome of the strategies will be better \nresults planning at both policy and operational levels. This includes a more concise national \nM&E  framework,  which  can  also  be  used  by  ministries  and  provinces.  Improved  use  of \nperformance indicators at operational levels will lead to better results monitoring and reporting, \nwhich in turn will produce more timely and reliable results information for all SEDP development \nprograms and projects. \n \n10.  The project will deliver three outputs: (i) a results-based M&E framework for SEDP, \n2011\u20132015,  (ii)  strengthened  institutional  and  functional  set  up;  and  technical  capacity  for \nrelevant government officials; and (iii) a computerized M&E system.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Results-based M&E framework for SEDP 2011\u20132015. It is crucial that the \nSEDP,  2011\u20132015  be  supported  by  an  effective  and  practical  M&E  system  covering  all \nprograms and projects for the 5-year duration. This M&E system should be supported by a well \ndefined, logically structured, and integrated M&E framework. The results-based framework will \nguide and ensure that the M&E system is able to support timely and reliable performance \nmeasurement and reporting by implementing agencies. The M&E framework will be designed \nand developed during the first year of the TA and is expected to be approved and operational by \nJune 2013, at least in the MPI and in three other ministries. Output 1 will serve as the basis for \noutput 2. \n \n12.  Output 2: Strengthened institutional and functional set up; and technical capacity \nfor  relevant  government  officials.  An  M&E  framework  can  only  be  effective  if  it  is \nsystematically linked to appropriate institutional and functional setups and the budgetary system. \nThe TA will help to establish these links and to improve program and project officials\u2019 M&E \nknowledge and skills. \n \n13.  Under the TA, about 400 key officials from policy-level entities and operational ministries \nand provinces will be trained in M&E and program and project management. The training of \ntrainers  approach  will  be  used to  ensure  the capacity  building  in  M&E  is  sustained  in  all \nagencies. Appropriate technical guidelines and user manuals will be produced for the trainers \nand the agency officials. The first will be used for the training of trainers program. The second \nwill be a users' manual on the M&E system to guide agencies in carrying out the M&E system \nunder the SEDP. \n \n ", "4   \n14.  Output 3: A computerized M&E system in selected agencies. The TA will provide \ntechnical support to computerize the revised SEDP M&E system. The TA will produce a cost-\neffective computerized integrated solution to help ensure that the SEDP M&E system can \ncapture  performance  data  at  each  implementation  level.  Consultations  with  stakeholders, \nincluding development partners, will be conducted to avoid potential system conflicts.  \n \n15.  On the overall implementation of the proposed results-based integrated M&E system for \nthe SEDP, it is proposed to adopt a comprehensive approach to government coverage. The \nintegrated M&E system for the SEDP 2011\u20132015 will cover all ministries and provinces. This is \nappropriate as the same approach will be used for the SEDP, 2011\u20132015. To ensure effective \nand sustainable application of the system, implementation will phased. In the first year, the TA \nwill focus on preparing the national SEDP framework and its implementation manual. In the \nsecond year, work will focus mainly on MPI and the most active ministries, while providing \ntraining for all agencies. During the third year, the TA will carry out further strengthening for the \nremaining ministries and provinces. The full implementation of the framework will be done in \nstages, with the initial phase focusing on improving the results framework and indicator sets, \nand trial performance monitoring and reporting. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,625,000 equivalent, of which $1,300,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will \nfinance the remaining cost of $325,000 through in-kind contributions, which will cover office and \nsupport  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  support,  and  local  transportation  for \ncounterpart staff. The cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MPI will be the executing agency and it will assign a vice minister to provide overall \nguidance to the TA. The vice minister will also chair the inception, midterm review, and final \nworkshops.  The  Department  for  National  Economic  Issues  (DNEI)  under  MPI  will  be  the \nimplementing agency and will directly supervise and implement the daily activities of the TA. \nMPI will provide office and counterpart staff to the TA; establish a project management unit \ncomprising representatives from DNEI, the Foreign Economic Relations Department of MPI, and \nthe General Statistics Office; and assign a project director from DNEI to oversee the project. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from January 2011 to December 2013. A \ntotal of 82 (20 international and 62 domestic) person-months of consulting services will be \nrequired. ADB will recruit an international M&E advisor, who will serve as the project team \nleader.  The  team  leader  will  be  supported  by  a  national  M&E  consultant,  an  information \ntechnology expert, and a project coordinator. The team leader will be recruited as an individual \nconsultant. A firm will be engaged for three domestic consultant positions. This firm will be also \nin charge of procuring equipment, carrying out surveys, and training staff. Consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). TA-financed equipment will be transferred to the executing agency \nat the conclusion of the TA. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \nDisbursement under the TA project will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  Regular  quarterly  progress  reports  will  be  produced  by  the  project.  These  will  be \ndiscussed by the project team and stakeholders, who will meet on a quarterly basis. Remedial \n ", "  5 \nactions, where needed, will be carried out by the project team based on feedback from the \nmeeting. A tripartite meeting between the government, ADB and the consultants, chaired by the \ndirector general of DNEI, will be held every 6 months to review the progress of the project \nimplementation and agree on the plan for the upcoming 6 months. \n \n20.  Key information on the project and its progress will be uploaded to a dedicated project \nwebsite. The website will contain information on the outputs and outcome of the project and \nproject evaluation results. The website will offer dynamic participation opportunities for those \ninvolved in similar projects within Viet Nam and in other countries. The website will also be used \nto support all ministries and provinces implementing the M&E system through discussion forums. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Support for the Preparation and Implementation of the Results-\nBased Socioeconomic Development Plan 2011\u20132015 and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \n  Indicators with  Reporting  Risks  \nBaselinesa  Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved   Performance against   Annual plan  Government fully \nPerformance of  the  80%\u201390% of SEDP  performance report  implements and follows \nSEDP   outcomes has improved     through with the \n  by 2015 (outcome  Outcome performance  results-based \n  achievement rate)  reports using SEDP  development planning \n  M&E system  and M&E system \n     \n  Assessment of delivery  Sustained program of \n  of SEDP outcomes  capacity building is \n  (through the M&E  carried out \n  system)   \n     \n  Usage report from M&E \n  system \n   \nPerformance information \nbeing used by MPI and \n30% of ministries and \nprovinces for evidence-\nbased policy, program, \nand budgetary decision-\nmaking by 2015 \nOutcome      Risk \n       \nImproved M&E  Results-based M&E  Assessment reports by  Conflict between \nsystem with reliable  system used by MPI and  MPI  systems being \nand timely  three government    developed by different \nperformance  ministries for the SEDP,  Performance record for  agencies \nmonitoring and  2011\u20132015 by June 2013  each outcome area   \nreporting support for    through the M&E \nthe SEDP, 2011\u2013 Use of standardized and  system maintained by \n2015  uniform data collection and  MPI \n  dissemination mechanisms   \n  by 50% of government  Assessment report of \n  ministries by June 2013  information usage for \n  program and policy \n  decisions prepared by \nMPI \n \nOutputs       Risk \n       \nResults-based  Approved results  MPI official records   Frequent changes in \nM&E framework  framework used by MPI    staff engaged in M&E \nestablished for  and three government  Usage reports by  activities \nSEDP, 2011\u2013  ministries by June 2013  ministries   \n2015       \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \n  Indicators with  Reporting  Risks  \nBaselinesa  Mechanisms    \n \nInstitutional,  Institutional and functional  Completion reports \n \nfunctional, and  mechanisms established  from ministries \n \ntechnical capacity  and operational in MPI and   \n \nstrengthened    three ministries by June  Training assessment \n \n  2013  reports prepared by \n \n    consultants \n \n  Improved knowledge and   \n \n  skills of 400 government   \n \n  officials (at least 40% of   \n \n  whom are women) by June   \n \n  2013, on results-based   \n \n  management and M&E   \n \n  (indicators: test results on   \n \n  skills and knowledge   \n \n  before and after training)   \n \n     \nA computerized  Computerized M&E  Implementation and  Potential incompatibility \nM&E system is  system is operational at  progress reports from  of computerized M&E \noperational in  MPI, and at least one  MPI and relevant  system with existing \nselected agencies  sector and one province by  agencies  databases \nJune 2013       \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1 Review current SEDP planning system and  ADB: $1,300,000 \nframework and the M&E system (month 1). \nItem  Amount ($\u2019000) \n1.2 Conduct consultative meetings on proposed \n20 person-months of  705.00 \nrevision of the M&E system and framework \ninternational consultants and \nwith key stakeholders (months 2\u20134). \n62 person-months of \n1.3 Conduct initial baseline survey on selected  domestic consultants \nM&E indicators (months 5\u20136). \nTraining expenses  360.00 \n1.4 Conduct survey on selected M&E indicators \nReport, communication and  30.00 \nand data for 2012 (months 28\u201330). \ntranslation \n \nEquipments  50.00 \n2.1 Assess capacity building needs (months 5\u20136). \nSurvey  50.00 \n2.2 Review the government\u2019s SEDP M&E \nMiscellaneous administration  30.00 \ninstitutional arrangement (months 5\u20136) \nsupport costs \n2.3 Identify training courses and prepare and pre-\nContingencies  75.00 \ntest training materials (month 6). \n   \n2.4 Train national and provincial staff (months 7\u2013\n9).   \n2.5 Validate training program and outcomes and \nGovernment $325,000 \nfinalize training courses and materials (month \n10).

The proposed strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the \nforthcoming  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP),  2011\u20132015  will  provide  important \nsupport  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  governance.  It  will  review  and  strengthen  the \ndevelopment planning system and frameworks to make the M&E system more effective and \nefficient. This review is fundamental to improving the performance of the country\u2019s SEDP over \nthe next 5 years. \n \n2.  The overall aim of the review and adjustments to the development planning approach, \nstructure, and system as a whole is to promote the successful implementation of the SEDP. \nThis will only be possible if there is a sound M&E system that sets clear and realistic indicators \nand measurements that can be addressed.  \n \n3.  Several steps need to be performed before the revised system and tools can be fully \nfunctional. The actions should be carried out gradually to ensure efficient adoption of the revised \nM&E system, leading to improved implementation of the SEDP, 2011\u20132015. \n \n4.  The project team will comprise an international M&E advisor and team leader, supported \nby three national consultants (M&E expert, project coordinator, and information technology \nexpert), as well as clerical support.
