INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen action-oriented \ndisaster risk management knowledge for disaster-resilient infrastructure in developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  through  (i)  developing  upstream \ndisaster-resilient infrastructure know-how; (ii) reviewing existing infrastructure investment design \nprocesses at the preparatory phase in selected DMCs; and (iii)  building the capacity of selected \nDMCs to incorporate disaster-resilient measures in post-disaster reconstruction processes and \ndocumenting the measures for the benefit of all DMCs.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2019 and 2020 management-approved results-based work plan \nof the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).2 It supports the \nimplementation of (i) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 on tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability and (ii) ADB\u2019s Operational Plan \nfor Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020.3 The TA responds to individual country \npartnership strategies to enhance disaster resilience. The TA will help DMCs attain disaster \nresilience ambitions under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Sendai Framework \nfor Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030, and the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards  threaten  the  long-term  sustainability  of \ndevelopment in Asia and the Pacific. DMCs face significant disaster and climate risk. Between \n2008 and 2017 alone, extreme weather events and geophysical hazards caused direct physical \nlosses averaging $46 billion per year\u2014or $134 million per day. Losses included damage to \ninfrastructure, homes, and businesses, with indirect economic and social consequences for jobs, \nproductivity, and the provision of services. The failure of insufficiently resilient infrastructure also \ncontributed to more than 317,000 disaster-related fatalities over the same period.5 \n \n4.  Escalating disaster losses emphasize the urgent need for DMCs to adequately address \ndisaster risk in planning and designing infrastructure. This issue is particularly urgent because of \nthe region\u2019s huge infrastructure investment needs over the next 20 years, combined with climate \nchange\u2019s expected adverse impacts on the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. \nDeveloping Asia will need to invest $26 trillion in infrastructure between 2016 and 2030, or $1.7 \ntrillion per year, to maintain its growth momentum, eradicate poverty, and respond to climate \nchange.6 \n \n5.  The barriers to sustainable and resilient infrastructure go beyond finance. Challenges \ninclude how and where infrastructure is built, the appropriateness and application of infrastructure \nstandards, incentive structures, maintenance, and land-use planning. Risk-informed projects and \n \n1  \u201cKnowledge\u201d refers to the theoretical or practical understanding (the product of organization and reasoning applied \nto raw data). \u201cKnow-how\u201d refers to tacit knowledge (developed through a process of interaction, debate, and trial and \nerror encountered in practice).

The interface between sector-level approaches to managing \ndisaster risk continues to challenge a coherent, coordinated development-wide treatment of risk. \n \n6.  Post-disaster  recovery  and  reconstruction  is  a  complex  process.  The  number  of \nstakeholders, and the demands from affected businesses and communities to quickly return to \npre-disaster state, can override the opportunity a disaster presents to address underlying risk \nfactors. Pre-disaster recovery planning enables DMCs to address difficult and time-consuming \ndecisions and strengthen the capacity of decision-makers before an event. Laying the foundations \nfor the principles to \u201cbuild back better\u201d ahead of time can result in a more equitable and \nsustainable recovery that avoids regenerating disaster risk.7 \n \n7.  Recognizing the necessity for greater investment in disaster-resilient infrastructure across \nAsia and the Pacific, ADB member countries are spearheading important initiatives. These include \nthe G20 Quality  Infrastructure  Investment Initiative  and the  Coalition  for  Disaster  Resilient \nInfrastructure under India\u2019s leadership. The international community\u2019s commitment to SDG 9 (to \n\u201cbuild resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\u201d) and \nglobal target (d) of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (to \u201csubstantially reduce \ndisaster  damage  to  critical  infrastructure  and  disruption  of  basic  services\u201d)  also  requires \ngenerating  context-specific  knowledge  and  emphasizing  its  practical  application  in  new \ninvestments, including in post-disaster reconstruction. \n \n8.  Led by multilateral development banks (MDBs), a global infrastructure forum identifies and \naddresses infrastructure and capacity gaps to support the commitment to investing in sustainable \nand resilient infrastructure under the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.8 To support this initiative, \nproven approaches and concrete examples from DMCs offer the opportunity to demonstrate best \npractice and to highlight where additional capacity and technical support is required. \n \n9.  The TA will select a DMC from each of Central and West Asia, Pacific, South Asia, and \nSoutheast Asia Departments to benefit from country-level engagement. Provisionally, the TA \nidentified Armenia, Cambodia, Fiji, and Sri Lanka, because disaster risk management, including \nenhancing disaster recovery, is a focus and priority area for engagement in these countries.9 The \nTA will base final selection on the following criteria, taking into account the practicality of \nimplementing the TA and the resources available: (i) the existing infrastructure investment \nenvironment, (ii) high-levels of disaster risk, (iii) the portfolio and/or pipeline of ADB projects \nrelated to disaster risk management, and (iv) demonstrated willingness to engage in ADB-\nsupported capacity-building initiatives. The TA will also consider geographical balance and avoid \noverlap with support provided by other development partners. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: disaster-resilient infrastructure promoted in \nAsia and the Pacific.10 The TA will have the following outcome: action-oriented disaster risk \n \n7  W.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Disaster-resilient  infrastructure  know-how  disseminated.  The  TA  will \ndevelop knowledge products to advance upstream disaster-resilient infrastructure know-how, \nincluding linkages to the proposed Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure spearheaded by \nthe Government of India and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction\u2019s global target \nto \u201csubstantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services.\u201d \nAppropriate upstream enabling environments include disaster-resilient infrastructure standards \nand codes, risk-informed land use management, disaster risk screening and assessment tools, \ndisaster-resilient building skills and capabilities, and regulatory processes. The TA will draw on \nongoing ADB initiatives related to climate-resilient investments in critical infrastructure.12 \n \n12.  The  TA  will  help  inform  the  discourse  on  disaster-resilient  infrastructure  through  a \npublication on Asia and the Pacific\u2019s \u201cstate of play\u201d on disaster-resilient infrastructure. The \npublication will (i) build on ADB\u2019s Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs report (footnote 6), recent \nstudies supported by ADB on infrastructure climate hazard exposure, and other literature; (ii) \nassess achievement towards relevant SDGs and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \ntargets; and (iii) identify trends for policy makers in Asia and Pacific to consider in the context of \nbuilding disaster-resilient infrastructure. Additional knowledge products, including a study on how \nMDBs address disaster risk in their lending processes, will target practitioners based on identified \ngaps in response to upstream initiatives. To ensure maximum coverage, the TA will disseminate \nproducts at high-level regional and international forums, such as annual meetings of MDBs and \nUnited Nations (UN) conferences related to resilient infrastructure and sustainable development. \nThe TA will publish and widely disseminate the report digitally and make about 300 printed copies \navailable at the high-level launch of the publication. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Recommendations  for  addressing  disaster  risk  in  infrastructure \ninvestment processes identified. The TA will review (i) existing government processes (and \nassociated guidelines and tools) for selecting, appraising, and designing infrastructure projects in \nfour DMCs and (ii) opportunities to better integrate disaster risk considerations. The reviews will \ndocument existing processes, their treatment of disaster risk and implications for investment \nportfolios  and  project  design,  associated  gaps  and  challenges,  and  recommendations  for \nimprovement within priority sectors identified by the DMCs. The completed reviews will provide a \nbank of case examples of practical actions and recommendations for DMCs to integrate disaster \nrisk considerations in infrastructure project development processes. \n \n14.  The TA will provide the response to the recommendations in the country reviews, technical \nadvisory services, and capacity building to four DMCs. Areas of assistance are expected to \ninclude revising urban building codes, developing investment plans, and revising legal and \nregulatory acts. The TA will make about 200 copies available per DMC for the national launch of \nthe country reviews. \n \n15.  Output 3: Resilient recovery capacity enhanced.

The TA will help develop comprehensive country-specific post-disaster recovery plans, \nbased on detailed consultations and a needs assessment to ensure that the support builds on \nexisting efforts and is well coordinated. The TA will also contribute to the efforts of development \npartners  by  designing  and  publishing  PDNA  learning  materials  (such  as  guidance  notes, \nsimulation exercises, or tools) in the context of Asia and the Pacific. ADB will work closely with \nthe International Recovery Platform to ensure that contributions under this output build on efforts \nby other stakeholders.14 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.
