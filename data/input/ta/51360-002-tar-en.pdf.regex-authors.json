THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The Government of Turkmenistan (the government) and the Ministry of Railway Transport \n(MRT) have requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a program to \nmodernize  railways  in  Turkmenistan,  between  Turkmenabat,  Mary,  Ashgabat  and \nTurkmenbashi.1 The program is expected to be undertaken in three phases (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Proposed Phases of the Turkmenabat-Mary-Ashgabat-Turkmenbashi Railway \nModernization Program \n  Location  Length (km)  Schedule of  Foreign Investment \nImplementation  Required ($ million) \nPhase 1  Turkmenabat-Mary  243  2018-2019  200 \nPhase 2  Mary-Ashgabat  344  2019-2020  150 \nPhase 3  Ashgabat-Turkmenbashi  560  2020-2021  200 \nTotal    1,147    550 \nSource: Ministry of Railway Transport of Turkmenistan \n \n2.  It is intended for ADB to process Phase 1 as a standalone project, with Phases 2 and 3 \nfinanced through additional financing, subject to sound progress on Phase 1. This approach would \nallow ADB to help build up the EA\u2019s implementation capacity during Phase 1, and incentivize MRT \nto successfully implement Phase 1. The multitranche financing facility modality is considered \ninappropriate, due to the nascent relationship at operational level between ADB and MRT, \nchallenges associated with the government making requisite policy-level changes ex-ante, and \nthe lack of firmness of financial resources available from ADB and potential cofinanciers to cover \nall three phases. Aligned with these three proposed phases, this transaction TA facility will provide \nproject preparation support and capacity building to these ensuing projects2, comprising; \n \n\u2022  Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3 and 6 (Turkmenabat\u2013\nMary) Railway Modernization Project; \n\u2022  Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3 and 6 (Turkmenabat\u2013\nMary\u2013Ashgabat) Railway Modernization Project\u2013Additional Financing; and \n\u2022  Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3 and 6 (Turkmenabat\u2013\nMary\u2013Ashgabat\u2013Turkmenbashi) Railway Modernization Project\u2013Additional Financing. \n \n3.  All ensuing projects are in the railway transport subsector, and relate to a contiguous \n1,147km railway line. This is the arterial line for Turkmenistan\u2019s railway network, carrying more \nthan  20  million  tons  of freight  per  year,  5 million  passengers  and  linking three fourths  of \nTurkmenistan\u2019s urban population along its route. The projects collectively contribute to the \nimprovement of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3 and 6, serving the \neast-west connection between East Asia and Europe, as well as the North-South connection \nbetween the Middle East and Central Asia and beyond. The improved railway line will also benefit \nother countries in Central Asia including Uzbekistan, as their access to the deep-sea ports on the \nPersian Sea, as well as to the Caspian Sea will be improved.  \n \n                                                \n1  This lending proposal was included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Turkmenistan, 2018\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  For the purpose of this transaction TA facility, each envisaged additional financing to the first ensuing project is \nconsidered a project for which preparatory activities are required. \n ", "2   \n4.  Despite its importance in supporting regional and domestic connectivity, the line is in a \npoor state, arising from a backlog of maintenance issues inherited from the Former Soviet Union. \nThe last capital repair was completed in the 1970s. Operational speeds are limited to 36.7km per \nhour, and major safety issues exist. The poor state of the line poses a major challenge to the \nexpansion of freight and passenger train services on a reliable and safe basis. MRT prioritizes \nthe Turkmenabat-Mary section as Phase 1, due to the higher traffic volume on this section, with \nMary serving as a key junction for trains coming to and from Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. \n \n5.  The preparation of the first ensuing project and two additional financing require a similar \nset of due diligence, including safeguards, financial management, and economic assessments. \nThe transaction TA facility is listed in the current Country Operations Business Plan (COBP).3 \n \n6.  Each of the ensuing projects are considered high risk, due to (i) the challenging country \ncontext, (ii) history of implementation challenges in the previous North-South Railway Project,4 (iii) \nMRT\u2019s  limited  knowledge  of,  and  capacity  to  follow  processes  and  procedures  relating  to \ninternational financing institutions, and (iv) multiplicity of contract packages envisaged. \n \n7.  Key expenditure items envisaged under the ensuing projects include (i) material for \nreplacement rail and sleepers (ii) material for metal span structures such as bridges, (iii) signaling \nand  telecommunications  equipment,  (iv)  specialized  machinery  and  equipment  for  track \nmaintenance, (v) construction of new sleeper plant, and (vi) project management and construction \nsupervision consultants.  \n \nB.

Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $825,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA facility. CWTC will select, supervise and evaluate consultants. \nThe consultants will be attached to a program management unit (PMU) to be set up by MRT. They \nwill work with the PMU to prepare the ensuing projects. Detailed design, for those project \ncomponents  which  require  them,  will  be  conducted  by  the  government\u2019s  design  institute. \nConsultants recruited under the TA facility will help check and improve such designs as required. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  April 2018\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Railway Transport of Turkmenistan \nImplementing agency  Central and West Asia Department, ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual: individual  International, 22  $701,700 \n  selection or as  person-months, and \n  resource persons  National, 12 person-\n  months \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants  \n  Shopping  2 contracts  $10,000 \nAdvance contracting  To expedite the conduct of the TA, selection of key individual \nconsultant positions will commence through advance contracting \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nfollowing PAI 2.04. Negotiation and signing of the consulting contract \nwill only occur after the TA becomes effective. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Any equipment or software purchased under the TA will be handed \narrangement upon TA  over to the Executing Agency upon TA completion. \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, PAI = Project Administration Instructions, TA = \ntechnical assistance, TRTA = transaction technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n12.  Consulting services. The transaction TA facility will require approximately 22 person-\nmonths (PMs) of international consultants and 12 PMs of national consultants\u2019 inputs. This \nincludes a total of 2 person-months of resource person inputs, who will provide short-term, highly \nspecialized inputs in support of the project preparation. Consultants will support ADB staff in the \nconduct of standard due diligence on the proposed projects, including technical, economic and \nfinancial, governance, poverty and social, and safeguards. They will also provide capacity building \nto the EA in selected areas, including procurement and safeguards. \n \n13.  These consultants and resource persons will be recruited individually, with either input-\nbased or output-based contracts as appropriate. For project due diligence in a highly specialized \nsubsector such as railways, hiring individual consultants is more appropriate, faster to mobilize, \nand  more  cost-effective  than  firms.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  following  the  ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions.5 Apart from work on common due diligence \nrequired across all three projects (outputs 1 and 2 in Table 2), the consultants will be sent separate \nnotices-to-proceed for preparatory work on each of the three projects to be supported by the \ntransaction TA facility. Such notices-to-proceed will follow the approval of each project\u2019s concept \npaper.  \n \n14.  The consultants will procure goods, mainly in the form of software to be used for noise \nand environmental modelling and monitoring, and railway traffic modelling. These will be handed \nover to the EA upon TA completion. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nTurkmenistan for preparing the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3 and \n6 (Turkmenabat\u2013Mary\u2013Ashgabat\u2013Turkmenbashi) Railway Modernization Projects, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.\n                                                \n5  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
