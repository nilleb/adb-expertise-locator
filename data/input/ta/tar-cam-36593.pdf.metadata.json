Given the limited banking \nintermediation  in  the  country,  the  development  of  the  insurance  business  is  of  strategic \nimportance. It will complement banking intermediation and contribute to long-term resource \nmobilization.  Nonlife  insurance,  especially,  will  facilitate  commercial  activities  by  covering \nvarious business risks. Appendix 1 summarizes initial poverty and social analysis. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been instrumental in developing the insurance \nbusiness. ADB helped the Government develop a long-term financial sector development plan\u2014 \nthe Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001\u22122010 (the Blueprint),1 which identified key reform areas \nto  build  a  market-based  insurance  industry  over  10  years  starting  in  2001.  The  Blueprint \naddresses  (i)  the  supervision  and  regulatory  framework,  (ii)  compulsory  insurance,  (iii) \ninsurance industry organization, (iv) capacity building, and (v) insurance infrastructure. Based \non the Blueprint, ADB launched the Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL) cluster2 to help \nimplement  the  proposed  reforms  in  the  Blueprint.  The  FSPL  supports  (i)  establishing  an \ninsurance supervisory unit, (ii) developing compulsory insurance, and (iii) restructuring the state-\nowned insurance company. ADB provided advisory technical assistance (TA)3 in 2002, which \ncovered  compulsory  insurance  such  as  third-party-liability  motor  vehicle  insurance  and \ncontractor\u2019s  general  liability.  Following  this  initial  effort,  the  Government  requested  further \nassistance through a long-term resident advisor to develop the insurance sector, especially in \nthe  legal  and  supervisory  framework,  restructuring  of  the  state-owned  insurance  and \nreinsurance companies, and capacity building of supervisory staff of the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance (MEF). In response, ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission4 of 14-25 October 2002, \nand reached an understanding on the scope, implementation and financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference of the TA.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  insurance  industry  is  very  small  and  underdeveloped.  The  insurance  industry \ncomprises the state-owned Cambodia National Insurance Company (CAMINCO), four private \ninsurance agents, and a state-owned reinsurance company\u2014the Cambodia Re. In recent years, \nthe insurance industry has undergone some important changes. First, CAMINCO was divested \nof its regulatory function, which MEF took over in line with the insurance law of 2000.6 Until then, \nCAMINCO had regulated the insurance industry, posing conflicts of interest. MEF established \nthe Insurance Division under the Financial Industry Department (FID). Second, in January 2002, \nCAMINCO  was  divested  of  its  reinsurance  business  when  the  Government  established \nCambodia Re. In October 2002, it was transformed into a joint venture company with the Asia \nInsurance Group,7 which holds 20% of Cambodia Re. Third, compulsory insurance has been \nintroduced.  Until  recently,  only  a  few  nonlife  insurance  products  such  as  property,  health, \n                                                 \n1  Chun, B. J., X. Zhang, A. Sharma, and A. Hsu. 2001.

The TA was approved in November 2001, and commenced implementation in April 2002. \n4 The Mission comprised B.J. Chun (Financial Economist/Mission Leader) and X. Zhang (Financial Economist). \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in October 2002.  \n6  The FSPL supported the separation of CAMINCO\u2019s insurance regulatory function as part of first-tranche release \nconditions of subprogram 1. See footnote 2. \n7  The Asian Insurance Group is a consortium of five international insurance companies from Japan; Hong Kong, \nChina; Indonesia Singapore; and Thailand. ", "2 \nmarine cargo, and motor vehicle insurance had been offered to a limited scope of clients, mostly \nforeign  investors  and  international  organizations.  In  2002,  MEF  introduced  compulsory \ninsurance such as third-party-liability motor vehicle insurance, contractor\u2019s general liability, and \npassenger transportation insurance. \n \n4.  While  these  achievements  are  significant,  the  \u201cto-do  list\u201d  to  build  an  enabling \nenvironment  conducive  to  insurance  business  is  a  long  one.  First,  a  detailed  legal  and \nregulatory framework for insurance is urgently needed. Under the current skeletal regulatory \nframework, what businesses private sector operators can or cannot engage in is not clear, \nbecause many essential details remain missing. The insurance law establishes the basic legal \nbasis for defining supervisory authorities and industry business, but MEF and the private sector \nfeel that the law still leaves many areas to be fleshed out, or improved to give transparent \nguidance to insurance providers and clients. Some prudential norms (i.e., solvency margin and \nminimum capital requirements) need to be redesigned as they are unrealistic. For example, the \nminimum capital requirement for a full-fledged insurance company, set at $7 million, is too high \nto induce private insurance companies, given the market size. A foreign insurance company \nbecame an agent in response to the high minimum capital requirement. The insurance law has \nyet to provide clear references for various insurance intermediaries such as brokers and sales \nagents. \n \n5.  Second, the Insurance Division has yet to establish detailed supervisory framework and \nprudential regulations. MEF must urgently develop the following tasks to discharge its regulatory \nresponsibilities: (i) establish off-site surveillance and on-site inspection procedures and train the \nInsurance Division officers, (ii) establish a regulatory framework for a policyholder protection \nprogram, and (iii) develop an insurance database and statistics to help insurance operators \ndetermine and regulate premiums of life and nonlife businesses.  \n \n6.  Third,  capacity  building  is  urgently  needed  for  the  insurance  supervisory  staff.  The \nInsurance  Division  has  10  officers,  most  of  whom  lack  insurance  supervision  experience. \nAlthough a few officers have a background in economics and business administration, most lack \nin-depth knowledge of insurance. Long-term and systematic efforts are needed to build the \ncapacity of insurance supervisors. \n \n7.  Fourth, the insurance industry needs to be reorganized by redefining the role of the \nstate-owned insurance companies. Until 2000, CAMINCO had been regulator, operator, and \nreinsurer, and remains a dominant player in the insurance market. Recognizing potential conflict \nof  interest,  MEF  initiated  CAMINCO\u2019s  restructuring  in  2000,  first  separating  the  regulatory \nfunction and then divesting the reinsurance business. The next task is to make CAMINCO a \ncommercial enterprise and build its capacity. Based on ADB\u2019s policy recommendation, MEF \nplans to restructure CAMINCO by forming a joint venture with a private sector partner. A joint \nventure, preferably with reputable foreign insurance companies, will be of strategic importance \nin developing the insurance business, not only augmenting the capital base of CAMINCO, but \nalso  transferring  managerial  and  technical  know-how  to  it.  The  Government  established \nCambodia Re and remains committed to restructure CAMINCO through a joint venture under \nthe FSPL\u2019s auspices.8  \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram II of the Financial Sector Program and on the Progress of Subprogram I \n(Loan 1859-CAM) (approved on 28 November 2002). Manila.  ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The project aims to (i) upgrade the legal and regulatory framework for insurance based \non international best practices, (ii) build capacity of insurance supervisory staff, and (iii) help \nrestructure CAMINCO by developing a restructuring strategy and action plans. An international \ninsurance expert and a local expert will be engaged under the TA. The international insurance \nexpert  will  be  resident  advisor  to  FID  to  help  its  director  and  staff  discharge  their  daily \noperational responsibilities as insurance supervisor and regulator. The international insurance \nexpert is expected to undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Formulate a medium-term development plan to upgrade the legal and regulatory \nframework for insurance business and capacity as well as the insurance industry, \nbased on a diagnostic review of the insurance sector.  \n \n(ii)  Develop (a) procedures for on-site inspection and off-site surveillance of the \ninsurance  companies,  (b)  insurance  industry  statistics,  (c)  implementing \nregulations of accounting standards consistent with Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) standards. \n \n(iii)  Draft  a  restructuring  strategy  and  plan  for  the  state-owned  insurance  and \nreinsurance companies and help MEF implement the plan. \n \n(iv)  Provide  training  for  the  relevant  officials  and  private  sector  stakeholders  in \nvarious policy issues regarding insurance supervision and business. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA is unique in that it will use a resident advisor with a broad scope of tasks. Given \nthe situation facing FID, the demand for capacity building is multifaceted, ranging from a high-\nlevel of professional knowledge and financial expertise to simple administrative skills. The \nresident  advisor  is  expected  to  undertake  multiple  roles  in  capacity  building,  on  top  of \nprofessional consulting services. First, the advisor will be a tutor, teaching staff how to handle \nissues arising from FID\u2019s day-to-day operation. Since most FID staff are relatively young and \ninexperienced, they often face difficulties in handling routine tasks. The expert will guide them in \ndischarging their daily responsibilities. Actual assistance in daily tasks will be provided by the \ndomestic consultant under the guidance of the resident advisor. Second, the advisor will be an \non-the-job trainer to expedite the knowledge transfer for the internal expert to the FID target \nstaff. The resident advisor\u2019s TA service and training service can be integrated into FID staff\u2019s \ndaily work process since the advisor and staff work in the same office. While the resident \nadvisor is expected to provide workshop and seminar-type training, the core mechanism for \nknowledge transfer envisioned in this TA hinges on on-the-job training by the resident advisor. \nThird, the resident advisor will become a focal person to facilitate private sector consultation. As \nFID staff have no in-depth knowledge or experience, they do not easily communicate with \nprivate  sector  operators.  Most  FID  staff  do  not  necessarily  match  with  private  sector \ncounterparts. Lack of mutual trust between FID and its private sector operators also hampers \ncommunication. Thus, the resident advisor will be an honest broker to bridge the communication \ngap between them. The TA framework is in Appendix 2. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The  total  TA  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $472,000,  of  which  $333,000  is  the  foreign \nexchange  cost,  and  $139,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $333,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $67,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto  $72,000,  by  providing  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  miscellaneous  services \n(Appendix 3). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  MEF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. In addition to office space, MEF will \nprovide counterpart staff and other support services to the consultants. ADB will engage an \ninternational insurance expert and a domestic economist to provide consulting services for 9 \nperson-months each, both on individual basis. The terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. Consultants will be selected and engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  \n \n12.  Before the start of services, the consultants will prepare a detailed work plan, which will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each TA component. Consultants are required \nto deliver outputs according to such schedule and in such format as agreed on with ADB and \nMEF at contract negotiation. Each output will be reviewed by MEF and ADB. The consultants \nare required to submit to ADB a daily activity report at the end of each working month in such \nformat as agreed on with ADB and MEF when service starts. A draft final report, collating all \noutputs, will be submitted within the deadline agreed on, and work plans after incorporation of \nfeedback from MEF and ADB. A tripartite meeting will be held before finalization of the draft final \nreport. The final report, incorporating comments of MEF and ADB during and after the tripartite \nmeetings, should be submitted upon completion of service. The TA is scheduled to commence \nin February 2003 and be completed by June 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for Improving Insurance Supervision and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.

The sector supports economic growth \nby  mobilizing  resources,  especially  long-term  resources,  which  is  critical  to  infrastructure  development.  The \ninsurance sector also protects the real sectors from losses in case of catastrophes and, therefore, contributes to \nmacroeconomic stability.  \n \nFor individual livelihood, a sound and efficient insurance sector provides accessible, high-quality and well-diversified \ninsurance services for the near poor and nonpoor. During economic or other crises, a sound financial system \nreduces income fluctuation and, thus, people\u2019s vulnerability to drastic changes in socioeconomic situation.  \n \n \nB.
