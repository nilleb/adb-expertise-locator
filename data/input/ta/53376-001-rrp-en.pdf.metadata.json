I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $51,800,000 in Indian rupee equivalent to DBL Anandapuram Anakapalli Highways Private \nLimited (DBLAAHPL) for the DBL Highway Project in India. \n \n2.  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is augmenting the capacity of the 50.8-\nkilometer (km) Anandapuram\u2013Pendurthi\u2013Anakapalli section of National Highway (NH)-5 (now \nNH-16) in Andhra Pradesh by converting it from a two-lane into a six-lane road. Based on \ncompetitive bidding, the NHAI awarded DBLAAHPL the build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession, \nwhich follows the hybrid annuity model (HAM). The project will decongest a critical connectivity \ncorridor from the hinterland to the port of Vishakhapatnam on the east coast, increase traffic \nvolumes and vehicular speeds, and reduce logistics costs. The assistance is the first private \nsector road project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in South Asia. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \n  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. India has one of the largest road networks in the world, consisting \nof (i) national highways; (ii) state highways; (iii) major district roads; and (iv) rural roads, including \ndistrict and village roads. The 132,500 km of national highways represent about 2% of the entire \nroad network but carry 40% of total road traffic. About 77% of the national highway network was \ntwo-lane or less as of 31 March 2017.1 The low capacity of highways is aggravated by diverse \ntraffic, road encroachments, and poor-quality road surfaces. The capacity and quality of the road \nnetwork have not kept pace with the growth in registered vehicles. While road network capacity \nexpanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.2% in FY1951\u2013FY2017 (footnote 1), \nthe number of vehicles increased by a CAGR of over 10.7%.2 Due to an increase in number of \nvehicles and lack of enforcement of road safety measures, India witnessed the highest number \nof fatal road accidents in the world in 2019. Andhra Pradesh ranked seventh on this account \nacross all the states in India in 2019.3 \n \n4.  The  project  is  under  Bharatmala  Pariyojana,  a  Government  of  India  project  which \nenvisages constructing 66,100 km of economic corridors, coastal roads, and expressways to \nboost the highway network. Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to increase vehicular speed by 20%\u2013\n25% and reduce supply chain costs by 5%\u20136% by providing at least four-lane connectivity to 550 \ndistricts. The approved outlay for phase 1 is $73 billion, which includes upgrading 34,800 km of \nroad network by FY2022.4 The NHAI has awarded projects with an aggregate length of about \n6,400 km under Bharatmala Pariyojana, and is preparing detailed project reports for about 25,000 \nkm. The HAM is the NHAI\u2019s preferred mode of concession award. Since April 2015, the NHAI has \nawarded private developers about 7,640 km of HAM projects, 15% of which are operational, 81% \nof which are under implementation, and 4% of which have been terminated because of land \nacquisition issues. \n \n5.

The project comprises the Anandapuram\u2013Anakapalli section of NH-5, \nwhich connects Vishakhapatnam port to the Andhra Pradesh hinterland. The two-lane highway \nwill be expanded to six lanes leading to significant improvement in road connectivity to the port \n(the fourth largest in India and second largest on the east coast). The heavy traffic passing through \nVishakhapatnam city on the Kolkata-Chennai corridor will be diverted to the project, thereby \ndecongesting the city. Climate risk screening was undertaken and climate change impact on the \nproject was assessed to be medium risk. The proposed infrastructure potentially faces flooding \nrisks due to increase in heavy rainfall and storm surges caused by climate change. This has \nimpact on the drainage system, which need to be adequately sized to cope with higher runoff \nvolumes to reduce flood risk. The project design also ensures road safety and is expected to \nprevent accidents, through a highway traffic management system, cautionary and/or warning road \nsigns, and road safety devices such as object hazard markers, pedestrian facilities, and roadside \nsafety barriers. \n \n7.   (Confidential information redacted). \n \n8.  The NHAI was set up by the NHAI Act, 1988 and operates under the Ministry of Road \nTransport and Highways, and has several funding sources, including budgetary allocation from \nIndia\u2019s consolidated budget, levy on the sale of diesel and petrol, toll revenues from operating \nroads,  and  revenue  share  from  public\u2013private  partnership  projects.  The  NHAI  is  rated \ninternationally Baa3/negative (same as India\u2019s sovereign rating) by Moody\u2019s, and domestically \nAAA by CRISIL and ICRA Limited. \n \n9.  (Confidential information redacted). \n \n10.   (Confidential information redacted). \n \n11.  Borrower and Sponsor. ADB\u2019s loan will be provided to DBLAAHPL, a special purpose \nvehicle incorporated by DBL to implement the project. DBL is a leading highway developer and \ncontractor headquartered in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. DBL has more than 38,000 employees \nand owns one of the largest fleets of construction equipment in India. Dilip Suryavanshi is the \nchairperson and managing director of DBL and owns 40.3% of its shares. Devendra Jain is the \nexecutive director and chief executive officer of DBL and owns 26.0%. Seema Suryavanshi, the \nspouse of Dilip Suryavanshi, is the executive director and owns 8.7%. DBL is listed on the Bombay \nStock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India, and 25% of its shares are held by \ninstitutional shareholders and the public. DBL is rated domestically A/stable by CRISIL (reaffirmed \non 2 July 2020),5 and its market capitalization was $644.5 million as of 10 November 2020.6 \n \n12.  DBL has strong execution capability, with a fully integrated business model and in-house \ncapability to manufacture inputs used in road and highway construction.

The  project  impact  is  aligned  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  Bharatmala \nPariyojana,  which  targets  construction  of  new  roads  and  upgrading  of  the  road  network, \naggregating 66,100 km. The project will also serve as a bypass road which will help reduce traffic \nvolume passing through Vishakhapatnam city. Being a part of Bharatmala Pariyojana, the project \nwill also provide enhanced connectivity from the hinterland to the port of Vishakhapatnam, thereby \nleading to faster, safer, and more reliable cargo traffic flow which ultimately will facilitate regional \nand international trade.7 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: road connectivity improved. It will \nincrease road traffic volume, boost local employment, and contribute to the local economy through \nincreased government revenues and domestic purchases. \n \n17.  Outputs. The project outputs will be (i) road expanded and growth of local economy \nsupported; (ii) local jobs created and gender equality improved; and (iii) sexual exploitation, \nabuse, and harassment prevention strengthened. \n \n  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nthe ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities of making cities more livable, tackling remaining \npoverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability, and accelerating progress in gender \nequality.8 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, \nspecifically pillar 2: providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and social services by \nimproving the infrastructure bottlenecks in lagging regions.9 The project is connected to the \nsection of the East Coast Economic Corridor which is being supported by ADB in India.10 \n \n19.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with the following elements of the Sustainable Transport Initiative of the Transport \nSector Group: scaling up urban transport, improving cross-border transport and logistics, and \nsupporting road safety and social sustainability.11 \n \n20.  Lessons from previous operations. There has been limited nonsovereign debt financing \nby ADB for the road subsector in India. Key lessons learnt from sovereign road construction \nprojects in India are (i) managing cost over-runs, (ii) having realistic execution timeframes, and \n(iii)  having  long-term  maintenance  planning.12 The  project\u2019s  implementation  arrangements \nincorporate these lessons and ADB, as a key senior lender, will closely monitor these aspects. \n \n  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n21.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \n  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB will provide a loan to DBLAAHPL of up to the Indian rupee equivalent of $51.8 million. \nThe loan will have a tenor of 15 years with a fixed repayment schedule.  \n \n  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  The ADB assistance adds significant value by providing long-term local currency financing \nfor a critical infrastructure project, which is not readily available locally because of the financial \nmarket\u2019s risk aversion to infrastructure projects, especially roads, and the shortage of long-term \nliquidity in the non-banking finance company segment. The project is ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign \nroad project in India and will help highlight to international lenders the strength of the contractual \nstructure under the HAM for road construction. ADB's engagement will add value by ensuring that \nthe  project  will  implement  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  thereby  adopting \ninternationally recognized  environmental  and  social  (E&S)  standards, including  (i)  installing \nbarriers to minimize noise impacts in certain project sections, (ii) minimizing potential risks to \nwildlife in vulnerable parts of the project, and (iii) adequately compensating non-titleholders of \nacquired land. These measures are not required by domestic laws. ADB\u2019s involvement will ensure \nimplementation of gender-inclusive measures such as (i) targets for women\u2019s employment during \noperations; (ii) provision of female technical or engineering internships; and (iii) development of a \nzero-tolerance policy against sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment.  \n \n  Risks \n \n27.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category A), \nand indigenous people (category C).13 \n \n33.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the project\u2019s potential E&S impacts, and \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts in the safeguard \nreports and plans. Independent and qualified consultants have prepared an E&S compliance \naudit, a detailed initial environmental examination, and a social compliance audit (SCA) report. \nThe E&S measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of DBLAAHPL to manage the \nproject\u2019s E&S impacts are deemed adequate. Institutional capacity will be further strengthened to \nensure that management systems and resources are in place to implement the agreed actions \nand ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n34.  Environmental safeguards. Key construction environmental impacts and risks include \nnoise and vibration, dust, potential damage to cultural heritage assets, danger to health and \nsafety, deterioration of surface water bodies, increased traffic, and solid and liquid waste. During \noperations, key environmental impacts will include noise, traffic emissions, and public safety risks. \n \n35.  Environment, health, and safety (EHS) risks during construction are being managed \nthrough the project\u2019s construction EHS management plans. They include standard mitigation \nmeasures for the anticipated construction EHS impacts, including the use of temporary retractable \nnoise barriers. Based on the findings of ADB\u2019s due diligence assessment, the management plans \nwill be strengthened to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n36.   Confidential information redacted). \n \n37.  No internationally recognized biodiversity area is within or near the project site or study \narea. The nearest legally protected area is the nationally designated Kambalakonda Wildlife \nSanctuary. The project site and the wildlife sanctuary or its buffer zone do not overlap. A section \nof the protected area, however, is adjacent to the road to be expanded. DBLAAHPL will liaise with \nthe local Forest Department to implement mitigation measures consistent with those detailed in \nthe department\u2019s Wildlife Management Plan for the sanctuary, which will minimize the risk of \nwildlife colliding with motor vehicles. \n \n38.  Some community property resources on government and private land, including temples, \nstatues, and memorials, are within the project\u2019s right of way (ROW). The structures have been \nmoved or are being moved in consultation and agreement with stakeholders, including local \ncommunities. Progress in moving community property and the outcomes of public consultations \nwill be included in the monitoring and progress reports to be submitted periodically to ADB. \n \n39.  Social safeguards.  Confidential information redacted). \n \n40.  An independent consultant undertook an SCA to identify any past or present concerns \nrelated to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, assess compliance with statutory \nrequirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and provide mitigating measures. The audit \n \n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "6  \nincluded  (i)  examination  of  land  and  asset  valuation  and  compensation  with  respect  to \nreplacement value, (ii) a census survey of all project-affected persons (PAPs) residing in the ROW \nand their reasons for doing so, (iii) a vulnerability assessment linked to PAPs\u2019 loss of land and/or \nlivelihood, and (iv) independent market valuation of existing immovable assets. Considering the \nassessment  and  other  factors,  the  consultant  has  evaluated  the  project\u2019s  compliance  with \nstatutory requirements; alignment with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and actions required \nto close the identified gaps (including time-bound actions, budget, and resource requirements). \nThe SCA reflects the results of ongoing engagement with affected families and communities on \nland acquisition and provides a road map for further consultations and grievance management. \n \n41.  The SCA found that (i) land and asset compensation for titleholder families was higher \nthan the market value of the affected land and/or asset; (ii) the informal settlers and non-\ntitleholders were considered for asset compensation (although some gaps have been identified \nwith respect to replacement value, which will be tackled); (iii) PAPs are well aware of the land \nacquisition process and satisfied with its outcome; (iv) the company has proactively engaged with \nthe PAPs and expedited resolution of grievances; and (v) livelihood restoration measures will help \nvulnerable PAPs cope with land and/or asset loss. Confidential information redacted). \n \n42.  The SCA found no material or expected degradation or adverse impact on or additional \nvulnerabilities associated with land and natural resources on which indigenous peoples depend. \n \n43.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Women hold just 1.4% of technical and managerial \nroles in construction.14 As of September 2020, DBL had employed 900 staff members on behalf \nof DBLAAHPL, all of whom were contractors involved in road construction and 56 (6%) of whom \nwere women. The construction environment can put community members, workers, and service \nusers  at  high  risk  of  gender-based  violence  and  harassment. 15  DBL  does  not  have  a \ncomprehensive policy against sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment that encompasses all \ntypes of workers, service users, and community members. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998), DBLAAHPL has incorporated measures to promote gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action \nplan are (i) targets for women\u2019s employment during operations and construction; (ii) hiring of \nfemale ambulance paramedics; (iii) provision of female technical or engineering internships; (iv) \ndevelopment of a zero-tolerance policy against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment; and \n(v) staff training on the policy against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment. DBLAAHPL will \nsubmit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n44.  DBLAAHPL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.16 DBLAAHPL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with PAPs will follow \nADB requirements.17 \n \n \n14 S. Choudhari. 2019. Women Workforce in the Male-Dominated Construction Industry In India.
