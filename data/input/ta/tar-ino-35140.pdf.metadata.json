INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Indonesia (the Government) has committed itself to poverty reduction \nby broadening and deepening its policy and intervention in social protection. The poor in the \ninformal sector are more vulnerable to all variety of risks stemming from lack of protection against \nsevere illness, disabilities, economic downturns, unemployment, and man-made and natural \ndisasters. The Social Protection Strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasizes \nsocial protection as an important pillar of poverty reduction and complementing pro-poor growth. \nThe Government has requested ADB\u2019s assistance in preparing a sustainable social protection \nproject. The Fact-Finding Mission1 for a technical assistance (TA),2 fielded in February 2003, \nagreed with the Government on the scope of work, implementation arrangements, financing \narrangements,  and  timeframe  to  prepare  a  TA  for  the  proposed  project  that  meets  the \nrequirements of ADB funding. The proposed TA is supported by ADB and the United Kingdom \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  Partnership  for  Innovations  in  Poverty \nReduction3 Program. Appendix 1 provides the logical framework for the TA. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although poverty has declined from its peak during the economic crisis of 1997-1998, the \npoverty rate slightly increased between 2001 and 2002.4 The incidence of poverty varies between \nprovinces; in about 19 of the 32 provinces, more than 20% of the total population lived in poverty.5 \nAbout one in four Indonesians is deprived of basic social services.6 For the poor and vulnerable \npopulations a drop in income or increase in expenses can have disastrous effects on their \nstandard of living. Sickness, death, or accidents may force the disposal of productive assets such \nas land or savings. Most people working in the informal economy7 have no social protection such \nas health and disability insurance. Major illness among the poor is one of the greatest and least \npredictable shocks to their economic opportunities.8 About 86% of the population is not covered \nby adequate health insurance. The largest share of the cost of illness is related to lost income and \nnot health care expenditures.  \n3.  Poverty  alleviation  interventions  are  traditionally  focused  on  expanding  economic \nopportunities based on the assumption that individuals and families have a potential for self-help. \nWhile this is true for some population groups, others, for example the elderly or handicapped, \ncannot avail of these opportunities. With a rising proportion of elderly and trends of increasing \nurbanization, the proportion of indigent elderly,9 without extended families in rural areas to return \n                                                 \n1\n  The mission comprised Barbara Lochmann (Social Protection Specialist, Mission Leader), Axel Weber (Social \nProtection Specialist, team member), and Hereward Hill (Social Safety Net Specialist, consultant). \n2\n  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 8 January 2003. \n3\n  TA findings aim to contribute to a greater understanding of the cause effect relationships of poverty and the \ndevelopment of appropriate solutions. \n4\n  The poverty head count ratio increased by 1.3% points from 2001 to 2002, to 14.5%. The 60% increase in the cost \nof living of the poor came from increasing rice prices during the same period. \n5\n  Figures are based on the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) data from 1999. Papua had the highest incidence of \npoverty at 47.5%. \n6\n  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2000. Challenges for a New Generation. The Situation of Children and Women in \nIndonesia.

", "2 \nto, can be expected to rise.10 This will put heavy pressure on financing social security in the long \nrun and will be a large claimant on social assistance for the poor.   \n4.  Social protection in Indonesia is largely confined to social security schemes in the formal \nsector.  The social security system covers 25 million people, and is managed through state-run \nmonopolies such as Perusahan Terbatas (PT) Askes and PT Jamostek.  ADB, in cooperation with \nother  agencies  such  as  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  is  supporting  the \ndevelopment of a national social security system.11 The new Social Security Law foresees the \nestablishment of a national social security trust fund,12 to manage all social security programs (PT \nAskes, PT Taspen, PT ASBARI, and PT Jamsostek) by mid-2004. Since the extension of social \nsecurity entitlements to the entire population is a long-term goal, social safety net schemes are \nessential for the 10 million households below the poverty line.  \n5.  Traditionally, extended family members or the local community were obliged to support \ntheir poor relatives. The Social Safety Net (SSN) Program, an emergency intervention to \nmitigate the impact of the economic crisis, was set up at the onset of the crisis to support the \nGovernment in adequate service delivery for health care for the poor, education assistance, and \nscholarship programs. Drawing from lessons learned13 from ADB\u2019s two social protection sector \ndevelopment programs,14 an SSN program should support service delivery by (i) addressing \nequity and quality considerations; (ii) developing local-level management and adopting flexible \nprogram  interventions  keeping  in  perspective  regional  variations;  and  (iii)  promoting  the \nGovernment\u2019s role to shift toward standard-setting, monitoring, and capacity building. \n6.  Current formal social assistance programs remain limited in coverage and funding and \ndo not distinguish between poor and vulnerable populations. For example, the Ministry of Social \nAffairs (MOSA) has established a social welfare insurance scheme that provides cash payments \nto families when the breadwinner is sick, is injured, or dies. It is unclear how many social \nprotection schemes currently exist, what they cost, and if they complement or duplicate each \nother. Further, decentralization, which devolves central Government spending to regional levels, \nis likely to have implications on future social protection programs for the poor.15 An appropriate \ndecision on fiscal devolution and transfer of subsidies to support such obligations would make \nsuch programs more manageable at regional level.  \n7.  External support is largely confined to the development of the social security system. TA \nfor social insurance is provided through the European Union (EU), ILO, World Bank, Canadian \nInternational Development Agency (CIDA), and German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), for the \ndevelopment of a social security law and a national social insurance system.

Since external funding for SSN has \nbeen  phased  out  in  2002,  the  Government  has  continued  to  provide  funds  for  targeted \nassistance to the poor through the Fuel Compensation Scheme.16 \n8.  Indonesia  is  developing  an  integrated  social  protection  system  has  to  define  how \naffordable social protection will be composed. Because opportunities to expand coverage of \nformal social security and social insurance schemes to the poor are rather limited, it will be vital \nto  explore  options  (i)  identifying  linkages  between  formal  and  nonformal  social  protection \nschemes; (ii) strengthening informal schemes that build on traditional mutual support schemes \nand community participation for more effectively managing risks faced by the poor; and (iii) \ndeveloping strategies for vulnerable groups, which may face a high risk of sliding into poverty \nbecause of illness or unemployment. Given the many situations and circumstances leading to \npoverty  in  different  parts  of  Indonesia,  varied  approaches  and  policies  may  be  required, \nconsidering regional needs and affordability to sustain social protection interventions.  Social \nprotection policies and strategies for the poor will have to consider the  (i) vision for social \nprotection in Indonesia, (ii) who should be helped and in what kind of circumstances, (iii) \naccurate means to identify the poor and vulnerable at the local level, (iv) affordability and \npossible funding sources for such schemes, and (v) polices to support individuals who are not \ncapable of supporting themselves and live in especially difficult circumstances. Appendix 2 \nprovides the summary initial poverty and social analysis. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to develop viable and sustainable social protection schemes \nthat address the needs of the poor to reduce and cope with risks and vulnerability. The TA will \nassist the Government in preparing a draft policy framework for integrated social protection and \na project proposal to identify social protection schemes especially for the informal sector. Based \non the assessment, the TA will support development of a draft medium- and long-term policy. \nThe policy draft will incorporate the shift from a centralized to a decentralized approach of \nservice  delivery,  including  community-based  interventions  and  time-bound  strategies  for \nfinancing and operating social protection schemes.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will complement  ongoing TA and loans financed by ADB in essential social \nservices17 as well as activities of other agencies. The TA will facilitate the dialogue between \nGovernment and civil society on social protection schemes and will be implemented in close \ncooperation  with  central  and  regional  governments,  the  private  sector,  nongovernment \norganizations, and research institutions with a focus on innovative service delivery and finance \noptions for decentralized social protection schemes. The TA will be implemented in three phases \nduring 9 months.  \n                                                 \n16  The scheme channels funds for targeted assistance to the poor through line ministries to districts for pro-poor \nfinancing of basic social service delivery. \n17  ADB. 2002.

Phase I includes the following outputs: (i) poverty, vulnerability, and summary labor market \nanalyses; (ii) inventory and assessment of existing social protection policies and schemes; (iii) the \nbest practices in other countries; (iv) definition of social protection in the Indonesian context; and \n(v) policy recommendations of the national workshop. Based on the outcomes of Phase I, Phase \nII will identify unmet needs and elaborate appropriate social protection schemes through national \nand district workshops. Outputs will include (i) identification of appropriate social protection \ninterventions  distinguishing  poor  and  vulnerable  groups;  (ii)  methods  to  identify  eligible \nbeneficiaries; (iii) options for central and regional governments18 to finance social protection, such \nas  cash  transfers,  matching  grants,  and  community-based  schemes;  (iv)  costing  and \nmacroeconomic and financial frameworks to identify suitable social protection interventions using \na  bottom-up  planning  process;(v)  legal  parameters  of  social  protection;  (vi)  framework  for \ncooperation on social protection among funding agencies; and (vii) recommendations of national \nand district planning workshops on suitable project components. Phase III will provide a detailed \npolicy matrix and project description based on recommendations of Phase II, including rationale \nand expected outcomes, benefits, a fully developed logical framework, recommendations on \ninstitutional arrangements, and selection of the project\u2019s executing and implementing agencies, \nestimates of inputs and costs, a monitoring and evaluation framework for the project with \nmeasurable indicators, and a project administration memorandum describing implementation \nprocedures in detail. All project components will  be analyzed, as appropriate, for technical, \nfinancial, economic, social, and institutional viability and sustainability. \nB.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising $465,000 in \nforeign exchange and $535,000 equivalent in the local currency cost. ADB will finance $400,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program and $400,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom.  The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $200,000, through the provision of \noffice and support facilities, experienced counterpart staff for administrative support, information \nand data collection, and logistical support (Appendix 3 provides details of the cost and financing \nplan). The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be the National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS)  acting  through  its  Directorate  for  Population,  Social  Welfare,  and  Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment, and the Directorate of Decentralization and Economic Affairs. BAPPENAS will be \nresponsible for coordination across multiple line ministries for implementing the TA. To oversee \nthe TA, a technical team will be established, which will include the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nHome  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Health,  MOSA,  the  National  Family  Planning  Coordinating  Board \n(BKKBN),  Ministry  of  Manpower  and  Transmigration,  Ministry  of  National  Education,  the \nCoordinating  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare,  directors  of  regional  government  and  counselor \nassociations, and selected staff of regional governments. \n14.  The TA will provide technical support to the central and selected regional governments in \nsetting a framework for integrated social protection, identifying and costing core social protection \ninterventions  and  their  service  delivery  through  public-private  partnership  and  community \n                                                 \n18 Two districts will be selected from three provinces. Selection criteria will be based on (i) poverty incidence;(ii) fiscal \nand technical capacity of districts to ensure sustainability of integrated social protection schemes; and (iii) \ndocumented commitment of regional governments.  ", "    5 \ninvolvement. A steering committee comprising main stakeholders such as BAPPENAS, Ministry of \nHealth, BKKBN, MOSA, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Manpower and Labor, Ministry of \nFinance, the State Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment, Association of Local Governments, civil \nsociety, and universities will be constituted by the end of the first month of the TA and will meet at \nleast twice during the TA. The steering committee will be chaired by the Deputy Chairman of \nBAPPENAS for Human Resources and Cultural Affairs. An advisory committee consisting of \nrepresentatives of regional governments will be constituted in time to take part in the TA inception \nworkshop, and will provide advice to BAPPENAS on all aspects of TA design and implementation. \nThe advisory committee  will meet on a monthly basis.  A project implementation unit will be \nestablished within BAPPENAS and will be responsible for all technical and administrative aspects \nof the TA. Suitably qualified counterpart staff will be seconded to work with the TA consultant \nteam.  \n15.  The TA will use participatory workshops to advocate social protection, undertake needs \nassessments, and identify local solutions for implementing social protection schemes, including \nfor  a  loan  project.  The  TA  implementation  arrangements  will  provide  flexibility  to  allow \nadjustments to review outcomes of each phase. The consulting team, in cooperation with \nBAPPENAS, will organize workshops at the provincial and district levels to ensure participation \nof all stakeholders. The TA will be implemented during 9 months, to commence by September \n2003 and be completed by June 2004. ADB will engage a team of international (for 19 person-\nmonths) and domestic (for 33 person-months) consultants with expertise in social protection, \nincluding social assistance and social insurance; institutional development, management, and \nlegal analysis; social protection economy and financial analysis; gender and poverty; community \ndevelopment; and workshop facilitation. Appendix 4 provides the outline terms of reference for \nthe  consultants.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  through  an  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation with a local firm using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Any procurement under the TA will be conducted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n16.  The TA will be monitored and reviewed by ADB missions; regular communications with \nBAPPENAS; and inception, mid-term, and completion reports of the TA team. The TA team, in \ncollaboration with the BAPPENAS counterpart team, will organize national- and regional-level \nworkshops  to  ensure  participation  of  regional  stakeholders  in  defining  the  framework  for \ndecentralized social protection and identifying project components. Tripartite reviews will be \nheld to review progress made, and obtain input from central Government agencies, local \ngovernments, civil society, and representatives of communities. The consultants will produce (i) \nan inception report after 6 weeks, (ii) an interim report with results and recommendations from \nthe first two rounds of workshops after 10 weeks, (iii) a midterm report after 4 months, (iv) a \ndraft final report by the end of the eighth month, and (v) a final report by the end of the ninth \nmonth.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000, on a grant basis, to the Government of the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia for preparing the Sustainable Social Protection Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
