An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the Project) will provide rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) \nfacilities to about 1,760 villages in five provinces around the Tonle \nSap basin. It will include community mobilization, sanitation and \nhygiene education programs, and capacity building and institution \nstrengthening. The Project will provide an estimated 1.09 million \npeople with safe drinking water, of whom about 0.72 million will \nalso  benefit  from  improved  sanitation  facilities.  It  has  been \nformulated  as  a  sector  project.  Subproject  selection  combines \nelements of poverty targeting with a demand-responsive approach \nto ensure the sustainability of the facilities.  \n   \nRationale  Cambodia  has  made  some  progress  in  providing  water  and \nsanitation services to its people, but rural water coverage remains \nthe  second  lowest  in  Asia.  Providing  access  to  water  and \nsanitation is integral to the Government\u2019s efforts to improve health \nand  living  conditions  in  Cambodia  and  meet  the  Cambodian \nMillennium Development Goals (CMDGs). The great majority of \nrural  and  poor  households  still  rely  on  self-provision  through \ngroundwater  abstraction,  rainwater  collection,  or  the  use  of \nsurface  water,  with  little  government  investment  to  ensure \nsustainable quantity or monitor water quality. Sanitation in rural \nareas is almost nonexistent (limited to simple on-site facilities), \nand the majority of the rural population still continues to defecate \nin the open. \n  Partly due to the lack of access of safe water and sanitation, \nCambodia\u2019s infant mortality rate is the second highest in Asia and \nhas increased in the past decade. Many rural areas in Cambodia \nshow high rates of waterborne and water-related diseases. Poor \npeople\u2014particularly  women,  children,  and  the  elderly\u2014suffer \ngreatly from using water unfit for human consumption and from \npoor hygiene.  ", "iv   \n  The Government developed a national policy for water supply and \nsanitation  in  2003  that  highlights  the  need  for  a  demand-\nresponsive  approach  to  RWSS.  In  line  with  this  policy,  the \nproposed  Project  addresses  the  key  issues  that  the  sector \ncurrently  faces:  (i)  financing  of  investment  funds;  (ii)  building \nownership, and the capacity of communities to implement and \nmaintain  facilities;  (iii)  promoting  the  need  for  change  in \nassociated hygiene behavior, which reinforces the health impact \nof investments; (iv) increasing the capacity of local authorities to \nplan and facilitate sustainable investments; (v) increasing private \nsector  participation;  and  (vi)  developing  sector  strategies  and \nguidelines and partnerships. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  aims  to  enhance  the  health  of  low-income \ncommunities  in  rural  areas  by  improving  their  hygiene  and \nsustained access to safe drinking water and effective sanitation. \nThe specific objectives of the Project are to (i) strengthen the \ncommunity  capability  to  design,  cofinance,  build,  operate,  and \nmanage community-based water supply and sanitation facilities \nand increase hygiene awareness through information, education, \nand communication campaigns; (ii) improve access to safe water \nthrough  the  construction  of  adequate  facilities  based  on \ncommunity demand; (iii) expand access to sanitation facilities; and \n(iv) improve the capacity of government agencies, particularly at \nthe local level, to plan and facilitate provisions for quality water \nand sanitation services in target communities. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated to be $24.00 million, \ncomprising $7.36 million (30.67%) in foreign exchange and the \nequivalent of $16.64 million (69.33%) in local currency. \n \n  ($ million) \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total Cost  % \nExchange  Currency \nADB  7.36  10.64  18.00  75.0 \nGovernment  0.00  2.06  2.06  8.6 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  3.94  3.94  16.4 \nTotal  7.36  16.64  24.00  100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nGrant Amount  A grant of $18.0 million is proposed to be provided from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Asian Development Fund. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) \n   \n ", "  v\nImplementation  MRD  has  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU).  The \nArrangements  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  policy  and  implementation \ncoordination between MRD and other central agencies, provincial \nagencies, international development agencies, the private sector, \nand  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  (ii)  overall  project \nplanning  and  coordination;  (iii)  setting  standards  for  technical \ndesign,  construction,  and  quality  of  services;  (iv)  developing \nstandard subproject documents; (v) review and implementation of \nthe  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  and \nparticipation  in  procurement  committees  in  the  provinces  for \ncontract packages in excess of $50,000; (vi) undertaking national \nawareness campaign on water use and hygiene education; (vii) \nstandardization  and  consolidation  of  project  reports;  and  (viii) \nproviding information to the private sector on project business \nopportunities. Each provincial department of rural development \n(PDRD) in the participating provinces has established a project \nimplementation unit (PIU). Each PIU will be responsible for the \ndaily coordination and implementation of the subprojects in its \nprovince, including (i) liaison with commune councils and water \nand sanitation user groups (WSUGs); (ii) collection and screening \nof  initial  subproject  applications;  (iii)  preparation  of  provincial \nproject  implementation  plans;  (iv)  carrying  out  of  subproject \nfeasibility  assessments,  technical  design,  appraisal,  and \npreparation  of  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  contracts;  (v) \nselection  and  contracting  with  civil  works  contractors  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) as well as supervising and \ncertifying  contractors\u2019  and  NGOs\u2019  work;  (vi)  establishing  a \nprocurement committee; (vii) implementation of land acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  environmental  activities;  (viii)  with  PDRD, \nproviding  technical  support  to  communities  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of water supply systems; (ix) collection of monitoring \nand evaluation information; and (x) report preparation. \n   ", "vi   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement \nand  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nEquipment and material packages valued at $100,000 equivalent \nor  more  may  be  procured  following  international  shopping \nprocedures  or  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nPackages  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  be \nprocured  under  direct  purchasing  procedures.  Civil  works \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  or  more  may  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among \nprequalified contractors according to Government procedures and \nacceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts estimated to cost the \nequivalent of less than $50,000 may be awarded on the basis of \nlocal competitive bidding among contractors in accordance with \nGovernment  procedures  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works \ncontracts for household sanitation with a total value of $5,000 \nequivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  at  the  commune  level \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Community  Participation  in \nProcurement. The first two civil works contracts in each province \n will be subject to ADB approval. Subsequently, each PIU will \nmaintain specified documents for review by ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  An  international  firm  will  be  engaged  by  the  PMU  to  support \nproject management and implementation. An individual consultant \nwill be recruited for independent monitoring and evaluation. A total \nof 548 person-months of consulting services (98 international and \n450  domestic)  will  be  required  with  expertise  in  project \nmanagement,  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  design  and \nconstruction,  resettlement,  gender,  social  and  community \ndevelopment,  environment  management,  management  of \ncommunity water supply systems, training and capacity building, \nand monitoring and evaluation. In addition, about 1,440 person-\nmonths of services will be required for carrying out the community \nmobilization and skills development component. These services \nwill  be  procured  from  qualified  NGOs,  one  for  each  province. \nConsulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve the quality of life and health of rural \nBeneficiaries  Cambodian  people  through  improved  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater and sanitation based on community demand and needs. \nImproved  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  practices  are \nexpected to enhance health and productivity. The Project will also \nimprove the capacity of government institutions and communities \nto plan, construct, manage, operate, and maintain village water \nand sanitation infrastructure.  \n ", "  vii\n  Better-quality  water  and  improved  hygiene  will  reduce  the \nprevalence  and  severity  of  waterborne  and  water-related \ndiseases,  particularly  among  infants,  young  children,  and  the \nelderly,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  sick  days  and  health \nexpenditures. This will improve social welfare and facilitate efforts \nto improve the economic welfare of beneficiaries. Reliable access \nto  safe  water  and  sanitation  will  reduce  the  time  and  effort \ncurrently required to obtain clean water, increasing the time and \ncapacity available for income-generating activities. Given the high \nproportion of poor households in rural areas of the participating \nprovinces and the proposed targeting on the poorest communes \nwithin  these  provinces,  poverty  incidence  among  project \nbeneficiaries is estimated at 50\u201370%. \n  The  active  participation  of  the  rural  communities  in  selecting, \nplanning, cofinancing, implementing, operating, and maintaining \nthe investments will strengthen communities\u2019 ownership of their \nown  development.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in \npreparing a RWSS strategy and guidelines, as well as improve \ncoordination  and  partnerships  nationally  and  locally,  which  will \nimprove  knowledge  sharing,  avoid  duplication  of  effort,  and \nfacilitate sector planning. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  main  risks  are  (i)  changes  in  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration processes, (ii) lack of WSUG participation and \nownership  affecting  the  sustainability  of  the  systems,  (iii) \ninsufficient availability of experienced and efficient NGOs, and (iv) \nlack of access to safe water sources. The Project has included \nmeasures to mitigate the risks. \n   \n ", " \n \n \n \n \n \n ix\n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Following a request from the Government of Cambodia (the Government), the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved a small-scale technical assistance (SSTA)1 in February \n2005 to prepare the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. The SSTA, \nimplemented by Department of Rural Water Supply in the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), \nwas built upon the previous ADB-supported project preparatory technical assistance2 completed \nin  August  2002.  The  SSTA  was  completed  on  20  May  2005.  The  Government  officially \nexpressed interest in availing ADB funds for the ensuing grant.3  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s overarching goal for Cambodia, as defined in its CSP (2005\u20132009), is sustainable \npoverty reduction. To achieve this, the CSP focuses on three strategic pillars: (i) broad-based \neconomic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance. The provision of \nrural  water supply  and  sanitation (RWSS)  facilities  is  highlighted  as  one  means  by  which \ninclusive social development can be achieved, and the RWSS sector is identified as a sector in \nwhich ADB will play a catalytic role. The CSP also stresses three crosscutting themes\u2014private \nsector development, gender, and the environment\u2014that help support poverty reduction. The \nProject will contribute to all of these crosscutting themes. The Tonle Sap basin is identified as \nthe priority area where ADB interventions will be progressively focused. The Project will support \nthe  development  of  RWSS  in  five  provinces  around  the  Tonle  Sap  basin:  Battambang, \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. The Project will contribute to the \nachievement of Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs)4 to provide, by 2015, \naccess to safe water to half of the rural population and access to sanitation facilities to 30%. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  RWSS  has  been  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategy  for  rural \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The Rectangular Strategy,5 the National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy6 and the CMDGs place high priority on RWSS. Rural households account for almost \n90% of the total poor. The poverty rate in rural areas, estimated at 40.1%, is much higher than \nin urban areas, where 29.7% of the population is poor. Under-5 child mortality in the country \nstands at a high 124 per 1,000 live births, and maternal mortality is estimated at 437 per \n100,000 live births. While the number of people with access to safe water and sanitation has \nincreased since 1989, mainly as a result of external assistance, Cambodia remains the country \nwith the lowest water and sanitation coverage in East Asia and one of the lowest in the world. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

In the rural areas, the overall coverage8 is much lower at only 31.7% for \nsafe water supply and 12.5% for sanitation. \n \n5.  Water supply and sanitation coverage in the rural areas of most of the participating \nprovinces around the Tonle Sap basin is lower than the national average. RWSS assistance by \nexternal funding agencies has been quite limited in the five provinces.

The national water supply and sanitation policy (NWSSP) approved by the Government \nin 2003 states that every Cambodian in the rural areas shall have access to safe water and \nsanitation  by  2025.  The  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  improved  water  supply \ncoverage to 50%, and sanitation coverage to 30%, of rural areas by the year 2015, in line with \nthe CMDGs, as stated in its RWSS Sector Investment Plan (2005\u20132015). Details of the sector \nanalysis are in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The major constraint to the sustainable development of RWSS in Cambodia is the lack \nof investment funds. Significant investments in the sector started in 1989, when the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) provided $8.4 million in relief assistance to improve water \nsupply  in  15  provinces.  Over  the  past  17  years,  the  total  external  investment  in  RWSS \namounted  to  $110  million.  Local  communities  contributed  $11  million  in  the  form  of  local \n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 2002. World Development Indicators. Washington, DC. \n8  Improved sanitation is defined as access to adequate excreta disposal facilities, such as a connection to a sewer or \nseptic tank system, a pour-flush latrine, a simple pit latrine, or a ventilated improved pit latrine, along with a high \npercentage of good practice of hygiene. Improved water is defined by the Government as reasonable access \n(within 150 meters throughout the year) to household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug \nwells, protected springs, or rainwater collection.  \n ", "  3\nconstruction materials and labor. Details of external assistance to the sector are presented in \nAppendix 2. The investment funds required to meet the goals of the Government for 2015 are \nestimated at $116 million. Given the very tight fiscal position of the Government and the low \nlevel of cost recovery for RWSS investment, a large part of it is expected to come from external \nsources. \n \n8.  Most of the infrastructure provided by earlier assistance to RWSS in Cambodia suffered \nfrom inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M), which contributed to the failure of the \nsystems within a few years. Community management structures were not established in most \ncases and, when they were, did not receive the necessary technical support and training to \nensure efficient functioning. Lack of community involvement, especially of women, has been the \nmain reason for poor sustainability. Communities\u2019 lack of easy access to spare parts, especially \nfor water pumps, has also been a constraint. To improve the O&M of the RWSS systems, the \nProject will assist in the formation and capacity building of water and sanitation user groups \n(WSUGs). National guidelines on WSUGs were drafted during project preparation. The WSUG \nguidelines state that all users must contribute to the capital and O&M costs of the systems by \nlinking the right to use the water with these financial contributions. The poorest households, \nidentified and verified by the community, will be exempted from O&M cash contributions but will \nbe required to contribute in-kind. At least 40% of WSUG board members will be women, who \nwill account for at least half of the members receiving technical O&M training. The ethnic \nmakeup of WSUG boards will reflect WSUG membership. \n \n9.  Beneficiaries\u2019 lack of choice on the different technological and cost options available has \nled to the construction of RWSS systems that are either inadequate or unaffordable. As a result, \nmany  water  systems  have  failed.  The  NWSSP  stresses  the  importance  of  informing  the \npopulation, both men and women, about all feasible domestic water and sanitation choices, and \nof  providing  solutions  that  guarantee  the  availability  of  safe  water  that  suits  the  drinking, \ncooking, and washing needs of the population. The improvement of access to safe water and \nsanitation in areas where the quality or the quantity of the water is not adequate will require \ntesting new technologies such as (i) very deep tube wells, (ii) treatment of surface water, (iii) \nnew methods of storing and filtering water in individual households, and (iv) new types of \nlatrines. The Project will support these innovations on a pilot basis. \n \n10.  The participation of the Cambodian private sector in the construction and O&M of RWSS \nsystems, which could improve the sustainability and efficiency of the RWSS sector, remains \nvery limited. Although the number of private drilling companies is increasing, their technical \ncapabilities and size are limited by the lack of training and the scarcity of affordable access to \ncredit. In a few cases, community infrastructure is managed by the private sector. Although this \nsolution seems promising and is a good alternative to the many cases of failed community \nmanagement, little effort has been made so far to help communities and private entrepreneurs \nto enter into public\u2013private partnerships. The NWSSP defines the roles and responsibilities of \nthe  private  sector  as  providing  \u201cRWSS  infrastructure  related  services  to  communities  with \nefficiency, accountability, and in response to community demand.\u201d The same policy emphasizes \nthe  importance  that  MRD  delegate  planning and  direct  implementation  to  PDRDs,  and  so \nconcentrate on monitoring and regulation, while at the same time promoting the participation of \nthe private sector. \n \n11.  Improved community water supply will not result in full economic and health benefits \nwithout due attention to hygiene and sanitation education. Very low sanitation awareness in \nrural Cambodia hinders the development of good sanitation practices and the improvement of \npublic and household sanitation infrastructure. In rural areas, few people are aware of how good ", "4   \nsanitation improves health. Very few people use latrines, regularly clean water jars, boil drinking \nwater,  or  use  soap  when  washing  their  hands.  A  comprehensive  sanitation  awareness \ncampaign and the participation of local communities in the design of sanitation solutions must \naccompany or occur prior to the development of sanitation infrastructure. \n \n12.  Information is lacking about present RWSS coverage in Cambodia, the extent of which \nvaries greatly according to the source and the indicators used in the different surveys and \nanalyses. At least five different sources9 are used to define RWSS coverage. Each source uses \ndifferent  definitions  of  coverage  according  to  the  distance  of  users  from  the  source,  the \navailability of the source throughout the year, and the amount and quality of the water available. \nSetting up a nationwide RWSS database that uses uniform criteria and is accessible to all \nstakeholders would allow reliable assessment of RWSS provision in Cambodia. \n \n13.  While MRD has gained substantial knowledge of RWSS since its creation in 1993, much \nof this knowledge rests with a few qualified staff, often seconded to various externally funded \nprojects. At provincial and district levels, this situation may cause a recurrent lack of capacity to \nimplement projects. At the local level, the commune councils that were legally established \nnationwide after the elections of February 2002 require significant time and resources to enable \nthem  to  perform  their  delegated  functions.  MRD,  PDRDs,  and  district  offices  of  rural \ndevelopment (DORD) staff require capacity building, as do village and commune personnel. \nAlthough  the  NWSSP  and  the  RWSS  Sector  Investment  Plan  (2005\u20132015)  provide  a \ncomprehensive framework to develop the sector, the preparation of an RWSS strategy and \nimplementation guidelines are necessary to ensure the appropriate application of the policy and \ninvestment plan. Establishing a specific strategic unit within MRD is required for this purpose, as \nis a development partners\u2019 forum to support the development of the sector.  \n \n14.  The poorest are often forgotten in the decision-making mechanisms regarding water \nsupply and sanitation and, in many cases, are excluded from service. Several nongovernment \norganization (NGO)-supported projects10 have recently developed, and experimented on a pilot \nbasis, sustainable mechanisms to identify and integrate the poorest households. The Project will \nbuild upon the experiences of these organizations to identify and target the poorest 20% in each \nvillage. \n \n15.  Lack of access to safe and reliable supply of drinking water, inadequate sanitation \nfacilities, and poor sanitation awareness result in poor health for rural people, lost productive \ntime  due  to  sickness  or  the  need  to  care  for  sick  family  members,  missed  schooling \nopportunities  for  children,  and  increased  medical  expenditures.  Women  (especially  female \nheads of households) and children, primarily bear the responsibility for collecting water and are \nthe  worst  affected  by  this  situation.  The  socioeconomic  survey  carried  out  during  project \npreparation shows that water-related diseases are common among the households surveyed. \nThe most common of them is diarrhea, whose prevalence in most participating provinces is \nhigher than the national average. \n \n16.  Key lessons learned from RWSS projects in Cambodia and other Asian countries focus \non the importance of (i) promoting the construction of water points on private land owned by one \n                                                 \n9 Ministry of Rural Development. 2005.

Appendix 3 describes \nthese lessons in detail and how they have been incorporated in the Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The Project will assist the Government in achieving its RWSS Sector Investment Plan \n(2005\u20132015) national targets of increasing the percentage of the rural population with access to \nsafe water to 50%, and of sanitation facilities to 30%, in the provinces of Battambang, Kampong \nChhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  five  participating  provinces  were \nselected based on the following criteria: (i) low water supply and sanitation coverage, (ii) high \nincidence  of  poverty,  (iii)  high  prevalence  of  water-borne  diseases,  and  (iv)  geographical \nlocation around the Tonle Sap basin and synergy with other ADB interventions. The Project \naims to improve the quality of life and health of rural residents of the project areas. The Project \nis expected cover about 1,760 villages in the five provinces, providing access to safe water to \n1,087,000  people  and  access  to  sanitation  to  720,000  people  in  the  rural  areas  in  the \nparticipating  provinces.  The  Project  will  empower  communities  to  take  responsibility  for \ndeveloping and maintaining RWSS facilities according to their needs; increase awareness of \nhealthy and hygienic behavior; and improve the Government\u2019s capacity to facilitate, regulate \nand plan basic water and sanitation services. The project design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 4. \n \nB.  Outputs \n18.  The  Project  will  consist  of  four  components:  (i)  community  mobilization  and  skills \ndevelopment,  (ii)  water  supply  improvement,  (iii)  sanitation  improvement,  and  (iv)  capacity \nbuilding and institutional support. \n \n1.  Community Mobilization and Skills Development \n19.  The component will (i) strengthen community capabilities to plan, develop, cofinance, \noperate, and maintain community-based RWSS facilities; (ii) provide communities with tools to \nimprove  their  knowledge  of  hygiene  and  sanitation;  and  (iii)  help  women  and  the  poorest \nresidents  to  develop  their  livelihoods  through  information  on  water  and  sanitation-related \nactivities. Activities will be designed and implemented with the support of NGOs applying a \nuser-friendly approach that takes into account gender issues and the cultures and languages of \nethnic groups. The Project will train NGOs on participatory, gender, and technical issues and \ntools. Where appropriate, existing materials available in Cambodia and from other countries will \nbe used, and links to the activities of other organizations will be established. These activities will \noccur before, during, and after the construction of RWSS facilities to ensure maximum benefits. \nThe mobilization and skills component will do the following: ", "6   \n(i)  Run an awareness campaign in the project area to explain to the leaders of \npotentially  participating  communes  and  villages  the  project  objectives, \ncomponents, implementation arrangements, and requirements for participation.  \n \n(ii)  Identify and select target areas (districts, communes, and villages) based on the \nexisting commune planning process, when feasible, and the subproject selection \ncriteria. \n \n(iii)  Formulate water supply and sanitation village plans (WSSVP). For each pre-\nselected  village,  the  following  activities  will  be  carried  out:  (a)  information \ndissemination  on  project  activities  and  ADB  policies  on  resettlement, \nenvironment,  and  ethnic  minorities;  (b)  rapid  appraisal  of  village  water  and \nsanitation  needs  and  demands;  (c)  village  mapping  and  identification  of \nvulnerable socioeconomic groups and special needs; (d) identification of very \npoor  households  using  participatory  and  transparent  methodology;  (e) \npreparation  of  a  baseline  survey  on  the  RWSS  situation  and  waterborne \ndiseases;  (f)  assessment  of  land  acquisition  and  environment  issues;  (g) \nidentification of technical options based on informed choice and the lowest cost; \n(h) identification of potential WSUGs; and (i) preparation and submission of the \nRWSS village plans to the communes for submission, in turn, to the PIU. \n \n(iv)  Organize and support the formation of WSUGs. \n \n(v)  Run an education program on hygiene and sanitation. \n \n(vi)  Organize a community skills development program for women and the poorest \nresidents to develop RWSS-related livelihood opportunities. The program will (a) \nraise awareness of economic and employment opportunities arising from WSS-\nrelated  activities;  (b)  identify  potential  participants;  (c)  assist  the  PIU  in \nimplementing capacity-building activities in skills development for WSS-related \nactivities (installation, construction and O&M of latrines, wells, rainwater and filter \nequipment, sludge removal, etc.); and (d) provide linkage or referral to livelihood \nimprovement projects. \n \n2.  Water Supply Improvement \n20.  The Project will finance the rehabilitation or construction of water supply systems in \napproximately  1,760  villages.  It  will  strengthen  provincial  capacity  to  test  water,  including \ngroundwater testing in difficult areas, and support the introduction of new technologies. With \nassistance and advice from NGOs, the WSUGs will choose from a menu of technical options \nthat they consider to be the most appropriate based on information they receive regarding the \nsource of raw water; environmental, social, and institutional/management issues; and O&M \ncosts.  WSUGs  will  contribute,  in  cash  and  in  kind,  10%  of  construction  costs  and  bear \nresponsibility for all O&M costs. Household surveys undertaken during the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance and the SSTA suggest that the average willingness and capability to pay \nmonthly fees are sufficient to finance the O&M costs of most technical options. The component \nwill include the following: \n \n(i)  the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing water supply systems by replacing \nbroken  parts,  covering  open  wells  and  installing  pumps,  repairing  platforms, \n ", "  7\nproviding  simple  water  treatment  facilities  where  water  quality  problems  are \nexperienced, and augmenting the coverage of the systems; \n \n(ii)  the construction of new water supply systems such as wells, tube wells, ponds \nwith treatment facilities, and, in exceptional cases, small piped water systems \n(household equipment such as filters or improved rainwater-harvesting systems \nwill be provided where community options are not suitable or affordable);  \n \n(iii)  groundwater testing and soil resistivity surveys to improve the drilling success \nrate, especially in difficult areas where the water table is very low; \n \n(iv)  the introduction of innovative water supply and sanitation technologies, including \npilot trials of new water treatment facilities, pumping systems, rainwater storage \nunits,  and  latrine  types  to  assess  how  appropriate  they  are  to  Cambodian \nenvironmental and cultural conditions; and \n \n(v)  water quality testing of all water supply systems constructed under the Project, \nincluding the initial testing for chemical impurities and the supply of equipment for \nregularly scheduled biological testing. \n \n3.  Sanitation Improvement \n21.  The Project will finance the rehabilitation or construction of private and public sanitation \nsystems and raise awareness of water use and hygiene issues nationally. It will support the \ndevelopment  of  sanitation  facilities  by  providing  different  levels  of  subsidy  for  latrine \nconstruction, depending on the type and cost of the latrine. It will include: \n \n(i)  a nationwide awareness campaign on water use and hygiene education using TV \nand radio broadcasts; \n \n(ii)  the  construction  of  hygienic  latrines  for  private  households,  preceding  or \nconcurrent with the hygiene education program, where beneficiaries select from \na broad spectrum of latrine types (pour-flush, sealed, ventilated improved pit, and \ndry pit) whose standard designs, technical specifications, and estimated unit \ncosts have been prepared by the Project; \n \n(iii)  the construction and rehabilitation of public latrines in schools, markets, health \ncenters,  pagodas,  mosques,  prisons,  and  tourist  spots,  following  the \ndetermination of sustainable O&M arrangements. \n \n4.  Capacity Building and Institutional Support \n22.  The Project will (i) improve MRD, PDRD, DORD, and commune council capacity for \nfacilitating, regulating, planning, supervising and monitoring the delivery of quality water and \nsanitation services in target villages; (ii) strengthen and support private sector participation; (iii) \ndevelop a comprehensive RWSS database; (iv) support the development of the policy and \ninstitutional  framework  of  the  sector;  and  (v)  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  cooperation  with \ndevelopment partners. It will include: \n \n(i)  a capacity-building program for MRD, PDRDs, DORDs, and commune councils \non RWSS policies, planning, budgeting, financial management and accounting, ", "8   \nproject  administration,  economic  analysis,  gender  awareness,  community \nparticipation  techniques,  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  private  sector  participation,  technical  issues,  and  data \nmanagement;  \n \n(ii)  support for the private sector through the establishment of a database of private \nentrepreneurs participating in supply and management contracts in the RWSS \nsector, along with capacity building on technical and managerial issues; \n \n(iii)  the establishment of a nationwide RWSS database to serve as a reference on \ncoverage; and \n \n(iv)  institutional support to MRD for the establishment of a RWSS strategic policy \nunit, a development partners forum for RWSS, and the preparation of RWSS \nstrategy and policy guidelines.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n23.  Operation and Maintenance of RWSS Facilities. WSUGs are responsible for the O&M \nof the water supply systems. The wells will be constructed on private property except where it is \ntechnically not feasible. The property owner is expected to play a critical role within the WSUG \nfor the maintenance of the facilities. NGOs, through the community mobilization component, will \nhelp villages establish WSUGs, identify the locations of wells, and reach an agreement with \nproperty owners, in coordination with commune councils, regarding O&M responsibility, which \nclearly specifies the communal ownership of the facilities. PIUs will ensure that civil works \ncontractors prepare a plan to supply spare parts. Contracts will require private suppliers of \npumps to secure a fixed number of spare parts in a private outlet situated in every district \nserved by them under the Project. PIUs will inform WSUGs of the outlets\u2019 addresses, price \nschedules, and agreed mode of payment. The contractors will be required to guarantee at least \n6 months of successful operation after commissioning and will provide basic training to WSUGs \non O&M. Women in particular will be encouraged to participate in O&M training. \n \n24.  PIUs and consultants will provide technical support to WSUGs and piped water system \noperators during project implementation, and PDRDs will provide it thereafter. The O&M cost of \nthe piped systems will be covered by contributions to be collected from WSUG members. \nSimple  manuals  explaining  the  O&M  of  each  technological  option  will  be  prepared  and \ndistributed to WSUGs. The O&M of private latrines will be the responsibility of each household. \nThe O&M of public latrines will be done by institutions (schools, health centers, and pagodas) or \nprivate operators hired by commune councils. Clearly defined O&M responsibilities for public \nlatrines will be a precondition for providing project funds for public latrine construction.  \n \n25.  Poverty Focus. The poorest residents will be targeted in three ways. Most broadly, \nparticipating provinces have been selected based on high poverty incidence. More narrowly, \nsubproject pre-selection criteria give priority to villages in the poorest 20% of communes in each \nprovince.  Within  villages,  residents  will  identify  the  poorest  20%  of  residents  during  the \npreparation of their WSSVPs, with the verification of village chiefs, commune councils, and \nsupporting NGOs. The Project will ensure that the poorest households are included in WSUGs \nor as recipients of a household solution. Household water supply systems will be provided when \ncommunity options are not possible. All households will be able to select affordable sanitation \noptions, as the options are subsidized based on the technology used. The poorest residents, \nwho have been identified, will be exempted from contributing cash but will still be required to \n ", "  9\nmake contributions in-kind toward the cost of water supply systems. Sanitation options will be \nsubsidized based on the levels of technology and cost, so that even the poorest will be able to \nafford the most basic latrine. The skills development subcomponent under component 1 will \ntarget the poorest and women in generating awareness about RWSS-related job opportunities \nand training in construction and O&M for civil works supported under the Project (e.g., resource \ngroups). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 5. \n \n26.  Gender Focus. The Project will increase access to safe water and proper sanitation for \nrural men and women. A gender analysis was conducted for the Project to determine the water \nuse and hygiene education needs of both men and women. About 52% of the combined \npopulation of the five provinces is female, and close to 27% of all households are headed by \nwomen. Women will experience greater benefits in terms of time-savings, a reduced burden of \nlabor, and improved family health. The gender working group within MRD will develop national \nguidelines for mainstreaming gender in the rural water supply and sanitation sector. As water \nusers, women will constitute at least 40% of the WSUG board and about half of board members \nthat attend training on the O&M of water supply systems. In addition, the Project supports the \nincreased participation of men in hygiene education programs, which are traditionally attended \njust by women. At least 40% of all participants in hygiene education will be men. A summary \ngender action plan has been prepared (Appendix 6).  \n \n27.  Support to Private Sector Participation. The Project will encourage private sector \nparticipation in the RWSS sector. All civil works and supply of equipment and materials for the \nProject will be awarded through competitive bidding to private companies. Where necessary, \nthe Project will provide assistance to the commune councils to enter into partnership with private \nsector operators to help them manage, in coordination with the WSUGs, the water supply \nfacilities,  particularly  piped  water  systems,  through  standardized  service  or  management \ncontracts developed by the Project. Training on the potential and modalities for private sector \nparticipation in RWSS will be provided to MRD, PDRD, DORD, and commune council staff, and \ntraining on technical standards will be provided to private sector companies. The Project will \nalso establish a database of private sector contractors, equipment, and service providers and \nwill pass this information to PIUs, commune councils, and WSUGs. \n \n28.  Geographical Focus on the Tonle Sap Basin. The geographical focus of the Project is \nconsistent with the CSP geographical priorities and will contribute to the implementation of the \nTonle Sap Basin Strategy.11 In particular, the Project will contribute to two of the strategic \nprinciples  of  the  strategy.  First,  it  will  improve  the  livelihoods  of  the  local  population  by \nincreasing their (i) physical capital in terms of water supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) human \ncapital through improved health; (iii) social capital by giving more power to the villages and \nsupporting the establishment of WSUGs; and (iv) natural capital by educating beneficiaries on \nenvironment-friendly  methods  of  water  use  and  disposal  of  human  waste.  Second,  it  will \ncontribute to improved social justice by giving special priority to the poor and vulnerable groups \nand by supporting equal access for women to opportunities created by the Project. The Project \nwill  also  contribute  to  the  core  areas  of  intervention  of  the  strategy,  particularly  human \ndevelopment, by reducing waterborne and water-related diseases associated with the lack of \nsanitation and safe water. \n \n29.  Decentralization and Deconcentration. Subprojects will be pre-selected according to \nthe national commune planning process that aims to encourage democratic decision-making \nprocesses at the local level. However, there will be some flexibility to select subprojects outside \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005. The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. ", "10  \nthe commune planning process. Community procurement, managed by communes and villages, \nwill be promoted by the Project for those communes with enough management capacity for \nhousehold sanitation projects of less than $5,000. The identification of the targets areas and \nsubprojects, preparation of annual plans, and selection of NGOs and contractors will be done \nprimarily at the provincial level with adequate support from the PMU and consultants. Provincial \nrural development committees will have the opportunity to review the proposed annual plan \nprepared by the PIU, and the governor of each province will approve it. \n \n30.  Transparency and Quality Control. The Project will maximize transparency and quality \ncontrol in the RWSS sector in general, and in the implementation of the Project in particular. \nMRD will set up a website to disseminate the national sector policy, RWSS strategy, sector \nguidelines, investment plans, projects, and business opportunities for the private sector. The \nwebsite will also provide detailed information about project activities such as project documents, \nimplementation arrangements, rights and responsibilities of each stakeholder, selected villages, \nprocurement information, contract awards, and project performance monitoring and evaluation \nindicators. The community mobilization component will help rural communities understand and \nmonitor the Project. PIUs in each of the participating provinces will inform the rural communities \nabout the Project and possibilities for their participation and monitoring. NGOs implementing the \ncommunity mobilization plan will discuss the rights and responsibilities of the villagers and \ngovernment agencies, the available technical options for water supply and sanitation, and the \nneed for sustainable O&M. Village and commune representatives will witness the opening of \nfinancial proposals received from bidders for the civil works affecting their communities. \n \n31.  Identification  and  Selection  of  Subprojects.  The  identification  and  selection  of \nsubprojects  will  follow  the  commune  planning  process  set  by  the  Government  within  the \ndecentralization process. Each PIU will select an appropriate NGO active in rural water supply \nand sanitation in the participating province to carry out community mobilization activities. They \nwill perform, on an annual basis, the following actions: (i) issue a notice to all commune councils \nin the participating province and, through them, to the villages in the participating provinces, \ndescribing  the  Project,  its  objectives,  scope,  and  organization:  (ii)  in  conjunction  with  the \nselected  NGO,  invite  representatives  from  the  commune  councils  and  villages  in  the \nparticipating province to a district meeting to explain procedures and conditions to participate in \nthe Project; (iii) attend the district integration workshops to determine a village\u2019s interest in \nbecoming a subproject and thereby participating in the Project; (iv) pre-select the villages to be \nincluded in the Project during that year and prepare an annual plan for circulation to the PDRD \nand approval of the provincial governor; (v) ensure that the selected NGO assists each pre-\nselected village in preparing a WSSVP suitable for inclusion in the Project; and (vi) oversee \nsubmission of the village plan to the applicable commune council for approval. In the event that \na village is justifiably not represented at the district workshop but is interested in participating in \nthe Project, it may still apply to the PIU directly. \n \n32.  Criteria for Selection of Subprojects. PIUs will select subprojects for each village and \nprepare annual plans based on the following criteria: (i) the depth of poverty of the village as \ndemonstrated by the poverty ranking of its commune12; (ii) existing water supply coverage in the \nvillage as demonstrated by the initial project proposal submitted by the village and confirmed by \nthe commune council13; (iii) geographic coherence and contiguousness of the proposed villages \nfor each year of project implementation; (iv) village commitment as demonstrated by (a) a \nrequest by the village for inclusion in the Project, (b) availability of necessary land, (c) a \n                                                 \n12 Priority will be given to villages found in the poorest 20% of communes in each province.  \n13 Priority will be given to villages in communes where the safe water supply coverage is 20% or less.  \n ", "  11\nresolution to form at least one WSUG, and (d) resolution to meet the required contributions for \ncapital cost and O&M for the project facilities to ensure their sustainability; (v) health indicators \nas demonstrated by the prevalence of diarrhea; (vi) ethnic balance between proposed villages; \nand (vii) the absence of duplicative assistance in RWSS from another donor. A village will be \nexcluded from the Project if the requested water supply and sanitation facilities will cause \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  require  significant  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR). The criteria will be explained to the representatives of communes and \nvillages during the district meetings organized by the PIUs. The names of the selected villages \nincluded in each provincial annual plan will be published in the project website.  \n \n33.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Past experience with RWSS projects suggests \nthat subprojects can be designed without severely affecting people and households. Preliminary \nLAR investigation has been built into the community decision-making process. Each WSSVP \nwill include a LAR investigation for the selected civil works in that village. Community wells and \nhousehold latrines will be built on private land, where land acquisition will not be necessary. \nHowever, very minor land acquisition may be required for bigger water supply systems (e.g., \nponds and small piped water systems) and public latrines. The PIU will prepare a LAR plan for \neach cluster of subprojects for ADB concurrence. A LAR framework has been prepared to guide \nany land acquisition. A summary is in Appendix 7. \n \n34.  Environment. The Project may have some minor and temporary environmental impacts, \nresulting mainly from the construction of water supply facilities and latrines. Drilling of wells will \ngenerate noise, dust, and fumes, and the construction process will produce solid waste and \nother debris. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were conducted for the Project as a \nwhole and two sample subprojects. As the IEE summary states, these impacts will be minor, \ntemporary, and confined to the area immediately surrounding the drilling and construction. An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared to ensure that \nfuture subprojects will be screened with appropriate environmental screening criteria, and the \nrequired mitigation measures and monitoring plans with adequate budgets will be developed \nand implemented. A summary IEE is in Appendix 8. \n \n35.  Sector Approach. The Project follows a sector approach based on the three pillars for \nsector projects: (i) a 15-year sector investment plan prepared by MRD, (ii) a basic policy \nframework established through the NWSSP, and (iii) sufficient institutional capacity in MRD to \nimplement  the  investment  program.  The  Project  will  support  each  of  those  aspects  by \n(i) improving MRD and PDRD planning capacities for investment in the sector in project areas; \n(ii) expanding the policy framework through the preparation of a RWSS strategy and guidelines; \nand (iii) improving the institutional capacity of MRD and PDRDs in project management, finance \nand accounting, gender, environment, resettlement, and technical aspects. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n36.  The total cost of the Project is estimated to be $24.00 million equivalent, comprising \n$7.36 million (30.67%) in foreign exchange and $16.64 million (69.33%) equivalent in local \ncurrency. The cost estimates include the provision of $1.84 million for taxes and duties.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  MRD will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. MRD has established a project \nsteering committee comprising the departments concerned within MRD and representatives \nfrom the participating provinces\u2019 PDRDs. The committee will be chaired by an MRD secretary of \nstate and meet at least every 3 months to coordinate project activities. MRD has established a \nPMU with a part-time project director, full-time project manager, and other full-time staff with \nappropriate technical qualifications, including an environmental and a resettlement officer. The \nPMU will be responsible for coordinating with ADB and other central, provincial and international \nagencies; overall project planning and coordination; monitoring of gender and social safeguard \n ", "  13\nissues; setting standards for technical design, construction and quality of services; developing \nstandard subproject documents; standardizing and consolidating project reports; policy reforms, \nand providing information to the private sector on project business opportunities. \n \n39.  Each PDRD in participating provinces has established a PIU with a part-time director, a \nfull-time PIU project manager, and other full-time staff with appropriate technical qualifications, \nincluding an environmental officer. Each PIU will be responsible for daily coordination and \nimplementation  of  the  subprojects  in  the  participating  provinces,  including  (i)  liaison  with \ncommune councils and WSUGs; (ii) collection and screening of initial subproject applications; \n(iii) preparation of provincial project implementation plans; (iv) carrying out subproject feasibility \nassessments, technical design, appraisal, and preparation of bidding documents for civil works \ncontracts; (v) preparation of a LAR plan and IEE for each cluster of subprojects; (vi) selection \nand contracting with civil works contractors and NGOs, as well as supervising and certifying \ncontractors' and NGOs' work; (vii) provision of technical support to communities for O&M of \nwater supply systems; (viii) collection of monitoring and evaluation information; and (ix) report \npreparation.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  project  institution  are  in  Appendix  11. \nDetailed terms of reference have been prepared for each member of the PMU and PIUs. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years commencing in 2006. An \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 12. \n3.  Procurement \n41.  Procurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Equipment  and  material  packages  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  more  may  be \nprocured  under  international  shopping  or  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nPackages valued at less than $100,000 equivalent will be procured under direct purchasing \nprocedures. Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or more may be awarded on \nthe basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified contractors according to Government \nprocedures  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  civil  work  contracts  with  a  total  value  of  $50,000 \nequivalent or more will require the presence of a PMU member in the procurement committee \nand will be submitted to ADB for approval. Civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent \nof  less  than  $50,000  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among \ncontractors in accordance with Government procedures and acceptable to ADB. Civil works \ncontracts for household sanitation estimated to cost the equivalent of $5,000 or less can be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. The first two civil \nworks contracts in each province will be subject to ADB approval. Subsequently, the PIU will \nmaintain specified documents14 for review by ADB. PIUs will be responsible for preparing the \nbidding documents and contracts, chair the procurement committees and awarding contracts for \nall civil works. The proposed procurement packages are in Appendix 13.  \n \n                                                 \n14 These include the water supply and sanitation village plan, bid invitation letters, bid opening statements, bid \nevaluation reports or approval documents, and signed contracts between the project implementation units or the \ncommune council and the contractors. ", "14  \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  An  international  firm  will  be  engaged  by  PMU  to  support  project  management  and \nimplementation following the quality and cost-based system. An individual consultant will be \nrecruited for independent monitoring and evaluation. A total of 548 person-months of consulting \nservices  (98  international  and  450  domestic)  will  be  required  with  expertise  in  project \nmanagement, rural water supply and sanitation design and construction, resettlement, gender, \nsocial and community  development, environment management, management of community \nwater supply systems, training and capacity building, and project performance monitoring. In \naddition, about 1,440 person-months of services will be required for carrying out the community \nmobilization and skills development component. These services will be procured from qualified \nNGOs, one in each province, selected through a competitive process. Consulting services will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  It is envisaged that payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the grant will \nbe made either through direct payment or imprest account procedures in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January 2001. To ensure the timely release of grant \nproceeds, and to expedite project implementation, the Ministry of Economy and Finance will, \nimmediately  upon  grant  effectiveness,  open  an  imprest  account  in  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia and authorize the PMU to use it. The PMU and each PIU will also set up a second-\ngeneration imprest account, at the provincial level, with a commercial bank acceptable to the \nGovernment and ADB for disbursement of eligible funds for small contracts. The PMU and PIUs \nmay use the statement of expenditure procedure for replenishing the imprest accounts, provided \nthat each individual payment does not exceed $50,000. \n \n44.  The imprest accounts will be used, managed, replenished, and liquidated by the PMU in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial deposit to the imprest account \nwill be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, to be \nprepared by the PMU and PIUs, but will not exceed the combined ceiling equivalent of $1.3 \nmillion, with a ceiling of $200,000 for each second-generation imprest account. Withdrawal \napplications, including imprest account replenishment requests, will be prepared by the PIUs \nand sent through the PMU to the Ministry of Economy and Finance for approval. Each imprest \naccount will be managed by the PMU or PIU with the validation of the consultant team leader, in \naccordance with detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. No disbursement \nof grant proceeds will be made to a participating province if misprocurement has been found by \nADB  or  procurement  has  been  identified  as  irregular,  until  the  misprocurement  or  other \nirregularity has been corrected by the province concerned to the satisfaction of the Government \nand ADB. Each WSUG will provide a contribution of 10% of the total project cost, of which 3% \nwill be in cash and 7% in-kind. The cash contribution from WSUGs will be deposited in a bank \naccount at the provincial level, which is managed by the PIU. Poorest households will be able to \nmake their entire 10% contribution in kind with no cash contribution required. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n45.  A  separate  accounting  system  for  project  expenditures  will  be  established  and \nmaintained in accordance with sound accounting principles. The consultant will provide training \non the use of the imprest accounts and operating support to PMU and PIU accounting staff. All \nproject accounts, will be audited annually as part of the regular audit by a single auditing firm \nacceptable to ADB, using international accounting and auditing standards. The consolidated \n ", "  15\naudit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the Government's fiscal \nyear. The audit opinion will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and \ninternal control systems regarding project expenditures and transactions to ensure safe custody \nof  project-financed  assets;  (ii)  a  determination  as  to  whether  the  Government,  MRD,  and \nparticipating provinces have maintained adequate documentation for all financial transactions, \nspecifically including the statement of expenditure and imprest account procedures; and (iii) \nconfirmation  of  compliance  with  the  project  financial  management  system  and  ADB \nrequirements for project management.  \n \n46.  The PIUs will submit quarterly reports and data to the PMU within 15 days of the end of \neach quarter. The PMU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, site reports, \ntechnical and financial reports and submit them to ADB and (ii) prepare quarterly progress \nreports within 30 days of the end of each quarter, a midterm project evaluation report, and an \noverall project completion report. The quarterly report will include (i) a narrative description of \nprogress made during the reporting period; (ii) modifications, if any, to the implementation \nschedule;  (iii)  details  of  land  use  and  resettlement;  (iv)  information  on  preparation  and \nimplementation of IEEs; (v) major project activities by PMU, PIUs, and NGOs; (vi) financial and \nprocurement-related information; (vii) problems experienced and remedial actions proposed; \n(viii) the work to be carried out during the upcoming reporting period; and (ix) a summary of \nexpenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures to date.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n47.  A comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) has been prepared. A \nset of PPMS indicators have been developed. The PPMS will be integrated into the information \nmanagement  system  of  the  MRD  and  PDRDs,  to  be  developed  under  the  institutional \ndevelopment component, so that the monitoring of social and economic benefits can continue \nbeyond project implementation. During project implementation, the PIUs in each province will be \nresponsible for ensuring that the PPMS is implemented and updated, in consultation with the \nlocal communities, to (i) examine the project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate the delivery \nof the planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of the Project\u2019s objectives, (iv) ensure \ncompliance  with  social  safeguards,  and  (v)  measure  the  Project\u2019s  benefits.  Annual  PPMS \nreports will be prepared by each PIU, then consolidated by the PMU and submitted to ADB. The \nintegrated  system  for  the  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts, \noutcomes, and outputs accords with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Monitoring System  Handbook. \n \n48.  Project  outputs  will  be  monitored  in  the  regular  course  of  the  Project  in  terms  of \nefficiency (quantities delivered, trained persons, meetings) and effectiveness (quality of the \ngoods and services delivered). The PPMS will generate data on the immediate effects and the \nbroader impacts of project investments on socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and \nthe level that women and vulnerable groups participate and the degree to which they benefit. A \nbaseline  survey  will  be  carried  out  within  each  community  at  the  start  of  activities.  Data \ncollection will be organized by the NGOs through villages and communes, and the data stored \nin a database maintained by the PIUs and PMU. The PPMS expert will provide guidelines and \ntraining for the design and maintenance of these databases. All monitoring data and indicators \nwill be disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and income. In addition to the normal PPMS, an \nexternal  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  individual  consultant  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be \nrecruited to independently assess project effectiveness. The PMU will also appoint an external \nmonitoring entity, acceptable to ADB, for LAR activities. \n ", "16  \n8.  Project Review \n49.  MRD  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint  project  reviews  at  least  twice  a  year  and  a \ncomprehensive project review about 36 months after grant effectiveness. The comprehensive \nproject review will evaluate (i) the actual progress of each project component in each province, \n(ii) implementation procedures, (iii) feedback from PPMS activities, (iv) the functioning and \nperformance of the PMU and PIUs, (v) the performance of consultants and NGOs, and (vi) the \nfinancial performance and cost recovery of WSUGs will be evaluated.  \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy \n50.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s Anti-corruption Policy was explained to government \nofficials. Attention was drawn to the newly revised section on fraud and corruption added to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the \nneed for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of \nethics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and \ncorruption are discovered. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n51.  The Project will directly benefit an estimated 1.09 million people with improved safe \ndrinking water facilities, of which about 0.72 million will also benefit from improved sanitation \nfacilities in the project area. The Project is expected to realize its anticipated benefits without \nsignificant adverse impacts. Limited adverse impacts identified in the analyses were eliminated \nor mitigated in the design of the Project. \n \n52.  Poverty Reduction Impacts. The five provinces have a combined population of 3.5 \nmillion people in 2005, of whom 1.35 million (39%) live below the official poverty line. About \n85% of the total population in the five provinces is rural. Rural households, whose primary \nsource of income comes from agriculture, account for almost 90% of Cambodia\u2019s poor. The \nProject is expected to meet the CMDG targets 7.10 (50% of the rural population to have access \nto safe water) and 7.12 (30% of the rural population to have access to improved sanitation) in \nthe five provinces by 2011. About 50\u201370% of the project beneficiaries are expected to be poor \ngiven the high proportion of poor engaged in agriculture in the project provinces, and the \ntargeting of the poorest households and communes in the project area. The provision of RWSS \noptions will not discriminate against any communities or households due to ethnicity. \n \n53.  Gender and Social Impacts. Improved access to safe and reliable water and sanitation \nwill result in time savings, a reduced burden of labor, and improved family health. Women in \nparticular will benefit from the time savings and improved access to safe water by having more \ntime to participate in income-generating activities, and to attend to school. As active members of \nWSUGs and WSUG boards, women will have equal opportunities to receive technical training \nand RWSS-related skills development under the Project. Better-quality water and access to \nimproved sanitation will also reduce the prevalence and severity of waterborne and water-\nrelated diseases. Hygiene and sanitation education for both men and women will complement \nthe RWSS infrastructure. Improved access to infrastructure and better understanding of proper \nhygiene practices will contribute to fewer days lost due to sickness and a reduction in related \n ", "  17\nhealth expenditures. The Project will also contribute indirectly to achieving CMDG target 4.1 \n(reducing by half the mortality rate among children under the age of 5).  \n \n54.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits. The Project will have a positive impact on the \nlocal environment of project areas due to improved access to safe drinking water and sewerage \nmanagement based on new latrines and septic tanks. The quantity of sewage and waste \ndisposed of into rivers will reduce. The IEE found that potentially adverse environmental impacts \nare minor, temporary, and possible to mitigate. An EARF has been developed to guide the \nenvironmental assessment and implementation of environmental mitigation, as well as monitor \nenvironmental conditions during project implementation. \n \n55.  Community Empowerment. The Project will have a positive impact on communities\u2019 \ncapacity to promote their own development. Their active involvement in selecting, planning, \ncofinancing, and implementing project interventions, and their taking responsible for the O&M of \nthe facilities, will drive their empowerment. The communities will subsequently be able to use \nthese skills and enhanced social capital to undertake other community improvement activities. \n \n56.  Ethnic  Minority  Groups/Indigenous  Peoples.  The  Project  will  benefit  all  ethnic \nminority groups and indigenous households equally. Specific actions have been incorporated \ninto  the  project  design,  which  include  (i)  subproject  selection  criteria  that  consider  ethnic \nbalance in the selection of subproject villages, (ii) village mapping to identify where different \nethnic  groups  live,  (iii)  WSUG  boards  are  representative  of  the  ethnic  composition  of  the \nWSUGs, (iv) water use and hygiene education to incorporate the water and sanitation needs of \ndifferent ethnic groups, and (v) the inclusion of ethnicity issues in the project guidelines.  \n \n57.  Increased  Government  Capacity  and  Coordination.  MRD  and  the  participating \nPDRDs and DORDs will improve their performance to better plan, regulate, and facilitate the \ndevelopment of the RWSS sector. Provinces, districts, communes, and villages will develop the \ncapacity to take new responsibilities. The Project will promote greater transparency regarding \nthe provision of information and decision-making processes at all administrative levels. The \ncapacity of government officials working in RWSS will be improved in such areas as project \nmanagement planning and administration, financial management and accounting, community \nparticipation  techniques  and  gender  awareness,  data  collection  and  management,  public\u2013\nprivate partnerships, environmental and resettlement issues, and such technical aspects as \nmonitoring water quality and supervising drilling operations. The establishment of a strategic \nunit on RWSS and a development partners forum will improve the efficiency of the sector by \nproviding new opportunities for better flow of information among all stakeholders, increased \ncoordination and sharing of good practices and lessons learned.    \n \n58.  Economic Benefits. The economic benefits of the water supply component include both \ncost savings relative to current water use and welfare improvements from increased water use. \nWater supplied by the Project has a lower total economic cost (based on storage costs and time \nspent  in  collection)  than  current  supplies,  so  the  Project  will  reduce  the  resources  that \nhouseholds are required to commit to maintain their current, minimal water use. The lower cost \nwill enable households to increase their water consumption, providing additional benefits that \nwould not be available without the Project. The economic analyses of sample subprojects \nconfirm that the Project's benefits will exceed its costs. It shows that the proposed investments \nfor each village have a strong economic basis, with an economic internal rate of return of 19.5\u2013\n23.9%, well above the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. As the benefit-cost \nanalysis  did  not  include  many  potentially  important  environmental  and  health  benefits,  the \neconomic internal rate of return is a conservative estimate of economic benefits in each village. ", "18  \nDetails of subproject economic analysis are in Appendix 14. Communities will be responsible for \nchoosing from among the available options the water supply system that best suits their needs \nand circumstances. Construction and O&M costs will be significant factors contributing to their \ndecisions. Household surveys undertaken during the PPTA suggest that the average willingness \nto pay a monthly fee is sufficient to finance the O&M costs of most technical options. The \napplication of the economic criteria described in Appendix 14 identifies the least-cost option for \neach village. However, villages can opt for a higher-level system that provides easier access \nand costs more, as long as they agree to shoulder the additional costs. \n \nB.  Risks \n59.  Changes  to  the  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration  Processes.  The  Project \nassumes continued Government support for the decentralization and deconcentration policies. \nHowever, uncertainty exists regarding the modalities and depth of these policies that may affect \nthe responsibilities of provincial or commune authorities. The Project has been designed with \nenough flexibility to allow a smooth transition to a different model and easy adaptation of project \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n60.  Lack of WSUG Participation and Ownership Negatively Affect the Sustainability of \nthe Systems. The social cohesion required within the WSUGs to manage RWSS schemes on a \nsustainable basis is not always present in the rural communities in Cambodia. The community \nmobilization component will support the establishment and sound operation of the WSUG to \nensure that they mobilize sufficient resources and are willing to pay their O&M costs. Each \nWSUG will cofinance, participate in the design of, and take full responsibility for the O&M of \nRWSS facilities to ensure its long-term sustainability. A contribution plan is in Appendix 15. \n \n61.  Insufficient Availability of Experienced and Efficient NGOs. The key to the effective \nempowering  of  communities  lies  with  NGOs.  However,  experienced  NGOs  are  generally \nexpensive and in short supply in Cambodia. Intensive training of NGOs, coupled with close \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  back-stopping,  will  be  required  to  ensure  quality  control  and \neffective community mobilization. The Project has allocated sufficient resources to intensively \ntrain NGOs and supervise their performance.  \n \n62.  Lack of Access to Safe Water Sources. For particular villages, especially those where \nsurface and shallow groundwater is of very poor quality due to higher contents of arsenic, iron, \nor other pollutants, or where the water table is very low, finding an appropriate and affordable \ntechnical solution for RWSS may be difficult. The Project will undertake an initial environmental \nscreening for each village before the communities finalize a WSSVP. Pilot groundwater testing \nwill be done under the Project for the difficult cases, and new technologies will be tested. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n63.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 3 months of grant effectiveness, MRD will have established an RWSS \nstrategic unit with two full-time professional staff in charge of developing an \nRWSS strategy and a set of guidelines for its effective implementation. MRD will \nalso establish, within 6 months of the effective date, an RWSS development \n ", "  19\npartners\u2019 forum with representatives of the key development partners and NGOs \nactive  in  the  Cambodian  RWSS  sector,  to  support  the  work  of  the  RWSS \nstrategic unit. \n \n(ii)  Within 24 months of the grant effectiveness, MRD will have promulgated an \nRWSS strategy. \n \n(iii)  Within 36 months of grant effectiveness, and pursuant to the RWSS strategy \nreferred  to  above,  MRD  will  promulgate  the  following:  (a)  guidelines  on \nmainstreaming  gender  in  the  RWSS  sector,  (b)  guidelines  on  community \nparticipation for RWSS systems, (c) guidelines on contributions and subsidies for \nRWSS  systems,  (d)  guidelines  on  private  sector  participation  in  RWSS,  (e) \nguidelines on planning for the RWSS sector, (f) guidelines on water monitoring \nand  water  quality  testing,  (g)  guidelines  on  participatory  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and (h) guidelines on the O&M of RWSS. In the same timeframe, \nMRD will update the 1995 Guidelines on Water Use and Hygiene Education. \n \n(iv)  MRD will ensure that the contribution of WSUGs cover at least the cost of O&M \nof the RWSS systems. PDRDs will provide technical support to the communities \nin the project areas to ensure continued O&M of the systems. \n \n(v)  MRD will ensure that the gender action plan agreed by the Government and ADB \nis fully implemented. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that (a) at least \n40% of each WSUG board is female, and (b) women account for 50% of WSUG \nboard members trained in water supply O&M. MRD will ensure that contracts \nwith NGOs carrying out community mobilization require that (a) at least 25% of \nthe NGOs\u2019 community mobilization team is female; (b) the training carried out by \nNGOs and the PIU as part of the skills development subcomponent is directed \ntoward the poor and vulnerable, and that at least 40% of those trained are \nfemale; and (c) at least 40% of all hygiene and sanitation education participants \nare male. \n \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  its  laws  and  regulations  governing \nenvironmental impact assessments, as well as ADB's Environment Policy (2002), \nare followed. If there are any discrepancy between the Government laws and \nregulations  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements will apply. Each PIU will conduct an environmental assessment for \neach subproject based on the EARF and will prepare an IEE based on a cluster \nof subprojects. MRD will ensure that IEEs (a) are based on the sample IEE made \nduring project preparation, (b) meet ADB\u2019s Environment Policy requirements, (c) \ninclude details of local consultation carried out, and (d) are submitted to ADB for \napproval prior to civil works contracts being awarded for the subproject if any \ncritical  environmental  issues  are  recognized.  The  Government  must  provide \ncertification that unexploded ordnance has been cleared before it submits an IEE \nto  ADB  for  approval\u2014or,  if  an  IEE  has  already  been  approved,  before \ncommencement of civil works. \n \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that all LARPs are approved by ADB prior to the \naward of civil works contracts for clusters of subprojects, in accordance with the \nLARF  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations, and procedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements as defined in ADB\u2019s Policy ", "20  \non Involuntary Resettlement. In case of discrepancies between Government\u2019s \nlaws, regulations, and procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, the latter will apply. \n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  promote  the  full  participation  of  ethnic  minorities  and \nindigenous  peoples  in  project  activities,  including,  among  other  things, \ndeveloping mechanisms to include them in capacity building and training under \nthe Project. The Government will ensure that all activities are consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  and  that  participation  in  the  Project  is \nappropriately  adapted  to  meet  the  particular  needs  of  areas  with  a  high \nproportion of ethnic minority people. The WSUG board will be representative of \nethnic composition of the WSUG. \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n64.  The following are conditions for grant effectiveness: \n \n(i)  MRD will have revised the Guidelines on the Establishment of WSUG (dated 21 \nAugust  2004)  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  organization  and  registration, \nstatutes, rights and responsibilities of a WSUG and its members, and the election \nand composition of WSUGs board, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \n(ii)  Each PIU will have established procurement committees and an NGO selection \ncommittee in accordance with Government regulations. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n65.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $18 million equivalent to the Government of Cambodia for the \nTonle  Sap  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nGrant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJoseph Eichenberger \nVice President \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 September 2005  \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  21\nRURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Sector Profile \n \n1.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage. Despite increased access to services, \nCambodia has one of the lowest rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) service levels in \nSoutheast Asia. Access to safe water in rural areas stands at 31.7%, and access to sanitation at \n12.5%,  according  to  the  Sector  Investment  Plan  20051  (Table  1).  In  the  five  provinces \nparticipating in the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project)\u2014\nBattambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap\u2014the rate of access \nto safe water is 20.0% and to sanitation is 9.6%. The safe water indicators are the use of \nprotected  water  sources  (protected  wells,  tube  wells,  or  piped  water  systems),  and  the \nsanitation indicators refer to the use of household latrines. The present coverage data vary \ngreatly  according  to  the  source2.  As  a  result,  the  estimates  of  access  to  safe  water  and \nsanitation may be overoptimistic, and the actual sustained coverage is probably lower.  \n \nTable A1.1: Rural Water and Sanitation Coverage in Cambodian Provinces \n(%) \n \n  Rural Households with Access  Rural Households with \nArea Name  to Safe Drinking Water  Access to Sanitation \nBanteay Meanchey  15.0  15.0 \nBattambang  15.0  15.0 \nKampong Cham  25.0  12.0 \nKampong Chhnang  21.0  5.0 \nKampong Speu  30.0  6.0 \nKampong Thom  17.0  12.5 \nKampot  24.5  6.5 \nKandal  35.0  9.5 \nKoh Kong  45.0  12.0 \nKratie  25.0  20.5 \nMondul Kiri  24.0  4.0 \nOddar Meanchey  37.0  3.0 \nPhnom Penh rural  70.0  53.0 \nPreah Vihear  32.0  3.0 \nPrey Veng  60.0  8.0 \nPursat  10.0  5.5 \nRatanak Kiri  38.0  2.5 \nSiemreap  33.0  6.0 \nStung Treng  30.0  30.0 \nSvay Rieng  60.0  18.0 \nTakeo  28.0  15.0 \nAverage for Cambodia  31.7  12.5 \nSource: Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). 2005.

In rural areas, water comes mostly from community wells and tube wells, \nas well as from family systems (shallow wells and rainwater collected in small jars). Since 1989, \nconsiderable financial and technical efforts have been made in the sector to increase the \n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Rural Development. 2005.

However, many of these wells do not function because of \nmaintenance problems arising from the weaknesses of the community management systems \nand the lack of spare parts. The need exists to introduce stronger mechanisms for maintenance, \nencourage  the  participation  of  the  private  sector,  intensify  contributions  to  operation  and \nmaintenance, and develop a spare-parts network on a market basis. \n \n3.  Sanitation. Latrine use is uncommon in most rural areas of Cambodia. The high cost of \nlatrines ($50 for the most common pour-flush latrine) and the lack of information and awareness \non water use and hygiene are the major obstacles to the dissemination of latrines in rural areas. \nSanitation facilities are generally considered a lower priority than water supply systems. For this \nreason, the Department of Rural Health Care (DRHC) of MRD and several agencies, such as \nthe  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  have  recently  focused  on  education  and \nawareness to stimulate demand for adequate sanitation facilities. \n \n4.  Health and Hygiene Education. Most rural Cambodians are unaware of the adverse \nhealth effects of unsafe water use and the lack of hygiene. They continue to drink untreated \nsurface water, prefer to defecate in the open, and rarely wash their hands (less than half use \nsoap  in  the  project  provinces).  DRHC  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have \ndeveloped  several  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC)  materials,  but  financial \nsupport has been insufficient to organize comprehensive countrywide education campaigns. \n \n5.  Government  Goals.  In  line  with  the  Cambodia  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(CMDGs),3 the primary objective of the Government is to improve the well-being of people \nthroughout the country, with a focus on the rural areas home to 85% of the population. The \nGovernment has developed the national water supply and sanitation policy (NWSSP), which \nhas established the objective that \u201cevery person in rural communities has sustained access to \nsafe water supply and sanitation services and [is] living in a hygienic environment by 2025\u201d and \nis committed to expanding improved water supply coverage from 24% in 1998 to 50% in 2015, \nand sanitation coverage from 8.6% in 1998 to 30.0% in 2015, according to the RWSS Sector \nInvestment Plan 2005\u20132015. \n \nB.  Sector Institutions  \n \n6.  Agencies  Involved  in  Rural  Water  Supply.  Several  government  agencies  are \nresponsible for the provision, management, and regulation of water. The overall water sector is \ndivided into different areas, with a lead agency generally responsible for each. The Sector \nCoordinating Committee for the Development of Water Supply and Sanitation is chaired by the \nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME). The Committee includes 11 other institutions, \nnamely (i) MRD (vice chair), (ii) Ministry of Public Works and Transport (vice chair), (iii) Ministry \nof Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM), (iv) Ministry of Health (MOH), (v) Ministry of \nEnvironment, (vi) Council of Ministers, (vii) Council for the Development of Cambodia, (viii) \nMinistry of Economy and Finance, (ix) Ministry of Agriculture, (x) Phnom Penh Water Supply \nAuthority, and (xi) Ministry of Planning. \n \n7.  Central Government Agencies. The various government ministries and agencies with \nwater sector-related responsibilities are MRD, MOWRAM, MIME, and to a lesser extent MOH. \nMOWRAM has overall responsibility for water resource planning and management. MRD is \nspecifically responsible for RWSS. MIME is in charge of water supplies to provincial and small \ntowns, as well as the regulation of the private sector involved in piped water systems. Although \n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Planning. 2003. Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (targets 7.10 and 7.12). Phnom Penh. ", "  Appendix 1  23\nthe mandate of each ministry is fairly clear, there remains an overlap in responsibilities on the \nground that can be subjected to ad hoc agreements between the concerned ministries. For \nexample, community-owned small-scale piped water systems remain in the scope of MRD, but \nMIME has responsibility for privately owned piped water systems regardless of location, based \non an agreement between MRD and MIME signed in February 2005. MOH is responsible for the \nquality of public water supply sources, while MIME has set the drinking water quality standards. \n \n8.  Inter-ministerial relationships remain weak, partly due to the requirement that staff follow \nwell-established vertical lines of communication. Exchange of data or information is slow and \noften limited. Although MOWRAM and MRD have shared a groundwater database since 1994, \nand MRD keeps a separate record of wells installed with the support of UNICEF and other \nagencies, these records are incomplete. All existing data need to be verified and updated. The \ninformation is inadequate for managing the RWSS sector because of the short periods of \nobservation, insufficient monitoring sites, or lost records. This weakness is recognized by the \nGovernment, and steps are being taken to reestablish national capacity to acquire and manage \ndata and information related to RWSS and the environment. \n \n9.  Ministry of Rural Development. MRD was established in 1994 with staff originating in \nother ministries (the water supply and sanitation department come from MOH). The role of MRD \nnationally is to plan and coordinate assistance to the RWSS sector, though it still carries out \nsome well drilling and installation. Within MRD, responsibilities for RWSS are shared between \nthe Department of Rural Water Supply and DRHC, which is responsible for sanitation and health \neducation. While these departments have gained some knowledge of rural development by \nworking on projects with NGOs and bilateral development agencies over the years, they still \nneed considerable capacity building and assistance, especially provincially. MRD, like other \ngovernment agencies, has traditionally been an implementer, with operational drilling teams and \nequipment. Following the new NWSSP signed in February 2003, the ministry is increasingly \ntaking on policy, planning and regulatory functions, while construction, supervision, and service \nprovision are gradually being taken over by private enterprises. \n \n10.  Provincial Structures. MRD implements projects either through provincial departments \nof rural development (PDRDs) or provincial rural development committees (PRDCs). PDRDs \nare deconcentrated provincial agencies of MRD that implement projects in direct collaboration \nwith commune councils and village development committees (VDCs) where they exist. PDRDs \nhave six sections, namely: (i) rural water supply, (ii) rural health care, (iii) rural credit, (iv) rural \nroads, (v) rural community development, and (vi) administration and finances. They have 40\u201380 \nstaff members, depending on the importance of the province, of whom many are attached to \nprojects  or  NGOs  when  not  on  leave  for  private  sector  activities.  PRDCs,  chaired  by  the \ngovernor and constituted by representatives of seven provincial line agencies (health, women\u2019s \naffairs,  rural  development,  agriculture,  water  resources,  planning,  and  interior),  bear \nresponsibility for coordinating development initiatives through the formulation of the provincial \nstrategic  development  plan  and  the  provincial  investment  plan.  As  such,  all  qualifying \ninvestments are referred to PRDCs to ensure compliance with provincial plans. The PDRD \ndirector is vice chair of the PRDC. The executive committee of the PRDC is in charge of PRDC \noperational activities. \n \n11.  District Structures. The district office of rural development, which is part of MRD, \nperforms PDRD functions in districts. The office is underutilized, however, as projects generally \nintervene directly with the commune councils, village chiefs, and VDCs. \n ", "24   Appendix 1 \n12.  Commune Councils. The election of commune councils in 2002 gave them greater \nresponsibilities regarding the planning, implementation, and financing of rural infrastructure. \nEvery  year,  commune  councils  plan  and  formulate  their  needs  and  submit  them  to  the \nGovernment and donors. The Government gives each commune council $6,000\u2013$10,000 per \nyear for district workshops and rural projects. However, the analysis of commune plans shows \nthat RWSS receives less consideration than other infrastructure such as roads. \n \n13.  Villages  Structures.  The  village  institutional  framework  remains  generally  weak. \nCommittee members of the village development committees are volunteers who were not part of \nthe Government structure. In the commune planning process, the identification and planning of \nprojects  are  now  the  responsibility  of  planning  and  budgeting  committees,  which  include \ncommune council members and two representatives from each village, one male and one \nfemale. \n \n14.  Water and Sanitation Users Groups. In line with the NWSSP, responsibility for RWSS \nlies with water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs), which have the authority to perform \nmanagerial tasks and carry out the operation and maintenance of the systems. MRD has issued \nguidelines for establishing WSUGs. The ownership of systems, agreements with the private \nsector, and legal aspects regarding the user service remain the responsibility of communes. \n \n15.  Local NGOs and Entrepreneurs. Local NGOs and entrepreneurs are becoming more \nactively involved in the provision of RWSS services. However, capacity in this area is limited as \nthe business environment essential to successful large-scale involvement remains hampered by \na  lack  of  business  services  or  affordable  credit,  and  by  unclear  regulations  regarding  the \nparticipation of the private sector in infrastructure development. MRD realizes that engaging \nlocal NGOs and the private sector in the provision of services is needed if sector targets are to \nbe met, and it is including provision in sector plans and strategies for this eventuality.  \n \n16.  Coordination in the Sector on Technical Issues. The RWSS sector working group, \nchaired by the director of DRWS, includes NGOs and meets every month to discuss RWSS \ntechnical issues. The water use and health education forum is an annual event organized \nnationally by DRHC to disseminate information and share the experiences of sector initiatives. \nHowever,  no  entity  currently  exists  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  policy  and  the \npreparation of the strategy and guidelines. \n \n17.  The Institutional Development Plan. The Institutional Development Plan for the RWSS \nSector (2003\u20132007) prepared by MRD stresses that a major retraining and recruitment will be \nneeded for MRD and PDRDs. Retraining will be based on a needs assessment indicating \nrequired competencies for jobs in rural development, especially RWSS. The needs assessment \nwill also suggest the optimal way to achieve the required competency. Capacity building within \nall levels of MRD will aim to strengthen MRD and PDRDs and enable them to make the \ntransition from their traditional role of implementer to that of facilitator. Their emerging role will \nrequire them to be able to collaborate with other partners that enjoy comparative advantages, \nsuch  as  the  private  sector,  whose  advantage  is  in  the  technical area,  and NGOs,  whose \nadvantage is in community mobilization.  \n \nC.  Sector Policies, Strategies, and Plans \n \n18.  RWSS in the Overall Government Policy:  RWSS has been an integral part of the \nGovernment\u2019s overall strategy for rural development and poverty reduction. The Rectangular ", "  Appendix 1  25\nStrategy4 states that \u201cthe Royal Government of Cambodia will focus on providing all citizens with \nclean and safe water, protecting all citizens from water related diseases, providing adequate \nwater supply to ensure food security economic activities and appropriate living standards.\u201d The \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy5  states  that  \u201cRWSS  is  a  key  effort  of  the  Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia policy aimed at poverty reduction,\u201d and the Cambodian Millennium \nDevelopment Goals note that \u201cincreasing the proportion of rural population with access to safe \nwater to 50% in 2015, and access to sanitation to 30% in 2015, place [a] high priority on \nRWSS.\u201d \n \n19.  The Sector Policy. The National Water and Sanitation Policy prepared jointly by MIME \nand MRD in February 2003 states that every rural Cambodian should have access to safe water \nand sanitation in 2025 and insists on three major aspects:  \n \n  (i)  the role of the ministries as regulatory and monitoring agencies as opposed to \ntheir previous role in direct implementation;  \n \n(ii)  the provision of RWSS services based on user demand, a process that includes \n\u201cvoice and choice\u201d in technology selection and the willingness of the users to \nshare the related cost; and  \n \n  (iii)  the importance of private sector participation.  \n \n20.  The policy recognizes the importance of four major guiding principles: (i) the social and \neconomic value of water, (ii) the promotion of safe behaviour, (iii) the importance of sustainable \nmanagement  of  rural  water  resources,  and  (iv)  community  participation  and  local  decision \nmaking. \n \n21.  Strategy and Guidelines. Following the approval of the policy, MRD has initiated the \nprocess  of  developing  and  adapting  guidelines,  especially  regarding  informed  choice  and \nprivate sector participation. However, MRD has not yet developed an overall RWSS strategy to \nimplement the policy, and only a few guidelines have been developed. Several implementation \nmanuals have been prepared to classify and guide RWSS contractors with the support of \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (the French Development Agency). Guidelines regarding \nthe establishment of water user groups were prepared by MRD in 2004, but they must be \nimproved to clarify the roles and responsibilities of WSUGs. The Water and Sanitation Program \nand UNICEF have provided regular support to MRD regarding sanitation guidelines. \n \n22.  RWSS  Investment  Plan:  2005\u20132015.  MRD  approved  a  sector  investment  plan  in \nJanuary 2005. The plan describes overall sector financing requirements and expected levels of \ncoverage based on the CMDGs: 50% of rural population with access to safe water, and 30% \nwith  access  to  improved  sanitation,  by  2015  (present  levels,  based  on  the  Inter-Censal \nPopulation  Survey  2004,  are  31.7%  with  access  to  safe  water  and  12.5%  with  sanitation \ncoverage). Resources equivalent to $116 million in capital investment costs and $4.8 million of \nrecurrent costs will be needed to reach the objectives by 2015. Communities are expected to \ncontribute 33% (covering the maintenance cost of water facilities, and total investment and \nmaintenance costs of sanitation), government 9%, and external assistance 58%. \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004.

Promote the construction of water points on private land owned by a member of the \nwater  and  sanitation  user  group  (WSUG).  Community-based  systems  will  not  necessarily \nensure sustainability unless the incentives are properly addressed in the project design and \nimplementation. The impact assessment1 of a rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) project, \ncarried out in 130 selected villages in the poorest areas of six provinces of Cambodia, found \nthat water supply systems solely managed by a community structure failed shortly after their \nconstruction.  Except  where  there  are  active  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  rural \nCambodians rarely act as communities. The above survey also found that the externally driven \ncommunity-based organizations, such as water point committees created to manage the hand \npumps, failed to perform their management functions effectively, despite a strong capacity-\nbuilding process in the program, when the water points were placed on public land. In contrast, \nthe community systems constructed on private land or managed by a member of the community \nwith a direct personal interest in the management of the system is better maintained and, in \nmost cases, accessible by all.  \n \n2.  Include a wide range of simple technology options for open choice by communities and \nhouseholds. As most wells will be maintained by local people, technologies recommended for \nthe systems should be locally appropriate. Direct access and easy availability of spare parts at \naffordable prices should be guaranteed. In certain areas where sparse coverage is due to the \nlack  of  suitable  options  or  equipment,  it  is  necessary  to  test  new  solutions  and  prepare \npackages of civil works contracts that allow the private sector to buy adequate equipment. The \nchoice of options, especially for deep pumps, should be open, and people should decide the \ntype of equipment they are ready to pay for. Type of deep pumps that were promoted in \nCambodia,  with  the  aim  of  facilitating  maintenance,  has  had  its  limitations  and  has  not \ngenerated the expected countrywide deep-pump spare-part network. The Project will offer a \nrange options with different costs, and water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) will choose. \n \n3.  Encourage  private  sector  participation  in  the  management  of  piped  water  systems. \nWhereas rural communities have difficulties managing community infrastructure and collecting \nlocal contributions, rural Cambodians are well disposed toward private sector participation. \nThere are many successful private sector initiatives in rural water supply (private vendors, small \npiped water systems). In the case of rural piped water systems managed by the private sector,2 \nsatisfaction and payment rates are excellent, respectively 85% and 99%. The assistance of \nprivate sector in managing community water infrastructure offers a chance to increase the \nsustainability of water systems, with appropriate conditions guaranteeing access for the poorest \nresidents. The Project will provide training to private sector operators and develop a database of \ncompanies to facilitate private sector participation. \n \n4.  Stress the importance of operation and maintenance (O&M) of RWSS facilities. Projects \nand NGOs have provided free water equipment without any consideration for the necessity of \ncovering the cost of O&M, even when people were willing and able to pay. Water infrastructure \nwill be sustainable only if rural people pay for O&M, with access conditional upon effective \npayment, except for the very poor. The Project will include an awareness campaign on the \neconomic value of water and encourage WSUGs to take full financial responsibility for the O&M \nof water supply systems. \n                                                           \n1  Kosan Engineering. 2001.

Integrate water, sanitation, and hygiene education in RWSS projects. In many cases, \nimproving community water supply does not result in full economic and health benefits due to a \nlack of attention to hygiene education and sanitation. The very low level of sanitation awareness \nin rural Cambodia hinders the development of good sanitation practices and the improvement of \npublic and household sanitation infrastructure. In rural areas, few people are aware of the \nrelationship  between  good  sanitation  practices  and  improved  health.  Very  few  people  use \nlatrines, regularly clean water jars, boil drinking water, or use soap when washing their hands. \nThe Project will implement a national campaign that aims to change hygiene behavior with \npractical information and demonstrations. The Project will include a comprehensive sanitation \nawareness  campaign  in  the  participating  provinces,  to  take  place  before  or  during  the \ndevelopment of sanitation infrastructure. \n \n6.  Encourage the deconcentration and decentralization of decision making. International \nexperience shows that planning and managing RWSS is better done by local authorities and \ncommunities, with the central Government taking the role or regulator and policy developer. The \nProject  will  promote  the  current  decentralization  process,  which  gives  more  power  to  the \ncommunes to decide their priorities and enter into contracts directly with NGOs and the private \nsector.  The  selection  of  projects  will  be  done,  in  principle,  through  the  current  commune \nplanning  process.  The  Project  will  also  promote  deconcentration  from  the  center  to  the \nprovinces. Planning and supervision of project implementation will be done provincially.  \n \n7.  Place  the  community  at  the  forefront  of  decision  making  and  management  and \nencourage community contributions. The participation of communities is a key condition for \nsustainable RWSS systems. The Project will place villages and commune councils at the center \nof the decision-making process regarding the selection, preparation, and implementation of \nsubprojects. The Project will help villages and commune councils understand and actively \nparticipate in all the phases of the project cycle. WSUGs will contribute 10% of the capital cost \nof water supply infrastructure and about 50% of the capital cost of sanitation facilities. Villages \nand communes will prepare and approve village water and sanitation plans with the assistance \nof NGOs. To improve the transparency of the process, special procedures will be put in place to \nreceive and deal with complaints from local individuals openly and fairly. \n \n8.  Recognize women as the primary users of water, hygiene educators, and managers of \nRWSS  systems,  and  involve  women  in  their  development  and  O&M.  Although  women\u2019s \npriorities are often tied to the provision of water supply and private latrines, their formal role in \nRWSS  remains  limited.  The  Project  will  mainstream  gender  at  the  institutional  level  and \nenhance women\u2019s role in daily decision making and technical skills development. It will build the \ncapacity of the gender working group within the Ministry of Rural Development by developing \nnational guidelines for gender mainstreaming in RWSS. The Project will encourage the equal \nparticipation and representation of women in formal decision-making units at all administrative \nlevels. As discussions with school officials reveal that girls, especially adolescent girls, are often \nshy to use the same block of latrine facilities as boys, the Project will construct and locate \nseparate school latrines that are clearly marked for girls.  \n \n9.  Develop partnerships and information sharing among all stakeholders to benefit the \nRWSS sector. Several pilot projects involving local partnerships between communes, NGOs, \nand  the  private  sector  have  improved  RWSS  sustainability.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \nPoverty reduction is the Government\u2019s principal objective and primary development goal, as defined in the Second \nEconomic  Development  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  (SEDP  II),  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (2003\u20132005) \n(NPRS), and the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency (2004\u20132008) (Rectangular \nStrategy). The SEDP II and the NPRS introduced new approaches to development planning, including open and \nextensive participation by stakeholders. By implementing the SEDP II and the NPRS, the Rectangular Strategy \nfocuses on promoting economic growth through agriculture, infrastructure, private sector growth and employment, \nand human resource development. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) overarching goal for Cambodia, as \ndefined in its Country Strategy and Programa, is sustainable poverty reduction. The CSP is in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and  focuses  on  (i)  broad-based  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment,  and (iii) good governance. Provision of rural  water supply  and sanitation (RWSS) facilities  is \nhighlighted as a means by which inclusive social development can be achieved. The CSP also stresses four \ncrosscutting themes\u2014governance, private sector development, gender, and the environment\u2014that help support the \npoverty reduction objectives of the Rectangular Strategy. The Project will support the development of RWSS in five \nprovinces around the Tonle Sap basin: Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, and Siem Reap. b The \ngeographical focus is consistent with the CSP and the Tonle Sap Initiative (2005). The Project will also contribute to \nthe achievement of the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs) to provide, by 2015, access to safe \nwater to 50% of rural residents and access to sanitation facilities to 30% of rural residents.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nCambodia had a total population of 13 million in 2004, with an annual population growth rate of 1.8%. The country\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 5.2% in 2003, with a GDP per capita of $296. The highest \ngrowth was seen in agriculture. About 84% of the population resides in rural areas, with a population density of 268 \npersons per km2 of arable land. The Tonle Sap basin covers about 44% of Cambodia's total area and has about one \nthird of the country\u2019s total population. During 1993\u20131999, Cambodia experienced a slight reduction in poverty from \n39% to 36%. c  The poverty rate is estimated at 29.7% in urban areas and at 40.1% in rural areas. Rural households \n(i.e., those whose primary source of income is agriculture) account for almost 90% of the total poor. The net primary \nschool enrollment rate increased from 76% in 1997 to 91% in 2003. Under-5 child mortality remained at 120 per \n1,000 live births. From 1995 to 2000, maternal mortality fell from 590 to 437 per 100,000 live births. \n \nCambodia has one of the lowest levels of water and sanitation coverage in southeast Asia. According to the RWSS \nSector Investment Plan (SIP, 2005\u20132015), an estimated 31.7% of the rural population has access to safe water, and \n12.5% to sanitation. The development of RWSS improves the health of the rural people by reducing the incidence of \nwater-related diseases and the associated costs of health care and treatment. RWSS contributes to the economic \nproductivity of men and women, especially in terms of time savings, and it reduces burden of labor. It also provides \nopportunities for private sector participation in the development of rural infrastructure and generates employment in \nrural communities for construction, operation and maintenance. \n \nThe Project is expected to meet the CMDGs in the five provinces by providing, by 2011, safe water to 1.09 million \nrural people and latrine access to 0.72 million rural people. The current rural population in the five provinces is \nestimated to be 2.96 million in 2005 and expected to reach 3.36 million by 2011. The Project will rehabilitate and \nupgrade existing water supply and sanitation infrastructure and provide capital for new community and household \ninfrastructure. Family water supply systems will be provided when community options are not possible. Project \ncomponents include (i) community mobilization and skills development, (ii) development of water supply systems; \n(iii) development of sanitation facilities; and (iv) capacity building and implementation support. The water use and \nhygiene education program will learn from past campaigns and coordinate with ongoing efforts.  \n \nThe five provinces were selected on the basis of their low RWSS coverage, high poverty rate, and population size, \nas well as a regional focus. The poor are targeted in three ways: (i) at the macro level, provinces have been \nselected based on high poverty incidence; (ii) at the meso level, the subproject pre-selection criteria will give priority \nto villages found in the poorest 20% of communes in each province; and (iii) at the micro level, villagers will identify \nthe poorest 20% of residents during the preparation of their village water supply and sanitation plans, with that \nidentification verified by the village chief, commune council, and participating NGOs. The Project will ensure that the \npoorest households are exempt from cash contribution while participating in a water and sanitation user group \n(WSUG) or receiving a household solution. All households will be able to select an effective sanitation option that \nthey can afford, as sanitation options are subsidized based on technology. \n \n ", "                    Appendix 5    33\n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted for the Project to help identify the key project stakeholders and their \ninterests. Primary stakeholders include rural residents, resettlement-affected people, the poorest people  and \nvulnerable groups, water and sanitation users, village authorities, planning and budgeting committees, commune \ncouncils,  the  private  sector,  gender  working  groups,  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  at  all \nadministrative levels. Secondary stakeholders include provincial rural development committees, the Inter-Ministerial \nResettlement Committee, mass organizations, and relevant line agencies. The analysis was helpful in conducting \nstakeholder consultations during project preparation. \n \nThe Project was developed through public consultations, workshops, and meetings with different stakeholders. \nDuring project design, community meetings were held with potential beneficiaries to discuss water supply and \nsanitation issues, poverty levels, beneficiary contribution and affordability issues, land acquisition and environmental \nconcerns, hygiene practices, and operation and maintenance challenges. To complement the findings from surveys \ncompleted  in  Kampong  Thom  and  Pursat  in  2002,  additional  socioeconomic  surveys  were  conducted  in \nBattambang, Kampong Chhnang, and Siem Reap provinces. Household information and individual views were \ngathered on current water and sanitation situations and future preferences. Participatory rapid appraisal was used to \ncapture community attitudes and perceptions of water use and hygiene education. Consultations were also held with \nhouseholds that  were  poor, ethnically  diverse, vulnerable, and headed by females. Consultations helped  in \ndesigning the component on community mobilization and skills development. Discussions and surveys also helped \ndetermine how much beneficiaries can afford to contribute to RWSS infrastructure. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project supports community-based public services that will enable greater village participation in planning to \nbetter respond to local needs. A participation strategy has been incorporated into the community mobilization and \nskills development component to help build community ownership of water supply systems and sanitation options. \nThe component takes into consideration different levels of cooperation and collaboration among stakeholders in \ndeveloping village water supply and sanitation plans. For instance, a rapid appraisal will be conducted to identify (i) \nvillage water and sanitation needs; (ii) poor, ethnic, and vulnerable households; (iii) water supply and sanitation \ncoverage  and  access;  and  (iv)  water  and  sanitation-related  illness.  Steps  for  stakeholder  participation  and \nconsultation have also been integrated into other project components and individual social plans. Appendix 16 \ndescribes the different levels of beneficiary contributions.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAbout 52% of the total population in the five provinces is female, with a male\u2013female ratio of 94:100 in 2005. The \npercentage of female-headed households (FHHs) in Cambodia was 29% in 2004, an increase from 26% in 1998. In \nthe five provinces, the percentage of FHHs was about 27%--higher than the national average of about 26% in 1998. \nWomen in Cambodia play important roles in the RWSS sector. In households, they are responsible for a variety of \ntasks related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (e.g., collection of water). Within MRD, a gender working group has \nbeen established to oversee the mainstreaming of gender into rural development activities. A gender analysis was \nconducted for the project to determine the water use and hygiene education needs of both men and women. Unsafe \nwater heavily infused with iron or calcium may harm the health of women (e.g., with reproductive tract infections). \nMost participants of hygiene education programs are women. Efforts to increase male participation are needed. It \nwas suggested that public school latrine facilities be constructed and located separately for girls. This would help \nincrease latrine access and privacy for girls at schools, while positively influencing their enrollment rates. A gender \nanalysis and action plan has been prepared for the Project (see Appendix 6).  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \n \nE.

A  sample  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan has not been prepared as the location of \nthese water supply systems and sanitation options is unknown. \nIssues pertaining to affordability are not expected to arise. The \nProject has prepared standard design options with associated \ncost  estimates,  including  contribution  levels.  Water  user \nhouseholds will contribute 10% (3% cash and 7% in-kind) for a \n Significant  selected  water supply system and about 50% (in-kind) for \n Yes \nAffordability   Not significant  sanitation options, depending on the latrine type selected and \n  No \n None  household affordability. Through informed choice, communities \nwill learn about the different options and select water supply \nsystem and sanitation options that they can afford. Additional \nsafeguards are in place to ensure equal access to the poor, \nethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups.  \nLabor is not a potential issue. The Project helps to generate \nlocal  employment  opportunities  during  the  construction, \noperation,  and  maintenance  of  project  components. \nCommunities  will  be  informed  of  potential  livelihood \nopportunities  resulting  from  direct  access  to  water  and \n Significant \nimproved sanitation (e.g., homestead gardening). Women, the   Yes \nLabor   Not significant \npoor,  and  ethnic  minorities  will  have  equal  access  to    No  \n None \nemployment opportunities. In particular, the poor and women \nwill be eligible for special training in water and sanitation-\nrelated jobs created by the Project (e.g., technical skills training \nand operation and maintenance). The private sector will use \nlocal labor during civil works construction. \nEthnic minority groups in the Project area include the Cham, \nChinese,  Thai,  and  Vietnamese.  A  few  households  of \nindigenous  Chorng,  Khuy,  and  Por  were  found  in  Pursat \nProvince during the socioeconomic survey. The Project will \nbenefit all ethnic minority groups and indigenous households \nequally. Specific actions that have been incorporated into the \nproject design include (i) subproject selection criteria that give \n Significant \nIndigenous  consideration to ethnic balance in the selection of subproject   Yes \n Not significant \nPeoples  villages,  (ii)  village  mapping  that  identifies  where  different    No  \n None \nethnic groups live, (iii) WSUG boards that are representative of \nethnic composition of its WSUG members; (iv) water use and \nhygiene  education  incorporating  the  water  and  sanitation \nneeds of different ethnic groups, and (v) issues of ethnicity in \nRWSS incorporated in the guidelines. Water supply systems \nand  sanitation  options  will  not  discriminate  against  any \ncommunities or household due to ethnicity.  \nThe increased risk to HIV/AIDS due to the Project is minimal. \nTo  keep  risks  low,  the  Department  of  Rural  Health  Care \nOther Risks   Significant  (DRHC) within MRD will integrate HIV/AIDS awareness into its \n Yes \nand/or   Not significant  health and hygiene programs.

The Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project) provides \nsignificant  benefits  to  rural  residents  in  the  five  Cambodian  provinces  of  Battambang, \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. The Project is expected to \nprovide, by 2001, safe water to 1.09 million rural people and latrine access to 0.72 million rural \npeople. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to highlight the different rural water \nsupply and sanitation (RWSS) needs of men and women in Cambodia. It also helps to ensure \nthat both men and women have equal opportunities for employment and to participate in \ntraining at all levels. The GAP is based on gender analysis prepared for the Project, and is \ndesigned according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  Females make up 51.5% of the total population in the project area. About 85% of the \ntotal population resides in rural areas. The male:female ratio is estimated at 94:100 in 2005. \nLife expectancy in the project provinces is 62 years for women and 56 years for men, both \nfigures  lower  than  the  national  average  of  64  for  women  and  58  for  men.  In  1998,  the \npercentage of female-headed households (FHHs) was higher in four of the project area\u2019s five \nprovinces than the national average of about 26%, ranging from 27% in Kampong Chhnang to \n29% in Battambang. Pursat was the exception with 24%. Categories of FHHs often identified \nby commune council leaders include those headed by (i) widows, (ii) divorcees, (iii) women \nwhose  husbands  do  not  contribute  to  household  management;  and  (iv)  women  whose \nhusbands are absent migrant workers. The high percentage of widows is a consequence of \nCambodia\u2019s historical political conflict.  Most female household heads are aged 40 and older.  \n \n3.  Gender analysis is intricately linked with issues of ethnicity and poverty. The Khmer \nmajority has a matrifocal bias, in which (i) newly married couples live in the brides\u2019 households \nduring the first few years and (ii) daughters inherit household assets, including land, on equal \nterms as sons. Age plays an important role in that the youngest offspring often receives more \nproperty than older children. However, women customarily cede the responsibility of signing \ndocuments and title papers to men because these are public and official functions. The Cham \nminority follow Muslim norms where inheritance is divided 2:1 in favor of sons over daughters. \nThe Vietnamese follow a custom that provides equal inheritance for both sons and daughters. \nThe Chinese generally practice a patrifocal system, where brides live with their in-laws.  \n \nB.  Gender Water Use and Hygiene Behavior \n \n4.  Men and women are responsible for different types of work that define their social roles. \nWomen engage in productive work, household activities, and family care. Demands on their \ntime and a lack of access to resources hinders their ability to participate in household and \ncommunity decisions. Women\u2019s priorities are often associated with the provision of water and \nprivate latrines. The socioeconomic surveys found 75% of respondents reported that the \nburden of collecting water falls on women and children. Findings revealed that men and boys \nalso collect water, especially during the dry season when water sources are remote. Limited \naccess to potable water in the dry season significantly affects the living conditions of poor \nhouseholds and FHHs. Discussions with women in Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Thom \nindicated that, in the dry season, women and children spend up to 3 hours per day collecting \nwater due to the remoteness of the source, the need for frequent trips, or long queues at water ", " 36  Appendix 6 \npoints. The socioeconomic survey found that 35% of households have to fetch water from \nsources more than 100 meters away. \n \n5.  Men  and  women  also  engage  in  different  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices.  The \nsocioeconomic surveys found that 65\u201375% of respondents said women are responsible for \nproper hygiene and for cleaning water jars and around the well area. Unsafe water with high \nconcentrations of iron or calcium harm women\u2019s health (e.g., by causing reproductive tract \ninfections). Most participants in hygiene education programs are women. Efforts to increase \nmale participation in hygiene education are needed. Ethnic groups have particular practices \nthat have water use and hygiene implications. For instance, the Cham wash before praying \nfive times per day. Some claim to use up to 100 liters of water per day for this purpose. \n \n6.  School  hygiene  education  programs  are  important  for  long-term  improvement  in \nsanitation practices. School is a critical entry point for targeting children\u2019s hygiene behavior. \nChildren are able to learn and transfer best hygienic practices to other children and relatives. \nDiscussions with school officials in Kampong Chhnang revealed that girls are often shy to use \nthe same block of toilets as boys. It was suggested that public school latrines be constructed \nand located separately for girls. This would help increase access to latrines and improve \nprivacy for girls, thereby positively influencing their enrollment rates. \n \nC.  Representation in Public Institutions \n \n7.  Gender disparities in leadership exist at all levels of the government. Women tend to \nbe excluded from the decision-making process in the administrative and institutional system. \nProvincial government departments have few female staff members, and even fewer females \nin managerial positions, with the exception of the provincial departments of women\u2019s affairs. A \nlack of female leaders is a consequence of low education, obsolete recruitment and promotion \nprocedures, and poor understanding of women\u2019s potential. However, the need for gender \nmainstreaming is being realized at all levels. Within the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), \na gender working group (GWG) of three women and four men has been established to \noversee the mainstreaming of gender into rural development activities.  \n \n8.  MRD administers about 8,000 village development committees (VDCs) in the country \nas part of the rural development structure. At least 40% of VDC members are female. Less \nthan 10% of village chiefs are women. The VDCs have several subcommittees on specific \ntasks (e.g., planning, health, water, and law and order), and women\u2019s participation is more \nvisible in subcommittees such as health. Women\u2019s groups exist in some villages, especially \nwhere the nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have made inroads. They are mainly self-\nhelp and microfinance groups, such as the traditional savings and credit groups (tontin).  \n \n9.  The lowest level of elected governance is the commune council, which has 5 to 11 \nelected  members,  depending  on  the  commune  size.  There  is  no  quota  for  women\u2019s \nparticipation, as members are voted into office. Women are nominated to become members of \ndifferent  subcommittees  within  the  councils  (e.g.,  health).  The  commune  budgeting  and \nplanning committee includes two representatives from each village, one of whom is a woman.  \n \nD.

The project management unit (PMU) will include information about GAP \nactivities in quarterly progress reports prepared and submitted to ADB and the Government.  ", "Appendix 7    39\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  The  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (the  Project)  in \nCambodia has four components: (i) community mobilization and skills development, (ii) water \nsupply improvement, (iii) sanitation improvement, and (iv) capacity building and institutional \nsupport. The purpose of the Project is to improve access to safe water and sanitation for the \nrural population of the five provinces of Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, \nPursat, and Siem Reap. The Project specifically aims to achieve the Cambodian Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (CMDGs) in the target areas by its completion in 2011, by which time 50% \nof  rural  residents  shall  have  access  to  safe  water  and  30%  shall  have  access  to  proper \nsanitation.  \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n2.  The scope of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) for the Project is not significant.1 \nCommunity wells and household latrines will be built on private land, making land acquisition \nunnecessary. However, very minor land acquisition may be required for bigger water supply \nsystems (e.g., ponds and small piped water systems) and public latrines. No person will be \nphysically  relocated  from  their  place  of  residence  or  severely  affected  by  any  subproject \nfinanced under the Project. Past experience with rural water supply and sanitation projects \nsuggest that subprojects can be designed without severely affecting people or households. A \nland acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) has been prepared for the sector project \naccording to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nGovernment of Cambodia laws and regulations (Supplementary Appendix A). A sample land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has not been prepared as the location of these water \nsupply systems and sanitation options is unknown.  \n \nB.  Legal Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements \n \n3.  The LARF and compensation entitlements have been built upon (i) the laws of the \nGovernment, principally the Constitution (1993) and the Land Law (2001), and a number of \nother laws, regulations, and decrees relevant to land acquisition and resettlement; (ii) ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995); and (iii) Government-approved resettlement plans \nfor other ADB projects. The provisions and principles in the LARF will supersede the provisions \nof relevant decrees currently in force in Cambodia wherever a gap exists between Government \nregulations and ADB policy. \n \n4.  The  LARF  for  the  Project  (i)  identifies  the  legal  and  policy  frameworks  of  the \nGovernment and appropriate ADB policies and guidelines; (ii) sets out procedures and policies \non LAR to guide impacts during subproject design and implementation; and (iii) outlines steps \nnecessary for preparing preliminary LAR investigations and provincial LARPs. The LARF guides \nany minor land acquisition and ensures that any loss of land, income, or assets is either (i) \nvoluntarily contributed, or (ii) compensated to the affected person (AP) at full replacement cost \nat current market value. Compensation for loss of structures will be in cash or materials at full \nreplacement  cost  at  current  market  value  with  no  deduction  in  compensation  for  age, \ndepreciation, or salvageable materials, sufficient to cover the cost of materials and labor. All \nAPs are eligible for the same entitlements, regardless of gender and ethnicity.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Not significant means that the number of affected persons experiencing major impacts in each subproject is 200 \npersons or less. Households experiencing major impact are relocated and/or lose 10% or more of their total \nproductive assets. ", "40   Appendix 7 \n5.  In cases where local communities or individuals elect to make voluntary contribution of \naffected land without compensation, the process shall be acceptable only if (i) there has been \nfull  consultation  with  landowners  and  any  non-titled  affected  people  on  site  selection;  (ii) \nvoluntary donations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people and are linked \ndirectly to benefits for the affected people, with community-sanctioned measures to replace any \nlosses that are agreed through verbal and written record by affected people; (iii) the voluntary \ndonation is confirmed through a verbal or written record and verified by an independent third \nparty; and (iv) adequate grievance redress mechanisms are in place. \n \nC.  Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition \n \n6.  Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum. The location of water supply systems and \npublic latrines will be determined through a community-based approach. Site selection for water \nsupply systems and latrines shall be made in full consultation with any people living on land (title \nand non-title holders) that is deemed suitable for use by a water supply system, latrine, or other \ninfrastructure facility built by the Project. \n \n7.  A preliminary LAR investigation will follow the entitlement matrix in the LARF, for each \nsubproject. Identification of APs will be carried out as part of the social assessment during \nsubproject preparation or preparation of the water supply and sanitation village plan (WSSVP). \nThe cutoff date will be established when the WSSVP is developed and the technical options \nselected.  \n \n8.  The preliminary LAR investigation will be part of the community decision-making process. \nThe investigation shall include (i) details of the water supply and sanitation infrastructure to be \nbuilt in a village (e.g., the type, number, and size); (ii) types of losses, including any land tenure \nissues;  (iii)  categories  of  APs  (e.g.,  persons,  households,  businesses);  (iv)  estimated \ncompensation  amounts,  or  voluntary  contribution  forms;  (v)  a  list  of  consultations  on  LAR \ndiscussions  and  issues;  and  (vi)  agreement  by  villages  affected  by  any  LAR.  Once  the \ninvestigation is prepared, it shall be shared with the APs for their information. This investigation \nshall be attached to the WSSVP for agreement by the commune council and submitted to the \nPIU for appraisal and implementation. \n \n9.  A provincial LARP will be prepared to consolidate all preliminary LAR investigations for a \nsingle civil works contract. The LARP will be based on detailed designs, will include a summary \nof socioeconomic data of APs, and information on land and other assets in the affected area. \nThe provincial LARP will be disclosed to the APs after preparation and approved by appropriate \nentities before the commencement of LAR-related activities.  \n \nD.  Implementing Arrangements \n \n10.  Participating  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)2 will  work  with  a  commune  land \nacquisition  committee  (CLAC)  to  prepare  preliminary  LAR  investigations,  as  part  of  the \nWSSVPs.  The  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  at  provincial  departments  of  rural \ndevelopment (PDRDs) will review and consolidate these investigations. The PIU/PDRD will \nprepare the provincial LARP for each cluster of subprojects according to a single civil works \ncontract. The PIU/PDRD will also conduct additional consultations with APs in the villages. They \nwill  submit  the  LARP  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment (MRD). MRD will then endorse the LARP and submit it to the Inter-Ministerial \n                                                 \n2 NGOs will be contracted to help implement the community mobilization and skills development component, in which \nvillage water supply and sanitation plans will be prepared. ", "Appendix 7    41\nResettlement  Committee  (IRC),  or  any  successor  agency,  for  review  and  approval.  The \nchairman of the IRC is responsible for LARP approval. MRD will then submit the approved \nLARP  to  ADB  for  concurrence.  Approval  will  be  given  before  LAR-related  activities  can \ncommence. All LAR activities must be completed before ADB can issue a \u201cno objection\u201d to the \nawarding of civil works contracts.  \n \n11.  A  national  resettlement/social  specialist  will  be  recruited  for  6  person-months.  The \nspecialist  will  conduct  awareness  meetings  and  training  workshops  for  project  officers, \ngovernment officials, and villagers on the LARF and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \nThese meetings will be part of the overall project implementation arrangements. The specialist \nwill  also  assist  in  the  preparation  and  supervision  of  provincial  LARPs  and  preliminary \ninvestigations. A resettlement/social officer will participate in the PMU and each of the PIUs. \n \n12.  The Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation improvements in an estimated \n1,760 subprojects or villages. An estimated LAR budget of $125 per subproject, including 20% \ncontingency,  has  been  assumed  and  is  part  of  the  overall  project  budget  (approximately \n$220,000 in total). Incremental implementation costs, including project staff and consultant costs, \nare included in the overall project implementation costs. The Government will provide adequate \nstaff  to  manage  LAR  and  additional  budget  support  to  cover  LAR-related  costs  that  are \nunforeseen at the time of LARF preparation. \n \n13.  Internal monitoring of the progress of provincial LARPs will be conducted by PMU/MRD \nthrough the PIU/PDRDs and CLACs. Coordination with IRC and the provincial resettlement unit \nis important to ensure the timely payment of compensation to APs. The PIU/PDRD will prepare \nmonthly monitoring reports and include the findings in its overall quarterly progress report to \nPMU/MRD and IRC. The PMU/MRD will then consolidate the information and submit updates in \ntheir reports to ADB. An independent external monitor acceptable to ADB will be appointed by \nthe Government for about 18 person-months to monitor LAR. External monitoring reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB, PMU/MRD, and IRC simultaneously. \n \nE.  Consultations and Disclosure \n \n14.  The LARF will be disclosed on the ADB website upon Board approval, and subsequent \nprovincial  LARPs  will  be  posted  following  ADB  approval.  To  meet  the  requirements  for \ncommunity consultation, information about LAR will be shared with villagers: (i) initially, when \nrepresentatives of commune council and villages are informed of the Project, its components, \nand relevant social and safeguard issues; (ii) during the identification of village water supply and \nsanitation needs, so that villagers can make informed choices about different water supply and \nsanitation options in their villages; and (iii) after the provincial LARP has been prepared, and \ncompensation amounts have been determined.  \n \nF.  Complaints and Grievances \n \n15.  Affected people will be informed of the process and their right to lodge grievances \nverbally  and/or  in  writing  during  initial  consultations,  social  surveys,  and  at  the  time  of \ncompensation.  They  will  be  exempted  from  all  taxes  and  administrative  and  legal  fees. \nComplaints and grievances will be filed first with CLACs. If no settlement is reached within 15 \ndays, the complaint will be raised to the district officer. If no settlement is reached within 15 days, \nthe complaint will be submitted to the provincial grievance committee within the provincial \nresettlement unit for consideration. If no settlement is reach within 30 days, the complaint will be \nsubmitted to the provincial courts for resolution. ", " 42  Appendix 8 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The objective of the proposed Tonle Sap Rural Supply Water and Sanitation Sector \nProject (the Project) is to improve the safe water supply, sanitation systems, and general \nhygienic  environment  for  people  living  in  1,760  villages  in  the  five  project  provinces  of \nBattambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. The proposed \nProject is a sector project classified as environmental category B under the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The initial environmental examination \n(IEE) was conducted for the Project as a whole and two subprojects in Tnaot and Trapeang \nChhuk villages. Under Cambodia\u2019s Sub-decree of Environmental Impact Assessment1, IEE is \nnot required for each subproject2 of the proposed Project. To ensure appropriate environmental \nscreening,  however,  a  preliminary  environmental  evaluation  will  be  prepared  for  each \nsubproject, and IEEs for a cluster of subprojects will be prepared and submitted to the PMU for \nits review and endorsement. If there are any critical environmental issues recognized by the \nPMU, IEEs will be submitted to ADB for its review and approval prior to the award of civil works \ncontracts.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The  proposed  Project  has  five  components,  as  presented  in  Table  A8.1.  The \nenvironmental assessment has been conducted for components B and C, and environmental \nconsiderations are included in the other components to strengthen the environmental mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring, and enhance the ownership, of the project-affected communities to \nsustain the environmental benefits of the Project.  \n \nTable A8.1: Summary of Proposed Project Components \n \nComponent  Activities \nA.

About \n80% of the rainfall occurs during the southwest monsoon.  \n \n4.  Surface water elevations in the project area are controlled by the river elevation in the \nMekong\u2013Tonle Sap system and Tonle Sap lake. Groundwater resources are plentiful throughout \nthe  country.3  The  World  Health  Organization-Cambodia  nationwide  groundwater  quality \ninvestigation4 reported elevated iron, manganese, nitrite, and arsenic concentrations in a well \ninstalled in 1998 by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in the Kampong Svay district, \nclose to Stoeng Sen. Residents drink both surface water and groundwater, but groundwater \nremains more popular in rural areas.   \n \n5.  Cambodia harbors great biological diversity, both terrestrial and aquatic. The provinces \nof Kampong Thum and Pousat border Tonle Sap lake and encompass extensive flooded forests \ngenerally recognized as a composition of several distinctive vegetation types and floristic zones, \nincluding  short  trees  and  scrub;  tall,  dense  gallery  forests;  and  herbaceous,  floating,  or \nemergent aquatic vegetation. Subprojects under the proposed Project will be, however, within \nestablished village areas, and ecological and archaeological resources are likely to be outside \nthe village areas and unlikely to be affected by the proposed improvements.   \n \n2.  Human and Economic Development  \n \n6.  The population of the target villages varies from around 2,000\u20132,100 persons in 406 \nhouseholds (Trapeang Chhuk) to 368 persons in 74 households (Stoeng Leu). The villages are \nmostly rural in character and are engaged in farming and livestock rearing. About 40\u201350% of the \npopulation in the project areas is poor, which is above the national average of 36%.    \n \n7.  The villages rely on a combination of existing water sources for current supply including \nsurface ponds, shallow wells, and occasional deep wells. The use of latrines in rural areas is still \nuncommon, with the exception people living in flooded areas. Sanitation conditions in the vicinity \nof  wells  are  generally  poor.  The  data  collected  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  in  2002  showed  that  30\u201480%  of  the  households  surveyed  had  water-related \ndiseases over the past year.  The most prevalent are diarrhoea and other intestinal infections.   \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  Potential negative impacts associated with the design, construction and operation of the \nproposed  subprojects  will  be  temporary,  minor,  and  localized  and  can  be  mitigated  to \nacceptable levels. Potential impacts include (i) location-specific impacts, (ii) the availability of \ngroundwater and its quality, (iii) construction impacts, and (iv) sustainability of drinking water \nquality.  \n \n9.  The rehabilitation and/or installation of wells will be carried out within existing villages. \nEnvironmental screening criteria will eliminate any subprojects located in ecologically sensitive \nareas. Screening for unexploded ordnance will eliminate the risk of accidents. Very minor land \nacquisition may be required, and a land acquisition and resettlement plan will be prepared to \nguide compensation. Groundwater resources are plentiful throughout the country (footnote 2). \n                                                 \n3  According to the 1999 information database system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(AQUASTAT), total renewable groundwater resource is 17.6 km3 per year. \n4\n  Feldman, Peter and Rosenboom. 2000.

Water quality testing will be required at the time of well \ndevelopment, to ensure that groundwater meets the drinking water quality standards set by the \nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy. A set of environmental specifications will be included in \nconstruction contracts. Extensive environmental and hygiene training, together with water and \nsanitation monitoring programs, will ensure sustainable project environmental benefits.    \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n1.  Environmental Laws \n \n10.  The Department of Environmental Impact Assessment within the Ministry of Environment \n(MOE) administers the Environmental Protection Law (EPL). MOE is responsible for policy, \nrules, regulations, and guidelines related to environmental quality. A department of environment, \nestablished in each province, is responsible for implementing the EPL in the province, including \nmonitoring,  enforcement,  and  review/approval  of  IEEs  for  small-scale  projects.  The \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) subdecree of the MOE stipulates that all development \nprojects are subject to environmental impact assessment. However, the subdecree requires IEE \nor EIA only for listed projects including piped water supply projects serving more than 10,000 \npeople. A subproject under a rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) project does not meet \nthis criterion.    \n \n2.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n11.  The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) is the Executing Agency, where the project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  is  established.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nplanning, coordination, and implementation. An environment/health education officer will be \nappointed within the PMU.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up within each \nprovincial  department  of  rural  development  (PDRD).  At  each  PIU,  a  sanitation/health \neducation/environment officer will be recruited. Water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) in \ncharge of the operation and maintenance of the project facilities will be established for each \nwater point within each community and registered at the commune councils. PIUs assume \noverall  environmental  responsibility  including  preparation  of  preliminary  environmental \nevaluations and IEEs and environmental monitoring.  \n \n3.  Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n12.  As no formal monitoring programs for wells or sanitation facilities are in place, the \nproposed Project will provide a number of measures to strengthen the PDRDs\u2019 monitoring \ncapacity  including  groundwater  testing,  water  quality  testing,  and  the  establishment  of  a \nnationwide RWSS database. Relevant guidelines and manuals will be developed. Based on \nthese  guidelines,  specific  indicators  for  water  and  sanitation  will  be  developed  to  help \nenvironmental  officers  in  the  PIUs  carry  out  monitoring  activities  during  construction  and \noperation, and ensure compliance with the monitoring requirements set forth in the IEE and \nadherence to drinking water quality standards set forth in Table A8.2. Monitoring results will be \nrecorded in the database. PIUs will monitor and report quarterly to the PMU the progress of \nimplementation. \n ", "                    Appendix 8  45\nTable A8.2: Priority Parameters \n \nParameters  Maximum Value \npH  6.5\u20138.5 \nTurbidity  5 NTU \nArsenica  0.05 mg/l \nIron  0.30 mg/l \nTotal Dissolved Solids  800 mg/l \nThermo Tolerant Coliforms or E.

Under  the  community  mobilization  and  skills  development  component,  hygiene  and \nsanitation education as well as operation and maintenance training will be provided to WSUGs \nto ensure appropriate management of individual and public water supply and sanitation facilities \nand disposal of human and animal wastes.   \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n14.  As part of a participatory rural appraisal process, extensive surveys and community \nconsultation were conducted in three villages in February\u2013March 2002, and in two additional \nvillages in April\u2013May 2005, and during project fact-finding from 10 to 20 May 2005. In general, \nparticipants welcomed the proposed design of the Project. The main environmental concerns \ninclude lack of water during the dry season, groundwater quality, and related health concerns. \nDisturbances and inconveniences to the villagers during construction were also mentioned. \nThose concerns were taken into account in the overall project design, groundwater testing and \nmonitoring plans, and environmental provision of civil works.  \n \n15.  Public consultation is an ongoing and integral part of project implementation. Continuous \ndialogue  with  project-affected  and/or  beneficiary  communities,  as  well  as  with  relevant \ngovernments,  will  be  carried  out  during  detailed  design  and  implementation.  During \nimplementation, the environment/health education officer at the PMU and the sanitation/health \neducation/environment officers at each PIU will work closely work with local NGOs to ensure \nthat any concerns and issues raised by project communities are addressed.  \n \nG.   Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n \n17.  An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF)5 has been developed to \nspecify  the  subproject  selection  criteria,  procedural  steps  to  carry  out  environmental \nassessment for each subproject, and institutional responsibilities. The Project is classified as \nenvironmental category B, and no subprojects to be classified for category A or environmentally \nsensitive B will be selected. PIUs have the overall responsibility of screening, conducting, and \npreparing  IEEs  and  submitting  them  to  the  PMU  for  review  and  approval.  PIUs  are  also \nresponsible for reporting to the PMU and ADB as part of the quarterly reporting.  \n \nH.   Conclusions \n \n18.  The proposed Project will have significant positive impacts on the quality of life and the \nenvironment of the project communities. Potential negative impacts associated with the design, \nconstruction, and operation of the proposed subproject activities will be temporary, minor, and \nlocalized and can be mitigated to acceptable levels  It is determined that a detailed EIA for the \nsubproject is not warranted. \n                                                 \n5 Detailed in Supplementary Appendix B. \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nForeign  Local \n     currency  currency  Total \nA.

", "  Appendix 10  47 \nRATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOR USING ADF IX GRANT \n \n1.  As a poor, debt-stressed country, Cambodia is eligible for Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) grant financing of up to 50% in its Asian Development Bank (ADB) lending program, as \nspelled  out  in  ADF  IX  Donors\u2019  Report:  Development  Effectiveness  for  Poverty  Reduction. \nCambodia\u2019s indicative planning figure for 2005\u20132006 is $104.30 million. This translates into a \n$52.15 million grant for the 2-year period or about $26 million yearly. It is recommended that \nADB provide the proposed Tonle Sap Rural Supply Water and Sanitation Sector Project (the \nProject) with $18 million in grant financing from ADF IX grant facilities. This appendix describes \nthe rationale and justifications for grant financing of the Project. The proposed grant-financed \nactivities  are  described  in  paragraphs  17\u201322  of  the  main  text.  Allocation  to  activities  is \npresented in Appendix 9, and the monitoring and evaluation plan for grant-funded activities is \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix Q. \n \n2.  Alignment with country\u2019s development strategies. Rural water supply and sanitation \n(RWSS) have been integral to the Government\u2019s overall strategy for rural development and \npoverty reduction. The Rectangular Strategy,1 National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS),2 \nand  Cambodian  Millennium  Development  Goals 3  place  high  priority  on  RWSS.  ADB\u2019s \noverarching goal for Cambodia, as defined in its Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009) \n(CSP),4 is  sustainable poverty  reduction.  To achieve  this  goal,  the  CSP  focuses  on  three \nstrategic pillars: (i) broad-based economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) \ngood governance. Provision of RWSS facilities is highlighted as one means to achieve inclusive \nsocial development, and the RWSS sector is identified as one in which ADB will play a catalytic \nrole. The CSP also stresses three crosscutting themes\u2014private sector development, gender, \nand the environment\u2014that support poverty reduction. The Project will contribute to all three \ncrosscutting  themes.  The  Tonle  Sap  basin  is  identified  as  the  priority  area  where  ADB \ninterventions will be progressively focused. The CSP (para. 72) identifies rural water supply and \nsanitation  as  one  of  the  two  sectors  for  grant  financing,  together  with  the  control  of \ncommunicable diseases. \n \n3.  Alignment with the national poverty reduction strategy. Rural households account \nfor almost 90% of the total poor. The poverty rate in rural areas, estimated at 40.1%, is much \nhigher than in urban areas, where 29.7% of the population is poor. Under-5 child mortality in \nCambodia remains one of the highest in Asia, at 124 per 1,000 live births, and has increased in \nthe last decade. Maternal mortality is estimated at 437 per 100,000 live births. While the number \nof people with access to safe water and sanitation has increased since 1989, mainly as a result \nof external assistance to the sector, Cambodia remains the country with the lowest water and \nsanitation coverage in East Asia and one of the lowest in the world (34% for access to safe \nwater and 16% for access to improved sanitation).5 About 60% of the urban population has \naccess to a safe water source, and 49% has access to improved sanitation. In the rural areas, \nthe overall coverage is much lower, at only about 32% for rural water supply and 13% for \nsanitation. For the poorest 20%, the percentage with access to safe water falls to 4%.6 The \n                                                 \n1  Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004.

", "48  Appendix 10 \nProject will contribute to several development priorities set in the NPRS including (i) increasing \naccess to clean water, (ii) increasing use of hygienic latrines, (iii) controlling acute diarrheal \ndiseases, and (iv) reducing child mortality. \n \n4.  Poverty reduction impacts. The five project provinces around the Tonle Sap basin \nhave a combined population of 3.5 million people in 2005, of whom 1.35 million (or 39%) are \nbelow the official poverty line. About 85% of the total population in the five provinces is rural. \nThe Project is expected to meet the Cambodian Millennium Development Goal (CMDG) targets \n7.10 and 7.12 in the five provinces by providing safe water to 1.1 million rural people and latrine \naccess  to  0.7  million  rural  people  by  2011.  Some  50\u201370%  of  the  Project\u2019s  expected \nbeneficiaries are poor, given the high proportion of poor in the project area and the targeting of \nthe  poorest  households  and  communes.  Because  poor  households  suffer  disproportionate \nsickness and consequently have disproportionately high expenditures on health care, the poor \nwill gain the most from the supply of safe water and the project activities promoting health. \n \n5.  Water as a basic human need and the Millennium Development Goals. Access to \nsafe water is a fundamental human need and, therefore, a basic human right. The lack of clean \nwater jeopardizes people\u2019s physical and social health and is an affront to human dignity. The \nProject aims to reduce poverty by improving access to clean water for the rural poor, particularly \nfor the vulnerable groups including women and children. The Project will assist the Government \nin its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 (reducing child mortality), \n6 (combating malaria and other diseases), and 7 (halving the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water) and will contribute directly to the MDG targets 5, 8, \nand 10.  \n \n6.  Sector investment demand and the Government\u2019s fiscal situation. The investment \nfunds required to meet the goals of the Government for 2015 are estimated at $116 million by \nthe sector investment plan (2005). Given the very tight fiscal position of the Government and the \nlow level of cost recovery for RWSS investment, a large part of the funding is expected to come \nfrom external sources. The demand is well beyond the Government's fiscal capacity. While the \nGovernment recorded an estimated debt service ratio (relative to exports of goods and services) \nof only 2.9% in 2003, the ratio of debt service to government revenue was 14.8%, placing \nCambodia in the category of debt-stressed countries.   \n \n7.  The Government\u2019s strong commitment with the sector. The National Water and \nSanitation  Policy  approved  by  the  Government  in  February  2003  states  that  every  rural \nCambodian should have access to safe water and sanitation by 2025 and insists on three major \naspects: (i) the role of the ministries as regulatory and monitoring agencies, as opposed to their \nprevious role in direct implementation; (ii) the provision of RWSS services based on user \ndemand, a process that includes \u201cvoice and choice\u201d in technology selection and the willingness \nof the users to share costs; and (iii) the importance of private sector participation.  \n \n8.  The policy recognizes the importance of four major guiding principles: (i) the social and \neconomic value of water, (ii) the promotion of safe behavior, (iii) the importance of sustainable \nmanagement  of  rural  water  resources,  and  (iv)  local  community  participation  and  decision \nmaking. A sector investment plan was approved by Ministry of Rural Development in January \n2005. The plan describes overall sector financing requirements. Resources equivalent to $116 \nmillion of capital investment will be needed to reach the government objectives by 2015, of \nwhich the Government has committed to contribute 9% despite its difficult financial situation. \nThis demonstrates the Government\u2019s strong commitment to the sector. ", "Appendix 11   49 \nPROJECT MANAGEMENT \n \nA.  Project Steering Committee \n \n1.  The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) will be responsible for overall implementation \nof the proposed Tonle Sap Rural Supply Water and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project), \ntaking charge of physical implementation and financial disbursement. A secretary of state of \nMRD  (the  coordinator)  will  coordinate  the  Project  and  chair  a  project  steering  committee \ncomprising, as permanent members, the rural health care, community development, rural water \nsupply,  and  planning  departments;  the  gender  working  group  in  MRD;  and  the  provincial \ndepartments  of  rural  development  (PDRDs)  of  the  five  participating  provinces.  Other \ndepartments or ministries may also attend as necessary. The project steering committee will \nmeet every 3 months and will have the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Ensure the timely implementation of the policy and institutional reforms included \nin the Project. \n(ii)  Report  to  the  Government  on  progress  in  project  implementation  and  sector \nreforms. \n(iii)  Validate the general orientation, objectives and procedures of the Project and the \nplanning of intervention in the five participating provinces. \n(iv)  Ensure effective coordination among the different departments of MRD and with \nother ministries, participating provinces, and development partners working in the \nRWSS sector. \n(v)  Approve and supervise the plans and activities of the project management unit \n(PMU) and project implementation units (PIUs). \n \nB.  Project Management Unit  \n \n2.  The PMU has been established at the Department of Rural Water Supply of MRD in \nPhnom Penh. It is led by the project director. A full-time project manager will be responsible for \nday-to-day  operations.  In  addition,  the  PMU  comprises  13  technical  and  support  staff  and \ninternational and domestic consultants. The director of the Department of Rural Health Care will \nprovide policy guidance to sanitation staff in the PMU. The team leader of the consultants will \nassist the project director and the project manager for the duration of the Project. The main roles \nand responsibilities of the PMU are the following: \n \n(i)  Ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with rural water supply and \nsanitation (RWSS) policy, the project principles, and the strategic crosscutting \nissues. \n(ii)  Propose general orientation, planning, and procedures for the Project. \n(iii)  Allocate funds according provincial needs and plans. \n(iv)  Provide technical and management support to the five PIUs. \n(v)  Participate in procurement committees in the provinces when the value of the \ncontract package is higher than $50,000. \n(vi)  Supervise, facilitate, and expedite Project implementation. \n(vii)  Help the MRD national and provincial departments introduce in their operations \nthe national RWSS strategy and the guidelines prepared by the Project. \n(viii)  Review and implement the project performance monitoring system. \n(ix)  Ensure that a national RWSS database, accessible to all users, is established \nand regularly updated.

Facilitate  approval  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans \n(LARPs) and IEEs prepared by the Project. \n \nC.  Project Implementation Unit \n3.  PIUs will be established in each participating province, located within the PDRD. Each \nPIU will be headed by a part-time provincial project director, a senior official of the PDRD. A full-\ntime provincial project manager will be in charge of operational aspects and will be assisted by a \ndomestic consultant. Each PIU will accommodate the domestic consultant, the counterparts \nseconded to the Project, and supporting staff recruited for project implementation. The main \ntasks of the PIU include the following: \n(i)  Implement the Project in accordance with the Project principles and the strategic \ncrosscutting issues. \n(ii)  Plan  activities  locally  by  selecting  the  district,  communes  and  villages  for \nintervention  according  the  project  selection  criteria  and  the  provincial  and \ncommune development plans. \n(iii)  Select,  contract  and  supervise  local  NGOs,  which  will  assist  the  PIU  in  the \nimplementation of the community mobilization and skills development component. \n(iv)  Organize  project  information  meetings  in  each  district  and  invite  all \nrepresentatives from commune councils and villages. \n(v)  Establish  procurement  committees  to  pre-qualify  and  select  private  sector \ncontractors for implementing civil works. \n(vi)  Adapt technical designs according to the needs of the province. \n(vii)  Supervise field officers in charge of Project\u2019s district operations. \n(viii)  Collect provincial progress and monitoring data for timely correctional action and \nimprovement and updating the project performance monitoring system. \n(ix)  Supervise the technical quality of RWSS facilities constructed under the Project. \n(x)  Coordinate all field work by regularly sharing the inputs of relevant stakeholders. \n(xi)  Report to the PMU and the provincial rural development committee. \n(xii)  Implement LAR and environment activities as outlined in the LARF and EARF for \neach subproject. These activities include preparing and submitting LARPs and \nIEEs for clusters of subprojects and addressing stakeholders\u2019 complaints and \ngrievances. \n \nD.  District Office of Rural Development \n \n4.  One district officer from each district in participating provinces will allocate a full-time \nofficer to assist project implementation. The tasks of each district office of rural development will \ninclude the following: \n \n(i)  Assist the PIU in the implementation and supervision of project activities. ", "Appendix 11   51 \n(ii)  Help water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) supervise and monitor physical \nconstruction. \n(iii)  Ensure that the quantity and quality of construction are in line with the standards \nstipulated by the Project. \n \nE.  Commune Councils \n \n5.  The Project will reinforce the commune planning process by supporting the priorities \nidentified by commune councils. Annually, each commune council collates the development \npriorities of the villages under its jurisdiction through the planning and budgeting committee \n(PBC) sessions. Each village sends two representatives\u2500usually the village chief and a female \nvillager\u2500to participate in budgeting and planning sessions and present the village priorities. The \noutput of these sessions is the commune development and investment plan. The plan includes \nall  prioritized  infrastructure  and  other  items  perceived  to  be  important  for  the  village.  All \ncommune development plans are submitted at the district integration workshop for potential \ndonor, agency and government funding. The PIUs take part in the district integration workshop to \nidentify potential project interventions, based on project selection criteria. Where the regular \ncommune and district planning process proves ineffective at identifying project interventions, an \nalternative option is to provide project support directly at to communities with the participation of \nthe village and commune concerned. The main tasks on the commune council will be the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Participate in district project information meetings organized by the PIUs. \n(ii)  Collect demands from the village and present them at the district integration \nworkshop. \n(iii)  Approve water supply and sanitation village plans (WSSVPs) and submit them to \nthe PIU. \n(iv)  Register the WSUG. \n(v)  Assume ownership of the facilities constructed under the Project. \n(vii)  Establish a commune land acquisition and environment committee to help the PIU \ncoordinate and implement LAR and environment issues. The committee will be \nthe first point of contact for any complaints or grievances related to LAR and the \nenvironment. \n \nF.  Villages \n \n6.  The  Project  will  work  with  villages  authorities,  PBC  members,  village  development \ncommittees (VDCs) where they exist, pagoda committees, teachers, and customary leaders to \ndevelop a WSSVP based on a rapid appraisal of water needs, identification and location of \nsocioeconomic  groups  in  the  village,  informed  choice  of  technical  options,  identification  of \nWSUGs,  and  commitment  to  contribute  financially  to  capital  costs  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  RWSS  facilities.  The  Project  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  WSSVP \nrealistically responds to demand and includes very poor households, ethnic/indigenous minority \ngroups, and women. The tasks in villages will include the following: \n \n(i)  The village chief, PBC members, VDC members, and key informants attend the \ndistrict information meeting organized by the PIU and NGO. \n(ii)  The village chief, PBC members, VDC members, and key informants organize a \nmeeting of the whole population to solicit water and sanitation needs and prepare \na  project  proposal.  The  PBC  members  refer  the  needs  of  the  village  to  the \ncommune. ", " 52  Appendix 11 \n(iii)  PBC members provide feedback to villagers about the decision of the commune \ncouncil, the district, and the PIU. \n(iv)  All  interested  villagers  participate  in  the  community  mobilization  program \norganized by the NGO. \n(v)  All villagers (a) prioritize their water supply and sanitation needs, (b) prove their \nwillingness and ability to contribute to capital investment and operation (O&M) \nand maintenance costs, (c) identify the very poor households in the village, and \n(d) identify water users\u2019 catchments and good positions for water points, which \nwill provide the basis for establishing WSUGs. \n(vi)  The village chief, PBC members, and VDC members approve the WSSVPs and \nsubmit  them  to  the  commune  council  for  approval.  The  plan  will  include  a \npreliminary LAR investigation and a preliminary environmental investigation. \n \nG.  Board of the Water and Sanitation Users\u2019 Group \n \n7.  There will be a WSUG for each water system. The roles and responsibilities of WSUG \nmembers and its board will be specified in the guidelines for WSUGs prepared and approved by \nMRD. The WSUG will nominate users to establish a board, the main tasks of which will be the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Supervise and certify the construction of the water and sanitation systems. \n(ii)  Ensure proper O&M of the system built under the Project and ensure that the \nwater system is functioning and providing safe water throughout the year to all \nhouseholds in its catchment. \n(iii)  Collect users\u2019 contributions for construction and maintenance. \n(iv)  Appoint a private operator, if necessary, to help operate the system. \n \nH.  Households, Users \n \n8.  The main tasks and duties of the households will be the following: \n \n(i)  Participate in identification and planning meetings in villages and in awareness \nand  hygiene  education  activities  and  select  the  type  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation solution that meets their needs. \n(ii)  Provide 10% of the capital cost for constructing the water supply facility and part \nof the cost for sanitation infrastructure, in cash and in-kind.  \n(iii)  Elect a WSUG board. \n(iv)  Provide financial contributions to the WSUG.  \n(v)  Maintain household latrines and household water equipment, such as jumbo jars \nand filters. \n ", "Appendix 12       53\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\nTask Description\nQ3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\n-2 -1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  This appendix demonstrates the economic justification for small-scale water supply and \nsanitation investments in rural Cambodia, using as case studies three villages in the provinces \nof Kompong Thom and Pursat: Trapeang Chouk, Thnot, and Steung Leu. The proposed Tonle \nSap  Rural Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (the  Project)  will  ultimately  include \nhundreds of similar small-scale investments in other villages. The different types of investments \nwill  be  determined  through  a  participatory  process  of  informed  choice  during  project \nimplementation.  As  such,  a  complete  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  as  a  whole  is  not \npossible  at  this  stage.  In  addition  to  demonstrating  the  economic  justification  of  such \ninvestments,  the  economic  analysis  provides  a  model  and  guidelines  for  further  economic \nanalysis and selection of additional investments. \n \nB.  Rationale for Government Involvement, and the Role of Private Sector \n \n2.  The economic rationale for Government involvement in rural water supply and sanitation \nis based largely on poverty reduction. In theory, the private sector should be able to develop \nand supply water and sanitation services, and private investment has in fact occurred in some \nvillages. The main obstacles to widespread private investment are the dispersed, diffused and \ndiverse nature of the market, the lack of an efficient private sector, and the low income of \npotential consumers. \n \n3.  The main quantifiable benefits of the water supply component are reductions in the cost \nof buying and conveying water to private homes, and of medical expenses, and increases in the \ntime available for education, generation income, and recreation. These benefits will be realized \nby improving or developing new permanent water sources close to people's homes. As the \npopulation density of rural Cambodia is quite low, developing rural water supply requires many \nvery small investments, each investment serving few people. The low income of the people \nserved means that they are neither willing nor able to pay enough for water and sanitation \nservices to generate sufficient profits to attract private investors. \n \n4.  As part of its water supply and sanitation policy, the Government therefore intervenes to \nprovide most of the initial capital investment to develop rural water supply and sanitation. Water \nand  sanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs)  will  manage  the  facilities  from  the  outset  and  be \nresponsible for all operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. In all cases, a user contribution will \nbe required to sustain the facility and cover O&M costs. The Project expects and encourages \nthe  development  of  a  private  market  for  managing  water  supply  facilities  and  that,  when \nnecessary, villages will contract individuals or small private firms to help them to maintain the \nfacilities. \n \nC.  Main Assumptions \n \n5.  All monetary values are constant 2004 US dollars, the common currency in Cambodia, \ndespite the existence of the domestic riel (KR). The horizon for each investment is taken as 20 \nyears, with no residual value at the end. The market exchange rate is KR4,000/$1.00, and a \nstandard exchange rate factor of 1.11 was applied to the price of tradable goods. All taxes and \nduties were excluded from market prices, and the opportunity cost of unskilled labor was taken \nas 70% of the market wage rate. \n ", "56   Appendix 14 \nD.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n6.  As  the  Project  will serve  hundreds  of  small communities  in  various  hydrologic  and \nsocioeconomic conditions, it does not propose a single, specific technology for either water \nsupply or sanitation. Instead, it offers a set of recommended options, from which communities \nthemselves will choose their preferred option.   \n \n7.  The  Project  will  provide  a  variety  of  options  for  both  water  supply  and  sanitation. \nAlternatives for water supply include both private and communal systems, with alternatives for \ncommunal supply focusing mainly on groundwater, and alternatives for private supply including \nboth groundwater and household equipment. Alternatives for sanitation include pit latrines and \npour-flush toilets. \n \n8.  In the case studies, two water supply alternatives were identified for each of the three \nvillages, and each option was further refined and developed using the results of socioeconomic \nsurveys.  Table  A14.1  shows,  for  each  village,  the  least-cost  water  supply  alternative,  the \nalternative that was considered, and the ratio of the present value of the total cost of the least-\ncost alternative to the present value of the total cost of the other alternative. The benefit-cost \nanalysis below is based on the least-cost alternative. \n \nTable A14.1:  Least-Cost Analysis of the Two Alternatives for Water Supply \nVillage  Least-Cost Alternative  Other Alternative  Ratio of Costs \nTrapeang Chouk  Three deep boreholes with  Four deep boreholes with  0.81 \nhand pumps  hand pumps \nThnot  One borehole with four  Four deep boreholes with  0.78 \nstandpipes  hand pumps \nSteung Leu  Individual boreholes with  Individual rain water  0.81 \nhand pumps  collection and storage \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.  A least-cost analysis for the sanitation component is not applicable, as each household \nwill itself choose its preferred alternative. \n \nE.  Benefits \n \n10.  The  water  supply  component  of  the  Project  will  reduce  the  total  economic  cost  of \nobtaining water for each household. Water supplied by the Project will replace some water used \nin each household (a non-incremental output), and will enable households to increase their \nwater consumption (an incremental output). During the dry season, the Project will replace all of \nthe water currently used by households, estimated to be 10-15 liters per capita per day (lpcd).  \nDuring  the  wet  season,  households  will  continue  to  obtain  some  water  from  their  current \nsources; the socioeconomic surveys indicate that households can continue to obtain 30\u201340% of \ntheir water from these sources. \n \n11.  The socioeconomic surveys indicate that the Project will enable households to increase \ntheir water consumption up to an average of 25 lpcd. On a yearly average, then, households will \nobtain 20 lpcd from the Project.1 The non-incremental component of the 20 lpcd is determined \nby current water use, which is shown for each village in Table A14.2. The Project will not affect \nthe use of water outside the house, so this is not considered in the economic analysis. \n                                                 \n1  That is, (6 months*25 lpcd + 6 months*0.65*25 lpcd)/12 months.

The  total  economic  cost  of  non-incremental  water  depends  on  the  time  spent  in \ncollection, storage, and any other identified costs. Time spent in collection, determined from \nsocioeconomic surveys, was 20\u201365 hours per household per month. The value of time was \nmeasured at 70% of the official average rural wage of KR4,500 per day. The cost of storage \nwas estimated at KR83,850 for 2 cubic meters of storage capacity in drum(s), with an average \nlifespan of 20 years per drum. Households will continue to store water under the Project but use \nsmaller and fewer storage containers. The Project therefore offers some savings from the cost \nof replacing storage containers. Table A14.2 shows the average cost of current water per \nvillage, as well as the cost under the Project. \n \n13.  The sanitation component of the Project provides many private and social benefits, but \nthe economic analysis focuses only on private benefits. Private benefits were measured using \nthe  households'  willingness  to  pay  for  a  private  facility.  Table  A14.2  shows  the  average \nwillingness to pay for each village. The Project has many other benefits that, due to constraints \non time and information, were not quantified. The water supply component may provide water of \nbetter quality, and so reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. Other social benefits may \nfollow from the reduced expenditure on collecting water, to the extent that the time and money \nsaved are allocated to socially beneficial activities like education. The sanitation component \nmay also improve public health as well as the local environment. \n \nF.  Benefit-Cost Analysis \n \n14.  Table A14.3 shows the economic internal rate of return for each village. This is shown \nseparately for the water supply component and the sanitation component, as well as for the \nProject as a whole in that village, including the cost of the technical assistance component. \nTable A14.3 makes clear that each component of the Project has a very strong economic basis, \neven  when  including  the  cost  of  technical  assistance,  for  which  no  benefits  have  been \nestimated. \n \nTable A14.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return for each Component in Each Village, and \nfor the Village as a Whole, Including the Cost of Technical Assistance \nVillage  Water supply  Sanitation  Combined, Plus Technical \nAssistance \nTrapeang Chouk  21.9  14.2  21.5 \nThnot  26.2  14.0  23.9 \nSteung Leu  21.6  12.8  19.5 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank.  ", "58   Appendix 14 \n \nG.  Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n15.  The Project will benefit various groups. The direct beneficiaries are the households that \nuse  the  Project's  water  and  those  that  choose  to  acquire  private  latrines.  For  these \nbeneficiaries, the benefit will be greater the closer they are to the water source. Households that \nchoose  not  to  acquire  private  latrines  may  benefit  from  the  latrines  acquired  by  other \nhouseholds, if environmental quality improves from the increased use of private latrines. Other \nbeneficiaries include those employed in managing water supply facilities and the owners and \nemployees of firms engaged in constructing water supply facilities and private latrines. \n \n16.  A few groups will suffer from adverse effects of the Project. The people most likely to \nsuffer  directly  from  adverse  impacts  are  the  owners,  employees,  and  individuals  that  are \ncurrently supplying water, and who could be displaced by the Project. These groups are small \nand limited mostly to those carrying water during the dry season. The Project will not select any \nvillage where private water supply systems already exist. It is unlikely to generate significant \nnew tax revenues, so the Government and taxpayers will not recover much of the Project cost.  \n \n17.  Table A14.4 shows the poverty impact analysis for each of the three villages. The poor \nbenefit as consumers and by supplying labor. Like other groups, some of the project costs for \nthe poor will be borne by the Government. The poverty impact ratio for two of the three villages \nis greater than the 22.6% share of the national gross domestic product generated by the poor. \n \nTable A14.4: Net Benefits Accruing to Consumers, Government, and Labor, and the \nPoverty Impact Ratio for the Village as a Whole \n($) \nVillage  Consumers  Government  Labor  PIR \nTrapeang Chouk  33,118  (15,964)  383  0.32 \nThnot  5,895  (5,083)  122  0.19 \nSteung Leu  1,312  (922)  22  0.28 \n    PIR = poverty impact ratio. \n               Source: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nH.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n18.  Table A14.5 shows, for each village, the percentage change in capital costs, gross \nbenefits, and asset lifetime that would drive the net present value of the total project to zero, at a \n12% discount rate (switching values). The economic benefits are generally less sensitive to \ncapital costs than to gross benefits and asset lifetime. These results indicate that the success of \nthe Project will depend heavily on adequate operation and maintenance of the facilities, to keep \nthe cost of supply below that of current water sources, and to maintain the expected lifespan of \nthe facilities. \n \nTable A14.5: Switching Values for Capital Costs, Gross Benefits, and Asset Lifespan \n(% change from base) \nVillage  Capital Costs  Benefits  Lifespan \nTrapeang Chouk  32  12  18 \nThnot  45  16  21 \nSteung Leu  36  13  17 \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  ", "Appendix 15   59\nCONTRIBUTION PLAN \n \n1.  The purpose of requiring contributions from the community for rural water supply and \nsanitation (RWSS), as in the proposed Tonle Sap Rural Supply Water and Sanitation Sector \nProject (the Project), is to ensure ownership and sustainability of the infrastructure provided by \nthe Project. Community contribution toward capital cost is often used to measure community \nownership. Discussions with villagers about their contribution often revolve around payment for \nthe cost of construction and rarely focus on operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. However, \ninitial contributions for the construction of facilities do not guarantee that users will be able to \noperate and maintain them. A water and sanitation user group (WSUG) will be established \nunder the project for each water point and will include households within a 150-meter catchment \nradius.  WSUGs  are  not  usually  homogenous.  Differences  between  the  better-off  and  the \npoorest households warrant special consideration, as the Project risks marginalizing the poorest \nhouseholds and vulnerable groups. The poorest 20% will be exempted from making cash \ncontributions. Identification of the poorest 20% of households within a village\u2014and of other \nvulnerable households including ethnic minority or indigenous groups and households headed \nby women\u2014will be carried out by the village during the preparation of the water supply and \nsanitation village plans. The identification of the poorest will be verified by the village chief, \ncommune council, and participating nongovernment organization (NGO). This is imperative to \nminimize dissatisfaction among other households and avoid exempting ineligible households. \n \n2.  Community wells and household sanitation facilities will be built on private land. This \nland will be considered a contribution by the private landowner, who will be required to sign a \nvoluntary  contribution  consent  form  according  to  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework (LARF). The landowner will be required to sign an agreement with the water users of \nthe WSUG providing direct access to the water point. This agreement will be countersigned by \nthe  commune  council  chief.1  Other  water  supply  systems  and  sanitation  options  (e.g., \ncommunity wells on public land, ponds, simple piped water systems, and public latrines) will \nfollow the principles set out in the LARF. In cases where systems are built on public land, the \ncommune council will sign an agreement providing right of access to all WSUG members.  \n \n3.  Capital contribution for the construction of water supply systems. Each WSUG will \nprovide a contribution of 10% of the total project cost, of which 3% will be in cash and 7% in-\nkind (Table A15.1). This percentage has been set in accordance with current rules set by the \nNational Committee to Support Communes. The WSUG will collect the cash contribution from \nits members and deliver it to the project implementation unit (PIU), after informing the commune \ncouncil. The PIU will manage the cash contribution of communes, which will be deposited in a \nbank  account  at  the  provincial  level.  Cash  contributions  will  be  collected  before  the \nimplementation phase of each subproject. Individual household contributions for a given water \npoint may vary among the users, with the landowners and other residents living close to the \nwater points paying more than those living further away. The contribution of each household will \nbe decided by each WSUG. The poorest 20%, identified during the rapid appraisal, will be \nexempted from cash contribution but required to provide contribution in-kind (e.g., materials or \nconstruction labor).  \n \n4.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) of water supply systems. Many existing water \nsystems do not function because of inadequate or irresponsible maintenance. The Project will \nassist in the formulation and capacity building of WSUGs. Users will be asked to adhere to \nWSUG rules that explicitly state the need for all users to contribute to O&M, and the right of \n                                                 \n1  This may be the same agreement that the commune council signs with the landowner and WSUG members, where \nthe commune council owns the water point, but agrees to transfer management responsibilities to the WSUG. ", "60   Appendix 15 \naccess  to  the  water  will  depend  on  these  payments.

Contribution for household latrines. No guidelines exist for household contributions to \nsanitation in Cambodia. Different projects have their own approach and requirements. In past \nprojects, contributions from households have been 50\u201370% of total capital cost. Experience \nshows that people are willing and able to pay if they understand the benefits of hygienic latrines. \nThe Project will require households to contribute on average 50% of the cost of the hygienic \nlatrine of their choice, with a varying degree of subsidy depending on the system (Table A15.2). \nA higher-technological option will receive a smaller subsidy than a more basic latrine option. \nThe poorest 20% of households will be exempted from cash contributions but will be required to \ncontribute in-kind (e.g., labor and basic materials for walls and roofs).
