While space-based technology (SBT) has made tremendous advances, this technology \nhas yet to be exploited in supporting evidence-based policy making in Asia and the Pacific. \nSeveral pilot countries in receipt of regional policy and advisory technical assistance (TA)1 have \nexpressed keen interest in adopting SBT for estimating crop areas and forecasting production, \nbecause this technology is known to provide more reliable and timely measurements. In addition, \nit can be used in early warning systems for drought and in measuring flooding. However, while \nliterature on SBT is fairly abundant, developing countries find accessing and consequently using \nSBT very challenging, if not unfeasible, without external technical advice.  \n \n2.  The use of SBT in Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects is also still in its infancy. \nRecent developments in this area are (i) the agreement between ADB and the Japan Aerospace \nExploration Agency (JAXA) to promote disaster management, climate change mitigation and \nadaptation, forest monitoring, and water resources management in Asia and the Pacific by using \nSBT (mainly remote sensing); and (ii) implementation of regional TA under which JAXA agreed \nto assist ADB in applying SBT and information and communication technology for flood risk \nmanagement and training staff of concerned agencies in three pilot countries\u2014Bangladesh, \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam.2  \n \n3.  This TA was conceptualized to promote the use of SBT in formulating and monitoring \nfood security policies. Extensive discussions were held with prospective pilot countries and \nother research organizations that are also studying the use of SBT in agricultural statistics in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific\u2014JAXA;  the  International  Rice  Research  Institute;  the  Philippine  Rice \nResearch  Institute;  and  the  Geo-Informatics  and  Space  Technology  Development  Agency \n(GISTDA), Thailand. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA received \nconcept clearance from ADB Management in December 2012.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Timely and reliable crop production and area estimates are important in monitoring \ngovernment development plans and in mitigating the effects of extreme weather and climate \nchange. These statistics are usually compiled through either administrative reporting systems or \nhousehold surveys. A closer look at the data compilation of many countries revealed that crop \nproduction and other agricultural statistics are collected from administrative reporting systems \nthat are biased and unreliable. Government agricultural personnel assess crop production by \nobserving harvests and by interviewing experts (village heads, farmers, and traders) in their \nassigned localities and reporting the estimates to their next level of bureaucracy, until the \nsummary  statistics  reach  the  national  government.  While  this  data  collection  approach  is \ninexpensive, research has shown that it is prone to large measurement errors. Data collection \nofficers and others involved in the process have vested interests that influence the estimation \nprocess. Agricultural officers tend to overestimate production in their assigned areas to support \ntheir claims of accomplishment. This type of administrative reporting does not usually include a \nvalidation process that could improve the quality of estimates. Inaccurate estimation of staple \nfood production can lead to inappropriate policies and, consequently, unfavorable outcomes, \nand possibly worsening food security. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for Improving Agricultural and Rural Statistics for Food Security. Manila. \n2   ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for Applying Remote Sensing Technology in River Basin Management. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 4 October 2012. \n ", "2   \n5.  If objectively designed and conducted, household surveys can provide better estimates \nand  sampling  error  estimates.  However,  measurement  errors  may  still  arise  because \nmethodological  studies  suggest  that,  during  interviews,  farmers  may  inadvertently  provide \ninaccurate crop areas and production estimates. Instead of actual crop areas, farmers usually \ngive the area of their total landholding, and this could include areas devoted to livestock and \nother activities. Intercropped areas are also difficult to measure. Production estimates would \nprobably exclude areas provided to sharecroppers and land that was used for barter of services. \nMoreover, household surveys require large budget allocations and, hence, instead of being able \nto capture production data every quarter, countries usually conduct annual production surveys \nin which memory recall is often a significant issue. Also, because household surveys take longer \nto process and analyze, their results do not reach the policy makers in time for planning the next \ncropping season. \n \n6.  More advanced countries in Asia and the Pacific have used satellite-based remote \nsensing and other information technology in estimating crop areas and production. Remote \nsensing and similar methods have also been used to quickly assess crop damage due to \nflooding and as an early warning system for drought. Processed satellite data could also be \nstudied further for determining existing paddy field conditions, rice crop growth condition, and \nother  agro-meteorological  information  that  affects  rice  crop  production.  Unlike  household \nsurveys that only measure one specific time period, satellite-based data are recorded more \nfrequently and, hence, the rice cropping calendar can be analyzed further. With more timely and \nreliable data from remote sensing and other similar tools, estimates of rice crop area and \nproduction, even during times of calamity (e.g., damage caused by flood or drought), will be \navailable for policy makers and government agencies to mitigate food security issues and \ndesign intervention for at-risk areas.   \n \n7.  There have also been attempts to use remote sensing for agriculture and food security in \ndeveloping countries in Asia and the Pacific. In Thailand, GISTDA, in close collaboration with \nJAXA, used remote sensing technology (such as synthetic aperture radar [SAR]) for estimating \nrice crop area and forecasting rice production in Khon Kaen province in 2011. The same \ntechnology was being applied in Suphanburi and Roet provinces in 2012. Under an Association \nof  Southeast  Asian  Nations  food  security  information  system  project,  agricultural  land \ninformation system crop areas in Vientiane in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nwere estimated using optical satellite imagery in Google Earth. The International Rice Research \nInstitute is working with the Philippine Rice Research Institute in using satellite imagery to \nestimate rice areas to provide a better basis for micro-insurance purposes. In all of these cases, \nthe success of these projects hinges on the effective upgrading of skills of counterpart staff in \nthe concerned government agencies of developing countries. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The intended impact of the proposed TA is more evidence-based policies and programs \non food security. The expected outcome is improved quality and timeliness of rice crop area and \nproduction estimates and forecasts. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will consist of three major activities: (i) development of customized software \napplications and methodology to estimate paddy rice cultivation area and crop production based \n ", "  3 \non satellite data and in-situ data obtained through crop-cutting experiments at a provincial level \nfor four  pilot  countries,  (ii) training  of counterpart  staff in the four  pilot  countries,  and  (iii) \ndevelopment of an online training program on the use of satellite data for agricultural and rural \nstatistics.  \n \n10.  The four pilot countries\u2014the Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014were \nchosen because of the substantial contribution of the agriculture sector to their economies and \nthe large number of people still employed in agriculture. Thailand, the Philippines, and Viet Nam \nare major world rice producers, and the Philippines is also one of the world\u2019s leading rice \nimporters. The governments  of  these  pilot  countries  are  committed to  institutionalizing  the \nmethods that will be developed under this project so that rice area and production estimates and \nearly warning estimates of rice crop damage will be provided on a timely and regular basis to \nsupport better policy making for, and monitoring of, the agriculture sector.  \n \n11.  To achieve timely results that can be fully validated, the TA will focus on one province in \neach pilot country, except for Thailand where previous projects have been conducted. The \nmethods that will be developed will only be applied on paddy rice crop during the rainy season \nas a main crop using SAR and other satellite-based data with ground observation data. For \nThailand, several provinces will be selected as pilot projects and both a crop model and ground \nobservation data combined with satellite-based SAR and other data will be applied to estimate \nrice crop area and production. The pilot provinces will be selected in consultation with the \nrespective implementing agencies using the following criteria: substantial contiguous paddy rice \narea, and the extent of contribution to the country\u2019s rice production. \n \n12.  For each pilot country, the designated implementing agency will be responsible for \nadapting and applying the methods that will be explored. The methods that will be studied \ninvolve SAR and optical satellite data that are freely accessible. The choice of which method to \nadopt will be based on the robustness of the data given all types of weather conditions. For \nexample, it is known that the application of optical data is fairly limited under cloudy conditions \nin which good temporal and spatial resolutions may not be fully achieved. Application programs \nthat can interpret satellite data to distinguish rice crops and construct rice area maps, assess \nrice crop growth conditions, and provide early warning indicators of rice crop damage will be \ndeveloped  and  customized  according to  the four  pilot  countries\u2019 meteorological  conditions. \nSelected archived data will be used to test the application programs that will be developed in the \nfirst year. These archived data will also be used in the hands-on training programs that will be \nconducted for selected staff of implementing agencies. \n \n13.  Intensive  training  programs  will  be  conducted  for  counterpart  staff  of  implementing \nagencies, who will also work closely with the project team in (i) customizing the software \napplications so that these are integrated into existing systems of implementing agencies and, if \nneeded,  include  interfaces  that  use  the  national  language;  and  (ii)  putting  the  software \napplications into production. Field surveys in the pilot provinces using rice crop cutting will be \nconducted  to  validate  the  results  of  the  methods  being  studied.  Training  for  field  survey \npersonnel will be conducted prior to the field operations. Workshops on the results of the field \nsurveys will be held to further improve both the systems applications and the field survey \nvalidation methods. \n \n14.   An online training program will be developed to promote the use of remote sensing for \nestimating crop area and forecasting production and to share the experiences of the four pilot \ncountries in adopting this technology. The online training program will help to cost-effectively \nexpand the user base of these methods. \n ", "4   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,639,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. JAXA will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of personnel cost, technical fees, and administration services. \nThe value of JAXA\u2019s contribution is estimated to account for 14.2% of the total TA cost. The \ngovernments of Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam  will provide salaries of \ncounterpart staff, office space, and administrative support. The value of government contribution \nis estimated to account for 10% of the total TA cost. The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency of this TA. The Development Indicators and Policy \nResearch Division will administer the technical assistance and will closely collaborate with all \nADB units that are working on related issues, including the Sustainable Infrastructure Division; \nEnvironment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division; Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nCore Agriculture Support Program;  and the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food Security \nCommunity of Practice. The implementing agencies in the pilot countries are the Center for \nStatistics  and  Information,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  Lao  PDR;  the  Bureau  of \nAgricultural  Statistics,  Department  of  Agriculture,  the  Philippines;  the  Office  of  Agricultural \nEconomics, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, and GISTDA, Thailand; and the Center for \nInformatics and Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Viet Nam. JAXA will \nbe ADB\u2019s technical adviser and development partner organization. GISTDA, having first applied \nthe method, will also provide technical support. The TA will be implemented for 26 months from \nJune 2013 to July 2015.   \n \n17.  JAXA is also working with the Sustainable Infrastructure Division of the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department on another project (footnote 2), and a similar agreement \nwill be drawn for this project between JAXA and ADB. JAXA will be the project technical adviser \nand has agreed to provide expertise in the following areas: (i) applying remote sensing using \nexisting rice crop application software in the Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam; \n(ii)  implementing  capacity  development  for  applying  remote  sensing;  and  (iii)  technical \nassistance in developing the online curriculum using remote sensing technology on agriculture \nand rural statistics. In addition, GISTDA in Thailand will provide technical advice for rice crop \narea and production estimation using SAR under the ongoing JAXA\u2013GISTDA collaboration. \n \n18.  The implementing agencies will be responsible for processing the satellite data using the \nsoftware applications that will be developed under the project so that pilot provincial crop area \nand production estimates can be generated. They will also undertake the field validation through \nthe crop-cutting method. They will assign counterpart staff who will be trained in (i) the use and \nmaintenance of the software applications so that this estimation method can be fully adopted, \nand (ii) implementing the field validation. The implementing agencies will closely coordinate with \nother bodies that comprise the national statistical system in the pilot countries to inform them of \nrelevant project results and online training programs and promote the use of remote sensing \ntechnology for compilation of official statistics. They will also be responsible for disseminating \nthe crop area and production estimates among policy makers and other concerned agencies. \n ", "  5 \nThe online training program will be hosted on the Community for Agriculture and Rural Statistics \nwebsite.4  \n \n19.  The  TA  will  require  96  person-months  of  consulting  services  (32  person-months \ninternational and 64 person-months national) to implement the TA components in the four pilot \ncountries. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A consulting firm will be engaged to \nprovide the services of a team of international consultants consisting of a team leader and \nsystems architecture specialist (5 person-months), systems architecture specialist (8 person-\nmonths), and two remote sensing specialists (total 13 person-months). For the selection of a \nmain consulting firm, the quality- and cost-based selection (90:10) method will be used because \nof the highly specialized skill requirements and experience to achieve expected outputs, and the \nfirm will be required to submit bio-data technical proposals. In addition, international individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged\u2014a  training  program  specialist  for  4  person-months  and  an \nagricultural statistician for 2 person-months. National remote sensing specialists in the four pilot \ncountries will also be engaged for 4 person-months each. Two national consultants assigned in \nADB headquarters will also be engaged (for 24 person-months each) to assist the ADB project \nteam in coordinating the project, organizing the training programs and workshops, and resolving \nand documenting technical issues. The consultants will work under the overall supervision of the \nADB project team with the technical support of JAXA. The terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of \nequipment will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). At \nthe end of the project, equipment purchased through the shopping method under the TA will be \nassigned to the concerned implementing agencies and TA outputs such as rice area maps, \nsoftware  application,  data,  and  information  will  be  turned  over  to  the  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment\u2019s GMS Environment Operations Center, the information clearing house for GMS \nworking group on environment and related sectors. \n \nIV.
