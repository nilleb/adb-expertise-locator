To  support  Tajikistan's  economic  development  by  exploiting  the  country\u2019s  abundant \nhydropower and other energy resources, the Government needs help to prepare a realistic and \naffordable energy sector development program that will ensure the optimal use of the country's \nscarce capital and the efficient development of the sector. This is a follow-up of earlier Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA),1 which recommended development of \nhydropower  as  the  main  domestic  energy  resource.  At  the  request  of  the  Government  of \nTajikistan, TA for developing a hydropower development strategy was included in ADB\u2019s 2002 \nTA program. The TA2 will identify export markets for the hydropower, develop a least-cost \ninvestment  program,  and  provide  a  framework  for  coordinating  external  assistance  for  the \nsector, including the timing and priority of the proposed hydropower development projects, \nRogun and Sangtuda, and other investments. The Fact-Finding Mission in August 2002 reached \nan understanding with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, approach, cost estimates, \nand implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Tajikistan has vast hydropower potential and less than 10% of its potential of 40,000 \nmegawatt (MW) is currently used. More than 90% of the electricity produced in Tajikistan comes \nfrom  hydropower  that  uses  melt  water  from  snow  in  summer  around  the  Pamir  and  Fan \nmountain regions as key input. In winter, however, hydropower generation depends on storage \nwater in reservoirs, and when storage level is low, the country has to rely on imported oil, gas, \nand coal and imported energy. Tajikistan imports electricity from Uzbekistan from January until \nApril  every  year  because  of  the  limited  storage  capacity  in  reservoirs  despite  its  ample \ngeneration capacity. In 2000, Tajikistan faced a major electricity shortage resulting from limited \nrainfall, and had to import a large amount of electricity from neighboring Uzbekistan. If there is \nan excess rainfall, and no demand for electricity, surplus water i.e., water above the safe \nreservoir storage level has to be spilled. Such spillage represents net economic loss. Nurek, the \nlargest hydropower plant (with a capacity of 3,000 MW), spills water every summer as there is \nno demand for export for the excess electricity. Nurek has insufficient storage and the excess \nwater in summer cannot be stored to supply the domestic winter deficit of about 4,000 gigawatt-\nhour (GWh). \n \n3.  Rehabilitation of existing power plant, transmission, and distribution assets are essential \nto maintain operations of the electricity system, which has been the focus of ADB\u2019s investment \nin the energy sector of Tajikistan. The state-owned electricity industry is unable to generate \nenough cash to invest in the rehabilitation work as electricity revenue barely meets operating \ncosts, and collections are still poor. The Government has increased tariffs quite significantly \nover the last few years to meet the ADB loan3 covenants, but as a result of the devaluation of \nthe Tajik somoni, tariff increases in United States dollar term still lag the levels required by the \ncovenants. Export of relatively cheaper hydroelectricity to the neighboring countries is more \nprofitable as export prices are higher than the domestic prices; thus revenue from a sustainable \nlevel of export is key for investments in new hydropower resources. The Government needs a \nplan for hydropower development to address the electricity deficit in winter and export potential \nfor surplus hydropower in summer. The plan should be least cost, affordable, and should \nmaximize export revenue from hydroelectricity.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Power Sector Development Project. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in February 2002. \n3 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of \nTajikistan for the Power Rehabilitation Project. Manila.  \n ", "2 \n4.  The  low  electricity  tariff  encourages  inefficient  use  of  electricity.  Tajikistan  imports \nexpensive electricity to meet early morning and late evening peak load in winter. The load can \nbe significantly reduced if customers were conscious of their energy use. Appliances used in \nhouseholds are old and consume much more electricity than newer energy efficient appliances. \nPart of the evening peak load is also attributed to residential and commercial lighting, which can \nbe significantly reduced if efficient lights (e. g., compact fluorescent lights) were used. Energy \ncan be conserved by improving technical efficiency and reducing waste by consumers. The \nGovernment has addressed these issues by creating a new law on energy efficiency with a view \nto incorporate demand management options in planning to reduce overall cost of electricity \ngeneration and expansion and rehabilitation of the network. \n \n5.  Tajikistan\u2019s  electricity  network  effectively  has  three  separate  grids.  The  northern \n(Leninabad region), southern (main grid), and small Gorno Badakhshan grid make up the \nnational electricity grid. Because the network is only partly interconnected, system operators \nface increasing difficulty in balancing supply and demand while maintaining sufficient reserve. \nThe industries around Khujand, which comprise most of the nonaluminum related industries in \nTajikistan,  contribute  to  a  net  deficit  of  200  MW.  This  deficit  in  the  north  is  supplied  by \nUzbekistan in return for exports from the southern grid, as the northern and the southern grids \nare linked only through Uzbekistan. Tajikistan suffers financially from this electricity trade, as the \nnational import prices are higher than export prices, although, in most cases, the amount of \nelectricity imported equals that exported, and the net result is a simple balance. This inequality \nresults from trading peak power for base load power and providing ancillary services to support \nload flow without any charge. Before constructing a transmission link connecting the two grids, \nthe Government should consider the costs and the benefits of (i) a transmission link between \nthe north and south of the country, (ii) a new thermal power station in the northern region, and \n(iii) a long-term supply agreement with Uzbekistan.  \n \n6.  Central  planners  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  were  committed  to  develop  the \nhydropower resources of Tajikistan for supplying the region and built large dams and power \nstations. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, two projects remained unfinished. These large \ninvestments may only be viable with firm commitments from neighboring countries to import \nelectricity at a reasonable price. Construction of Rogun hydropower is one of the incomplete \nprojects designed for regional benefits. The current plan for Rogun hydropower is to build a \npreliminary dam 220 meters (m) height with two 440 MW generators. In a second phase the \ndam height will be increased to 330 m, making it one of the highest dam in the world, with \ngeneration capacity of 3,600 MW. Rogun is upstream of the 3,000 MW Nurek hydropower \nstation, hence completion of the Rogun dam would allow better regulation of water flow to all \ndownstream hydropower plants, including Nurek. The high siltation rate is a growing problem in \nthis  region  and  construction  of  Rogun  stage  1  will  protect  the  storage  capacity  of  Nurek \nreservoir from further siltation. Sangtudin hydropower plant, immediately downstream of Nurek, \nis being constructed and will operate as a run-of-river plant. It will have very limited storage and \nwill depend largely on releases from Nurek. The Government  is  currently unable to finance all \nof these projects and consideration has to be given to phasing them in. The Ministry of Energy \n(MOE) is responsible for energy sector planning, but lacks the capacity to carry out the least \ncost planning task independently. \n \n7.  Except for the deficit in winter, current generation capacity is enough to meet future \ndemand  without  substantial  investment  in  new  capacity.  Identified  and  committed  export \nmarkets will generate funding for new projects. Power sector reforms are also necessary to \ncommercialize  activities  and  improve  management  of  the  sector.  Current  Government \ninvestments need to be integrated and prioritized to maximize the value of the limited available \nresources. The Government\u2019s planning effort should change focus from self-sufficiency to an \n ", "    3 \nintegrated approach for demand and supply options with export of low cost hydropower to the \nneighboring countries.  \n \n8.  Tajikistan\u2019s electricity generation capacity that can not meet winter demand, lack of \ninterconnection between the north and south of the country, inefficient use of energy resources, \nand funding for huge, partly completed hydropower projects that were designed for regional \nsupply are the key challenges for the electricity industry of Tajikistan. Low cost hydropower for \nexport could expedite the pace of economic growth of Tajikistan. The TA will address these \nissues. \n \n9.  TA concept had full support of the donor community and was endorsed at an \u201cenergy \ndonors meeting\u201d in March 2002. No overlapping or ongoing World Bank or other activity exits in \nthis area. Recently, a World Bank team reviewed the investment needs of the two unfinished \nhydropower projects in a two week mission. The proposed TA will take an integrated approach \nto domestic and export demand, all candidate projects, and their required investments.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  TA\u2019s  objective  is  to  help  the  Government  prepare  a  hydropower  development \nstrategy.  The  strategy  will  identify  for  the  Tajikistan  energy  sector  the  optimal  energy \ndevelopment  program  that  will  meet  domestic  energy  requirements  and  realize  export \nopportunities given the energy resources available, existing power investments, and fiscal and \nother constraints. The strategy is expected to provide guidance to also other funding agencies \nand investors interested in the sector.  \n \n11.  The TA will (i) review all energy and power sector studies that have been completed and \ninteract  with  those  ongoing,  including  the  Government's  energy  policy  and  its  plans  for \nhydropower sector development; (ii) establish likely load forecasts for domestic and export \nmarkets for hydropower; (iii) consider new candidate projects, including phased construction of \nincomplete hydropower projects; (iv) undertake macroeconomic analysis to determine the fiscal \nconstraints of the Government and self-financing ability of Barki Tajik; (v) develop a least-cost \nhydropower development strategy, including identification of external financing and investment \npossibilities; and (vi) provide training in energy sector planning to enable the Government to \nupdate the strategy on a regular basis. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will take a consultative approach and build on the work of the Government and \nexternal agencies. Wide participation and consultation with the agencies, neighboring countries \nwith import potential, key stakeholders in the government, and large industrial customers will be \nthe general approach. Key activities will include a review of existing construction activities; \nanalysis of the current level of trade; quantification and assessment of the suitability of the \noperational guidelines for downstream irrigation and cross border water flow requirements; and \ncollection and analysis of information on potential energy resources in the country, ongoing \ninvestments in energy sector, and fiscal constraints. Most of the hydropower is in the Vaksh \nRiver cascade and the catchment is sparsely populated. The unfinished hydropower projects \nhave already addressed resettlement issues. This study pertains to the hydropower potential \nfrom the perspectives of least-cost supply planning, and the associated costs of resettlement \nand environmental issues will be factored into the analysis. The TA activities will be as follows:  \n \n ", "4 \n(i)  demand  forecast\u2015development  of  domestic  and  regional  electricity  sales \nforecast; \n \n(ii)  establish candidate projects\u2015identification of hydropower and other power \nsector projects, and for the hydropower projects, development of appropriate \nphasing for construction/completion; \n \n(iii)  least-cost plan\u2015optimization of the list of candidate projects, including demand-\nside options to maximize benefits within the limits of technical constraints; and  \n \n(iv)  financing constraints\u2015revision of the technically optimized plan: by applying \nexternal  borrowing  limits  and  self-funding  limits  select  projects  that  are \naffordable. \n \n13.  One key component of the TA will be to strengthen the energy sector planning capability \nof Tajikistan. A planning unit will be established within MOE and appropriate training and other \nmeasures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  the  planning  unit  is  able  to  update  the  hydropower \ndevelopment strategy annually with the changes in planning parameters.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is $720,000 equivalent, including foreign exchange of $560,000 \nand local currency of $160,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to finance \n$600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $40,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan (Appendix 2). The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will require 46 person-months of consulting services: 16 from international and \n30 from domestic consultants. The consulting team will comprise experts in power system \nanalysis and planning; hydrology, reservoir management, and energy economists; and water \nsystem planning. ADB will select and engage a firm using the quality-and-cost-based selection \nmethod and a simplified technical proposal in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants will be used. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MOE will assign a project leader and \ncounterpart staff to work with the consultant and will closely monitor the domestic consultants\u2019 \nwork in close coordination with ADB. The TA will be implemented during 6 months, starting in \nFebruary 2003 and ending in August 2003. A workshop in June 2003 will discuss the final list of \ncandidate projects before the least-cost plan is developed. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tajikistan for the Hydropower Development Strategy, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n   \n ", "  Appendix 1  5\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanism  Assumption and Risks \nGoals       \n       \nPromote economic  Improve adequacy and  Energy institutions\u2019  Government\u2019s ability to \ndevelopment and poverty  reliability  of power  annual reports.  provide counterpart \nreduction by satisfying  supply.     funding and attract \nelectricity demand and realizing      foreign investments to \nexport potential of hydropower  Increase export of    complete the large \nresources.   hydropower.   projects.  \n \nPurpose       \n       \nBetter satisfy domestic  Better-coordinated  Consultants\u2019 reports,  Effective coordination of \nelectricity demand and realize  external assistance for  review missions.  external aid and investor. \nexport potential of hydropower  the sector and prioritized     \nresources by coordinated  investments.
