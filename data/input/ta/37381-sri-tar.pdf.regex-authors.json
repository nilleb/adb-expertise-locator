In 2003, the Government of Sri Lanka requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nproject to provide basic water supply and sanitation services to disadvantaged small urban \ncenters and rural areas. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program \n(CSP)  2004\u20132008  for  Sri  Lanka  and  its  updates  include  provision  for  such  TA,  which  is \nproposed for ADB financing in 2006. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka from 11 to \n19 July 2006 and reached preliminary understanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.1 The TA \nsupports the Government in itsefforts to (i) promote regionally balanced development, and (ii) \n \nreduce poverty and promote equitable development. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic \npriorities as outlined in its CSP (2004\u20132008), emphasizing support for (i) promoting pro-poor \neconomic growth, (ii) advancing social development, and (iii) improving governance. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Sri Lanka\u2019s continued efforts to improve \nits development indicators have placed the country ahead of most other South Asian countries.2 \nNevertheless,  22.7%  of  all  Sri  Lankans  live  below  the  national  poverty  line.  Much  of  the \ncountry\u2019s economic activity and wealth is disproportionally concentrated in the western part of \nthe  country,  and  Sabaragamuwa  and  the  North-East  Provinces  remain  among  the  most \ndisadvantaged  in  terms  of  access  to  economic  opportunities,  education,  and  general \ninfrastructure. While recent reports3 indicate that the country is expected to meet Millennium \nDevelopment Goal target 10 by 2015 if adequate progress continues, major challenges include \nregional disparities and urban-rural differences, for example, between 1990 and 2002, access to \nimproved water sources increased from 91% to 99% in urban areas and from 62% to 72% in \nrural areas. Similarly, 75% of the urban population is served by piped water, but only 14% of the \nrural population benefits from such a service. The proportion of the urban population that had \naccess to improved sanitation increased from 89% to 98% during the same period, while rural \ncoverage rose from 64% to 89%. Differences among provinces are even more prominent,4 but \ncannot always be quantified. The provision of safe drinking water through the construction of \nnew schemes and the augmentation of existing ones represents a major milestone in the \nGovernment\u2019s New Development Strategy. Consequently, in line with the 2001 national policy \nfor rural water supply and sanitation, the Ministry of Urban Development and Water Supply \n(MUDWS) set a goal of providing access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation to all \ncitizens by 2010, whereas the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) 5 aims to \nprovide piped drinking water to 45% of the population by 2015. Supporting such goals and \ntargets by means of a comprehensive policy and a regulatory framework is essential.  \n \n3.  Policy and Regulatory Framework. Both the draft water supply and sanitation policy, \nfirst formulated in 2002, and the recently prepared draft national policy on sanitation and draft \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 September 2005.  \n2  In 2005, Sri Lanka ranked 93rd out of 177 countries on the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s human \ndevelopment index.  According to the index, Sri Lanka\u2019s urban population has remained approximately constant at \n21 to 22% of the total population for the past 10 years. Details are provided in Appendix 2. \n3  ADB. 2006. Asia Water Watch 2015. Manila; National Council for Economic Development. 2005. Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Country Report 2005: Sri Lanka. Colombo.  \n4  According to National Water Supply and Drainage Board statistics, in districts such as Mannar, Puttalam, and \nVavuniya, as few as 11.4%, 2.5%, and 6.7% of households, respectively, have piped water. \n5  NWSDB currently provides around 29% of the population with piped water, while about 10% of the population has \naccess to hand pumped tube wells. \n ", "2   \npolicy on rural sanitation, are expected to be submitted to the Cabinet before the end of 2006. \nThese policies provide the necessary framework needed for the sustainable operation and \nmanagement of sector-related assets. Even though commissioners were appointed soon after \nthe creation of the Public Utilities Commission in 2002, its functions in relation to regulating the \nwater sector have not been fully effected, partly because of delays in formulating and approving \nlaws pertaining to the water industry. In this regard, the Government has recently proposed \nrevising the existing legal framework to enable Public Utilities Commission to regulate service \nstandards, tariffs, and customer satisfaction.  \n \n4.  Water Quantity and Quality. Water resources are scarce, particularly in dry zone, low-\nlying areas of the country, where annual rainfall can be as little as 750 millimeters, creating high \ndependence on groundwater and on reservoir storage. Groundwater sources in such areas \noften contain unacceptable levels of fluoride or iron or are excessively saline and require \ntreatment prior to distribution. Water quality in irrigation tanks and canals can be poor from a \nmicrobiological  and/or  a  physico-chemical  perspective,  with  pollution  often  resulting  from \nupstream  activities  and  from  man-induced  and  livestock  activities  in  the  catchment  area. \nDespite  ongoing  efforts,  the  scope  for  improving  water  quality  remains  significant.  In \ncoordination  with  provincial  irrigation  departments,  this  should  include  improving  source \nprotection  and  catchment  management  and  enhancing  monitoring  at  treatment  sites  and \nthroughout transmission and delivery points. \n \n5.  Sewerage  and  Sanitation.  Throughout  the  country,  pour-flush  systems  are  rapidly \nreplacing dry toilets. While septic tanks and on-site sanitation systems are gradually being \nadopted, surface and groundwater resources, particularly around urban centers, are at risk of \nbacterial  contamination  from  effluent  leakages  from  poorly  constructed  and  maintained  pit \nlatrines and discharges from septic tanks and other disposal facilities. Except in a few areas in \nColombo,6 in Hikaduwa, and in the near future, possibly in Jaffna, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, Sri \nLanka has no areas covered by sewerage systems, and of those areas with such systems, \nColombo has only basic facilities for primary treatment of sewage. In Colombo, sewers are often \nsilted and in need of maintenance. In towns, storm water drainage facilities are generally in poor \ncondition, as they are rarely cleaned and rehabilitated, but the situation is even worse in poor \nand informal areas, because of the lack of overall planning, inadequate maintenance, and \nencroachment on drainage channels. Poor maintenance and rehabilitation are often associated \nwith insufficient allocation of financial resources.  \n \n6.  Operational Performance and Financial Management. NWSDB, through its corporate \nplan,7 aims to improve its operational and financial performance. 8 Continuous efforts have \nyielded such improvements as (i) annual increases in service connections that have averaged \n11% for the last 10 years, (ii) reductions in the number of staff per connection from a relatively \nhigh 27.60 staff per 1,000 connections in the 1980s to 8.92 in 2005, and (iii) introduction of a \ncomputerized  and  decentralized  billing  and  collection  system  with  an  average  collection \nefficiency of 97.6% over the past 10 years. However, the scope for further improvements \n                                                 \n6  NWSDB is responsible for the operation and maintenance of sewerage systems in Dehiwala and Kolonnawa, in \nseven housing schemes in Greater Colombo and two outside Colombo, and in three industrial promotion zones, or \nfor some 50,000 connections. \n7  NWSDB is in the process of preparing a revised corporate plan for the next 5 years.   \n8  Despite satisfactory performance up to 2002, NWSDB\u2019s financial performance has declined over the past 3 years. \nNWSDB\u2019s nationwide water tariff was last revised in March 2005. Continued tariff increases are necessary to \naccommodate, among other things, substantial levels of inflation. NWSDB aims to recover at least operation and \nmaintenance costs, debt-service costs, and depreciation. It derives about two thirds of its revenues in Greater \nColombo, with an effective cross-subsidy of 5:1 from nondomestic to domestic water supplies. In addition, the \nintroduction of a sewerage tariff in 2006 remains critical, as sewerage activities contribute to total losses.  \n ", "  3\nremains significant. The main problems in relation to the delivery of water and sanitation include \nlow self-financing ratios, insufficient tariff recovery, and high production costs. Even for those \nwith access to piped water, delivery standards are often inadequate. Despite the consistent \nuseof bulk and household meters, nonrevenue water levels remain high (currently exceeding \n33%); water pressure is, in many cases, low; and supply is intermittent, which in itself increases \nnonrevenue water. Systems are almost invariably extended beyond their design capacities \nwhich further exacerbates operation and maintenance problems.9  \n \n7.  Community  Participation. In addition to NWSDB, local authorities, nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  are  responsible  for \noperating  a  number  of  smaller  schemes.10 Community  involvement  in  planning,  design, \nimplementation, and operation and maintenance, often facilitated by NGOs, has increased \nschemes\u2019 sustainability. However, if long-term sustainability is to be secured, critical activities to \nbe  institutionalized  include  (i)  introducing  a  suitable  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  (ii) \nproviding communities with access to credit and resources for maintenance and repairs, and (iii) \norganizing replicable financial and accounting capacity development programs for CBOs.  \n \n8.  Lessons. Previous projects (Supplementary Appendix A) have highlighted the need to (i) \nincorporate greater consultation, participatory processes, and local government involvement; (ii) \navoid conflicts among water users and secure adequate rights; (iii) conduct adequate costing, \nminimizing  inaccuracies  in  cost  estimates  that  may  lead  to  significant  cost  overruns;  (iv) \nincrease water and sewerage tariffs on an annual basis, taking inflation and tariff objectives into \nconsideration; (v) promote sustainable water resource development and establish frameworks \nfor water resource management; and (vii) develop capacity targeting all levels of influence.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of this project preparatory TA will be to facilitate sustainable development in \ndisadvantaged districts in Sri Lanka. Its outcome will be to improve basic water supply and \nsanitation infrastructure and services in dry zone districts of Sri Lanka. Project preparatory TA \noutputs will consist of (i) a feasibility study suitable for ADB financing that emphasizes poverty \nreduction  and  responds  to  locally  expressed  needs  regarding  priority  water  supply  and \nsanitation  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  capacity  development  assistance  for  institutionalizing \nmechanisms for sustainable community-based infrastructure development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  While keeping in line with integrated assistance to urban and rural areas, the TA will \nemphasize the importance of targeting those areas in the North-East and North West Provinces \nof Sri Lanka with the most acute shortages of drinking water and sanitation services and \nfacilities.  In  addition,  it  will  also  consider  opportunities  in  rural  areas  in  the  North  Central \n                                                 \n9  This is the case in several towns in the North-East and North West Provinces. In Mannar, where water supply is \nlimited to 10 divisions, the population receives less than 3 hours of water a day and the system experiences \nfrequent breakdowns. In Vavuniya, the current system is too small to meet demand, water supply is distributed for \nless than 4 hours per day, and less than 60% of the population is covered.   \n10 In rural areas, both MUDWS and NWSDB, with support from the World Bank and ADB, have extensively promoted \ncommunity participation in water and sanitation for more than a decade. Other donors working in this sector include \nthe Danish government (engaged in small towns in the Central Province and Colombo), the Japanese Government \n(supports programs through NWSDB and local authorities in Kandy), and the French and German governments.   \n ", "4   \nProvince.  While  supporting  inclusive  social  development  and  subsidiarity  principles  to \nstrengthen  local  centers,  the  TA  will  aim  to  increase  transparency,  complement  activities \nundertaken locally or by other assisting agencies, and involve stakeholders from early stages of \nthe  planning  and  design  process.  The  TA  will  seek  local  government  and  community \nparticipation and ensure that the design of the ensuing Project has an integrated approach, and \nalso draws all actors into the upgrading process in a way that validates and strengthens them. \n \n11.  The TA will consist of two components. Component 1, which will focus on preparing a \ncomprehensive feasibility study, will be implemented in two phases. Phase I will consist of a \ndetailed evaluation of the water supply and sanitation sector, and will (i) collect and review basic \nplanning data, capabilities, and resources for development in four urban centers,11 with an \nemphasis on more deprived areas; (ii) evaluate sample ADB subprojects and determine lessons \nlearned; (iii) initiate a socioeconomic assessment in identified target areas; (iv) map and analyze \npoverty data, the incidence of waterborne diseases, and the concentration of minority and \ndisadvantaged groups; (v) undertake engineering field surveys and mapping to ascertain the \ncondition of basic infrastructure and amenities, including collecting data on water and sanitation \nfacilities; and (vi) identify priority urban and rural areas based on needs for improved coverage \nand determine population projections and demand for services. Results will be analyzed and \ndiscussed at stakeholder consultations at the national and district levels. In phase II will (i) \nselect and refine project-specific investment components in both urban and rural areas; (ii) \ndevelop  technical  options  acceptable  to  all  stakeholders;  and  (iii)  conduct  economic  and \nfinancial  feasibility  studies,  environmental  and  social  studies,  and  other  documentation  as \nrequired by ADB guidelines. An institutional development and capacity-building program will \nsupport the prioritized infrastructure rehabilitation, augmentation, and development in selected \ntowns  and  will  include  a  detailed  nonrevenue  water  reduction  program.  In  addition  to \ninfrastructure development, the TA will consider health and hygiene education.  \n \n12.  Component  2  of  the  TA  will  help  NWSDB  institutionalize  postproject  completion \nsustainability measures in community-based schemes. For this purpose, the TA will support \nNWSDB  in  (i)  conducting  consultations  with  provincial  councils  and  local  authorities  and \ndeveloping understanding on the proposed by-laws enabling CBOs to exist as legal entities and \non the Development Fund for Water Supply and Sanitation, which will ensure CBOs\u2019 access to \ncredit facilities; and (ii) preparing and delivering a basic accounting, budgeting, and overall \nfinancial management training component for CBOs and CBOs\u2019 district offices. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,160,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance \n$870,000 equivalent, which will cover $750,000 equivalent under component 1, and $120,000 \nequivalent under component 2. The remaining $290,000 equivalent will be contributed by the \nGovernment and will include office accommodation and utilities, counterpart staff, taxes and \nduties, and workshop facilities. Component 1 of the TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, and component 2 will be financed \nunder the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector. Detailed cost estimates and the financing \nplan are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing Project. \n                                                 \n11  Districts are selected considering poverty and access to services data, mostly water and sanitation infrastructure. It \nis proposed that urban schemes in Mannar and Vavuniya in the North-East Province, and Chilaw and Puttalam in \nthe North West Province may be examined under the feasibility study. Districts where support for rural assistance \nis to be evaluated include Mannar, Puttalam and Vavuniya, and possibly Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. The \nstudy will consider similar beneficiary gains in rural and urban areas. Remote villages will be prioritized.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  NWSDB, under MUDWS, will be the executing agency and will (i) appoint a TA unit \ncoordinator, who will have a supportive, coordinating, and facilitating role; and (ii) provide office \nspace, furniture, equipment, and technical and support counterpart staff to the TA as necessary. \nOverall guidance for TA implementation will be provided by the TA Steering Committee, which \nwill  be  headed  by  the  secretary  of  MUDWS  and  will  include  senior  officials  from  other \ngovernment agencies, including the Ministry of Finance and Planning; NWSDB; the Ministry of \nLocal  Government;  the  Central  Environmental  Agency;  and  representatives  of  provincial \ngovernments, local authorities, aid agencies, and NGOs. The Steering Committee will first meet \nno later than 2 weeks after the start of the TA to confirm the coverage area and within 8 weeks \nof TA commencement to review the outcome of phase I of component 1. After that, the Steering \nCommittee will meet on a bimonthly basis or as frequently as required to review TA progress \nand provide direction, particularly on policy issues. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from March 2007 to November 2007. A team \nof international and national consultants will be selected and recruited through a firm using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method to provide a total of 74.5 person-months of consulting \nservices, 20.5 person-months of international consultants and 54 person-months of national \nconsultants, of which 33 person-months will be allocated to component 1 and 21 person-months \nwill support component 2. The international consultants will include experts in water supply and \nsanitation, economics, hydrology, sanitation and sewage treatment, organizational development \nand financial management, and environment. The national consultants will include experts in \nwater supply engineering, sanitation and sewerage, drainage, social development and gender \nissues,  resettlement,  financial  analysis,  and  environment  for  component  1  and  rural  water \nsupply, financial management and accounting, and community development for component 2.  \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants.  Outline terms of reference for TA consultants are presented in Appendix 4. \nADB\u2019s full technical proposal will be used in selecting consultants. Extensive workshops and \nconsultations will be conducted under both components of the TA. Office equipment financed by \nthe TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The consultants will \nsubmit  four  major  reports:  (i)  an  inception  report  no  later  than  4  weeks  following  the \ncommencement of services, (ii) an interim report within 3.5 months, (iii) a draft report at the end \nof the 7th month, and (iv) a final report within 4 weeks of receiving comments on the draft report \nfrom the Government and ADB. Both draft final and final reports will contain separate sections \nfor (i) the feasibility study, and (ii) the support for community development. The consultants will \nalso submit short monthly progress notes summarizing project TA activities, issues, constraints, \nand  proposed  solutions.  Tripartite  meetings  will  be  held  with  ADB  and  Government \nrepresentatives and the consultants to review the inception, midterm, and draft final reports and \nverify accomplishments. The consultants will translate the TA key deliverables to facilitate their \nreview by the Government and stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $120,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Sri \nLanka for preparing the Small Towns and Rural Arid Areas Water Supply and Sanitation Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORKa \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nSustainable development  Regional improvement in well-  United Nations  \u2022  Macroeconomic \nin disadvantaged dry zone  being as measured by the  Development Programme  stability \ndistricts in Sri Lanka  United Nations Development  Human Development Report  \u2022  Political stability and \nProgramme\u2019s human  for Sri Lanka  peace \ndevelopment and vulnerability     \nindexes   Census   \n   \nIncreased development of  Reports from aid agencies \neconomic capital as measured   \nby the employment index and  ADB country strategy and \nthe volume of trade  program and updates \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved basic water  Significant support for meeting  United Nations Children\u2019s  \u2022  Inflation is contained  \nsupply and sanitation  Millennium Development Goal  Fund reports on water  \u2022  All institutions, \ninfrastructure and services  10 targets in the North-East,  supply, sanitation, and  including local \nin dry zone districts of Sri  North West, and North Central  hygiene   governments, actively \nLanka   provinces    participate in the \n  United Nations Environment  planning and \nGreater than 95% compliance  Programme state of the  development process \nwith Government and World  environment reports  \u2022  Both the government \nHealth Organization standards    and beneficiary \nfor water distribution and  National and provincial  communities are fully \neffluent discharges in the  statistics on water supply  committed to long-term \nProject area  and sanitation  sustainability \n     \nMore than 90% of all Project  ADB   Risks \nrural schemes are sustainable   project completion report  \u2022  Not all key stakeholders \nand project audit report  participate in \nconsensus-building \nexercises  \n\u2022  Women and \ndisadvantaged groups \nare not involved in \nproject planning and \ndesign  \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

It has made major \nstrides in reducing maternal and infant mortality by means of an effective network of community health workers, \nliteracy levels are more than 90%, life expectancy is high (74 years), the net enrollment ratio in primary education is \ngreater than 95%, and immunization coverage is high (99%). Welfare levels are, however, not matched by high \nearnings and adequate livelihoods. While Sri Lanka\u2019s indicators compare favorably with those of countries with similar \nper capita incomes, Sri Lanka is unlikely to meet the first target of the Millennium Development Goals, a halving of \npoverty levels by 2015. Although survey data are not strictly comparable given the use of different methodologies and \nsample sizes, the percentage of poverty remains stubbornly at about 23%, with little improvement since 1991, and \n50.7% of the population is reported to be subsisting on less than $2 per day. While additional work needs to be carried \nout to determine the root causes of poverty in Sri Lanka, relatively low economic growth, low agricultural productivity, \nand increasing income inequality are likely to play a role.  \n \nFrom 1990 to 2002, access to improved water sources increased from 70% to 91% and to sanitation increased from \n68% to 78%. However, disparities in poverty levels and access to basic services and infrastructure are large. Poor \naccess to water supply and sanitation is often associated with poor health. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s country \nstrategy for Sri Lanka emphasizes the role of water supply, sanitation, and urban development infrastructure and the \nneed to target the poor to reduce both poverty and inequalities. Similarly, the Government\u2019s new development strategy \nemphasizes the importance of providing safe drinking water by constructing new schemes and augmenting existing \nones. Access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation, and improved environmental quality will reduce poor \ncommunities\u2019 vulnerability to environmental hazards. Improving the quantity and quality of domestic water supply and \nsanitation facilities will reduce morbidity and mortality, especially among young children. The availability of safe \ndrinking water supplies will also reduce the time needed to fetch water, which will benefit mainly women and girls. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? A multidimensional and multivariable poverty analysis will be required for \nthe Project. Although a good initial source, national and provincial survey data do not contain local\u2013level information, \nparticularly for the North-East Province. Data at the town and pradeshiya sabha level on population, literacy, health \nindicators, water and electricity availability, sanitation services, and so on will be used as part of the coverage \nselection criteria. Detailed survey data will also be required to estimate access by various groups to water and \nsanitation facilities, modes of delivery, quality of water sources, time spent by women and children collecting water, \ncosts of various services and infrastructure in the area, affordability by the most disadvantaged groups, and direct and \nindirect poverty impacts of the various services. \n \nThe detailed socioeconomic survey will be conducted for selected urban and rural areas where specific information on \nincomes and expenditures, demographic trends, gender issues, health, water and sanitation, and urban environment \nwill be determined. Sample data and secondary data sources will be used to extrapolate to the remaining Project \nareas. The findings of the socioeconomic baseline survey will be used to improve access by the poor to existing and \nnewly created infrastructure facilities and urban services. Participatory methods and innovative poverty assessment \ntechniques will be considered to identify the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nPreliminary stakeholder assessment was conducted during the Fact-Finding Mission for the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA). Stakeholders that will participate in the Project include representatives of the urban and \nrural poor (including women and different ethnic and religious groups), all tiers of government (including  the central \nand provincial governments and local authorities), community-based organizations, aid agencies, nongovernment \norganizations, and selected members of the private sector where relevant and appropriate,. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe participation strategy for the TA will focus on putting the urban and rural poor at the center of development by \nmeans of the Project\u2019s planning and design, and at a later stage, at the center of implementation, management, and \noperation and maintenance. The Project will involve communities from phase I by conducting a socioeconomic \nanalysis to include appreciative inquiry and rapid assessment methods, as well as community participation in \nidentifying and mapping current urban infrastructure and services. Workshops will be carried out with representatives \nof all stakeholder groups during all stages of project design. In rural areas, participatory project mechanisms will build \non self-help and will take local conditions into account. The existing structure of extended households provides natural \ngroupings that can be mobilized, strengthened, and used as a nucleus for community-based organizations with whom \npartnerships  will  be  built  and  to  whose  demands  the  Project  could  respond.  This  will  provide  for  grassroots \nparticipatory development. This approach ensures (i) the full participation by beneficiaries in project design and \nimplementation, leading to greater ownership; (ii) a process approach; (iii) the use of decentralized and localized \nimplementation arrangements along with capacity support to government and community groups in relation to \nimplementation and maintenance; and (iv) the use of more widely accepted technology. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Sri Lankan women have a relatively better status than women in many \nother developing and industrial countries, but have yet to achieve gender equality, and the scope for empowerment is \nsubstantial. The confluence of positive social policies, slow economic growth and the consequent persistent poverty \namong segments of the population, armed conflict, and engendered social norms have contributed to uneven \ndevelopment that impinges on women\u2019s quality of life. Women have major household responsibilities, including \nensuring the availability of water for household purposes. In the proposed project areas, women face various problems \nrelating to access to safe water and sanitation facilities because of the (i) lack of sources of water; (ii) deterioration of \nwater quality; and (iii) increased time required to obtain water, which reduces the time available for other activities. \nThe TA will specifically address gender issues, including participation by women in planning and design and in the \nidentification of constraints to and opportunities for women to actively contribute to implementation of the ensuing \nProject. A gender action plan for the Project will be prepared. Targeting of women requires a modified approach \nconsistent with local cultures and traditions in different parts of Sri Lanka. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No, it will be prepared as part of the TA \n \n \nE.

Phase I: Sector Review and Data Collection (1\u20132 months)  \n2.  Shortfalls,  Constraints,  and  Lessons.  The  team  will  review  and  analyze  existing \nstudies, reports, urban data, and related information, including lessons from past water supply \nand sanitation and urban development projects in Sri Lanka. The team will also review the \nexperience of projects assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other agencies, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community-based organizations (CBOs). To do this \naccurately, the team will conduct a preliminary evaluation study of around 15 to 20 small \nschemes (including both rural and urban centers) executed by ADB in selected or adjacent \nprovinces. The  team  will  share  lessons  with  central  and  provincial  governments  and local \nauthorities, as well as with representatives of citizen groups.  \n \n3.  Data Collection on Infrastructure and Service Delivery. The team will undertake the \nfollowing tasks: \n(i)  Assess the total financial envelope available for the sector, including resources in \ncentral and provincial government and donor pipelines.  \n(ii)  Collect and assess community data on general affordability and willingness to \npay for water supply and sanitation.  \n(iii)  Describe, map, and quantify the condition of basic amenities and services in \nurban and rural areas, highlighting needs and deficiencies in the water supply, \nsanitation, sewerage and sewage treatment, and drainage subsectors.1  \n(iv)  Discuss managerial and administrative arrangements in existing urban and rural \nschemes.  \n(v)  Examine the current environmental situation and the severity of potential health \nproblems caused by a lack of access to basic infrastructure.  \n(vi)  Conduct  an  inventory  of,  and  critically  review,  all  relevant  initiatives  for \ninfrastructure development, studies, plans and programs, and public and private \nsector proposals.  \n(vii)  Describe existing relevant operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures, tariffs, \nand status of billing and collection for the selected subsectors. The consultant will \nalso conduct a capacity assessment for local authorities in the proposed project \narea  and  seek  ways  to  identify  areas  of  responsibility  under  the  project \npreparatory TA (and potentially ensuing Project) for provincial councils and local \nauthorities.      \n \n2.  Phase II: Detailed Feasibility Study (5\u20136 months) \n4.  Project Design. The consultant will prepare a preliminary engineering design for all four \nproject  towns  and  three  sample  subprojects  in  rural  areas2 and  will  undertake  detailed \n                                                 \n1 Specific reference will be made to problems affecting existing distribution systems, leaks, water pressure, water \nfrequency, materials used, and system adequacy and efficiency. \n2  This component will take full coverage and equitable distribution into account. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \nsubproject preparation activities, including an analysis of suitable technical options acceptable \nto  communities.3 Bearing  integrated  water  resource  management  principles  in  mind,  the \nconsultant will undertake the following:  \n(i)   Screen all viable technical options and complete the technical design for selected \nleast-cost water supply and sanitation, sewerage, wastewater treatment, and \ndrainage options in consultation with stakeholders and local communities.4  \n(ii)   Conduct a physical reconnaissance of underground and surface water supplies, \nincluding  (a)  testing  and  basic  modeling  of  water  table  replenishment  to \ndetermine scheme sustainability, (b) assessing surface water resources suitable \nfor water extraction (this should include a historical evaluation of the source and \nof flow fluctuations throughout the year, an analysis of any existing upstream and \ndownstream uses, and a hydrological model to determine maximum extractable \nwater), and (c) analyzing water quality for proposed options in each town and \nsample rural subprojects.5  \n(iii)   Discuss the technical viability of the various proposed options for each project \nsubcomponent  and  demonstrate  that  they  are  the  least-cost  option  under  a \ncombined system approach.  \n(iv)   Develop a catchment program for improved water quality in consultation with \nrepresentatives from provincial irrigation departments containing (a) guidelines \nfor implementing source protection measures; and (b) a specific action plan for \nimplementation in all towns under the Project, including community awareness.  \n(v)   Prepare an integrated and comprehensive program for reducing nonrevenue6 \nwater, taking into consideration capacity for local and national implementation. \n(vi)   Assess the impact of wastewater collection and treatment on the water quality of \nreceiving watercourses before and after project construction.  \n(vii)   Assess the adequacy of on-site and off-site wastewater treatment options to \naccommodate incremental amounts of wastewater.  \n(viii)   Review  current  approaches  and  develop  an  outline  strategy  for  proposed \nhygiene education and water and environmental monitoring systems.  \n(ix)   Review existing O&M options and, if necessary, prepare a revised strategy for \ncommunity implementation of rural schemes, including technical procedures to \nensure  efficiency  and  sustainability  and  proper  financial,  accounting,  and \nmanagerial arrangements for O&M.  \n(x)   Review and/or define design criteria and standards.  \n(xi)   Outline  designs;  arrangements  for  construction  staging,  implementation,  and \ntendering; major civil works schedules; staffing requirements; and methods for \nselecting  appropriate  equipment,  including  maintenance  and  inspection  of \nsubcomponents.  \n                                                 \n3  The modality of the ensuing investment is expected to be a Project with a rural sector-like component. \n4  The selected least-cost options should also be environmentally and socially acceptable. \n5  Tests will include assessing levels of fluoride, iron, and manganese and the extent of salinity, bacteriological \ncontamination, blue-green algae, and so on, as deemed necessary. The results will be compared with national \nquality standards and World Health Organization standards for drinking water and appropriate treatment to comply \nwith the standards will be recommended. In particular, the origin of contamination will differentiate between source \nand distribution, as this might result from intermittent supply.  \n6  Overall, factors that have contributed to the practice of discontinuous supply include (i) rapid growth in population \nand water demand (and in some areas, particularly in the dry zone, shortage of water); (ii) inadequate water \ncharges (and in some instances collection mechanisms) leading to insufficient revenues to repair, maintain and \nreplace  infrastructure;  (iii)  intermittent  and  poor  quality  electricity  supply;  (iv)  inadequate  human  resource \ndevelopment,  including  training  in  modern  utility  operations;  and  (v)  inadequate  and/or  slow  demand \nresponsiveness and customer-orientation.

Project Costs. The consultants will use COSTAB or another suitable program and/or \nmethod to undertake the following tasks: \n(i)   Estimate project costs at market rates.  \n(ii)   Summarize the project costs estimated for land, civil works, equipment, materials, \nresettlement  (if  any),  environmental  monitoring  and  mitigation,  consulting \nservices,  taxes  and  duties,  project  management  and  capacity  building,  and \ninterest and other charges during construction.  \n(iii)   Present procurement contract packages, clearly indicating the packages to be \nfinanced in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n(iv)   Prepare detailed financing and disbursement plans.  \n \n7.  Financial and Economic Analyses. The consultants will conduct project economic and \nfinancial analyses in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements.7 To this end, they will undertake the \nfollowing activities: \n(i)   Describe the macroeconomic and sector context.  \n(ii)   Update water demand and wastewater discharge data and calculate projections \nfor various end user groups, e.g., groups using treated effluent for irrigation.  \n(iii)   Assess project alternatives and confirm least-cost solutions.  \n(iv)   Review  cost-recovery  policies  and  tariffs  at  and  national  level  and  current \narrangements in each town.  \n(v)   Propose  cost-recovery  mechanisms  (including  necessary  institutional \narrangements) through user charges, taxes, and/or other techniques for O&M \nand recovery of initial investments,8 and a tariff structure for each subproject for \nmedium and long-term recovery, taking affordability, willingness to pay, water \nconservancy,  cross-subsidization,  and  full  cost-recovery  requirements  into \naccount.  \n(vi)   Estimate  the  detailed  economic  project  costs  for  selected  options,  applying \nappropriate disaggregations of costs, standard conversion factors, and shadow \nprices as required.  \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997.

Social  Safeguards.  The  consultants  will  ascertain  the  number  of  minorities  and \nvulnerable people and their socioeconomic status and assess the specific anticipated impact \nthat  the  Project  will  have  on  them  using,  among  other  documents,  the  checklist  for \ncategorization  of  indigenous  people  and  will,  if  necessary,  develop  indigenous  people \ndevelopment plans according to ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people.  \n \n13.  At an early stage of TA implementation, the consultant will apply ADB\u2019s resettlement \nchecklists to identify resettlement issues and ascertain the nature and extent of the Project\u2019s \nimpacts on affected households. Based on the assessment, the consultants will determine \nwhether any of the water and sanitation infrastructure will have involuntary resettlement impacts \nand, if this is the case, in accordance with ADB's involuntary resettlement policy and Operations \nManual on involuntary resettlement, prepare a resettlement plan based on subproject design in \neach town, including  \n(i)  reviewing and assessing key national policies, laws, and guidelines regarding \nland acquisition and compensation;  \n(ii)  identifying and enumerating people likely to be affected through a survey and/or \ncensus and preparing an asset inventory that identifies all types of losses;  \n(iii)  ascertaining  preferential  relocation  areas,  compensation,  and  livelihood \nrestoration through consultation with those who might be affected;  \n(iv)  establishing  an  entitlement  cutoff  date  and  estimating  the  requirements  for \nfinancial resources, comparing these with available resources;  \n(v)  providing options for relocating housing and other structures, including transfer to \nestablished new sites, options for livelihood restoration, and mechanisms for \naddressing grievances;  \n(vi)  defining  institutional  responsibilities  for  approving,  implementing,  managing, \nfinancing,  and  monitoring  the  resettlement  plan  along  with  implementation \nschedules, capacity building, financial plans and budgets, and a plan for internal \nand external monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement plan. \n \n14.  The consultants will use ADB's Handbook on Resettlement16 as a guide in resettlement \nplanning. For the rural component, which is envisaged may be a sector-like component, the \nconsultant  will  prepare  a  resettlement  framework  that  shall  be  consistent  with  the  urban \nresettlement plan or plans. \n                                                 \n16  1998. ADB. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila \n ", "  Appendix 4  19 \n \n \n15.  Environmental Assessment. The consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n(i)  Prepare an initial environmental examination and summary or an environmental \nimpact assessment and summary17 and an associated environmental monitoring \nplan  covering  each  of  the  project  towns  and  subcomponents,  as  well  as \nsimplified initial environmental examinations for three rural sample subprojects. \nThis will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Guidelines,18 as well as Sri Lanka\u2019s National Environmental Act \nand other environmental protection regulations.  \n(ii)  Assess  the  positive  and  negative  environmental  impacts  of  proposed  urban \nsocial infrastructure and services related to their location, design, construction, \nand O&M.  \n(iii)  Propose mitigation measures and develop a full environmental monitoring plan.  \n(iv)  Conduct consultations in line with ADB requirements.  \n(v)  Formulate  environmental  management  plans  for  environmentally  sensitive \nsubcomponents.  \n(vi)  Prepare an environmental assessment and review procedure framework for the \nrural component of the Project. \n \n17.  Consultations and Consensus Building. To ensure community participation from the \nplanning and design stages and enhanced ownership, the consultants will carry out public \nconsultations in selected towns and rural areas. They will conduct stakeholder workshops at the \nnational, provincial, district, and town levels throughout the various stages of the Project.  See \nSupplementary Appendix B for proposed approach to consensus building.   \n \nB.  Component  2:  Developing  Institutional  Support  for  Sustainable  Water  Supply \nCommunity-Based Management \n20.  NWSDB\u2019s Rural Water Supply Unit has initiated a program of activities that will allow \nCBOs  to  access  (i)  technical  assistance,  and  (ii)  credit  sources  for  essential  O&M  and \nrehabilitation of rural schemes developed under this Project or other projects. The support \nprovided under this component will allow piloting of the program and replication under the \nProject potentially ensuing from this project preparatory TA.  \n \n21.  Introducing By-Laws Relating to the Management of Rural Water Supply CBOs. \nThe lack of recognition of CBOs within Sri Lanka\u2019s legal framework was identified as one of the \nproblems for effective community management of water supply and sanitation facilities. Based \non  studies  prepared  with  United  Nations  Development  Programme  assistance  under  the \nNational Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Facilitation Programme, by-laws for pradesiya \nsabhas and local authorities19 were formulated to enable CBOs to operate as service providers. \nIn conformity with the 2001 national policy for rural water supply and sanitation and pertinent \nmanuals, NWSDB has prepared draft by-laws and resolutions relating to the management of \nrural water supply by CBOs. Such by-laws empower CBOs to create, carry out, maintain, and \ncontrol small semi-urban and rural water supply schemes and widen their opportunities for \n                                                 \n17  The need for an environmental impact assessment will be particularly relevant if water is to be sourced from an \nenvironmentally protected or sensitive area, as may be the case in Mannar if water is to be extracted from the \nGiant\u2019s Tank.  \n18  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n19  It is proposed for this to be framed in terms of provisions made in the Local Authorities (Standard By-Laws) Act No. \n6 of 152 and Pradesiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 187.   \n ", "20  Appendix 4 \n \naccess to funding capital for new facilities. Unfortunately, to date only one provincial council has \nadopted such by-laws.20 The consultant will undertake the following tasks:  \n(i)  Review by-laws of concern and associated legal documentation.  \n(ii)  Support NWSDB in organizing and conducting workshop sessions with each of \nthe remaining provincial councils.  \n(iii)  Facilitate dialogue with provincial councils and local authorities and address their \nconcerns.  \n(iv)  Prepare educational materials outlining major advantages and implications of by-\nlaws and ensure their distribution. \n \n23.  Operationalizing the Water Supply Development Fund for CBOs. The long-term \nsustainability and successful introduction of water and sanitation schemes implies access to \nfinancing in case of emergency rehabilitation, expansion, and development. While schemes \nhave been handed over to CBOs for O&M and general management, and CBOs also engage in \nfee collection, the Government retains ownership of the assets. CBOs have restricted access to \nfinancing sources and their lack of collateral limits their access to banking facilities. NWSDB, in \ncoordination with the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Division of the Ministry of Urban \nDevelopment and Water Supply, has completed the preliminary design of the Water Supply \nDevelopment Fund for CBOs and piloted the creation of the Community-Based Organizations \nCredit Trust Board, a fund proposed to be managed by Sri Lanka\u2019s provincial councils, in the \nNorth  Central  Province.  Given  these  circumstances,  the  consultant  will  provide  support  to \nNWSDB by  \n(i)  reviewing the status of implementation of the Water Development Fund for CBOs \nin the North Central Province and provide recommendations;  \n(ii)  preparing educational materials on the subject and user-friendly manuals and \ninstructions for CBOs;  \n(iii)  translating documents into Sinhalese and Tamil;  \n(iv)  conducting training and explanatory sessions with all provincial councils and \nselected local authorities and/or pradesiya sabha representatives, CBO districts, \nand CBOs in those councils agreeing to adopt the funds.  \n \n25.  Institutionalizing  Financial  Management  and  Accounting  for  Small  Scheme \nOperators. Major findings resulting from one of ADB\u2019s regional technical assistances21 indicate \ndifficulties encountered by a significant number of CBOs in relation to financial management \nand accounting.  To address this, the consultant will engage in the following activities:  \n(i)  Review experience from ongoing projects and material developed under previous \nassistance.  \n(ii)  Develop  simple  and  efficient  budgeting  methods  for  CBOs  and  associated \ntraining materials.  \n(iii)  Develop simple accounting and auditing methods and mechanisms for CBOs and \nassociated training materials.  \n(iv)  Conduct training in at least 10 districts, with a focus on training district-level \nsupport units and (in the presence of district-level officers) pradesiya sabha and \nCBO representatives.  \n \n                                                 \n20  As part of the legal requirements necessary to effect the By-laws, approval from the Provincial Minister in charge if \nLocal Government must be obtained and published in The Gazette, as should be associated a Pradesiya Sabha \nresolution.      \n21  ADB. 2004.
