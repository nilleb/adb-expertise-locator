INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will produce a study on low-carbon, climate-resilient urban \ninfrastructure development options, costs, and benefits in developing member country (DMC) \ncities or urban agglomerations with current populations of 750,000 or more. For six selected \n\u201carchetype\u201d cities, a master plan-level assessment of current and projected infrastructure needs \nby 2030 will be undertaken and the climate exposure and risk of these needs will be analyzed. \nThe TA will quantify the infrastructure financing needs of selected cities, including filling existing \ninfrastructure  gaps  and  projected  infrastructure  needs,  using  investment  in  low-carbon \ninfrastructure where feasible and climate-resilient infrastructure in all cases. The TA will identify \nappropriate financing mechanisms and structures to support the implementation of the identified \ninfrastructure. \n \n2.  By focusing on archetype cities or agglomerations that are representative of a larger \ngroup of cities in Asia and the Pacific and have demonstrated willingness to explore low-carbon \nand climate-resilient infrastructure alternatives, the TA will permit a quantification of financing \nneeds for the implementation of low-carbon, climate-resilient urban infrastructure in cities across \nthe region. Ultimately, the TA will facilitate the identification of opportunities and approaches to \nfinance  for  low-carbon,  climate-resilient  development  using  a  range  of  financial  sources, \nmechanisms, and structures.  \n \n3.  The TA is aligned with Strategy 2020, which identifies climate change as part of the \nbroader agenda of promoting environmentally sustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific.1 \nStrategy  2020  also  promotes  livable  cities  that  are  competitive,  socially  inclusive,  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable.  The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  states  that  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will continue to support DMCs in tackling climate change, which \nincludes  helping  DMCs  to  engage  with  and  access  various  sources  of  climate  finance.2 \nFurthermore, DMC policy makers attending various ADB events, such as the First Annual \nADAPT Asia Pacific Forum in 2012, Asia Low Emission Development Strategies Partnership \nWorkshop on Climate Finance, and the subregional launching of the Economics of Climate \nChange publications, have also requested that ADB support this type of initiative. 3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Many countries in developing Asia are projected to become major global economic \npowerhouses this century. The region is also fast becoming a major driver of greenhouse gas \nemissions worldwide, and at the same time is increasingly exposed to the risks of climate \nchange. However, significant opportunities exist to develop interventions for sustaining optimal \nlevels of low-carbon and climate-resilient developments that have not yet been locked or are still \nin  the  early  stages  of planning  and  implementation.  Developing  countries require massive \nadditional  investment  to  transition  to  a  low-carbon  and  climate-resilient  development  path. \nMitigation in developing countries could cost $140 billion\u2013$175 billion per year during 2010\u2013\n2030. Adaptation costs for developing countries in Asia and the Pacific during 2010\u20132050 are \nestimated at $40 billion per year. \n \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila \n2 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 December 2014. \n ", "2  \n5.  Currently, more than 40% of Asia\u2019s population resides in urban areas, and by 2050 two-\nthirds of Asia\u2019s population will be urban. More than 520 million vulnerable people across the \nregion are estimated to live in squalor in urban slums, with poor services. Urban areas account \nfor  60%\u201380%  of  DMC  energy  consumption  and  75%  of  carbon  emissions. They  are  also \nfrequently exposed to climate-related hazards, such as floods and storm surges.  \n \n6.  Given the urban growth expected in Asia, particularly of small and medium-sized cities, \nthere is a great deal of development and infrastructure yet to be built, so there are significant \nopportunities  for  low-carbon  growth  from  the  outset.  As  the  recent  study  of  the \nIntergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  Fifth  Assessment  Report  Working  Group  III \nemphasizes, cost effective, large-scale solutions to mitigation are not going to be achieved \nthrough individual sector or technology solutions, but rather through systemic and cross-sector \nmitigation  strategies.4 Not  only  have  cities  contributed  the  largest  share  of  the  world\u2019s \ngreenhouse gas emissions, they also concentrate many of the people most at risk from the \neffects of climate change. \n \n7.  In Asia, it is estimated that 138 out of the 193 cities with populations of 1 million\u20135 \nmillion are exposed to natural hazards, while 15 of 26 cities with populations of 5 million\u201310 \nmillion and 11 of 13 cities with populations greater than 10 million are also exposed, of which \nmany are coastal cities.5 In some DMCs, vulnerability is often increased because of informal \nsettlements, lack of adequate infrastructure, and limited institutional capacity. High levels of \nvulnerability require adaptation strategies that focus on resilience to acute as well as chronic \nclimate  impacts.  An  analysis  of  climate  change  plans  on  sectors relevant  to  infrastructure \ninvestments conducted by the Cities Development Initiative in Asia (CDIA) revealed that, \u201c79% \ninclude energy supply and distribution followed by buildings and water services (59%), planning \nand urban land use (48%), transport (48%), flood protection (41%), outdoor lighting (31%), and \nwaste management (24%)\u201d Most strikingly, the same study adds that, \u201cnone of the city climate \nchange plans analyzed provided data on financial investments needed to implement the plan or \nfor the infrastructure investments\u201d.6 \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n8.  Given the continuing evolution of the climate finance architecture, DMC cities in Asia and \nthe  Pacific  must  develop  strategic  approaches  to  climate  compatible  urban  infrastructure \ninvestment. The TA will help to fill knowledge gaps with regard to both city-level investment \nneeds as well as appropriate financing mechanisms for low carbon, climate resilient urban \ninfrastructure.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be an increase in investment in urban infrastructure using climate finance \nmechanisms in DMC cities. The outcome will be an improved information basis for project \ndesigns for large-scale low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure in DMC cities. This will \nhelp  decision  makers,  development  partners,  investors,  and  other  stakeholders  to  think \nstrategically about infrastructure needs and options as well as the sources and mechanisms to \naccess  financing  from  a  variety  of  financing  sources\u2014public  and  private,  domestic  and \n                                                \n4 IPCC. 2014.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The first output will be the classification of DMC cities according to key characteristics \nand the identification of the main climate risks, infrastructure options, and the six \u201carchetype\u201d \ncities, An online database cataloguing all cities in Asia and the Pacific with a population of more \nthan 750,000 classified into six main categories according to population size, geographical \nlocation (coastal or inland, temperate or tropical, etc.), projected demographic development by \n2030 and by 2050, and other relevant factors; and greenhouse gas emissions and climate \nvulnerabilities, and possible options for climate-resilient and low-carbon urban development will \nbe compiled.7 \n \n11.  The second output will be the identification of the needs and opportunities for large-scale \nimplementation of low-carbon, climate-resilient urban development in the six archetype cities. A \nreport containing six profiles, one for each archetype city, containing a macro-level description \nof (i) urban infrastructure gaps and expansion requirements to 2030, including an initial estimate \nof greenhouse gas emissions associated with development under a business-as-usual\u201d scenario; \n(ii) current and projected urban infrastructure climate exposure based on spatial climate change \nprojections for 2030, and for 2050; and (iii) current and projected opportunities to transition to \nlow-carbon infrastructure options by sector, including an initial estimate of greenhouse gas \nemissions associated with low-carbon development will be produced. \n \n12.  The third output will be the identification of financing models and mechanisms to address \ninvestment needs and capitalize on the identified opportunities in each archetype city. A report \ncontaining six profiles, one for each archetype city, will be compiled. The report will contain (i) a \nmacro-level estimate of the costs, benefits, and associated financing requirements of selected \nlow-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure investment options to 2030; (ii) an assessment of \noptions with regard to the financing models which may be developed or applied in order to \nmobilize the required financing for the identified options, including ADB financing; (iii) a basic \nfinancing model derived from (i) and (ii) above; and (iv) a description of possible strategies and \napproaches to (a) access financing sources, (b) mobilize the private sector, and (c) address \nexisting gaps in institutional and technical capacity to implement investments.  \n \n13.  The fourth output will be the identification of the costs and benefits associated with large-\nscale implementation of low-carbon, climate-resilient urban infrastructure in DMC cities by 2030. \nA report containing an indicative estimate of the costs and benefits of implementing low-carbon, \nclimate-resilient  urban  infrastructure  across  all  DMC  cities  with  a  population  greater  than \n750,000 (current) will be produced.  \n \n14.  The fifth output will be the development of a concept proposal to scale up investments in \nlow-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure in DMC cities. A report will be produced containing a \ndescription  of  options  for  clustering  investments  and  accompanying  financing  strategies  to \nachieve economies of scale and a globally significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions \n                                                \n7 The six archetype cities will include at least one city from a Group A or B Asian Development Fund-eligible country. \nBased on initial assessments, this would likely be Kathmandu, Nepal. Based on informal discussions with ADB \nPacific Department, the TA will also likely cover Suva, Fiji. \n \n ", "4  \nand urban climate vulnerability. The report should make recommendations for effective DMC \ncity access to new forms of climate finance, including from the Green Climate Fund. The report \nshould also describe potential roles for financing partnerships focused on accelerated scaling-\nup of investment and assistance to DMC cities.  \n \n15.  Data collection will include the review and analysis of existing literature, data inventories, \nand other resource materials, including national and city development plans, climate change \nplans and studies, greenhouse gas inventories, vulnerability assessments, estimates of urban \nfinancing needs, and other relevant sources. Key informant interviews may be conducted to \ntriangulate data collected and to corroborate TA findings. \n \n16.  The main assumption of the TA is that there are a large number of cities that are suitable \nfor large-scale implementation of low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure. Major risks are \nthat (i) DMC governments constrain the ability of city governments to access external financing; \n(ii)  the  lack  of  necessary  information  on  infrastructure  needs  and  climate  vulnerability  of \narchetype  cities  to  carry  out  assessments;  and  (iii)  delay  in  international  climate  change \nagreements required for the establishment of financing mechanisms which are accessible to \nDMC cities to pursue low-carbon, climate-resilient development. Risks will be partially offset \nthrough selection of cities so as to ensure availability of information needed for assessments.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will serve as the executing and implementing agency for the TA, with the Climate \nChange and Disaster Risk Management Unit of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment serving as the focal point. The implementation period of the TA will be from January \n2015 to February 2016.  \n \n19.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan for 2012\u20132020, which emphasizes \nintegrated  planning  to  catalyze  climate-friendly,  resilient,  inclusive,  and  environmentally \nsustainable urban development.8 The TA also supports ADB's Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational Plan, which features urban transport and climate change and energy efficiency as \nkey areas of intervention, and promotes integrated urban planning, land use planning, and lower \nemission transport solutions.9 \n \n20.  The  TA  will  draw  lessons  from  the  CDIA  that  ADB  has  jointly  established  with \ndevelopment partners. The CDIA continues to help Asian cities structure urban infrastructure \nprojects, including low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure. The TA will establish links with \nongoing ADB efforts to scale up climate-resilient investment in urban infrastructure, including \nthe  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership \nFacility, as well as relevant programs in regional departments, such as the Southeast Asia \nDepartment\u2019s Secondary Cities Development Program II (Green Cities) and the Central and \nWest Asia Department\u2019s Economics of Climate Change in Central and West Asia. The TA will \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2013. Urban Operational Plan. Manila. \n9 ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan.

The  TA  will  finance  consulting  services,  workshops,  and  report  preparation.  Target \narchetype cities will be proposed after discussions with regional departments, the Private Sector \nOperations Department, DMC authorities, and other stakeholders. The workshops serve as a \nplatform to present, validate, and consolidate insights regarding the interim and final results of \nthe TA. \n \n22.  The TA will require 29 person-months of international and 24 person-months of national \nindividual consultant inputs. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method,  based  on  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20,  and  simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAppendix 3 provides the outline terms and reference for the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nFinancing  Low-Carbon,  Climate-Resilient  Urban  Infrastructure  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                \n10 Possible partner research institutions and centers of excellence include the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, \nInternational Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, Institute for Social and Environmental Transition, and \nInstitute for Global Environmental Strategies.  \n ", "6  Appendix 2 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nInvestment in urban  Number of DMC cities  Mayors\u2019 reports and  DMCs are committed to \ninfrastructure using climate  employing climate finance  other documents  low-carbon growth and \nfinance mechanisms in  mechanisms for investment  published by DMC  building resilience to \nDMC cities increased  projects supported by ADB  cities  climate change \nand development partners     \nincreased (baseline: 0, by  DMC reports  Risks \n2020: 10)     \nDonor country and  Lack of international \ndevelopment partner  agreement on climate \nreports  change required to provide \n  financial incentive to DMC \nGreen Climate Fund  cities \nreports \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nInformation basis for  Project designs of  Communications from  City stakeholders are willing \nproject designs for large- investments by ADB and  ADB operations  to take a strategic long-term \nscale climate investment  development partners in at  departments, DMC  approach towards urban \nin low carbon and climate  least 2 of the 6 DMC cities  cities, development  transformation and \nresilient infrastructure in  incorporate climate financial  partners, donors, and  infrastructure finance. \nDMC cities improved  mechanisms identified in the  investors   \ncity profiles  National governments are \nsupportive of city efforts to \naccess finance from a \nvariety of sources.  \n \nLocal actors, especially \nfinancial institutions and the \nprivate sector, are willing to \nengage with cities \nregarding low-carbon and \nclimate-resilient \ninfrastructure. \n \nRisks \nCities are constrained in \ntheir capacity to access \nfinance because of \ninsufficient creditworthiness \nor other restrictions which \nlimit their capacity to \nengage with finance \nsources.  \n \nTechnical challenges of \nproposal formulation \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
