INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) agreed to implement policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Capacity to Address Climate Change for \nSmall and Medium-Sized City Development. The Government of the Republic of Korea will \nfinance the TA under the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. The TA \nconcept discussion was initiated with the NDRC in November 2009 and the TA consultation \nmission was fielded 29\u201330 April 2010. The TA concept paper was jointly developed and was \napproved by ADB on 28 May 2010. The objective, scope, implementation arrangements, and \nfinancing plan of the TA are reflected in this paper. The NDRC confirmation on the draft TA \nreport was obtained on 21 October 2010. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  It is estimated that the PRC\u2019s urban population, which was 575 million (43% of the total \npopulation) as of 2008, will reach 787 million (55% of the population) by 2020, and 1.038 billion \n(73% of the population) by 2050.2 The trend is projected to continue even when the total \npopulation hits its projected peak of 1.458 billion in 2030 (at which point it is estimated that \n1 billion  will  live  in  cities).3   New  city  development  is  being triggered by  urban  population \nexpansion. Cities with more than 1 million inhabitants will increase from 100 in 2007 to about \n220  by  2025,  while  even  more  small  and  medium-sized  urban  centers  will  emerge  to \naccommodate rural migrants.4 Although city expansion and the emergence of new cities can \nreduce poverty by improving access to urban services for rural migrants and the poor, it will put \npressure on the environment by increasing greenhouse gas emissions and air, water, and solid \nwaste pollution. Constructing additional infrastructure requires massive amounts of cement and \nsteel, which is responsible for large indirect greenhouse gas emissions during the production \nand transportation process. To illustrate the impact of rural\u2013urban migration, per capita energy \nconsumption in urban areas is considered 3.5 to 4 times higher than in rural areas in the PRC. \n \n3.  The Government of the PRC considers urbanization an opportunity to expand economic \ngrowth  while  promoting  pollution-free,  resource-efficient,  low-carbon  urban  development  to \nsupport a harmonious and prosperous society.5 Under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, \nthe government is committed to protecting the environment by reversing the prevailing trend of \nincreasing  energy  consumption  per  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  as  well  as  decreasing \nenvironmental pollution in the atmosphere (sulfur dioxide) and in surface water bodies (chemical \noxygen demand). In November 2009, the State Council announced a national target of reducing \nthe intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP from the 2005 level of 40%\u201345% by \n2020.6 While promoting energy efficiency and a green economy, PRC cities will boost their \ncapacities for climate change mitigation. In large cities, notable efforts are under way, such as \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 September 2010. \n2  United Nations (UN). 2010.

However, a knowledge gap hinders \nefforts in the PRC to promote low-carbon economic growth and develop small and medium-\nsized cities, where financial resources and capacities are more limited than in large cities.8 \nSince small and medium-sized city development is inevitable and is considered a main driver of \nthe PRC economy, it is vital to guide this development in a way that maximizes savings on \ncapital investments, while minimizes abatement costs of greenhouse gas reduction. \n \n4.  The TA is consistent with (i) ADB's country partnership strategy (CPS), 2008\u20132010 for \nthe PRC, which lists urban environmental improvement as a component of resource efficiency \nand environmental sustainability\u2014one of the four main pillars of the CPS; (ii) ADB's Strategy \n2020,  emphasizing  climate  change  and  livable  cities  as  the  main  components  of \nenvironmentally sustainable growth\u2014a core area of operation to achieve ADB's vision and new \nstrategic agenda; and (iii) ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy,  which supports greater use of energy-\nsaving  development,  reduced  use  of  nonrenewable  resources,  and  improved  urban \nmanagement as key elements to achieving sustainable urban development. 9 \n \n5.  The scope of the TA is consistent with the PRC's national long-term goal of building a \nharmonious  and  moderately  prosperous  society.  Resource-efficient  urban  development  is \nidentified as one of 11 core development areas for national economic and social development \nunder the Medium and Long-Term Science and Technology Development Plan, 2006\u20132020.10 \nThe  PRC's  National  Climate  Change  Program  (2007)  also  identified  challenges  such  as \ndecoupling economic growth (in terms of per capita GDP) and greenhouse gas emissions, and \nseeking innovative and sustainable development for the country. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  The  TA  will  assist  the  government's  effort  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  small  and \nmedium-sized  cities  to  address  climate  change  and  pursue  low-carbon  city  development \nthrough knowledge sharing. Drawing on national and international experiences\u2014especially from \nthe Republic of Korea, Japan, the United States, and European countries\u2014the objective of the \nTA is to design a national low-carbon development strategy and associated policy guidelines for \nsmall and medium-sized cities in the PRC. This will be implemented by \n \n(i)  reviewing  the  status  of  small  and  medium-sized  city  development  and  the \nenvironmental challenges they face, and identifying bottlenecks hindering urban \nmanagement;  \n(ii)  reviewing and analyzing national and international best policies and practices in \nurban  development  in  terms  of  promoting  (a)  efficient  urban  land  use  and \ntransport planning, (b) energy and resource use efficiency in  the residential, \n                                                \n7 C40  is  a  group  of  the  world's  largest  cities  committed  to  tackling  climate  change.

Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA is increased energy efficiency and decreased per GDP carbon \nemission in small and medium-sized cities in the PRC. The impact is fully supported by the TA \noutcome of improved capacity of the PRC government to guide low-carbon small and medium-\nsized city development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will comprise five outputs with corresponding activities as follows. \n \n(i)  Review of the status of small and medium-sized city development in the \nPRC. The successful delivery of this output will be ensured by implementing a \ndetailed baseline review and analysis of the PRC's urbanization trend, national \npolicy objectives, and the status of small and medium-sized city development in \nthe PRC. This analysis will enable the TA to define several paths to pursue low-\ncarbon  development  for  cities. 11 The  TA  will  (a)  review  the  PRC's  future \nurbanization trend and define \u201csmall and medium-sized city\u201d in the context of the \nPRC; (b) review national, regional, and local policies designed to influence small \nand medium-sized city development; (c) select two or three small and medium-\nsized PRC pilot cities to be the focus of critical literature reviews and surveys on \ntheir low-carbon development challenges.12 The focus of these surveys will be to \nidentify cities\u2019 challenges on (a) balanced social and economic development, (b) \nenvironmental improvement, and (c) reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n(ii)  Summary of national and international best practices. Some PRC cities take \ninnovative  approaches  to  urban  land  use  and  transport  planning,  energy \nconsumption and resource utilization. Cities in developed countries accumulate \nbest practices in urban land use and transport planning, resource utilization, and \nenergy use, and many of these best practices are useful models for low-carbon \ncity development in the PRC.13 The TA will review national and international \nexperiences in low-carbon policy and practices in three areas: (a) efficient urban \n                                                \n11 Cities can follow different low-carbon development paths, which will depend largely on urbanizing trend (e.g., \ncentralized, decentralized), cities\u2019 key sectoral developments (e.g., heavy and/or light industry-based, agriculture-\nbased) and local climatic characteristics (e.g., tropical, semiarid, temperate, continental). \n12  Selection criteria will be discussed and agreed among the NDRC, ADB, and the consultant team by considering \nvarious factors to determine low-carbon development paths for cities (footnote 11). \n1T3 h Seo mviee wbse set xpprraecstisceeds  haendre ipno laicriee st hionscleu doef  t(hi)e f ocro nusrbualtna nlat nadn du sdeo  annodt  ntreancsepsosrat rpilyla nrenpinrge,s ecanrtb tohno-sneeu otrfa Al DurBba\u2019sn  \nmdeemvbeleorpsm, eBnota ornd  Joef juD iIrselacntodr, sR, eMpaunblaicg eofm Keonret,a o; ra sntda fcfo, manpdac mt caityy  bpela pnrneinligm lienda rbyy  inlig nhat truarile t.r a nsit development in \nToyama, Japan; and Strasbourg, France; (ii) for urban energy saving, the solar city initiative in Daegu, Republic of \nKorea; and the code of promoting combined heat and power installation in Yokohama, Japan; and (iii) for resource \nefficiency, an urban mining project in Seoul, Republic of Korea; public participation in advanced municipal solid \nwaste source-separation in Minamata, Japan; and green building in Freiburg, Germany. \n ", "4   \nland  use  and  transport  planning;  (b)  energy  savings  in  the  residential, \ncommercial, and industrial sectors; and (c) resource efficiency in the residential, \ncommercial,  and  industrial  sectors.  The  review  will  also  include  ways  to \nimplement the identified best policies and practices, identify ways to potentially \ncut  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  estimate  the  investment  required  to \nimplement each policy and practice. The TA will produce a database of national \nand international best policies and practices on low-carbon small and medium-\nsized city development. \n \n(iii)  Knowledge-sharing  analysis.  There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  approach  for \nsupporting the development of low-carbon small and medium-sized cities. The \nTA will (a) analyze the applicability of best policies and practices to various PRC \ncities by considering urban trends, climate conditions, city economies, and social \nand cultural characteristics; (b) conduct a detailed analysis of the applicability of \nbest policies and practices to the pilot cites; (c) for each pilot city, calculate \npotential  savings  from  reduced  resource  consumption,  energy  use,  and \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and estimate the needed financial investment to \nimplement those policies and practices; and (d) refine installation requirements of \nbest policies and practices through the analysis of pilot cities. \n \n(iv)  National low-carbon city development strategies and policy guidelines. The \nTA will draft simple but concise national low-carbon small and medium-sized city \ndevelopment strategies and policy guidelines, in line with other national, regional, \nand local development policies and objectives. These documents will be finalized \nthrough consultations with relevant agencies and ministries in the PRC.  \n \n(v)  Capacity building and dissemination of TA findings. This TA output will be \nimplemented through the NDRC\u2013ADB knowledge sharing workshop on domestic \nand  international  best  practices  for  PRC  government  officials.  The  TA  will \ngenerate knowledge products on  national and international  best policies and \npractices for small and medium-sized city development, and will introduce PRC \ngovernment  officials  to  approaches  to  promoting  low-carbon  city  growth.  TA \noutputs will also be disseminated through a regional knowledge platform for \nsustainable urban development established under ADB TA for Establishing a \nRegional Knowledge Hub for Sustainable Urban Development.14 \n \n9.  The potential risks of TA implementation include (i) limited availability of information on \nnational best policies and practices from PRC cities, (ii) limited availability of information for pilot \ncities to implement detailed analysis on applicability of best policies and practices, potential \ngreenhouse  gas  emission  savings  and  necessary  financial  investment,  and  (iii)  a  lack  of \nwillingness  of  local  governments  to  follow  the  national  low-carbon  development  policy \nguidelines.  The  TA  will  mitigate  these  risks  through  careful  selection  of  pilot  cities,  close \ncommunication  with  the  NDRC  and  pilot  cities,  and  use  of  robust  scientific  approach  to \nsupplement the lacking information. \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2010.

The PRC urban hub website that is being developed under this TA was launched in October 2010. \n ", "      5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund,  and \nadministered by ADB. The government will provide $125,000 equivalent in in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The  NDRC  will  be  the  executing  agency. In-kind  contributions from the  NDRC  will \ninclude temporary office accommodation, counterpart staff, research assistance in conducting \nsurveys  and  collecting  data,  logistical  support  for  workshops,  and  knowledge  product \ndissemination. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months from February 2011 to June 2012 with a \ndraft final report to be submitted within 12 months after mobilization of the consultant. The \ndatabase  of  national  and  international  good  policies  and  practices  on  low-carbon  city \ndevelopment, and the national low-carbon small and medium-sized city development strategies \nand policy guidelines, will be completed by January 2012. The capacity building workshop will \nbe held by March 2012. The knowledge products are to be finalized and disseminated widely to \ninternational and national communities by June 2012. \n \n13.  The TA will require four international consultants for a total of 13 person-months and four \nnational consultants for a total of 20 person-months. Both international and national consultant \nteams will comprise specialists on environmental policy and management, urban land use and \ntransport planning, energy management, and resource management. The consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time) and all necessary equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The TA will \nengage relevant consultants on an individual basis because, for consultant selection, individual \nexperience and qualifications of consultants are the main requirements. The TA requires highly \nqualified  international  and  national  experts  in  the  field  of  urban  environmental  policy  and \nmanagement,  land  use  and  transport  planning,  energy  management,  and  resource \nmanagement. These experts will be required to demonstrate strong experience and familiarity in \nclimate change mitigation and policies for cities in the context of the PRC and Asia. Experienced \nand qualified candidates can be best engaged through individual consultant selection, rather \nthan through private firms. The NDRC and ADB will coordinate and communicate closely with \neach expert to ensure their collective performance as a team. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n14.
