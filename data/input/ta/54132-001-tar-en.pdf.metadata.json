INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help strengthen evidence-based \neconomic policy-making in Azerbaijan by improving the government\u2019s knowledge management \nsystem (KMS)1. The TA will also promote sustainable responses to the country\u2019s demand for \nknowledge products and services (KPS).  \n \n2.  The country knowledge plan under the country partnership strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan, \n2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) envisages the proposed TA as an important \nelement in improving ADB\u2019s knowledge work in Azerbaijan, in line with the country\u2019s upper middle-\nncome country (UMIC) status.2 The TA is included in the 2020 TA pipeline of ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Azerbaijan, 2020\u20132022.3 The TA project will be guided by the \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in particular operational priority 6.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Azerbaijan  has  undergone  a  significant  economic  transformation  since  it  regained \nindependence in 1991 and reached an UMIC status in 2009. The economy continues to rely \nheavily on hydrocarbon export revenues and, hence, remains vulnerable to external shocks. \nSince 2016, the government has been spending significant sums on reforms to accelerate \ndevelopment of the non-oil economy.5 However, these reforms have been slow to materialize \nbecause of frequent changes in policies, reversal of institutional decisions and weak capacity to \nmonitor the reform agenda. \n \n4.  Government KPS are typically not disseminated among agencies and are retained by \nindividual employees of government agencies. This leads to a loss of institutional memory when \nthe individuals who retain this knowledge leave a given agency. Resources must then be spent \nto regain that institutional knowledge.  Moreover, the existing and inadequate coordination of silos \nin government-produced KPS constrain knowledge sharing and  absorption in the public sector. \nTo inform development planning and improve policy-making, the government seeks to establish \nan integrated knowledge management framework that will enable systematic collection, storage, \nscreening, and use of KPS.6  \n \n5.  A lack of regulations to protect knowledge and an absence of a dedicated government \nagency to act as knowledge custodian further compromises the sustainability of government \nKPS.7 The need to quickly design a comprehensive response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n \n1 The TA first appeared in business opportunities section of ADB website on 27 October 2020. \n2  ADB. 2019.

For the preparation of feasibility \nassessments, detailed designs, and project-related capacity building, the country operations business plan envisages \n$15 million in knowledge support for strengthening infrastructure delivery through the Better Project Preparation \nProject Readiness Facility. \n4  ADB. 2019.

ADB provides targeted support to the State Statistics \nCommittee under the Data for Development regional TA project (TA 9356-REG). Several other development partners \nare also cooperating with the State Statistics Committee. \n7  Regular development partner coordination meetings attended by the Azerbaijan Resident Mission suggest a strong \ncase for the government to institute a KPS information management system.  \n ", "2 \n19) pandemic has further underlined the importance of establishing a sustainable government \nKMS. \n \n6.  There is a growing demand for ADB-generated KPS in Azerbaijan.8 The country sees ADB \nas uniquely placed to share knowledge and build links with public and private sector stakeholders \nin Asia and the Pacific. The country assistance program evaluation for Azerbaijan, 2011\u20132017 of \nADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department recommended that ADB carry out more analytical \nwork  on  non-oil  tradable  sectors  to  support  economic  diversification.9 The  CPS  envisions \nstrengthening ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge institution in Azerbaijan in line with its UMIC and \nresource-rich status. However, implementation of the CPS knowledge agenda is constrained by \n(i) the limited availability of ADB TA funding for KPS in Azerbaijan;10 (ii) ADB\u2019s lack of flexibility to \nrespond quickly to targeted TA requests for emerging priority reforms; and (iii) the government\u2019s \nlack of a proper knowledge management system.11 \n \n7.  Azerbaijan has started to position itself as a donor. In November 2019, the government \nannounced (i) pledges to the International Development Association ($5 million) and the 13th \nreplenishment of the Asian Development Fund ($2 million); and (ii) allocation of $2 million to the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development for delivery of knowledge and project \npreparatory work in Azerbaijan. In March 2020, Azerbaijan announced provision of $5 million to \nthe COVID-19 Fund of the World Health Organization. While Azerbaijan continues to be interested \nin receiving knowledge and advice, it has also started exporting knowledge. It shares expertise \non digitalization of government services under the Azerbaijan Service and Assessment Network \n(ASAN), and shares knowledge on sovereign wealth management under the State Oil Fund \nof Azerbaijan.12 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  efficiency  of  government  spending  on \neconomic reforms improved. The TA will have the following outcome: effectiveness of economic \npolicies improved.13 The planned outcome will be achieved through implementation of the outputs \ndescribed in paras. 9\u201310.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Country knowledge system improved. This output will support (i) preparation \nof a proposal to set up an integrated government KMS to store, search, share, disseminate, and \nevaluate  KPS;14 (ii)  development  of  a  proposals  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  institutional \n \n8  Among the KPS demand areas are economic diversification, climate change, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, \nwhich refers to a fusion of physical and digital technology and is set of highly disruptive technologies, such as artificial \nintelligence, robotics, blockchain and 3D printing that are transforming social, economic and political systems \n9  Independent Evaluation Department. 2018.

ASAN is under the State Agency on Civil Service and Social Innovations \nunder the President of Azerbaijan. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 ADB will add value by building an IT-based KMS in Azerbaijan. This will be ADB\u2019s first attempt at such a project in \nAzerbaijan by any development partner. \n ", "3 \nknowledge-management framework, including certain legal aspects;15 (iii) pilot testing the KMS in \none government agency to demonstrate its usefulness in formulating policies; and (iv) capacity \nbuilding in knowledge management for staff (designated \u201cknowledge custodians\u201d) of selected \ngovernment agencies. \n \n10.  Output 2: Knowledge delivery in Azerbaijan strengthened. This output will support (i) \n(i) extracting knowledge from completed and ongoing ADB operations in Azerbaijan to draw \nlessons and inform the directions for future operations in the country; (ii) supporting demand-\nbased knowledge work in the country to respond emerging priority reforms; (iii) development of a \nproposal on financing arrangements for knowledge-related work in Azerbaijan, drawing on the \nexperiences of ADB and other development partners in Azerbaijan, as well as their experiences \nin other UMICs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $380,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2.  \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office space and supplies, \nstaff time, information and data, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The  Azerbaijan  Resident  Mission  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  will \nadminister the  TA  in  coordination  with  the  Knowledge  Advisory  Services  Center  of  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The resident mission will ensure that \nconcerned sector divisions of the Central and West Asia Department and sector and thematic \ngroups of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department are involved from the \nidentification to the monitoring and supervision of the KPS delivery. \n \n14.
