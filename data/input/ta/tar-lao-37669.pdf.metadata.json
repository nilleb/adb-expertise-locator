The technical assistance (TA) is the outcome of ongoing efforts in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) to bring about gender equity in access to resources and \nparticipation in economic development.1 The Government requested the TA during a workshop \nto discuss potential areas TA using poverty funds.2 The Government of the Lao PDR is engaged \nin reforming land administration and titling.3 There are emerging concerns related to gender \nequity in the ongoing process of planning and allocation of land, forest, and water resources. \nThe Lao PDR is signatory to the Beijing Platform for Action, which highlights the importance of \ngender equality in the control of, and access to, productive resources. The Lao PDR ratified the \nConvention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1981. The \nConstitution provides for equal rights of women to land. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is \nresponsible for central land management, registration, issuance land titles, and leasing land. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is responsible for agriculture and forestland.4 \nThe provincial agriculture and forestry offices (PAFOs) and district agriculture and forestry \noffices (DAFOs) are responsible for land-use planning and land allocation for agricultural and \nforestlands. Implementation of the land-related laws is dispersed through a number of agencies, \nand the lack of capacity and coordination on issues of ethnicity, gender, and culture can lead to \nnegative  impacts  on  ethnic  minority  communities,  particularly  on  women.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has held discussions with the Government, civil society, and mass \norganizations, to determine the need for a comprehensive study of the extent and impacts of \ngender inequality in relation to access and control over land, forests and water resources, \namong ethnic minorities in the Nam Ngum Basin. In November 2003 a fact-finding mission held \ndiscussions  with  MOF,  MAF,  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU),  provincial  governments, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and local communities, to seek concurrence on the TA\u2019s \ngoal and purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference  The TA Framework is attached in Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR is among the poorest countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion, with a \nnational poverty level of 36% (1998). Rural poverty is high, with 50\u201374% of the population below \nthe poverty line in the northern and mountain areas. Poverty is most pronounced among rural \npopulations, especially ethnic minorities. During the 2001 Participatory Poverty Assessment \n(PPA), ethnic minorities specifically identified factors leading to poverty: government policies \nrelated to shifting cultivation; land-use planning and land allocation; relocation programs; and \nlack of equitable access to land, forest, and water resources.6  \n \n3.  Women in the Lao PDR are extremely active in the economy and primarily responsible \n                                                 \n1  The TA was endorsed by the National Poverty Reduction Strategies/Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund meeting \nin July 2003. \n2  A workshop was organized at the Lao Resident Mission in May 2003, during which the Government requested TAs \nfor gender mainstreaming, including the above TA. \n3  The  World  Bank-assisted  Lao  PDR  Land-Titling  Project  has  been  in  operation  for  5  years,  and  is  being \nimplemented by the Department of Land Management on behalf of MOF. \n4  The Department of Land and Housing Management is the core national agency responsible for the design and \nimplementation of land management and administration programs. The mandate as defined by the Prime Minister's \nOffice Decree 104, 6 July 1993, is to carry out, under the direction of the Land Re-Management Committee, the \ndesign and supervision of national land registration and titling programs through the offices of provincial services. \nThe district land officer supported by the village headman (nai baan) provides the documentation, including tax \ncertification and proof of ownership, together with the required witnesses and documentation, to the provincial \noffice, which certifies and signs the documentation to the land.  \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 October 2003. \n6  ADB. 2001. Participatory Poverty Assessment: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila. \n ", "2 \nfor meeting their households\u2019 food requirements, health, and well-being. Gender gaps exist in \nseveral areas and are wider among northern ethnic minorities. Maternal mortality rates among \nethnic minorities are higher than national levels, at 540 per 100,000 live births. Only two minority \ncultures, the Pray in Xaygnabouri and the Sou\u2019 in Attapeu, are matrilineal; the rest either have \nbilateral  or  patrilineal  lines  of  inheritance.  Groups  such  as  the  Hmong  and  Khmu  do  not \nrecognize  women\u2019s  rights  to  own  property  except  under  specific  circumstances.  All  ethnic \nminority  cultures  assign  women  heavier  workloads  than  men  for  food  production,  income \ngeneration,  domestic  work,  and  maintenance  of  cultural  traditions.  While  customary  laws \nprohibit  them  from  inheriting  land  (depending  upon  the  culture  and  circumstances),  ethnic \nminority women living in traditional communities, do have access to land for food and livestock \nproduction, and collection of forest produce.  \n \n4.  National laws, policies, and programs are increasingly impacting upon the capacity of \nethnic minority women to meet their households\u2019 need for food security, minimum nonfood \nrequirements, and requirements of cultural traditions.7 Recent researches by LWU found that \nduring land registration, women lost out, by not having their names included in a variety of of \nland related documents. Researches from the Land-Titling Project and the Lao Swedish Upland \nAgriculture and Forestry Research Program emphasize the need for greater attention to gender \nissues in nonethnic Lao areas.  \n \n5.  Several laws and decrees determine land use planning and allocation.8 Land Decree 99 \n(1992) grants long-term land-use rights to Lao citizens. Such rights can be inherited, traded, \nleased, or sold. Land-use titles may be granted to the land users. While the Constitution and the \ndecree recognize women\u2019s rights to hold land, the implementation regulations9 often do not. \nClosely linked to land rights are rights to forest and water resources. Decrees10 have been \npassed to allocate land for forestry, plantation, and pastures to communities and individuals.11 \nAs a result of Article 20 of the Forestry Law, ethnic minority farmers cannot use forest fallow \nolder than 4 years, which means they can be allocated a maximum of four parcels of agricultural \nland.12 This causes soil degradation, declining rice yields, and increasing weed encroachment. \nWater rights and decision making related to water management derive from land-use rights. \nEven as the Lao PDR adopts community-managed irrigation systems, ethnic minority women \n                                                 \n7  Lao women are less literate than men (59.0% compared to 81.7%), and this gap is much larger for ethnic \nminorities. Similar gaps exist in schooling, enrolment, and completion levels. (ADB. 2001. Participatory Poverty \nAssessment: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila.)  \n8 The Constitution, promulgated in 1991, affirms the rights of individuals to use the land. The Fifth Party Congress \n(March 1991) identified the need to accelerate land registration and issue land title certificates. Management and \nadministration policies are reflected in the decrees promulgated by the Government, Property Law (1990), Land \nDecree (99 Prime Minister [PM]), Land Tax Decree (50 PM), Document Registration Decree (52 PM), and Forest \nManagement and Land-Use Decree (169 PM). A recent decree (186 PM) covers the allocation of forestlands with \nreference to allocation of lands to plantation forestry.  \n9 The only specific mention of gender with respect to land titles, is in the Constitution, which states that the names of \nhusband  and  wife  should  be  recorded  in  the  Land  Register  Book.  The  lack  of  gender  sensitivity  in  the \nimplementation regulations was noted in the report of the Lao Consulting Group on the Existing Land Tenure and \nForest Lands Study.  \n10 Decree 169 divided forestland into five categories: production, protection, conservation, village, and degraded. \nDecree 186 allows the state to allocate forestland for tree plantation and forest protection. In 1994 the National \nAssembly recognized Decree 169 as the forestry law, legalizing State control over forests. This law recognizes \nprivate rights over forests and ignores common property resources and communal rights to forest areas.   \n11 Decree 169 formalizes village rights to forest areas. Decision 0054/MAF defines and recognizes customary rights \nin forest and forestland. Article 4 states that these rights may be exercised freely within the limits of the law. \nHowever, some practices such as swiddens may be limited, which may reduce ethnic minorities\u2019 rice and livestock \nproduction. Registration of parcels of village forest in the name of the State will diminish ethnic minorities\u2019 access to \nresources.  \n12  Lao Consulting Group. 2002.

The Government has stressed the importance of ADB providing TA for mainstreaming \ngender in agriculture, which is a priority sector for poverty reduction. As a first step, trends and \npatterns of gender differentiation in access to, and control over, productive resources along \nethnic lines should be understood in-depth, and a strategy formulated to address these trends \nand  patterns.  The  counterpart  project,  Nam  Ngum  Basin  Development  Project,  is  being \nimplemented in Xieng Khouang Province, Xaysamboun Special Zone, and Vientiane Province \nand municipality. These provinces have a large number of small and big ethnic minorities with a \nvariety of cultures and traditional systems.14 The TA will concentrate on the extent and impacts \nof gender inequality among these communities, in relation to land and natural resources for \nlivelihood and food security. Lessons learned will be upscaled in other ADB-assisted projects in \nthe Lao PDR. \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n   \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.    The Project\u2019s goal is to identify ways to reduce poverty and improve gender equity \namong  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  Nam  Ngum  Basin.  The  purposes  are  to  (i)  increase \nawareness within government agencies and communities, of the extent and impacts on poverty, \nof prevalent gender inequality in access to land, forest, and water resources, among ethnic \nminority communities in the Nam Ngum Basin; (ii) to design solutions to address the issues of \ngender inequality and poverty among these communities, and (iii) to institutionalize gender \nresponsive programs within government agencies, that can help to address the issues of gender \ninequality and poverty.  \n \n8.    The scope of the Project includes the following: (i) in the first phase, an ethnographic \nstudy of gender issues, primarily in terms of ethnic minorities\u2019 rights and access to land and \nrelated issues of access to forest and water resources; and (ii) in the second phase, preparation \nand  implementation  of a  detailed strategy  to improve  gender  outcomes  in  the  counterpart \nproject. The ethnographic study to be done in the first phase will address the following: (i) \ngender patterns of resource allocation, management, and rights under customary laws of ethnic \nminority communities living in the Nam Ngum Basin; (ii) the impacts on women\u2019s rights, of state \nlaws and policies of relocation, stabilization of shifting cultivation, land-use planning and land \nallocation, forest demarcation, water resource allocation and management, (iii) analysis of the \nfactors  responsible  for  gender  gaps  in  delivery  of  government  services  and  programs, \nparticularly to ethnic minority women; and (iv) recommendations to close these gaps.  \n \n9.    The outputs will include (i) improved policy environment on gender equity in access to \nresources  (ii)  increased  awareness  among  government  agencies  and  ethnic  minority \ncommunities regarding the links between gender inequality and poverty, and increased support \nfor gender equity in access to and control over such resources, (iii) implementation of gender \nresponsive policies and measures designed to improve access of ethnic minority women and \ngirls to land, forest and water resources, and (iv) a strategy to institutionalize such policies and \nmeasures through the Nam Ngum Basin Development Sector Project, which is the counterpart \nproject for the TA. Success indicators include (i) completion of research and documentation; (ii) \nrural  women\u2019s  participation  in  community-based  organizations  for  natural  resource \n                                                 \n13 Since the membership of such groups has to do with access to irrigable lands, the absence of ethnic minorities \nshows their lack of access to such resources. \n14 Refer to ADB. 2001.

Methodology and Key Activities \n10.   The TA will cover districts with more than 50% ethnic minority population and high levels \nof poverty. The TA will be implemented in two phases. First, an ethnographic study will be \ncarried out with the findings of the 2001 PPA as the starting point.15 While it is a rich source of \ninformation on experiences of poverty of different cultural groups and their priorities, the PPA \ndoes not specifically address gender impacts of laws and policies related to land and forests \nwith regard to women\u2019s rights and livelihoods. The TA will address specific gender issues. It will \nreview laws, policies, and secondary materials, particularly writings of anthropologists such as \nGeorges Condominas, James Chamberlain,16 and others; and studies from Lao sources such \nas the Land-Titling Project, Lao Swedish Upland Agriculture and Forestry Research Project, \nNational  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy,  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU),  Gender \nResource Information and Development (GRID), ADB-assisted projects, among others.  \n \n11.   Following the review of materials, a Project Inception report will be prepared which will \nsummarize the present situation and indicate research issues and methodology. Participatory \nfield research will be carried out in at least three sites per province, in the subproject areas of \nthe counterpart project.17 Participatory research sites will be selected on the basis of (i) ethnic \nminority population, (ii) poverty level, and (iii) presence of relocated communities.18 A few \nadditional sites\u2014traditional minority settlements, as well as mixed settlements where several \ngroups  live  side  by  side\u2014will  be  selected  to  study  land-use  planning  and  land  allocation \nprocesses and provide the basis for case studies.  \n \n12.   Research methodology will consist of participant observation by teams staying in the \nsites; village meetings; focus group discussions with men and women, village leaders, and staff \nof land-use planning and land allocation agencies; key informant interviews; local workshops \nwith  village  participants  and  mass  organizations;  district  and  provincial  workshops;  and \ntriangulation of findings. Research teams will be drawn from a local research or academic \ninstitution, DAFO and LWU staff at the district level, and ethnic minority women and men from \nthe selected villages. Each research team will have at least two women. The teams will be \ntrained in gender-sensitive participatory research. Local and provincial workshops will be used \nto feed data back to the participants to confirm findings and recommendations. In the second \nphase, the activities will be (i) preparation of a detailed strategy to improve capacity of ethnic \nminority women, communities, and MAF and other government agencies; and training and \n                                                 \n15 The PPA describes the concerns of swidden cultivators regarding the government to stop shifting cultivation \nwithout providing viable options to ethnic minority groups. Gender issues covered in the PPA include the gender \ndivision of labor, kinship and inheritance, and human resource development. \n16 Halpem, Joel M. 1964.

Cost and Financing \n13.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $295,000 equivalent, of which $ 162,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $133,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $162,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $88,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB. The Government will bear the balance \nof  local  currency  costs,  amounting  to  $45,000  equivalent,  through  the  provision  of  office \naccommodation, administrative support, staff remuneration, and staff per diems. Cost estimates \nand financing arrangements are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   MAF will be the project executing agency. Implementing agencies will include DAFOs, \nPAFOs, and provincial units of LWU and GRID in the selected provinces. The Project steering \ncommittee  will consist of MAF,  Office of the National Project Manager, Nam Ngum Basin \nDevelopment Sector Project (ONPM), LWU, Water Resources Coordination Center, PAFOs and \nDAFOs,  and  representatives  of  LWU  and  GRID  in  the  selected  provinces.  The  steering \ncommittee will meet once every 6 months to discuss issues and outcomes of the Project and \ntake stock of progress. The Project will be implemented over 24 months, from June 2004 to May \n2006. Milestones will comprise (i) an inception meeting, (month 1); (ii) desk review of existing \ndata and preparation of inception report (month 2); (iii) site selection and participatory research \n(within 6 months); (iv) local, provincial, and national workshops (months 11-13) (v) preparation \nof interim report for submission to ADB (month 13-14); (vi) implementation of strategy for \ncapacity building of government agencies, communities (within months 14-24); (vi) draft final \nreport for submission to ADB (months16-17) and (vi) final report (month 22), ADB comments to \nbe incorporated and revised report to be submitted to ADB (month 24), .  \n   \n15.  An international consultant (Team Leader)\u2014a social anthropologist/lawyer with gender \nexpertise and experience in the sector\u2014will be recruited for 5 person-months, along with a \ndomestic consultant\u2014sociologist/gender specialist\u2014recruited for 12 person-months, to carry out \nthe study in collaboration with local Lao institutions. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nIV.
