As the privatization of the National Power Corporation (NPC) and the establishment of a\ncompetitive electricity market are in progress, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines\nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) in\norder to promote good governance in the restructured power sector and to sustain the progress\nachieved under the ADB-supported Power Sector Restructuring Program (PSRP).1 A Fact-\nFinding  Mission  that  was  conducted  from  2  February  to  3  March  2003  reached  an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing, and\nimplementation arrangements of the TA.2  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  ISSUES\n2. To address the problems facing the Philippine power sector, the Government decided to\nrestructure and privatize the electric power industry. The centerpiece of the restructuring of the\npower industry was the passage of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) in June\n2001 and promulgation of the implementing rules and regulations in February 2002. The EPIRA\nestablished a new legal and regulatory framework for the power sector and enabled unbundling\nthe power industry into generation, transmission, distribution, and supply sectors. The regulatory\nfunction  will  be  performed  by  the  newly  established,  independent  Energy  Regulatory\nCommission (ERC). The Department of Energy (DOE) will be responsible for the formulation of\npolicies for the planning and implementation of a comprehensive program for efficient electricity\nsupply. The EPIRA also created Government-owned corporations, i.e. the Power Sector Assets\nand Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) to manage the privatization of NPC, and the\nNational  Transmission  Corporation  (TRANSCO)  to  take  possession  of  NPC\u2019s  transmission\nassets to be operated by a private sector concessionaire.  The role of NPC will be reduced to\nthe operation of the Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG)  responsible  for  providing  power\ngeneration and its associated power delivery systems in areas that are not connected to the\nnational transmission system.\n3. With the creation of these new public sector entities and the expected entry of private\nsector players in the industry, promotion of good governance is essential to ensure transparent\nand reasonable electricity prices in a competitive market and full accountability to achieve\nreliable electricity supply in the country. While the new legal and regulatory framework has been\nestablished by EPIRA, there is still potential conflict between DOE\u2019s policy-making functions and\nERC\u2019s regulatory functions. It is important to draw a clear distinction between those regulations\nthat  are  appropriately  exercised  by  the  Government  and  those  that  should  be  left  to  an\nindependent  economic  regulator.  It  is  necessary  to  undertake  governance  assessment  to\nformulate relevant recommendations for streamlining the role of DOE in the restructured power\nsector and its relations with ERC. Other areas that have been identified as key to promote good\ngovernance in the power sector include: (i) institutional capacity of DOE to undertake its new\nmandates in the restructured power sector; and (ii) public-private partnership to accelerate and\nsustain rural electrification. All these issues will be addressed by the TA.\n4. To effectively deliver the new mandate under EPIRA, President Arroyo approved the\nreorganization of DOE in August 2002 and established a new unit within the DOE, i.e. the\nElectric  Power  Industry  Management  Bureau  (EPIMB).  The  EPIMB  will  have  the  following\nfunctions:  (i)  supervise  the  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  with  a  view  to  creating  a\n                                                \n1  ADB. 1998. Loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Power Sector Restructuring Program. Manila.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 19 March 2003.", "2\ncompetitive electricity market; (ii) formulate plans and programs that would ensure efficient and\nreliable electricity supply; and (iii) formulate plans and strategies on rural electrification. For the\ntask (i) the ongoing ADB TA for transition to a competitive electricity market3 is providing needed\nexpertise to DOE for the establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market, while this TA will\nspecifically assist DOE in undertaking the tasks (ii) and (iii) through capacity building of EPIMB.\n5. As part of its policy-making functions, the EPIMB will prepare the power development\nplan (PDP) and approve the transmission development plan (TDP) which will be prepared by\nTRANSCO. The PDP will provide an annual plan for managing electricity demand through\nenergy-efficient programs and for the upgrading, expansion, rehabilitation, and maintenance of\npower generation and transmission facilities. In accordance with the guidelines of the PDP,\nTRANSCO will propose the TDP for managing the transmission system efficiently through\neffective planning for expansion, upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance and this will be\nimplemented after its approval by EPIMB.\n6. The EPIMB will also prepare the missionary electrification development plan (MEDP) to\nspecify the respective roles of public and private sectors in rural electrification and provide a\ntime-bound  action  plan  including  capital  investment,  operations,  and  generating  capacity\nadditions. The Government has an accelerated rural electrification program that targets all\nbarangays by 2006. By the end of 2002, electrification at the barangay level was around 85%,\nleaving about 5,500 barangays unelectrified, which are mostly located in isolated or remote\nareas. Innovative public-private partnerships are required to expand electrification in these\ndifficult areas. Operation in these areas will be opened to the private sector, which will provide\nthe service with government subsidies through a competitive bidding process.\n7. The power sector restructuring process in the Philippines has now entered into a critical\nphase. As the lead financing agency in the power sector in the Philippines, ADB will continue to\nreview  and  monitor  the  privatization  process  and  conduct  regular  policy  dialog  with  the\nGovernment. After the power sector\u2019s restructuring, the expansion of generation capacity and\ntransmission networks will be carried out primarily by the private sector.  ADB\u2019s future role will\nbe mainly to assist the Government in pursuing further reforms to promote good governance,\nstrengthen the regulatory framework of the power sector, ensure healthy market competition\nand support rural electrification. The TA has been formulated in consultation with other donors\nto avoid duplication. The World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) are providing TA to DOE to\nstrengthen its capacity in other critical areas including monitoring system for the implementation\nof EPIRA, promotion of new and renewable energy, and harmonization of market rules and grid\ncode.\n8. Moreover, in view of the importance of the ERC in ensuring good governance in the\npower sector, ADB has coordinated with USAID to provide institutional support to ERC to\nstrengthen its role in the restructured power sector. The consultants engaged by ADB and\nUSAID,  including  former  regulators  from  developed  countries,  have  been  instrumental  in\nassisting ERC in undertaking its functions. In particular, ADB\u2019s on-going TA (footnote 3) helped\nERC  to  develop  a  performance-based  regulation  framework  for  power  transmission  and\ndistribution, which is critical for the privatization of transmission assets. Further, ADB has\nrecently secured a grant of $300,000  from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility\n                                                \n3  ADB. 2002.

Manila.", "3\n(PPIAF)4  to  assist  ERC  in  dealing  with  regulatory  issues  affecting  distribution  utilities  and\nelectric cooperatives. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Purpose and Output\n9. The long-term goal of ADB\u2019s assistance is to ensure the quality, reliability, security, and\naffordability of electricity supply in the Philippines. The TA supports this goal by (i) strengthening\nDOE in order to fulfill its new mandate in the restructured power sector, and (ii) promoting good\ngovernance to sustain the achievements of the power sector restructuring program. Based on\nthe recommended policies and strategies, the TA will identify areas that need further support.\n10. The governance assessment to be conducted by the TA will help clarify the respective\nroles of DOE and ERC, and promote good governance in the restructured power sector by : (i)\nstrengthening  of  DOE\u2019s  planning  capacities  through  capacity  building  of  EPIMB;  and  (ii)\nformulation of the five-year MEDP to promote public and private partnerships for the expansion\nof rural electrification in nonviable areas. The TA will also identify areas in which the power\nsector may need further strengthening.\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities\n11. The TA will adopt a participatory approach in the development of power sector by\nconsulting target groups, communities, relevant government agencies, stakeholders, and non-\ngovernmental organizations active in the area covered by the TA. National inventories will be\ntaken to create a database for the preparation of the PDP, TDP, and MEDP. Consultations, and\nfield visits will also be undertaken to ensure successful implementation of the mandates of the\nEPIRA. Partnerships will be established with counterpart jurisdictions in other countries with\nrelevant experience to help EPIMB staff absorb lessons learned on power sector restructuring\nand development of competitive markets.\n12. The capacity building of EPIMB include the following key activities:\n(i)  undertaking a necessary governance assessment and  formulating necessary\nrecommendations to remove potential conflicts between  DOE\u2019s policy-making\nfunctions and ERC\u2019s regulatory functions;\n(ii)  undertaking  institutional  analysis  and  formulation  of  recommendations  to\nstrengthen EPIMB to undertake its new mandates in the restructured power\nsector;\n(iii)  development of implementation plans in generation and transmission that are\nconsistent with power sector restructuring strategy;\n(iv)  development of national inventories relating to existing generation, transmission\nand  distribution  capacities,  through  workshops,  field  visits  and  stakeholders\u2019\nconsultations;\n(v)  provision of software for the development of a national database including a\nsystem for on-line submission of information required for review and preparation\nof the PDP, TDP and MEDP;  and provision of relevant training to EPIMB staff;\n                                                \n4 The PPIAF is a multilateral TA facility aimed at helping developing countries improve their infrastructure through\nprivate sector involvement. The PPIAF is owned and directed by participating aid agencies including ADB.", "4\n(vi)  establishment of partnerships with counterpart agencies in other countries that\nhave undertaken electricity restructuring in order to learn from their experience;\n(vii)  development  of  a  monitoring  and  management  system  of  electrification  and\nrelated  livelihood  development  projects,  and  provision  of  relevant  training  to\nEPIMB staff; and\n(viii)  provision  of  necessary  computers,  office  equipment  and  other  multimedia\ndevices that are necessary for the establishment of databases; and provision of\nrelevant training to EPIMB staff for the use of this equipment.\n13. The development and formulation of the MEDP will include the following key activities:\n(i)  formulation of recommendations on public-private partnership to accelerate and\nsustain rural electrification in nonviable areas;\n(ii)  review  of  the  definition  of  rural  electrification,  and  inclusion  of  relevant\nrecommendations  in the MEDP;\n(iii)  listing  of  unelectrified  barangays  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  MEDP,    and\ndevelopment of energy database available in the barangays that can be tapped;\n(iv)  identification  of  appropriate  parameters,  e.g.,  technical,  financial,  and\nsocioeconomic impact of the project,  that should be taken into consideration;\n(v)  review of ongoing missionary electrification projects for existing SPUG areas and\nsubsidy scheme appropriate for the MEDP;\n(vi)  formulation of financial/technical evaluation models for prioritization and project\ncost evaluation methodology for MEDP projects; and\n(vii)  development of a sample business case for  SPUG\u2019s existing areas that are\nsuitable for privatization as well as indicative timetable.\n14. In consultation with relevant government agencies and other stakeholders in the power\nsector, the TA consultants will be required to identify areas, if any, where further strengthening\nof power sector is necessary.  In particular, the following activities will be undertaken:\n(i)  identification of gaps, if any, in institutional capacity and financial resources to\nfully implement the PDP, TDP, and MEDP;\n(ii)  recommendation  of  policy  initiatives  to  further  promote  public-private  sector\npartnerships in the implementation of  the PDP, TDP, and MEDP; and\n(iii)  identification of areas in the power sector that require further strengthening, and\npreparation of an assistance plan for the power sector.\nC.  Cost and Financing\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1.15 million equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange cost of $730,000 and local currency costs of $420,000 equivalent. The TA will be\nfinanced, on a grant basis, by ADB\u2019s TA funding program in the amount of $800,000 equivalent,\nwhich will include the entire foreign currency cost and $70,000 equivalent in local currency\ncosts. The Government will contribute the remaining $350,000 equivalent in kind, including\noffice  accommodation  in  Manila,  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  secretarial  support,  and\nworkshops. The Government assured the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and\nfunds by the TA's expected commencement date. Details of the cost estimates and financing\nplan are in Appendix 2.", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. DOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will work in close collaboration with\nERC and other relevant government agencies. DOE will assign a project coordinator prior  to\ncontract negotiations, and  counterpart staff to work with the consultants.\n17. The TA will be carried out over 12 months starting in September 2003 for completion by\nSeptember 2004. Consultants' inputs will amount to about  30  person-months  (16  person-\nmonths  international  and  14  person-months  domestic).  The  international  consultants  will\ncomprise  (i)  a  team  leader  with  extensive  experience  in  power  sector  restructuring  and\nprivatization (6 person-months); (ii) a rural electrification specialist with experience in new and\nrenewable energy technologies (3 person-months); (iii) a legal/regulatory specialist  (3 person-\nmonths); and (iv) an information technology specialist with experience in developing energy\ndatabases (4 person-months).  The domestic consultants will include (i) a rural electrification\nand socioeconomic development expert (6 person-months); (ii) an information technology expert\non databases (6 person-months); and (iii) communication experts (2 person-months).  The\nconsultants will be engaged by ADB through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection\nmethod in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal format\nwill be used. Equipment for use by the consultants will be procured in accordance with ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement. The  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in\nAppendix 3.\n18. The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  project\nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports\nwill be submitted: an inception report within 2 weeks from TA commencement, an interim report\nof TA progress within 6 months, and a draft final report towards the end of the TA.  After\nreceiving the inception report, ADB will undertake an inception mission to discuss and agree\nwith the Executing Agency and the consultants on the various milestones of TA implementation.\nA TA review mission will be fielded after the receipt of the interim report to monitor the progress\nof TA implementation and make necessary adjustments. A tripartite meeting will be held at the\nend of TA implementation to discuss the consultants\u2019 draft final report. The final report will be\nprepared by the consultants within 15 days after the tripartite meeting has taken place among\nDOE, the consultants, and ADB to discuss the draft final report.\n19. All computer models, databases, and training materials developed by the consultants\nincluding office equipment purchased during the TA will be transferred to DOE upon completion\nof the TA, and thereafter will remain the property of the Government.\nIV.
