To improve community and industrial forestry and increase its impact on rural livelihoods \nand poverty reduction, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) plans to undertake a participatory \nassessment of community and industrial forestry policies and practices in the Mekong region. In \nSeptember 2002 a concept paper for the technical assistance (TA) was prepared, and endorsed \nfor funding by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom. The Fact-Finding Mission fielded on 3\u201315 November 2002 visited Cambodia, \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  Viet  Nam,  and  regional  organizations1  in \nThailand to seek stakeholder input on the design and implementation of the TA. Its objectives, \nscope, approach, cost estimates and financing plan, and terms of reference for consulting \nservices are based on the findings of the Mission, and the understandings reached with those \nconsulted. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the Mekong region (including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet \nNam) about a third of the population (80 million out of 200 million) are classified as poor. Most of \nthe poor live in rural areas, often in or near forests, and some of the poorest are ethnic \nminorities in remote upland areas. Forests function as safety nets and often supply a significant \nportion of rural peoples\u2019 incomes. For example, many rural communities in the Lao PDR derive \nvirtually all their food, except for rice, from the forests, and use over 700 species to generate \nnon-wood forest products, which, on average, provide 55% of family cash income of villages \nnear forests.3 Forest loss and degradation thus destroy livelihoods of the rural poor and make \nthem vulnerable. The 1999 floods in central Viet Nam were partly due to deforestation and \ndegradation of the catchment and resulted in the loss of over 700 lives and property damage of \nover $250 million.4  \n \n3.  Over the past 20 years the Mekong region population has increased from around 143 \nmillion in 1980 to 202 million in 2000, or by about 2% annually on average. In the same period \nthe total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region\u2019s countries has grown from around $63 \nbillion to about $170 billion, representing an average annual growth rate of just over 5%. \nDeforestation, however, has been increasing from an average of around 0.7% annually in the \nearly 1980s to almost 2% in the late 1990s, with over 1.1 million hectares lost per year. The \nforest  area  data,  however,  does  not  show  the  degradation  of  the  residual  forest  due  to \nunsustainable logging and encroachment. \n \n4.  If population growth continues at the present rate in the coming decade, all countries \nexcept Thailand will have to raise per capita GDP to around $600 if they are to reduce poverty \nby 50% by 2015. GDP will have to grow by about 5.5% in Viet Nam and Lao PDR, and over 8% \nin Cambodia and Myanmar. Even if these growth rates are achieved, the total number of poor \npeople is likely to exceed 40 million out of a projected population of around 280 million. The \nimplications of these growth and development patterns for upland Mekong communities and \ntheir livelihood security and sustainability are profound.5 As the pressure to use forest products \nand  land  for  alternative  uses  increases,  upland  natural  resources,  including  forests,  will \n                                                 \n1  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The World Conservation Union (IUCN), and Regional \nCommunity Forestry Training Center, Bangkok, Thailand. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in October 2002. \n3  ADB 2002.

", "2 \ncontribute little to sustainable growth. Environmental degradation will, therefore, increase, and \nupland food and livelihood security will be at risk.  \n \n5.  If  upland  development  and  environmental  protection  challenges  are  not  faced  and \nmanaged,  the  planned  poverty  reduction  gains  and  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  objective  will \nprobably  not  be  secured  or  sustained.  Already  vulnerable  upland  forest-dependent \ncommunities, particularly ethnic minorities and women, will be pushed deeper into persistent \npoverty. If poverty reduction strategies and ADB investments are to have full impact, particularly \nin the forest and natural resources sectors, the Mekong upland forests must be used to reduce \npoverty. Emphasis must be on creating jobs that disadvantaged upland communities, including \nethnic minorities and women, can easily adapt to, and on instituting sound forest resource \nmanagement policies and practices. \n \n6.  Community forestry approaches, which require participation of communities and key \nstakeholders in all aspects of forest planning and management, are increasing rapidly in the \nregion. Institutionalizing such approaches, however, has been difficult as issues related to \ntenure and access, sharing of costs and benefits of jointly managed resources, and agreement \non the roles and responsibilities of government agencies and communities continue to be \nproblematic. Industrial forestry, which involves large-scale forest resource management and \nprocessing, has good potential to create jobs and income, but its operations have not been \nconducted in a sustainable manner. Policy, project, and technological interventions are needed \nto improve industrial forestry.  \n \n7.  Community and industrial forestry has been developed in accessible areas, primarily to \nmeet the need for revenue and wood supply. Community forestry should be extended to upland \nareas  where  most  socioeconomically  disadvantaged  communities  reside.  Some  forms  of \ncommunity forestry need to focus on preventing poverty or on performing a safety net function, \nincluding through the use and sale of non-wood forest products for subsistence or through \npreservation  of  essential  local  environmental  services.  Other  forms  need  to  focus  on \ncommercial timber and harvesting of non-wood forest products, and on functioning not only as a \nsafety net but on reducing poverty, as well. \n \n8.  Some modes of forest-based poverty reduction do not fall under community or industrial \nforestry. Some modes such as improved marketing of non-wood forest products and payment \nfor environmental services such as watershed protection, carbon sequestration, and ecotourism \nmay  ultimately  reduce  poverty  in  remote  uplands  more  effectively  than  current  modes  of \ncommunity  or  industrial  forestry.  While  it  is  gaining  a  foothold  in  some  remote  upland \ncommunities in the Lao PDR and Cambodia, community forestry has yet to be fully recognized \nas a viable forest management and poverty reduction strategy in Viet Nam. The region\u2019s forest \nindustry  and  investment  structure  is  changing  in  response  to  trade  liberalization  and \nglobalization, and their possible impact on the poverty reduction potential of community and \nindustrial forestry in the region should be assessed. Enabling community and industrial forestry \npolicy frameworks and incentive structures need to be in place to reduce poverty and develop \nthe uplands in a sustainable manner, particularly to benefit disadvantaged ethnic minorities and \nwomen. \n \n9.  A  participatory  multi-stakeholder  evaluation  of  community  and  industrial  forestry \ninitiatives and investment to date is needed to enhance their poverty reduction impact. Equally \nimportant is to increase key Mekong region policymakers\u2019 involvement in determining, and \ncommitting to, country-specific community and industrial forestry policy reform agenda and ", "    3 \naction plans to promote sustainable forest resource management and enhance its poverty \nreduction function and impact on upland communities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to review and assess poverty reduction performance and \npotential of community (subsistence and commercial) and industrial forestry in the Mekong \nregion. The TA will focus on Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, especially in provinces that \nhave a high incidence of poverty and where forest-based activity can improve livelihoods and \nincrease  rural  incomes,  and  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  forest-dependent  communities, \nparticularly poor ethnic minorities and women, to the changing economic and development \nenvironment.  The  TA  will  assess  the  likely  impacts  of  the  changing  forest  industry  and \ninvestment  structure,  and  regional  forest  product  trade  patterns  on  the  profitability  and \nsustainability of community and industrial forestry. \n \n11.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s policy of instituting participatory sustainable forest management, \nthe  TA  will  (i)  identify  forestry  development  strategies  to  increase  the  food  and  livelihood \nsecurity  of  smallholder  farm  families  living  in  and  near  remote  and  inaccessible  forests;6 \n(ii) assess the potential of community forestry to reduce poverty in upland communities of \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam; (iii) compare the potential of industrial forestry to reduce \npoverty in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, particularly through formal employment and \nindirect or multiplier effects; (iv) review and assess the effects of forest product trade on rural \nlivelihoods,  and  the  degree  of  integration  of  the  forest  sector  into  comprehensive  poverty \nreduction  and  growth  strategy  papers  (CPRGSPs)  and  poverty  reduction  partnership \nagreements (PPAs); (v) identify enabling policy frameworks and good practices to maximize the \npoverty reduction impact of community and industrial forestry in these countries, particularly for \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged groups such as ethnic minorities and women; and (vi) involve \nkey policymakers in determining community and industrial forestry policy reform agenda and \naction plans. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will focus on the following activities in poor upland communities in selected \nareas in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam: \n \n(i)  Poverty reduction through community forestry. This will involve (a) a global \nreview of various approaches to poverty reduction through community forestry; \n(b) analysis of regional, national, and local secondary data; and (c) interviews \nwith  participants  in  community  forestry  projects  and  poor  forest-dependent \ncommunities, particularly ethnic minorities and local women\u2019s groups; forestry \nextension agents; members of development and environment nongovernment \norganizations;  and  local  policymakers.  Multi-stakeholder  workshops  and  field \nresearch will be undertaken at three community forestry sites in each country. A \nsynthesis  report  and  policy  brief  will  be  prepared  in  collaboration  with \nparticipating  communities,  line  agencies,  and  key  policymakers  and  project \nimplementers.  The  proposed  policy  frameworks,  and  reform  action  plans, \nincluding investment strategies, will be presented and validated at a national \nmulti-stakeholder workshop in each country.  \n                                                 \n6  Upland households with ownership of or access to less than 3 hectares of forest area. ", "4 \n \n(ii)  Poverty reduction through industrial forestry. This will involve (a) a global \nreview of various approaches to poverty reduction through industrial forestry; \n(b) analysis of regional, national, and local secondary data; and (c) interviews \nwith forest industry employees, and management-level representatives of forest \nconcessions, transport companies, and processing enterprises (e.g. sawmills, \nfurniture  factories,  plywood  industries,  pulp  and  paper  mills),  among  others. \nMulti-stakeholder workshops and field research will be undertaken at three forest \nindustrial enterprises in each country. A synthesis report and policy brief will be \nprepared  in  cooperation  with  local  communities,  including  socioeconomically \ndisadvantaged groups, enterprise owners and managers, and concerned line \nagencies and policymakers. The proposed policy frameworks, and reform action \nplans, including investment strategies to maximize the poverty reduction impact \nof industrial forestry, will be presented and validated at a national workshop in \neach country. \n \n(iii)  Integration of the forest sector into CPRGSPs and PPAs. This will involve \n(a) a review and analysis of the three country CPRGSPs and PPAs with regard \nto the poverty reduction potential of forestry investments and operations; and \n(b) interviews with government officials and development partners on the role of \ncommunity and industrial forestry in implementing CPRGSPs and PPAs. The \nproposed action plan to strengthen the forest sector\u2019s linkages, and the role of \nADB and other development partners in implementing CPRGSPs, PPAs, and \nforest sector policy and investment priorities will be presented and validated at a \nnational multi-stakeholder workshop in each country. \n \n(iv)  Poverty reduction impact of changes in forest industry and investment \nstructures  and  the  forest  product  trade  in  the  Mekong  region.  This  will \ninvolve  assessing  the  effect  of  the  forest  product  trade  on  rural  livelihoods \nthrough (a) an analysis of regional, national, and local secondary data; and \n(b) interviews with people in the marketing chain, from producer to consumer, \nmanagement  agencies,  and  institutions  and  individuals  knowledgeable  about \nlegal and illegal trade. The impact of the changing composition and structure of \nthe  forest  industry  and  investments  on  the  poverty  reduction  potential  of \ncommunity and industrial forestry will also be assessed. A regional consultative \nworkshop will be held to discuss and agree upon an enabling regional community \nand industrial forestry policy framework and reform action plan that will maximize \nsynergies  between  community  and  industrial  forestry.  Measures  will  include \nminimizing transboundary policy or practice conflicts, and improving forest sector \ninvestment environment and governance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at about $1 million equivalent, with an amount not \nexceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund. ADB will administer the grant in accordance with ADB\u2019s regulations on \ncofinancing. The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Food and Agriculture \nOrganization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  Regional  Office  for  Asia,  and  participating \ncommunities will contribute $200,000 equivalent in kind. The cost estimates include consulting \nservices;  international  and  local  travel;  community,  country,  and  regional  consultations; ", "    5 \nmaterials and equipment; and preparation and dissemination of information and knowledge-\nsharing materials. Details of the cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 15 months. Phase 1 will be from \nAugust 2003 to October 2003; phase 2, November 2003 to May 2004; and phase 3, June to \nOctober 2004. The TA will be executed by ADB.7 TA implementation will involve a team of \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants  with  experience  and  expertise  in  natural  resource \nsociology and/or community forestry and management; gender and social development; ethnic \nminorities; forest economics, with an emphasis on commercial community forestry, job creation, \nand poverty reduction; industrial forestry finance, with an emphasis on wood and non-wood \nforest product trade and sector investments in the Mekong region; and participatory forest \nresource planning and management. A dedicated web page will be established to disseminate \nTA implementation findings and outputs. \n \n15.  The TA will adopt a participatory approach to implementation. CIFOR, FAO, and The \nWorld Conservation Union (IUCN) in Bangkok, Thailand, will provide staff input and peer review \nexpertise. These organizations have extensive global and regional experience and expertise in \ncommunity  and  industrial  forestry.  An  estimated  input  of  about  12  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  30  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  needed. \nIndividual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of international \nand domestic consultants. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The \noutline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. On completion of the TA, \nprocured equipment such as computers and printers will be transferred to partner line agencies \nin the participating countries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  for  Poverty \nReduction in Upland Communities in the Mekong Region through Improved Community and \nIndustrial Forestry to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n7  Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division (MKAE) of the Mekong Department.
