INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  To support Cambodia\u2019s efforts to implement a pro-poor trade strategy and to address in a \ntimely manner the potential downside risks caused by phasing out of quota restrictions, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) proposes a technical assistance (TA) to examine the direct and indirect \nimpact of this change on the Cambodian garment industry and its workers. In December 2002, a \ncross-regional  TA  concept  paper,  originally  developed  for  Bangladesh  and  Cambodia,  was \nendorsed for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. A TA Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited Cambodia from 3-12 February 2003 and reached an understanding with the Government on \nthe objectives, scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nTA. The Cambodia component later became a stand-alone TA, and its concept paper was cleared \nby ADB Management on 15 May 2003.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Cambodia has a narrow economic base. The majority of the population live in rural areas, \nrelying on rice cultivation for their livelihood. Cambodia is classified in the United Nations (UN) \nsystem  as  one  of  the  least  developed  countries,  with  a  per  capita  gross  domestic  product \nestimated at only $257 dollars in 2000. This is among the lowest in the region. The incidence of \nrural poverty, at 40%, is high. Another 40% of the rural population live near the poverty line and are \nvulnerable to slipping into poverty at any time. Garment exports and revenues from tourism \naccount for most of Cambodia's non-official foreign exchange revenue.  \n \n3.  The garment industry has been the engine of growth for Cambodia since the mid-1990s. \nGarment exports increased from $20 million in 1995 to more than $1 billion in 2001 and garments \nnow account for almost 95% of exports. The textile and garment industry is highly labor intensive. \nCurrently, there are around 200 garment factories in Cambodia, concentrating around Phnom \nPenh and neighboring provinces and employing an estimated 200,000 workers. However, reliance \non a few core sectors makes the Cambodian economy extremely vulnerable to changes in the \ninternational trading environment and markets. \n \n4.  In Cambodia, female labor participation, at 74% among women over the age of 15, is \namong the highest in the region, and this has played a critical role in economic development. \nAccording to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics, about 64% of the workers in \nthe manufacturing sector are employed by the garment industry, and 85-90% of the workers in the \ngarment industry are women. The majority of garment workers are single women between the ages \nof 18 and 24 who have migrated to Phnom Penh from rural villages. Female garment workers \nrepresent 20% of the total female population between the ages of 18 and 24. Their level of \neducation is generally low. The average total monthly income of these women is about $50-80. \nThis income supports at least 100,000 poor rural households, which rely on remittances by women \nfemale garment workers. It is estimated that around 50% of their monthly salary is sent back to the \nvillages.  \n \n5.  Despite  their  contribution  to  wealth  creation  in  the  garment  industry,  female  garment \nworkers experience social prejudice, as their moving to the cities and working in the factories \nchallenges the traditional social norm of women staying at home. Some of them have to pay a \nlarge fee in order to gain employment in the garment factories. Their vulnerability dramatically \nincreases if they lose their jobs in the factories.  \n                                                 \n1   The project first appeared in  ADB Business Opportunities as a regional TA on  7 February 2003. This was \nsubsequently updated with further processing of the TA, including the decision to process the Cambodia component \nas a stand-alone TA. ", "2   \n6.  Textile  and  clothing  import  quotas  have  been  a  controversial  topic  in  the  General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor organization, the World Trade Organization \n(WTO).  Quotas  were  introduced  by  developed  countries  in  the  1960s  to  protect  domestic \nproducers as low-income countries started to dominate trade in textiles and clothing. This raised \nprices in developed countries above their competitive level. Developing countries exerted strong \npressure for removal of quotas during the Uruguay Round negotiations. As a result, the WTO \nmembers agreed to phase out quotas on textiles and clothing during a transitional period of 10 \nyears from 1995. Quota allocations guaranteed market access of some developing countries. \nHowever, overtime, they constrained competition. The benefits gained for individual countries from \nremoval of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) will be uneven, and less efficient producers, will be \ndisadvantaged. This concern is becoming increasingly acute with the imminence of the final date \nfor phasing out of the quota restrictions at the end of 2004. \n \n7.  In the case of Cambodia, the growth of the garment industry is consistent with its current \nstage of economic development. Cambodian exporters have so far enjoyed preferential access for \napparel products to the EU market under both the Generalized System of Preferences and \nEverything but the Arm Scheme. In the US market, about half of Cambodia\u2019s exports are not \nsubject to quota allocation, while 12 categories of textile products, accounting for another half of its \nexports, are subject to quota restrictions. The preferential access partly explains why there has \nbeen a dramatic increase of garment export in the last 5 years.  \n \n8.  The implications of lifting quota restrictions by the end of 2004 for Cambodia are uncertain \nbut could be far reaching and the adjustment costs high. A better understanding is therefore \nrequired of the likely impact caused by this change on the garment industry and its workers. It is \nimportant to address the potential social implication of the adjustment cost as well as related labor \nmarket issues arising from phasing out of quota restrictions. Workers, affected by removal of quota \nrestrictions, may require assistance. \n \n9.  The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study for Cambodia, which was prepared in 2002 as part \nof  the  Integrated  Framework  for  Trade-Related  Assistance  to  Least  Developed  Countries2, \nincluded a sector study on the garment industry. This raised the issue of determining the capacity \nof Cambodian producers to compete post-2005. Given the importance of the garment sector, it is \nessential  that  the  Government  focus  on  creating  the  enabling  environment  to  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of the garment industry and make efforts to encourage it to upgrade as well as to \ndiversify.3 It is also important that the government pay attention at an early stage to the social \npolicy and redistribution issues arising from trade liberalization. This will create social consensus \non the importance of the private sector and free trade for future economic development. It is critical \nthat basic education, skills development, and other training programs are in place to address the \nspecific needs of displaced workers to avoid further worsening of the poverty situation.  It is only \nwhen both ends are taken into consideration that the benefits of trade liberalization can be \nrealized. The TA, with its focus on garment industry and its workers, will complement a newly \n                                                 \n2   This is supported by WTO, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the UN Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, the International Trade Center (ITC), and the UN Development Programme (UNDP). \n3   The World Bank is currently preparing a private sector strategy, which is looking into supply chain linkages, including \nthe garment sector. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is proposing a trade capacity-\nbuilding regional workshop that will examine, among others, the value chain in late 2003. ITC has assisted the \nGovernment to develop a pro-poor trade strategy under the Integrated Framework. UNDP is working with the Ministry \nof Commerce to assess the social impact of Export Processing Zone. ADB is in preparation of a private sector \nassessment.  The  International  Labor  Organization  has  implemented  the  Garment  Sector  Working  Conditions \nImprovement Project, establishing a database of garment factories and introduced the application of labor standards \nto those factories.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The overall objective of the TA is to help Cambodia to achieve the goal of sustainable \npoverty reduction and gender development through addressing in a timely manner the potential \ndownside risks caused by phasing out of the quota restrictions on textiles and clothing at the end of \n2004. The emergence of a modern, labor-intensive industry sector, in particular the garment \nsubsector, has played an important role in reducing poverty and promoting growth in Cambodia. To \nensure continuation of this trend, the Government is determined to create more jobs through \npromoting  both  domestic  and  foreign  investment  in  the  areas  of  agricultural  production  and \nprocessing, tourism, and other light industries. The Government has expressed strong interest in \nunderstanding, examining, and addressing the social, poverty, and gender implications of initiatives \nin trade liberalization and integration. It is the view of the Government that only when these issues \nare attended to in a timely fashion can Cambodia benefit from trade integration with other Asian \neconomies and the rest of world.  \n \n11.  The TA will produce three major outputs: (i) a comprehensive situation analysis of the \ngarment industry and workers in the sector, identifying likely scenarios and recommendations for \noptions (Component 1); (ii) following the recommendations of Component 1, introduction of small \npilot schemes to (a) build formal and informal safety nets and effectively establish links with \nalternative employment opportunities for the workers, and (b) develop and test effective short-term \nsocial protection measures for those retrenched (Components 2 and 3); and (iii) strengthened \ncapacity of concerned government, private sector, and civil society organizations to address the \ndownside risks caused by MFA phaseout (Components 4 and 5).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will have five components, which will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will \ninclude primarily Component 1. An interministerial committee, chaired by the Ministry of Commerce \n(MOC), will discuss the core findings and provide guidance to the TA team. The implementation of \nComponents  2  and  3  during  Phase  2  will  proceed  after  the  discussion  has  been  held  and \nconsensus has been reached based on the findings of Component 1. During Phase 2, the TA team \nwill work closely with the ministries and service providers to introduce a series of pilot training and \nsocial protection programs. Components 4 and 5 will continue throughout the TA implementation \nperiod. The TA implementation will be participatory, involving key line ministries, garment sector \nrepresentatives, the private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the unions active in the \ngarment sector, and garment workers. International organizations that are active in the garment \nsector, in particular the International Labour Organization, will be consulted during implementation \nof the TA. \n \n13.  Component 1: Situation Analysis and Strategy Development. This component will (i) \nassess the current situation of the garment industry and its job creation, poverty reduction, and \nwomen empowerment effects to date; (ii) elicit the current profiles, needs, and aspirations of the \n                                                 \n4\n   ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "4   \ngarment workers and their labor conditions; (iii) discern the profiles and roles of NGOs, trade \nunions, chambers of commerce, and other organizations in supporting garment workers; (iv) devise \npotential scenarios for the garment industry, including the long-run growth impact of Cambodia\u2019s \nemployment, output, and other benchmarks due to the changes brought about by the elimination of \nquota restrictions; their potential impacts on poverty reduction and women empowerment efforts; \nand  the  potential  investment  shift  due  to  changes  in  marketplace  conditions;  (v)  develop \ncompetitive, pro-poor, and empowering options and interventions for the garment industry and its \nworkers, and for improved industrial relations; and (vi) develop a database of sample workers to \ntrack their employment status throughout the TA period. The study will include extensive review of \nexisting literature, sample surveys, focus group discussions with key stakeholder participation, and \nother quantitative and qualitative methods and tools. \n  \n14.  Component 2: Employment and Labor Market Pilots. The component will help garment \n(and, if relevant, footwear) workers to effectively cope with changing job market requirements and \nidentify meaningful alternative livelihoods. Guided by the findings of Component 1, the TA will \nidentify one or two NGOs to test the pilots. Most female workers have little education and lack \nfunctional  literacy.  The  component  will  provide,  on  a  pilot  basis,  either  at  factories  or  near \nresidences, functional literacy and basic life skills training. Depending on the needs and priorities \nidentified in Component 1, Component 2 may also include various technical training and retraining \ncourses (possibly cost shared by the employers), skills accreditation and job information systems, \nand entrepreneurship training for self-employment (e.g., seamstress, catering business, beauty \nsalon). Sustainable training programs relevant to the kinds of jobs in highest demand, aiming at \neventually shortening the temporary jobless period and minimizing adverse impacts on displaced \nworkers, should be given due consideration. Training programs to assist women who wish to return \nto rural areas to acquire some additional skills for rural entrepreneurship will be of particular \nimportance, given the social stigma these women will face as ex-garment workers. \n \n15.  Component 3: Social Protection Pilot. Effective social protection measures (such as \ntemporary shelter, food and clothing subsidy, basic health and counseling services, or a micro-\ninsurance  scheme)  for  the  unemployed  period  will  be  tested  for  potential  scaling  up.  Such \nassistance should be time bound to encourage the affected to look for alternative jobs. This could \nbe implemented by the identified NGO partners who are already working with vulnerable groups. \nDetailed designs of Component 3 will be developed in Component 1. \n \n16.  Component 4: Institutional Capacity Building. Opportunities for mutual learning will be \nprovided to relevant government staff, garment sector representatives, or private sector and NGO \nservice providers. This could also include discussions on how trade and industry policy could be \neffectively incorporated into the country\u2019s development plan and garment industry management. \nCapacity building will  largely occur on a national level through formal and on-the-job training. \nDissemination of the TA findings and outcomes will be carried out through various media. At the \nregional level, two regional exchanges or workshops will be carried out between Cambodia and \ntwo or three countries facing similar situations, so that lessons learned from the TA and other \ncountries\u2019 post-MFA strategies may be shared.  \n \n17.  Component 5: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Exploring the \nPotential  for  Scaling  Up.  A  central  TA  implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nmonitoring and evaluation, which will be carried out for all components with the consultants\u2019 \nassistance.  ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA in Cambodia is  $590,000 equivalent, of which $225,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $365,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$500,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $275,000 equivalent of the \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  TA  will  be  funded  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto $90,000, through the provision of staff salaries, administrative costs, and other related costs. A \ndetailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MOC. An interministerial committee comprising \nMOC; the ministries of Economy and Finance, Social Affairs, Labor, Vocational Training and Youth \nRehabilitation, Women\u2019s and Veteran\u2019s Affairs,  Industry, Mines and Energy,  and other relevant \nministries  and  institutions  to  be  identified;  and  the  Garment  Manufacturers\u2019  Association  in \nCambodia will be established to provide overall guidance on policy issues and to support the TA. A \nTA implementation unit will be established under MOC for day-to-day management of the TA, to \nobtain  feedback  from  the  participants  in  the  workshops  and  pilot  activities,  and  to  explore \nopportunities for potential scaling up. \n \n20.  The TA will require a total of 25 person-months of consulting services, including 7 person-\nmonths  for  two  international  consultants  (trade  economist  and  social  development/gender \nspecialist)  and  18  person-months  for  a  domestic  consultant  (trade  and  poverty  expert).  The \nservices will cover the entire project implementation period of 18 months, from July 2003 until \nDecember 2004, with inputs of international consultants being provided on an intermittent basis. \nThe three consultants will be engaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Some office equipment (Component 5) and necessary supplies for Components 2 and \n3 (e.g., materials for skills training) will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \n21.  MOC will provide sufficient counterpart support, including counterpart staff, office space, \nand supplies for the consultant team. Under the supervision of the Secretary of State, MOC, the \nteam will conduct the study and implement the pilot projects.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government of \nCambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for the \npurpose  of  Preventing  Poverty  and  Empowering  Female  Garment  Workers  Affected  by  the \nChanging International Trade Environment, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
