INTRODUCTION \n1.  In the Pacific Approach,1 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes the need to \nimprove the supply and delivery of solid waste services in the Pacific. Pacific Island countries \nalso recognize the importance of and need for better solid waste management (SWM), as \nindicated by their adoption of the Pacific Regional Solid Waste Management Strategy 2010\u2013\n2015 (PRSWMS)2 at the November 2009 meeting of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional \nEnvironment  Programme  (SPREP).  They  committed  to  identifying  sustainable  financing \nmechanisms for SWM, implementing integrated SWM programs, passing required legislation, \nbuilding awareness, and building government and private sector capacity in SWM. Thirteen \nPacific developing member countries (DMCs)3 signed the PRSWMS and committed to adopting \ncost-effective,  self-sustaining  SWM  systems.  Timor-Leste\u2018s  national  development  plan  also \ncommits  to  introduce  urban  waste  management  guidelines,  establish  standards  for  waste \ntreatment in Dili and other main cities, and encourage composting and recycling.4 \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  Pacific  DMCs  fulfill  these  commitments  by \nreviewing their current SWM practices, identifying one or two prioritized initiatives for each \nPacific DMC from its national solid waste strategy,5 and preparing an outline proposal for pilot \ninvestment for these prioritized initiatives. The TA will also bring together SWM stakeholders at \na workshop to validate the outline proposals for pilot investment, examine progress made \ntowards implementing the PRSWMS, and discuss remaining challenges to be tackled during the \nlast two years of the PRSWMS. The TA has been prepared in consultation with Pacific DMC \ngovernments, SPREP, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the main donor \nin the sector in the Pacific. \n \n3.  The TA will help stakeholders take stock of the current situation in each Pacific DMC, \nidentify suitable solutions for investment, and gauge the progress made in implementing the \nPRSWMS. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Four main barriers to effective SWM in the Pacific have been identified: governance and \ninstitutional issues, technical challenges, the current lack of public awareness, and the need for \nfinancing. \n \n(i)  Governance  and  institutional  issues. Many Pacific DMCs face institutional \nbarriers to improving SWM services, including missing or poorly enforced policies \nand a lack of capacity to directly deliver SWM services or manage private or \ncommunity service providers. Because of these problems, different actors have \ntaken on the responsibility for SWM across the Pacific DMCs. In some DMCs, \nthe local or national government has the capacity to provide services directly. In \nothers, the solid waste industry is well developed and the private sector provides \n                                                \n1   Asian Development Bank. 2009.

Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011\u20132030. Dili. \n5  The national solid waste strategies of the Pacific DMCs are at various stages of preparation. Some Pacific DMCs \nhave strategies that are still under development; others have completed draft strategies; and still others have final \nstrategies approved by the relevant authority. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2018s website on 12 August 2011.  \n ", "2   \nSWM services. In still others, community groups, churches, and nongovernment \norganizations undertake SWM. However, the effectiveness and sustainability of \nSWM services in the Pacific is limited by the absence or weak enforcement of \nlegal and regulatory frameworks for collection, disposal, and treatment of solid \nwaste, as well as the weak planning and operational capacity of operators (public, \nprivate,  and  community)  and  regulators.  Customary  land  tenures  exacerbate \ninstitutional barriers by limiting the land available for SWM. \n(ii)   Technical challenges. Pacific DMCs face a number of technical challenges in \nSWM due to their small size, soil type, and isolation. These include \u2015increases in \nwaste generation caused by economic and population growth, limited availability \nof suitable land on small islands and atolls for landfill, and small and sometimes \nsparse populations which limit any potential economies of scale\u2016 (footnote 2). \nClimate change exacerbates these challenges. \n(iii)   Public awareness. Demand for SWM services varies within and between Pacific \nDMCs. In some cases, community demand for SWM services is low because of a \nlack  of  information  about  the  benefits  of  effective  SWM  and  a  reliance  on \nenvironmentally damaging, traditional waste disposal methods. In others, where \ndemand is strong, community groups, the private sector, or governments have \nstepped  in  to  provide SWM  services.  As  noted  in  the  PRSWMS,  not-in-my-\nbackyard attitudes impose restrictions on the availability of suitable land for SWM \nservices and infrastructure (footnote 2). Increased public awareness of the need \nfor  and  benefits  derived  from  effective  SWM  is  necessary  to  sustain \nimprovements in SWM. \n(iv)   Financing. Pacific DMCs face challenges in financing SWM systems because \nresidents  are  reluctant  to  pay  for  poor  service,  revenues  collected  are  not \nearmarked for SWM costs, and recycling off-island is expensive. These financing \nchallenges are exacerbated by several factors. First, the remoteness of many \nPacific DMCs results in high costs for consumables for waste management that \nmust  be  imported  (footnote  2).  Second,  many  Pacific  DMCs  are  not  taking \nadvantage of the potential revenue generation opportunities in composting and \nrecycling. Despite 58% of waste generated being biodegradable, solid waste is \nnot  commonly  composted  privately  or  at  landfills.  The  opportunity  to  reduce \nwaste  entering  landfills  through  composting  generally  remains  untapped. \nRecycling is more common than composting, but is very costly as it often means \nshipping  recyclable  waste  to  facilities  overseas.  Finally,  as  stated  in  the \nPRSWMS,  \u2015solid  waste  financing  has  not  kept  pace  with  growth  in  waste \nquantities\u2016(footnote 2).  \n \n5.  As a result of these four barriers, the majority of solid waste still ends up at landfill sites, \nwhich are often poorly managed, informal or illegal, and have negative environmental and \nhealth impacts.  \n \n6.  Following the endorsement of the PRSWMS, Pacific DMCs began work on national solid \nwaste strategies to guide their activities in this sector. They have been supported in this by the \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), JICA, and SPREP. JICA recently launched the \nProject for Promotion of Regional Initiative on Solid Waste Management (2011\u20132015). This \nbuilds on the success of its Solid Waste Management Project in Oceania Region (2006\u20132010), \nwhich  disseminated  the  good  practices  introduced  at  the  Tafaigata  landfill  in  Samoa  and \nsupported other Pacific island countries in preparing national SWM strategies. Under the 2011\u2013\n2015 project, JICA will continue to partner with SPREP to (i) implement the PRSWMS, for which \nSPREP remains the coordinating agency, (ii) support those Pacific DMCs that need to finalize \n ", "  3 \ntheir national solid waste strategies, and (iii) conduct training courses and pilot initiatives, such \nas the \u2015Vava\u2018u Semi-Aerobic Landfill Facility and Tonga Waste Reduction Campaign \u2013 3Rs\u2016 in \nTonga, which will improve final treatment facilities and reduce waste by recycling. AFD recently \nlaunched the Regional Initiative for Solid Waste Management in the Pacific Region. This project \nwill support the development and delivery of vocational training in waste management, develop \nframeworks for waste oil collection and disposal, and prepare country activity proposals in SWM. \n \n7.  The TA will work closely with active donors and agencies to (i) update the research and \ndata (which in many cases is 5\u201310 years out of date) that was used to prepare each national \nsolid waste strategy and the PRSWMS; (ii) prepare the outline proposals for pilot investments; \nand  (iii)  discuss  progress  made  in  implementing  the  PRSWMS  during  the  Pacific  SWM \nWorkshop.  By  evaluating  progress  made  to  date  and  preparing  outline  proposals  for  pilot \ninvestments for submission to donors, the TA will make an important contribution to the ongoing \nand future work of Pacific DMC governments and donors in the SWM sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be improved delivery of SWM. The outcome will be that key \nstakeholders  (government,  private,  and  civil  society)  in  Pacific  DMCs  have  an  increased \nunderstanding of SWM issues in the Pacific. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will support Pacific DMCs\u2018 goal to improve SWM by bringing together civil \nsociety organizations and government stakeholders to prioritize one or two initiatives in the \nsector from amongst the required actions outlined in the national strategies. An outline proposal \nfor pilot investment will then be prepared for each of the prioritized initiatives. \n \n10.  The TA has four outputs: (i) an update of the current situation in the SWM sector in \nPacific DMCs, (ii) agreement of Pacific DMCs for the outline proposals for pilot investment, (iii) \nsharing of Pacific DMC stakeholders\u2018 experiences on SWM issues, and (iv) dissemination of \nSWM knowledge products. The research conducted and disseminated by the TA, as well as the \noutline proposals for pilot investment, will increase stakeholders\u2018 awareness and understanding \nof SWM solutions in the Pacific. \n \n11.  The TA has five key activities that will be undertaken to achieve the outputs: \n \n(i)   Research. Consultants will be hired to work with Pacific DMC governments and \ncommunity stakeholders to survey current SWM practices in each Pacific DMC, \nand identify one or two priority initiatives from among those listed in each national \nsolid  waste  strategy.  For  each  Pacific  DMC,  the  consultants  will  update the \ninformation contained within each national strategy, following the four themes \nidentified  (governance  and  institutional  issues,  technical  challenges,  public \nawareness, and financing). Subjects to be researched include: waste generation, \ncollection,  transfer,  and  disposal;  technologies;  institutional  arrangements; \npolicies,  legislation,  and  standards,  including  monitoring  and  enforcement \nmechanisms;  service  delivery  providers,  including  public,  private,  community, \ninformal solid waste workers, and civil society; public education and awareness \ncampaigns;  approaches  to  different  types  of  solid  waste,  e.g.,  residential, \n ", "4   \ncommercial, urban, rural, public spaces, medical, hazardous, industrial, post-\ndisaster  clean-up;  programs  on  waste  reduction,  recycling,  composting,  and \nwaste-to-energy, including market demand for outputs of such programs; and \nfunding, costing, and revenue generation mechanisms, including carbon credits \nand clean development mechanisms. \n(ii)   Establishment  of  the baseline. Through their research, the consultants will \nestablish the baseline figures for the SPREP\u2018s SWM indicators and the project\u2018s \nperformance  indicators.  Additional  indicators  (and  baseline  data)  may  be \nproposed if required. \n(iii)   Priority  investments.  Through  community  meetings  and  discussions  with \ngovernments in each Pacific DMC, the consultants will validate their findings and \ndiscuss the selected priority initiatives to identify appropriate approaches and \nsolutions. An outline proposal for pilot investment that is \u2017donor-ready\u2018 will then \nbe prepared for each priority initiative. During consultations, the consultant will \ndeliver  basic  onsite  advice,  when  possible,  on  identified  priority  initiatives. \nStakeholders\u2018 capacity in preparing investment plans and designing investment \nprojects will be strengthened through their hands-on participation in preparing the \noutline proposal for pilot investment. \n(iv)   Workshop.  Government,  private  sector,  and  community  stakeholders  and \ndonors will be invited to a Pacific-wide workshop to (i) validate the consultants\u2018 \noverall research findings, (ii) provide feedback on the outline proposals for pilot \ninvestment for the priority initiatives in each Pacific DMC, (iii) evaluate progress \nmade  towards  implementing  the  PRSWMS,  and  (iv)  discuss  remaining \nchallenges to be addressed in the last two years of the PRSWMS. \n(v)   Knowledge products. Research findings will be compiled into a final report, \nwhich will be used to prepare a Pacific Studies Series publication. Both will be \nshared widely through stakeholder networks to increase awareness of SWM \nissues and outline pilot investment proposals for priority initiatives. \n \n12.  A key risk to the success of the TA is that proposed investment initiatives may be limited \nby a lack of available information on the research topics in certain Pacific DMCs. This risk will \nbe mitigated by widespread community consultations to gather local knowledge that may not be \navailable from traditional data sources. The TA assumes that Pacific DMC governments will \nagree with the recommended investment initiatives and research conclusions, and take the lead \nin seeking financing to further develop the proposals. To ensure these assumptions hold true, \nPacific DMC government representatives and other key stakeholders will be involved from an \nearly stage in data collection, prioritizing investment needs, and developing outline investment \nproposals. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2018s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF). The budget for the TA is $450,000, with $425,000 to be funded by TASF-other sources \nand $25,000 by TASF-IV. The participating governments will provide counterpart support in the \nform of office accommodation, transport, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, and \nothers. Cost estimates and the financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  TA  will  commence  on  1  December  2011  and  end  on  30  November  2013. \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \n ", "  5 \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will be the executing \nagency of the TA and will organize the Pacific SWM Workshop and similar activities. \n \n15.  The TA will require one international consultant with expertise in SWM and governance \nfor 9 person-months. The SWM and governance specialist will undertake the research, prepare \nthe outline proposals for pilot investment, organize the SWM workshop, and prepare the final \nreport and Pacific Studies Series publication. The international consultant will be assisted by 14 \nnational  consultants  as  research  assistants,  one  per  Pacific  DMC.  Each  national  research \nassistant will be engaged for 1 person-month and will coordinate research efforts, collect data, \nand arrange community meetings in each Pacific DMC. Outline terms of reference are provided \nin Appendix 3. Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Editing and \npublishing of the final report and Pacific Studies Series publication will be coordinated with \nADB\u2018s Department of External Relations.  \n \n16.  The TA will produce two key deliverables: (i) the international consultant\u2018s final report, \nwhich will include the outline proposal for pilot investment for each country\u2018s prioritized initiatives, \nand (ii) a Pacific Studies Series publication. Both knowledge products will be shared widely \nthrough stakeholder networks and during the Pacific SWM Workshop to increase awareness of \nSWM issues and present the outline proposals for pilot investment. Recipients will include \nPacific DMC governments, community and private sector stakeholders, regional stakeholders \nsuch as SPREP, and donors. ADB will evaluate these outline proposals for future ADB support \nto the SWM sector in discussion with Pacific DMC governments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.
