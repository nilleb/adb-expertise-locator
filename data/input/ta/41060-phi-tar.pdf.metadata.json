The Government of the Philippines has sought advisory technical assistance (TA) from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in continuing support of the country\u2019s implementation of the \nParis Declaration for Development Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, international \ncommitments to accelerate progress toward development effectiveness. The TA is included in \nthe  country  operations  business  plan  for  2007\u20132008  and  is  the  second  TA  to  support \ndevelopment effectiveness in the Philippines.1 The Fact-Finding Mission from 10 September to \n3 October 2008  reached  agreement  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference (TOR). The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Net official development assistance (ODA)3 to the Philippines in 2004\u20132006 averaged \n$524 million yearly, or about 0.5% of gross national income (GNI).4 This ratio is comparable to \nIndonesia\u2019s (0.5%) but lower than that in other Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia (8.8%), \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (11.5%), and Viet Nam (3.6%). ADB\u2019s share in total ODA to \nthe Philippines is about 20%. The Government realizes that, to develop the full potential of ODA, \nit must accelerate progress toward development effectiveness. The Government is a signatory \nto the Paris Declaration5 and has consistently shown strong ownership and leadership in \nimplementing the country\u2019s commitments. Processes meant to strengthen country systems were \nwell established even before the Paris Declaration was adopted. The Paris Declaration contains \na framework for monitoring progress in meeting the Paris Declaration commitments, including \ntargets for 2010. Government compliance has been monitored by the OECD6 and the country \nhas undergone a country evaluation.7 The monitoring has documented substantial progress, but \nhas also revealed areas that require further work, not only by the Government but also by \ndevelopment partners.8  \n \n3.  The  Government  is  also  a  signatory  to  the  Accra  Agenda  for  Action,9  which  was \nendorsed to further accelerate the implementation of the Paris Declaration commitments. The \nAccra Agenda for Action is centered on ways to ensure that developing countries (i) take the \nlead in and strengthen their capacity to determine their development strategies and organize \nprograms and processes to realize those strategies; (ii) build more effective and inclusive \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

The case study on the Philippines, which is summarized in Annex 7.12, includes sector studies \non rural development and health and was financed by German development cooperation through KfW.  \n8  The Government has so far achieved the 2010 targets for coordination of capacity development support, use of \ncountry procurement systems, and predictability. Further progress is needed in the reporting of aid in support of the \nbudget, use of public financial management systems, reduction in the number of parallel project implementation \nunits, use of program-based approaches, coordination of missions, and coordination of country analytical work.  \n9  The Accra Agenda for Action was adopted during the third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra, Ghana, \non 2\u20134 September 2008.  \n ", "2   \npartnerships for development; and (iii) enhance delivery and accounting for development results. \nThe Government is committed to implementing reforms in all three areas. \n \n4.  ADB  has  taken  a  leading  role  among  the  development  partners  in  supporting  the \nimplementation of Paris Declaration commitments in the Philippines. A TA for Harmonization \nand Managing for Results10 was implemented from March 2006 to May 2008 to help make \ndevelopment  more  effective  and  efficient  and  support  the  achievement  of  results.  A  key \nachievement  was  the  provision  of  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  the  Harmonization \nCommittee of the Government in drafting a country-led harmonization program. The committee \nis chaired by the Department of Finance (DOF) and has members from the National Economic \nand Development Authority (NEDA), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and \nthe Commission on Audit (COA). Harmonization agendas and action plans were drawn up to \nguide  reforms  in  procurement,  public  financial  management,  quality-at-entry  (environment, \ngender and development, land acquisition, and resettlement), managing for development results, \nand other areas.  \n \n5.  The latest progress review, made at a workshop in February 2008, concluded that there \nhas been progress in (i) preparing a harmonization action plan and baseline study; (ii) updating \nand implementing harmonized Government of the Philippines\u2013development partner procedures \nand guidelines for the national and local governments; (iii) updating the assessment of financial \nmanagement  and  audit  with  revised  guidelines  for  the  audit  of  foreign-assisted  projects; \n(iv) increasing the capacity of DBM and national agencies to bring the operations performance \nindicator  framework  into  the  development  mainstream;  (v)  preparing  and  implementing  a \nstreamlined  and  improved  environmental  impact  assessment  process;  (vi) improving  and \nimplementing harmonized gender and development guidelines; and (vii) preparing streamlined \nprocesses for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n6.  The implementation of the TA for Harmonization and Managing for Results brought out \nthe following lessons: (i) the Harmonization Committee must have greater capacity to assume \nits steering and coordination functions more effectively and sustainably; (ii) the harmonization \nframework and action plan must be further developed into a results-based framework and action \nplan that will be monitored regularly to complement the Paris Declaration monitoring system; \n(iii) once the Harmonization Committee gains increased capacity, ADB can be selective in \nproviding technical and financial support for activities covered by the action plan and will not \nneed to support the full range of activities. Those areas where there is strong demand from the \nHarmonization  Committee  and  where  ADB  has  a  comparative  advantage  over  other \ndevelopment partners should be emphasized.  \n \n7.  ADB and other development partners have supported Paris Declaration implementation \nin the harmonization of procurement regulations, the alignment of environmental safeguards, \ngender, and managing for development results, among other areas. Efforts are well under way \nto establish a program-based approach in the health sector. The Philippines has assumed \nleadership of ADB\u2019s developing member countries in Paris Declaration implementation and is \nseen  more  and  more  as  a  model  for  such  implementation.  The  concepts  of  government \nleadership, ownership, and alignment are taken more seriously in the Philippines than in many \nother countries and are increasingly interpreted as ownership of development programs beyond \ncentral government ownership. Such ownership assumes alignment of all external development \nactors  with  the  priorities  and  strategies  of  counterparts  in  the  sector  agencies  and  local \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005.

It also increasingly includes the notion of \u201cdemocratic\u201d ownership, by Congress \nand civil society organizations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  will  accelerate  progress  in  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \ndevelopment  in  the  Philippines.  Its  outcome  will  be  better-coordinated  and  accountable \nmanagement of the implementation of Paris Declaration commitments and other measures to \nstrengthen development effectiveness in the Philippines.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  five  outputs.  The  first  two  will  involve \nstrengthening the steering and coordination capacity of the Harmonization Committee, and the \nlast three, setting up specific procedures in oversight agencies or between oversight agencies \nand sector agencies to achieve development effectiveness. The TA implementation will begin \nwith output 1. Details of the sequencing of the other TA activities and more specific TOR for the \nconsultants will be worked out during the inception mission. \n \n10.  Output  1. An organizational setup that will enable the Harmonization Committee to \nassume  its  steering  and  coordination  functions  sustainably  for  greater  development \neffectiveness will be agreed on. To this end, the functions, capacity, and stakeholders of the \ncommittee will be assessed and an organizational setup that clearly distinguishes between the \nfunctions of the committee and related functions of oversight agencies will be recommended. \nThe assessment will cover (i) the role and institutional basis of the Harmonization Committee;11 \n(ii) the links between the functions of the committee and related functions of oversight agencies \n(a  clearer  definition  of  functions  will  be  recommended);  (iii)  the  capacity  of  the  technical \nsecretariat to support the functions of the Harmonization Committee (more realistic priorities and \nsequence of operating procedures in support of the steering and coordination functions of the \ncommittee  will  be  recommended);  and  (iv) options  for  better  coordination  between  the \nHarmonization Committee, oversight agencies, and other stakeholders, such as the Philippines \nDevelopment Forum. The findings and recommendations will be presented to the Harmonization \nCommittee for comment and decision.  \n \n11.  Output  2.  The  Harmonization  Committee  will  demonstrate  greater  ownership  and \nleadership and will steer and coordinate the activities of government agencies, development \npartners, and civil society organizations more efficiently and sustainably. High-quality policy \nadvice and other support will be provided to senior government officials on the Harmonization \nCommittee to enable them to steer the committee\u2019s activities more effectively. In particular, the \ncommittee will develop a well-prioritized, sequenced, and measurable results-based framework \nand action plan for development effectiveness at an initial workshop for important stakeholders, \nand will review the plan regularly. The committee will thus have a more systematic way of \nmeeting the Paris Declaration targets and prioritizing the activities. The implementation of the \nplan  will  be  discussed  with  government  agencies,  development  partners,  and  civil  society \norganizations at an annual conference. The committee will also approve and supervise the \nimplementation of the procedures developed and tested under output 3. \n \n                                                 \n11 The legal basis for the Harmonization Committee is a memorandum of understanding between oversight agencies. \n ", "4   \n12.  Output  3. Procedures for advocacy, mutual accountability, knowledge management, \ncapacity development, and monitoring and evaluation will be developed and tested selectively, \naccording to the priorities set in output 1. The Harmonization Committee must engage more \nactively with government agencies and development partners to speed up the achievement of \nParis Declaration commitments (advocacy function). There is also initial demand from civil \nsociety organizations for procedures that will allow them to be more effectively involved in \nmonitoring and overseeing key development projects in cooperation with government agencies \n(mutual  accountability  function).12  Similarly,  stakeholders  are  demanding  better  information \nabout  international  commitments,  ongoing  activities,  and  good  practices  (such  as  a \nprogram-based approach in the health sector) related to the implementation of Paris Declaration \ncommitments in the Philippines (knowledge management function). Targeted workshops and a \nHarmonization Committee website would meet this demand. The committee could also help \nidentify and prioritize capacity development support for sector agencies and local governments \nthrough oversight agencies. These procedures will be tested under the TA. The procedures for \nthe monitoring and evaluation of Paris Declaration commitments will be improved but are not \nexpected to be tested under the TA. The support will largely be provided through oversight \nagencies, which will also jointly host the technical secretariat of the Harmonization Committee.  \n \n13.  Output 4. Better-integrated, results-based sector planning and budgeting systems will \nbe developed, agreed on, and initially tested in the rural development sector. Better integration \nof sector plans and budgets is seen by many stakeholders as critical to achieving development \neffectiveness. The current weaknesses have been assessed and priority actions identified in \nvarious studies,13 and the rural development sector has been selected by the Government \nthrough  the  Harmonization  Committee  for  the  pilot-testing  of  an  integrated  system.  The \nimplementation  will  begin  with  a  workshop  in  results-based  management  concepts  for \nsecretaries of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), and the \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The output will be implemented in \nclose cooperation with the Philippines Development Forum working group on sustainable rural \ndevelopment.  \n \n14.  Output  5. Better harmonization and alignment of financial reporting procedures will \ncontinue the work started under the Harmonization and Managing for Results TA to align \ninconsistent  financial  reporting  procedures  within  the  Government  as  a  prerequisite  for \ndevelopment partner alignment around country systems. COA\u2019s Electronic New Government \nAccounting System (e-NGAS) will be harmonized with the eBudget system introduced by DBM. \nThe Harmonization Committee will see to it that the activities under this component are closely \ncoordinated with ongoing assistance funded by the United States Trade and Development \nAgency, the World Bank, and ADB. The degree of integration between the two systems will be \nassessed  and  options  for  improved  alignment  will  be  identified  and  tested  in  the  rural \ndevelopment  sector.  Requests  for  support  in  this  area  that  may  arise  during  project \nimplementation will be considered. \n                                                 \n12 This will help ADB and the Government to implement key recommendations of the Advisory Group on Civil Society \nand Aid Effectiveness at the country level.

The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $900,000 equivalent.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA \nfunding program. The Government, through DOF as Executing Agency, will contribute the local \ncurrency equivalent of $100,000 by providing office space and staff resources. The Fact-Finding \nMission was assured by the Government that the relevant counterpart facilities and resources \nwill be available as required according to the implementation schedule of the TA. A detailed cost \nestimate is in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  DOF, as chair of the Harmonization Committee, will act as Executing Agency of the TA, \nwith the committee defining a results-based development effectiveness framework and action \nplan  and  overseeing  its  implementation.  The  country\u2019s  progress  toward  development \neffectiveness will be prioritized and tracked against the plan. The Harmonization Committee, \nmade up of senior officials from DOF, NEDA, DBM, and COA, will also serve as the steering \ncommittee, overseeing the implementation and resolving policy issues related to the TA. The \ntechnical  secretariat  of  the  steering  committee,  with  technical  staff  representatives  from  \nmember agencies of the Harmonization Committee, will shepherd the efforts of the agencies \ninvolved and report on the progress of TA implementation. The steering committee will also \ncoordinate, facilitate, and supervise the work of the consultants, with the help of the technical \nsecretariat. The Implementing Agencies will be DOF, NEDA, DBM, COA, the Department of \nAgriculture,  DENR,  and  DAR.  The  consultants  will  work  directly  with  the  Harmonization \nCommittee and the relevant implementation agencies according to the agreed TOR for each \noutput. The agency concerned will commit one senior official and an appropriate number of \ntechnical staff to support policy, technical, and administrative work expected under the TA, and \nwill provide office space. A total of 10 person-months of international and 65 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be required. ADB, in coordination with the Government through \nDOF and with the supervision of the project officer, will directly recruit three international and \nfive national individual consultants, and will hire the consultants according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA \nwill conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.14 Indicative TOR for \nconsulting  services,  with  details  of  service  duration  and  reporting  arrangements,  are  in \nAppendix 3, but a certain level of flexibility must be maintained to allow ADB to respond to \nrequests made by the Harmonization Committee during TA implementation. The TA will be \nimplemented from February 2009 to December 2011 (34 months). \n17.  The expected outputs and the outcome evaluation will be made public through the \nHarmonization Committee website, which will be developed under the TA.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  Harmonization  and  Development  Effectiveness  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2008.
