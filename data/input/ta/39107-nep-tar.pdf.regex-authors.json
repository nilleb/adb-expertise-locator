His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal (the Government) is implementing the Tenth Plan \n(FY2003\u2013FY2007),  which  is  also  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  (PRS).  Its \nobjectives are to reduce chronic poverty and social exclusion. The plan is based on (i) broad-\nbased and higher economic growth, (ii) social development, (iii) targeted programs for excluded \ngroups, and (iv) good governance. The plan\u2019s implementation presents major challenges for the \nGovernment  because  of  the  ongoing  conflict  and  political  instability.  Together with other \ndevelopment  partners,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  helping  the  Government \nimplement the plan through a country strategy and program (CSP, 2005\u20132009)1, which is ADB\u2019s \nfirst pilot results-based CSP (RB-CSP). The CSP clearly links the strategic priorities of the plan, \nADB\u2019s operations to support the  priorities, and the results (outputs or outcomes) expected \nduring CSP implementation. These links reflect a results chain and are presented in a matrix. \nThe matrix represents the core of the  managing for development results  (MfDR) framework. \nSince the Government also expressed strong commitment to implement MfDR at the Marrakech \nand Paris high-level forums, it requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to develop \nthe capacity of government institutions to operationalize MfDR. The request was appropriate in \nlight of ADB\u2019s pilot RB-CSP. ADB therefore agreed to include an advisory TA in its 2005 country \nprogram, during the Country Program Confirmation Mission in December 2004.  \n \n2.  The objectives, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA2 were \ndiscussed with the Government and other key stakeholders during the Fact-Finding Mission3 on \n19\u201328 September 2005.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Aid  harmonization,  alignment,  and  development  effectiveness  (of  which  MfDR  is  a \ncomponent) are central themes emerging from the Monterrey and Marrakech meetings and the \nsuccessive Paris high-level forums. The international community and donors, including ADB, \nare fully committed to these themes.  The Paris Declaration envisages  developing member \ncountries  assuming  ownership  of  their  development  strategies  and  associated  operations \nframeworks. However, MfDR is a new concept and tool to enhance the impact and effectiveness \nof development and poverty reduction programs, and the Government does not have adequate \nexperience in this area. \n \n4.   The need to manage for better development results has come to the forefront of the \nglobal development agenda since the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development in \n2002,  and  the  Marrakech  Round  Table  on  MfDR  in  2004.  These  conferences  called  on \ndeveloping  countries  to  increase  their  commitment  to  policies  and  actions  that  promote \neconomic growth and reduce poverty. Despite several decades of external assistance, social \nindicators in large parts of the developing world have  remained poor.  Clearly, development \nassistance needs to be made more effective and aid flows enhanced to reduce poverty and \nachieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  With  the  high-level  forums  in  Paris  and  the \nadoption of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in March 2005, MfDR is progressing in \ndeveloping  countries.  The  planning  and  implementation  of  national  plans,  budgets,  and \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 August 2005. \n3 The Mission comprised mission leader B. Pant, principal regional cooperation specialist and results monitoring \nadvisor, Nepal Resident Mission (NRM); S. Ra,  senior country programs specialist, NRM; S. Shrestha,  senior \ngovernance and capacity building officer, NRM; and Md. Shahid Parwez, programs/project implementation officer, \nNRM.  S. Hafeez Rahman, country director, NRM provided overall guidance. \n ", "2    \nantipoverty strategies  are  becoming  increasingly  results-oriented.  With  the  MfDR  process, \ndeveloping countries are now  more responsible for coordinating donor assistance programs. \nDifferent donor agencies have been providing support to the Government in different forms and \nvarious magnitudes to implement MfDR. MfDR is a major change initiative, requiring a change \nin management strategy. The gradual institutionalization of results management would help \ngovernment  agencies  to  more  systematically  approach  strategy  development,  planning, \nresource allocation, and project and program implementation and monitoring. This would allow \nenhanced harmonization and alignment, and thus the delivery of more flexible and relevant \nforms of development assistance from the donor community.   \n \n5.  The Government, despite the complex political and security context, has taken steps to \ndevelop some core elements of MfDR. It has established an MfDR framework and mechanisms \nthat  link  planning,  budgeting,  project  and/or  program  implementation,  and  monitoring  to \ndevelopment  results  (outputs  and  outcomes).  While  the  PRS  provides  a  medium-term \ndevelopment strategy and priorities to reduce poverty, the medium-term expenditure framework \n(MTEF) provides an important basis to link the PRS to the annual budget  by  prioritizing \navailable resources. The immediate action plan (IAP) has institutionalized an annual process to \nimplement the priority reforms of PRS. A national  poverty monitoring and  analysis system \n(PMAS) has been developed, sector-specific business plans are being prepared, public service \ndelivery is being devolved in 14 pilot districts, and a district poverty monitoring and analysis \nsystem (DPMAS) has been created to introduce and streamline MfDR at different Government \ntiers. A project performance information system (PPIS)\u2014a tool to monitor physical and financial \nprogress of projects and programs\u2014has also been developed and is now operational in the \nNational Planning Commission (NPC). The DPMAS, PRS, IAP, MTEF, PMAS, and PPIS are \ncore elements of  the Government\u2019s MfDR process. However, these elements are yet to be \nsystematized and need to be streamlined with logical links in an MfDR framework at all \nGovernment levels. A clearly spelled-out MfDR approach would create greater acceptance of \nthe structures and systems already in place. \n  \n6.  These  Government  initiatives,  while  laudable,  are  challenging  to  sustain  and \ninstitutionalize  because  of  the  capacity  constraints  of  the  various  government  agencies. \nSignificant capacity building of key government institutions will be needed to implement the pilot \nRB-CSP of Nepal, which is also its priority. The challenge of building MfDR capacity in Nepal is \nmuch  larger,  more  demanding,  and  more  resource-intensive  than  in  other  countries. \nDevelopment  of  capacity  to  strengthen  performance  includes  the  gamut  of  skills,  from \nmonitoring, evaluation, financial management, specialized analytical and technical skills, as well \nas management\u2019s ability to make decisions based on monitoring information. ADB has been \nworking with key government agencies to promote understanding and use of MfDR.   \n \n7.  Given that MfDR is a new way of doing business and shifts the emphasis from inputs \nand processes to outputs, outcomes, and impacts,  long-term sustained capacity building of \nmultiple  government  agencies  will  be  required.  In  particular,  management  practices  and \nsystems  and  staff  competencies  will  require  major  strengthening.  However,  building  such \ncapacity needs to be carefully prioritized and focused to avoid an across-the-board attempt to \nreorient and reskill systems and staff in too many agencies and areas. Thus, prioritization, focus, \nand sequencing will be crucial to the TA\u2019s success.  \n \n8.  Nepal\u2019s monitoring and analysis systems have historically treated input monitoring as a \nstandard administrative task of line ministries and the NPC. Making the transition to MfDR has \nbeen an ongoing challenge given the institutional and technical limitations of  government \nagencies.  MfDR  is  resource-intensive,  requiring  a  significant  amount  of  consultations, \n ", "     3\nparticipatory processes, and iterative learning. The transition from a traditional input and output \napproach to focusing on outcomes is critical in implementing MfDR. Macro, meso, and micro \ninitiatives need to be linked  in the results-based  planning  and  implementation.  MfDR  can \nprovide a powerful reporting mechanism that can improve accountability of organizations and \nthe rigor of the oversight function. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  overall  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  help  the  Government  operationalize  and \ninstitutionalize MfDR to implement ADB\u2019s pilot MfDR CSP (2005\u20132009) approved in October \n2004. The TA will  help the  Government; (i) institutionalize  MfDR  approaches  within  NPC, \nselected line ministries, and district development committees (DDCs), (ii) develop sector-wide \nresults frameworks and action plans, and (iii) strengthen monitoring  and  evaluation (M&E) \nsystems in MfDR, including establishing focal points for results management in line ministries \nand selected DDCs. \n \n10.  The TA will  (i) introduce a culture of MfDR in  government agencies; (ii) facilitate the \nrealization of specific outputs, outcomes, and impacts in development work; and (iii) establish a \nmeasure of accountability in implementing development activities. The specific TA outputs are; \n(i) enhanced MfDR capacity of government agencies, mainly NPC, Ministry of Physical Planning \nand Works (MPPW), Ministry of Local Development (MLD), and three DDCs (in Jhapa, Dang, \nand Jumla); (ii) development of results frameworks and actions plans for the selected line \nministries, and identification of relevant output and outcome indicators at  the national and \ndistrict  levels;  (iii)  development  of  methodologies  and  operational  tools  for  MfDR;  (iv) \ninstitutionalization of MfDR by building on existing DMPAS in the selected  three  districts; \n(v) replication of PPIS in two line ministries; and (vi) strengthened institutional mechanism for \nimplementing  MfDR  in  selected  national  and  district  government  agencies.  The  two  line \nministries4  and  three  DDCs  were  selected  based  on  their  capacity  to  implement  MfDR \napproaches and relevance of ADB operation. The three selected DDCs are among 14 districts \nwhere the Government has launched full devolution. Jhapa, Dang, and Jumla are in the eastern, \nwestern  and  mid-western  development  regions,  respectively,  each  with  unique  physical, \neconomic, and sociocultural characteristics. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.   Institutionalization  of  MfDR. MfDR\u2019s success depends on organizations\u2019 ability to \ncreate  a  management  culture  focused  on  results.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government \noperationalize MfDR in NPC, MPPW, MLD, and the selected three districts. Operationalizing \nMfDR  will  include  (i)  assessing  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  by  identifying  the \nconstraints and needs for the effective implementation of an MfDR process; (ii) developing and \nadopting  methodologies,  mechanisms,  and  systems  to  mainstream  MfDR;  (iii)  helping  the \nGovernment  pilot  MfDR  practices  and  systems;  (iv)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  staff  and \ninstitutions in specific areas needed to mainstream MfDR through learning institutions and \nnetworking; and (v) creating Government awareness and ownership by organizing workshops, \nseminars, and sharing information with a wider audience. \n                                                 \n4 MPPW and MLD participated actively and effectively during the Results Framework Review Mission. MLD also \nparticipated in ADB. 2005. Study on Capacity Development in South Asia. Manila. \n ", "4    \n \n12.  Development  of  a  Sector-Specific  Results  Framework.    The  results  framework \npresents a logical relationship among outputs, outcomes, and strategic development goals. Key \nto its success is stakeholder involvement throughout the management cycle in defining realistic \nexpected results, assessing risk, monitoring progress, reporting on performance, and integrating \nlessons learned in management decision making. Through its first pilot results-based CSP, ADB \nwill help  the Government and donor community  (i) think through the country\u2019s development \nagenda, (ii) increase selectivity and focus, and (iii) more clearly define expected outcomes. The \nTA will help the Government strengthen the development framework by developing a sector-\nspecific MfDR strategy to be implemented nationally and locally. The sector-specific strategies \nwill help achieve the broader objectives of the overall development framework.  \n \n13.  Strengthening M&E. The Government\u2019s M&E systems are linked to various planning \nand budgeting processes. The M&E system needs to be strengthened and to be extended to \nnational and local outcomes and outputs. This requires capacity-building initiatives to be tailored \nto the country\u2019s institutional context, and M&E dimensions to be fed back into program design. \nThe TA will help the Government establish such a link in the existing M&E divisions/units of the \nselected line ministries and DDCs in monitoring and providing critical real-time feedback on \ndelivery of development results. A detailed implementation and monitoring action plan will be \ndeveloped to monitor the results framework. The TA aims to improve the institutional capacity of \nDDCs to pilot the MfDR-selected districts by providing training. The PPIS has been developed \nto monitor physical and financial progress of projects and is now operational in NPC; it will be \ninstitutionalized  in  the  selected  line  ministries  to  give  more  results focus  to  government \ninitiatives.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the proposed TA will be $500,000. ADB will provide $400,000 on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s Support of Managing for Development Results Cooperation Fund and \nthe  Government  will  contribute  counterpart  funding  of  $100,000.  The  TA  will  finance  the \nservices of international and domestic consultants, procurement of equipment, international and \nlocal short-term training for the staff of NPC, selected line ministries and DDCs, and partial \nsupport for organizing workshops. Cost estimates for these are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented by NPC, which will also be the Executing Agency (EA). NPC \nwill implement the TA through MLD, MPPW, and DDCs. A focal point specially tasked to \nimplement activities under the TA will be established within the M&E divisions of MLD, MPPW, \nand three selected DDCs. The Under Secretary, Poverty Monitoring Division, will be the project \ndirector,  and  be  responsible  for  monitoring  project  implementation  activities,  supervising \nconsultants, and reviewing their outputs. The line ministries and DDCs will also appoint senior \nofficials for project implementation and coordination with NPC in their agencies.  \n \n16.  The Government will establish a steering committee chaired by the NPC vice chair. The \nmembers will be  MLD secretaries concerned, MPPW, representatives of the selected DDCs, \nand the project director. The steering committee will guide  TA implementation. The  project \ndirector  will  function  as  the  member  secretary  of  the  steering  committee.  The  steering \ncommittee will be assisted by technical committees, to be formed as needed.   \n \n \n ", "     5\n17.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, from March 2006 to February 2008. The TA \nwill have a total of 35 person-months of consultancy (5 person-months\u2019 international and 30 \nperson-months\u2019 domestic). All consultants will have extensive experience in MfDR. A consulting \nfirm will be hired to provide the services. The consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nDomestic consultants with sector-specific knowledge and experience in results management will \nbe recruited. The international consultant will be employed on an intermittent basis and will be \nresponsible for recruiting the domestic consultants and organizing training. The consultants will \nsubmit (i) an inception report within 1.5 months after the TA starts, (ii) progress reports every \n3.0 months, (iii) a draft final report after the core TA activities are completed, and (iv) a final \nreport after ADB\u2019s comments are incorporated. The consultants will provide all the reports to the \nEAs (three copies) and ADB (three copies).  \n \n18.  The TA will provide limited computer equipment, which will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and handed over to agencies concerned upon the TA\u2019s \ncompletion. Needs-based capacity will be developed. The TA will support short-term local and \nexternal training; study tours; and exposure to the best practices in MfDR so that the staffs of \nNPC, MLD, MPPW, and DDCs can learn from the experience of other countries in the region. \nThe institutions and individual participants will be selected based on organization, competency, \nand institutional assessments. Upon completion of the training, the trainees will submit a \ncomprehensive report on the training\u2019s achievements to the heads of their organizations, with a \ncopy to ADB and the Ministry of Finance.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Support of Managing for Development Results \nCooperation Fund  for Operationalization of Managing for Development Results, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nDevelopment effectiveness  \u2022  MfDR capacity of  \u2022  Mission reviews  Government \nachieved in the context of  government agencies  \u2022  Official  willing to adopt \nbroad-based economic  strengthened  communications  MfDR agenda in \ngrowth through improved  \u2022  Institutional  and reports  public sector \nconnectivity of different parts  mechanism for public  \u2022  Official government  undertakings \nof the country  sector management  statistics   \nand accountability  Risks  \nenhanced  Inadequate \n\u2022  Rural access to public  commitment \nservices improved  among \n  government \nofficials \nConflict may \ndelay \nachievement of \ntargets \nOutcome      Assumption \nMfDR approach adopted in  \u2022  Organizational  \u2022  Review  Government's \nNPC, two line ministries, and  strategy and practices  assessment of TA  willingness to \nthree DDCs   for MfDR introduced in  progress  adopt MfDR in \nselected government  \u2022  Official  day-to-day \nagencies  communication  operations \n\u2022  MfDR guidelines for  reports   \nlinking planning,  Risk \nbudgeting, and M&E  Delays in \nexercises  appointment of \nimplemented at all  key counterpart \nlevels  staff \nOutputs       \n\u2022  Institutionalization of  \u2022  Development of MfDR  \u2022  Assessment of TA  Assumption \nMfDR   tools and  progress  Government's \n\u2022  Development of sector- methodologies at  \u2022  Official  commitment to \nspecific results framework  different Government  communication  adopt changed \n\u2022  Strengthening of M&E  levels  report  systems and \nsystem  \u2022  Sector-specific results  \u2022  Official government  processes \n  framework prepared  statistics  ensure available \nby 2007    and reliable data \n\u2022  MfDR-focused M&E   \nsystem introduced  Risk \n  Data on the \nidentified \nindicators may \nnot be available \nregularly  \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n  ADB \n1.1 Establish steering committee   \u2022  Government staff time and expertise: \n1.2 Establish links between national plans and strategies,  $70,000 \nresource allocation, and implementation  \u2022  Government accommodation and utilities: \n1.3 Develop a strategy to introduce MfDR in the selected  $30,000 \ngovernment agencies  \u2022  Local experts: $101,000 \n  \u2022  International experts: $75,000 \n2.1 Conduct inception and concluding workshops;   \u2022  Travels: $20,000 \nprepare an inception report  \u2022  Training, workshops, and conferences: \n2.2 Train government officials to understand and use \n$114,000 \nMfDR  \u2022  Equipment: $30,000 \n2.3 Streamline Government systems and processes to \n\u2022  Contingencies: $50,000 \nimplement MfDR \n\u2022  Overhead and field visits: $10,000 \n2.4 Implement pilot programs in two line ministries and \n\u2022  Total: $500,000 \nthree districts \n2.5 Help the line ministries prepare results frameworks \nand business plans and improve their results \norientation \n2.6 Identify indicators, set targets and milestones, and \nspecify data sources for results-based monitoring, \nincluding poverty and MDGs \n \n3.1 Develop operations guidelines to mainstream MfDR in \ngovernment agencies/donor-assisted projects at \nnational, sectoral, and local levels \n3.2 Develop a plan to monitor MfDR initiatives  \n3.3 Draft and final reports \n \n DDC = district development committee, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, MDGs = Millennium Development Goals, MfDR \n= Managing for Development Results, and NPC = National Planning Commission.  \n \n \n             \n ", "", " 8           Appendix 2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ \u2018000) \n \nForeign  Local  Total     \nItem \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
