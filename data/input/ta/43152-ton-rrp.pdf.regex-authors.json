No  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  is \nAssessment  anticipated. \n \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected.  \n \nRationale and  Just  as  Tonga's  economy  began  to  recover  from  recent  domestic \nDescription  shocks\u2014the  civil  service  strike  in  2005  and  civil  disturbances  in \n2006\u2014and the impact of global economic developments such as high \noil and food prices in 2008, the prospects for economic growth have \ncome under increasing pressure as a result of the global economic \ncrisis. Recent recorded declines in remittances, a significant slump in \ntrade tax receipts, weak export demand, declining tourism revenues, \nand  weakening  of  credit  flow  within  domestic  banking,  show  that \nTonga is now clearly feeling the impact of the crisis, somewhat sooner \nand  to  a  greater  extent  than  initially  expected.  The  Government \nrevised projected revenue for FY2010 down by 18.6%, to T$140.1 \nmillion from T$172.2 million. Government is forecasting a fiscal deficit \nof 10.3% of gross domestic product (GDP). As a result of this expected \ndecline in revenue, as well as recent poor agriculture and tourism data, \nthe Government revised its GDP growth forecast for FY2010 down to \n0.4% (from 1.7%).  \n \nTo maintain fiscal responsibility in the short term, while ensuring social \nsector expenditure is protected, the Government will need to reduce \nplanned  expenditure,  and  continue  critical  reforms  to  address \nunderlying structural constraints. If these constraints are not removed, \nsound fiscal management and increased economic resilience will not \nbe  achievable.  Possible  Government  responses  comprise  fiscal, \nstructural, and social policy measures, supported by prudent monetary \npolicy. ", "ii   \n \nThe Government will need budget support to (i) protect essential social \nexpenditure for segments of society most adversely affected by the \ncrisis,  and  (ii)  advance  structural  reforms  to  improve  medium-term \ncompetitiveness and productivity.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The impact will be higher and more inclusive economic growth. The \nmain outcome will be a timely and effective response to the crisis. \n \nSpecial Features  The program provides a quick-disbursing response to the impact of the \ncrisis. This is a priority need as Government expected a longer lag \nbefore the impacts of the crisis were felt; however, the impacts are \nnow being observed and as a result the planned FY2010 budget is \nunder significant pressure. The program also supports implementation \nof an extensive public and private sector reform agenda that is geared \nto improving productivity, and medium-term growth prospects. ADB \nhas been engaged in these program areas over the past 5 years and \nhas underpinned Government actions with significant analytical work \nand ongoing technical engagement, especially in the areas of public \nfinancial sector management, structural reform, and infrastructure. The \nprogram  supports  implementation  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  Tonga,  and  links  into \npartnerships with other development agencies.  \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a grant of $10,000,000 from ADB's Special Funds \nresources. Factors that have been taken into account in determining \nthe grant size include the projected magnitude of the economic, fiscal, \nand social impact of the global economic crisis on Tonga; the scope \nand fiscal implications of an effective policy response to the crisis; and \nthe Government's continued commitment to a significant economic and \npublic sector reform agenda. \n \nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by \nthe grant will be used to continue support towards implementation of \nstructural  and  public  financial  management  reform  measures,  and \nprotection of core social expenditure. \n \nTranching  The grant will be released in two tranches. The first tranche ($5 million) \nwill  be  released  upon  grant  effectiveness,  the  condition  for \neffectiveness being that all first tranche conditions will have been met \nto the satisfaction of ADB. The second tranche ($5 million) will be \nreleased as soon as ADB is satisfied with progress in implementing the \nprogram, in particular, that all the second tranche conditions are met. \nThe indicative timing for release of the second tranche is November \n2010. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The grant proceeds are expected to be fully used by December 2010.  \n \nEstimated Program  Program completion is estimated in June 2011. \nCompletion Date \n ", "  iii\nExecuting and  The Prime Minister's Office is the executing agency. The Ministry of \nImplementing  Finance and National Planning; the Ministry of Public Enterprises; the \nAgencies  Ministry of Labor, Commerce and Industry; and the Ministry of Health, \nwill be the implementing agencies. \n \nProcurement and  Grant proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \nDisbursement  countries, other than the items specified in the list of ineligible items \nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The \nproceeds of the program grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated requirements for program loans and grants. Grant proceeds \ndisbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the \nGovernment stipulating that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the \namount  of  ADB's  projected  disbursements  under  the  grant  for  the \ngiven period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant proceeds \nto verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nProgram Benefits  In  light  of  the  crisis,  the  program  provides  the  Government  with \nand Beneficiaries  additional financial resources to support the protection of the most \nvulnerable members of society from the impacts of the crisis, and to \ncontinue with structural reforms which will promote economic growth \nand the maintenance of stability. \n \nRisks and  The program is built around the Government's commitment to address \nAssumptions  the  crisis  by  exerting  budgetary  prudence,  while  maintaining  core \nsocial expenditure, and continuing with its extensive structural reform \nprogram.  The  main  risks  are  capacity  related  and  political.  The \nprogram relies on the private sector responding positively to structural \nreforms and improved global economic conditions; and government \nagencies  committing  to  improving  performance  and  having  the \ncapacity  to  implement  the  substantial  reform  agenda.  Since  early \n2009,  private  sector  response  to  the  Nuku'alofa  reconstruction \nmeasures  following  the  2006  civil  disturbance  has  increased \nconsiderably.  Government  agencies  have  demonstrated  sufficient \nabsorptive capacity especially for structural reform, as demonstrated \nby  recent  progress.  The  program  continues  the  process  of  reform \nwhich ADB engagement has facilitated over the past 5 years. The \nprogram  is  harmonized  with  the  relevant  activities  of  development \npartners.  The  ongoing  reform  process  and  the  support  generated \nwithin the civil service and the private sector is partly addressing the \nrisk of shifts in political attitudes and commitment given the general \nelections scheduled for late 2010. Political commitment to structural \nreform is high in Tonga; the program components will be implemented \nby  the  time  of  the  general  elections.  A  postprogram  monitoring \nframework  will  be  instrumental  in  maintaining  the  program\u2019s \nmomentum and sustainability over the medium term. \n \n ", "150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W 174o  00'W\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\nP2h0io Sl i0ep0apR'NiEnPeUBLIC FEDERATED STATES OF MARSHALL  ISLANDS International  Dateline PACIFIC  REGION 20o  00'N TFooknuu alei 175 o 40'W\nOF PALAU MICRONESIA\n0o 0o\nNAURU\nK     I     R     I     B     A     T     I NIUAFO'OU\nPAPUA\nNEW GUINEA SOLOMON 15o  35'S\nISLANDS TUVALU\nSAMOA\nCOOK\nC o r a l   S e a VANUATU ISLANDS VAVA'U\nREPUBLIC TONGA\n20o  00'S OFF ITJHIE 20o  00'S Hunga Neiafu\nISLANDS\nKapa\nA U S T R A L I A S o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n Nuapapu\n150 o 00'E 170 o 00'W\nV  A  V  A  ' U    G  R  O  U  P\n19 o 00'S 175 o 30'W 19 o 00'S\nTONGA\nECONOMIC SUPPORT\nS  O  U  T  H      P A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\nPROGRAM\n174o  00'W\nN\nTafahi\nOfolanga\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nKao Mo'unga'one  Ha'ano \nKilometers 16o  00'S 16o  00'S\nTofua Foa NIUATOPUTAPU\nPangai\nNational Capital LIFUKA\nTown Uoleva 174o  00'W\nAirport Kotu Uiha and Felemea\nRoad O'ua Uonukuhahake\nMatuku\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nH A 'A P A I     G R O U P\nNomuka Fonoifua\nTelekivava'u\nFalcon Mango Lalona\nTelekitonga\nTonumea\nHunga Tonga Kelefesia\nHunga Ha'apai \no\n174  00'W\n175 o 10'W\n'Atata\nAta\nT O N G A T A P U    G R O U P Ha'atafu\n21o  00'S 21o  00'S 21o  0H0a'S'akili Polo'a Fafa Onevai Fukave 21o  00'S\n'Atata Ha'avakatolo Motutapu\nNUKU'ALOFA Te'ekiuNukunuku NUKU'ALOFA Navutoka Kolonga Eueiki\n'Euaiki\nTalafo'ou Niutoua\nTONGATAPU  Ha'utu\nPea\nHouma\n176 o 13'W Mu'a\nUtulau\n22o  21'S 'EUA Vaini\n'Ata Fatumu\nKalau TONGATAPU\nHa'asini and Hamula\n175 o 30'W 175 o 10'W Fua'amotu\n09-4287 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  for  the  Economic Support  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter and policy matrix is in Appendix 2. \nII.  THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS \nA.  Impacts on Tonga \n2.  Tonga, like other small, remittance-dependent economies in the Pacific region is highly \nvulnerable to domestic and external shocks. Over the past decade, real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth averaged 1.8% per annum\u2014well below the regional average of 3.2%. Underlying \nstructural constraints, political disturbances, and global economic developments restricted the \npace and depth of growth. While agriculture and fishing remain the largest contributors to overall \noutput\u2014accounting for 20% of total output\u2014their importance is diminishing relative to the sharp \ngrowth in services led by communications and tourism, coupled with recent poor export prices \nand fishing conditions (Appendix 3). \n \n3.  Tonga\u2019s private sector is relatively small and its development nascent. The public sector \nis large and public enterprises have traditionally occupied sizable portions of productive sectors \nof the economy, controlling around 20% of fixed assets yet contributing only 6% to GDP.1 \nPrivate sector growth has been further constrained by excessive regulation and discretionary \nlicensing requirements. Efforts to diversify Tonga's economic base, and to implement structural \nreforms to increase overall productivity and improve the economy's resilience, remain critical. \n \n4.  In FY2008, Tonga's economy grew by 2.7%\u2014the highest growth rate registered since \nFY2002\u2014driven by expansion in construction, transport and communications, and finance and \nreal estate. However, sharp increases in the price of fuel in the second half of 2008, as well as \nthe decline in recorded remittances as global conditions weakened, placed renewed pressure \non  the  economy  and  highlighted  structural  weaknesses  that  need  to  be  more  completely \naddressed. \n \n5.  The  global  economic  crisis  has  adversely  affected  Tonga's  economy,  and  GDP \ncontracted by 0.5% in FY2009. This contraction has put added pressure on the fiscal position. \nJust 2 months into FY2010 (end of August 2009), the budget outturn showed a fiscal deficit of \nT$7.5 million (1.0% of GDP) based on a significant decline in government revenue, particularly \ntrade taxes (which closely track remittance trends) which declined by 18.9%\u2014 a budget shortfall \nof T$19.0 million\u2014over the first two months of FY2010. This contraction resulted in a severe \ncash shortage, and will impact government expenditure programs unless the Government takes \nsteps to reprioritize spending (paras. 18\u201324 and Appendix 4). Only a weak recovery of 0.4% is \nforecast for FY2010, premised on growth in nonexport agriculture, and the flow-through effects \nof government expenditure.2  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

The impact of the global economic crisis is reflected in the following: \n(i)  Revenue. Government revenue has shown a declining trend over the past 18 \nmonths as private expenditure and incomes have fallen. Tax revenue (primarily \nincome tax and consumption tax) comprises around 80% of total revenue. While \ntrade taxes (25% of total revenue) have declined by 5.6% year-on-year, the rate \nof decline has increased in FY2010 with total revenue falling 18.9% in the first \ntwo months of the fiscal year (Figure 1). Actual collections at the end of August \n2009 necessitated a revised revenue forecast for FY2010. Revenue projections \nfor  FY2010  were  revised  down  18.6%  to  $T140.1  million,  from  the  FY2010 \nbudget estimate of T$172.2 million. \n(ii)  Remittances. Remittances, which traditionally account for 31% of GDP, have \nfallen sharply. In the 12 months to July 2009, remittances fell by 17% to around \n22%  of  GDP.  The  flow  of  remittances\u2014both  cash  and  in-kind\u2014provides  an \nimportant source of household income and social protection for many Tongans.3 \n(iii)  Exports. Decline in commodity prices as well as, more recently, weak global \ndemand  have  quickly  lowered  incomes  for  smallholders  and  plantations. \nAgriculture, fishing and forestry account for around 62% of exports by value. \nMoreover, Tonga's export base has shrunk as smallholders have shifted to root \ncrops for domestic consumption and subsistence farming. On a year-on-year \nbasis,  nonexport  agriculture  increased  by  80%  in  FY2009  while  export \nagriculture\u2014primarily squash, vanilla, and fish\u2014fell by 35%. \n                                                 \n3  A World Bank survey found that in 2004, more than 90% of households in the country received remittances. On \naverage, the annual remittance flow amounted to $3,067 per household (or $745 per person).  \n ", "  3\n(iv)  Household incomes. Overall household spending has declined as rural incomes \nhave  weakened,  and  as  the  flow  of  remittances  declined.  Import  demand \ndeclined by around 35% in the year to July 2009. \n(v)  Tourism.  Tourism,  which  accounts  for  about  10%  of  GDP,  has  weakened. \nTourist arrivals at the end of July 2009 declined by 2% on a year-on-year basis, \nwhile tourist receipts fell by 13.5% over the same period. \n(vi)  Business activity. The slowdown in the economy and weakened demand for \ntourism  appears  to  be  impacting  retailers  in  urban  areas,  several  reported \ndeclines of 30%\u201340% in sales in the first quarter of 2009. In line with weakened \ndomestic demand, the commerce subsector (largely retail and wholesale traders) \ndeclined by 6% in FY2009. The results of the Tonga Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry survey, conducted in the first half of 2009, indicates that more than 70% \nof  businesses  believe  that  the  overall  business  environment  in  Tonga \ndeteriorated over the previous 12 months.4 Inventories have risen, nonpayment \nof trade credit has become an issue, and access to finance has deteriorated \ngiven the more rigorous lending criteria adopted by the banking system. More \nthan  half  of  the  businesses  surveyed  attributed  the  subdued  commercial \nenvironment to the crisis.  \n \n7.  While recent data on poverty and hardship is not currently available (a new household \nincome and expenditure survey is under way5), subdued economic conditions, combined with \nthe  significant  decline  in  remittances,  will  likely  translate  into  higher  unemployment  and \nincreased hardship for the poor and vulnerable. The lack of formal social protection systems is \nlikely to compound impacts on the poor and vulnerable, although subsistence farming offers \nsome relief. Tonga does have the advantage of free health and education services to help \nreduce social impacts, which otherwise might have arisen due to reduced access. \n \n8.  Weak revenue performance will place significant pressure on government expenditure \nprograms. This in turn has the potential to add to pressure on the most vulnerable members of \nthe  community  from  an  easing  in  labor  demand  and  the  high  cost  of  living.  Women  are \nparticularly exposed as they are often overrepresented in lower-paid jobs in most sectors of the \neconomy, in particular handicraft production, which form the basis for a significant part of \nremittance flows. An in-depth analysis of the social impacts of the crisis is needed to design, \npilot, and implement appropriate social protection measures.6 \n \n9.  Following the civil unrest in November of 2006, the Government made a significant effort \ntoward securing financing for the reconstruction of the capital city, Nuku\u2019alofa. This includes \ndonor  grants  of  about  T$15  million,  which  were  channeled  through  designated  banks  to \nbusiness entities affected by the riots in the form of off-budget, low interest rate loans in the \nsecond half of FY2008. The Government also signed a long-term T$120 million reconstruction \nloan  from  the  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  China  (China  Eximbank)  in  November  2007. 7 \nDisbursements of this loan were initially postponed, as the Government sought to ensure it was \nused productively, and while it negotiated for use of local inputs. The first drawdown of T$40 \nmillion was made in April 2009. It is the Government's intent to use loan proceeds in broadly \n                                                 \n4  Tonga Chamber of Commerce and Industry. http://www.tongachamber.org \n5  The last household income and expenditure survey for Tonga was undertaken in 2001. Preliminary analysis of the \nnew survey should be available by the end of 2009.  \n6  ADB is considering such an initiative on a regional basis for selected Pacific developing member countries \n(including Tonga) affected by the global economic crisis.   \n7  The loan, which bears a 2% interest rate, will be repaid over 20 years with a 5-year grace period. \n ", "4   \nequal measure to finance public works in the capital and to onlend to the private sector for office \nand retail construction. \n \n10.  According to the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV mission, Tonga \nremains at high risk of debt distress. Nonetheless, the projected debt profile is consistent with \nmanageable\u2014if high risk\u2014debt dynamics. Under the baseline scenario, the ratios of net present \nvalue of debt to GDP as well as the net present value of debt to export remain above the \ncountry-specific indicative thresholds for a prolonged period.8 Tonga\u2019s total public sector debt \nstock (including publicly guaranteed debt) declined to 34% of GDP in FY2008 from 40% of GDP \nin FY2006. External debt to GDP also fell by about 11.3%, while fiscal consolidation contributed \nto a downward trend in domestic public debt to GDP. At the same time, Tonga benefits from \nvery high remittance inflows, which are by far the largest source of foreign exchange earnings \nand help mitigate liquidity risks. Tonga\u2019s overall public sector debt indicators, while elevated \nover the short term, show a decreasing trend over the longer run. \n \n11.  The IMF staff report warns that any drawdowns on loans will lead to high-risk debt over \nthe medium term, and any additional external borrowing should be strictly limited. Reflecting \nthis, during the IMF board's consideration of the Article IV report, Tonga's representative stated \nthat \"authorities have been able to secure an additional concessional loan amount of $45 million \nfor infrastructure development recently. However, it is realized that the disbursement schedule \nneeds to be modified to avoid the increase in risk of debt distress.\"9  \n \n12.  The IMF concludes that taking into account the cushion provided to the economy by the \nhigh workers\u2019 remittances, the projected debt profile is consistent with manageable\u2014if high \nrisk\u2014debt dynamics. The results of the debt sustainability analysis underscore the importance \nof maintaining broadly balanced budgets following the completion of reconstruction borrowing \nand sustaining growth near or above historical averages. Both are key to maintaining stable \ndebt  in  the  medium  term  and  declining  debt  in  the  long  term.  Additionally,  prudent  debt \nmanagement policies, including keeping within sustainability parameters, must be adopted to \nminimize exposure to risk (and the potential for debt distress). \n \nB.  The Government's Response  \n1.  Monetary Policy \n13.  Prior  to  June  2009,  the  National  Reserve  Bank  of  Tonga  (NRBT)  adopted  a  tight \nmonetary policy stance to ensure achievement of its principal objectives to maintain internal and \nexternal monetary stability, and promote a sound and efficient financial system. This stance \nachieved its desired effects as foreign reserves continued to increase and inflation declined. \n \n14.  Credit  to  the  private  sector  declined  in  FY2009  by  2.9%  as  commercial  banks \nsubstantially tightened lending criteria in response to substantial bad debts (incurred prior to the \n                                                 \n8  This scenario assumes that the real GDP growth rate will revert close to its historical average following a slowdown \nin FY2009 and FY2010. The reconstruction loan will be drawn down over 4 years. Excluding reconstruction \nspending, public spending will be broadly limited to projected revenues and grants over the medium term, and will, \nthus, minimize additional external borrowing. Although exports are expected to remain constrained, remittances, \nwhich are the largest source of foreign exchange earnings, are expected to remain an important external cushion \nover the medium term.  \n9  IMF. 2009. Statement by Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Tonga and Dicky Kartikoyono, Senior \nAdvisor to Executive Director, Executive Board Meeting 09/92, 4 September.  \n ", "  5\ncrisis).10 As economic conditions rapidly worsened, NRBT moved to ease credit conditions. \nHowever, effectiveness of monetary policy in responding to the crisis is limited due to weak \ntransmission  mechanisms  and  the  pegged  exchange  rate.11 Nonetheless,  NRBT  reduced \nreserve requirements for commercial banks from 10% to 5% and has, more recently, taken the \ninitiative to bring down lending rates by requesting banks\u2019 to review their lending margins.12 \nHowever, overall credit growth continues to be constrained. \n \n15.  Further  monetary  policy  easing  remains  an  option,  as  foreign  reserves  were  at  \n5.4 months of import cover as of July 2009, in part due to reduced imports. Inflation continues to \nabate. \n \n2.  Fiscal Measures \n16.  The Government\u2019s fiscal policies are aligned with the outcomes and objectives set out in \nthe  new  National  Strategic  Planning  Framework.13 The  Government  has  committed  to  the \nfollowing fiscal parameters over the medium term:14  \n(i)  operate responsible and prudent fiscal and monetary policies;  \n(ii)  base revenue policy on providing equal opportunities for all;  \n(iii)  ensure that the national debt remains sustainable, as appropriate;  \n(iv)  move to more efficient and effective government and the transfer of resources to \nimprove services and maintain assets;  \n(v)  continue its public enterprise rationalization process;  \n(vi)  ensure revenue collection methods are effective and nondistortionary; and  \n(vii)  apply  a  coordinated  whole-of-government  approach  to  development  partner \nfunding.  \n \n17.  The Government, in setting its FY2010 budget, recognized that the economy would be \nvulnerable to the global downturn for some time and that this requires implementation of prudent \nand appropriate economic policies to maintain macroeconomic stability. An expansionary fiscal \nstance was adopted to counter expected impacts of the crisis (Table 1).  \n \n                                                 \n10  Due to an overexpansion in lending during FY2008 by the major commercial banks, the banking system is now \ngoing through a consolidation phase. Both the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Westpac \nhave made provisions for bad debts amounting to around 20% of their portfolios. By June 2009, both banks had \nrecovered approximately half of the provisions; both have significantly tightened their lending criteria.  \n11  Tonga pegs its exchange rate to a trade-weighted basket of currencies (including the United States, Australian, \nand New Zealand dollars). The exchange rate appreciated 6.0% in real effective terms in 2008. \n12 Commercial banks were responsive to NRBT's request to reduce interest rates further. The weighted average \nlending rate fell by 1.2% in July 2009 (month-on-month basis), and business rates decreased by 2.8%. Housing \nrates, however, increased by 2.2%\u2014reflecting tightened lending conditions in response to the increasing number of \nnonperforming loans. \n13  The government has in principle approved, and is now finalizing, a new national strategic planning framework, \nwhich will assist its efforts in effectively addressing the crisis. In particular, the new framework aims to ensure \nsustained equitable economic growth in Tonga by focusing, among other areas, on private sector growth, \ninfrastructure development and maintenance, community development, and health and education. Smaller and \nmore efficient government, better public enterprise governance and performance, and improved effectiveness of \nrevenue collection and programs are among the enabling themes for the public sector. \n14  Government of Tonga. 2009.

Projected  expenditure  in  the  FY2010  budget  is  13.7%  higher  than  the  FY2009 \nprovisional outturn, which in turn was up 10.3% on FY2008. Expenditure is projected to increase \nacross all key components: wages and salaries (8.3%); capital expenditure, inclusive of off-\nbudget  loan-funded  reconstruction  efforts  (241%);  and  current  expenditure  (20.3%).  The \nGovernment  also  budgeted  T$17.4  million  for  increased  debt  prepayments,  although  this \namount is expected to be significantly less. The Government commits that program funds will \nnot be directed to debt repayment given the expectation that the overall budget balance will be \ngreater than the value of the economic recovery support program grant. Table 1 provides an \noverview of the budget outcomes and official estimates for FY2010, including the financing gap. \nTaking  into  account  the  expectation  of  lower  revenue  and  without  any  compensatory \nexpenditure reductions, the financing gap is T$42.1 million.  \n \n19.  Budgeted capital expenditure does not present the government's full investment plans. \nThe government's own capital expenditure allocation in FY2010 has fallen to T$11.8 million \nfrom an estimated outturn of T$17.4 million in FY2009, however this apparent decline reflects \none-time  property  purchases  that  inflated  capital  spending  in  FY2009  by  approximately \nT$9.7 million.15 The capital spending priorities in the FY2010 budget include office building \nrenovations (T$4.1 million), road maintenance (T$6.7 million), purchase of new plant (T$4.3 \nmillion), and new equipment (T$2.1 million)\u2014some of these are reflected as current expenditure \nin the budget. The reconstruction loan from China Eximbank funds a substantial portion of the \nrebuilding of Nuku'alofa and associated works. However, the \u2018in-kind\u2019 portion of the loan amount \nis not included as a cash appropriation and hence, the total loan amount is not reflected in the \ncash  capital  expenditure  estimate  in  the  government  finance  statistics  presentation  in  the \n                                                 \n15  The government purchased property overseas for diplomatic use.  \n ", "  7\nBudget Statement FY2010 (although a full government finance statistics presentation would \ncapture both cash and in-kind components)16 T$40 million of these loan funds were drawn down \nin April 2009.17 Inclusive of this T$40 million, total capital expenditure amounts to T$51.8 million \nin FY2010 compared with T$17.4 million in FY200918\u2014an increase of 241%. While the full loan \namount will not be expended, a large increase in capital spending is expected. Coupled with \neffective  enforcement  of  high  local  content  in  the  implementation  of  capital  works,  the \ngovernment's capital spending may facilitate employment creation and business activity in some \nsectors. \n \n20.  Other current expenditure increased by 24.6% from FY2009. This is partly attributable to \na significant increase in purchases of goods and services by T$16.2 million (26.3%) reflecting \nexpenditure in support of a European Union-funded agriculture project, road maintenance, and \nother capital investment related items (para. 19). Increases in subsidies and other current \ntransfers  (by  24.2%)  is  a  further  contributory  factor.  The  key  element  of  this  increased \nexpenditure comprises the transfers to nonprofit organizations, largely supporting increased \ncosts of community service obligations, such as shipping, power, and airline services (up 86% in \nFY2009), and scholarships (up 16%). Subsidies to public enterprises (T$2 million) will support \nthe  cost  of  upgrading  street  lighting  and  operating  the  waste  management  authority.  The \nGovernment  expects  that  significant  expenditure  savings  can  be  achieved  from  current \nexpenditure.  \n \n21.  The Government recognizes the need to contain operating expenditure if it is to maintain \nthe provision of basic social services and manage the deficit. During the preparation of the \nFY2010 budget, efforts were made by the Expenditure Review Committee (ERC)19 to subject \nexpenditure proposals from the ministries to closer scrutiny, and to decrease expenditure on \nlower-priority  initiatives.  FY2009  expenditure  allocations  identified  as  low-priority  operating \nexpenditure and subsequently reduced in the FY2010 budget include \n(i)  overseas travel (T$2.07 million cut in budget); \n(ii)  office supplies, printing and stationary, and subscriptions (T$1.16 million cut in \nbudget); \n(iii)  hospitality (T$482,000 cut in budget); and \n(iv)  rental (T$267,000 cut in budget). \n \n22.  Underlying revenue declined by 5.5% in FY2009; the Government forecast it to increase \nby 11.5% in FY2010 given improved compliance and positive government growth forecasts. \nHowever, actual revenue during the third quarter of 2009 was about 21% below the monthly \naverage  for  collections  (Figure  1).  The  revised  government  estimate  suggests  a  26% \ncontraction in revenue in FY2010.20 This is being driven by a significant reduction in trade taxes \n                                                 \n16  In 2007, the government signed a CNY440 million ($61 million) loan agreement with China Eximbank for the \nreconstruction of buildings destroyed by fire in 2006. Approximately 50% of the loan will be used to upgrade \nstreets, water, and sewage, plus the reconstruction of Vuna wharf. The remaining 50% will be onlent to the private \nsector for the reconstruction of buildings destroyed by the fire, with the government guaranteeing the exchange \nrisk. Australia and New Zealand have provided additional reconstruction funds as grants (T$15 million); these are \nbeing onlent to the private sector. \n17  While the overall allocation of the loan is equally split between government and private sector use, the intended \nallocation of this drawdown is not available.  \n18  The China Eximbank loan contributed T$5.0 million to capital expenditure in FY2009. This does not appear in cash \nexpenditure, but is part of the net lending component of the FY2009 outcome. \n19  The ERC is chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the deputy prime minister; the minister of finance and \nnational planning; chairperson of the public service commission. The ERC regularly meets at least on a monthly \nbasis, and as required.   \n20  The IMF 2009 Article IV staff report projected a revenue shortfall of T$20 million.  \n ", "8   \n(forecast to be 73% below budget), reflecting both reduced imports and collection difficulties. \nGrants are also forecast to decline from the T$45.3 million21 budget outcome in FY2009 to \nT$37.9 million in FY2010 (exclusive of the ADB grant). Given the need to revise the revenue \nforecast, unless further expenditure restraint is exercised, the resulting underlying fiscal deficit is \nexpected to reach T$42.1 million (10.3% of GDP). \n \n23.  The Government has a number of options to respond to the budget gap created by the \nlower than expected revenue, and expects to utilize a mix of these options. Some reduction in, \nand reprioritization of, expenditure has been an initial response. The Government, in addition to \nadvising  heads  of  departments  of  the  current  fiscal  position  and  the  need  for  prudent \nmanagement of expenditure, identified T$18 million in potential budget savings in response to \nthe  worsening  fiscal  situation.  Potential  savings  include  (i)  T$4.2  million  in  deferred  debt \nrepayments, (ii) T$4 million budgeted for the Government's contingency fund, (iii) T$2 million \nfrom purchases of goods and services (across all ministries), and (iv) T$500,000 from travel and \ncommunication (across all ministries). Moreover, the Government has given assurances that \npriority areas such as core social expenditure will be protected, capital expenditure maintained \nto the extent possible, and payments to the private sector continued.22 Implementation of the \nexpenditure adjustments will in the first instance reduce the financing gap to T$24.8 million. The \nprogram grant would reduce the gap to T$14.8 million. The Government is currently exploring \nother options to finance the balance, including seeking additional development partner support, \nor through the sale of bonds. The sale of bonds is expected to be largely taken up by the \ncommercial banks, and will not reduce the availability of credit to the private sector given \nongoing consolidation in the banking system, and the resulting decline in private sector credit \ngrowth.   \n \n24.  Pressures on the budget. In 2005, the Government entered into a public sector wage \nagreement in which it committed to implement salary increases for the public sector of between \n60%  and  80%  by  FY2006,  and  to  undertake  regular  salary  reviews.  Following  this,  the \nGovernment implemented a large program of voluntary redundancies, which resulted in an 18% \nreduction in the number of government employees. Nonetheless the wages and salaries bill \n(including redundancy costs) increased to 52% of budget in FY2007 before falling back to 43% \nin FY2009. A 10% salary increase for civil servants is budgeted for FY2010 (3 years after the \nlast salary increase). This is balanced by (i) reducing leave provisions to bring these in line with \nthe  private  sector  and  regional  public  service  comparators  compensation  for  reduced \nallowances for vacation, sick, and casual leave (conversely, maternity leave was increased from \n1 month to 3 months); (ii) strengthening performance evaluation to increase the professionalism \nof the public service; and (iii) eliminating job vacancies, traditionally funded in the budget, and \nreducing  the  number  of  employees.  The  overall  impact  is  a  projected  8.3%  increase  in \nexpenditure for wages in FY2010. The timing of this increase has proved unfortunate. A growing \nwages bill, if positions are increased or as further demands for wage increases arise, is a \npotential source of expenditure pressure on the budget.23 \n                                                 \n21  This is the FY2009 actual amount, which reflects an extraordinary grant from the People's Republic of China of \nT$25 million, which was not included in the FY2009 budget. \n22  The Ministry of Finance established a cash flow management framework that ensures that cash inflows and \noutflows are matched, as well as a minimum cash flow reserve (1 month expenditure). Earlier in FY2010, a tight \ncash flow situation, resulting from lower than forecast revenue collected, meant that payments to suppliers were \nbeing made within a 14-day period rather than upon receipt of invoices. However, the situation has since improved \nand payments are being made earlier. In addition, government ministries have been advised to only place orders \nfor supplies, and other commodities, when cash is available. \n23  The salaries and wage expenditure in the budget consists of several items that are not strictly part of the public \nsector wage bill, such as allowances for legislators, the privy purse, and district and town officers salaries. The \nsalary component of the salary and wages line items in the budget estimates constitutes approximately 77% of the \n ", "  9\n \n25.  Public enterprises have been a significant area of government reform (Appendix 5). \nTypically these create substantial demands on the budgets of Pacific governments in the form of \nsubsidies and credit guarantees. Tonga is notable in that its public enterprise reform program \nhas  resulted  in  clear  identification  of  community  service  obligation  costs  and  a  significant \nreduction in subsidies; in FY2010, these are expected to amount to just T$2 million.  \n \n3.  Complementary Structural and Governance Reforms \n26.  In recent years, the Government has been implementing important structural reform \nmeasures  to  improve  productivity  and  create  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector  in  the \neconomy,  and  thus  boost  the  medium-term  economic  growth  rate.  The  reforms  focus  on \nstrengthened public financial management, public sector reform (through improved public sector \nproductivity and public enterprise rationalization), and an improved operating environment for \nthe private sector. ADB has supported Tonga in this reform process with national and regional \ntechnical  assistance  (TA).24 The  continuation  of  these  reforms  place  Tonga  in  a  stronger \nposition to mitigate the impacts of the crisis and will help the economy reemerge more quickly \nand stronger.  \n \n27.  The 2007 assessment of public financial management used the public expenditure and \nfinancial  accountability  (PEFA)  framework.25 It  identified  that  the  existing  public  financial \nmanagement systems and processes need improvement in terms of effectively formulating, \nimplementing, and monitoring government budgets. Inadequate expenditure management has \ntwo consequences: (i) control of the budget rests on short-term cash availability, rather than \nsystematic cash-flow forecasts, so that budgeted spending often does not occur when it is \nneeded; and (ii) inadequate budget controls prevent accurate spending on budget priorities, \nparticularly  capital  and  social  expenditure.  A  further  consequence  is  that  poor  budgetary \ncontrols increase the difficulty of monitoring critical revenues and expenditures during the crisis \nso that the economy could be thrown off course if unexpected developments occur, either \ninternally or externally.  \n \n28.  While overall fiscal discipline is generally well maintained, issues in the processes of \ndeveloping  and  implementing  budgetary  policy,  expenditure  tracking,  and  the  analytical \nclassifications on which to base fiscal policy are areas of concern.26 In particular, (i) many \nissues have been identified around the methodology and standards used to prepare budgets, \n                                                                                                                                                          \ntotal, including employer contributions. Excluding these and the employer contributions, which is mandated in the \nadministrative regulations to the 1998 Retirement Fund Act, the total wages and salaries component of the FY2010 \nbudget will rise 2.2%. \n24  ADB. 2002.

The Government is committed to addressing these issues, and a number of important \nreform measures are under way or planned in the areas of budgetary management, public \nsector  procurement  practices,  internal  expenditure  controls  to  reflect  the  Public  Financial \nManagement Act, efficiency of the public financial management system, and policy development \nand  implementation.  In  particular,  over  the  past  2  years,  some  of  the  public  financial \nmanagement improvements include (i) existence of and adherence to a fixed budget calendar \nthrough the role played by the ERC in coordinating, allocating, and ensuring compliance with \nthe budget strategy; (ii) preparation of the FY2010 budget using forward estimates as a first step \nto a medium-term budget framework; (iii) up-to-date public accounts (FY2008 accounts were \nsigned  by  the  auditor  general  and  FY2009  accounts  will  be  submitted  to  for  auditing  by \nDecember 2009; (iv) monthly bank reconciliations; (v) regular cash flow management reports \nand advice to management, with the daily cash position being reviewed within line ministries; \n(vi) government financial managers meet on a quarterly basis, (vii) procurement regulation is in \nits final stage for submission to the cabinet's law committee before the end of 2009; (viii) \nstrengthened assets register; (ix) regular reporting on public debt status; and (x) improved \nrecording of development partner assisted projects. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s  2008  private  sector  assessment  for  Tonga  (Appendix  5)  identifies  several \nstructural issues as reform priorities for private sector development, including (i) an oversized \nand unproductive public sector (both public enterprises and the public service), which lowers \noverall productivity in the economy; (ii) an outdated and ineffective commercial legal framework, \nwhich makes establishing, operating, and exiting business difficult and costly; (iii) weaknesses \nin the licensing and regulation of businesses, which raises transactions costs; and (iv) difficulties \nin accessing finance.28 Commercial law reform to strengthen the business environment is well \nadvanced and requires completion. Work to improve access to finance through a reformed \ncollateral  framework  and  enhance  financial  services  is  progressing  but  needs  continued \nattention.  \n \n31.  The  ongoing  public  enterprise  reform  program,  which  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  the \ngovernment's fiscal and structural policy, is progressing well and will provide a substantial boost \nto the long-run growth potential. It could also (i) provide additional revenue from the entities that \nare to be reformed, (ii) make funds available that are currently being used to provide direct \nsupport  for  operations,  and  (iii)  contribute  to  general  economic  growth  by  making  more \nproductive use of the capital stock of these enterprises as management and operating efficiency \nimprove.29 ADB has provided considerable support to this government reform program since \n2002 (footnote 24). \n                                                 \n27  In particular, (i) the public financial management framework does not include an internal audit function; (ii) no \nintegrated payroll system is in place (the Public Service Commission and the Treasury maintain separate payroll \nsystems); (iii) noncompliance with internal controls for general expenditure is widespread within most ministries; \nand (iv) draft procurement legislation and regulations have yet to be enacted, and without these, new procurement \nprocedures are not being implemented effectively. \n28  ADB. 2008.

Special \nEvaluation Study: ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhancing Results through Ownership, \nCapacity, and Continuity. Manila. \n29  Results achieved in the past 2 years include the rationalization of three public enterprises: Leiola Duty Free \n(privatization in 2008), Westpac Bank of Tonga (divestiture of a minority shareholding in 2008), and Tongatapu \nMachinery Pool (liquidation in 2008); a number of ongoing preprivatization restructurings as well as the progressive \nadoption of the 2006 policy to phase out all government ministers and public servants from public enterprise \nboards.  \n ", " 11\n \n32.  The benefits to government of continuing the public enterprise reforms are significant. \nPublic enterprises control 14%\u201322% of total fixed assets within the economy, yet contribute just \nover 6% to GDP (footnote 1). Tonga\u2019s public enterprises currently achieve an overall return on \naverage equity of 3.6%, well below the 10% target return on equity set by the Government. If \nthe total equity now invested in the operating public enterprises (around T$190 million) could \nachieve the target return on equity, and if other measures relevant to the reform of public \nenterprises can be implemented, the benefit through public enterprise reform to the government \ncould be as high as T$17 million per annum, in present value terms (equivalent to over 2% of \nGDP). Further information on public enterprise performance is in Appendix 5. \n \n33.  The  Government  has  also  taken  public  service  reform  measures  to  establish  the \ninstitutional framework for a more  performance-oriented public service. The Public Service \nCommission has launched comprehensive public service remuneration reform commencing in \nFY2010. The main provisions are (i) a significant cut in annual and sick leave provisions (which \nwere among the most generous in the region, if not internationally); (ii) a 10% across-the-board \nsalary and wage increase for all public sector employees (para. 24); (iii) an increase in the \ngovernment employer contribution from 7.5% of salaries and wages to 10%;30 (iv) a biennial \nperformance-based review of public service remuneration; and (v) provision of a fixed salary \nceiling for government departments that cannot be exceeded, and prohibition for the creation of \nnew positions without Public Service Commission approval.   \n \n34.  These civil service reform measures are a continuation of the reforms initiated in 2002, \nwith ADB support, but interrupted by the 2005 strike and 2006 civil disturbances.31  They are \ndesigned to improve the productivity of the public service, make it more professional, and \nensure that dissatisfaction due to erosion of salaries and wages arising from a failure to adjust \nwages and salaries on a regular basis does not lead to a repeat of the damaging strike by civil \nservants (Appendix 5). It will be vital for the Government to ensure that implementation of these \nreform measures is well managed, with a view to rapidly achieving productivity gains and \nbudgetary savings, as staff reductions will materialize over time. The government could also \nconsider reducing wage increases, or spreading the increase over time to reduce pressure on \nthe FY2010 budget.  \n \n4.  Protecting the Vulnerable \n35.  Tonga has long achieved universal primary enrollment; the majority of students continue \nto secondary education. Investment in education has been given a high priority, and accounts \nfor a large share of total recurrent government expenditures. Over the past 3 years, spending \nper student in government middle and secondary schools increased by over 50%. The national \nhealth  system  provides  a  program  of  primary  health  care,  which  promotes  universal \naccessibility,  acceptability,  appropriateness,  and  affordability.  As  a  result,  the  Government \nprovides  most  health  services  free  of  charge  to  Tongan  citizens,  and  nearly  the  entire \npopulation has access to medical services through the national hospital on the main island of \nTongatapu, district hospitals in the three main island groups, and 13 health centers around the \ncountry.  \n \n                                                 \n30  As scheduled in the 1999 Retirement Fund Administration Regulation. \n31  ADB. 2002.

Given this good performance, the goal of social protection policy is to enhance current \nprograms and develop new ones to cushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable \nmembers of Tongan society (Appendix 6). Securing basic health and education, and providing \nopportunities by promoting economic activity across the more remote regions are important \npillars of the strategy. While Tonga has relatively high human development indicator scores, the \nGovernment is committed to improvement.  \n \n37.  Partnerships  with  development  partners  and  innovative  approaches  have  provided \nstrong outcomes in the health and education sectors. These provide a strong foundation for \nprotecting the vulnerable as the impacts of the crisis are felt:  \n(i)  In line with the Eighth Sustainable Development Plan32 the Ministry of Health has \nmade efforts to redirect the health budget to primary and preventative services, \nensuring service provision at rural and regional health centers is protected.33 The \nministry  emphasizes  strengthening  its  performance  management  systems.  It \nprioritizes the development and operation of information systems, and monitors \nthe utilization and quality of the information collected. \n(ii)  The Ministry of Education, with the support of the New Zealand Agency for \nInternational Development and the World Bank, has a school grants program34 \nthat provides grants to all primary schools35 to help them meet minimum service \nstandards by funding teaching materials, repairs and maintenance, and fixed \nassets.  Grants  comprise  base  and  per  pupil  amounts.  Grants  are  allocated \naccording to a formula that reflects school size, location, remoteness, and a \nsocioeconomic  factor  (based  on  household  income  earning  index  from  the \ncensus). This has the effect of channeling more resources to schools in areas \nwhere students tend to come from vulnerable populations.  \n38.  The Government provides free education (to secondary) and basic health services; this \nis an important component of social welfare in Tonga. The Government has been supported by \nhigh development partner support to these sectors. Nonetheless recognized gaps remain, for \nexample, palliative care, services for the disabled (including access to education), and support \nfor the mentally ill, which the Government has been unable to fund. Social protection is largely a \ncommunity responsibility; however, changing demographics and migration are putting pressure \non traditional assistance structures.  \n \n39.  The Government is also developing a community development program to promote \nmore  equal  regional  and  local  economic  and  social  opportunities.  It  aims  to  make  local \ngovernance structures more responsive to the needs of the people. It foresees the devolution of \ndecision-making and responsibilities in local and regional developments, and will focus on \ndeveloping  functional  government  systems  (in  regions,  districts,  towns,  and  villages),  and \nencourage local authorities to develop rural services. \n \n40.  The Government recognizes that securing basic health and education, and providing \nopportunities by promoting economic activity outside urban areas are important pillars of the \nsocial protection strategy.  \n                                                 \n32  Government of Tonga. 2006.

Appendix 7 provides an analysis of the government response to the global economic \ncrisis. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n42.  The program will contribute to achieving higher and more inclusive economic growth in \nTonga. The main outcome will be a timely and effective response to the global economic crisis \nby providing budget support to finance the deficit forecast for the FY2010 budget. This will \nenable the government to implement an appropriate package to promote growth, continue \nstructural reforms to strengthen foundations for growth, and protect the most vulnerable parts of \nsociety from the impact of the economic crisis.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework, Outputs, and Actions \n43.  The  program  outputs  are  (i)  budget  support  to  protect  expenditure  on  basic  social \nservices  for  the  vulnerable,  (ii)  maintenance  of  fiscal  responsibility,  (iii)  structural  and \ngovernance  improvements,  (iv)  support  to  the  vulnerable  through  targeted  actions,  and \n(v) communication  and  ownership  of  economic  and  fiscal  management  initiatives.  The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix are in Appendix 2. \n \n44.  Output 1: Budget support to protect expenditure on basic social services for the \nvulnerable. FY2010 budget revisions forecast a deficit of T$42.1 million (10.3% of GDP), if no \nsteps are taken to contain expenditure. The grant will partially fund this gap, and thus support \nplanned expenditure to address the impacts of the crisis. In determining how best to reduce \nexpenditure, the following principles will guide decisions: \n(i)  expenditure on essential social services (including primary education and basic \nhealth services) will not be cut; and \n(ii)  savings will be made through a planned and strategic reduction in low value-\nadded current expenditure. \n45.  Efforts  to  better  understand  and  track  expenditure  on  basic  social  services  will  be \nsupported by an expenditure tracking system (para. 58) and analysis of this information. A key \nissue in social sector expenditure is achieving an appropriate balance between wage and salary \nexpenditure and nonwage and salary expenditure. The Government intends to ensure nonwage \nand salary expenditure on basic social services is maintained.  \n \n46.  The potential for capital investment to stimulate growth, through short-term job creation \nand in the medium term improving the operating environment for the public and private sector, \ncan  be  realized  once  development  partner  funds  are  channeled  through  the  budget.  The \nongoing efforts of the Ministry of Finance to bring development partner funds on-budget will \nallow  the  Government  a  clearer  understanding  of  its  capital  investment  position.  The \ncommitment to a prioritized medium- to long-term infrastructure investment plan (output 3) will \nreinforce the need for a clear presentation of capital investment through the budget. \n \n ", "14  \n47.  Output 2: Maintenance of fiscal responsibility.36 The 2007 PEFA provided guidance \nfor public financial management reform efforts. In particular, the Government focused on timely \npreparation of public accounts and initiated a move to a medium-term budget framework (para. \n29). On the revenue side, in 2008, Tonga put in place new income tax and customs legislation. \nThe simplified taxation system creates fewer distortions and is simpler to apply.  \n \n48.  As part of the program, the Government will complete a second PEFA in 2010. This will \nrecord progress since the 2007 PEFA and identify priority areas for action. The results of the \nPEFA will be publicly released, and contribute to improved transparency in public financial \nmanagement in Tonga. The Government will also commit to implementing a number of PEFA-\nrelated improvements during the program period, including approval of regulations for public \nprocurement under the Public Financial Management Act, completion of the Treasury instruction \nand Treasury manual, and establishment of an internal audit unit within the Ministry of Finance \nto strengthen financial management.  \n \n49.  The Government sees benefit in more rigorous and transparent use of the concept of \noperating parameters, around measures of capital expenditure and maintenance, government \npersonnel costs, other (nonpersonnel) operating costs, and debt. The intent of such financial \nratios is to promote fiscal sustainability over the medium term. The program provides for an \nERC commitment to develop these as practical management tools for fiscal responsibility. ADB \nwill assist Tonga in developing these ratios through the Pacific Economic Management TA.37 \nThese ratios will then be included in the budget guidelines for FY2011, provided to ministries at \nthe outset of the budget cycle, and used in setting the parameters for the FY2011 budget. The \nFY2011 budget will contain 3-year macroeconomic and revenue forecasts to better support a \nmedium-term budget perspective.  \n \n50.  The program will contribute to the strengthening of the budget process through the \ncreation  of  a  macroeconomic  technical  committee  reflecting  senior  membership  from  key \neconomic agencies in Government (Ministry of Finance, NRBT, Department of Statistics, and \nthe Prime Minister's Office). This committee will meet regularly, at least quarterly, and work to \nimprove the quality of economic forecasts and macroeconomic analysis being supplied to the \nERC (through the minister of finance) and hence used in the budget development process. This \nprocess of quality assurance will encompass the model being used, the assumptions made \nregarding likely scenarios, and a shared understanding of the purpose and use of the forecasts. \nThe creation of a committee with formalized terms of reference and meeting process also \nprovides for greater accountability for decision making. Increasing the number of stakeholders \ninvolved  in  the  development  of  forecasts  is  expected  to  more  effectively  utilize  strengths \navailable  within  various  agencies,  recognizing  the  human  resource  capacity  constraints \ngenerally  faced  in  Tonga.  While  the  committee's  initial  focus  will  be  improved  rigor  of \nforecasting,  the  membership  of  the  committee  provides  more  generally  for  strengthened \neconomic policy analysis and advice to the ERC through the minister of finance, and hence \nused in the budget development process. The minister of finance recognizes this as a useful \nrole.  \n \n51.  Related support is already being provided through TA (footnote 37) to strengthen ERC \noperations by clarifying its mandate and criteria for considering expenditure decisions. This is \n                                                 \n36  The  public  financial  management-related  reform  measures  are  harmonized  with  the  public  sector  reform \ncomponent  of  the  Tonga\u2013Australia  Partnership  for  Development.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment is providing implementation support to several of these measures.  \n37  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management. Manila (TA 7280-REG, subprogram 1). \n ", " 15\nexpected to create an environment in which the ERC will seek specific macroeconomic policy \nanalysis and recommendations, and the macroeconomic technical committee will be well placed \nto respond. The TA will also enable mentoring of the macroeconomic technical committee as it \ntakes on these new roles and responsibilities. \n \n52.  The  program  will  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  debt  risk \nmanagement and mitigation policy and strategy. The intent is to help the government move to \nmore sustainable debt and to ensure that financial risks are prudent. The policy and strategy \ncan also be potentially used to facilitate dialogue on the use and scope of debt management \ntools and their capacity for integration with other financial planning and management tools. The \npolicy and strategy will be inclusive of \n(i)  processes by which guarantees and debt are analyzed before being agreed to;  \n(ii)  processes and responsibilities for approval of new debt; \n(iii)  consideration of interest rate and foreign currency risks of existing and proposed \nnew debt; \n(iv)  clear presentation of debt and planned debt payments in the annual budget; \n(v)  strengthened  coordination  between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National \nPlanning and other stakeholders in the issue of public debt;  \n(vi)  debt repayment priorities;  \n(vii)  processes for scheduling debt repayment;  \n(viii)  a  schedule  of  timely  and  standardized  reporting  on  the  government\u2019s  debt \nportfolio; and \n(ix)  regular updating of the debt strategy for fiscal results and its alignment with the \nfiscal and macroeconomic forecasts in the budget.  \n \n53.  Output 3: Structural and governance improvements. This component of the program \nwill ensure the continuation of the government's planned and ongoing structural reforms, which \nare geared to improving the productivity of the economy and placing it on a sustainable, private \nsector-led growth path over the medium term. Initiatives under way focus on accelerating public \nenterprise reform to reduce fiscal constraints and improve the productivity of public enterprises, \nas well as to modernize the commercial legal framework. \n \n54.  The public enterprise reform actions seek to improve efficiency and reduce the drain on \nthe budget and the economy. It will also seek to achieve some \"quick wins\" in terms of boosting \neconomic growth in the short to medium term. This will be achieved by (i) strengthening public \nenterprise governance through the appointment of an increasing number of directors selected \nfrom a pool of trained private sector professionals, and an amendment to the Public Enterprise \nAct, which will enhance the commercial governance practices of the public enterprises, as well \nas  strengthen  the  monitoring  framework;  and  (ii)  enhancing  the  performance  of  public \nenterprises through a rationalization process and the promotion of private sector participation. \n \n55.  The program will help strengthen the laws and regulations under which businesses in \nTonga operate, so reducing the cost of doing business and improving access to finance. The \nmain target reforms are (i) amendment of the Companies Act, 1995, making it more suitable for \ncompanies that do business in Tonga;38 (ii) establishment of a new companies registry, which \n                                                 \n38  The Companies Amendment Act was passed in September 2009. \n ", "16  \nwill replace the paper registry destroyed by fire during the civil disturbances in 2006 (combined \nwith  the  amendment  to  the  Companies  Act,  1995,  it  will  make  the  process  of  company \nregistration simple and fast); and (iii) Companies Act regulations. The program will help improve \naccess to finance by reducing the risks of both lending and borrowing. These reforms will be put \nin place through a new personal property securities act, which will facilitate the use of chattels \nas collateral for loans. \n \n56.  The  Government  will  finalize  and  implement  a  medium-  to  long-term  prioritized \ninfrastructure investment plan, and, through this, seek to identify and promote opportunities for \npublic\u2013private partnerships. Such a plan will promote greater development partner alignment \nwith country needs and improved coordination and sequencing of public investments. It will also \nsupport a clearer budgetary presentation of the government's capital investment expenditure.  \n \n57.  Output 4: Support the vulnerable through targeted actions. The Government is \nalready directing considerable financial resources to the social sector, which provides services \nused  by  the  vulnerable  (and  this  expenditure  is  protected  under  output  1).  However,  the \nGovernment recognizes that areas for improvement remain in the priority setting, targeting, and \ndelivery of such services to ensure the needs of the vulnerable are met. There are some initial \nsteps that Government is taking in this area.  \n \n58.  The  Government  will  commission  an  expenditure  tracking  system  for  health  and \neducation. This will provide the information for improved decision making regarding targeted \nexpenditure. In parallel, the Ministry of Health will undertake and commence implementation of \na targeted review of existing facilities and equipment to ensure that these support the provision \nof services in the outer islands and districts and community health centers. This supports its \ngoal of providing appropriate services to all the outer island districts and community health \ncenters through effective resourcing, particularly important given that almost two-thirds of the \npopulation lives outside urban areas.  \n \n59.  In continuing to address the specific needs of vulnerable populations, the Government \nwill adopt and put in place the delivery structures for a new community development program, \nthe goal of which is to reduce hardship and poverty by strengthening communities, civil society \ngroups and organizations, and government to work in partnership to identify, prioritize, and \naddress their own development needs. The program will support the participatory development \nof village, town and district 3-year rolling development plans utilizing democratic tools such as \nmatrices  and  ballots,  and  empower  district  and  town  officers  to  implement  the  prioritized \nactivities.  \n \n60.  The community development program being implemented is a form of community-driven \ndevelopment (CDD) as it gives control of decisions and resources to community groups. CDD \ntreats vulnerable people as assets and partners in the development process, building on their \ninstitutions  and  resources.  Experience  demonstrates  that  by  directly  relying  on  vulnerable \npeople to drive development activities, CDD has the potential to make poverty reduction efforts \nmore responsive to demands, more inclusive, more sustainable, and more cost-effective than \ntraditional centrally led programs. Support to CDD usually includes strengthening and financing \ninclusive community groups, facilitating community access to information, and promoting an \nenabling environment through policy and institutional reform. These are elements of the Tongan \ncommunity development program design.  \n \n61.  The CDD program intends to support community residents in analyzing their situation \nand setting their priorities, developing their project management capacity, and developing some \n ", " 17\nskills in monitoring and evaluating their development programs. Program design was informed \nby a set of guiding principles inclusive of (i) poverty and hardship focus; (ii) self-reliance and \nownership; (iii) participation; and (iv) women, youth, the poorest households, and remotest \ncommunities. Priorities for the scheme are income-generating activities and youth activities, \nthough the scope of activities eligible for funding includes community development, women, \nhealth, and education activities. Funding for activities will be provided through the community \ndevelopment committee. \n \n62.  The expenditure tracking and CDD program are likely to provide information useful to \nstrengthen policy formulation. However, these actions are first steps and no readily available \ninformation identifies vulnerable groups within the population, nor provides an understanding of \nhow well traditional social safety nets are responding to, and withstanding, demographic and \neconomic changes within Tongan society. The result is that social policy is not based on a \nrigorous analysis of the current situation. The program will support the development of an issues \npaper on vulnerable persons for the Cabinet's consideration. The cabinet paper will include \nidentification of vulnerable groups, adequacy of existing social safety net systems, and options \nfor enhanced social protection policies. In this respect, the program has markedly raised the \nprofile of social protection and social welfare as concerns of the government.  \n \n63.  Output 5: Communication and ownership. Lessons from ADB experience point to the \nimportance  of  communication,  consultation  and  ownership  in  economic  reform.  The \ndevelopment of local awareness, understanding, and ownership of programs are important \nsuccess factors. The Government, through the Ministry for Finance and Planning, will therefore \ndevelop and deliver a communications strategy that will describe the government\u2019s response to \nthe global economic crisis. This will form the basis for consultation with stakeholders on these \nissues,  and  in  the  medium  term  will  provide  a  model  for  seeking  feedback  to  the  policy \nformulation process. \n \n64.  The program supports the public release of external and independent reports on the \nTongan economy and public financial management issues, in particular, the 2009 IMF Article IV \nstaff  report  and  the  second  PEFA.  The  Government  has  committed  to  publishing  public \nenterprise performance data for FY2009. Such public release of information enables informed \nstakeholder dialogue on key economic issues.  \n \nC.  Lessons \n65.  The design of the program incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in policy-based \nlending in the Pacific and elsewhere (Table 2).39  \n \nD.  Important Features \n66.  Rapid response to global economic crisis. The program provides quick-disbursing \nbudget support to allow the Government to effectively respond to the economic, fiscal, and \nsocial  impacts  of  the  crisis.  The  Government  is  increasing  revenue  efforts  and  reviewing \nexpenditure to identify potential budget savings.  \n                                                 \n39  Key sources of lessons are: ADB. 2009.

Structural reform. The program will leverage continuation of public sector and private \nsector development reform at a time when priority accorded to such reforms could be reduced. \n ", " 19\nThe reforms are underpinned by significant analytical work and ongoing technical engagement \nand dialogue, especially in the areas of fiscal policy and infrastructure, and structural reform. \nThese are based on the existing partnership between Tonga and ADB in these areas. It links \ninto partnerships with other development agencies, in particular with the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development and the New Zealand Agency for International Development in public \nsector  reform  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  in  private  sector  development \n(Appendix 8). The program builds on government reforms and reinforces ADB's role as a major \npartner in responding to Tonga\u2019s development needs, including rapid crisis response, and in \nsupporting economic and social development and reform. For its part, the Government has \ncommitted to a prudent response to the crisis, while leveraging the program as an opportunity to \nimplement reform to transform the growth path of Tonga's economy in the longer term. Toward \nthis end, the program provides the necessary fiscal resources, focus, and discipline for the \ncontinued implementation of important reform measures.  \n \n68.  Leveraging  social  protection  initiatives.  The  program  provides  an  anchor  for  a \nproposed regional project, for financing by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, designed to \nstrengthen the resilience of the vulnerable through social impact analysis; identification and \nassessment of targeted rapid response measures such as cash for work and cash transfer \nprograms;  piloting  of  targeted  social  protection  programs;  support  for  nongovernment \norganizations\u2019 activities to protect the vulnerable; and monitoring and evaluation of the impact of \nsuch activities (para. 87).  \n \n69.  Postprogram  monitoring  framework. The program contains reform measures, the \nimplementation of which will mostly require at least a medium-term horizon to fully achieve the \nintended outcomes. The Government and ADB have, therefore, agreed on the medium-term \nprogram directions set out in the policy matrix and their linkages to the National Strategic \nPlanning  Framework  (Appendix  2).  These  will  form  the  basis  for  the  development  of  a \npostprogram  monitoring  framework  to  maintain  reform  momentum  and  focus  dialogue  and \nreform commitment through the medium term. The process will be supported by ongoing and \nforthcoming ADB TA (paras. 83\u201387).   \n \n70.  Aid coordination. The formulation and delivery of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nand the program in general, and the crisis response in particular, has been coordinated and \naligned  with  other  development  partners.  Other  development  partners  involved  by  the \nGovernment in the crisis response include Australia in the areas of infrastructure development \nand public sector reform; New Zealand in social sectors and planned business development \nservices;  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the  European  Commission  in \ninfrastructure development; the World Bank in transport; the International Finance Corporation \nin private sector development; and IMF through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCenter  in  economic  statistics  and  surveillance.  In  terms  of  the  proposed  program,  close \ncoordination has been undertaken especially in the areas of public financial management with \nAustralia  (which  features  high  in  the  Tonga\u2013Australia  Partnership  for  Development \nAgreement);40 and the IMF and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center in the course \nof the Article IV surveillance mission and analytical work on economic and fiscal policies. A \ndevelopment coordination matrix is in Appendix 8.  \n \n                                                 \n40  In particular, the program's policy matrix in the area of public financial management is aligned with the Tonga\u2013\nAustralia Partnership for Development, which will facilitate coordinated or joint dialogue and monitoring in this area. \n ", "20  \nE.  Financing Plan \n71.  The Government has requested a grant of $10 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  to  support  its  response  to  the  crisis.  In  determining  the  grant  size, \nconsideration included the following: (i) the crisis has already caused a substantial deterioration \nof the fiscal situation in Tonga, while requiring policy measures to improve productivity, and \nprotect  the  vulnerable;  (ii)  the  global  nature  of  the  crisis  implies  downside  risks  to  the \nsocioeconomic situation in Tonga that, in turn, require preventive policy measures; (iii) the \nGovernment's commitment to a significant economic and public sector reform agenda is high \nand  represents  an  opportunity  for  change;  and  (iv)  the  implementation  of  these  reform \nmeasures will have structural adjustment cost implications. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.   Program Management \n \n72.  The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is the executing agency and will assume overall \nresponsibility for program implementation, including coordination of the policy reform measures \nundertaken under the program. The PMO will ensure that the policy reforms, as agreed to by \nADB and the Government and as described in the development policy letter, are duly carried out \nin a timely manner. Program coordination will be the responsibility of the chief secretary and \nsecretary to cabinet under the PMO, supported by the PMO\u2019s Advisory Unit. The chief secretary \nand secretary to cabinet will (a) ensure close coordination with other relevant ministries and \ngovernment  agencies;  (b)  take  into  account  and  address  capacity  issues  in  implementing \nministries as they occur, to ensure the timely implementation of the program;, and (c) engage \nother stakeholders and raise awareness in the wider public domain on matters related to the \nProgram.  \n \n73.  The Ministry of Finance and National Planning; the Ministry of Public Enterprises; the \nMinistry  of  Labor,  Commerce  and  Industry;  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  will  be  the  main \nimplementing agencies. The ERC, chaired by the Prime Minister, will function as the steering \ncommittee for the program, providing guidance for program implementation and coordination, \nand will meet on monthly basis to discuss the progress of the Program. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n74.  Reforms supported under the program commenced in July 2008 and are expected to be \ncompleted  by  November  2010.  The  program  will  be  completed  18  months  after  grant \neffectiveness, taking into account the audit and reporting requirements. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n75.  Grant proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member countries, other \nthan the items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n76.  The proceeds of the program grant will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans \nand  grants.  Grant  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the \n ", " 21\nGovernment  stipulating  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB's \nprojected disbursements under the grant for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit \nthe use of grant proceeds to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n77.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  executing  agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant agreement. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the program.  \n \n6.  Fiduciary Assessment \n \n78.  To address the perception of lack of transparency and accountability, the Government \nlaunched  a  series  of  reform  measures,  including  introduction  of  the  Public  Financial \nManagement Act, 2002 and associated reforms, establishment of an ombudsman and the Anti-\nCorruption Commission, and customs reform. Public procurement regulations are expected to \nbe considered by the cabinet in December 2009. The program addresses anticorruption from \nseveral  angles.  The  program  strengthens  overall  public  financial  management.  It  includes \nmeasures  to  (i)  improve  procurement  procedures,  (ii)  strengthen  the  quality  of  revenue \ninformation  upon  which  expenditure  decisions  are  based,  and  (iii)  introduce  medium-term \nmacroeconomic forecasts within the budget. It draws heavily on the 2007 PEFA, and will include \na PEFA update. This update will guide further development partner support. Moreover, the \nrationalization process of public enterprises, as supported under the program, including the \nremoval of public servants and politicians as directors from public enterprise boards, is expected \nto reduce the exposure to vested government interests. The reform of the companies law and \nthe new personal property securities framework will help strengthen governance as well.  \n \n7.  Tranching and Counterpart Funds \n \n79.  The grant will be released in two tranches. The condition for effectiveness is that all first \ntranche conditions will have been met to the satisfaction of ADB. The first tranche ($5 million) \nwill be released upon grant effectiveness. The second tranche ($5 million) will be released as \nsoon as ADB is satisfied that the Government has made sufficient progress in implementing the \nprogram, particularly that all the second tranche conditions indicated in the policy matrix have \nbeen met. The indicative timing for release of the second tranche is November 2010. Therefore, \nthe grant proceeds are expected to be fully utilized by December 2010. \n \n80.  The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the grant will be \nused to support implementation of structural and public financial management reform measures, \nand protection of core social expenditure. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n81.  The Government will submit to ADB (i) semiannual reports on program implementation \nand accomplishments of the measures set forth in the development policy letter and the policy \n ", "22  \nmatrix, which will describe progress made, any problems encountered, and remedial actions \ntaken; and (ii) a program completion report within 3 months of program completion.  \n \n9.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n82.  The Government and ADB will monitor progress of program implementation closely. \nReview missions will be undertaken prior to the second tranche release to assess status and \nprogress in accomplishing second tranche release milestones. Regular review missions during \nprogram implementation and thereafter until program completion will be undertaken with a view \nto  measure  progress  against  short-  and  medium-term  targets.  Associated  TA  reviews  will \ncontinue monitoring beyond the lifetime of the program, ensuring the maintenance of the reform \nmomentum.  The  Government,  through  the  PMO,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  program \nperformance monitoring system that will include a database on the status of policy measures \nand program indicators based on the policy matrix and the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n10.  Technical Assistance \n \n83.  ADB has been providing substantial TA support to the Government in areas covered by \nthe program, and will continue to do so during its implementation. The program, therefore, \nreflects continuity in ADB support for government reform priorities by addressing unfinished \nstructural,  public  sector,  and  financial  management  reform.  The  ADB\u2013World  Bank  Tonga \ncountry focal officer (funded by ADB under a regional TA),41 joint ADB\u2013World Bank Country \nFocal Office, will provide an immediate point of contact as well as have relevant expertise to \nprovide technical support as required. \n \n84.  In particular, under the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative,42 ADB is supporting \nthe PMO in the coordination of reforms related to private sector development and analysis of \nrelated issues and projects. The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative is also supporting \nthe contracting out of Ministry of Works\u2019 road maintenance activities; reform of the Companies \nAct, 1995; and public enterprise director training and regional public enterprise benchmarking. \nUnder  TA  for  Reforming  Public  Enterprises,  ADB  is  providing  continued  support  for  the \nrationalization of the public enterprise portfolio.43  \n \n85.  Under the regional TA for Pacific Economic Management (footnote 37), ADB will provide \nmonitoring and advisory support in relation to the crisis. The TA supports the strengthening of \neconomic monitoring systems and using this information to provide higher-quality economic \nadvice. The TA is focused on assisting in the formulation and implementation of country-specific \nactions in response to the global economic crisis. As required, assistance will be provided \nthrough this TA to support development of financial ratios and assessment of the impact of the \nglobal financial crisis on vulnerable groups.  \n \n86.  A  proposed  2009  TA  for  Tonga  will  provide  support  for  economic  and  strategic \nmanagement, in particular, help develop an economic and revenue forecasting model, address \nweaknesses in public expenditure management, and operationalize the new National Strategic \nPlanning Framework into ministry and department corporate plans.  \n \n                                                 \n41 ADB. 2009.

A  linked  regional  project\u2014Supporting  and  Building  Resilience  of  the  Vulnerable\u2014is \nproposed  for  grant  financing  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  It  has  the  key \nobjective of supporting the Government in assessing the social impact of the economic crisis, \nstrengthening social protection policies, piloting social protection measures with potential for \nscaling up, and enhancing the capacity of nongovernment organizations in relation to social \nprotection. As proposed, the linked project will provide Tonga with access to a selection of \nassistance including (i) a short-term response to the vulnerable (including unemployed youth, \nwomen, low-income households, and people with disabilities) to increase their economic status \nthrough  cash-for-work  and  cash  transfer  programs;  (ii)  a  pilot  social  welfare  and  social \nprotection program, along with assessments of target groups and the feasibility of program \ntypes, and policy recommendations as long-term measures to strengthen the social safety net; \n(iii) support for nongovernment organizations and civil society activities for the vulnerable; and \n(iv) socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation of the situation of the vulnerable. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n88.  Economic.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  to  enable  the  Government  to \nrespond to the economic downturn caused by the global economic crisis by stimulating the \neconomy  and  maintaining  essential  services  to  the  vulnerable  population.  In  this  way  the \nprogram will support the recovery of the economy and contribute to the transition to higher and \nmore inclusive economic growth. The decline of remittances, taxes, and duties as a result of the \ncrisis has compressed the fiscal resources available to the Government so that without budget \nsupport, the Government would be unable to adequately respond to the crisis. \n \n89.  The Government wishes to undertake important reform measures in relation to fiscal and \nstructural policies. The program will help address the prime causes of low productivity within the \nTongan economy: the crowding out of private sector activity by public enterprises, the low rate \nof return on assets controlled by public enterprises, and the challenging business environment \nfaced by the private sector. Reforms in public enterprises will deliver the higher-quality and \nlower-cost services needed for economic growth, and provide opportunities for local businesses \nto participate in service delivery. A number of the proposed reform measures will be important \nmilestones in the ongoing public service reform process.  \n \n90.  Social. The program will provide the necessary resources to maintain essential social \nexpenditure,  which  would  otherwise  be  vulnerable  to  reduction  as  a  result  of  budgetary \npressures. The program will also provide the necessary resources for the Government to deliver \nprojects and programs targeting rural communities. An analysis of vulnerability issues is in \nAppendix 6. Government's proposed capital investments, will, to the extent possible, seek to \nmaximize  local  labor  content  to  create  employment  opportunities.  Women  will  particularly \nbenefit from the program, given their vulnerability to the economic crisis; they will benefit from \nprotected social government expenditure, and community development programs that will help \nboost youth and female employment.  \n \n91.  The legal reform components of the structural reform package should improve women\u2019s \naccess to commercial activities by simplifying procedures for women\u2019s groups to incorporate \ncompanies, and allowing women to incorporate companies more quickly and inexpensively. In \naddition, the proposed secured transactions bill will provide women with greater opportunity to \nborrow against a range of personal assets which, currently, is either not possible legally or is \nprohibitive because of the transaction costs.  \n ", "24  \n92.  The program will help the Government develop its understanding of vulnerable groups \nwithin the population and the effectiveness of existing social safety net systems. This will \nprepare for consideration of a greater role for government in providing targeted social welfare \nassistance. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n93.  Financial. The program will encourage improved fiscal management and budgeting \nfocus on priority expenditures. A progressive increase in user charges for infrastructure services \nand preventative maintenance will remove unnecessary costs from the government budget. \nImproved returns from public enterprise assets will give more space in the budget for the \ngovernment\u2019s social and development spending.  \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n94.  The program is built around the government's commitment to address the crisis through \nexerting budgetary prudence, maintaining essential social expenditure, and continuing with its \nfar-reaching structural reform program. The main risks relate to ownership, continued political \nsupport, and capacity. \n \n95.  Ownership. Lack of program ownership within the Government, the bureaucracy, or the \ncommunity may reduce internal pressures to promote program implementation, or may even \nwork actively against its implementation. This risk is mitigated by the fact that the elements of \nthe program are not new issues for the Government. Indeed the program policy actions are \naligned  to  current  government  policy,  and  build  upon  and  extend  more  than  5  years  of \nengagement by ADB with the Government in support of reforms in economic, fiscal, and public \nsector  management.  As  a  result, the  Government  has  strong  champions  for  the  program, \nparticularly the minister of finance, who is also the minister of public enterprises. Close dialogue \nwith both politicians and officials during preparation has tested and confirms ownership. The \ninclusion of a communications strategy within the program seeks to ensure the community is \naware of the program and has sufficient information to understand its intended benefits.  \n \n96.  The  design  of  the  program  itself  also  acts  to  promote  ownership.  It  meets  clearly \nrecognized public financial management needs and so promotes support from the bureaucracy. \nThe design also aims to balance the costs with the benefits. In this regard, the output class on \nsupport to the vulnerable through targeted actions has both direct benefits to the vulnerable \nthemselves, as well as political benefits from the public support generated. This balance works \nto generate wider public support for reform.  \n \n97.  Political risk. As a result of ongoing political reforms, general elections scheduled for \nlate 2010 are likely to lead to changes in the political landscape, which could potentially affect \nGovernment support for the program.44 The ongoing reform process, which continuously fuels \nthe momentum for change in general, and includes a wide range of stakeholders, is partly \naddressing the risks of shifts in political attitudes and commitment. At the same time, the intent \nis that the program will be implemented by the time of the general elections, allowing the flow of \nexpected benefits to act to reduce the risk of any program components being back. \n \n                                                 \n44  The Constitutional and Electoral Commission, formed after the coronation of the current King in August 2008, \ndelivered its report on political reforms on 5 November 2009. The intention is that the general election scheduled \nfor late 2010 will be conducted under a new system. This is expected to see a majority of members of Parliament \nelected by popular vote, the practical implication for the program may be a period of uncertainty with perhaps many \ninexperienced ministers. \n ", " 25\n98.  Political commitment to private and public sector reform is high in Tonga. To date, the \nGovernment  has  demonstrated  its  strong  determination  to  reform,  through  the  outcomes \nachieved in the course of the public enterprise reform program. It has approved and launched \nseveral other private sector development reforms in the program output areas. Commitment will \nbe  maintained  during  the  reform  period.  Progress  in  implementing  reforms  and  achieving \nresults,  continued  engagement,  policy  dialogue,  and  progressively  more  broad-based \nconsultation and participation in the reform process will contribute to the momentum. \n \n99.  Capacity. A risk is that the Government may not have sufficient capacity to implement \nthe program and absorb the substantial reform agenda. To reduce the risk posed by insufficient \ncapacity, TA support to various program components is to be provided (paras. 83\u201387). Through \nits headquarters and field-based personnel (including in Tonga itself), ADB is well placed to \nengage in dialogue at the political level and to provide mentoring and capacity development \nassistance  to  officials.  While  political  and  institutional  commitment  support  continuing  the \nimplementation of reforms, technical and especially managerial resources are in short supply. \nGovernment agencies have demonstrated sufficient absorptive capacity especially in structural \nreform, as demonstrated by recent progress. ADB developed the program in close coordination \nwith  other  development  partners  to  ensure  that  complementary  support  is  provided.  In \nparticular,  the  program  is  harmonized  with  the  activities  of  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  in  public  financial  management  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation in the area of structural reform. \n \n100.  The program also relies on a positive response by the private sector to the structural \nreforms and improved global economic conditions. The capacity of the private sector to respond \nto opportunities presented through government expenditure, and governance and legislative \nchanges  to  the  operating  environment  are  important  to  program  success.  Private  sector \nresponse to the reconstruction measures has increased considerably since early 2009.  \n \n101.  The program relies on (i) a positive response by the private sector to improved economic \nconditions; (ii) government agencies\u2019 commitment to improved performance; and (iii) restraint by \ngovernment agencies in increasing current expenditure, given their weak revenue performance. \n \n102.  Overall, the potential benefits from reducing the impact of the global economic crisis and \nproviding  for  continued  government  expenditure  on  priority  capital  works  and  basic  social \nservices with supporting structural and governance initiatives are considered to outweigh the \nrisks. Indeed, the costs of no action could be substantial. They would be reflected in a rapid \ndecline  in  provision  of  government  services  with  resulting  negative  effects  on  health  and \neducation, and constraints on the private sector. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \nA.  Assurances \n103.  In addition to the standard assurances and the policy conditions set forth in the policy \nmatrix, the Government has given the following specific assurances: \n(i)  The Government will (a) ensure that the policies already adopted and actions \nalready taken as described in the development policy letter, including the policy \nmatrix,  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program  period  and \nsubsequently; and (b) promptly adopt all other policies and take all other actions \nindicated in the development policy letter, including the policy matrix, and ensure \nthat such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the program \nperiod and subsequently. \n ", "26  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral aid partners that have implications for implementation of \nthe  program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals. The Government will continue policy dialogue with ADB on problems \nand  constraints  encountered  during  implementation  of  the  program  and  on \ndesirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n(iii)  Throughout the implementation of the program, the Government will ensure that \nadequate resources are allocated and released in a timely manner in order to \nensure proper implementation of the program as described in the development \npolicy letter. The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds generated \nout of the grant proceeds are directed to fiscal, structural, and social protection \npolicy measures as described in the development policy letter. \n(iv)  The Government will undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free environment; ensure that its anticorruption law and regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced \nand complied with during the program implementation; and facilitate ADB to \nexercise its right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that (a) within 3 months of loan effectiveness, a \nperformance  evaluation  system  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  established  and \nmaintained that will include a database on the status of policy measures and \nProgram indicators based on the policy matrix and the design and monitoring \nframework. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  (i) semiannual  reports  on  program \nimplementation  and  accomplishments  of  the  measures  set  forth  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix, which will describe progress \nmade, any problems encountered, and remedial actions taken; and (ii) a program \ncompletion report within 3 months of program completion. . \n \nB.  Condition for Effectiveness \n104.  Prior to the effectiveness of the Grant Agreement the Government will have complied \nwith all the first trance conditions set out in the Policy Matrix. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n105.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $10,000,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  Economic  Support  Program  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \nC.

Economic Performance \n1.  Tonga is a small open economy vulnerable to internal and external shocks. Real gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth averaged 1.8% per annum since 1999, well below the regional \naverage of 3.2% (Figure A3.1). Economic activity has exhibited significant fluctuations in recent \nyears  as  underlying  structural  constraints,  political  disturbances,  and  global  economic \ndevelopments have adversely affected growth. Following the civil service strike in 2005 and the \ncivil disturbances at the end of 2006, the economy recovered strongly in FY2008 growing by \n2.7% in real terms, the highest growth rate registered since FY2002.1 \n \nFigure A3.1: Economic Indicators\nTonga real GDP growth, FY1995-FY2009\n6\nReal GDP Real GDP per capita\nm 3\nu\nn\nn\na\ner \np\n%  0\n-3\n1994-95 1996\u201397 1998\u201399   2000\u201301 2002-03 2004-05 2006-07 2008-09\nMerchandise imports\n120\nn 80\no\nmili\n$ \nS\nU 40\n0\n7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nF F F F F F F F F F F F\nSource: Government of Tonga.  \n \n \n2.  However, just as the long-term growth outlook for Tonga's economy began to improve, \nthe economy was adversely affected by the sharp increase in the price of fuel and food in the \nsecond half of 2008 (Figure A3.1). The impact of the global economic crisis, which began to \nunfold  at  the  end  of  2008,  further  weakened  economic  activity.  Exports  and  remittances \n                                                 \n1\n  The quality of Tonga\u2019s national accounts statistics is mixed. However, recent revisions to the national accounts, \nwith assistance from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, indicate that both nominal and real GDP is \nsubstantially higher than previously estimated. Nominal GDP has been systematically underestimated in the \nnational accounts by an average of 20% during FY1994\u2013FY2008, and real GDP by an average of 21.2%.  \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \ndeclined because of weak demand and high unemployment in  major source economies\u2014\nAustralia, New Zealand, and the United States. Real GDP growth in FY2009 fell sharply to an \nestimated  0.4%.  The  forecast  is  for  low  growth  in  FY2010.  This  recent  weakening  in  the \neconomy is against a background of a long-term deterioration in economic performance. As \nhighlighted  in  Figure  A3.2,  since  the  mid-1990s  the  investment  ratio  has  remained  at \napproximately 20%. The savings ratio\u2014which indicates the percentage of household disposable \nincome that is saved\u2014shows a more mixed performance, averaging 15% from FY1994 to \nFY2008. Productivity has also declined. Average labor productivity is now only slightly above \nwhat it was in the mid-1980s. Such developments point to deep weaknesses in the growth \nprocess.  \n \nFigure A3.2: Investment and Savings Trends\nSavings ratio Investment ratio\n40\nP 30\nD\nG\n20\nf \no\n%  10\n0\n4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nF F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\nSource: Government of Tonga.\n \n \nB.  Economic Prospects \n3.  Like most small open economies, Tonga is relatively undiversified. It is highly dependent \non remittances and imports a substantial proportion of what it consumes. While agriculture and \nfisheries are still the largest contributors to overall output (averaging 20% of GDP over the last \n5 years), their importance is diminishing as the services sector\u2014led by communications and \ntourism\u2014has grown sharply over the past 15 years. \n \n4.  The Strategic Development Plan Eight,2 covering FY2007\u2013FY2009, established a target \nGDP growth of 5% per year or better, while the Government\u2019s Economic and Public Sector \nReform Program3 instituted in 2002, targeted growth rates of 3% per year or better. Hence, \ngrowth has been below target. Growth was expected to slow in FY2006, but the extent of the \nslowdown exceeded expectations. Growth fell to 0.3% in FY2006 and the economy contracted \nby 1.7% in FY2007. Because the size of the population remains relatively unchanged, the \nchange in GDP per capita closely matches changes in aggregate GDP. \n \n5.  Agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing  account  for  a  quarter  of  GDP  and  industry \ndevelopments have an important bearing on the growth outcome. Strong growth in fish and \nsquash exports, which account for around 80% of merchandise exports, led to good growth in \n                                                 \n1  Government of Tonga. 2006.

However, the combined effect of a fall in \nexport prices, rising costs, and unfavorable weather patterns (for fishing) have seen industry \noutput subsequently contract. Export volumes of both commodities have fallen by about one-\nthird. \n \n6.  Commerce,  restaurants,  and  hotels  experienced  good  growth  to  FY2005,  although \nperformance has been mixed since then (contracting by an average of 5.5% per year) as key \ndrivers of growth\u2014remittances, bank lending, and visitor expenditure\u2014have eased. \n \n7.  Since 2000, tourism has been one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the economy, \nalthough it still accounts for less than 10% of GDP. The increase in the number of overseas \nflights (including those directly from Sydney, Australia), the development of an experienced \ndomestic  airline  in  2007,  and  the  inclusion  of  Tonga  in  the  itinerary  of  cruise  liners  has \nsubstantially boosted visitor numbers and spending in recent years (although the spending per \ncruise ship tourist is lower than that for arrivals by air). Tourism arrivals by air rose nearly 22% \nin FY2008 and cruise ship visitors by 50%. Overall, tourism expenditure rose by nearly 60% \nover the same period. However, at the end of July 2009, tourist arrivals fell by 2.0% on a year-\non-year basis and tourism spending contracted by 13.5%. \n \nC.  Policy Priorities \n8.  For many years, Tonga followed an inward-looking approach to economic management. \nThe chief demonstration of this approach was provided by the Government\u2019s heavy reliance on \ntrade taxes, notably import duties. Import duties tended to shelter domestic industries from \nforeign competition through tariffs, encouraging inefficiency while penalizing exporters. \n \n9.  An outward-looking approach to economic management was gradually adopted following \nthe Economic and Public Sector Reform Program in 2002. Efforts initially focused on trade \nreform. Tonga sought accession to the World Trade Organization in the mid-1990s, a process \nthat was completed in December 2005. As part of the accession, a consumption tax was \nintroduced in April 2005 to replace most trade taxes. Tonga has also ratified the Pacific Island \nCountries Trade Agreement and the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations, and is \nnegotiating an economic partnership agreement with the European Union. \n \n10.  Trade reform has been complemented by new foreign investment legislation. To date, \nforeign investment has been low\u2014an outcome that in part appears to be a reflection of local \nwariness of the change that foreign investors can bring. Nevertheless, many policy makers \nrecognize that foreign investment is essential to the realization of development goals set for the \ncommunity. The new legislation came into effect in April 2007. \n \n11.  The transparency and predictability needed by the private sector was enhanced by the \nadoption of new business licensing legislation. A participatory approach is now in place with the \nprivate sector to continue regulatory reform. \n \n12.  One  of  the  key  areas  to  be  addressed  is  access  to  land.  Both  local  and  foreign \ninvestment is constrained by the availability of land\u2014the brevity of the leases by which it is \nmade  available,  provisions  for  regular  rent  reviews,  and  the  weak  protection  provided  to \ninvestors. Land tenure systems are intimately tied in with the overall structure of society, and \nthis makes it extremely difficult to bring land management into line with the needs of a market-\nbased economy. Yet potential feasible areas of reform include revisions to the length of leases. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \n13.  The Government has been heavily involved in the provision of goods and services. \nTonga\u2019s  public  enterprises  leave  little  opportunity  for  the  private  sector,  and  thus  depress \neconomic growth. Public enterprises control 14%\u201322% of total fixed assets within the economy, \nyet contribute just over 6% to gross domestic product. Tonga\u2019s public enterprises currently \nachieve an overall return on average equity of 3.6%, well below the 10% target return. The \neconomic value destroyed by the public enterprise portfolio in Tonga during FY2002\u2013FY2006 is \nestimated to equal about half of the Government's total expenditure on health and education. As \nof 30 June 2009, 15 public enterprises were wholly owned by the state. They are involved in the \nprovision  of  infrastructure  services  as  well  as  a  range  of  commercial  activities.  Of  the  \nT$359 million infrastructure investment planned between FY2010 and FY2015, the total public \nenterprise investment plans make up T$170 million.  \n \n14.  Deficiencies  of  physical  transport  infrastructure,  principally  roads  and  wharves,  are \nrecognized  as  significant  constraints  to  business  and  commerce  across  the  country.  The \nmovement of agricultural produce in particular, on which the prosperity of the outer islands \nlargely depends, is greatly constrained by inadequacies of agricultural roads and wharves. \n \n15.  Tourist development also requires provision of physical infrastructure. The introduction \nof  private  sector  competition  into  infrastructure  provision  and  operation,  notably  in \ntelecommunications, has met with some success. Yet key infrastructure responsibilities remain \nwith  the  Government.  Budget  data  show  a  long-term  decline  in  funding  for  physical \ninfrastructure and maintenance, and funding is required for a backlog of needed investment. \nPublic enterprise legislation has been adopted to raise the performance of corporatized public \nproviders, but its application needs strengthening. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  45 \nFISCAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Fiscal Performance \n1.  The late 1990s and early 2000s were characterized by (i) strong calls for fiscal policy to \ncounter rising deficits; (ii) decisions to improve the strategic allocation of public resources (for \nexample in maintaining the proportion devoted to education and health); and most significantly, \n(iii) pressures to respond to demands for public service wage rises. Strong restrictions on public \nservice recruitment and allowances slowed the growth of the public wage and salary bill and the \nrevenue performance improved. Following 4 years of growing deficits, the Government budget \nmoved into surplus in FY2004 and remained in surplus in FY2005. \n \n2.  The public service strike and the resultant wage agreement (known as 60/70/80) then \ndominated FY2006. In late 2005, the Government entered into a public sector wage agreement \nin which it committed to implement salary increases for the public sector of between 60% and \n80% by FY2007, and to undertake regular salary reviews. The Government acted quickly to \nfund the pay increase. Cuts were made to expenditure on goods and services, maintenance, \nand capital expenditure (Figure A4). A civil service restructuring and downsizing exercise also \ntook place in the latter half of FY2006 aimed at reducing the number of civil servants by \napproximately 20%. \n \n3.  In total, 60/70/80 and the redundancy package created additional expenditure during \nFY2006\u2013FY2007  equivalent  to 15%  of  gross  domestic product  (GDP)  (in  each  year).  The \nadditional ongoing cost is estimated to fall to 10% of GDP in FY2008 (as one-time payments are \nmet and the number of civil servants is reduced). \n \n4.  The budget moved into deficit in FY2006, despite the expenditure cuts and sale of 20% \nof Westpac Bank of Tonga held by the Government. But strong revenue performance helped \nlimit the deficit to 2.2% of GDP in FY2006, and to result in a surplus of 1.1% of GDP in FY2007 \n(Figure A4). \n \n \nFigure A4: Budget Performance FY2006\u2013FY2010 \nFiscal Surplus/Deficit: FY2006-FY2010 Total Government Expenditure: FY2006-FY2010\n5 100%\n80%\n0\nP 60%\nD FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009e FY2010e\nf G -5 40%\no 20%\n \n%\n-10 0%\nFiscal Surplus/Deficit\nFY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009e FY2010e\n-15\nCurrent Expenditure\nCapital Expenditure\nTotal Government Expenditure\n \ne = estimated, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: Government of Tonga. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nB.  The Overall Fiscal Stance \n5.  The Government's fiscal position improved as a result of comprehensive reforms to the \ntax and customs system in 2008, coupled with prudent public expenditure management over the \nlast 4 years. This resulted in successive budget surpluses. The Expenditure Review Committee \n(ERC)  has  supported  improved  expenditure  management  through  reprioritization  measures \nwhen  and  where  appropriate,  thus  helping  to  ensure  a  balanced  budget.  In  2009,  the \nGovernment prepared the FY2010 budget using forward estimates as a first step to a medium-\nterm budget framework (MTBF). Further improvements in revenue administration through the \nestablishment of a debt recovery unit resulted in the recovery of $10 million in debt arrears and \nsignificant increases in corporate tax collections over the previous financial year. \n \n6.  The crisis impacted the fiscal position and the Government has moved to safeguard \nexpenditures  on  essential  services.  Significant  grant  assistance  of  T$25  million  from  the \nPeople's Republic of China helped the Government sustain expenditures. The Government also \nplaced a freeze on new spending within line ministries. However, the fiscal position has come \nunder  pressure  from  a  weaker  outlook  for  government  revenue,  as  well  as  the  cost  of  a \npreviously agreed 10% pay increase for public servants, which will take effect in FY2010. \n \n7.  While the Government is committed to improving infrastructure, it has had difficulty \nfunding costs from the tax revenue stream. For the most part, physical infrastructure has been \nestablished with the support of development partner financing. Deficiencies in infrastructure, \nparticularly  in  the  transport  sector,  including  roads  and  wharves,  are  seen  as  significant \nconstraints to medium-term growth. \n \nC.  Quality of the Revenue System \n8.  Revenue (including grants) has been rising steadily from about 26% of GDP in FY2000 \nto 44% of GDP in FY2009. Progress has been made on the revenue side of the budget, with the \ntax and customs system modernized as part of the economic reform program. Years of ad hoc \ndiscretionary interventions created a nontransparent, confusing, and widely criticized set of tax \npolicies in Tonga. As part of a set of comprehensive reforms in 2008, new income tax and \ncustoms legislation became effective\u2014the income tax threshold was raised from T$2,500 to \nT$7,400 per annum, a tax of 10% is now levied on income earners with earnings from T$7,400 \nto T$30,000, and 20% for those earning T$30,000 and above. The corporate tax rate was \nstreamlined at 25% for both residents and nonresidents with an annual turnover in excess of \nT$100,000.  Other  taxes  include  a  15%  consumption  tax  on  all  imported  and  domestically \nproduced goods and services (certain goods and services related to health and education, \nfinancial services, electricity, and public transport are exempt), and a vehicle tax. The reforms\u2014\ndriven by the need for Tonga to end its heavy reliance on revenue generated from customs \nrevenue given its World Trade Organization commitments\u2014removed the two-tier progressive \ncompany tax system and the penalty tax rate that was previously applied to foreign companies. \nThe simplified taxation system is far less distorted and simpler to apply.  \n \n9.  In FY2008, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 21.4%. In its inaugural \nyear,  consumption  tax  collections  amounted  to  T$53  million,  exceeding  expectations  by  \nT$7 million, although an analysis of the composition of border and inland revenue collections, \nand information on arrears, indicate that another T$2 million\u2013T$3 million can still be collected. \nTax arrears are relatively low at T$24.6 million at the end of FY2008 (most overdue income tax). \nHowever,  given  the  small  size  of  the  country  and  the  lack  of  scale,  tax  administration  is \nrelatively expensive. \n ", "Appendix 4  47 \n \n10.  The Revenue Services Administration Act provides the foundation for a modern system \nof  revenue  administration  based  on  self-assessment  and  voluntary  compliance.  With \nconsumption taxes on imported goods and import duties constituting nearly 50% of total tax \nrevenues, a significant revenue initiative is the introduction of a computerized, internet-based \ncustoms management system, which will speed up the clearance of goods and allow more \neffective checking of importers\u2019 documents and a greater focus on reducing revenue leakage \nthrough the ports. The new system will reduce the clerical inputs required for the clearance of \ngoods,  and  enable  importers  and  exporters  to  submit  customs  declarations.  The  reduced \nclerical input time for declarations will allow the reallocation of Customs Department personnel \nto investigate fraud, which will help improve collections. The first module of the system was \nlaunched in July 2009 and additional modules will be introduced during the first 12 months of \noperations, including extending the system to Vava\u2019u, the other main port in Tonga. A tax \ntribunal was established to handle tax appeals and hear applications for review of decisions \nmade by the Inland Revenue Department. In FY2009, the establishment of a debt recovery unit \nresulted in the collection of T$10 million in tax arrears, which was an improvement over past \nyears. The Government is aiming to collect T$8 million in FY2010.  \n \nD.  Quality of Public Expenditure \n11.  Although  overall  budget  control  has  been  satisfactory,  allocation  and  control  of \nexpenditures for individual items has been relatively weak. In FY2007, recurrent expenditures \ndeviated from budgeted amounts by less than 10%. According to the 2007 public expenditure \nand financial accountability (PEFA) assessment report, from FY2004 to FY2006, total primary \nexpenditure deviated by 2.4%, recurrent expenditure by 3.3%, and debt servicing by 13.8%. A \ncontingency  fund  was  established\u2014generally  set  at  5%  of  the  total  budget\u2014to  cover \nunforeseen  expenditures.  The  public  financial  management  system  is  comprehensive  in \nreporting; banking of all known government receipts and revenues into a consolidated fund is \nrequired. Budgetary and fiscal risk oversight is comprehensive, and public access to budget \ninformation is available once the budget is adopted. However, transparency is lacking for budget \nexecution  due  to  limited  information  available  on  actual  government  performance  in \nimplementing budgets and maintaining fiscal discipline. The total amount of arrears is less than \n2% of annual outlays. \n \n12.  In FY2003, the Government adopted the IMF Government Finance Statistics framework \nto  present  budget  estimates,  which  provides  a  better  presentation  of  information  on  total \nresources allocated by the Government, and allows for regional and international comparison. \nThis has only been partially implemented in recent budgets. The budget provides an adequate \npicture  of  general  government  activities.  Budgeting  has  been  greatly  strengthened  by  the \nadoption of the Public Finance Management Act, 2002. The act authorizes the minister of \nfinance to manage budget execution, enforce tighter fiscal discipline, and ensure that spending \nis within allocations. \n \n13.  Budget estimates are fully subject to authorization by appropriation in the legislative \nassembly. The Public Enterprises Act, 2002 provides a framework for monitoring the activities of \ngovernment enterprises and their relationships with the budget. In November 2007, the ERC, \nwhich is chaired by the Prime Minister, was established to improve supervision of overall \nbudgetary processes, review all expenditure requests from line ministries, and monitor budget \nperformance. To date, links between the budget and programs intended to achieve national \ndevelopment goals have been relatively weak. While programs are defined, linking expenditures \nto  programs  and  monitoring  outcomes  needs  to  be  improved.  Prioritization  of  budget \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \nexpenditure  is  not  well  defined  and  often  ad  hoc.  Ministries  report  on  some  indicators  of \nachievement, but this analysis is not effectively integrated into the preparation of subsequent \nbudgets. For example, the budget papers do not include a review of ministry performance \nagainst the indicators. The FY2009 budget, which was prepared on a cash basis, does not \ninclude any forward estimates. Tonga prepared the FY2010 budget using forward estimates as \na first step to a medium-term budget framework. While not well formalized and applied yet, such \na framework system will facilitate the Ministry of Finance's ability to allocate resources in a \nmanner consistent with the priorities outlined in the new National Strategic Planning Framework, \nwhich replaced the Strategic Development Plan Eight. Budgets will be prepared on the basis of \n3-year  corporate  plans  prepared  by  each  line  ministry  designed  to  operationalize  the \nachievement of national development goals, which will include performance indicators to allow \nfor  progress  monitoring.  The  Government  prepared  contingency  plans  for  the  potential \nreprioritization of and cuts in expenditure given the crisis.  \n \n14.  The 2007 PEFA report indicates that the bank reconciliations were delayed, resulting in \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance's  late  issuance  of  financial  statements.  Bank  reconciliation  for  all \nTreasury-managed bank accounts takes place less frequently than quarterly, or with backlogs of \nseveral months. Reconciliation and clearance of suspense accounts and advances take place \neither annually with more than 2 months\u2019 delay, or less frequently. However, since 2008, bank \nstatements are received and reconciled daily. The timeliness of current year reconciliations has \nbeen significantly improved, reducing delays from 12 months to around 1\u20132 months. Some \nconcerns have been raised about the accuracy of information, but this does not fundamentally \nundermine its basic usefulness. The minister of finance presents a monthly fiscal update to the \ncabinet (introduced in 2007), including the cash position. The audit for 2008 had a 2-year delay, \nalthough the requirement is within 6 months. However, the Government has cleared the backlog \nof accounts up to FY2008, which are currently with the auditor general.  \n \nE.  The FY2010 Budget \n15.  The Government adopted an expansionary fiscal stance to counter the impact of the \ncrisis.  The  FY2010  budget  aims  to  support  key  social  expenditures  while  maintaining \nmacroeconomic stability. The budget forecasts a fiscal surplus (excluding the proposed program \ngrant) of T$10.8 million, while significantly increasing expenditure. However, after projected debt \nrepayments of T$12.4 million that will fall due during FY2010, the financing gap is T$6.6 million \n(about 1.0% of GDP). Importantly, although Tonga\u2019s budget includes both in-kind and cash \nexpenditures, the Government Finance Statistics is presented on cash basis which therefore \nexcludes a portion of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s central business district \nand associated public works. These are being financed by a T$120 million reconstruction loan \nfrom  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  to  the Government  of  Tonga.  Table  A4 provides  an \noverview of key macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates over 5 years. \n \n16.  Underlying revenue declined by 10.3% in FY2009 but the Government forecast it to \nincrease by 7.0% in FY2010 on the basis of better compliance and positive government growth \nforecasts. However, the most revised forecast\u2014based on collections at the end of August \n2009\u2014projects a further decline of 18.9% reflecting weak economic conditions in Tonga\u2019s major \ntrading partner economies, which have impacted remittances and export demand. Tax revenue, \nin particular, is projected to decline by 11.4% in FY2010 (rather than the 16.7% increase in \ncollections earlier forecast). Grants (not including the proposed Asian Development Bank [ADB] \n ", "Appendix 4  49 \ngrant) are forecast to decline from the T$44.9 million1 budget outcome in FY2009 to T$37.9 \nmillion in FY2010. \n \nTable A4: Summary Macroeconomic and Fiscal Aggregates \n \nItem  Unit  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009a  FY2010b  FY2010c \nReal GDP growth  % per annum  0.3  (1.7)  2.7  (0.4)  1.7  0.4 \nInflation   % per annum  7.0  5.1  9.8  4.7  1.7  1.2 \n               \nGovt. revenue               \nRevenue  % of GDP  25.2  24.8  25.2  22.6  24.2  18.3 \n- Tax revenue  % of GDP  21.1  21.1  21.4  18.8  21.1  19.7 \n- Tax revenue  % change per    3.0  10.4  (7.5)  16.7  (11.4) \nannum \n- Tax revenue  T$ million  122.2  126.0  139.1  128.7  150.2  114.0 \nGovt. expenditure               \nTotal expenditure  % of GDP  30.0  27.5  24.9    26.6  28.6  28.6 \nCapital expenditure  % of GDP  0.8  0.9  0.5  2.5  1.7  1.7 \nCurrent expenditure  % of GDP  29.2  26.4  24.4  24.1  26.9  26.9 \n- Personnel costs  % of GDP  0.8  0.9  0.5  2.5  1.7  1.7 \n- Personnel costs  % of current  58.9  50.4  44.3  46.1  40.4  40.4 \nexpenditure \nBudget balance               \nOverall balance  % of GDP  (2.2)  1.1  1.7  1.7  (1.0)  (10.3) \nGeneral govt. net               \ndebt \nGross debt  % of GDP  37.3  34.4  36.4  39.8  43.3  43.3 \nCash and liquid  % of GDP  5.7  5.2  6.6  6.8  6.8  6.8 \nassetsd \nNet debt  % of GDP  31.6  29.2  29.8  33  36.5  36.5 \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Estimate. \nb Budget. \nc Revised estimates for October 2009 release. \nd Cash and investment balance (as at 30 June for each fiscal year). \nSource: Government finance statistics; International Monetary Fund; Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  Overall expenditure, which rose by 10.3% in FY2009, is projected to increase by a \nfurther 13.7% in FY2010. Expenditure on wages, salaries, and contributions will rise by 18.8%,2 \nother current expenditure by 26.3%, while capital expenditure from the budget (not including the \nreconstruction loan funds from the People\u2019s Republic of China) will fall by 32%.3 Other current \nexpenditure, which includes other purchases of goods and services, interest payments, and \nsubsidies, increased by 24.6% from FY2009. The FY2010 budget provides an overall increase \n                                                 \n3 This is the FY2009 actual amount, which reflects an extraordinary grant from the People\u2019s Republic of China of \nT$26 million, which was not included in the FY2009 budget although this amount will be disclosed in the public \naccount for FY2009. \n2  The salary and wage expenditure in the budget comprises several items that are not strictly part of the public \nsector wage bill, such as allowances for legislators, the privy purse, and district and town officers salaries. The \nsalary component of the salary and wage line item in the budget estimates constitutes about 77% of the total, \nincluding employer contributions. Excluding this latter item, which is mandated in the administrative regulations to \nthe 1998 Retirement Fund Act, the total salary and wage component of the FY2010 budget will rise by 2.2%. \n3  Capital expenditure in FY2009 was distorted by the spending of about T$5 million on the purchase of a high \ncommission in Auckland and the acquisition of land for a park in the center of Nuku'alofa. \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \nin the allocation to education (19%), health services (21%), and social security and welfare \n(42.4%). \n \n18.  Since a substantial portion of the rebuilding of Nuku'alofa and associated works is \nfunded by the reconstruction loan,4 and because Tonga\u2019s accounting conventions mean that \nthis loan is not included directly in the budget, the budget estimates show a fall in capital \nexpenditure of T$5.6 million.5 Including expenditure under the reconstruction loan, total capital \nexpenditure amounts to T$51.8 million in FY2010 compared with T$15.2 million in FY20096\u2014an \nincrease of 241%. This large increase in capital spending, coupled with effective enforcement of \nhigh local content in the implementation of capital works, will promote job creation and private \nsector activity. \n \n19.  Following recent revisions to the FY2010 revenue forecast, the fiscal deficit is projected \nto be 10.3% of GDP, which represents a decline of 706% over the previous year. Net financing \nrequirements\u2014after accounting for debt repayments\u2014now stands at T$42.8 million.  \n \nF.  Procurement \n20.  Based on the findings of a 2003 procurement assessment undertaken by ADB and the \nWorld Bank, and a subsequent World Bank operations procurement review, the Government \ndeveloped plans to establish an effective legal and regulatory framework governing public \nprocurement,  including  guidelines,  manuals,  and  capacity  development.  With  World  Bank \nassistance,  the  Government  passed  the  new  Procurement  Act,  2009;  established  a \nprocurement committee; and set up a procurement section within the Ministry of Finance and \nNational Planning. The Australian Agency for International Development and the New Zealand \nAgency for International Development have been supporting the Government in strengthening \ncapacity for the implementation of the procurement system. Regulations for public procurement \nand the preparation of a procurement manual and standard documentation are being prepared, \nand  procurement  training  of  government  officials  delivered,  with  support  of  the  Australian \nAgency for International Development support. \n \nG.  Debt Sustainability \n21.  The achievement of a sustainable debt position is a key result of the economic reform. \nDebt distress risk remains high with total external debt averaging around 39% of GDP over the \n9 years until FY2008. The Government has made efforts to reduce debt through more prudent \nfiscal management. Most of external debt is concessionary; however, increased borrowing from \nChina  Eximbank  to  fund  reconstruction  efforts  and  associated  public  works  has  increased \nTonga\u2019s vulnerability to debt distress. \n \n22.  Public external debt was the equivalent of 30.8% of GDP at the end of 2009, compared \nwith 28.9% at the end of FY2008 and 32.6% at the end of FY2007. Significant indebtedness will \nbe incurred from additional drawing down of the reconstruction loan over the next 2 years. The \nloan is on concessional terms, with a 5-year grace period and a 20-year term at 2% interest. \nWhen the drawdown is complete, the net present value of foreign debt will be approximately \n36% of GDP. The debt will be 290% of net exports and tourism earnings. When remittances are \nincluded, indebtedness in terms of this measure falls to a much more manageable 135% of \n                                                 \n4  The loan, which bears a 2% interest rate, will be repaid over 20 years with a 5-year grace period.  \n5  One-time items that are property purchases inflated capital spending in FY2009 by approximately T$5 million. \n6  The China Eximbank loan contributed T$5.0 million to capital expenditure in FY2009. This does not appear as a \ncash appropriation under capital expenditure, but is part of the net lending component of the FY2009 outcome. \n ", "Appendix 4  51 \nGDP. Any further borrowing on nonconcessional terms needs to be carefully and prudently \nconsidered given the current weak economic performance, and to ensure that new borrowings \nare used to finance projects that increase Tonga's productive capacity. \n ", "52  Appendix 5 \nPUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR ASSESSMENT \n1.  The assessment draws heavily on an Asian Development Bank (ADB) comparative \nstudy of state-owned enterprises in the Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga.1 Some coverage is also \nprovided on complementary policy measures to promote private sector development and reform \nof the public sector. \n \nA.  Public Enterprise Performance \n2.  Tonga\u2019s public enterprises leave little opportunity for the private sector and depress \neconomic growth. Public enterprises control 14%\u201322% of total fixed assets within the economy, \nyet contribute just over 6% to gross domestic product. Tonga\u2019s public enterprises currently \nachieve an overall return on average equity of 3.6%, well below the 10% target return. The \neconomic value destroyed by the public enterprise portfolio in Tonga during FY2002\u2013FY2006 is \nestimated to equal around half of the government's total expenditure on health and education \nfor the same period. \n3.  As of 30 June 2009, 15 public enterprises were wholly owned by the state. They are \ninvolved in the provision of infrastructure services as well as a range of commercial activities \n(Table A5). Of the T$359 million infrastructure investment planned over the next 5 years, the \ntotal public enterprise investment plans make up T$170 million.  \n4.  Only the Tonga Communications Corporation has consistently met the target of 10% \nreturn on equity in recent years (Table A5). None of the other enterprises are covering their \ncosts of capital. Preliminary indications are that in 2008, the portfolio will only return 3.6%. \nImproving the performance of the public enterprise portfolio requires (i) completion of ongoing \neffort to rationalize the remaining enterprises in the government's portfolio, which may include \nrestructuring and divesting of activities that can be conducted more efficiently by the private \nsector; (ii) continued capacity development in corporate governance to strengthen directors\u2019 \nability to serve as effective stewards of their public enterprises; and (iii) an amendment to the \nPublic Enterprise Act to place public enterprises on a firm commercial footing, imposing hard \nbudget constraints, strengthening governance by requiring the appointment of appropriately \nskilled  private  sector  directors,  and  stipulating  that  the  provision  of  community  service \nobligations be on commercial terms.  \nB.  Progress in Public Enterprise Reform \n \n5.  Tonga's public enterprise reform process has been under way in earnest since 2002, \nwhen the country passed the Public Enterprises Act. Over the subsequent 5 years, with support \nfrom a series of ADB technical assistance (TA)2 projects, the Government strengthened the \ncorporate governance of public enterprises, established a financial performance monitoring \nframework, trained directors and senior officials on requirements of the Public Enterprises Act, \ncreated the Ministry of Public Enterprises, developed its capacity to monitor and rationalize the \npublic enterprise portfolio, and rationalized a number of enterprises.  \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2009.

The third phase of ADB support for public enterprise reform (footnote 2) focused on \n(i) rationalizing  five  public  enterprises,3 (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  public  enterprise \ndirectors,  (iii)  developing  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprise  staff  charged  with \nmonitoring public enterprise performance, and (iv) implementing the rationalization program. \nDuring this period, the Government resolved to remove all ministers and public servants from \nthe boards of directors by the end of 2008. This target has not yet been fully achieved, although \nprogress  was  made  with  five  boards  having  only  private  sector  directors.  Further,  board \nrestructurings are planned for the 4th quarter of 2009 and mid-2010.  \n7.  The main outcomes were the first privatization of a Tongan public enterprise with the \nsale in 2008 of the Government\u2019s majority shareholding in Leiola Duty Free; the liquidation in \nFY2009  of  Tongatapu  Machinery  Pool,  which  made  its  assets  available  to  private  sector \ncontractors who were thereafter able to compete on an equal basis; and the divestiture in 2008 \n                                                 \n3  Leiola Duty Free, Tongatapu Machinery Pool, Shipping Corporation of Polynesia, Tonga Timber, and International \nDateline Hotel. \n ", "54  Appendix 5 \nof the Government\u2019s minority shareholding in Westpac Bank of Tonga. In 2008, the Government \npurchased the assets of Shoreline Power and transferred them into a new public enterprise, \nTonga Power, in anticipation of future rationalization. Strategies were prepared for the Shipping \nCorporation of Polynesia, Tonga Timber, and International Dateline Hotel. These strategies are \ncurrently under implementation, along with the liquidation of Tonga Investments.  \n8.  A fourth phase of ADB support is expected to be approved in 2009. This TA, will \n(i) complete the rationalization of the three public enterprises carried over from the third phase;4 \n(ii) develop and implement rationalization plans for another eight enterprises;5 (iii) continue \ntraining  for  directors,  managers,  and  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprise  staff;  and  (iv)  prepare \namendments  to  the  Public  Enterprise  Act  to  strengthen  commercial  governance  practices. \nProgress under the fourth phase rationalization program has exceeded expectations. In the first \n4 months of the TA, the cabinet approved the tender for Tonga Timber, to be implemented in \nthe 4th quarter of 2009, and rationalization strategies were developed for the Waste Authority, \nTonga Water Board, and Tonga Power. Strategy development for Tonga Communications, \nTonga Broadcasting, and Tonga Development Bank is ongoing. On the five restructured boards, \na total of eight ministers, civil servants, and politicians have been replaced by private sector \ndirectors.  Amendments  to  the  Public  Enterprise  Act  were  prepared,  and  cabinet  approval \nsecured for the policy issues to be addressed by the amendment.  \nC.   Unfinished Business \n \n9.  Upon completion of the fourth phase in July 2010, all but three public enterprises6 will \nhave completed or be well on the way to completing their rationalization programs. Corporate \ngovernance practices will have been significantly strengthened, as will the legal basis for the \ncommercial orientation of the public enterprises. However, public enterprise reform takes time, \nas individual rationalization strategies are developed, considered, endorsed by the Government, \nand then implemented. Therefore, the reform process will need to continue well beyond 2010, \nas  the  legal  and  governance  reforms  are  phased  in,  and  the  rationalization  plans  fully \nimplemented. While the reforms currently envisaged will produce many benefits in terms of \nreduced drain on budget resources and increased return on capital, the opportunity remains to \npursue  a  range  of  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangements,  or  full  privatization  of  some \nenterprises remaining in government ownership. \nD.  Complementary Policies for Promotion of Private Sector Development \n \n10.  Reform of public enterprises must be accompanied by an improved environment for \nprivate sector development if the benefits of public enterprise reform are to be fully realized, and \nthe objective of private sector-led development achieved. In 2008, ADB prepared a private \nsector assessment that analyzed the barriers to private sector development in Tonga.7 This \nshowed that the productivity of both labor and capital has been low, resulting in poor returns on \ninvestment. Few new businesses have started and existing ones have been slow to expand. \nJob creation has been insufficient to employ the growing number of school leavers looking for \nwork; after adjusting for inflation, wages and salaries have not risen. The main constraints to \ngreater private sector development identified by the report are: \n                                                 \n4  Shipping Corporation of Polynesia, Tonga Timber, and International Dateline Hotel. \n5  Tonga  Power,  Tonga  Water  Board,  Waste  Authority,  Tonga  Broadcasting,  Tonga  Communications,  Tonga \nDevelopment Bank, Tonga Airports, and Ports Authority of Tonga. \n6  Tonga Post, Tonga Market, and Tonga Print. \n7  ADB. 2008.

The Government has made significant progress in creating a better environment for the \nprivate sector. Priority areas for action include the following:  \n(i)  Finalize the 5-year infrastructure investment plan covering both core government \nand public enterprise infrastructure investment. \n(ii)  Pass the Companies Amendment Bill. \n(iii)  Operationalize the Companies Registry. \n(iv)  Pass the Personal Property Securities Bill. \n(v)  Conduct a review of license requirements under the Business License Act and \nprovide recommendations for their reform. \n(vi)  Complete the review of the Foreign Investment Act and pass amendments as \nrequired. \n(vii)  Implement the electronic registry to support the new Personal Property Security \nAct. \n(viii)  Increase provision of microfinance. \n(ix)  The Royal Land Commission to complete its work. \n \nE.  Required Complementary Policies: Reform of the Public Sector \n \n12.  Low productivity of the Tonga public sector is one of the causal factors of low growth. \nUntil 2001, the public service was politicized with control highly centralized\u2014all public sector \nappointments and promotions were made by the cabinet. Following the 2001 decision to reform \nthe  civil  service,  the  Public  Service  Commission  was  established\u2014with  ADB  support8\u2014to \noversee all aspects of public sector personnel issues. However, the intended reforms were not \nfully  achieved.  The  system  of  wage  adjustment  was  implemented  sporadically,  with  large \nincreases being followed by several years of public sector salaries being eroded by inflation. \nThe  personnel  management  system  did  not  reward  above-average  performance,  with \npromotions being granted on the basis of seniority rather than merit. The civil service continued \nto be overstaffed, employing more than 4% of the population, nearly double that of several other \nPacific island countries. Despite this, service standards were often low.  \n13.  The erosion of the real value of public sector salaries between 2000 and 2005, when no \npay increases were provided, led to a public sector strike at the end of 2005. The settlement of \nthe strike resulted in a large rise in the public sector wage bill. Following the settlement and to \nmaintain  macroeconomic  stability,  the  Government  implemented  a  program  of  voluntary \nredundancies, which resulted in an 18% reduction in the number of government employees. The \n                                                 \n8  ADB.

Manila (Loan \n1904-TON[SF]). \n ", "56  Appendix 5 \nbudgetary impact of the pay increase and the redundancy program was substantial. The overall \nwage and salary bill of the public sector, including redundancy payments, increased to more \nthan 17% of GDP in FY2006. Redundancy payouts continued in FY2007, also affecting the \nwage  and  salary  bill  in  that  year.  However,  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  government \nemployees meant that the ratio of wages and salaries to GDP excluding redundancy payments \nremained below 12% of GDP, which is not substantially out of line with public sector wage bills \nin other Pacific island economies. \n \n14.  The management of public service personnel policies is being overhauled. The main \nelements of the reform include \n(i)  rationalizing the number of staff at each grade and activity to flatten the structure \nof the public service salary grades;  \n(ii)  eliminating automatic merit pay increases to reward above-average performers; \n(iii)  introducing biennial  public sector pay  reviews  to  ensure that  salary demand \npressures do not build up during periods when inflation is rising; \n(iv)  streamlining personnel systems by introducing consistent rules regarding timing \nof performance reviews and merit increases; \n(v)  conducting annual performance assessments that focus on outputs to make staff \nand their supervisors accountable for results; \n(vi)  implementing major changes in leave policies, which will result in substantial \nsavings\u2014by some estimates about T$8 million over 3 years; and \n(vii)  introducing a new system for controlling public sector wages. Each ministry\u2019s \nsalary and wage budget allocation will be fixed, with no overages permitted. The \nministries will have the discretion to allocate salaries among its personnel, but \nthe Public Service Commission controls the number of positions at each pay \nlevel. \n \n ", "    Appendix 6  57 \nVULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT \n1.  The nature of poverty in Tonga relates more to lack of access to quality essential \nservices such as water and sanitation, health and education, as well as lack of income-earning \nopportunities, rather than hunger or destitution. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted \nseveral participatory assessments of hardship in various Pacific countries, including Tonga, \nduring 2001\u20132006.1 Through this process, a definition of hardship in the Pacific was developed \nto include \n(i)  lack of access to basic services such as health care, education, and clean water; \n(ii)  lack  of  opportunities  to  participate  fully  in  the  socioeconomic  life  of  the \ncommunity; and \n(iii)  lack of access to productive resources and income generation support systems \n(rural credit, capital, markets, skills) to meet the basic needs of the household, \nand/or customary obligations to the extended family, village community and/or \nthe church. \n \n2.  Tonga has been successful in achieving human development outcomes in terms of \nprimary school enrollment, literacy, under-five mortality rate, and life expectancy. Tonga ranked \nfirst  among  the  six  Pacific  island  countries  included  in  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme 2008 Human Development Report.2 However, challenges remain in identifying and \nproviding adequate assistance to the most vulnerable population groups. In urban areas, access \nto cash income is higher than in rural areas, but access to own-produced food is lower and cash \nrequirements  for  food  and  nonfood  expenditure  are  higher.  In  rural  areas,  poverty  is \ncharacterized more as poor access to quality essential services, including health, education, \nand transport.  \n \n3.  In 2006, the population of Tonga was estimated to be 101,991, with almost one-quarter \nof the population located in the country's capital Nuku'alofa, and around one-third in the outer \nislands (Vava'u, Ha'apai, Eua, and Niuas), with the remainder of the population located on \nTongatapu outside of the capital.  \n \n4.  In Tonga, strong family and community networks provide an important informal social \nsafety net system. Tonga has one of the highest remittance flows in the world as a percentage \nof gross domestic product\u201431% in 2008. Many families receive remittances, which mostly \ncome from Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Remittances provide a much-needed \nsource  of  cash  income,  particularly  for  poorer  households  that  often  have  few  other \nopportunities for income generation. Church and community organizations also play a large role \nin providing social services such as education. However, the current economic downturn in the \nworld  economy,  including  the  main  source  markets  for  Tonga,  has  resulted  in  decreasing \nremittances.3 As of June 2009, remittances were down 14% year-on-year. As a result, the \nexisting informal social safety net system in Tonga will come under increasing stress. \n \nA.  The Poverty Situation in Tonga \n5.  Poverty in Tonga is assessed using a national food poverty line of T$3,867 per annum, \nand a national basic needs poverty line of T$8,061 per annum.4 Using the headcount index as a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila (August). \n4  Statistics Department. 2002. Report on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey: 2001\u20132002. Nukualofa. A \nnew household income and expenditure survey was carried out in Tonga at the beginning of 2009; however, the \n ", "58  Appendix 6 \nmeasure of poverty, approximately 6.7% of the total population of Tonga is estimated to be \nliving below the food poverty line, while 23% (almost one-quarter) is living below the basic \nneeds poverty line. The highest share of households living below both poverty lines is in \nnonurban areas of Tongatapu (8.7% living below the food poverty line and 28% below the basic \nneeds  poverty  line),  while  the  lowest  share  of  households  living  in  poverty  is  located  in \nNuku'alofa.  \n \nTable A6: Household Income Poverty  \n(%) \nIncome \nFood  Basic Needs \nLocation  Poverty Line  Poverty Line \nTonga  6.7  23.0 \nNuku'alofa  4.1  19.1 \nRest of Tongatapu  8.7  28.0 \nOuter Islands  7.0  22.8 \nSource: 2001 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. \n \n6.  According to the 2006 census, 57% of the Tongan population above the age of 15 was \neconomically active with approximately 37% of the country's working population engaged in \nwage employment. In Nuku'alofa, around 80% of households receive cash income in the form of \nwages, which accounts for approximately 46% of total cash income. For households in the \nlowest income quintile, fewer households receive wage income (60%). However, for these \nhouseholds, wages account for a larger share of total cash income (58%). In other areas of \nTongatapu and the outer islands, only between 40% and 45% of households receive wage \nincome, with the number being significantly lower for households in the bottom quintile (18%\u2013\n22%). Whereas wages account for around 50% of cash income for all households in nonurban \nTongatapu and the outer islands, they account for a larger proportion of total cash income in the \npoorest  households  (around  75%).  About  21%  of  households  are  engaged  in  subsistence \nagriculture in rural areas, compared with just 9% of urban households. \n \n7.  However, despite relatively high rates of labor force participation in Tonga, rising youth \nunemployment remains a concern. In 2003, 12% of youths (ages 15\u201324) were unemployed \ncompared  with  the  national  average  of  5.2%.  The  outer  islands  had  the  highest  youth \nunemployment  rates  (18%  in  Niuas  and  16%  in  'Eua),  while  Tongatapu  had  the  lowest \nproportion of unemployed youth (13%).5 \n \n8.  Remittances provide an important source of income to the majority of households in \nTonga. According to the 2001 household income and expenditure survey, 75% of all households \nreceived  some  remittances  from  overseas.  In  nonurban  Tongatapu,  95%  of  households \nreceived remittances, which accounted for approximately 37% of total cash income. Among \nhouseholds  in  the  bottom  quintile  in  nonurban  Tongatapu,  56%  received  remittances, \naccounting  for  50%  of  total  income.  In  Nuku'alofa  and  the  outer  islands,  around  70%  of \nhouseholds received remittances accounting for 26%\u201328% of total cash income. Although the \nproportion  of  the  poorest  households  receiving  remittances  in  these  two  regions  is  lower \n(around 56%), remittances contribute to a larger share to their total cash income (42%\u201344%).  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \ndata from this survey was not available at the time of preparing this assessment. As a result, data from the 2001 \nhousehold income and expenditure survey is used.  \n5  Statistics Department. 2006 Census. Nuku'alofa. \n ", "    Appendix 6  59 \nB.  Social Protection \n9.  Remittances are the most important form of safety net in Tonga, providing a cushion \nagainst shocks to household income, as well as funding important living expenses including \neducation fees, transport costs, and social obligations. Although the Government has been \nactive in promoting universal access to health and education services as a means of promoting \nequality and improving living standards, it provides few other formal social safety net programs. \nInstead  community  and  church  organizations  are  very  active  in  providing  social  services, \nparticularly  to  vulnerable  groups  including  people  with  disabilities,  women  suffering  from \ndomestic abuse, and children from low-income households.  \n \nC.  Access to Education Services \n10.  Tonga has achieved almost universal primary enrollment. In 2006, 98% of children ages \n6\u201314 were enrolled in school, with little or no difference between enrollment rates for boys and \ngirls. However, after the age of 15, enrollment falls significantly, with 15% of 16-year olds not \nenrolled in school (footnote 4). In 2006, the literacy rate of the 15- to 25-year-old population was \n98.4% for males and 98.8% for females. However, despite the high enrollment rates, quality of \neducation is an issue. \n \n11.  Government schools provide education to the bulk of primary students. Government \nschools are located on all islands, and primary education is free of charge. However, despite \nreceiving  government  grants  to  cover  some  school  operating  budgets,  communities  and \nhouseholds are also expected to make significant financial contributions to schools. According \nto a participatory poverty study carried out by ADB (footnote 1), community and household \ncontributions impose hardships for some. In addition, poorer communities have a lower ability to \nmake contributions to schools. However, the Government recently started allocating grants to \nschools based on need under the Tonga Education Support Program, so that all schools are \nable to achieve minimum standards, which can be seen as a significant pro-poor policy.  \n \n12.  Churches  and  nongovernment  organizations  provide  the  majority  of  students  with \nsecondary education, with a very limited number of places available for students at government \nschools. Gaining entrance to government schools is highly competitive, and the majority of \nstudents from poorer households attend church and community-run schools. Nongovernment \nschools also provide some education services to people living with disabilities. \n \nD.  Access to Health Services \n13.  The underlying principles of health development in Tonga have been equity, universal \naccessibility,  sociocultural  acceptability,  and  affordability.  As  a  result  most  health  services \nprovided by the Government are free of charge to the public, and nearly the entire population \nhas access to medical services through the national hospital on the main island in Nuku'alofa, \ndistrict hospitals in the three main island groups, and 13 health centers around the country. \nDespite persistent staff shortages within the Ministry of Health, Tonga has been successful in \nachieving good health indicators. Life expectancy is 73 years for women and 67.3 years for \nmen. Most Tongan women (95%) give birth in the presence of skilled birth attendants. Maternal \nmortality is low at 36.5/100,000 live births and the infant mortality rate is 19/1000 births.6  \n \n                                                 \n6  Government of Tonga. Ministry of Health, 2007. Annual Health Report. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n ", "60  Appendix 6 \n14.  The share of government spending in the health sector has been increasing, accounting \nfor 10%\u201312% of total recurrent expenditure over the past 10 years\u2014the second largest budget \nallocation after education. Development partner funding also plays a large role in supporting the \nhealth sector through investments in water supply, sanitation, and hospitals. User fees are being \nintroduced on a small scale. Overseas medical treatment accounts for about 3% of government \nhealth expenditure.  \n \n15.  The  incidence  of  noncommunicable  lifestyle  diseases  such  as  diabetes  and \nhypertension associated with obesity is increasing. For example, the current incidence of type II \ndiabetes of 18% has nearly doubled over the past 25 years.  \n \n16.  Notwithstanding  generally  good  health  indicators,  rural  health  care  services  are \nperceived to be inadequate due to the shortages of trained staff and shortages of medical \nsupplies. Community and nongovernment organizations are also active in the provision of health \ncare services including family planning services, drug and alcohol counseling, services for \npeople living with disabilities, dentistry, and care for those who suffer from domestic violence. \nCurrently, the public sector has no services directed to the disabled or the mentally ill, or for \npalliative care. \n \nE.  Infrastructure Services \n17.  Almost the entire urban population of Tonga has access to electricity, clean water, and \nsanitation services. However, the quality of basic services in the outer islands is generally poor. \nAlthough a majority of the population has access to clean water supplies, these are often not \navailable 24 hours a day in many outer island communities. Also, while 80% of all households in \nTongatapu have a flush toilet, this percentage is much lower in the outer islands of Ha\u2019apai \n(38%) and Niuas 34% (footnote 5).  \n \n18.  Deficiencies in transport infrastructure\u2014in particular, roads and wharves\u2014are significant \nconstraints  on  the  development  of  business  and  commerce.  Tourist  development  is  also \nconstrained by the adequacy of physical infrastructure. Poor transport services to the outer \nislands limit income generating opportunities, particularly in the agriculture sector, due to limited \naccess to internal and overseas markets. Poor infrastructure in the outer islands also plays a \nrole in fuelling rural\u2013urban migration, as the population of the outer islands moves to urban \nareas in search of a better quality of life. \n \nF.  Conclusions \n19.  Hardship in Tonga is characterized by the lack of access to quality basic services and \nlack of cash income-earning opportunities rather than extreme poverty. This is illustrated by the \nfact  that  Tonga  has  the  best  human  development  indicators  in  the  Pacific  region.  The \nGovernment  is  active  in  the  provision  of  health  and  education  services.  However, \nnongovernment organizations and churches provide the largest range of social services to the \nmost  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population.  Financial  contributions  from  households  and \ncommunities fund a large share of the operating budgets for many of these organizations. \n \n20.  Since no formal welfare system, aside from pensions, exists in Tonga, remittances \nprovide the most important social safety nets in the country with around 75% of households \nreceiving some cash remittances. Remittances provide an important source of income to lower-\nincome households allowing them to pay for school fees, transport, and social obligations. \nHowever, remittances in Tonga had fallen by 14% as of June 2009 on a year-on-year basis, and \n ", "    Appendix 6  61 \nfuture  trends  are  uncertain.  Although  the  exact  impact  of  falling  remittances  on  the  most \nvulnerable groups in Tonga is not yet known, pressure is expected on the social service delivery \nand safety net systems. \n \n21.  The  Government  needs  to  improve  its  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  decreasing \nremittances on the vulnerable and provide short-term assistance to those most affected and \nunable to cope. In the longer term, it needs to better identify these groups and design effective \nsocial assistance targeting systems to complement existing informal safety nets. \n \n \n ", "62  Appendix 7 \nSTATUS OF THE RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS \n \n1.  In its publication Taking the Helm, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) outlines a series \nof suggested steps for Pacific countries in dealing with the global economic crisis.1 It also \noutlines actions that are best avoided. This appendix provides an assessment of the Tongan \nGovernment's response to the impacts of the crisis against the \"Ten Steps\" or policy actions \nsuggested in Taking the Helm. \n \nA.  The Ten Steps \n \n2.  Step 1: Track and understand the impact of the global economic crisis. The main \nstatistical collections such as gross domestic product (GDP) and other national accounts data \nare readily available from the Statistics Department, but these are only released on an annual \nbasis. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning website releases semiannual economic \nassessment as part of the budget process and provides a useful interpretation of the statistics; a \nquarterly  fiscal  update  is  available  locally.  The  National  Reserve  Bank  of  Tonga  (NRBT) \nprovides monetary data; and statistics on remittances, tourist arrivals, and tourism receipts on a \ntimely basis. Trade data is available from the Statistics Department after a one-quarter lag. \nMonitoring is hindered by (i) the 12-month lag before release of national accounts; the quality of \nbudget outturn data and absence of lead indicators; and some inconsistencies between data \nfrom the Statistics Department and the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, notably \nsector data. \n \n3.  Step  2:  Encourage  open  policy  dialogue.  The  Government  has  made  efforts  to \nengage  the  private  sector  in  policy  dialogue  through  the  National  Economic  Development \nCouncil, chaired by the Prime Minister, and the regulatory reform task force, chaired by the \nminister of finance. The council identifies and recommends to the cabinet policy initiatives for \ndeveloping the private sector, overseeing reform implementation, and reducing the cost of doing \nbusiness.  \n \n4.  Furthermore,  as  part  of  the  new  corporate  planning  process  envisaged  under  the \nNational Strategic Planning Framework, government ministries are expected to carry out their \nown consultations with all relevant key stakeholders. \n \n5.  Step 3: Get the monetary policy stance right. NRBT employs three main instruments \nof monetary management: (i) issuance of NRBT notes, (ii) credit ceilings, and (iii) reserve \nrequirements. NRBT\u2019s actions are guided by two primary considerations: maintaining foreign \nreserves at a minimum of 3 months of imports and keeping inflation below 10% per annum. \n \n6.  During the second half of 2008 and into 2009, NRBT tightened monetary policy to limit \nthe pace of credit growth in order to limit inflation and maintain financial sector stability. Credit \nfrom the banking system to the private sector fell by 7.8% in the fiscal year ending in July 2009, \nwhile reserves recovered to 5.4 months of import cover, largely as a result of lower imports. \nNRBT reduced reserve asset requirements from 10% to 5% effective from August 2009 to \nstimulate economic activity.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Taking the Helm\u2014A Policy Brief on a Response to the Global Economic Crisis. Manila. \n ", "    Appendix 7  63 \n7.  Step 4: Maintain a competitive exchange rate. Tonga maintains a broadly competitive \nexchange rate.The trade-weighted exchange rate appreciated by 9.4% in real effective terms in \nFY2009. As a result of the significant currency realignment that occurred during the second half \nof 2008 and early 2009, the cross rates of the pa\u2019anga against trading partner currencies \nchanged substantially (appreciating compared with the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and \ndepreciating  against  the  US  dollar).  However,  recently  the  International  Monetary  Fund \nestimated  that  the  pa'anga  is  overvalued  by  about  10%.  Nevertheless,  it  found  that  the \nexchange rate was consistent with external stability, since the current account deficit can be \nfinanced by official and private capital inflows. \n \n8.  Step 5: \u201cCut and trim\u201d low-priority government expenditure. The establishment of \nthe  Expenditure  Review  Committee  (ERC)  to  review  budget  policy  and  overall  resources \nallocation provides an important senior mechanism for identifying and trimming low priority \nexpenditure. For the FY2010 budget, a total of T$18 million in potential budget savings was \nidentified in response to the worsening fiscal situation. These include \n(i)  T$4.2 million in deferred debt repayments; \n(ii)  T$4 million from the government's contingency fund; \n(iii)  T$2 million from purchases of goods and services (across all ministries); and \n(iv)  T$500,000 from travel and communication (across all ministries). \n \n9.  Step 6: Raise the revenue effort. Tonga has taken significant steps to raise revenue \nover the past 2 years. Extensive tax reform was implemented in 2008, which removed the two-\ntier progressive company tax system and the penalty tax rate that previously applied to foreign \ncompanies. The simplified taxation system is far less distorted and simpler to apply. \n \n10.  The  implementation  of  the  new  Income  Tax  Act,  2007;  Customs  and  Excise \nManagement Act, 2007; Customs Act, 2007; and the Excise Tax Act, 2007 on 2 February 2008, \nmarked the completion of Tonga's tax reform program. This program was first introduced in \nDecember 2002 with the introduction of the Revenue Services Administration Act. The first tax \nrevenue changes were introduced in April 2005 with the introduction of a consumption tax. \n \n11.  The latest reforms, aimed at improving compliance, see a move toward self-assessment \nof tax returns. Online filing for tax returns is expected to be effective beginning in FY2010. The \nnext step is web-based tax payments, but this development is dependent on the automated \nelectronic transactions of the banking system. Discussions are continuing between NRBT and \nthe  Revenue  Services  Department  on  the  possibility  of  extending  internet  banking  to  tax \npayment. This facility would improve the security of taxpayer\u2019s payments and reduce the need \nfor revenue services staff to be involved in handling cash. Custom administration reform of entry \nforms will be more efficient and accurate with the introduction of a new computerized custom \nmanagement system, which went online in July 2009. Customs are also acquiring new security \nx-ray machines to combat smuggling and improve compliance. \n \n12.  Step 7: Protect expenditure on services for the most vulnerable. Support for the \ndisadvantaged provided by public expenditure is difficult to assess because of a shortage of \npoverty analysis. Only a general tracking of expenditures is available with little use of benefit \nanalysis  and  feedback  of  analysis  of  subsequent  expenditure  allocations.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  increased  expenditure  on  essential  social  services\u2014the  FY2010  budget \nincreases the allocation for health by 28% and for education by 5.7%\u2014and is empowering \nregional and village communities by granting discretionary decision-making powers over local \naffairs. \n \n ", "64  Appendix 7 \n13.  The Government, through the introduction of the National Strategic Planning Framework, \naims to ensure all regions have the same economic and social opportunities, and contribute \nmore to national prosperity. The framework looks to build up economic activity throughout \nTonga by promoting skills, enterprise, and innovation. However, targeted regional interventions \nare needed to promote more balanced growth and social inclusion. The Government has set \naside T$1 million for development projects in the Niuas for FY2010. \n \n14.  Step 8: Secure external financial support, where needed and affordable. Tonga has \nidentified  some  external  financing  needed  for  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  that  minimizes \npressures on inflation and the balance of payments. It has secured grant commitments from \nAustralia and New Zealand, and is engaging with the European Community and the World Bank \nGroup. \n \n15.  The underlying budget deficit\u2014around 10% of GDP\u2014will be reduced through grants \nincluding the proposed ADB program grant. The overall cash deficit arising from the rebuilding \nof Nuku'alofa and associated public works is funded through external concessionary loans. \n \n16.  Step 9: Pursue quick-win structural initiatives. Tonga is undertaking an extensive \nstructural reform program. The Government has commenced a number of important structural \nreform measures geared to improve productivity performance, boost the medium-term economic \ngrowth rate, and help the economy reemerge stronger from the crisis. Commercial law reform to \nstrengthen  the  business  environment  is  well  advanced  and  requires  completion.  Likewise, \nefforts to improve access to finance through a reformed collateral framework and enhance \nfinancial services are progressing and need to be continued. The Government has also taken \npublic service reform measures to establish the institutional framework for a more performance-\noriented public service. Further work on strengthening and setting a good foundation for public \nfinancial management is undertaken in the FY2010 budget. \n \n17.  The Government has embarked on an ambitious reform program to privatize or improve \nperformance, and reduce the drain on public sector finances. However, returns on investment \nare low (albeit higher than state-owned enterprise returns in the Fiji Islands and Samoa), and \naccess to public funds provides less of an incentive to be efficient, which serves to leave little \nopportunity for private sector activities. \n \n18.  Step 10: Provide targeted support to the vulnerable. Limited targeted support is \nprovided to the vulnerable. Currently, an important provision is preferential access for outer \nislanders to the temporary seasonal worker scheme operated by New Zealand. New programs \ntargeting the vulnerable will take time for design and implementation. The Government has \nrequested ADB assistance in strengthening the resilience of the vulnerable through (i) social \nimpact analysis; (ii) identification and assessment of targeted rapid response measures such as \ncash for work and cash transfer programs; (iii) piloting of targeted social protection programs; \n(iv)  support  for  nongovernment  organization  activities  to  protect  the  vulnerable;  and  \n(v) monitoring and evaluation of the impact of such activities. \n \n19.  The prospects for microfinance appear promising. A community development program is \nbeing developed for implementation in the short and medium term. \n \nB.  Actions Best Avoided \n \n20.  Too large a fiscal expansion. Budgetary discipline will be controlled through careful \nmonitoring  of  expenditure,  including  capital  expenditure.  The  Government  has  tended  to \n ", "    Appendix 7  65 \nmanage its fiscal accounts prudently. The response to the crisis, however, includes a modest \nfiscal expansion in FY2010, which represents a marked change in the fiscal stance. It will be \nimplemented through an expansion in overall spending and a substantial increase in capital \nworks that will be financed through grant and loan financing.  \n \n21.  As set out in the forward estimates of the FY2010 budget, the fiscal expansion must be \nquickly restrained as economic conditions improve. \n \n22.  Excessive  government  pay  increases.  An  increase  in  public  sector  wages  and \nsalaries was approved and will become effective in FY2010. The raise is associated with public \nservice reform measures that are designed to translate into budgetary savings and productivity \ngains in the public service in the medium term. The wage increase was planned and negotiated \nas part of the public service reform process prior to the crisis. Positive compensating budgetary \nbenefits and efficiency gains are associated with the pay award. However, pressures are likely \nto grow in the lead-up to the 2011 election, and restraint needs to be prudently exercised and \nfiscal discipline imposed.  \n \n23.  Subsidies for business. The Government currently has no plans to expand subsidies \nto business. \n \n24.  Cuts to essential public services. The budgets for health and education have come \nunder pressure due to the need to meet wage increase commitments made in 2005, as these \nministries are the largest employers. The Government is increasing fiscal allocations in the \nFY2010 budget to education by 5.7%, health services by 23%, and social security and welfare \nby  more  than  42%  to  support  the  wage  increases.  This  increase  minimizes  the  need  to \nreallocate from service provision to wages and salaries. The appropriate remuneration of staff is \na government policy intended to support the provision of high-quality health and education \nservices in the medium term.  \n \n25.  Labor-intensive approaches to public works that are too costly. A new initiative will \noutsource road maintenance to the private sector, creating jobs in a cost-effective manner. This \nwill help improve national roads, increase productivity of road maintenance expenditure, and \nenhance local skills. Design work is complete, with ADB support, as part of the government's \nlarger public sector reform process, which seeks to harness the efficiency gains derived from \nemploying private sector solutions. Road maintenance contracts, properly structured, are an \nideal means of employing local labor and contracting with local suppliers. \n \n26.  Borrowing when unaffordable. The reduction in the budget deficit will be financed \nprimarily through grants. The reconstruction of Nuku'alofa is being funded through a loan from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, signed in 2007, under concessional terms. Once the full loan \ndrawdown has occurred, external debt will amount to slightly more than 40% of GDP, which is \nabove the 30% threshold for external debt to GDP set by the International Monetary Fund. \nHowever,  a  number  of  mutually  reinforcing  efforts\u2014including  extensive  structural  reform \nmeasures\u2014are under way to ensure debt returns to sustainable levels in the medium term. \n \n27.  Structural initiatives that cost jobs. No such initiatives are planned. While the public \nenterprise rationalization program may result in the restructuring or sale of public enterprises, \nevery effort will be made to avoid redundancies at this stage. \n \n28.  Reform  programs  that  lack  broad  support.  The  structural  portion  of  the  reform \nprogram has been widely consulted and publicized. Details have appeared in the local media \n ", "66  Appendix 7 \nand the initiatives have the strong support of the Chamber of Commerce. However, the need for \nreform needs to be communicated on an ongoing basis, and benefits that are expected to flow \nfrom this. \n \n ", "    Appendix 8  67   \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n \nA.  Major Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n \n1.  The formulation and delivery of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy and the program in general, and the global economic crisis response in particular, has \nbeen coordinated and aligned with other development partners, including with Australia, the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  the  European  Commission,  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n(through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) and Article IV missions), \nJapan, New Zealand, and the World Bank. This process was assisted by quarterly government-\ncoordinated and -led development partner teleconferences, which bring together resident and \nnonresident development partners.  \n \n2.  ADB-supported  analysis  in  the  Pacific  Islands  Economic  Report1 and  Private  Sector \nAssessment2 has contributed to policy dialogue, clearer division of interventions, and moving to \njoint advocacy among the development partners.  \n \n3.  These factors provide a strong basis for close coordination in response to the crisis. In \naddition to ADB, other development partners involved by the Government in the crisis response \ninclude Australia in the areas of infrastructure development, social sectors, and public sector \nreform; the People's Republic of China, the European Commission, and Japan in infrastructure \ndevelopment;  the  International  Finance  Corporation  in  private  sector  development;  the \nInternational Monetary Fund and PFTAC in economic statistics and surveillance; New Zealand \nin social sectors and planned business development services; and the World Bank in transport \nand  the  education  sector.

In terms of the proposed program, close coordination was undertaken especially in the \nareas of public financial management with Australia (which features high in the Tonga\u2013Australia \nPartnership for Development Agreement);3 and the International Monetary Fund and PFTAC in \nthe course of the Article IV surveillance mission and analytical work on economic and fiscal \npolicies.  \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n \n5.  Aid coordination is the responsibility of the Aid Management Division in the Ministry of \nFinance and National Planning. The institutional location of this unit acts to create strong links \nbetween development partner activities and the national development plan (now the National \nStrategic Planning Framework) and the annual budget. In addition to the quarterly development \npartner  teleconferences,  the  Government  holds  annual  development  partner  forums  in \nNuku'alofa, Tonga. These typically include discussions on aid harmonization, programming, and \npolicy issues. The forum provide an opportunity for the Government to present its development \nplans  and  priorities,  update  progress  in  implementation  of  existing  priorities,  and  seek \ndevelopment partner support for new initiatives.  \n \n6.  To  ensure  effective  coordination  of  support  from  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  and  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development,  a \nDeclaration between the Government of Tonga and Development Partners was formulated in \nconjunction with the Government during 2007 and jointly signed during the Pacific Islands \nForum leaders meeting in Tonga in late 2007. The declaration is guided by the principles of the \nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and sets out areas of joint agreement on a process of \neffective coordination in development cooperation work in Tonga. The declaration incorporates \nan action plan that defines concrete coordinated actions by the Government and development \npartners to improve aid effectiveness.  \n \n7.  The ADB\u2013World Bank Tonga country focal officer (funded by ADB under a regional TA),4 \njoint ADB\u2013World Bank Country Focal Office, provides an immediate point of contact for both \nGovernment  and  other  development  partners  in  Tonga  and  as  such  greatly  facilitates \nstrengthened development coordination. \n \nC.  Achievements and Issues  \n \n8.  Of the several broad achievements in aid coordination in Tonga, the highlights are the \nsigning of the Declaration between the Government of Tonga and Development Partners and \nthe regularity of government-led development partner meetings.  \n \n9.  More specifically, preparation of the program was undertaken in close consultation with \nthe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  within  the  country  and  at  headquarters.  Similarly  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  were  consulted  and  kept \ninformed of national program development. Broader regional dialogue on appropriate responses \nto the crisis, which included the Australian Agency for International Development, the European \nUnion, the International Monetary Fund and PFTAC, the New Zealand Agency for International \nDevelopment, and the World Bank, was used to consult and keep partners informed of the \npreparation of the Tonga program. \n                                                 \n3  In particular, the program's policy matrix in the area of public financial management is aligned with the Tonga\u2013\nAustralia Partnership for Development to facilitate coordinated or joint dialogue and monitoring in this area. \n4  ADB. 2009.

Recommendations  \n \n11.  The  program  includes  a  public  communications  element  that  is  intended  to  build \nawareness, understanding, and ownership of the economic recovery support program within \nTonga. Ensuring the timely development and implementation of this component will act to \nstrengthen aid coordination.  \n \n12.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Tongan economy is relatively undiversified, which makes it vulnerable to the global economic crisis. The heavy \nreliance on remittances and tourism reduces the short-term prospects for robust economic growth. The response to \nthe impact of the crisis requires extraordinary measures by the government, chiefly in fiscal policy and management, \nsupported by fiscal, social, and, to some extent, monetary policy. In April 2009, the cabinet approved a fiscal stimulus \napproach, primarily through accelerating investment in infrastructure to help offset the adverse effects of the crisis. \nThe crisis response is in line with the new National Strategic Planning Framework, which aims at sustained equitable \neconomic growth in Tonga by focusing on a number of outcomes that are directly linked to the proposed program, \nincluding the priority areas of (i) community development, (ii) private sector growth, and (iii) improved provision and \nmaintenance of infrastructure; as well as the enabling themes for the public sector: (i) making government smaller \nand  more  efficient,  (ii)  strengthening  public  enterprise  governance  and  performance,  and  (iii)  improving  the \neffectiveness of revenue collection. The proposed program is consistent with ADB\u2019s 2007\u20132012 country partnership \nstrategy for Tonga, ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy, ADB's Strategy 2020a, and ADB's current efforts to assist developing \nmember countries address the impact of the crisis. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nWhile recent hard data on poverty and hardship is not currently available (a new household income and expenditure \nsurvey is under way), the subdued economic conditions, combined with the significant decline in remittances, will \nlikely translate into higher unemployment and increased hardship for the poor and vulnerable. The lack of formal \nsocial protection systems will compound the impacts on the poor and vulnerable, although subsistence farming offers \nsome relief. Weak revenue performance could also place significant pressure on government expenditure programs. \nThis in turn has the potential to add to pressure on the most vulnerable members of the community arising from an \neasing in labor demand and the high cost of living. In-depth analysis of the social impacts of the crisis is needed, with \na view to designing, piloting, and implementing appropriate social protection measures. \n \nAlthough Tonga\u2019s social indicators are the best in the Pacific region, about 25% of the population has incomes that \nare below the basic needs poverty line. The Government is reforming service delivery to better meet the needs of the \npopulation through improved governance and service delivery of public enterprises and more explicit accounting of \ncommunity service obligation. While these measures should improve basic services in roads, wharfs, electricity, \nwater provision, and interisland transport, the impact on the poorer members of the community will need to be \nmonitored. The Government is also increasing fiscal allocations on education and health spending through the \nprovision of more teachers and health professionals. Policy reforms that result in higher sustainable long-term growth \nwill have a positive impact on poverty reduction. However, ongoing poverty monitoring through surveys and data \ngathering will be needed to ensure that these measures are benefiting the poor. Feedback from this analysis will \nallow necessary changes in the design of community service obligations and ensure better targeting of safety nets to \nprovide access for the poorest Tongans to improved basic services. \n \n2. Design Features \nThe program will provide fiscal resources to the Government to respond to the crisis by supporting structural reform \nfor medium-term growth in competitiveness, and protecting the vulnerable through enabling social expenditures. In \nterms of social protection, the Government has undertaken to at least maintain the core expenditure in social sectors \nto protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of the crisis. In particular, the Government is committed to maintain \ncore social expenditure in the health and education sectors during FY2010\u2013FY2011, including expenditure for \nnurses, rural clinics, and primary education, as in FY2009. The Government will commission an expenditure tracking \nsystem for health and education. The Government will also introduce and implement a new community development \nprogram, empowering district and town offices to implement programs to boost youth and female employment while \nimproving public services. The Government will maintain if not increase its expenditure in relation to strengthening \ncommunity development and related budget allocations in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets. To enhance financial \ninclusion, especially in remote areas, the Tonga Development Bank is assessing options for providing rural and \n ", "    Appendix 10  73 \nmicrofinance products and services.  \n \nIn addition, the program provides an anchor for a proposed regional project, for financing by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR), designed to strengthen the resilience of the vulnerable through social impact analysis, \nidentify and assess targeted rapid response measures such as cash for work and cash transfer programs, pilot \ntargeted social protection programs, support nongovernment organizations\u2019 activities to protect the vulnerable, and \nmonitor and evaluate the impact of such activities. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The impact of the program on increased social service budget allocations as well as better service \ndelivery should provide benefits to the Tongan economy and the Tongan people. The reform program will raise the \nsustainable growth rate of the Tongan economy in a way that will help those at the lower end of the income scale. It \nwill help finance the protection of critical core social expenditure. No negative social impacts are expected. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations on the proposed program, and in particular the associated reform components especially in public \nenterprise and structural reform, were carried out with key stakeholders including Government, private sector \norganizations, and the development community. Comprehensive consultations were undertaken in relation to the \nstructural reform component. In particular, ADB\u2019s 2008 private sector assessment for Tonga was widely consulted, \nprepared in cooperation with the Tongan Chamber of Commerce, publicly launched by the Prime Minister, and \npublished under ADB\u2019s private sector assessment series. Various stakeholder consultations were held and strong \nengagement established with public enterprises during the course of successive technical assistance projects \npromoting the reform of public enterprises. Stakeholder consultations, both publicly and in smaller target groups, \nhave been held on the reform of the legal business environment and the personal property securities reform. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  \n  Information sharing   Consultation   Collaborative decision making   Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nConsultations during program implementation will be ongoing, particularly under the various program components.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. While hard data is not available, some evidence indicates that women are particularly exposed to \nthe impact of the crisis, as they are often overrepresented in lower-paid jobs in most sectors of the economy, in \nparticular handicraft production, which forms the basis for a significant part of the remittance flows. In addition, \nwomen suffering from domestic abuse make up one of the most vulnerable sections of the population. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan   Other actions/measures   No action/measure \nThe program will include a social impact analysis and promote the design of social protection measures and pilot \nprograms. Given the high exposure to vulnerability for women in relation to the economic crisis, the analysis and \nensuing programs are expected to benefit women.  \n \nThe social protection measures undertaken as part of the program will have a positive impact on women as they will \nbenefit from protected social government expenditure, and community development programs that will help boost \nyouth and female employment.  \n \nThe legal reform components of the structural reform package should improve women\u2019s access to commercial \nactivities  by  simplifying  procedures  for  women\u2019s  groups  to  incorporate  companies.  The  amendments  to  the \nCompanies Act will allow women to incorporate companies quickly and inexpensively without the need for expensive \nlegal advice. The simple procedures provided under the amendment will allow women to file returns and an \nexpensive company secretary will no longer be needed as this office is removed under the amendment. The current \nhigh transaction costs, which are having a negative effect on the incorporation of companies by women, will be \nreduced significantly as soon as the new act is passed and the registry is operating. A component of the planned \n ", "74    Appendix 10 \n \nimplementation program will be targeted to women\u2019s businesses and women\u2019s community groups. This will include \ndeveloping materials, training women, and developing advisory capacity within the registry to assist women who wish \nto form and operate companies in Tonga. In addition, the proposed secured transactions bill will provide women with \ngreater opportunity to borrow against a range of personal assets, which currently is either not possible legally or \nprohibitive because of transaction costs. This may include shop inventory, handicraft goods, and tapa cloth. \n \n \nIII.
