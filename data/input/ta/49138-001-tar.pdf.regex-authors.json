INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  finance  ministers  endorsed  the \nestablishment of the APEC Financial Regulators Training Initiative (FRTI) in 1998, in order to \nbuild expertise of staff in financial supervisory and regulatory authorities in Asia and the Pacific \nand thereby enhance the stability of the region\u2019s financial sector.1 The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has served as FRTI secretariat since its inception and has provided technical assistance \n(TA) support. Three phases of the initiative have been implemented: phase 1 during 1998\u2013\n2000, 2  phase  2  during  2000\u20132010, 3  and  phase  3  during  2011\u20132015; 4  they  produced \nstrengthened  partnerships  with  regional  training  institutions  and  financial  institutions  from \ndeveloped economies,5 and an improved website. \n \n2.  This TA is closely linked to the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,6 especially the \ntheme of regional cooperation and integration, as the TA aims to strengthen the capacity of \nfinancial supervisory and regulatory authorities in Asia and the Pacific through the conduct of \ntraining programs under the initiative. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The 2008 global financial crisis was triggered in part by reckless mortgage lending \npractices by banks and improper derivatives trading based on these poor-quality underlying \nmortgage assets; it serves as a reminder of the importance of strong prudential standards, \nsupervision, and regulation to enhance financial stability.  \n \n4.  The global economy continues to struggle with the aftermath of the global financial crisis. \nGlobal interest rates remain low, and the search by investors for higher yields has resulted in \nrisk-taking  behavior  and  expedited  cross-border  movement  of  funds.  There  has  been \nconsiderable volatility in emerging financial markets, as exemplified by the second quarter of \n2013 when large funds, concerned with the possible tapering of quantitative easing, retreated \nfrom emerging economies. In addition, low interest rates have caused housing prices in many \nAsian and Pacific economies to rise dramatically, requiring financial supervisors to address \nmarket volatilities and their potential impacts by designing and implementing appropriate rules \nand regulations. \n                                                \n1 The member economies of APEC are Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; the People\u2019s Republic of China; \nHong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; \nPeru; the Philippines; the Russian Federation; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam. \n2 ADB. 1997.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 June 2015.  \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The region also faces emerging development challenges and issues that go beyond the \naftermath  of  the  global  financial  crisis;  challenges  for  financial  markets  include  recent \ninnovations in information and communication technology (ICT). Regulators find it difficult to \nkeep pace with technological change. While ICT advances have clear benefits to end users and \nconsumers, and for the overall efficiency of the banking sector and financial markets, rapid ICT \nevolution is producing new business models that are altering traditional financial industries, and \nrequire timely regulatory and supervisory responses to ensure investor and consumer protection.   \n \n6.  Addressing these challenges requires transparent policies and governance, along with \nwell-trained  financial  supervisors  and  regulators  in  order  to  enable  implementation  of \ninternational standards in the financial sector.8 Many ADB developing member countries (DMCs) \nhave committed to implementing core principles for banking and securities regulation, including \nthose developed by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organization of \nSecurities Commissions. \n \n7.  DMCs are developing more sophisticated forms of finance and risk management, and \nthere is a growing need for financial regulatory agencies in Asia and the Pacific to be equipped \nwith advanced technical skills and up-to-date knowledge to regulate and supervise financial \nmarkets in a way that protects investors and ensures financial stability. \n \n8.  ADB has provided much-needed TA to support the national commitments and related \ncapacity building requirements of DMC economies. APEC FRTI is one of the longest-running \ntraining initiatives endorsed by the APEC Finance Ministers Meeting, and by virtue of a cost-\nsharing mechanism among stakeholders, has been relatively cost effective. It is also demand-\ndriven,  with  seminar  topics    identified  through  surveys  and  meetings  among  APEC  FRTI \nmember  economies,  with  (i)  an  APEC  FRTI  member  institution  hosting  a  seminar  that  is \nparticularly relevant to its economy, and financing seminar costs (e.g., venue rental); (ii) other \nparticipating  economies  meeting  the  travel  expenses  (airfare,  accommodation  and  other \nallowances) of their staff participants; and (iii) ADB facilitating seminar programs finalization, \nand meeting the cost of engaging resource speakers and some administrative functions.  \n \n9.  APEC FRTI has two advisory groups: one is composed of senior banking supervisory \nrepresentatives and one of senior securities regulators. Advisory groups meet annually, and are \nvital in (i) determining annual seminar topics and host institutions, (ii) reviewing the seminar \nevaluations from participants, and (iii) providing guidance and technical support to APEC FRTI.  \n \n10.  Demand from DMCs for this advanced technical training has been strong. During 2001\u2013\n2014, APEC FRTI conducted 123 seminars, with 5,062 participants. APEC FRTI also provides \ncapacity-building  assistance  to  host  government  financial  regulatory  agencies. 9 These \n                                                \n8  The Group of Twenty (G20) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 \nmajor economies, founded in 1999 with the aim of studying, reviewing, and promoting high-level discussion on the \npromotion of international financial stability. The G20\u2019s financial regulatory reform agenda in 2014 focuses on four \ncore areas that address the causes of the crisis: (i) build resilient financial institutions, (ii) end too-big-to-fail, (iii) \naddress shadow banking risks, and (iv) make derivatives markets safer. \n9 For instance, the Mongolian government\u2019s newly promulgated Law on Investment Funds became effective in \nJanuary 2014, while other policy reforms were made to financial markets. APEC FRTI extended support to the \nFinancial Regulatory Commission of Mongolia and conducted a seminar on \u201cRegulation and Supervision of \nInvestment Funds\u201d in September 2014, as requested by Mongolia. In a second example, a liquidity risk crisis \noccurred in Bhutan; in response, APEC FRTI organized a seminar on \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d in Bhutan in \nDecember 2014. Through on-line training surveys, annual advisory group meetings, and requests by member \n ", "  3 \napproaches\u2014wherein advisory group members identify seminar topics and volunteer to host \nseminars\u2014ensure seminars conducted under APEC FRTI are demand-driven. In June 2014, a \nsurvey conducted by the APEC FRTI secretariat confirmed that all surveyed advisory group \nmembers desired that APEC FRTI continue.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  the  improved  financial  sector  supervision  and  regulation  in \nparticipating DMCs. The outcome will be the enhanced capacity of financial sector regulators \nand supervisors in participating DMCs. The TA will provide support to DMC financial regulatory \nagencies  through  capacity  development,  and  promote  regional  cooperation  and  integration \nthrough knowledge sharing and networking among participating DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Backed by strong demand and support from APEC member economies and APEC FRTI \nadvisory group members, the TA aims to undertake the following: \n(i)  Ensure sustainability. During the advisory group meeting in August 2014, the \nADB Secretariat proposed collecting seminar fees from participants, with fees \nwaived for participants from hosting economies and low-income countries. The \ncollected seminar fees will be deposited in an ADB account and be disbursed by \nthe Secretariat in accordance with instructions and guidance from advisory group \nmembers to ensure the program sustainable.10  \n(ii)  Incorporate cross-cutting topics into training program. Advancement of ICT \ncan enhance the efficiency of financial markets, and its rapid evolution is creating \nnew  types  of  financial  products  and  businesses,  including  online  or  crowd \nfunding and shadow banking business. These can threaten traditional financial \nindustries with unequal competition, because some supervision and regulations \ncannot keep pace with these advancements and new products. These topics will \nbe incorporated into training programs or as part of the annual conference.  \n(iii)  Expand  the  program  to  include  insurance  topics  and  regulators.  Some \nfinancial issues involve the banking, securities, and insurance sectors, and there \nis a need for insurance regulators to join the APEC FRTI program as advisory \ngroup members. Moreover, the rapid pace of change in the financial sector and \nincreasing number of investment products with insurance components means \ninsurance sector regulation is a cross-cutting topic. Inclusion of insurance issues \nin the APEC FRTI program will provide a more holistic, integrated approach for \nDMC staff to understand financial sector development. \n(iv)  Assess seminar outcome and impact. To assess capacity enhancement of \nfinancial sector regulators and supervisors in participating DMCs, the Secretariat \nwill request feedback from participants 6 months after the end of seminar.  \n(v)  Share seminar materials. Under the TA, APEC FRTI seminar materials will be \nuploaded to ADB\u2019s internal websites, such as that of the Finance Sector Group, \n                                                                                                                                                       \neconomies, APEC FRTI is able to identify the training needs of its members and develop training programs that \nclosely meet DMC needs by strengthening banking sectors and deepening the financial markets of DMCs. \n10 To facilitate the collection of seminar fees, the implementing office of the proposed TA will coordinate with relevant \ndepartments\u2014Office of Administrative Services, Controller\u2019s Department, and Treasury Department\u2014to use ADB\u2019s \npayment gateway system. This will be activated by Q1 2016. Written agreements will be prepared and executed \nprior to commencing collection of seminar fees. \n ", "4   \nfor  staff  reference  in  order  to  maximize  the  utility  of  seminar  materials  and \nefficacy of knowledge sharing. \n(vi)  Upgrade the initiative website. The TA will upgrade the website, improve the \nlayout  and  functionality  for  effective  dissemination  of  FRTI  seminars,  and \nenhance features (e.g., provide a simplified seminar registration process). It will \nalso provide participants with secure access to seminar materials and possibly \nwith chat rooms for trainees to exchange information and consolidate networks.   \n \n13.  Outputs will include the following:  \n(i)  Output 1: Partnerships among the technical assistance stakeholders. To \nconduct  seminars,  APEC  FRTI  has  partnered  with  different  international \nagencies (footnote 5) and financial regulatory authorities to invite experts as \nresource speakers.11 To incorporate insurance-related topics, APEC FRTI will \npartner  with  the  International  Association  of  Insurance  Supervisors,  among \nothers, to secure appropriate resource speakers. The TA aims to deliver at least \neight seminars per year hosted by government institutions; at least four seminars \nwill  be  supported  by  regional  and/or  international  institutions  through  the \nprovision of experts. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Knowledge-sharing  activities  conducted.  Seminars  conducted \nunder  APEC  FRTI  are  conceptualized  during  advisory  group  meetings,  with \nprograms finalized in coordination with the host institutions. This process ensures \nseminars  meet  member  demands,  and  that  they  do  not  duplicate  seminars \nconducted by other institutions or development partners. The TA aims to conduct \nat least one advisory group meeting for members per year, with an average \nattendance of 35 participants in each seminar. \n(iii)  Output  3:  Knowledge  products  produced  and  developed:  At  least  five \nsummary notes of selected seminar topics will be produced, the APEC FRTI \nbrochure  updated  and finalized,  and  the  APEC  FRTI  website  upgraded  and \nsystems maintained.12  \n \n14.  Major risks are that the (i) DMCs will not agree to meet the fee payment; (ii) training \nprograms are not supported, either by a failure of development partners to provide resource \nspeakers or participants not attending; and (iii) local counterparts have limited capacity to host \ntraining programs. To mitigate these risks, there will be close coordination and monitoring \namong ADB, the advisory group members, and the international institutions and agencies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $675,000, of which $225,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $450,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.13 The cost will cover the \nremuneration and travel expenses of consultants and resource persons, seminars, the website, \nand other miscellaneous expenses. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                \n11 Authorities include the Securities Commission Malaysia; Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank of the \nPhilippines); Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand); International Monetary Fund Singapore Regional Training \nInstitute; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority; Dubai Financial Services Authority; Financial Supervisory \nService (Republic of Korea); Securities and Futures Bureau (Taipei,China); Securities and Futures Commission \n(Hong Kong, China); Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (the deposit insurance system of Malaysia); and \nFinancial Supervisory Commission (Cook Islands). \n12 Each summary note uploaded in the website was downloaded at least 30 times. \n13 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be the  executing  agency for  this TA.  The Office  of the  Director General, \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department will be the TA supervising unit. The \ndepartment  will  coordinate  closely  with  ADB  operational  units  (regional  departments  and \nresident  mission  offices)  to  ensure  the  benefits  of  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  development \noperations are optimized. The project will be implemented over 29 months, beginning in August \n2015 until its targeted completion on 31 December 2017. \n \n17.   TA activities will be implemented with the help of international and national consultants \nand  resource  persons.  ADB  will  serve  as  the  FRTI  secretariat.  The  two  advisory  groups, \ncomprising  bank  supervisors  and  securities  regulators  from  FRTI  member  economies,  will \nprovide  overall  guidance  and  technical  support  to  steer  implementation.  The  TA  will  be \nmonitored  through  consultant  progress  reports  and  ongoing  surveys.  Good  practices  and \nlessons will be (i) disseminated in advisory group meetings and at the APEC senior finance \nofficials\u2019 meetings, and (ii) published on the FRTI website and in newsletters to members. \n \n18.   The TA will require about 12 person-months of international consulting services, 45 \nperson-months of national consulting services, and 10 person-months of resource persons\u2019 \nparticipation. Consultants and resource persons will be recruited individually, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).14 The scope \nof work and outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. To implement the \nTA successfully, a team of Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department staff will \nmanage consultants and consolidate their outputs.  \n \n19.   Purchasing of equipment (i.e., computer hardware and software) will be undertaken by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) \nand in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and Office of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be \ndisposed of in compliance with the project administration instructions on administering grant- \nfinanced TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $675,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing  the  Capacity  of  the  Asian  Financial  Sector  through  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation Financial Regulators Training Initiative, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14  Based on ADB\u2019s experience as the FRTI secretariat, hiring individual consultants is more effective and flexible \nthan engaging a firm. The project team leader (international staff) and the secretariat will have (i) flexibility in the \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring of FRTI activities; and (ii) more opportunity to have direct dealings with \nand accommodate pressing demands of the FRTI advisory groups to which ADB directly reports. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact(s) the Project is Aligned with \nFinancial sector supervision and regulation in participating DMCs improved \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapacity of financial  By 2016, on average, 88%  Progress and annual  High turnover among \nsector regulators and  of the participants to claim  reports of consultants  regulators\u2019 personnel \nsupervisors in  that they will likely use the    can effectively diminish \nparticipating DMCs  knowledge they gained  Seminar evaluation  the impact of the \nenhanced  from the seminar topics  survey from participants  program. \n \n(2014 baseline: 84%) \nParticipants\u2019 feedback 6 \nmonths after seminar \nOutputs       \n1.
