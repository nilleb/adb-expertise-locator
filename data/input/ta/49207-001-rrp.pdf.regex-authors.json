I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nequity investment of the Indian rupee equivalent of up to $51,000,000, and (ii) a proposed loan \nof up to $100,000,000 to RBL Bank (RBL) for the Supporting Financial Inclusion Project in \nIndia.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of 7.8% from \nFY2005 to FY2014, helping the country to reduce poverty from 37.2% in FY2005 to 21.9% in \nFY2012.2 Although India weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, growth slackened \nduring FY2012\u2013FY2014 as a result of (i) tighter monetary policy to counter persistently high \ninflation; (ii) the lack of consensus on some policy and regulatory issues; and (iii) the adverse \neffects of a decrease in global demand.3 Since mid-2014 growth has rebounded, helped by \nincreased political certainty, several policy actions, lower commodity (oil and non-oil) prices, \nimproved business and consumer confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. GDP growth \nwas 7.3% for FY2015.  According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates based on \nrecently revised data, India\u2019s GDP growth is expected to increase to 8.2% in FY2016, benefiting \nfrom  lower  inflation  (the  result  of  supportive  monetary  policy),  and  increased  capital \nexpenditure.4  \n \n3.  Finance  sector  overview. The Indian finance sector is still developing, with banks \nplaying the dominant role in providing funding. As of FY2014, India\u2019s finance sector comprised \n94 commercial banks and 57 regional rural banks. Of the domestic banks, 26 were government-\nowned banks and 20 private sector banks operating in India.  Performance of the private sector \nbanks has generally exceeded that of  most government- owned banks, with exceptions such as \nState Bank of India,  in terms of growth, asset quality, efficiency, and profitability, and they now \naccount for 19% of credit. After growing at an average rate of 17.2% between FY2009\u2013FY2014, \naverage  credit  growth  for  the  banking  sector  slowed  to  13.8%  in  FY2014  due  to  the \nmacroeconomic slowdown. Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking sector, as per \nthe definition of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), weakened from 2.4% in FY2010 to 4.6% in \nFY2015.5 Furthermore,  loans  undergoing  restructuring  increased  from  3.3%  to  6.5%  from \nFY2010 to FY2015.6 The minimum total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for FY2015 stands at \n9.63% of risk weighted assets and is expected to increase to 11.5% in a phased manner by \nFY2019 due to Basel III implementation. \n \n4.  Notwithstanding the size of the banking sector, access to finance in India remains a key \nissue  with  47%  of  people  being  unbanked. 7  Many  private  sector  banks\u2019  activities  are \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2014.

Manila. \n5  NPAs for public sector banks are almost double those of private banks. \n6  Changes in the RBI\u2019s definition of NPAs will include new restructured assets, as NPAs have put upward pressure \non the sector\u2019s NPA data. Restructured assets refer to loans that are consolidated and the loan terms have been \nchanged to avoid default by the borrower(s). \n7  The percentage of unbanked people in India has declined from 65% in 2011.

Access to \ncredit is even more limited, with fewer than 14% of borrowers accessing credit through formal \nchannels.8 Key reasons for financial exclusion, from the demand side, include low literacy levels, \nlack of awareness of banking products, low irregular incomes and cultural obstacles. From the \nsupply side, common constraints often include outreach in low density areas and low income \npopulations, bank charges and unsuitable regulations and products.9 Women in particular have \ndifficulties accessing credit due to a number of factors, including lower income and lack of \nownership of land and other forms of collateral needed to obtain credit.10 The Government of \nIndia is encouraging banks to support financial inclusion to address access to finance issues. In \nAugust, 2014, the government launched an important initiative aimed at financial inclusion, the \nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme (Prime Minister's People Money Scheme), which has \nfar exceeded its target of opening 100 million accounts for poor families and as of November 18, \n2015, has opened more than 192.7 million new accounts.11 The directed lending norms of the \nRBI require that every domestic commercial bank and every foreign bank with at least 20 \nbranches extend an aggregate of 40% of the adjusted net bank credit of the preceding year to \nthe PSL sectors.  \n \n5.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise sector. Foremost amongst underbanked \nsegments  is  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs).  According  to  the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), there are 29.8 million MSMEs in India operating across \nall industries.12 These businesses employ more than 69 million people. They include 2.2 million \nenterprises led by women and 15.4 million rural enterprises, many of which focus on primary \nagriculture activities. MSMEs account for 45% of Indian industrial output and 40% of exports. \nLack of adequate access to finance has been one of the key constraints to growth. Financial \ninstitutions  traditionally  have  limited  exposure  to  MSME  sector  versus  larger  commercial \nenterprises, due to a higher risk perception, MSMEs\u2019 limited access to immovable collateral, and \nnonstandardized documentation. The IFC estimates that the MSME sector\u2019s total requirement \nfor financing is approximately $650 billion, of which $433 billion is for debt financing. \n \n6.  The rural and agriculture sectors are important to Micro, small, medium-sized \nenterprises. Rural and agriculture lending for food production and processing plays a key role \nfor MSMEs. Approximately 850 million people live in rural India, representing 70% of the total \npopulation.13 This group heavily depends on income from micro and small businesses, such as \nsmall-scale agriculture and fisheries. However, agriculture contributes to just 17% of GDP (as of \nFY2014)14 due to low productivity and profitability. Lack of credit availability is a primary reason \nfor low investment in the agriculture sector as it received only 11%\u201312% of institutional credit \n                                                \n8  World Bank. 2014.

Investment rationale. Given the continued need to address access to finance issues for \nmany customer segments and support the government\u2019s financial inclusion initiatives, ADB has \nsought  to  identify  financial  institution  partners  that  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  reach \nunderbanked segments on a profitable and sustainable basis. RBL has been a partner of ADB \nas a local currency lender in the Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s Microfinance Risk \nParticipation and Guarantee Program since 2012.16 RBL is one of the few private sector banks \nthat has consistently achieved PSL targets working with lower income individuals and MSMEs, \nincluding agri-based customers (more than 18% of RBL\u2019s total credit went to the agriculture \nsector  in  FY2014).  RBL\u2019s  understanding  of  its  customer  segments  and  comprehensive \nunderwriting systems have enabled it to maintain strong asset quality and profitability while \nachieving above industry average growth rates. It plans to continue on this growth trajectory and \nprovide  access  to  banking  and  financial  services  to  5  million  underserved  households  by \nFY2020. Through a three-pronged approach of providing equity for growth, long-tenor debt, and \ntechnical assistance (TA), which will be approved separately, ADB will support the continued \nexpansion of a bank that has profitably built financial inclusion as a core business.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  RBL is a private sector bank established in 1943 to cater to MSMEs in the states of \nMaharashtra and Karnataka. Following a 2010 change in management, which implemented a \nsuccessful turnaround strategy, the bank has emerged as one of the faster-growing banks in \nIndia with total assets of $4.4 billion, a loan portfolio at $2.3 billion, and a deposit base of $2.8 \nbillion as of the end of FY2015. It now operates 183 branches across 13 Indian states serving \nover 1.3 million customers (as of FY2015). To support its growth plans by strengthening Tier I \ncapital, RBL has filed a draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to \nundertake an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares (subject to regulatory approvals).  The \nbank also plans to raise capital through a pre-IPO private placement. \n \n9.  RBL offers a comprehensive range of banking products and services customized to \ncater to the needs of its clients, with a focus on PSL to support underserved or unbanked \ncustomers.  The  bank\u2019s  business  segments  consist  of  corporate  and  institutional  banking, \ncommercial banking, branch and business banking, agribusiness banking, and development \nbanking and financial inclusion (DB&FI). As of FY2015, RBL\u2019s PSL book constituted 47.86% of \nits adjusted net bank credit, of which 19.41% was lent to the agriculture sector.  \n \n10.  RBL is now well placed to start its next growth phase by expanding its agribusiness \nbanking  and  DB&FI  segments.  RBL\u2019s  growth  strategy  is  to  reach  more  regions  with  low \npenetration and new client segments via (i) branch network expansion; (ii) strengthening of its \nnetwork of exclusive business correspondents; and (iii) development of its technology platform \nthat supports innovative inclusive finance products, such as mobile banking and micro-ATMs \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.

RBL\u2019s strategy will be increasingly mapped to meet the needs of PSL segments. In the \nagribusiness banking segment, the bank\u2019s strategy is to cover the entire agricultural value chain \nand create a loyal customer base by offering a complete range of value-added products and \nservices. In the DB&FI segment, it will continue to partner with select business correspondents, \nexpand its reach, and provide last-mile delivery of its products and services in rural India \nthrough transaction points. RBL is also targeting women borrowers to try to achieve financial \ninclusion for women and progressive social change. Its plans include continued development of \nspecific products for women borrowers and financial literacy training. The bank will also expand \nits  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  portfolio  through  the  commercial  banking \nbusiness segment by focusing on industries that have good growth potential. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n12.  Ownership.  Under RBL\u2019s transformation plan of 2010\u20132015, the bank consolidated its \nshareholding and strengthened its capital base by raising high-quality institutional capital. RBL \nhas raised four rounds of equity funding since 2010 totaling $284 million with investments from \nreputed global institutions.  \n \n13.  Governance. Under the leadership of Vishwavir Ahuja, who became managing director \nand chief executive officer in 2010, RBL brought in a highly respected and experienced board of \ndirectors to strengthen governance. The managing director and chief executive officer is the \nonly executive director. The board consists of members with considerable professional expertise \nin banking, finance, agriculture, and other related fields. \n \n14.  Management.  The  transformation  process  of  RBL  started  with  the  recruitment  of \naccomplished professionals from the banking industry under the leadership of Vishwavir Ahuja, \nwho has more than 30 years of banking experience. Before joining RBL, Vishwavir Ahuja was \nchief executive officer of the Bank of America in India. RBL\u2019s senior executive management \nteam has a strong academic and professional background with a proven track record and \nexperience. RBL has several management committees running the daily operations of the bank \nwhich includes committees for assets and liabilities, and credit and operational risk. \n \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n15.  The proposed ADB assistance consists of (i) an equity investment of the Indian rupee \nequivalent of up to $51 million; and (ii) a 5-year loan of up to $100 million. ADB also expects to \n                                                \n17 Business correspondents are facilitators, including MFIs or social organizations employed by banks on a revenue \nshare model, that service people at the bottom of the income pyramid. This is a business model used by certain \nbanks in India to efficiently reach underserved segments and to fulfill PSL requirements. RBL has entered into \nexclusive  partnership  agreements  with  eight  business  correspondents.  It  carefully  assesses  its  business \ncorrespondents based on their established track record and strong local relationships.   \n \n \n   ", " \nprovide a capacity building TA grant of up to $800,000.18  The TA will build the bank\u2019s risk \nmanagement  and  information  technology  capabilities,  specifically  in  its  development  of  a \ncustomized loan origination system for agribusiness banking and DB&FI. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s equity investment will be in the form of new shares subscribed via a pre-IPO \nprivate placement to be undertaken prior to RBL\u2019s stock exchange listing. It is anticipated that \nsome existing international investors in RBL may also seek to increase their shareholdings \nthrough the private placement.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB.19 RBL will provide ADB with financial \nreports at pre-determined regular intervals and as requested, including (i) unaudited financial \nstatements  on  a  quarterly  basis;  (ii)  audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis;  (iii) \ncompliance certificates for financial covenants; (iv) reporting on the MSME, microfinance, and \nsmall farmer loan portfolios; (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed \nbetween ADB and RBL; and (vi) annual implementation status of its environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) reports. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n18.  ADB is expected to provide the following value additions: \n(i)  Support of financial inclusion. ADB\u2019s funding will help RBL continue to grow and \nreach underserved customer segments in India. Additional funding will also enable it \nto meet and exceed PSL targets\u2014a key government objective as well as expand its \noperations  to  some  of  the  lesser  developed  states  in  India  including  Oddhisa, \nChhattisgarh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. By supporting the capitalization of one of \nIndia\u2019s  leading  private  banks  focused  on  financial  inclusion  and  providing  debt \nfinancing, ADB has a unique opportunity to support PSL initiatives and increase \nfinancial services in rural India. \n(ii)  Catalyze capital as a strategic shareholder.  \n(iii)  Provide access to longer tenor debt.  \nSupport women borrowers. ADB\u2019s assistance will also help to improve access to \nfinance for women through a gender action plan. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n19.  Impact. The project will broaden access to finance for farmers and MSMEs. \n \n20.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved financial intermediation to farmers and MSMEs, \nwith a specific focus on women borrowers, which will help boost investment in rural India, \nincreasing farm income and employment.  \n \n21.  Output. The output will be increased financial capacity of RBL to service MSMEs, \nfarmers, and microfinance borrowers, with specific targets for women borrowers within these \n                                                \n18 The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which (i) $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); and (ii) $200,000 will be provided by RBL. \n19 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n \n ", "6   \n \n \n \nsegments. The project should contribute to the expansion of the finance sector\u2019s footprint in \nIndia\u2019s low-income rural economy to include underbanked and unbanked segments. In addition, \nADB\u2019s TA will help RBL to reach the underserved. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n  \n22.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  and  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  ADB  aims  to \nstrengthen  the  finance  sector  by  supporting  the  development  of  financial  infrastructure, \ninstitutions, and products and services; and by promoting inclusive growth.20 The investment will \nassist RBL in its efforts to (i) expand its offerings to the low-income population across rural and \nsemi-urban India; and (ii) provide long-term finance to deepen financial service availability to \nMSMEs and farmers, thus also supporting ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u2013\n2017.21 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020.22 It is designed to have a gender equity theme and will directly \nprovide and target financial services to women farmers and women MSMEs. The project will \ntarget women beneficiaries as borrowers and investors, and will therefore receive direct gender \nbenefits. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n23.  The project is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s loan will support RBL\u2019s agribusiness and MSME \nportfolio, which is likely to have only a small number of minimal to limited adverse environmental \nimpacts or risks (generally site-specific, largely reversible, and addressable through readily \navailable prevention and mitigation measures). On the other hand, as ADB\u2019s equity funding will \nsupport the overall growth of RBL which may include RBL\u2019s corporate loans that may be \nconsidered  environmental  category  A  and  that  may  have  potential  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  operations  of  RBL  are  not  expected  to  trigger  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts,  including  acquisition  of  land  that  will  cause  economic  or  physical \ndisplacement (including that of indigenous peoples). In the unlikely event of any involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples impacts, the ESMS will provide guidance on matters \npertaining to due diligence and corrective actions. RBL will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list, ensure that investments using ADB funds will comply with applicable national laws \nand regulations, comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and establish and \nmaintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before funding the proposed loan or equity. \nRBL has an existing ESMS that will be enhanced to satisfy ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements prior to ADB funding. These enhancements will include developing appropriate \nenvironmental  and  social  review  procedures  and  providing  training  to  facilitate  ESMS \nimplementation by MFIs and NBFIs; incorporating relevant provisions for subproject review by \nADB  for  category  A  subprojects  and  ensuring  that  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements are met; incorporating ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activity list in RBL\u2019s exclusion \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2008.

RBL will also submit an annual environmental and social performance report on \nthe status of its ESMS implementation.23 Information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \n24.  The project is designed as having \u201cgender equity theme\u201d. RBL supports (i) rural women \norganized in credit self-help groups (SHG), and (ii) micro and small- sized business households \nacross India by providing working capital to augment farm productivity and income opportunities. \nThe bank will use business correspondents as intermediaries or directly service women SHGs. \nThe SHG model ensures adequate participation of women in the decision making and reception \nof  essential  financial  literacy  training.  RBL  will  assign  capable  staff  to  monitor  the \nimplementation of the gender action plan and reflect into the annual environmental and social \nperformance monitoring report. RBL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. RBL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such \nlaws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n25.  RBL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
