THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Dushanbe Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n \n2.  The project will support Tajikistan in (i) rehabilitating and expanding climate-resilient water \nsupply and sanitation (WSS) infrastructure, pilot testing the establishment of district metering \nareas (DMAs) for nonrevenue water (NRW) management in selected districts of Dushanbe city \nand rehabilitation of the south sewage collector, benefitting 352,000 people;1 and (ii) developing \na business model for the State Unitary Enterprise Dushanbevodokanal (DVK) to improve the \nsustainability  of  operations,  including  an  accountability  and  incentive  mechanism  with  a \nperformance benchmarking matrix and smart management system. The project will pilot test a \nbehavior change component for raising public awareness on water usage and conservation and \nthe benefits of smart meters. This is the first urban sector project of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in Tajikistan, demonstrating efficient network management with potential for scaling up \ncitywide. It is listed in the ADB country operations business plan for Tajikistan, 2018\u20132020.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.   Dushanbe, the capital city and economic center of Tajikistan, had an official population of \n820,000 in 2016 but almost 1 million unofficially because of increased migration from rural areas \nand a significant number of returning migrants. Urban migration has added stress to the aging \nurban infrastructure and led to unplanned spatial expansion of the city, especially in the southeast, \nwith low density patterns.3 This has caused environmental degradation, resulting in high coping \ncosts, poor livability for citizens, and limited economic growth prospects.4   \n   \n4.  Core problem. The WSS systems in Dushanbe, built under the former Soviet Union, have \ndeteriorated because of age, lack of continued capital investment, and inadequate operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Most of the population of Dushanbe has access to piped water supplied by \nDVK, except for the new development areas in the southeast of the city. The water system is \ncharacterized by intermittent operations (4\u20138 hours per day), high NRW, and low water pressure \nand energy efficiency. Disrupted supply conditions create daily shocks that damage the network \nand risks of wastewater infiltration. The expanding urban areas are not connected to the water \nand sewerage systems. Lack of public understanding of water conservation, combined with low \ntariffs, has led to uncontrolled water consumption and wastage. Water consumption is high at 330 \n                                                \n1  About one-third of the city\u2019s population (352,000 people) live in the 5,700-hectare catchment area of the south \nsewage collector.  \n2  ADB. 2017.

Presentation by J. Parkinson. Zurich. 26 September. The average per capita economic impact of \ninadequate WSS service is about $35.00 per person/year, of which $25.00 per person/year is the coping cost for not \nimproving water supply, about $3.00 per person/year is related to waterborne diseases attributable to poor water \nsupply, $4.00 per person/year is attributable to poor sanitation, and $2.00 per person/year is related to contamination \nof water resources resulting from poor sanitation; and M.

The incidence of ascariasis in Shohmansur district increased from 34 \ncases in 2015 to 53 in 2016.6   \n \n5.  Inadequate and inefficient water supply and sanitation. The WSS system is described \nbelow:   \n(i)  Infrastructure. Water in Dushanbe is supplied from four water treatment plants \n(WTPs) in each quadrant of the city, with a total capacity of 520,000 cubic meters \nper day (m3/d). Napornaya and Samotechnaya WTPs  in the north (capacity of \n204,000 m3/d) use surface water sourced from the River Varzob 16 kilometers (km) \nupstream from the city. The groundwater treatment plant in the southeast of the \ncity (Kafernigan I) was commissioned in 1972 and the Southwest WTP was built \nin 1977. Both rely on groundwater abstraction. The centralized water supply \nsystem was built in 1932 and extended in the 1970s.   \n(ii)  Operation and maintenance. The water supply coverage in Dushanbe is 83%, \nbut its service quality and reliability are poor. NRW is expected to be more than \n60% because of high physical losses from the deteriorated infrastructure, high \ncommercial losses, and poor operational management.7 High levels of NRW lead \nto low levels of business efficiency. About 187,000 customers are registered, of \nwhich only 76,500 are metered\u2014limiting the cost recovery, user charges, and \nsustainability of operations.  \n(iii)  Institutional  management.  DVK  cannot  cover  its  operating  or  capital  costs \nbecause of low tariffs, inefficient operations, and high debt servicing of loans in \nforeign  currency.  Skilled  technical  staff  are  lacking  in  DVK  for  technical, \nprocurement, financial management, and utility management because of high \nturnover. DVK needs adequate business planning and a competitive incentive \nstructure to become viable. \n(iv)  Finance.  Investment  is  inadequate  for  capital  and  operational  expenditure \nbecause of limited municipal revenue, with nominal tariffs, limited metering, low \nbilling and collection efficiency, and high costs caused by operating inefficiencies. \nEnergy cost is a significant part of operational expenditure. Until October 2016, \ntariffs were calculated per person based on an estimated household size of four \npersons, not volumetric consumption, leading to excessive water consumption and \nwastage. The 2017 combined tariff for 1.0 m3 of water supply and wastewater is \nlow at $0.05-$0.07 per household and $0.57 for commercial organizations.8 The \nimplementation of the tariff adjustments and universal metering are essential for \nthe financial sustainability of DVK. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016.

NRW has three \ncomponents: (i) physical losses\u2013leakage from all parts of the system and overflows at the utility\u2019s reservoirs; \n(ii) commercial losses\u2014under-registration of customer meters, data handling errors, and theft of water in various \nforms; and (iii) unbilled authorized consumption\u2014water used by the utility for operational purposes, water used for \nfirefighting, and water provided free to certain consumer groups.   \n8  Decree of the Department for Anti-Monopoly Policy No. 52 dated 29 June 2016.  \n \n ", "3 \n6.  Ongoing work. The World Bank is supporting investments in the north of the city, \nincluding improvement of the Samotechnaya WTP with a design capacity of 280,000 m3/d.9 The \nWorld Bank project will introduce rapid gravity filters and re-chlorination systems to improve water \nquality. It has supported the installation of bulk meters and 76,500 household meters. A tariff study \nis ongoing. ADB will continue coordination with the World Bank.  \n \n7.  Sanitation.  Dushanbe  has  one  sewerage  network  and  wastewater  treatment  plant \n(WWTP) built in the 1970s, which has undergone upgrades with the replacement of pumping units \nand rehabilitation of sedimentation tanks. The sewerage system is separate, without storm water \nentry, and operates entirely under gravity conditions. However, it has numerous overflows to \nwater bodies and agricultural land because of a design flaw in the south sewage collector. DVK \nestimates that 70% of the population is connected to the sewerage system and the remainder \nuses  septic  tanks.  Wastewater  undergoes  only  basic  physical  treatment  through  primary \nsettlement. Although the WWTP has both physical and biological facilities, only the physical \nfacilities are working.10  \n \n8.  Climate change vulnerability. Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in Central \nAsia and the second least able to adapt (footnote 4). Its water security score fell from 2013 to \n2016 (footnote 5), raising the need for efficient use of water. Climate change adaptation needs \nfor the water supply sector include reducing surface water reliance by diversifying sources to \nimprove water security, NRW reduction, and increased efficiency in O&M.    \n \n9.  Alignment with country strategy. The project is aligned with the National Development \nStrategy 2030, which highlights improving the quality of life in urban areas through rehabilitation \nof WSS systems and expansion of network, water supply reforms, and strengthening institutional \ndevelopment toward  efficient,  transparent management  and financial  control  by  introducing \nmodern information technology.11 It also complies with the legal framework for the water sector \nbased on the Water Code (2000, amended 2012) and the draft Law on Drinking Water and \nSanitation. The draft law, expected to be approved by Parliament in 2018, foresees budgetary \nand user tariffs as financing sources and proposes privileges and benefits for providers of drinking \nwater and sanitation systems. The law provides guarantees on the safety and quality of water \nsupply and the protection of water sources through the establishment of sanitary protection zones. \nThe project advances the ADB Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 and the concept of livable \ncities\u2014an  operational  priority  of  the  ADB  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  and \nStrategy 2030.12  \n   \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. The following features provide ADB value addition:  \n(i)  Project design and innovation. The ADB intervention initiated innovative design \nfeatures  such  as  (a)  pilot  testing  a  systematic  DMA  approach  for  NRW \nmanagement; (b) installing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for \nnew  network  management  practices,  including  active  leak  detection;  and \n                                                \n9  World Bank. 2017.

ADB is introducing a holistic approach for ensuring \nthe sustainability of the investments and operations through the business plan for \nDVK. The project will introduce international best practice through an incentive and \naccountability mechanism, with a performance benchmarking matrix. To ensure \nproject ownership and the retention of skilled staff after the project, staff for the \nproject implementation unit will be deployed by DVK and provided with an incentive \nstructure.   \n(iii)  Operational efficiency and financial sustainability. ADB is enabling integration \nof the customer database with the billing, collection, accounting, and reporting \ncomputerized  systems.  The  provision  of  upgraded  software  and  training  will \nimprove the billing and collection efficiency of DVK and reduce NRW, as unbilled \nconsumption will decrease. \n(iv)  Behavior change and consumer orientation. The project includes a behavior \nchange and communication plan, aimed at demand-side management, to promote \nthe  new  service  level  and  its  impact  on  health,  efficient  water  usage,  and \nawareness of the benefits of metering and billing among stakeholders. The project \nwill strengthen DVK communications and the media team\u2019s capacity to manage \ncustomer relations, improve service standards, establish communication protocol, \nand expand the customer response units to bolster customer trust. \n(v)  Climate change resilience. The project will enhance climate change resilience \nthrough  flood  risk  management,  protection  of  groundwater  well  fields,  and \nimproved drainage. It will enable an overall decrease in the volume of water \nabstracted  from  groundwater  aquifers.  It  will  also  reduce  energy  demand, \ncontributing to climate mitigation and reducing the coping cost incurred by citizens.  \n \n11.  Lessons learned. Based on experience from completed ADB-funded projects, lessons \nadopted for the project include (i) aligning the project preparation and implementation schedule \nwith the government\u2019s approval procedures, (ii) minimizing the number of procurement packages, \nand  (iii) using  advance  action  for  the  detailed  engineering  design  to  ensure  procurement \nreadiness. The project design incorporates these lessons with a limited number of procurement \npackages and adequate project implementation support. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: quality of life, health, urban resilience, \nand economic growth in Dushanbe improved and universal access to safe and affordable drinking \nwater by 2030. The project will have the following outcome: inclusive and sustainable access to \nsafe and resilient WSS services in Dushanbe city improved.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Climate-resilient water supply and sanitation infrastructure rehabilitated \nand expanded.

The project will be under Ministry of Finance oversight. The executing agency will be the \nState Executive Authority of Dushanbe City, and the implementing agency will be DVK, under \nwhich a project implementation unit (PIG) was established on 19 July 2018 through decree No. \n452.  The  implementing  agency,  supported  by    PIG  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \ncoordination and management. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2018  \u0336September 2024  \nEstimated completion date   30 September 2024 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 March 2025 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Finance \n(ii)   Executing agency  State Executive Authority of Dushanbe City \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  State Unitary Enterprise Dushanbevodokanal \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project implementation group, 9 staff \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  4 contracts  $38.0 million \nRequest for quotations  4 contracts  $0.2 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  106 person-months  $3.6 million \n(international)  (international) \n246 person-months \n(national) \nDirect contracting (national)  116 person-months  $292,000 \nIndividual consultant selection  9 person-months  $100,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting will be allowed for procurement of civil works and \nadvance contracting  recruitment of consultants.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The  project  outputs  are  aligned  with  the  priorities  accorded  by  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  and  the  stakeholders.  Some  100,000  people  will  benefit  from  the \n ", "7 \nimproved  water  supply  and  350,000  people  will  benefit  from  the  sanitation  investment. \nShohmansur district was selected for establishing DMAs through the application of criteria such \nas population density, incidence of waterborne diseases, typology of housing, social equity, and \nclimate resilience. The civil works packages under output 1 are technically feasible; they use \noptimum design solutions and technology for undertaking the civil works and O&M, including \nSCADA  and  smart  meters,  which  DVK  can  manage.  The  design  standards  reflect  the \nenvironmental objectives, meet government climate resilience criteria, and will not result in \noverdesign. Output 2 will ensure the long-term sustainability of the project outputs through \ninstitutional strengthening and establishing the DVK business model.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n21.  Economic viability. An economic analysis was conducted in accordance with relevant \nADB guidelines for WSS projects.15 Project benefits were estimated from (i) incremental water \nconsumption calculated using the willingness to pay of the targeted residential and business \nconsumers; (ii) the cost savings from non-incremental water consumption with the switch to piped \nwater from alternative water sources; and (iii) public health benefits from the potential reduction \nin the incidence of waterborne diseases in the project areas. The resulting base-case economic \ninternal rate of return is 12.6%, which exceeds the ADB minimum discount rate of 9.0% and \nconfirms the economic viability of the project. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project will \nremain economically robust under the following scenarios: (i) a 10% increase in investment cost; \n(ii) a 10% increase in operation and maintenance costs; (iii) a 10% decline in benefits; (iv) a \ncombination of scenarios (i), (ii), and (iii); and (v) a delay in subproject benefits by 1 year.  \n \n22.   A financial analysis was undertaken by estimating cash flows over the project life to \nensure the project will generate sufficient revenues to cover the full O&M cost.16 The analysis \nconcluded that DVK has insufficient financial capacity for capital investments for improved water \nand sanitation infrastructure. DVK\u2019s financial position has deteriorated by more than 60% from \n2008 to 2018 because of the devaluation of the local currency. Its foreign currency denominated \ndebts from previous loans have become a significant burden for DVK as well as a source of further \ncurrency risk. The Ministry of Finance will transfer the project grant funds to DVK\u2019s balance sheet \nas equity. Increased billing and tariff collection efficiency has been identified as a priority for \ngenerating the required revenues to improve DVK\u2019s financial position. To achieve financial \nsustainability, DVK needs to (i) increase tariffs by 16.2% per year for the next 3 years and at the \nrate of inflation thereafter; and (ii) reduce NRW from the 64% in 2017 to 48% by 2025 for the \nentire city, through a reduction in unbilled authorized consumption and other losses. The expected \ntariff growth based on the ongoing tariff study by the World Bank is within the limits found by the \nDushanbe residents willingness-to-pay study. A cash-flow model confirms that, with the proposed  \ntariff adjustments (reviewed annually) and improved operational efficiency, DVK would have the \nfinancial capacity to meet full O&M costs to sustain infrastructure and service delivery.17 Grant \ncovenants to ensure financial sustainability have been agreed with the government.   \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial management. The financial management risk is substantial because of DVK\u2019s \nexisting financing structure with (i) foreign exchange risk from repaying USD denominated loans; \n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); ADB. 2017.

Manila.   \n16 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Cash Flow Model (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2).   \n \n ", "8 \n(ii) negative equity, and (iii) insufficient knowledge and understanding of DVK staff on ADB grant \ndisbursement guidelines and procedures. While DVK has an adequate financial management \nsystem and policies in place, it will require some adjustments to incorporate project-specific \naccounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting. ADB rating is consistent with the World Bank \nrating.18 The auditors of DVK identified DVK\u2019s ability to service its debt as a concern, The \nsubstantial financial management risk will be mitigated through a financial management action \nplan that includes (i) transferring the project grant funds to DVK\u2019s balance sheet as equity to \nachieve positive equity in the first year of grant effectiveness and a sustainable debt\u2013equity ratio \nof 0.55 by 2024;19 (ii) establishing target debt service coverage and debtors\u2019 days ratios as \nfinancial  covenants  for  DVK;20 (iii) providing  training  and  consultant  support  to  DVK;  and                \n(iv) providing upgraded software to enable seamless integration of its accounting system with the \ncustomer database and to increase revenues by reducing unbilled consumption, which is a \nsignificant part of the high NRW. DVK has been implementing World Bank-funded projects, which \nuse grant disbursement procedures similar to ADB procedures.  \n \n24.  Procurement.  The  procurement  capacity  risk  is  substantial  because  of  IA\u2019s  limited \ncapacity to manage procurement functions efficiently. There is significant procurement lead time \nand implementation delays. A procurement risk assessment and management plan has been \nprepared.  All  the  procurement  (including  consulting  services  and  advance  actions)  will  be \nundertaken in full conformity with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement should be in accordance with the procurement plan, which covers all procurement \nactivity for the project, including threshold and review procedures, goods, works, and consulting \nservice contract packages, as indicated in the PAM (footnote 14).  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  discussed  with  the \ngovernment, the State Executive Authority of Dushanbe City, and DVK. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive and will contribute to better \nliving conditions, overall welfare, and health of the target beneficiaries. The south sewage \ncollector covers 5,700 hectares catchment, benefitting about 352,000 people. The project will \ndirectly benefit 100,000 residents in Shohmanshur and Rudaki districts by improving access to \nsafe water supply, and 38,000 of these residents in six DMAs will have 24/7 water supply. The \nproject will create temporary employment opportunities during implementation for local people, \nespecially the poor and vulnerable groups. It will benefit women, as it will reduce the time they \nspend fetching, storing, and treating water; and managing the consequences of poor quality \nwater, such as illness in the family. ADB will allocate resources for professional trainings and the \nrecruitment of social and gender specialists to ensure that poverty, gender, and other social \nissues receive priority; and that women, the poor, and socially excluded groups are engaged in \nall project stages. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been prepared, with \nmeasures to address the social impacts and enhance the distribution of project benefits.21  \n                                                \n18 World  Bank.  2018.

The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has \nbeen prepared. The gender analysis indicated that women in the project areas are generally more \ndisadvantaged than men. The project has ensured that women participate and benefit equally \nfrom  the  interventions  through  (i)  participating  in  decision  making;  (ii)  increased  economic \nempowerment; (iii) enhancing their participation in technical training and access to information; \n(iv) improved gender mainstreaming capacity of the executing and implementing agencies in \nproject  management;  and  (v)  including  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement system, monitoring and evaluation indicators, and regular project reporting. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.22   \n \n29.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) and associated \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared for the project, in accordance with \nthe ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009).23 The IEE established that the project is not \nanticipated to cause significant irreversible adverse environment impacts but is expected to have \nshort-term localized construction-related potential impacts, including noise, dust, and exhaust \nemissions from equipment and construction vehicles; waste management; occupational health \nand safety; community health and safety; and construction traffic. During operations, potential \nimpacts are related to the limited local capacity to maintain the functionality of the components, \nwith positive impacts expected from the rehabilitation works. The EMP provides appropriate \nmitigation measures to be incorporated in each contract. The implementing agency will ensure \nthe project complies with the environmental covenants. The implementing agency will recruit a \nfull-time environmental specialist in the PIG, to monitor the implementation of the EMP and site-\nspecific management plans. On-the-job training for institutional strengthening and environmental \nsafeguards compliance will be conducted by the project management, design  and supervision \nconsultants.  \n   \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  census  carried  out  during  project \npreparation identified about 44 affected households with 288 household members. Out of the \n44 affected households, 17 households with 98 members will experience a severe impact on their \nlivelihood, and no household was found to belong to vulnerable groups. The project will affect two \nbusinesses and 12 business renters. No relocation is expected as a result of this project. A land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARP) has been prepared to mitigate the associated impacts \nand losses, with an entitlement matrix. In addition, a land acquisition and resettlement framework \nhas been prepared in accordance with the SPS and relevant national legislation to guide the \nimplementing  agency  in  preparing  and  updating  LARPs  in  case  unanticipated  impacts  are \nidentified during detailed design and project implementation.  \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples, as defined in the SPS, are in \nthe project area. \n \n32.  Stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted through formal  and  informal focus group \ndiscussions, wide consultations with communities, targeted workshop consultations, individual \nconsultations with displaced persons during the census, and a detailed measurement survey from \n                                                \n22 ADB.
