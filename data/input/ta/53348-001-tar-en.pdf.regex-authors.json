INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support selected developing \nmember countries (DMCs)1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in (i) elaborating, evaluating, \nand promoting innovative ways to scale up climate change adaptation interventions through \nagroecological landscape restoration;2 and (ii) strengthening the capacity of communities to \nrestore and manage their climate-resilient landscapes for food and nutrition security. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20303 and  will  support  the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s Climate Change Operational Framework, 2017\u20132030,4 which identifies \nincreased climate resilience of agriculture and natural resources sectors as one of the priorities. \nThe TA is also included in the 2020 Management-approved results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Nearly 50% of Asia\u2019s inhabitants still live in rural areas and depend on land and land-\nbased ecosystem services for their livelihoods. However, agricultural and forest lands that the \nrural poor depend on have been degraded because of unsustainable land management practices \nsuch as deforestation, biodiversity loss, soil nutrient mining, and cultivation on steep slopes. This \nis causing serious economic, social, and environmental problems, such as increased vulnerability \nto climate change impacts. Land degradation affects the rural population's livelihoods by reducing \nthe productivity of land resources and increasing agricultural production costs. Degraded land \nalso undermines the resilience of natural systems, which in turn increases their vulnerability to \nclimate change. The degraded rural landscapes of DMCs therefore need to be restored to meet \nthe challenge of adapting to climate change as well as ensuring food and nutrition security for a \ngrowing population. \n \n4.  With the increasing realization of close links between land degradation and vulnerability \nto climate change, there are growing calls for greater recognition of the contribution of landscape \nrestoration to climate change adaptation. For example, restoring degraded agricultural land \nthrough  agroforestry  will  support  the  climate-resilient  livelihoods  of  poor  and  vulnerable \ncommunities by preventing soil erosion and maintaining soil fertility.6 Restoring forests also helps \nreduce the local impacts of climate-related hazards, such as landslides. Some studies suggest \nthat forest restoration could reduce the peak flows of small flood events and flood frequency at \n \n1  These are Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines. Other countries could be considered if resources \npermit. \n2  The practice of integrating agroecological principles into landscape restoration. Agroecology is defined as \u201can \nintegrated approach that simultaneously applies ecological and social concepts and principles to the design and \nmanagement of food and agricultural systems\u201d.

Agroforestry for Landscape Restoration: Exploring the Potential of Agroforestry to Enhance \nthe Sustainability and Resilience of Degraded Landscapes. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations. \n \n ", "2 \nsmall catchments. 7 Furthermore, landscape restoration complements the climate-proofing efforts \nof infrastructure investment. For example, restoring riparian forests in watersheds helps enhance \nthe climate resilience of hydropower and reservoir infrastructure by decreasing sedimentation.8 \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Special Report on Climate Change and Land \nacknowledges  the  role  that  landscape  restoration  can  play  in  climate  change  adaptation, \nmitigation, and sustainable development.9 \n \n5.  Although  ADB  has  implemented  projects  that  have  successfully  demonstrated  the \ndevelopment and environmental benefits of land restoration,10 more support is needed to help \nDMCs fully capture the opportunities that arise from investing in climate change adaptation \nthrough landscape restoration. There are also gaps in terms of systematically integrating climate \nchange risk management into the design of land restoration activities as well as planning and \nimplementing those interventions at the right scale, because of technical, socioeconomic, and \ninstitutional  barriers  including  limited  practical  experience  and  capacity  to  identify,  design, \nimplement and monitor landscape restoration projects. Investment for landscape restoration is \nalso constrained by limited capacity to use high-level and digital technologies that could overcome \nhistorical constraints on planning, implementing, and monitoring at scale. \n \n6.  More support is also needed to help DMCs embrace a land restoration approach that \noptimizes the resilience-building outcomes. For example, efforts to restore species-rich and \nclimate-resilient forests by using native tree species that are adapted to the local environment are \noften constrained by, among others, limited financial resources, knowledge and capacity to select, \npropagate and use right native tree species and to exercise silvicultural practices adapted to a \nchanging climate. Likewise, opportunities to introduce climate-resilient and biodiverse agricultural \nproduction systems into degraded lands through agroecological landscape restoration exist but \nare not fully realized because of gaps in stakeholders' knowledge and capacity. \n \n7.  The ADB-financed Climate Resilience and Green Growth in the Upper Marikina River \nBasin Protected Landscape TA project,11 which was implemented from 2012 to 2015, supported \ncapacity  development  to  integrate  climate  change  concerns  into  subnational  development \nplanning. This TA will build on the lessons learned to help further improve access to the climate \nchange  data  needed  to  formulate  effective  adaptation  measures,  particularly  nature-based \nsolutions for climate resilience; and will carry out targeted capacity development activities that \nenable stakeholders to design and implement climate actions. \n \n \n7  S.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: climate and disaster resilience built.12 The TA \nwill  have  the  following  outcome:  DMCs\u2019  capacity  to  scale  up  climate  change  adaptation \nstrengthened.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will support selected DMCs in (i) elaborating, evaluating, and promoting innovative \nways to scale up climate change adaptation interventions through agroecological landscape \nrestoration; and (ii) strengthening the capacity of communities to restore and manage their \nclimate-resilient landscapes for food and nutrition security through agroecology. The outcome of \nthe TA will be achieved by delivering the following outputs. \n \n10.  Output 1: Agroecological landscape restoration interventions promoted. The TA will \nsupport DMCs in undertaking analytical studies to inform the formulation of adaptation policies \nand the preparation of investments in climate change adaptation through the agroecological \nrestoration of degraded forests and agricultural lands. Using participatory approaches, the TA \nteam will help prepare at least three landscape level case studies across the DMCs where the TA \nwill be implemented. The studies will (i) identify priority landscapes and sites for restoration \ninterventions, such as watersheds and lands prone to erosion, floods, and droughts; (ii) assess \nclimate risk and map restoration opportunities; and (iii) conduct an economic analysis of the \nplanned restoration interventions. Potential restoration options to be assessed include tree \nplanting,  assisted  natural  regeneration,  agroforestry,  riparian  buffers,  slope  stabilization  by \nrevegetation, climate-smart agriculture, and integration of agroecological principles into farming \npractices. The TA team will (i) review issues and challenges of current land restoration and forest \nmanagement practices in a changing climate; and (ii) identify opportunities to improve the land \nmanagement  practices  to  promote  climate-resilient  and  biodiverse  forests  and  agricultural \nlandscapes. Opportunities and barriers to use native tree species for landscape restoration will \nbe analyzed. The TA team will also examine the cross-sector links of agroecological land-based \nadaptation interventions, such as the food-nutrition\u2013water\u2013energy security nexus, to develop \napproaches that maximize synergy and address potential trade-offs between relevant sectors. In \naddition, the TA team aims to demonstrate the application of high-level, digital technologies, such \nas remote sensing and drones, and strengthen the DMCs\u2019 capacity to use these technologies. \nOpportunities  to  establish  payment  for  ecosystem  services  and  other  innovative  financial \nmechanisms as well as to promote investment from private sector in sustainable land use and \nrestoration will be assessed as a measure to scale up agroecological landscape restoration for \nclimate resilience. The team will also assess measures to maximize the synergies between the \nadaptation benefits of landscape restoration and the mitigation benefits of reducing emissions \nfrom deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) as well as other forest carbon market \nmechanisms. The TA team will investigate sustainable agroforestry or land restoration business \nmodels and their enabling environments and will identify private companies that follow such \nmodels. The TA output will inform the preparation and implementation of DMCs\u2019 national and \nsubnational  adaptation  strategies  and  plans,  such  as  Nationally  Determined  Contributions \n(NDCs), and help integrate landscape restoration for climate-resilience into the design of ADB\u2019s \n \n12 ADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 3: Tackling Climate Change, Building Climate and Disaster \nResilience, and Enhancing Environmental Sustainability, 2019\u20132024. Manila. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \ninvestment projects. Finally, the TA will help provide strategic advice to ADB\u2019s new country \npartnership strategies for the participating DMCs on climate change adaptation and disaster risk \nmanagement based on the case studies. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Climate-resilient  agricultural  livelihoods  in  climate-vulnerable \ncommunities promoted. The TA will help strengthen the capacity of communities to restore and \nmanage climate-resilient landscapes for food and nutrition security through agroecology. Using \nparticipatory approaches, the TA team will carry out at least three community-level studies across \ntarget DMCs to promote community-based activities that support the poorest and most vulnerable \npeople, including women, through the integration of agroecological principles in land restoration \nand  management  practices  for  climate-resilience.  Participatory  approaches  may  include \nstakeholder analysis, participation plans, participatory surveys, and participatory monitoring and \nevaluation. The TA team will review and develop climate-resilience indicators and a matrix that \nshould be gender-sensitive and can be used to assess, monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness \nof land restoration and management actions in support of climate-resilient livelihoods. The TA \nteam will also Identify and carry out demonstration activities of community-level agroecological \nand gender-sensitive land restoration and management options for climate resilience. It will \nassess the economic costs and benefits, as well as the environmental benefits of the proposed \ninterventions, including their contribution to food-nutrition-water-energy security, climate change \nmitigation and biodiversity conservation. Among the options to be analyzed are agroecology, \ncommunity  forest  management,  establishment  of  community  tree  nurseries,  forest  fire \nmanagement, increased value-addition and value-chain development of agroforestry products, \nand enhanced access to agroclimatic information. The TA team will evaluate ways to improve \ncrop quality, increase value addition, and strengthen the market links for smallholder farmers so \nas to increase their income and encourage them to adopt agroecological practices. It will consider \nthe development and use of certification schemes, and access to forest carbon markets. The TA \nwill also deliver targeted training. In addition, the TA team will assess and document the local \nknowledge and practices that help communities cope with the impacts of climate-related hazards \nand climate change, and evaluate ways to improve them with modern technologies and innovative \nnature-based solutions. The capacity of stakeholders, such as extension agencies, research \ninstitutions, civil society organizations, farmer organizations, and the private sector, may be \nstrengthened to support farmers in adopting and implementing climate-resilient land-use practices. \nThe TA output will inform the actions of DMC governments to mainstream community-based \nclimate change adaptation and resilience building in their NDCs and climate adaptation plans. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge on climate-resilient agroecological landscape restoration \nprojects increased. The TA will foster knowledge co-creation and sharing and promote the \nincorporation of agroecological landscape restoration for climate resilience into the design of \nADB\u2019s investment projects in DMCs. The TA team will (i) study global, regional, and national good \npractices; (ii) document lessons and innovations tested through activities implemented for outputs \n1 and 2;  and (iii) organize national and subnational workshops as well as targeted events to \nenhance the capacity of institutions and communities, including women and other vulnerable \ngroups, and to exchange ideas and disseminate knowledge. A knowledge and communication \nstrategy will be developed during TA inception. The TA team will publish knowledge products, \nincluding digital online materials such as case studies, good practice guidance, working paper, \ntechnical notes, video clips, and blogs. It will also publish a limited number of copies of selected \nreports in English and the local language, as needed. These products will be disseminated \nthrough local and national workshops, and at high-level regional and international forums, such \nas United Nations conferences related to climate change, land degradation, forest, biodiversity, \nand sustainable development. \n \n ", "5 \nC.
