INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing Private Sector \nParticipation in Agriculture will design support measures to increase private sector participation \n(PSP) in Uzbekistan\u2019s agriculture sector. The TA will support (i) the preparation of a sector \ndiagnostic study to evaluate the potential for PSP in the agriculture sector, with a focus on \nsupporting  infrastructure,  including  irrigation;  (ii)  capacity-building  for  selected  government \nagencies, including the development of an awareness tool kit to help identify, appraise, implement, \nand manage PSP and public\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects; and (iii) the preparation of the \nconcept notes for two to three potential PSP and PPP projects, and other possible government \nsupport measures needed to boost PSP in the country\u2019s agriculture sector. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country operations business \nplan for Uzbekistan, 2021\u20132023.1 Supporting private sector development is a priority area of \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023.2 The TA will contribute to the \nachievement of Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, and 10,3and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n2030 operational priorities (OPs): OP1  on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, \nOP5 on promoting rural development and food security, and OP6 on strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Agriculture sector production is vital to Uzbekistan\u2019s food security, economic growth, and \nthe livelihood of its people. In 2020, agriculture generated 28% of the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct, provided employment to 27% of the labor force, and constituted 25% of the country\u2019s \nmerchandise exports.4 Out of 20.4 million hectares of agricultural land, 20.7% is irrigated. About \n85% of the irrigated land is cultivated by about 0.075 million large farms, while the remaining 15% \nis cultivated by about 4.9 million small farms and household plots.5 However, the sector\u2019s gross \noutput is below its full potential because of (i) inadequate irrigation, market, logistics, and road \n(farm to market) infrastructure; (ii) inefficient and fragmented value chains; and (iii) lack of support \nto farmers. \n \n4.  Much of the irrigation infrastructure in Uzbekistan is more than 30 years old and needs \nsignificant modernization. Low water user fees and poor recovery rates discourage investments \nto maintain existing irrigation infrastructure assets as well as new investments in future water \ndevelopment projects. The situation is expected to deteriorate with increasing aridity because of \nclimate change and continued use of conventional irrigation techniques.6 \n \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Uzbekistan\u2019s infrastructure for logistics and wholesale and retail markets is insufficient and \nlacks strategic national coordination. The lack of all-weather rural roads hampers access to \nlogistics hubs and implicitly results in price increases for agricultural products. \n \n6.  The agricultural value chain is characterized by weak linkages between value chain actors, \nas  well  as  insufficient  and  technologically  poor  logistics  and  storage  facilities  with  limited \nprocessing capacity. Public investments in agricultural research and development, extension \nservices, and agribusiness development have been negligible. Private sector investments have \nbeen limited. Farmers have limited access to advanced agricultural technologies, productive \nseeds, effective fertilizers and pesticides, and appropriate financial resources and insurance \nproducts. \n \n7.  Considerable additional investments are required to address these issues and support the \nsustainable development of the agriculture sector in Uzbekistan, including increases in public \nbudget allocations to the sector. \n \n8.  Provided with the right incentives, private sector investors and financiers can reduce the \nfinancing  gap  and  introduce  new  technologies  and  efficient  management  approaches.  The \ngovernment recognizes that if it does not create an enabling environment for PSP, Uzbekistan \nwill be unable to strategically maximize public investments to directly support the agriculture \nsector. \n \n9.  The government needs to develop a better understanding of how to engage private sector \nplayers for efficient service delivery. Prospective PSP and PPP projects need to originate from \npublic  investment  planning  underpinned  by  a  medium-  to  long-term  sector  strategy.  The \ngovernment needs to design and develop new projects that are sustainable from an engineering \nand environmental perspective, with more efficient operations and assets maintenance using PSP \nsolutions,  including  strengthening  linkages  between  agricultural  inputs,  production,  storage, \nprocessing,  marketing,  and  capital  investment.  Appropriate  institutional  arrangements  and \ncontractual frameworks must be designed and introduced to efficiently implement and manage \ncontracts. Most importantly, the right incentives, regulatory framework, and budgetary support \nmust be created so private investors, operators, farmers, public agencies, and other stakeholders \ncan work together on mutually beneficial and sustainable schemes. \n \n10.  Increased PSP is expected to contribute to sustainable agriculture sector development. A \ncomprehensive diagnostic study is needed to improve the understanding of the potential benefits \nand challenges of PSP and PPP projects in the agriculture sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: private sector development in the agriculture \nsector supported (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: enabling environment for \nPSP and PPP in the agriculture sector strengthened.7 \n \n \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Conditions for enabling PSP and PPP in the agriculture sector identified. \nOutput 1 will help the government improve the legal and institutional framework for PSP and PPP \nprojects in the agriculture sector. It will assess the environment, key constraints, opportunities, \nand capacity needs for PSP through a sector diagnostic study. This diagnostic study will be \nprepared in consultation with private sector stakeholders8 and development partners.9 It will \nassess the interest and perception of risk among private sector players\u2014including investors and \nfinanciers\u2014through market soundings10 to provide recommendations on key opportunities and \ninterventions to improve the PSP enabling environment. The diagnostic study will also assess \nclimate risks and adaptation actions in areas related to PSP development. \n \n13.  Output 2: Public sector specialists\u2019 knowledge in PSP and PPP enhanced. Output 2 \nwill enhance the capacity of government agencies to identify, appraise, implement, and manage \nPSP and PPP projects in the agriculture sector. Based on the findings of the diagnostic study, the \nTA will (i) develop an awareness tool kit to identify, appraise, implement, and manage agricultural \nPSP and PPP projects, including evaluation of environmental, climate change, and social risks; \nand (ii) conduct tailor-made sector-specific trainings with case studies in various aspects of PSP \nand PPP for at least 60 staff of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the Ministry of Water Resources \n(MWR), and provincial government authorities. Professionals from the private sector will be \nengaged as resource persons and trainers. \n \n14.  Output 3: Potential PSP and PPP projects identified. Output 3 will help the MOA and \nMWR identify feasible PSP and PPP agricultural projects for detailed appraisal and structuring. It \nwill prepare the concept notes (prefeasibility studies) for two to three potential PSP and PPP \nprojects, which will be approved by the MOA and MWR as a pipeline of bankable projects for \ndetailed appraisal and structuring with ADB support. The potential areas for PSP and PPP \ndevelopment  include  (i)  agricultural  value  chains;  (ii)  agricultural  research,  innovation,  and \ntechnology transfer; (iii) building, upgrading, and operation of irrigation, market, logistics, and rural \nroad infrastructure; and (iv) delivery of business development services to farmers and small \nenterprises or other financial support, insurance, or policy instruments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office space for TA \nconsultants,  counterpart  staff,  data  and  information  access,  facilitation  of  liaisons  with \nstakeholders, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The Uzbekistan Resident Mission of ADB\u2019s Central and West \nAsia Department will implement the TA in consultation with the Environment, Natural Resources \n \n8  Agribusiness firms, farmers, agricultural clusters, agricultural inputs suppliers, commercial banks, and wholesale and \nretail firms. \n9  The European Union, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Bank. \n10 Structured dialogues through meetings or written communication with private sector companies, investors, and \nfinanciers. \n \n ", "4 \nand Agriculture Division; the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division; and the \nClient Solutions Team of the department.
