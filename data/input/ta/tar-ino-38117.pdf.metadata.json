As requested by the Government of Indonesia (the Government) an advisory technical \nassistance  (ADTA)  for  public  health  and  nutrition1  in  the  amount  of  $500,000  has  been \nimplemented since September 2003. The purpose of the ADTA was to (i) design a model of \npublic-private partnerships in the nutrition sector, and (ii) prepare a project design for improved \nurban nutrition management in three cities2 in Indonesia. During ADTA implementation the need \nfor a comprehensive sector strategy for urban nutrition became apparent. The Government \nrequested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  additional  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nprepare the Urban Nutrition Project3 for six cities.4 The Project aims to help meet Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and target 4 (reduce \nprevalence of underweight children under 5 years of age). The scope of work, implementation \narrangements, financing arrangements, and time frame of this TA5 to prepare the Project were \ndiscussed with the Government during the final Review Mission for the ADTA undertaken in \nMay 2004. Appendix 1 provides the logical framework for the Project. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Recent data6 for Indonesia show that improvement in nutritional status has steadily \nslowed down over the last 10 years. Stunting or low height for age remains a problem for 33.8% \nof children, and wasting or low weight for height is estimated to occur in 11.4%. Urbanization \nexacerbates the transition toward sedentary lifestyles and high-fat diets that carry potential risk \nfactors for diet-related diseases. A unique issue emerging from this transition is the double \nburden of under- and overnutrition in the same household. In urban slum areas, nutritional \nsurveillance data suggest that undernutrition occurs in 22% of households with obese mothers. \nGiven that diet-related diseases are spreading rapidly among the urban poor and the fact that \ncurrent nutrition strategies are not appropriate to respond to over- and undernutrition, policymakers \nand health-care providers are increasingly under pressure to develop innovative nutrition strategies \nespecially for poor urban communities. \n \n3.  Existing nutrition policies and programs are based on the paradigm that malnutrition is \nprimarily caused by a lack of protein and energy due to insufficient food intake and supply, \nwhich affects largely the poor rural population. Nutrition issues in urban areas have been widely \nneglected so far. Nutrition interventions such as growth monitoring and dietary counseling \nlargely address the reduction of protein and energy deficiency and focus to a lesser extent on \ndietary quality, which is the key in reducing urban malnutrition problems. Such services are \nprovided in health centers and clinics, which prevent many of the urban poor to utilize such \nservices due to high opportunity costs. Indonesia has limited nutrition outreach or community-\nbased programs for nutrition education. In 2003, about 3% of the total health budget was spent \non  nutrition,  of  which  80%  was  allocated  to  distribution  of  complementary  feeding7  alone, \nleaving a limited budget for essential preventive nutrition and educational interventions. Under \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia on Public Health and Nutrition. Manila. TA \nimplementation was completed on 30 June 2004. \n2  Makassar, Medan, North Jakarta.  \n3  A project preparatory TA for preparing the Project was included by the Country Program Confirmation Mission in \nApril 2004, with an ensuing loan of $40 million scheduled for approval in 2005. \n4  Selection of cities will be finalized in consultation with Government taking into account ADB\u2019s criteria for limiting the \ngeographical scope of projects.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 30 May 2004. \n6  RAND. 2004. Indonesian Living Standards Before and After the Financial Crisis. Singapore.  \n7 The process of introducing semisolid foods into the diet of young children, in addition to continued breastfeeding, \nfrom 6 months of age. \n ", " 2  \ndecentralization, the Ministry of Health (MOH) established minimum service standards8 and \nguidelines on nutrition and food quality, and monitors the performance of districts and provinces, \nwhich are responsible for implementing nutrition programs. Given the limited technical and \nhuman resource capacity to plan and manage nutrition programs, current interventions are not \nadapted to local realities, and nutrition programs have not been adjusted to the specific needs of \nthe urban poor.  \n \n4.  The poorer the household the larger the proportion of income spent on food.9 In some \npoor areas of Jakarta, households spend about 70% of their income on food-related expenses. \nUnlike in rural areas, where food is prepared at home, the urban poor have to purchase \nprocessed food that is of inferior dietary quality. Results of the ADTA confirmed that urban poor \ncommunities do not necessarily face a shortage of food but have to survive on nutritionally \ninferior food, purchased from street vendors. Food vendors often use inadequate equipment \nand unsafe additives. While laws and regulations on food sanitation exist, compliance with them \nis  inadequate.  Improved  monitoring  systems  and  upgrading  of  local  food  laboratories  are \nrequired to increase food safety.  \n \n5.  Nutritional deficiencies of poor urban dwellers can be addressed through fortification of \nprocessed  foods  with  vitamins,  minerals,  and  calories.  Food  fortification  is  already  key  in \nmeeting Indonesia\u2019s national nutrition goals of reducing anemia and vitamin A and certain \nmineral  deficiencies.  Stronger  public-private  partnerships  are  required  to  go  beyond  iron \nfortification of wheat flour10 to, for instance, fortification of palm oil with vitamin A. Research \nindicates that food fortification programs are the most cost-effective interventions for addressing \nnutritional  deficiencies,  followed  by  education  for  dietary  behavioral  change.  Given  the \ncomplexity of urban malnutrition, additional public-private alliances beyond food fortification and \nfood safety must be explored.  \n6.  The World Bank funded the Iodine Deficiency Control Project in Indonesia, which was \ncompleted  in  2003.  The  World  Bank  recently  finalized  a  nutrition  sector  review,  which \nhighlighted the need for expanding food fortification and food supplementation as a key strategy \nin  fighting  micronutrient  deficiencies.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  has \nsupported various micronutrient initiatives such as salt iodization, iron fortification of wheat flour, \nas well as supplementary feeding programs and vitamin A distribution. The United States Agency \nfor International Development (USAID) is funding the distribution of wheat flour by the World \nFood Program (WFP) to poor rural and urban communities in selected areas. Most nutrition \nprograms in Indonesia focus on reducing rural malnutrition and, therefore, largely neglect the \ngrowing malnutrition among urban poor communities. Based on ADB\u2019s previous sector work,11 \nthe TA will help operationalize recommendations to reduce micronutrient deficiencies as part of \na new strategic public-private sector approach to tackle urban malnutrition.  \n \n                                                \n8 Minimum service standards for community nutrition include, among others, distribution of Vitamin A capsules to \nchildren under five years of age, distribution of iron tablets to pregnant women, supplementary feeding for infants of \npoor families and therapeutic feeding for children under five years. \n9  Vulnerability and poverty in urban areas differ significantly from those in rural areas in four distinct ways: (i) the \nurban poor live in a cash economy and purchase processed food rather than grow their own, (ii) livelihood \nopportunities are limited, (iii) informal safety nets to help people cope in times of shock are different, and (iv) \nenvironmental conditions can be harmful to the health. \n10 While iron fortification of wheat flour is already in place, regulatory mechanisms have to be established for quality \nassurance. \n11 ADB. 2001. Regional Initiative to Eliminate Micronutrient Malnutrition in Asia through Public-Private Partnership. \nManila; ADB 1998. Regional Study of Nutrition Trends, Policies, and Strategies in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. ", "      3\n7.  Nutritional status is a key indicator of poverty. Policies and programs to improve nutrition \noutcomes are an integral part of social and economic development. Nutrition transition demands \na shift from narrowly defined nutrition programs and policies toward multisectoral program \napproaches and alternative service delivery strategies that respond to the complexity of urban \nmalnutrition. Therefore, the Government has identified the reduction of urban malnutrition as \none  important  pillar  of  the  national  nutrition  strategy.  Given  the  effectiveness  of  improved \nnutrition as a means of reducing mortality, preventing forms of mental and physical retardation, \nand minimizing productivity losses,12 the development of new multisectoral strategies using \npublic-private  alliances,  which  address  dietary  quality,  food  safety,  food  fortification,  and \nbehavioral change, are required to prevent urban malnutrition and diet-related diseases.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The TA will help the Government identify and prepare a project in six cities, comprising \n(i) integrated nutrition programs for urban poor communities through public-private partnerships \nand  community-based  schemes;  (ii)  programs  and  policies  to  address  urban  malnutrition, \nespecially by strengthening and reinforcing food fortification and food safety; (iii) support for \ninstitutional and human resource capacity development of central Government and regional \ngovernments to plan and manage integrated urban nutrition programs; and (iv) provision of \nsocial infrastructure and equipment to implement urban nutrition programs. The objective of the \nProject is to implement an integrated nutrition program for the urban poor in selected cities. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  Based on the ADTA results, the TA will complete a comprehensive analysis of urban \nnutrition issues and subproject appraisal reports (SPARs) for six cities. Cities will be chosen \nbased on their fiscal capacity and demonstrated commitment to combat urban malnutrition. The \nTA team, in collaboration with the MOH technical team, will organize national and regional \nworkshops, involving all relevant stakeholders, to prepare SPARs and recommendations on \nurban nutrition strategies. \n  \n10.  In the selected cities, the TA will help local governments prepare integrated urban \nnutrition interventions using stakeholder consultations and the results of a baseline study on \nfood  consumption.  The  TA  will  focus  on  project  components  like  human  and  institutional \ncapacity  building  needs  in  the  public  and  private  sectors;  strengthening  management \ninformation  systems;  developing  behavioral  change  programs  for  urban  communities; \nrestructuring urban health services for improved nutrition management and alternative service \ndelivery strategies; strengthening public-private partnership in food fortification and food safety; \nand assessing the need for investments in management information systems, urban health \ninfrastructure, equipment, and upgrading food laboratories. The TA will determine the most cost-\neffective  approaches  to  establish  or  strengthen  community-based  initiatives  in  nutrition \nmonitoring and behavioral change. The TA will develop a policy framework for implementing \neffective integrated urban nutrition programs catering to the needs of the poor. The TA will \nseparately assess the role of the private sector and communities managing integrated urban \nnutrition programs. \n \n                                                \n12 It is estimated that in Asia the total societal costs of malnutrition are up to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). \n ", " 4  \n11.  The TA will prepare a feasibility study, including fully documented SPARs. The TA report \nwill  provide  a  detailed  project  description,  including  rationale  and  expected  development \noutcomes,  benefits,  poverty  impact  analysis,  a  logical  framework,  and  implementation \narrangements and schedules. All outputs will be analyzed for technical, financial, economic, \nsocial, environmental, and institutional sustainability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, of which $286,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $214,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$114,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The funds will cover the consultant remuneration (foreign and \ndomestic), national- and city-level workshops, and transportation costs. The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $100,000, by providing office space, \nexperienced counterpart staff, information and data collection, and logistical support. Appendix \n2 provides details of the cost and financing plan. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Directorate General of Community Health in the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be the \nExecuting Agency, which will coordinate with the Bureau of Planning and Budgeting of MOH. \nMOH will coordinate with oversight agencies and other ministries. The MOH technical team \nestablished  for  the  ADTA  will  continue  to  supervise  the  TA  and  will  coordinate  with  the \nProvincial Development Planning Board (BAPPEDA), Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of \nHome Affairs, National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN), Indonesian Coalition for \nFood Fortification (KFI), universities, research institutes, and the private sector. \n \n14.  The TA will provide technical support to Government and selected municipalities in \npreparing the Project. An interministerial steering committee will be set up to guide the TA. The \ncommittee will be chaired by the director general of community health in MOH, and include \nrepresentatives  from  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  and  the \nministries of finance, agriculture, home affairs, social affairs, resettlement, and food and drug \nadministration.  \n \n15.  The TA is expected to commence in September 2004 and be implemented over 5 \nmonths, with the final report delivered in March 2005. ADB will engage a team of international \n(12 person-months) and domestic (12.5 person-months) consultants with expertise in urban \nnutrition,  health  economy,  nutrition  and  food  policy,  public-private  partnerships,  financial \nmanagement, institutional development and decentralization, food fortification policy, gender, \nand poverty. The consultants will provide technical support to the municipalities in designing and \npreparing  SPARs,  including  fund-flow  mechanisms.  The  ADTA  team  had  gained  valuable \nexperience in working with municipalities on developing urban nutrition interventions. Few other \ncandidates would be able to match the experience and expertise. Therefore, direct selection of \nconsultants is proposed, pursuant to the provisions of Project Administration Instruction (PAI) \n2.04, para. 10. The indicative terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. They will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n16.  The consultants will produce (i) a midterm report after 8 weeks, with a draft project \nproposal and logical framework, including three SPARs; (ii) a draft final report, including a total ", "      5\nof six SPARs, using the format of a report and recommendation of the President after 14 weeks; \nand (iii) a final report after 19 weeks. All reports must be submitted in English, with a summary \nin Bahasa Indonesia. Tripartite reviews will be held after submission of the midterm, and final \nreports, which should include inputs from Government agencies, regional governments, civil \nsociety, nongovernment organizations, and the private sector. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for preparing the Urban Nutrition Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring   Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nProject Goal       \n       \nReduction of under-  Child malnutrition  Standard living surveys   \nand overnutrition  reduced from 34% in   \namong the urban poor  1995 to 17% in 2015  Nutrition monitoring \ncontributes to achieving    system \nMillennium  Stunting reduced by   \nDevelopment Goal 1:  25% in preschool  Population census \nEradicate extreme  children by 2010 \npoverty and hunger,   \nespecially target 4   \n(reduce the prevalence \nof underweight children \nunder 5 years of age) \n \nPurpose/Objective       \n       \nNutrition status of poor  All six cities are  As above  Ministry of Health advocacy \nurban dwellers in six  implementing urban  project management unit  for effective nutrition \nselected cities  nutrition interventions  and consultant records  interventions targeting the \nimproved  targeting the poor by  Household and Nutrition  urban poor is successful. \n  2010  Surveys undertaken by \n  stakeholders and research \nNumber of urban poor  institutions  \nhouseholds benefiting \nfrom improved nutrition \nstatus by 2010 \nOutputs       \n       \nNational policy  National policy  Progress reports and  Selected cities allocate \nframework for urban  approved in 2008  review missions  human and technical \nnutrition, including food    Project performance  resources to develop and \nfortification designed    monitoring system (PPMS)  implement well-targeted \n      urban nutrition \nIntegrated nutrition  Number of urban    interventions. \nprograms for urban  nutrition interventions      \npoor communities      The private sector remains \nimplemented using      involved in food fortification. \npublic-private       \npartnership and  Number of nutrition     \ncommunity-based   programs effectively     \nschemes  targeting the poor     \n       \nInstitutional and human       \ncapacities to implement       \nnutrition interventions       \nimproved     \n     \nContinued on next page ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nFRAMEWORK\u2014continued \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring   Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n     \n     \nImproved social    Independent assessment \ninfrastructure and  of ongoing nutrition \nequipment made  program quality \navailable \nActivities       \n       \nAssess existing  Consultation held     \nnutrition and food  among the private     \npolicies as well as laws  sector, aid agencies,     \nand regulations on food  and the Government     \nfortification        \n       \n       \nConduct a baseline  Food consumption     \nstudy on food  study in target areas     \nconsumption in poor  completed     \nurban households       \n       \n  National and regional     \n  governments and the   \nIdentify urban nutrition  private sector agree to,   \ninterventions for the  and determine, urban   \npublic and private  nutrition interventions \nsectors    \n   \n  Institutional capacity \n  and public-private \nComplete institutional  linkages for the Project \nand human resources  identified \nassessment    \n   \n  Poverty and social \n  analysis for the project \nComplete a poverty and  completed \nsocial analysis   \n  Fully costed SPARs \n  prepared \n   \n   \n   \n \nInputs       \nConsultants (12  Midterm report, SPARs,  TA review missions  Counterpart staff and budget \nperson-months,  draft final report, and  are available. \ninternational; and 12.5  final report \nperson-months   \ndomestic)   \n   \nNational workshops  Stakeholders agree and \nand regional  understand their roles, \nContinued on next page \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \nFRAMEWORK\u2014continued \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring   Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \ngovernment  responsibilities, and the \nconsultations  coordinating \n  mechanisms for urban \n  nutrition \n   \nSurvey  Baseline survey \n  conducted \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
