INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  approach  paper  for  India\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2012\u20132017)  indicates  that \napproximately $1 trillion will be required to finance infrastructure investment to maintain the \ntargeted gross domestic product growth rate of 9% during the plan period.1  With banks already \nreaching the bank regulatory limits on exposure to infrastructure, the key to reaching this target \nwill be to develop a delivery mechanism that can effectively make the economy\u2019s large pool of \nsavings available for needed long-term infrastructure investments. \n \n2.  Although  equity  markets  are  well  developed  within  the  Indian  capital  markets,  the \ncorporate bond market is quite small, with very limited access for issuers with local credit ratings \nbelow AA, thereby limiting the financing available to infrastructure developers. The proposed \napproach to expand access of investment grade corporations (i.e., those rated at least BBB-) to \nthe corporate bond market, through a credit enhancement mechanism, would be to introduce a \nbond guarantee agency by building on the lessons from the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI). \n \n3.  India has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to examine the modalities, \nscope, and potential for the establishment of a bond guarantee fund for India (BGFI) that (i) \nserves India\u2019s unique institutional and regulatory environment; and (ii) supports the development \nof the local currency bond market, to meet India\u2019s infrastructure and non-infrastructure financing \nrequirements. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2009\u20132012,2 which \nemphasizes  supporting  infrastructure  investment  in  India  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  large \ninfrastructure  deficit  by  catalyzing  investment  and  facilitating  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure development. The TA first appeared as a firm 2011 non-lending product in ADB\u2019s \nIndia country operations business plan 2011\u20132013.3  \n \n4.  The proposed TA is closely linked to the approved guarantee facility for project bonds. 4 \nThe proposed TA will examine the lessons from credit enhancement of project bonds to study \nthe feasibility of providing credit enhancements through guarantees on a standalone basis as a \nseparate line of business. Typically guarantee products are offered by specialized entities (such \nas monocline insurers) having specialized features and skills. The TA will thus provide guidance \non the modalities and operation aspects of such a specialized entity. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The  TA  supports  a  key  emerging  development  strategy  in  India  for  financing \ninfrastructure  and  developing  the  bond  market.  To  make  an  effective  contribution  to  the \naggregate infrastructure financing in India, the equity for BGFI should be substantial. With a \nleverage  ratio  of  1:4,  for  example,  a  capital  of  $1  billion  (potentially  shared  between  the \ngovernment, ADB, and other donors) would be required to extend bond guarantees of about $4 \nbillion. This level of guarantee would amount to about 20% of the corporate bonds outstanding \nat  the  end  of  2010. The  participation  of  other  parties  and/or  a  higher  contribution  by  the \ngovernment  could  augment  the  capital  and  the  guarantee  capacity  of  BGFI.  To  meet  the \n                                                \n1  This reflects an investment rate of approximately 36% of  gross domestic product in the economy and an \nincremental capital\u2013output ratio of approximately 4 over the plan period. \n2   ADB. 2009.

Guarantee Facility for Credit Enhancement of Project Bonds. Manila.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 June 2011. \n ", "2   \nobjective of financing $1 trillion of infrastructure investments in the next five-year plan, the \ncapacity of BGFI would need to be further extended.  \n \n6.  While there may  be  limited  instances  initially  in  which  BGFI  would  want  to  extend \nguarantees above the AAA domestic rating, there may be an opportunity cost in not aspiring to \nthe  AAA  international  rating,  which  would  allow  BGFI  to  assist  domestic  issuers  to  enter \ninternational markets. To achieve the desired rating upgrade for its infrastructure corporate \nclients, BGFI could employ partial or full guarantees. \n \n7.  With its guarantees, BGFI would have a significant impact on the development of the \ncorporate  bond  market  by  increasing  the  supply  of  AA  and  above-rated  bonds  from  the \ninfrastructure and non-infrastructure corporate sector, thereby promoting the expansion of the \ncorporate bond market. With credit protection, BGFI would help broaden investor base for local \nrupee-denominated bonds by making it possible for domestic institutional investors, especially \ninsurance and pension funds, to invest in credit-enhanced corporate bonds. Moreover, based on \nthe  experience  of  other  markets  (e.g.,  in  Singapore)  this  would  gradually  increase  the \nacceptance and demand for investment-rated corporate issues which could even be rated below \nAA, and provide firms with the option of future direct access to the corporate bond market. \n \n8.  Capacity development. Bond guarantees are new in India with the first infrastructure \nbond  issuances  being  supported  under  the  Guarantee  Facility  for  Credit  Enhancement  of \nProject Bonds (footnote 4). While there is a felt need in the market for the credit enhancement \nproduct and a pipeline is under discussion with respect to the above facility, several capacity \nconstraints exist in the market to mainstream the guarantee product. Specifically, these relate to \n(i) due diligence for undertaking longer tenor fixed rate risk as required for bond exposures; (ii) \nstructuring of security packages and indemnities for secured parties under a bond guarantee; (iii) \nguarantee structuring based on the stand-alone rating; (iv) pricing of first loss guarantee (which \nis new in India), compared with pari passu guarantee; and (v) need to evolve the guarantee \nproduct to include pricing and structuring of greenfield risk.6 Thus, a key objective of the BGFI \nwould be to disseminate best practices with respect to the above issues to all stakeholders \nwhich is critical if complex guarantee structures are to evolve and gain wider acceptance in the \nIndian market.        \n \n9.  Fees. The guarantee fees would be charged on the basis of the market spread and the \nreduced interest cost accorded through the guarantee upgrade. The benefit that BGFI accords \nthe issuer through lower interest rates would be shared in part with the issuer, although the \nmajority of the gains would go to BGFI to cover its risks. If the spreads available in the market \nwere not adequate to cover the cost of capital, the guarantee would need to be declined.7 \n \n10.  Governance. The governance of BGFI is a crucial factor that must be resolved in \nconsultation  with  the  government  to  ensure  that  a  credit  culture  permeates  BGFI  on  a \nsustainable basis. While guarantees are easy to give, it is difficult to sustain the dedication to \nfinancial due diligence required for profitable and sustainable operation of BGFI, without an \nenabling  internal  governance  structure.  Diversified  ownership  could  be  considered  to  help \n                                                \n6  Credit rating agencies typically require a first loss guarantee structure to recognize any credible level of rating \nupgrade. A first loss guarantee covers the entire bond service obligation on interest payment dates, covering \ninterest and principal payments up to a maximum cap amount, rather than partially covering a portion of debt \nservice to bond holders. However, this modality which is particularly suited for the infrastructure sector, requires \nfurther dissemination in the Indian market.  \n7  A key capacity building aspect would be to structure the guarantee and evaluate projects and security structures to \nreduce the extent of guarantee cover required in order to reduce guarantee fees.    \n ", "  3 \npromote governance within the board of directors, as could governance approaches such as \nmaking the chief credit officer report directly to the risk management committee of the board, \nwhile having a say in reporting guarantees to the board for their approval. \n \n11.  International experience and learning. While BGFI focuses on India, the experiences \nand lessons of ASEAN+3 with respect to the findings of the TA will be shared with other \ncountries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region through \nconvening of dedicated seminars under this TA. The first seminar could be (i) an ASEAN+3 \nseminar comprising participants at the working group level including selective representatives \nfrom India and one or two of SAARC countries with most developed bond markets; and (ii) a \nseminar inviting relevant officers from SAARC member countries, in particular, representatives \nfrom the Ministry of Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, and bond dealers and \ntraders, focusing on how these other countries may wish to develop plans for bond market \ndevelopment and harmonize their activities with India\u2019s BGFI initiative.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n12.  The impact of this TA is greater access by corporations to the local currency bond \nmarkets to meet their long-term infrastructure financing needs. A functional BGFI will help to roll \nout and mainstream the credit enhancement product in the Indian financial sector and channel \nIndia\u2019s large savings pool to the infrastructure and non-infrastructure corporates. Through its \nactivities, the BGFI would (i) support a new asset class for institutional investors and investment \nassets,  (ii)  mobilize  additional  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure  development,  and  (iii) \ndiversify  infrastructure  funding  sources  to  complement  bank  financing  and  thereby  reduce \nsystemic risk to the financial system. The outcome of this TA is to inform the government on the \nbenefits and mechanics on the establishment of a successful BGFI. The key TA outputs include \n(i) a detailed framework and institutional arrangements for BGFI, (ii) a blueprint to operationalize \nthe BGFI, and (iii) enhanced knowledge on BGFI.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.   The TA would finance the preparation of the studies across the different components \n(see below) to enable the government to decide on the creation the BGFI. The TA will build on \ninternational best practices including the work that led to the creation of the Credit Guarantee \nand Investment Facility (CGIF) as well as the background studies that have constituted the \ntechnical due diligence leading to Guarantee Facility for Credit Enhancement of Project Bonds \n(footnote 4). The TA will further develop the ongoing engagement with participating financial \ninstitutions, in this case, to study best case options for establishing the BGFI given the lessons \nlearned from the credit enhancement experience. The activities under the TA will be coordinated \nin  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  (OREI)  to  support  the \ntransfer of knowledge from their development of CGIF.  \n \n14.  The following key components and  activities will be undertaken.  \n \n(i)  Demand Analysis. Comprehensive analysis of the demand for bond issuance by \ninvestment-rated  infrastructure  and  non-infrastructure  corporations  in  India, \nfocusing on the potential volume of such issuance and the needed maturity and \nterms,  and  classifying  potential  issuers  by  (a)  type  of  institutions  (e.g.,  by \nindustry); and (b) by size and by rationale of their investment programs in local \n ", "4   \ncurrency.  The  analysis  will  also  assess  the  factors  that  favor  and  impede \ninvestment by these investors and the likely levels of assistance that will be \nafforded through the guarantee operations of BGFI.   \n \n(ii)  Structure of BGFI. Based on the recommendations of the demand analysis, a \nkey  activity  to  be  undertaken  is  the  determination,  in  conjunction  with  the \ngovernment, of (a) the required and desirable size of BGFI capitalization and \nprudent leverage ratio to meet the demand for local currency bond guarantees \nrequired  under  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2012\u20132017);  (b)  comprehensive \ncost\u2013benefit analyses of options to establish BGFI as a trust or as a company, \nincluding legal requirements, taxes, and prudential regulations that BGFI will \nhave to comply with; and (c) a business model for BGFI based on the outcomes \nof the findings above.  \n \n(iii)  Knowledge  dissemination.  As  indicated  above  (para.  8),  a  key  capacity \ndevelopment aspect is to generate awareness among all stakeholders on key \naspects of guarantee structuring and pricing. This is all the more important given \nthe regional dimension with respect to SAARC to enable member countries to \nbenefit from the Indian experience. The planned consultation seminars are key to \ndeveloping this aspect.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $960,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart remuneration, office accommodation and \nsupplies, transport, and other logistical support. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be administered by ADB\u2019s South Asia Department in coordination with OREI, \nwhich is working with ASEAN+3 as the Secretariat for ABMI. The Department of Financial \nServices of the Ministry of Finance will be the implementing agency. In addition, a steering \ncommittee chaired by the joint secretary concerned and comprising the Reserve Bank of India, \nthe Securities and Exchange Board of India, and the pension and insurance fund regulators will \nbe established to coordinate implementation of the TA. A project focal point will be identified to \ncoordinate activities across government agencies. The TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 will be used to track and evaluate progress \nin implementation. The TA will be implemented in approximately 12 months and is expected to \nbegin in February 2013 and be completed by February 2014. \n \n17.   The TA will require 18 person-months of international consulting services and 7 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. The consultants will be engaged by ADB under a \ncombination of a firm and as individual consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). An international consulting firm in \nassociation with national consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB, using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost weighting of 90:10. The simplified technical \nproposal procedure will be used to select the consultants. The international consultants will \ninclude financial sector specialists, who will also be the team leader, as well as corporate \n ", "  5 \ngovernance specialist, accountant, and legal expert. National consultants with expertise in most \nof these areas will be engaged for the same length of time under a firm to provide support to the \ninternational consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  The team leader will coordinate all consultant inputs. The consultants will submit (i) an \ninception report within 1 month of TA commencement; (ii) an interim progress report, including \nanalysis of the demand for bond guarantees by investment-rated corporations and the targeted \ncapitalization and governance approaches for BGFI 6 months after TA commencement; (iii) a \ndraft final report 7 months after TA commencement; and (iv) a final report after receiving and \nincorporating comments by ADB. The progress of the TA project will be discussed with the \ngovernment on a regular basis with regular reports to the implementing agency. These reports \nare  to  be  shared  with  government  officials  and  market  participants  through  dissemination \nseminars and workshops, as well as with ABMI members in coordination with OREI. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Preparing \nthe Bond Guarantee Fund for India, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nGreater access by  Share of corporate debt  BGFI records of  There is continued \ncorporations to the  market financing for  guarantees extended  policy focus on \nlocal currency bond  infrastructure projects  and BGFI annual reports  promoting bond \nmarkets to meet  relative to both domestic    markets for \ntheir long-term  bank financing and their  International Monetary  infrastructure financing  \ninfrastructure  offshore financing  Fund\u2019s International   \nfinancing needs  increases from <1% in  Financial Statistics  Guarantee modality \n  2012 to 10%\u201320% in 2020    for leveraging private \n     The Bank of  sector resources is \nThe percentage of  International Standards\u2019  considered \ncorporate bonds issued in  quarterly bulletins  commercially viable    \nthe \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018BBB\u2019 range will      \nincrease from <1% of GDP    Risk \nin 2012 to 5%\u20137%  during    International market \nthe 2018\u20132020 period    conditions induce \n    corporations to borrow \nabroad with low rates \nand ease of access \nOutcome      Assumption \nThe government is  Department of Financial  Gazette notification on  Prevailing market and \nwell-informed on  Services submits proposal  establishment of BGFI  regulatory  conditions \nthe benefits and  for Cabinet approval to    are favorable in \nmechanics on the  establish the BGFI by    enabling decision \nestablishment of a  October 2013    making on \nsuccessful BGFI  establishing the BGFI \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
