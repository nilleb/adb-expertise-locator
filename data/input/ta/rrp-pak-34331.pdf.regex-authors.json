Without canal irrigation, agricultural production is \nprecarious  and  poverty  is  pervasive.  The  Project  will  improve \naccess  to  inputs  and  markets;  enhance  water  storage, \nconservation,  and  conveyance;  and  diversify  the  sources  of \nincome, while at the same time overcoming fundamental barriers \nto  economic  development  such  as  illiteracy.  The  project \ncomponents include (i) provision of beneficiary-identified medium-\nscale infrastructure to unions based in barani areas (village and \nunion  development  component,  or  VUDC);  (ii) targeted poverty \nalleviation  through  community  groups;  (iii) enhanced  literacy \nthrough  skills  training;  and  (iv) institutional  and  implementation \nsupport. The Project is designed to be demand driven by the \nintended beneficiaries in both design and implementation. \n   \nRationale  Barani areas are, almost by definition, areas with high levels of \npoverty. The primary problem facing barani areas is a lack of \naccess to water for crop and livestock production and thus lower \nand  uncertain  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity.  However, \nmany other factors also add to the high levels of poverty. These \ninclude impeded access to markets, inputs, and services due to \ninadequate or nonexistent transportation infrastructure; a lack of \naccess  to  electricity,  with  negative  consequences  for  the \nproductive  potential  of  both  agriculture  and  off-farm  sectors; \nhealth and productivity constraints arising from limited access to \ndomestic drinking water; a limited range of alternative, high-value \ncrops  or  crop  varieties  specially  adapted  to  barani  areas; \ninadequate and poorly managed rangelands for livestock; serious \nloss  of  productive  land  due  to  water  and  wind  erosion;  poor \naccess to agriculture and livestock advisory and support services; \nand  low  levels  of  literacy,  which  impede  access  to  new \ntechnologies  or  the  adoption  of  alternative  income-earning \nactivities. Development activities in barani areas have been shown \nto be successful in tackling these problems when there have been \n ", "iv   \nhigh  levels  of  beneficiary  involvement  in  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  As  a  result  of  the  Punjab \nLocal  Government  Ordinance  of  2001,  official  institutional \nstructures now exist at grassroots level in rural areas to allow \nelected  representation  and  local  management  of  development \nactivities. In these conditions it is now possible to combine past \nexperience and lessons learned in barani areas with the new, \nrepresentative institutional structures in rural areas (union councils \nand zila councils) to implement a poverty-focused project that will \nreinforce the ongoing decentralization process and have a strong \ndevelopment impact on the ground. This will be achieved through \nthe  support  of  activities,  selected  and  managed  by  the \nbeneficiaries themselves, that enhance productivity of resources, \nimprove the quality of life for the areas\u2019 population, and improve \naccess to markets through better rural infrastructure.  \n   \nObjectives  The Project\u2019s objectives are to enhance access to land, water, \nmarkets,  services,  agricultural  inputs,  technologies,  and \nemployment among the population living in barani areas in order \nto increase incomes, improve the quality of life and, ultimately, \nreduce poverty among vulnerable groups within the project area. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  Project  will  strengthen  governance \nstructures, aid the process of devolution, and build capacity within \nlocal governments to plan and implement development activities. \nThe  Project  will  cover  those  districts  and  parts  of  districts  in \nPunjab province that have much barani land but that have yet to \nbe covered by a barani or area development project. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $58.6 million  equivalent \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $12.0 million, and local \ncurrency cost of $46.6 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The proposed financing plan is shown in the following table. It is \nproposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) finance the \nforeign exchange cost of $12.0 million as well as a portion of the \nlocal  currency  cost  ($29.0 million)  to  reach  a  total  financing \namount of  $41.0 million. The balance of the local cost will be \ncovered  partly  by  beneficiary  contributions  to  the  VUDC  and \ntargeted  poverty  alleviation  activities,  and  partly  by  the \nGovernment through the payment of duties and taxes and the \nincremental operational costs of district-level line agencies. \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total Cost  % \nExchange  Currency   \n   \nAsian Development Bank  12.0  29.0  41.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  8.8  8.8  15 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  8.8  8.8  15 \n  Total  12.0  46.6  58.6  100 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  proposed  ADB  financing  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources is equivalent in various currencies to SDR 27,207,000. \nThe loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years with an interest charge of 1% during the grace period \nand 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 January 2005 to 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Agency for Barani Area Development (ABAD) \n   \nImplementation  ABAD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project management  and \nArrangements  monitoring. This will be carried out by a small project management \nunit  to  be  set  up  in  ABAD\u2019s  head  office  in  Rawalpindi.  The \nimplementing  agencies  for  the  VUDC  will  be  the  district \ngovernments  of  the  10  project  districts.  ABAD  itself  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  targeted  poverty \nalleviation component, the literacy eradication through the skills \ntraining  component,  and  the  institutional  and  implementation \nsupport component. A project steering committee will undertake \nbroad oversight of the Project and its implementation. A district \nproject  implementation  committee  will  be  established  in  each \ndistrict to oversee and monitor project progress. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement will be undertaken following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Civil  works  will  be  small  to  medium  scale  and \nscattered,  and  will  thus  not  be  suitable  for  or  of  interest  to \ninternational  contractors.  Civil  works  will  thus  be  undertaken \nthrough local competitive bidding for local companies or by direct \nselection for beneficiary user groups.  \n \n   \n ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The Project will require support from \n399 person-months of consulting services, comprising 42 person-\nmonths of international consulting services and 357 months of \ndomestic consulting services. In addition, ABAD will recruit the \nservices of rural support programs, nongovernment organizations, \nor local consulting companies for the village and union organizers \nwho will work directly in the field with the union administrations, \nvillages, and district agencies to provide on-the-ground support to \nthe  VUDC.  About  1,080  person-months  of  village  and  union \norganizers input will be required.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will enhance the livelihood and quality of life of about \nBeneficiaries  350,000 households living in the rural areas of 200 of the poorest \nunions in Punjab that are dependent primarily on precarious rain-\nfed agriculture as their main source of income. In addition, poorer \ngroups  in  the  project  area  (about  70,000  households)  will  be \nspecially  targeted  for  programs  that  foster  group  income-\nenhancing activities.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Successful implementation rests upon several key assumptions \nand the mitigation of several risks. The design assumes that the \ncommunity mobilization can be carried out effectively to ensure \npoverty targeting and a participatory approach. It also assumes \nthat  environmental,  social,  and  gender  concerns  can  be \nsafeguarded in implementation. In terms of sustainability, it also \nassumes  that,  with  project  support,  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of established facilities will be ensured. The \nmajor risks for the Project include: (i) lack of capacity in district \nline agencies, and (ii) lack of accountability and political patronage \nat the district-level institutions.  \n \nFor community mobilization, the Project has included established \nrural support programs operating in the project districts. These \ninstitutions  already  have  location-specific,  gender-  and \nenvironment-sensitive  programs,  staff,  procedures,  and \nmonitoring systems\u2014all of which can be tapped in support of the \nProject.  For  social and  environmental  safeguards,  international \nconsultants for each of these disciplines will be engaged early to \nestablish a framework for screening subprojects. Concerns over \nO&M  will  be  partly  addressed  by  the  requirement  for  upfront \nbeneficiary  contributions,  which  invests  them  in  project \nsustainability. For the larger medium-scale infrastructure, such as \nroads or rural electrification, there will be established line agency \nprocedures and responsibilities. Also, under the Medium Term \nBudgetary Framework (2004/05\u20132007/08), O&M benchmarks are \nbeing upgraded, and an increasing, dedicated budget is being \nallocated to district O&M expenditure. \n \n ", "  vii\n  To offset the risk of limited capacity in line agencies, the Project \nprovides  for  a  specific  budget  for  line  agency  support  in \nimplementation,  and  for  consultants  for  technical  training, \nguidance,  and  support.  In  pursuit of  accountability,  the  design \ninvolves  a number of independent participants and institutions in \nimplementation;  the  flow  of  funds  for  VUDC  is  through  the \ngovernment system and within the purview of the Department of \nFinance;  monitoring  committees  have  been  established  under \nlocal  devolution;  and  community  organizations  have  been \nmobilized to act as concerned interest groups. \n   \n \n ", "  ix\n \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sustainable Livelihoods in Barani Areas Project. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Pakistan is one of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries \nthat has seen an increase in poverty levels over the past decade. While 26.1% of the country\u2019s \npopulation was classified as poor in 1990/91, the proportion had grown to 32.1% by 2000/01. In \nabsolute  terms,  the  number  of  poor  more  than  doubled  to  47 million  during  the  1990s. \nMoreover, Pakistan ranks poorly in several major social indicators: infant mortality is 90 per \n1,000 live births, malnutrition of children under 5 is 39%, adult literacy is 45% overall (and 31% \namong women),1 and 45% of the population have no access to health services. Pakistan ranks \namong the lower quarter of the human development index, with a ranking of 142 among 177 \ncountries, which is lower than other countries in South Asia. \n \n3.  Poverty in Pakistan is very much a rural phenomenon linked closely to the economic \nhealth of the agriculture sector. About 35 million or 75% of the estimated 47 million poor live in \nrural areas. This is especially true in Punjab province where 36.3 % of the rural population live \nbelow the poverty line. The proposed project districts include the four poorest districts in the \nprovince. About 47% of the rural population in these districts are estimated to be poor.2 These \nhigh levels of poverty in rural areas tie in closely with particularly low growth rates in the \nagriculture sector over the past decade. Growth in agricultural gross domestic product has been \nbelow 5% for most of the 1990s and, due to a prolonged and serious drought, contracted in \n2001  and  2002.  As  might  be  expected,  unirrigated,  or  barani3  areas  suffered  much  more \nseverely as a result of the drought than the canal-irrigated areas. Poor yields or complete crop \nfailures forced many farmers into debt and to abandon their lands during this period. Details on \nrecent developments in the agriculture sector and the barani subsector are given in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  In addition to its direct relationship with the viability of the agriculture sector, rural poverty \nis also linked to other factors. Indeed, poor governance has been identified as one of the \nprimary causes of continued poverty in the country and especially in rural areas.4 In response to \nthe need for improved governance in rural areas, the Government has recently taken major \nsteps to restructure its lower institutional levels. These have comprised a devolution of powers \nand responsibilities to the district, tehsil (subdistrict), and union (sub-subdistrict) levels, most \nnotably the passage of the Punjab Local Government Ordinance of 2001 setting up elected local \ncouncils. Elections of representatives to district, tehsil, and union have since taken place. This \nhas been a dramatic development, since with seats reserved for women, small farmers, and the \npoor, a disadvantaged portion of the population has been given grassroots representation for \n                                                 \n1    Equivalent figures for rural areas in Punjab province are 35% and 21%, respectively. \n2   Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n3   The term barani as used in this report refers to areas outside of the command of the extensive irrigation systems \nupon which most of Pakistan\u2019s agricultural productivity is based. \n4   ADB. 2002. Poverty in Pakistan: Issues, Causes and Institutional Response. Manila. \n ", " 2  \nthe first time. This move toward the decentralization and devolution of powers has been strongly \nsupported by ADB through the Decentralization Support Program, approved in October 2002.5 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Around  70%  of  the  cultivated  area  in  Punjab  province  is  within  a  major  irrigated \ncommand,  allowing  farmers  reasonably  assured  access  to  water  and,  as  a  result,  both \nguaranteed and relatively high crop yields. On the remaining 30% of the cultivated area, rain-fed \nor barani crop production is undertaken without irrigation or with only sparse irrigation from \nlocal, often makeshift, sources. In a predominantly arid country like Pakistan this means that \nfarming in these areas is especially prone to drought and consequent crop losses and failures. \nDespite drought mitigation measures and coping strategies, barani farming is thus both a low \nproductivity and high risk venture. Yields on barani lands are typically, on average, only 30\u201350% \nof those on irrigated lands. As a consequence, farm incomes are uncertain and insecure, and \npoverty levels are high. Within rural areas of the country, then, the barani areas are even more \nsusceptible to high incidences of poverty than other rural areas. \n \n6.  Focusing development activities on the barani areas is thus one way of capturing a \nparticularly poor and disadvantaged segment of the population. It was with this in view that the \n2002 ADB country programming mission confirmed the Government of Pakistan\u2019s request for \ntechnical assistance to prepare a barani area development project in Punjab province. A project \nof this nature was considered fully consistent with the Government\u2019s vision and development \ngoals articulated in the Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan (2001/02\u20132010/11) and its \npoverty alleviation strategy. It was also consistent with the emphasis of the ADB 2002 country \nstrategy, which emphasized poverty alleviation through rural economic growth. \n \n7.  The primary problem facing barani areas is a lack of access to water for crop and \nlivestock  production  and  thus  lower  and  uncertain  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity. \nHowever, many other factors also add to the high levels of poverty in these areas. These \ninclude impeded access to markets, inputs, and services due to inadequate or nonexistent \ntransportation infrastructure; a lack of access to electricity, with negative consequences for the \nproductive potential of both agriculture and off-farm sectors; health and productivity constraints \narising from limited access to domestic drinking water; a limited range of alternative, high value \ncrops or crop varieties specially adapted to barani areas; inadequate and poorly managed \nrangelands for livestock; serious loss of productive land due to water and wind erosion; poor \naccess to agriculture and livestock advisory and support services; and low levels of literacy, \nwhich impede access to new technologies or the adoption of alternative income-earning activities. \n \n8.  In the past, several projects aimed wholly or partly at improvement of barani areas have \nbeen  undertaken  with  financing  from  ADB  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  financing \ninstitutions (Appendix 2). These include the First and Second Punjab Barani Area Development \nprojects,6  the  First7  and  Second8  Northwest  Frontier  Province  Barani  Area  Development \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", "  3\nprojects,  the  Bahawalpur  Rural  Development  Project,9  and  the  Dera  Ghazi  Khan  Rural \nDevelopment Project.10 In the course of these projects, techniques have been developed to \nenhance crop production on barani lands, improve associated and ancillary income-earning \nactivities such as livestock production, enhance the quality of life in barani areas, and facilitate \nsocial organization and mobilization to efficiently and effectively implement development projects. \n \n9.  However, large parts of the barani areas in Punjab province have yet to be covered by \nany type of agricultural or rural development project. Consequently, millions of people in barani \nareas living both below and just above the poverty line have little access to measures to help \nimprove their livelihoods. Expanding known technologies and development techniques to these \nareas and supplementing them with innovative measures will help reduce poverty, in a focused \nand targeted manner, among one of the most disadvantaged groups in the country. Consistent \nwith its rural and agricultural priorities, the government of Punjab places a high priority on the \ndevelopment of the barani areas. Recently a ministerial committee has been constituted by the \nChief Minister of Punjab to supervise the development of a comprehensive package for the \ndevelopment of high impact interventions suited to the widely variable agro-ecology of the \nbarani areas. Government\u2019s articulation of the future vision and strategy is reflected in the \nPunjab Economic Report.11  \n \n10.  Measures that can be used to enhance livelihoods in rural areas include those (i) that \nare aimed directly at lifting productivity, (ii) that are aimed at improving the quality of life and \nthus indirectly enhancing livelihoods, and (iii) that directly impact on both productivity and the \nquality of life. Productivity in barani areas can be lifted by (i) improving crop yields through \nimproved varieties, farming techniques, and water management; (ii) enhancing productivity in \nnoncrop  agriculture,  principally  livestock  production,  through  improved  animal  nutrition  and \nhealth and improved range management; and (iii) enhancing nonfarm incomes through training \nin skills development and access to financial services, small-scale industries, handicrafts, and \nprovision  of  services.  The  quality  of  life  can  be  improved  through  provision  of  safe  and \naccessible drinking water, provision of access to health facilities, and provision or improvement \nof access to education.12 These measures can, in turn, ultimately lead to enhanced productivity \nthrough the reduction of time spent in fetching water (which can account for more than 4 hours a \nday), reduction in time and work-power lost to illness and disease, and an improvement in the \nability to adopt new earnings techniques and skills through literacy and numeracy. Finally, one \nof the primary measures to be taken to both enhance productivity and improve the quality of life \nis provision of rural infrastructure, especially rural roads. These can open up new access to \nmarkets for produce of the barani areas, reduce transportation costs for outputs and inputs, \nprovide better access to services, and reduce travel time and expenditures for the areas\u2019 \npopulation. A further critical measure that can enhance both the quality of life and productivity is \nrural electrification. This provides both a source of power for productive activities, such as water \npumping and small-scale industries, as well as improved access to the outside world through \nbetter education and communications. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1996.

Manila. \n11  Pakistan: Punjab Economic Report-Towards a Medium Term Development Strategy (Government of Punjab, \nOctober 2004). \n12  Approximately 50% of the population over 5 years of age in the barani areas of the proposed project districts have \nnever been to a school of any kind. \n ", " 4  \n11.  However,  simply  replicating  past  efforts  at  rural  development  in  barani  areas  is \ninsufficient. Most of these measures, with the exception of rural electrification, have been used \nduring  past  barani  and  rural  development  projects  with  mixed  results.  In  terms  of  project \ncompletion reports, the Second Punjab Barani Area Development Project, for example, was \nassessed as only being partly successful, whereas the North-West Frontier Province Barani Area \nDevelopment Project was assessed as being successful overall, although some components \nwere not entirely implemented as planned. Moreover, measures that proved successful under \none project seemed to have been unsuccessful under the other. For example, village water \nsupply under the Second Punjab Barani Area Development Project was considered successful \nand  sustainable  while  under  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  Barani  Area  Development \nProject, this component was considered unsuccessful. One of the lessons learned from all such \nprojects and emphasized in project completion reports and project performance audit reports is \nthat for a project in rural areas to be successfully implemented and subsequently successfully \nsustained, beneficiaries should be fully involved in the identification, design, and implementation \nof project activities. Another key lesson learned in past and ongoing projects in barani areas is \nthat, while there are many technical interventions that can be used to reduce poverty and \nenhance the quality of life in barani areas, the key to success is to align these to the local needs \nof the resource-poor beneficiaries. To a large extent, this means that the beneficiaries should \nhave a major role in both selecting and implementing project-financed interventions that they \nthemselves see as affordable and important in improving their livelihood. Therefore, effective \nlinks between the line agencies and community social mobilizers are critical for translating the \nneeds of the resource-poor communities into viable and affordable interventions.  \n \n12.  In  this  context,  the  decentralization  reforms  currently  being  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment  present  a  unique  opportunity.  As  a  result  of  the  Punjab  Local  Government \nOrdinance of 2001, official institutional structures now exist at grassroots level in rural areas to \nallow  elected  representation  and  local  management  of  development  activities.  In  these \nconditions, it is now possible to combine past experience and lessons learned in barani areas \nwith the new, representative, institutional structures in rural areas (district, tehsil, union, and \nvillage  councils)  to  implement  a  poverty-focused  project  that  will  reinforce  the  ongoing \ndecentralization process and have a strong development impact on the ground. Moreover, \nbarani areas are, almost by definition, areas of high levels of poverty. It will thus now be \npossible to target areas with high levels of poverty through a beneficiary-driven process. The \nproposed project has thus been designed to work through the new local government institutions \nand use the lessons and techniques learned from past barani and rural development projects to \nmake a strong positive impact on the livelihood of barani areas not yet covered by existing \nbarani or rural development projects. This will be achieved through the support of activities, \nselected and managed by the beneficiaries themselves, that enhance productivity of resources, \nimprove the quality of life for the areas\u2019 population, improve access of the global population to \nmarkets  through  better  rural  infrastructure,  and  enhance  access  to  opportunities  in  skills \nimprovement and enterprise development. \n \n13.  Public investment in barani areas is justified because there are large public externalities \nassociated  with  improved  access,  with  community-level  land  and  water  development,  with \nhealth and education, as well as with organizing intended beneficiaries and groups of the \nvulnerable poor for participation in livelihood-enhancing activities. Reliance on private sector \nfunding alone would result in underinvestment. Further, the ability to mobilize funds for initial \ninvestments is an issue as a large portion of the barani population lives in abject poverty. They \nhave insufficient means or credit standing to secure economically viable investments and barely \nenough for their day-to-day subsistence needs. ADB lending is justified due to (i) insufficiency of \nnational government funds to effectively cover the capital needs for all areas and sectors of the \n ", "  5\neconomy,  (ii) ADB's  ability  to  leverage  poverty-oriented  investment  through  improved \ngovernance and enhanced participation by the rural poor, and (iii) the opportunity to strengthen \nand reinforce the recently promulgated government devolution. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n14.  The Project\u2019s objectives, as reflected in the Project Framework in Appendix 3, are to \nenhance  access  to  land,  water,  markets,  services,  agricultural  inputs,  technologies,  and \nemployment for the population of barani areas in order to increase incomes, improve the quality \nof life and, ultimately, reduce poverty among vulnerable groups within the project area. At the \nsame, the Project will strengthen governance structures, aid the process of devolution, and build \nthe capacity within local governments to plan and implement development activities. The Project \nwill cover those districts and parts of districts in Punjab province that have a substantial area of \nbarani land, but that have yet to be covered by a barani or area development project. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n15.  Based on past experience, two general types of intervention are envisaged: (i) medium-\nscale interventions such as the provision of rural access roads, electricity, water storage or \nconveyance  structures,  range  improvement,  social  forestry,  and  the  provision  of  social \ninfrastructure; and (ii) fairly small-scale but intensive activities that can be undertaken by small \ncommunity  groups,  such  as  livestock  health  improvement,  the  promotion  of  improved \nagricultural practices, the provision of dugwells, on-farm water management and conservation \nactivities, and training programs in literacy or nonfarm livelihood activities.  \n \n16.  In the current circumstances in Punjab province, it is most appropriate for the former \ntype of investment to be identified at the village and union levels and implemented by the district \ngovernments, and for the latter type to be identified and implemented within communities with \nthe assistance of a qualified and experienced rural support program (RSP).13 The proposed \nProject will thus consist of two main components: the village and union development component \n(VUDC) designed to identify and implement demand driven medium-scale interventions, and the \ntargeted poverty alleviation component designed to scale up ongoing poverty-targeted activities \ncurrently being undertaken by the RSPs to a greater or lesser degree within barani communities \nof the project area. These two components will be supplemented by the following: Literacy \nthrough Skills Training; and Institutional and Implementation Support.   \n \n17.  The project area will be the barani areas of the 10 districts of Bhakkar, Chakwal, Gujrat, \nJhelum, Khushab, Layyah, Mianwali, Narowal, Rawalpindi, and Sialkot, and that have yet to be \ntaken up by a barani or area development project. The barani areas of these districts include a \n                                                 \n13 The success of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program as the first large-scale (regional) experiment of social \norganization in the rural communities of northern Pakistan gave impetus to the growth of larger (regional and \nnational) rural support programs, primarily supported through endowments received from the Government. RSPs \nare currently operating in all four provinces, the Northern Areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and aim to reduce \npoverty and improve the quality of life of the rural poor by harnessing their potential to help themselves. Common \nareas of support given by RSPs to communities include: technical and financial support for building village \nphysical  infrastructure,  provision  of  microcredit,  support  in  the  natural  resource  sectors,  small  enterprise \ndevelopment, and support to poor communities in the social sectors. \n ", " 6  \npopulation of about 3.2 million living in about 2,500 villages organized into 200 unions. The \nproject components will be as follows. \n \n1.  Village and Union Development Component \n \n18.  The VUDC is designed to provide financing for medium-scale infrastructure and other \ninterventions that will help to stimulate livelihood improvement in the barani areas. These will \nnormally consist of medium-scale rural infrastructure investments, such as upgraded feeder \nroads,  markets  and  market  improvements,  power  line  connections,  water  conveyance  or \nstorage  schemes,  community  groundwater  development,  erosion  control  or  social  forestry \nmeasures, shelterbelts, domestic water supply schemes, or any other feasible civil works or \nnatural  resources  management  intervention  considered  to  be  of  high  priority  by  local \npopulations at the village and union level. By the end of the Project, it is estimated that in each \nunion, two to four medium-scale interventions will be undertaken and over the project period the \ncoverage  is  likely  to  extend  to  1,800  community/village  groups  representing  370,000 \nhouseholds.  \n \n19.  Assistance  in  assessing  development  potential  within  the  union,  identifying  priority \npoverty targets, and preparing requests and submissions will be provided by a national or \nprovincial  RSP, national nongovernment organization (NGO), or a local consulting company \nrecruited by the Project. Staff of the RSP, NGO, or local company will act in an advisory capacity \nat  both  the  district  and  union  levels  to  assist  in  implementation  of  the  component. \nImplementation will be undertaken under the supervision of district technical line agency staff. \nThese staff and their offices will be provided with technical and logistics support under the \nProject as appropriate for the interventions being undertaken. Agencies to be supported will \ninclude  the  district  offices  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  Communications  and  Works,  Forestry, \nCommunity  Development,  and  Soil  Conservation.  Some  interventions,  such  as  rural \nelectrification  and  range  management  improvement,  will  entail  nondevolved  functions.  For \nthese, the relevant provincial or national agency will be retained by the district to undertake \nimplementation. \n \n20.  To assist the district line agencies to implement the VUDC and the work with the RSPs \nunder the targeted poverty alleviation component, provision has been made for support, as \nrequired for the district-level line agencies.  \n \n2.  Targeted Poverty Alleviation  \n \n21.  Through a dedicated Targeted Poverty Alleviation component, the Project also makes \nprovision for small-scale poverty alleviation interventions targeted directly at small beneficiary \ngroups of not less than 10 participants. These will include both men\u2019s community organizations \n(MCOs) and women\u2019s community organizations (WCOs). Activities will be demand-based and \nwill include such small-scale livelihood activities as the provision of dug-wells, water course \nlining,  farmer  field  schools  for  integrated  crop  management,  the  provision  of  livestock  for \nmultiplication, the provision of a basic schoolhouse along with literacy and skills training classes, \nand minor water resource conservation and irrigation infrastructure on a localized basis. Over \nthe project period, about 4,500 MCOs and WCOs are expected to be formed with a total \nrepresentation of 500,000 households to undertake 10\u201312 small-scale community infrastructure \nschemes in each of the 200 unions. Beneficiary participants will need to provide contributions in \ncash or in kind to varying degrees, based on the policies of the implementing agencies involved. \nSchemes and investments will be selected to ensure that the benefits are experienced by as \nwide  a  cross  section of  the  groups  as  possible  and  to avoid  appropriation  of benefits  by \n ", "  7\nprivileged groups or individuals. The most efficient and effective means of implementing this \nfund at the community level will be for Agency for Barani Area Development (ABAD) to enter \ninto  contracts  with  RSPs  and  provide  them  with  the  resources  needed  to  scale  up  their \nactivities.14 In most of the project districts, RSPs,15 either the National Rural Support Program \n(NRSP) or the Punjab Rural Support Program (PRSP), are already operating, undertaking \nlivelihood activities that directly target the poorer sections of the population. Not only do these \nRSPs already know the conditions and potential of the project districts but they also have \nestablished programs and contacts in many of the barani areas. \n \n22.  An integrated approach  to natural resorces management will  contribute  in increasing \nlivestock and farming productivity and hence enhance improve livelihood opportunities for the \nresource-poor  farming  community.  This  component  will  thus  also  include  a  provision  for \ndirected, demand-driven research and extension initiatives to be undertaken by the national, \nprovincial, and other research institutions present in the barani areas of Punjab, based on \nproblems identified by community groups. \n \n23.  Due to lack of income from farm-related activity in barani areas, improvements to off-farm \nincome  in  employment  and  small  and  microbusiness  can  result  in  major  benefits  to  the \npopulation. The Project will provide funding and consultancy to the two RSPs working in the \nproject area to change the current focus on vocational training to a demand-based, employer-\nlinked effort in partnership with the private sector and vocational training suppliers with whom \nthe RSPs are already in partnership. The Project will assist RSPs to develop entrepreneur \nattitudes and small business management training through linking the RSPs to the programs of \nthe Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority and other enterprise development and \ntraining programs. In trades where self-employment and small business are possible, vocational \ntraining will be linked to entrepreneurship and small business training as well as follow-up \nbusiness development services. The Project will strengthen access to microfinance by financing \nsocial mobilization costs of RSPs and required skills training for beneficiaries. RSPs and banks \n(such as Khushali, Zarai Taraqiati Bank of Pakistan, and others) will then be able to provide credit \nto these mobilized groups from their own funds. (For details see Supplementary Appendix A.) \n \n3.  Literacy Through Skills Training \n \n24.  One of the primary constraints to development in the project area is the very low literacy \nrate, especially among women. With low, indeed practically nonexistent literacy and numeracy \nskills, it is very difficult for the women to learn new livelihood skills. On the other hand, in a very \ntraditional society it is difficult to promote literacy programs without some kind of incentive over \nand above literacy itself. Combining programs in skills training and literacy is one means of both \novercoming illiteracy and promoting livelihood improvements. This is especially the case if skills \ntraining can be itself linked to rural finance programs so that the skills can be turned into \ninvestments. \n \n25.  This component will thus aim at direct poverty alleviation by targeting a particularly \ndeprived section of the population, namely poor women and girls. It will be based on the results \nof  the  ADB-financed  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  for  Non-Formal  Primary  Education  and \nFunctional Literacy for Rural Women in Selected Barani Areas of Punjab (Non-Formal Primary \n                                                 \n14  Through these partnerships, linkages with other financial institutions, business development services, and related \ndevelopment initiatives in the respective union councils and villages will be facilitated.  \n15  The  rationale  for  partnering  with  RSPs  and  a  brief  note  on  their  history  and  program  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n ", " 8  \nEducation).16 This TA is designed to support a program of curriculum development for women\u2019s \nliteracy training through the promotion of livelihood skills, as well as nonformal education.  \n \n26.  The activities under this component will be aimed directly at small groups of 10\u201315 \nwomen participants. Over 12,000 women and girls are expected to benefit from exposure to \nliteracy and basic skills under the component. Under the supervision of the RSP staff working at \neach union, domestic NGOs will be recruited to identify particularly vulnerable and poverty-\naffected groups and to organize WCOs among them. As groups are formed, the methodologies \nworked out under the Non-Formal Primary Education TA will be applied to a combined program of \nlocation and needs-specific curriculum development, teacher training in the use of the curriculum \nmaterials,  skills  development,  and  literacy  eradication.  Skills  to  be  emphasized  will  include \nactivities such as small-scale domestic livelihood enterprises like livestock raising, market and \nkitchen gardening, small-scale handicrafts, food preparation, and tailoring, as well as basic skills \nsuch as household health and sanitation, child care, dietary improvement, food preservation, and \nbasic household finances. The particular skills to be learned will be decided upon by the groups \nthemselves. Support for group formation and supervision will be financed by the Project. \n \n27.  One of the roles of the RSP will be to provide linkages to the Department of Literacy and \nNon-Formal  Education  and  other  government  agencies  that  provide  advice  and  undertake \nprograms in the areas of skills development selected by the group members. Another will be to \nestablish links to rural finance agencies, which may be able to provide funding for enterprise \ndevelopment. If suitable, the WCOs will be turned into borrowers\u2019 groups for financing provision \nby rural finance agencies. This possibility may prove an incentive for group formation and \nencourage participation in literacy program. \n \n  4.  Institutional and Implementation Support \n \n28.  Institutional and implementation support will include (i) the services of an RSP, domestic \nNGO, or local consulting company to be recruited on contract to provide technical inputs at the \nunion level and to assist with the implementation of the VUDC; (ii) international and domestic \nconsulting services to help initiate and manage the Project, provide guidance to the community \norganizers, train the staff of district line agencies, and support the staff of ABAD; (iii) support \nincluding  transport,  office  space,  and  equipment  as  well  as  incremental  staff  for  a  small \nmanagement  unit  within  the  offices  of  ABAD;  and  (iv) support  to  ABAD  for  the  project \nperformance management system.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n29.  The  main  special  feature  of  the  project  design  is  the  effort  being  made  by  the \nGovernment to ensure that the project management and implementation arrangements conform \nto  the  current  local  government  institutional  structure.  The  present  implementation  and \nmanagement structure has been designed to strengthen and reinforce the newly revamped local \ngovernment structure, giving support to ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts to assist the Government with its \ndecentralization efforts. By providing funding and a defined task for unions and districts to \nperform, the Project is designed to build sound capacity within these institutions and provide a \nmodel for future development projects in the rural and agriculture sectors.  \n \n                                                 \n16  The advisory technical assistance is financed through the Poverty Alleviation Cooperation Fund and was approved \non 13 October 2004. \n ", "  9\n30.  Thus far, only 2% of the population in the project area have access to collateral-free \ncredit. Furthermore, several of the unions in the barani areas do not have access to financial \nservices.  In  partnering  with  NRSP  and  PRSP, the  Project  will  facilitate  the  scaling  of  the \noperations of these RSPs to tehsils presently not served by the microfinance institutions. This \nwill result in a significant growth of their client base and in turn access to credit for the people in \nthe project area. In addition, the Project makes provision for specific assistance to communities, \nRSPs, and other institutions in business development, market-oriented skills development, and \non- and off-farm enterprise development opportunities.  \n \n31.  A further special feature is the strengthening of line agencies that will take place at the \ndistrict level. Through the Project, improvements will be made to ensure that these agencies, \nwhich under the devolution policy now have the mandate for managing rural development \nactivities, have the physical and skills capacity to undertake their responsibilities under a clearly \nset out performance-based and demand-driven contract modality.  \n \n32.  Lastly, the Project will take aim at one of the major constraints to sustained livelihood \nimprovement in rural areas of Punjab, i.e., the low educational and skills level of rural women. \nOne component of the Project is expressly designed to help overcome this major deficiency. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n33.  Summary cost estimates for the Project are provided in Table 1. The total project cost is \nestimated at $58.6 million, of which the foreign exchange component is $12.0 million and the \nlocal currency cost equivalent is $46.6 million.

Financing Plan \n \n34.  The proposed financing plan is shown in Table 2. It is proposed that ADB finance the \n$12.0 million foreign exchange cost as well as a portion of the local currency cost ($29.0 million) \n ", " 10  \nto reach a total financing amount of $41.0 million. The balance of the local cost will be covered \npartly by beneficiary contributions to the VUDC and targeted poverty alleviation activities and \npartly by the Government. The total financing percentage of ADB will be 70%, and that of the \nGovernment and the beneficiaries 15% each. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local   Total  % \nExchange  Currency   \nAsian Development Bank  12.0  29.0  41.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  8.8  8.8  15 \nBeneficiaries   0.0  8.8  8.8  15 \n          Total  12.0  46.6  58.6  100 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.   Project Management \n \n35.  The proposed project management structure is shown in Appendix 5. The Executing \nAgency for the Project will be ABAD, which will be responsible for overall project management \nand monitoring. These tasks will be carried out through a project management unit (PMU) to be \nset up in ABAD\u2019s head office in Rawalpindi. The PMU will be staffed by a full-time project \ndirector, a deputy project director, two full-time accountants, three environmental compliance \nofficers, three social and gender compliance officers, a project benefit monitoring officer, and \nappropriate  administrative    staff.  A  district  project  manager  (DPM)  and  a  district  project \naccountant will be appointed within one month of loan effectiveness by ABAD for each Project \ndistrict. The staffing for the PMU is shown in Supplementary Appendix K. A team of international \nand domestic consultants will assist ABAD and the respective district governments in the initial \nyears of the Project\u2019s operation. Their initial role will be to help with project start-up and to assist \nwith the identification of a menu of interventions for the VUDC. Later they will advise on the \ntechnical aspects of proposed project interventions. \n \n36.  The district governments of the 10 project districts will be the implementing agencies for \nthe VUDC. They will be responsible for day-to-day management of the component. The district \ngovernment will be supported and guided by the DPMs and the district project accountants \nprovided by ABAD as well as by the international and local consultants. ABAD itself will be the \nimplementing agency for the other components of the Project. \n \n37.  Broad oversight of the Project and its implementation will be undertaken by a project \nsteering  committee.  This  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  chairperson,  planning  and \ndevelopment, of the government of Punjab and will be made up of the secretaries of the key line \nagencies17, director general of ABAD, and representatives  of the RSPs participating in the \nProject. The district coordination officer of each district covered by the Project may participate in \nthe meeting  as required. The committee will meet at least once every 6 months to review the \nprogress of the Project and to act on any issues in need of resolution at the provincial level. \n                                                 \n17 Department of Agriculture, Department of Livestock, Department of Literacy and Non Formal, Department of \nCommunication  and  Works,  Department  of  Housing,  Urban  Development  and  Public  Health  Engineering, \nDepartment of Local Government and Rural Development, Department of Education, Department of Forestry, and \nDepartment of Finance.  \n ", " 11\n \n38.  Implementation of the VUDC may involve a number of different line agencies at the \ndistrict level. For the coordination and oversight of its implementation, each district government \nwill appoint within one month of loan effectives an executive district officer  as the district project \ncoordinator to coordinate and implement  the VUDC. \n \n39.  A  district  project  implementation  committee  (DPIC)  will  supervise  and  monitor  the \nactivities of the project at the district level. The committee will be chaired by the respective \ndistrict coordination officers18and consist of, among other people, the district project coordinator \nas the secretary, the DPM (from ABAD), and a representative of the rural support program \nresponsible for social mobilization.  The chair of the DPIC will  will determine and nominate any \nother member it deems necessary to be included in the DPIC. \n \n40.  A  project  consultative  forum  made  up  of  elected  representatives  of  the  10  project \ndistricts, representatives of civil society, and other key stakeholders to be selected by the \ngovernment of Punjab will be established within the first year of the Project. The forum will \nconsult with ABAD semiannually.  \n \n2.  Implementation of the Village and Union Development Component \n \n41.  A flow chart showing the procedures for the selection and approval of interventions \nunder the VUDC is provided in Supplementary Appendix L. Proposals for funding under the \nVUDC will be generated in the villages in each union by the resident population of the area. \nABAD will hire a known and proven RSP, domestic NGO, or local consulting company to \nprovide personnel skilled in community mobilization (village and union coordinators) to help with \nthese activities in each district. The proposals, prepared with the assistance of the village and \nunion coordinators, will be assessed and prioritized by the union council. The endorsed, high \npriority, interventions will be submitted for technical assessment by the district line agencies and \napproval by the district development committee.  \n \n42.  To assist the district line agencies to implement the VUDC, provision has been made for \nsupport, as required, on an identified needs basis. This support will be determined during the \nevaluation of the union council proposals by the district development committee. As the line \nagencies assess the feasibility of the union council proposals, they will also assess their own \nneeds in order to implement the works involved. This support may include incremental staff on \ncontract, equipment, or training. These requirements will be costed and submitted as part of the \noverall proposal to the district development committee (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n43.  Upon  technical  approval,  the  proposals  will  be  resubmitted  as  PC1s19  (where \nappropriate) to the district development committee for final approval of funding. Implementation \nwill  be  undertaken  by  the  district  line  agencies  following  standard  government  of  Punjab \nprocedures  and  practices.  During  implementation,  the  union  council  will  be  tasked  with \nmonitoring the progress of implementation and ensuring full beneficiary participation in the \nfunded works. The Project will also provide support to build the capacity of the union council to \nensure  effective  monitoring  of  the  activities  under  this  component.  This  will  be  done  in \n                                                 \n18 The district coordination officer is the senior civil servant in the district as provided under Punjab Local Government \nOrdinance 2001. \n19 Planning Commission Proforma 1 (PC1) \u2013 A document prepared by the Government to appraise all investments \nexceeding $25,000 (equivalent). \n \n ", " 12  \ncoordination with other ADB efforts to build the capacity of union administration (such as ADB\u2019s \nDecentralization Support Program and the proposed Punjab Devolved Social Service Project). \nThe  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  the  necessary  accountability  and  transparency \nmechanism  under  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  will  be  adopted  to  ensure \neffective implementation and monitoring of the Project. \n \n44.  ABAD, along with the project management consultants provided to it, will be responsible \nfor reviewing proposals approved by the district development committee to ensure that the \nunion councils are making effective judgments on the proposals that they accept and that valid \nproposals are being approved at the district level. Any issues or anomalies will be reported \ninitially  to  the  district  project  implementation  committee  and  then  to  the  project  steering \ncommittee.  \n \n3.  Implementation of the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Component \n \n45.  The targeted poverty alleviation component will be undertaken by an RSP currently \nworking in the district concerned. At present NRSP is working, to a greater or lesser degree, in \nsix of the 10 districts and PRSP is working in the other four. ABAD will enter into an agreement \nwith NRSP and PRSP to formalize arrangements for the upscaling of their activities under the \nProject. This agreement will be based on a work plan submitted to ABAD and the district \ngovernment  by  the  RSP  concerned.  The  funds  provided  will  amount  to  around  $50,000 \nequivalent for each union and will be used to support community-based livelihood activities \ntargeted at the poor through the formation of MCOs and WCOs. Activities will include the \nformation of citizen community boards in order to increase access to the local development \nfunding made available to these groups under Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2001. The \nRSPs will develop the necessary selection criteria for the activities to be funded under this \ncomponent.  A  committee,  to  include  representations  from  the  participating  RSPs  and  the \nparticipating district governments and union administration, will be established to select the \nproposals. Where possible, RSPs will provide training and necessary support for business \npromotion  and  enterprise  development  through  collaboration  with  the  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise  Development  Authority  and  others  as  appropriate  to  help  maximize  access  of \nbeneficiaries to the credit lines available from other sources in the Project. Activities of the RSPs \nwill be undertaken in general coordination with the district project manager. The RSPs will also \nbe  required  to  submit  semi-annual  reports  to  the  zila  council  and  union  council  on  the \nimplementation of its activities.   \n  \n  4.  Implementation of the Literacy Through Skills Training Component \n \n46.  Literacy and skills-based training will be undertaken by domestic NGOs recruited by \nABAD on the recommendation of the RSP, the concerned executive district officer, literacy and \nthe  Department  of  Literacy  and  Non-Formal  Education.  The  NGO  will  operate  under  the \ncoordination  of  the  district  project  manager  in  consultation  with  the  district  RSP  and  the \nexecutive district officer, literacy. The selection of skills-based activities to be promoted along \nwith literacy training will be based on proposals made by community organizations to the NGO \nand or the RSP. Training materials prepared under the Non-Formal Primary Education TA will \nbe used to support location- and needs-specific curriculum validation, teacher training in the use \nof this curriculum, as well as institutional linkages, skills development, and illiteracy eradication.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 13\n  5.  Project Implementation and Start-Up \n \n47.  In view of the need for a careful start-up period during which the unions are informed of \nthe project and proposals from villages are assembled, as well as the need for community group \nformation, a rather long project implementation period is necessary, namely 6 years, including 1 \nyear for start-up and 5 years for project implementation. A proposed implementation schedule is \nshown in Appendix 6.  The  Executing  Agency,  ABAD,  has  experience  in  implementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  The  RSPs  all  have  extensive  experience  of  community \norganization and mobilization in rural Pakistan. There is, however, concern by ADB and the \nGovernment that the initiation of the Project will be constrained by the weaknesses that are \nendemic to governance in the context of rural development projects generally in Pakistan, which \ninclude  delays  in  appointing  staff  and  consultants  responsible  for  implementation  and  by \nproblems that may arise as a result of the recent devolution of powers to the district level, in \nview of staff vacancies and lack of a full systems and procedures. Systems and procedures will \nneed to be set up that conform to both the requirements of the government of Punjab and to \nthose of ADB. Within the first 6 months, it will be necessary to have, recruited and operational, a \nfull complement of staff within the PMU, the full team of consultants, and the village and union \norganizers  and  their  supervisors.  During  the  following  6  months,  pilot  activities  will  be \nundertaken in one union in each district to test community mobilization and opportunities for off-\nfarm employment generation.  \n \n48.   Further critical activities to be undertaken during the first year will include the preparation \nof environmental impact assessment and a gender action plan. These will be prepared as a \nbasis to check all proposed interventions under the VUDC for potential impacts and to suggest \npossible mitigation measures if required. \n \n  6.  Procurement \n \n49.  Procurement will be undertaken following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. In terms of \nthe procurement of vehicles and equipment, no large purchases are required. The procurement \nof these items will thus be undertaken using either direct purchase or international shopping \nupon identification of the needs of the implementing agencies. Civil works will be small  to \nmedium scale and scattered, and will thus not be suitable for or of interest to international \ncontractors. Moreover, there is adequate capacity to undertake the works required in a suitable \nmanner and at reasonable cost. Civil works will thus be undertaken through local competitive \nbidding  for  local  companies  or  by  direct  selection  for  beneficiary  user  groups  by  utilizing \ncommunity participation procedures in procurement. In the latter case, disbursement will be on \nthe basis of a statement of expenditures with a portion of the funding being provided by ABAD \nas an initial start-up payment. The procurement packages are in Appendix 7. \n \n  7.  Consulting Services  \n \n50.  The  Project  will  require  support  from  399  person-months  of  consulting  services \ncomprising 42 person months of international consulting services and 357 months of domestic \nconsulting services. International consulting services will include expertise in the management \nof rural development projects, environmental impact screening and mitigation, social and gender \nimpact  screening  and  mitigation,  groundwater  use  and  monitoring,  and  project  financial \nmanagement. Domestic consulting services will consist of specialists in project administration, \ncommunity organization, agriculture, livestock, rural engineering, water conservation, natural \nresource  management,  off-farm  enterprise  development  and  training,  and  facilitating \nmobilization at union level. Consulting services will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \n ", " 14  \nthe Use of Consulting Services and other arrangements for recruitment of domestic consultants \nacceptable to ADB. With the exception of the international project management specialist who \nwill be recruited early on as an individual consultant, international and local consultants and \nunion and district supervisors will be recruited through a firm or an NGO/RSP using the quality \nand cost-based system. In addition, using the quality and cost-based system, ABAD will recruit \nthe services of rural support programs, NGOs, or local consulting companies for the village and \nunion organizers who will work directly in the field with the union administrations, villages, and \ndistrict agencies to provide on the ground support for the VUDC. About 1,080 person-months of \nvillage and union organizer input will be required. Detailed terms of reference for consultants \nand the union organizers are shown in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n  8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n51.  The funds for the ABAD-executed components (targeted poverty alleviation, literacy \nthrough skills training, and institutional and implementation support) will be channeled through \ngovernment budgetary allocations directly from the Department of Finance to the PMU. Funds \nfor these components will then be apportioned to the implementing agency through ABAD. \nProject initiation and implementation will be facilitated through the establishment of an imprest \naccount so that funds will be available and at the disposal of ABAD at the initiation of the \nProject.  For  this  purpose,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  National  Bank  of \nPakistan in Rawalpindi. The initial advance to the imprest account will be based on estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the project or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nDetailed arrangements for the establishment and operation of the imprest accounts will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n52.  The VUDC funds will be transferred directly by the government of Punjab into separate \ndedicated project accounts at the district level. These funds will be disbursed upon the final \nclearance by ABAD of the village and union proposals, after they have been approved by the \ndistrict development committee. The funds will be used to finance the activities of district line \nagencies, contractors, suppliers, or beneficiary groups under the VUDC. For this component, \nimprest accounts will not be required. The government of Punjab has assured that upon loan \neffectiveness and promptly every 6 months thereafter, adequate funds will be transferred for the \nplanned project activities. These expenditures will be reimbursed using standard withdrawal \nprocedures. The statement of expenditures procedure will be used for reimbursing eligible \nexpenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any individual payment transaction up to \n$50,000 equivalent. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the Borrower to the \ngovernment of Punjab on the same terms and conditions as those between ADB and the Borrower. \nThe funds flow chart is shown in  Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n9.  Accounts Audits and Reports \n \n53.  The government of Punjab will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for \nfunds provided to the Project. These accounts and related financial statements will be audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB, and will include an audit with a separate opinion on the \nuse of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. The government of \nPunjab will furnish ADB with the audited accounts and statements not later than 6 months after \nthe end of the related fiscal year. ABAD will submit to ADB, diagnostic quarterly reports detailing \nthe project progress to date, problems encountered, measures taken to overcome them, and \nexpected progress over the next 6 months, as well as any major or serious issues that need to \nbe expeditiously addressed. Six months prior to the completion of the Project, ABAD will submit \na  project  completion  report  to  ADB,  detailing  the  utilization  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \n ", " 15\nimplementation  analysis,  and  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  intended \nbeneficiaries. \n \n10.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n54.  The government of Punjab has provided assurance that all facilities provided under the \nProject  will  be  operated  and  maintained  following  best  practices  within  the  country.  The \ngovernment of Punjab has thus agreed that all proposals from union  must include (i) an \nindication  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  arrangements  to  be  followed  upon \ncompletion of project facilities and (ii) a commitment that these arrangements will be put into \nplace. Where the responsibility lies with the district, provincial, or national government, the \nrespective agency will give a written commitment to accept the responsibility for O&M under its \nregular recurrent budget. Certain investments, for example rural roads and rural electrification, \nhave  established  O&M  procedures.  In  recent  years,  under  the  Medium  Term  Budgetary \nFramework (2004/5\u20132007/8), an increasing and dedicated recurrent budget has been provided \nfor  infrastructure  and  O&M  benchmarks  have  also  been  upgraded.  Furthermore  any  rural \nelectrification scheme linked to the national grid becomes part of the operational responsibility of \nthe regional power board and will be maintained according to national standards. Other facilities \nwill be operated and maintained according to best practices within their particular sector. Where \npossible this will entail operation by the beneficiaries using their own funding. \n \n  11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n55.  An ongoing project performance management system (PPMS) will be established within \n1  year  of  loan  effectiveness.  A  specific  position  on  the  PMU  has  been  designated  for  a \nmonitoring specialist and this person, with support from consultants, will ensure the operation of \nthe PPMS throughout the project period. At the beginning of the Project and not later than 6 \nmonths of loan effectiveness, specific indicators will be identified and further firmed up as a \nbasis for implementation and monitoring. A database of information will be established at ABAD \nand consist of information collected at all stages, including baseline, surveys, subproject profiles \n(at initiation), annual monitoring surveys, impact studies, etc. Day to day monitoring of the \nVUDC  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  concerned  union  council  through  its  monitoring \ncommittees. Implementation monitoring for the targeted poverty alleviation component will be \ndone by the RSPs themselves following their standard procedures. A framework for monitoring \nliteracy through skills training component will be developed in consultation with RSPs, locally \nrecruited  NGOs,  and  participants  of  the  literacy  program  who  in  turn  will  also  provide \nrecommendations for indicators to be developed for tracking the usefulness of training in further \ndeveloping  market-oriented  skills  and  institutional  linkages.  For  further  details  see \nSupplementary Appendix J.  \n \n12.  Project Review \n \n56.  ABAD  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  project  review  semiannually.  After  3  years  of \nimplementation, a full midterm review will be undertaken, which will include a comprehensive \nevaluation of the project implementation arrangements and project progress to date. It will \ninclude  consultations  with  the  district  development  committee,  line  agencies,  union \nadministrations, council members, and targeted beneficiaries. If necessary, recommendations \nwill be made for adjustments to the project scope, implementation arrangements, and cost \nestimates. \n \n \n ", " 16  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n57.  General. The Project will enhance the livelihood and quality of life of about 350,000 \nhouseholds living in the rural areas of 200 disadvantaged and poor unions in Punjab, which \nhave marginal natural resource endowments and weak social and institutional capacities. Direct \nincome enhancement will be achieved by increased access to markets and inputs for crop \nagriculture and livestock production; improved access to water for crop irrigation (including the \nproduction of fodder crops), livestock watering, and domestic supplies; the improvement of \nrangelands and pastures; the provision of access to electricity to allow for a variety of productive \nactivities, including off-farm enterprises and access to improved agriculture techniques and \ntechnologies especially adapted to arid conditions. In addition, poorer groups in the project area \n(about 70,000 households) will be specially targeted for programs that foster income enhancing \nactivities through training in new skills, access to credit, small-scale communal infrastructure, \nand the provision of social support through schools and health posts. \n \n58.  Governance and Institutional Aspects. The Project, in its mobilization efforts, will aim \nto  support  and  strengthen  the  current  move  to  devolution  as  promulgated  under  the  Local \nGovernment Ordinance of 2001. It will orient communities to deal with the various service delivery \ndepartments and make them aware that they do not need to seek patronage and favors of the \nstrong or influential when operating as a collectivity. It will further strengthen the new institutions \nat  the  union  and  district  level  in  the  project  area  to  make  them  responsive  to  identified \ncommunity needs. These interventions can positively impact on service delivery structures and \nmechanisms  for  rural  infrastructure,  water  management  and  conservation,  rural  electrification, \nagriculture extension, livestock production, primary education and health, and improve quality of life \nand access to markets and opportunities for the population of the barani areas. \n \n59.  Poverty, Gender, and Participation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis provided in Appendix 8. It is the overall intent of the Project that it should have a positive \nsocial impact on the population of the project area through poverty alleviation, an improvement \nin the status of women, increases in rural employment possibilities and household incomes, \nincreases in rates of literacy, increases in the general health of the population, and a general \nimprovement  in  the  quality  of  life.  The  Project  is  not  only  designed  to  provide  improved \ninfrastructure to the populations of some of the poorest and most deprived villages in the \ncountry,  but  also  to  specifically  target  poor  segments  of  the  population  and  deprived  and \nunderprivileged groups. The Project will have widespread positive impact on the lives of poor \nand vulnerable inhabitants of the barani areas\u2014small farmers or herders, the landless, and \nwomen and children. The overall implementation and delivery modalities being proposed for the \nProject will contribute to and social development, and minimize asset inequalities generated by \nthe ability of the local elite to influence public expenditure. The involvement of local NGOs, and \nprovincial and national RSPs staffed with an adequate gender balance, will enable the Project to \nwork with organized community groups and utilize the necessary range of targeting methods to \nreach  specific  population  groups  and  individual  households,  reduce  social  barriers,  and \nmaximize the positive impact on women.  \n \n60.  Project  activities  identified,  designed,  and  implemented  by  communities,  including \nwomen, according to their needs and circumstances will improve food security and nutrition, \naccess  to  productive  resources  and  goods  and  services,  skills  and  knowledge,  and  the \nawareness of rights and the ability to exercise those rights, among the poor and excluded. \nWomen will be drawn into the mainstream by their involvement in support activities for livestock \n ", " 17\ndevelopment and in the layout and management of domestic water supply schemes. Adult \nliteracy and skills development for women will positively impact on their self-esteem and status. \nIndirectly, the advocacy of literate women will help ensure the enrollment of girls in schools. \nConsistent with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples, no plan for indigenous peoples needs to \nbe prepared, as all groups will equally benefit from project interventions. \n \n61.  Resettlement.  The  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  include  small-  to \nmedium-scale investments that are selected by the beneficiaries in a demand-driven process. \nExamples include rural access roads built upon existing dirt tracks, village electrification, small \nwater conveyance structures, and range improvements. The scale and nature of the activities \nare such that those that might potentially be affected by access ways will almost always be \nthose directly benefiting from the investment. No involuntary resettlement effects are foreseen \nbecause  the  beneficiaries  themselves  will  be  involved  in  identifying,  designing,  and \nimplementing the subproject activities. The Government has provided an assurance that any \nsubprojects that may involve involuntary resettlement would not be included within the scope of \nthe Project. \n \n62.  Environmental Impact. As most of the proposed project interventions will be small to \nmedium scale and spread over a large area, significant environmental impacts are not expected \nas a result of the Project. No significant impacts are expected from the rural infrastructure \ninterventions  since  existing  rights-of-way  will  be  used  for  any  road  improvements  or  the \nupgrading of walking trails to jeepable tracks. Similarly, rural electrification is not expected to \nhave any significant impacts on the environment through which low kilovolt power lines are \nconstructed.  Most  agricultural  or  livestock  interventions  will  be  environmentally  positive, \nresulting  in  enhanced  ground  cover  or  improved  pasture.  Water  storage  or  conservation \ninterventions may have positive effects by reducing erosion (which is a very serious problem in \nthe barani areas). Large amounts of fertilizer or pesticide are not used on barani crops due to \nthe risk of crop losses or crop failure, thus the overuse of agro-chemicals as a result of project \ninterventions is also considered unlikely. Several possible and suggested interventions depend \non the use of groundwater either for irrigation, livestock, or domestic water supply. In using the \ngroundwater resource, there is a risk of both overexploitation resulting in the nonsustainable \ndepletion  of  the  resource  and  overuse  in  inappropriate  soils,  resulting  in  salinization  or \nsodicization. An important part of the terms of reference of the water conservation consultant \nwill thus be to check the status of the groundwater resource in the project area and to provide \nguidelines on groundwater use to the districts, unions, and RSPs prior to the identification of \npossible project interventions at the village level. As an additional check on environmental \nconcerns, a consultant will be recruited at the initiation of the Project to prepare guidelines and \nprovide training on environmental screening for proposed interventions for the VUDC. Full-time \nenvironmental specialists will be recruited as part of the project management unit to ensure that \nthe screening takes place for each proposed project activity. A summary initial environmental \nexamination of a typical subproject is attached in Appendix 9. Environmental assessment review \nprocedures are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n63.  Economic and Financial Analysis. Investments to be supported by the Project follow a \ndemand-driven,  process  approach.  The  main  beneficiaries  will  be  the  farmers,  landless \nlaborers, the unemployed and/or underemployed, livestock holders, women, and children. The \nproject interventions pursue both efficiency and equity objectives. The economic analysis is \nbased on indicative model budgets of potential interventions, which include agriculture and \nnatural resource management, small-scale community infrastructure, and literacy and skills \ntraining. The indicative models assess quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs and benefits, \n ", " 18  \nimpact on income and poverty, economic viability, and distribution. A more detailed discussion \nof the economic and financial analysis is presented in Appendix 10.20  \n \n64.  There are ranges of economic internal rates of return (EIRR) for the subprojects, with \nmost clustering near 20% or higher. Sensitivity analysis shows that most EIRRs remain robust \nwhen subprojects are subjected to price fluctuations, decreases in benefits, or cost overruns. \nBased on representative farm models, most increases in income are between PRs2,000 and \nPRs9,000 per hectare annually. Though each subproject varies in term of its distribution of \nbenefits, it is anticipated that most benefits will accrue to the poor, especially small farmers. It is \nestimated that 70% of the benefits from irrigation and natural resource management will go to \nsmall farmers. Most of the project interventions are labor intensive, and hence will require both \nskilled and unskilled labor during implementation. The Project will also generate demand for \nseasonal labor commensurate with the increases in crop and livestock productivity and other \nrelated  economic  activities  (transport  and  rural  electrification).  Project  support  for  skills \nenhancement will encourage the labor force to train for gainful employment, facilitate reduction \nof unemployment and contribute to household income.  \n \n65.  Sustainability. Two particular factors provide confidence that the project interventions \nwill be sustainable. First, the subprojects will be beneficiary-selected and involve contributions \nby beneficiaries of time and investment. A formalized, well-defined plan and commitment to \nO&M is a prerequisite for pursuing most subprojects. Beneficiaries, who are involved from \ndesign  onward,  will  be  motivated  to  ensure  that  project  facilities  are  well  maintained  and \nfunctional.  Second,  some  of  the  larger  investments,  for  example  rural  roads  and  rural \nelectrification, have established O&M procedures. Rural roads are maintained by the district \ngovernments and, in recent years under the devolution process, increasing funds have been \nallocated specifically for O&M. Furthermore, rural electrification schemes linked to the national \ngrid  become  part  of  the  operational  responsibility  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority and will be maintained according to national standards.21  \n \nB.  Risks  \n \n66.  The major risks for the Project include: (i) lack of capacity of district line agencies; \n(ii) lack  of  accountability  at  the  district-level  institutions;  (iii) lack  of  capacity  in  community \nmobilization;  (iv) insufficient  monitoring  capacity  for  tracking  the  widespread  subprojects; \n(v) lack  of  social,  gender,  and  environmental  safeguards;  (vi) political  influence  and \nappropriation of project activities; and (vii) deficient O&M. For item (i), the Project provides for a \nspecific budget for line agency support in implementation. In pursuit of accountability (item ii), \nthe  design  has  involved  a  number  of  independent  participants  and  institutions  in \nimplementation; the flow of funds for VUDC is through the government system and within the \npurview of the Department of Finance; under local devolution, monitoring committees have been \nestablished; and, finally, mobilized community organizations are to act as concerned interest \n                                                 \n20 Supplementary Appendix E provides further details on the analyses of subproject investments and possible impact \non beneficiaries. \n21 The project performance audit report for the Second Punjab Barani Area Development Project confirmed that the \nrural roads improved under that project continue to be well maintained and in good condition. The PPAR also \nconfirms that irrigation facilities provided under that project were well maintained by the owners and that buildings \nand equipment, which were transferred to the Government\u2019s regular budget after project completion, continue to be \nwell maintained. \n \n \n ", " 19\ngroups. For enhancing capacity in community organization (item iii), the Project has cultivated \nthe participation of RSPs. These institutions already have well-established programs, staff, \nprocedures,  and  monitoring  systems.  Also,  because  of  their  size  and  reputation,  these \ninstitutions can (i) resist local political pressures to sway activities, and (ii) advocate on behalf of \nthe communities if difficulties arise. For monitoring (item iv), the Project provides adequate \nconsultancy  services,  staff  resources,  and  a  realistic  framework.  For  social,  gender,  and \nenvironmental safeguards (item v), consultants are engaged early to establish a framework for \nscreening subprojects. To counter political interference (item vi), there are defined subproject \nselection criteria and a range of participants involved in the project process. Concerns over \nO&M (item vii) are addressed by requiring upfront beneficiary contribution supplemented by \nclearly defined agreements between communities and responsible agencies.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n67.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that within one year of the loan effectiveness all \nrelevant vacant posts in key district line agencies within project area will be filled \nwith full-time staff.  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  Punjab  will  transfer  funds  for  the  planned \nactivities under the VUDC subject to the fulfillment by project districts and their \nrespective  unions of the eligibility criteria under Appendix 11. The Government \nwill also ensure that Punjab will transfer in a timely manner adequate counterpart \nfunds to ABAD in its annual budget to implement effectively the components \nunder the Project other than VUDC. \n(iii)  The Government will establish within one year of loan effectiveness a PPMS. \nThe Government will ensure that within 6 months of loan effectiveness the PMU \nwill develop criteria for monitoring project implementation and project impact. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the PMU will be fully staffed within one month of \nloan effectiveness. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the activities proposed for the VUDC will only \nbe approved if the beneficiaries and union concerned clearly indicate the degree \nof beneficiary contribution. The beneficiaries and the union must indicate the \narrangements of the operation and maintenance of the scheme proposed and \nprovide  written  commitments  on  their  willingness  to  comply  with  these \narrangements.  \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that within six months of loan effectiveness Punjab \nwill develop appropriate framework for the operation and maintenance of all \ninvestments made under VUDC. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that Punjab will develop the selection criteria for the \ninterventions to be financed under the targeted poverty alleviation component \nwithin one month of the loan effectiveness. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  land  to  be  utilized  for  this  Project,  where \npossible, will not involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts, including loss of income, resources, or assets \nfor  the  nontitled.  Accordingly,  any  subproject  that  may  involve  involuntary \nresettlement would not be included within the scope of the Project. \n ", " 20  \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified \nin the initial environmental examination are incorporated into the Project design \nand implemented in accordance with the Borrower\u2019s environmental laws and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. \n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  the  timely  development  and  effective \nimplementation  of  the  Gender  Action  Plan  to  ensure  the  equitable  and  full \nparticipation of women in Project activities.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n68.  The following were agreed upon as conditions for effectiveness of the loan after Board \napproval: \n \n(i)  The project steering committee will have been formally established. \n(ii)  Approved arrangements for the flow of project funding are in place between the \nprovincial government and the district governments.  \n(iii)  The  approval  by  government  of  Punjab  of  the  procedures  and  criteria  for \nactivities under the VUDC has been obtained. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 27,207,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sustainable \nLivelihoods in Barani Areas Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n23 November 2004 \n \n ", "Appendix 1          21     \nTHE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND THE BARANI SUBSECTOR \n \nA.  The Agriculture Sector \n \n1.  Agriculture  remains  the  backbone  of  Pakistan\u2019s  economy.  Agricultural  production \naccounts for 23.3% of gross domestic product, 42% of employment, and 70% of exports. It is \nalso the largest source of foreign exchange earnings. Moreover, agriculture supplies 60% of the \nraw materials for the industry sector, primarily cotton, sugar, wool, and leather, and comprises a \nsubstantial market for industrial products in the form of machinery and agricultural inputs and \nmaterials.  \n \n2.  Due to the country\u2019s generally arid climate, over 90% of the total crop output comes from \nirrigated land. One of the country\u2019s main attributes is its large and extensive canal irrigation \nnetwork, comprising one of the largest irrigated systems in the world.  This network, along with a \ntropical/subtropical climate and relatively fertile soils, represents a productive asset and the \ncountry\u2019s main economic base. Major crops produced include wheat, cotton, rice, sugarcane, \nand fodder crops; however, the country has recently begun moving to higher value crops such \nas citrus and other fruits for export. Through a combination of development efforts and improved \ntechnology (primarily the use of high yielding varieties and fertilizers), Pakistan attained food \nself-sufficiency in the 1980s but has since struggled to maintain this situation due to a lack of \nprice incentives and a continually increasing population.  \n \n3.  A major component of the agriculture sector is the livestock subsector, which accounts \nfor about 49% of value added in the sector and 11.4% of gross domestic product. Almost all \nrural households raise livestock and this accounts for some 30\u201340% of household income on \naverage. The livestock population consists of cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, horses, \ndonkeys and mules. Livestock production is important in both irrigated and nonirrigated areas \nbut tends to play a more critical role in nonirrigated areas. However, the production of fodder \ncrops and poultry feed constitutes an increasingly important aspect of irrigated agriculture. \n \n4.  Overall, agricultural growth has been unimpressive over the past decade or so. While \nneighboring countries have been growing more rapidly, Pakistan\u2019s agricultural growth during the \n1990s averaged about only 3%, staying just ahead of average population growth of 2.5%. \nMoreover, a particularly serious drought lasting from late 2001 to 2003 had a significantly \nnegative impact on the sector in 2001 and 2002, despite the fact that most of the country\u2019s \nagriculture is irrigated. The agriculture sector suffered declines of 2.7% in 2001 and 0.1% in \n2002.1 There was, however, a recovery in 2003, with growth up by 4.1%, albeit from the \nreduced drought production levels.  \n \n5.  Constraints on growth in the sector include imperfections in land markets and land \ndistribution (including a high degree of fragmentation); inefficiencies in irrigation management \nincluding excessive losses and inequitable distribution; deterioration in land quality due to poor \nirrigation practices; an inadequate rural transport network resulting in limited access to inputs \nand to markets; inefficiencies as a result of public sector involvement in input and output \nmarkets; and restricted access to credit by small farmers.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Pakistan. 2004.

These constitute about one quarter \nof the cultivated land area of the country, but account for only 10% of crop production. These \nlands are very diverse and range from upland mountain areas to lowland, semidesert areas at \nthe fringes of, or out of reach of, the canal-irrigated command areas. In some cases, especially \nin the north, sufficient water is available for annual cropping. While in others, drought resistant \ncrops predominate, and yet in others, crops are planted on a speculative basis and abandoned \nor used as fodder for livestock if rains are insufficient to bring the crop to maturity.  \n \n7.  The crops grown and the cropping patterns in barani areas also differ from irrigated \nareas. Minor, drought-resistant crops such as chickpea, peanut, and oilseeds are common. In \ntwo  of  the  proposed  project  districts,  the  barani  areas  account  for  80%  of  the  chickpea \nproduction of the whole province. Drought-resistant wheat is also tried where sufficient moisture \nis available, especially in the more northerly areas. Livestock accounts for a much larger portion \nof household income than in irrigated areas, estimated at about 70% by the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance consultants. \n \n8.  While some barani areas now have some access to water through tube wells and small \nwater conservation structures (such as small dams), the dependency on rainfall and thus the \nsusceptibility to drought is much greater than in irrigated areas. Farming on barani lands is thus \na much more precarious occupation than farming within the irrigated command areas. The most \nrecent 2001\u20132003 drought had a devastating effect on many barani areas, especially those in \nthe more arid regions. In some districts of Punjab, the barani crop has failed for 3 years in a \nrow, resulting in forced migration to urban areas, serious indebtedness, and the impoverishment \nof many families that had previously enjoyed incomes above the poverty line. Fortunately a \nsignificant amount of family incomes in the barani areas has traditionally come from remittances \nand this source of income has served to prevent abject famine or dire poverty. \n \n9.  More optimistically, agricultural production in barani areas over the past two decades \nhas  shown  some  advances.  Through  public  sector  development  efforts  and  private  sector \ninitiatives, access to water has shown some improvement through small-scale irrigation, small to \nmedium  water-storage  structures,  groundwater  use,  and  water-conservation  practices.  In \naddition, access and egress from barani areas to markets and services has been improved. As \na result, in some parts of the barani areas there has also been an increase in the production of \nhigh value crops such fruit trees and short-season vegetables, which are now more easily \nmarketed in nearby urban areas. The future for barani agriculture is thus not entirely bleak. \nHowever, production will always be precarious as long as water is in short supply and rainfall \nuncertain.  Since  there  is  no  way  that  all  barani  lands  can  be  covered  by  small-scale  or \ngroundwater irrigation, the risks of barani farming will always be higher than for farming within \nthe irrigated command areas. \n \nC.  Government Plans and Policies \n \n10.  The Economic Advisory Board of the Ministry of Finance prepared an Economic Revival \nProgram in 2001 in which it was recognized that increasing growth in agriculture will assure \nsignificant poverty alleviation in rural areas. In addition, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and \nLivestock (MINFAL) has prepared a paper entitled \u201dAgriculture Strategies for the First Decade of \nthe New Millennium,\u201d which recognizes that agricultural production has stagnated and is no \nlonger keeping pace with population growth. In response, the strategy paper sets goals of \nachieving an annual production rate of 5% and achieving food security and self-reliance by \n ", "Appendix 1         23  \n2010. The most recent (initiated in December 2003) articulation of the strategy was reflected in \nthe Punjab Economic Report prepared by the government of Punjab with assistance from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and Department for International Development. \nThe objective of the report is to provide an analytical and policy underpinning for Punjab\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy. The overriding concern is to provide a better life for the province\u2019s \ncitizens. In the short to medium term, the provision of this better life depends essentially on two \nconsiderations. First, incomes must be increased; second, the delivery of public services must \nbe improved. It is recognized that agriculture is a major contributor to Punjab\u2019s economy, \naccounting for roughly 28% of its output and providing direct employment to over 40% of the \nworkforce. While total employment in agriculture has stagnated during the past decade, more \nefficient  utilization  of  Punjab\u2019s  public  resources  and  abundant  natural  endowments,  in \ncombination with measures to promote agricultural diversification away from cereal crops to \nother more labor-intensive activities, can help unlock this sector\u2019s tremendous employment-\ngeneration potential. Allocation of public resources to and within the sector is one of the major \nways  that  the  government  of  Punjab  can  influence  growth  and  employment  generation  in \nagriculture. In order to reverse the decline in total public expenditures in agriculture as well as \nimprove the composition of public spending in this sector, the report, among other things, \nrecommends that the provincial government should increase public investment, particularly on \nwater management and research; rationalize public spending on agriculture support services; \nfocus on pedigree registration systems, capacity building, and strengthening of private breeder \nassociations, as well as control of livestock disease epidemics; and improve cost recovery, in \nconjunction with devolution to user associations. The report recommends a sustained focus on \nintegrated pest management in view of the environmental and health problems associated with \nthe high levels of pesticides used. \n \n11.  Other aspects covered relate to rationalizing the wheat procurement and storage policy, \nmodernizing wholesale markets, and improving functioning of land and water markets. Finally, \nthe  report  reinforces  the  view  that  a  strong  agricultural  innovation  system  is  critical  to \nmodernizing agriculture, as a large part of future productivity gains and of quality enhancement. \nDiversification must be provided through generation, adaptation, and dissemination of new \ntechnologies and information. The report recommends establishment by the Government of a \ncompetitive fund to support high priority research, providing operating costs to research by \nallocation on a competitive basis. The report recognizes that in translating these into reality, an \nimportant challenge in view of recent devolution and past performance will be to tackle the \ncapacity and institutional constraints.  \n \n12.  To specifically address issues in the barani areas of Punjab, a ministerial committee was \nconstituted by Punjab\u2019s chief minister in March 2004, and measures are being identified to \nenhance agricultural productivity and improve livelihoods in the barani areas to address the \nspecific needs of the diverse agro-ecological zones in the barani areas of Punjab. In support of \nthese needs-based initiatives, a series of interventions are being made to introduce participatory \napproaches in crop production, with a focus on quality seed and improved varieties, access to \nbetter  quality  animal-breeding  stock,  improved  management  of  rangelands,  water  resource \ndevelopment, and infrastructure.   \n  \nD.  Asian Development Bank Strategy \n \n13.  The  focus  of  the  current  country  strategy  and  program  is  on  supporting  poverty \nalleviation through provision of assistance in the key economic areas of good governance, \nsustainable  pro-poor  economic  growth,  and  inclusive  social  development.  Under  good \ngovernance the country strategy and program emphasizes successful implementation of recent \n ", "24          Appendix 1 \ngovernance reforms, especially devolution of powers to local governments. ADB is actively \ninvolved in this effort through its support for the Decentralization Support Program.2  \n \n14.   With specific respect to agriculture and rural development, ADB strategy aims at increased \nagricultural  growth  rates  and  enhanced  exports  of  agricultural  commodities,  leading  to  a \nreduction in the proportion of the rural population living in absolute poverty being reduced by \none half through rapid income growth and a reduction in food and human poverty. This is to be \nachieved through the support of a series of rural development, livelihood enhancement, water \nsector  projects  and  agriculture  and  agribusiness  development  investments  targeted  at  the \npoorer  areas  of  the  country.  Through  the  ADB  Agriculture  Sector  Program  Loan  II,3  the \nGovernment, including the government of Punjab, is moving toward market-based agricultural \noutput and has decided to phase out price supports and subsidies while at the same time \npromoting  increased  exports,  private  competition,  and  joint  farmer  storage  and  marketing \nactivities. Through this process ADB has maintained a sustained dialogue with all the four \nprovinces and Punjab in order to facilitate the development of consistent policy by laying out a \nframework for intervention that defines a tolerable level of price variability, minimizes fiscal \noutlays, minimizes distortions to long-run market equilibrium prices, maximizes private sector \nparticipation and competitive markets, and ensures that the poorest are the major beneficiaries \nof fiscal expenditures. \n \nE.  Lessons Learned \n \n15.  Over the past two decades, ADB has been involved in a number of rural development \nprojects in Pakistan, some of which focused on barani areas and others which covered both \nbarani  and  irrigated  areas.  Most  rural  development  projects  in  the  country  have  been \nconsidered generally successful in achieving an improved standard of living in the rural areas \nbeing  targeted.  On  the  other  hand,  most  have  also  had  some  type  of  implementation  or \nsustainability issues. \n \n16.  Experience from past projects has repeatedly shown that a participatory, demand-driven \napproach is important for targeting the poor, providing appropriate interventions, imparting cost-\neffective  solutions,  and  ensuring  sustainability.  It  has  also  been  demonstrated  that \n(i) implementing a project in a poor region does not have an automatic impact on poverty \nalleviation unless specific measures are taken to target the poor; (ii) weak targeting criteria and \nnonadherence to the targeting resulted in failure to reach the poor (small farmers, landless, and \npoor women); (iii) lack of a gender sensitive approach leading to limited outreach to women; \n(iv) inadequate extension training focused on women engaged in livestock rearing; (v) landless \npoor women remained excluded from rural credit; (vi) development projects were identified by \noutsiders  without  involvement  of  the  intended  beneficiaries;  (vii) selection  of  infrastructure \nprojects was reportedly influenced by political interests; (viii) there was inadequate attention on \nbuilding sustainable institutions and community organizations, as well as a lack of community \nownership of the project. Experience of other international financing agencies such as the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development and Department for International Development \nalso indicates that lack of poverty focus of the line agencies and the poor delivery of appropriate \nservices to the resource-poor has also been a major issue in achieving project objectives. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n3  ADB 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II. Manila.  \n \n ", "Appendix 1         25  \nThese are in addition to the concerns relating to lack of gender awareness in service delivery, \nand  inadequate  focus  on  environmental  safeguards  and  sustainability  of  investments. \nInsufficient focus and overly complicated monitoring and evaluation systems have also been \nidentified in the projects financed by ADB and other development partners. If rural development \nprojects are to be responsive they must be flexible enough to meet a range of beneficiary \nconcerns  and  the  management  system  should  be  decentralized  so  that  project  staff,  line \nagencies, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs)/rural support programs (RSPs) can work \nin concert in the field to respond to actual needs. Communities are generally diverse and their \nneeds vary. No standard package can be designed to fit all. If the directions are set from the \ngrassroots and the service providers respond with a range of simple, low-cost technologies and \ninterventions, then the planning and coordination effort is minimized, especially if the project \nmanagement has a good degree of autonomy and is situated relatively close to the communities \nit serves. Close collaboration between line agencies and social mobilizers from RSPs and \nNGOs is critical if appropriate and relevant intervention packages have to be designed for the \nresource-poor communities implemented and sustained. Simplified and participatory monitoring \nand evaluation processes are critical to support effective and institutionalized monitoring and \nevaluation processes.    \n \nF.  Project Interventions in Agriculture \n \n17.  The Project will work to strengthen livelihood in agriculture and livestock. Pilots will be \nundertaken  for  a  range  of  measures  to  be  replicated,  as  communities  deem  worthy.  In \nagriculture, the following will be prospects for farmers: improved seed supply, applied research, \nstrengthened  extension,  and  better  on-farm  water  management.  In  livestock,  breed \nimprovement, and better veterinary services and husbandry practices will be options. In natural \nresource management, rangeland and pastures development, community afforestation, and soil \nand water conservation will be possibilities for villagers. \n \n18.  A series of interventions designed under other ongoing projects in the barani areas are \nappropriate for the Project. These include participatory approaches in crop production, with a \nfocus on quality seed and improved varieties, access to better quality breeding stock, improved \nmanagement of rangelands, and a range of interventions in water resource conservation and \ndevelopment. Provision has also been made to facilitate, on a competitive basis through well-\narticulated proposals, collaboration between district technical staff and provincial institutions, \nsuch  as  research  services  that  are  charged  with  development  and  validation  of  new \ninterventions. Within extension, the Project will attempt to build on and replicate successes in \nrecent years in the National Integrated Pest Management Programme (NIPMP).4 This program \nhas inculcated integrated crop management via through farmer field schools (FFS). This is an \neco-system approach to agriculture that takes into account a broad range environmental factors \nrather than just pests, including beneficial organisms, other-plant hosts, weather, weeds, water, \nnutrients, and soil. Integrated crop management does not mean \"no pesticides\", but entails \nconsidering a range of other cultural factors before turning to expensive and potentially harmful \nagrochemicals.  The FFS approach to technology transfer is learner-centered and differs from \ntraditional, top-down extension methods. Facilitated farmer learning, rather than instruction, is \nthe focus. The goal of FFS is to empower farmers with knowledge, management skills, and \nconfidence  so  that  they  can  ultimately  make  informed,  rational  decisions  concerning  crop \nmanagement  and  pest  control.  In  pilot  areas  in  Punjab  and  Sindh,  the  NIPMP  has  been \npopularly  accepted  and  appreciated  in  rural  communities.  The  national  and  provincial \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Integrated Pest Management. Manila.  \n ", "26          Appendix 1 \ngovernments have also taken notice and committed resources to expanding the pilot program. \nSee Supplementary Appendix G for further details. \n \n19.  In conclusion, agriculture in barani areas poses a number of unique opportunities and \nconstraints. Through a menu of options to be made available under the Project, village-farming \ncommunities will be active in establishing demand-driven, participatory approaches to improving \nagricultural  livelihoods.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  lasting  community  and  government \ncapacities to realize resource potential. \n ", " Appendix 2            27        \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \nProject  Funding Agencies  Amount  Approval \n  ($ million)  Year \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector  ADB  152.0  2003 \nDevelopment Program  \n \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector  ADB  18.0  2003 \nDevelopment Program (Project Loan) \n \nDecentralization Support Program  ADB  205  2002 \n \nRural Finance Sector Development Program  ADB  225.0  2002 \n(Program Loan) \n \nRural Finance Sector Development Program  ADB  25.0  2002 \n(Project Loan) \n \nSindh Rural Development Project  ADB  50.0  2002 \n       \nAgriculture Sector Program Loan IIa  ADB  350.0  2001 \n \nNorth-West Frontier Province Barani Area  ADB, IFAD  52.0  2000 \nDevelopment Project\u2014Phase II   \nSouth FATA Development Project  IFAD   17.0  2000 \n \nBajaur Area Development Project  NAS  4.0  2000 \nMohmand Area Development Project  NAS    2000 \n \nKhyber Area Development Project  NAS    2000 \n \nMalakand Rural Development Project  ADB  41.0  1999 \n \nBarani Village Development Project (Punjab)  IFAD   15.3  1999 \n \nDir Area Support Project   IFAD   13.0  1997 \n \nDera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project  ADB  36.0  1997 \n \nBahawalpur Rural Development Project  ADB, Islamic  45.0  1996 \nDevelopment Bank \n \nNorth-West Frontier Province Barani Area  ADB  32.8  1992 \nDevelopment Project \n \nMansehra Village Support Project  IFAD   14.5  1992 \n \nKalam Integrated Rural Development Project,  Swiss Agency for  3.5  1992 \nNWFP (Phase IV)  Development \nCooperation \n \nSupport to Neelum and Jhelum Valleys  IFAD  5.8  1991 \nCommunity Development Project \n \nSecond Barani Area Development (Punjab)  ADB  25.0  1990 \n \nSupport For the Rural Population in Chitral  European Community  10.1  1990 \nDistrict \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FATA = Federally Administered Tribal Areas, IFAD = International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development, NAS = Narcotics Affairs Section of the United States Embassy, NWFP = \nNorth-West Frontier Province. \na  Loan 1877\u2014$123.0 million; Loan 1878\u2014$225.00 million; Loan 1879\u2014$2.0 million. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n ", "28          Appendix 3 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nIndicators/Targets  Risks \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe rural sector of Pakistan plays a critical role in the economic development of the country. Agriculture contributes \nabout 23.3% of gross domestic product and provides direct employment to 42% of the workforce. Poverty in Pakistan \nhas a significant rural dimension linked closely to the economic health of the agriculture sector. The number of poor1 in \nPakistan more than doubled in the 1990s as poverty levels increased with the number of poor rising to 45 million in \n1999, of whom 33 million or 73% (4.7 million households) are estimated to live in rural areas. Moreover, Pakistan \nranks poorly in major social indicators: infant mortality in rural areas is 83 per 1,000 live births; malnutrition of children \nunder 5 is 38%. \nAn important feature of poverty in Pakistan is the clustering of incomes around the poverty line, as 40.5% of the \nnation\u2019s population was in a narrow income range around this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total population may \nbe classed as chronically or extremely poor. According to a Social Policy Development Centre assessment, in the \n1990s, over a 10-year period the disposable income of the top income quintile grow in real terms by 23%, while that of \nthe lowest quintile grew by 3%, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor.2 Factors that affect the livelihood of \nthe poor include (i) low literacy; (ii) lack of access to appropriate technologies, government extension services, off-\nfarm employment opportunities, and formal credit; (iii) social exclusion; (iv) gender discrimination; (v) exclusion from \nthe benefits of development projects; and (vi) poor service delivery. \nThe Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a poverty partnership agreement \n(PPA) that captures the key priorities for poverty alleviation. The need to target the poor to reduce inequalities as well \nas improvement in agriculture and rural development are important components of the PPA. The long-term poverty \nalleviation strategy interventions are focused on governance reforms to promote efficient, equitable, and accountable \nuse of resources; and agriculture and rural development programs to increase productivity, diversification, and \nsustainable use of natural resources, particularly water and cultivable land. Past development project experiences3 \nhave shown that lack of resources, lack of participation of poor households and local communities in designing \ndevelopment  projects,  inappropriate  targeting  of  beneficiaries,  inadequate  human  development  effort,  and \nmismanagement and other governance issues resulted in poor service delivery. Participation of various stakeholders \nincluding local communities, poor, government agencies, civil society, and good governance at the grassroots level is \ncritical for any poverty alleviation program.  \nIn Punjab 36.3% of the rural population lives below the poverty line. These high levels of poverty in rural areas tie in \nclosely with particularly low growth rates in the agriculture sector over the past decade. Growth in agricultural gross \ndomestic product has been below 5% for most of the 1990s and due to a prolonged and serious drought dropped into \nnegative figures in 2001 and 2002. The unirrigated barani areas suffered much more severely as a result of the \ndrought than the canal-irrigated areas. Poor yields or complete crop failures forced many farmers into debt and to \nabandon their lands during this period. \n \n                                                 \n1  The official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories/day/adult, equivalent to PRs750 per month in 2002.

Agriculture is the most \nwidespread source of income (61%) in the project districts.5 The Pakistan Integrated Household Survey [ 2001\u201302] \ndata indicates that the poorer districts are more dependent on agricultural income than the relatively well-off districts. \nCash income is supplemented through daily wages and livestock (over 70% households owned livestock). The project \ndistricts are ranked according to their poverty levels based on a number of economic and social indicators including \nagriculture, services, education, health, roads and transport, housing, and sewerage. Data on level of poverty in the \nproject area indicate that 8% of the respondents were very poor, 32% poor, and 25% lower-middle-income group. \nFarm sizes are small across the project area. Farm size less than 1 hectare (ha) is considered below subsistence level \nin the barani area and 39.8% households own less than 1 ha of land. The average income of a livestock rearer is \nPRs2, 100 per month, which is half of the monthly average income of a household in the project area. The educational \nstatus of the households is very low. The 1998 population census data indicate that 48.9% of the rural population of 5 \nyears and above had never attended school. \nThe monthly income levels in the project area varies substantially between districts, but even for the most developed \ngroup\u2014 Gujrat, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, and Sialkot\u2014it is only PRs6,510 whereas for the least developed districts\u2014\nBhakkar, Chakwal, Khushab, Layyah, and Mianwali\u2014it is PRs4,795.6 The average monthly income of the household \nwas PRs5,954 in 2001/02. According to the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey data, the poorest rural households \nacross the project area had only between 40% and 55% of average incomes.  \nIn sum, some of the main reasons for poverty in the barani area include small landholdings, significant landlessness, \ninadequate rainfall, low crop yields and natural resource degradation. Periods of drought are a major risk to pastoral \nand agricultural livelihood and a source of vulnerability for the poor, particularly in the southern districts. The poor and \nexcluded of barani Punjab, like many elsewhere, are characterized by conditions of low food security and nutrition, \npoor  access  to  goods,  services,  skills,  knowledge,  and  productive  resources\u2014particularly  water\u2014and  a  low \nawareness of their rights and the ability to exercise those rights.  \nPrevious public development investment in the barani areas, through several projects in the past decades, have not \nbeen able to  have  a meaningful  impact  on the  poor  small farmers/herders, the landless and  women. These \ninvestments may have even contributed to asset inequalities generated by the ability of the local elite to influence \npublic expenditure.    \nThe project goal is to improve social and economic well-being of the population in the barani areas. Specifically, the \nProject is aimed at improving the livelihood system of the poor households in the project area with emphasis on \nwomen and the vulnerable segments of the rural population. The main sectors that need support are agriculture, \nlivestock, natural resource management, and physical infrastructure development at the village level. The project \napproach will include linkages and partnerships among the main stakeholders, the village communities, including \nwomen, the poor and the vulnerable, professionals from the district government service delivery departments, and \nlocal government representatives to develop good governance at the grassroots level. It is expected that the Project \nwill help improve farming systems, support services for agriculture and livestock, rural infrastructure, and increased \nnonfarm income generation for the poor. Promotion of good governance through the mobilization and capacity building \nof the community-based organizations would create local ownership of the project activities, transparency in service \ndelivery, and accountability of government agencies. The Project will contribute to poverty alleviation in the barani \nareas of Punjab through promotion of good governance, building of social capital of women and the poor, increased \nproductivity in agriculture and livestock, improved rural infrastructure, improved natural resource management, and \nincreased income generation opportunities for small farmers, women, and the landless. \n \n                                                 \n4  Approximately 60% of all farms in the area are below subsidence (2 ha) in size.  \n5  Source: Project preparatory technical assistance survey, April 2004. \n6  Computed from Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, 2001\u201302.

Participation Process \nThe participation process designed for the Project is focused to proactively further social development, facilitate the \nownership of all stakeholders, ensure sustainability of operation and maintenance of investments, realize the inclusive \npolicies of devolution, and minimize asset inequalities. Local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) as well as \nprovincial and national rural support programs (RSPs) will conduct a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) with the local \ncommunities and poor households for each of the project components to assess the situation, and identify the target \npopulation and planning of activities. More specifically, the PRA will identify the need for special approaches required \nfor active participation of women and marginalized groups, including the poorest of the poor. Need assessment will be \ndone in the area of faming, livestock, natural resources management, rural access roads, and nonfarm activities. The \nconstraints faced by rural poor in their livelihood system will be one of the major focuses of the need assessment. The \nPRA will include men and women stakeholders from the communities. Specific effort will be taken to ensure \nparticipation of poor men and women in the process. Base line survey will be conducted for the targeted households to \nmeasure the impact of the Project at the end of the project cycle. Participatory and transparent planning processes will \nbe introduced in the Project and the stakeholders will be provided with training in participatory development. The \nselected NGOs and the RSPs be involved in facilitating the processes.  \nLocal NGOs and RSPs will be involved in: (i) identifying the target villages according to the proposed targeting criteria; \n(ii) coordinating between the project and the community based organizations/citizen community boards (CBOs/CCBs) \n(iii) identifying and strengthening existing CBOs/CCBs through targeted capacity building measures; (iv) mobilizing \nand supporting the existing and new partner CBOs/CCBs and sensitizing them to social issues, regarding women, \nchildren, labor and human rights, as well as providing organizational and management support and providing \ninformation and exposure on project initiatives and opportunities; and (v) assisting CBOs to pursue registration as \nCCBs for securing annual development funding. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn the rural economy, women are working alongside men as equal partners and contributors in productive sectors \n(agriculture and livestock) but their contribution is not fully reflected in Government statistics. Women not only manage \nthe household chores (cooking and washing, sewing, cleaning the house, bearing and rearing children, etc.) but also \ncollect water and fuel wood, cut fodder, and actively participate in other agricultural and livestock activities. \n \nAccording to the population census 1998 and the labor force surveys, there seems to be an underestimation of the \nfemale labor force participation rate. For instance, in the project districts, almost 95% of the females of 10 years and \nabove were classified as household workers by the population census 1998, hence they were not considered a part of \nthe labor force. The census data show that 53% of males and only 2.1% of females of the working age cohort (10+) \nare economically active. \n \nHowever, the agriculture census 2000 reaffirms that women add to economic productivity especially in the agriculture \nand livestock sectors, e.g., in the Bhakkar district, 27% of the full-time and 51% of the part-time workers involved in \nagriculture are women. Similarly, 44.5% of the full-time and 52% of the part-time workers involved in livestock \nactivities are women. These data are further substantiated by focus group discussions and in-depth interviews \nconducted during the poverty assessment and livelihood analysis in the project area. The livelihood study data also \nreveal that in poorer families, women are more active in economic activities. There are variations in female labor \nactivities according to districts and distinct sociocultural conditions in various areas. In the northern belt, women are \nconstrained to activities (livestock or related) within their family compounds.  \n \nUnder the new local government system, participation of women has been ensured by allocating 33% of the seats in \nthe elected local governments (zila council, tehsil council, and union council) to women. To improve their active \nparticipation in governance, training (as members of the council, and monitoring committees has been identified and \nrecommended by the Project.  \n \nThe design features of the Project include the following measures to ensure women\u2019s participation in the various \nactivities  of  the  Project  especially  under  the  targeted  poverty  alleviation  and  literacy  through  skills  training \ndevelopment components. During implementation, through the gender action plan, mechanisms will be developed and \nrefined for active involvement of women in project activities and for providing specific benefits of the Project to poor \nwomen.  \n \nSocial Mobilization/Group Formation: The RSPs will be involved in strengthening the existing CBOs/CCBs and in \nmobilization and outreach activities to facilitate women\u2019s group formation and/or establishing women\u2019s CCBs at the \nvillage level or neighborhood level as relevant. The group/CCBs will be the entry point of project interventions for \n ", "Appendix 8          41 \nvarious project activities. Group formation/CCB formation will be carried out for male groups also. Mobilization \nactivities will be designed to form 40\u201350% of female groups/CCBs.  \n  \nAgriculture: Women members of the groups/CCBs will be involved in the training/extension program of crop and \nvegetable demonstration plots, activities related to village seed bank and seed grader, improving the lining of \nwatercourses, farmer field schools, and field research activities. \n \nLivestock: Women members of the groups/CCBs will be provided with the livestock extension services. Targeting \npoor women for village veterinary workers will create employment and income earning opportunities for women from \nthe poor households. Women from the livestock rearing and farm households will be included in the training/extension \nof fodder and feed supplement demonstration and conservation plots. Women are the primary target beneficiaries for \nactivities related to household energy needs, and preparation of organic fertilizer and biogas plants.  \n  \nManagement of Natural Resources: Activities related to development of agriculture, pastoral land, soil conservation, \nwater  resource  management,  and  women\u2019s  groups/CCBs  should  be  actively  involved  in  training/extension/ \ndemonstration and relevant activities. The RSPs will facilitate the involvement of women\u2019s groups/CCBs.  \n \nRural Access Roads: Women\u2019s groups/CCBs will be part of the consultation for planning of rural access roads. The \nlocation of rural roads has an impact on women\u2019s daily household activities, farm activities and access to markets, \nhealth services, and education facilities.  \n \nOff-Farm Activities: Half of the targeted beneficiaries of the off-farm income earning activities and skills training will \nbe women. Off farm-activities could be developed in traditional crafts. Women artisans from the villages should be \ntargeted for linkages with microfinance institutions for small-scale microenterprise development. \n \nLiteracy Through Skills Training: One component of the project is specifically designed for women. Provision has \nbeen made for the literacy training of about 20,000 rural women from poor households through special courses \nfocused on imparting livelihood and household skills. In order to provide an incentive for women to participate in the \ntraining program the skills courses will be linked to potential credit provision through the project RSPs for women who \nsuccessfully complete the training modules. \n \nLinkages Between Women\u2019s Groups/CCBs and Government Agencies: The RSPs will facilitate the women\u2019s \ngroups/CCBs in order for the women\u2019s group/CCBs for participating in planning and implementing project activities. \n \nCapacity Building and Institutional Development: Capacity building of the relevant government agencies will \ninclude support to the gender reform action plan under Decentralization Support Program. In addition, the capacity \nbuilding program will target men and women elected representatives of the relevant local government. The capacity \nbuilding training modules prepared under RETA: Gender and Governance Issues in Local Government7 for elected \nrepresentatives of the local government should be used (strengthened as relevant) for the training of the elected \nrepresentatives. The institutional capacity and capacity building of the staff of the district administration will include \ngender sensitization training and planning exercise with rural women and the poor. Women staff of the relevant \ngovernment offices will be included in the capacity building, awareness, and training program. \n \nMonitoring Indicators: A gender-disaggregated database will be included in the project benefit monitoring system to \nmonitor the number of men and women beneficiaries targeted and achievement of the target in each of the above \nproject activities. The database will be disaggregated by socioeconomic characteristics of the households to measure \nthe involvement of men and women from the poor households and vulnerable groups. Community monitoring and \nevaluation will ensure that the targeting criteria are being followed and the project benefits reach the poor. \n \nGender and Development Support: The consulting service package includes a provision for (i) a foreign consultant \nsocial  impact  specialist  to  address  all  social  issues,  including  gender;  (ii) a  domestic  consultant  consulting \norganization/gender specialist to work over the first 4 years of the Project to ensure that gender concerns are \naddressed;  and  (iii) three  full-time  social  impact/gender  specialists  assigned  to  the  Project  Management  Units  \nthroughout the full duration of the project to ensure that social and gender concerns are adequately addressed and \nincorporated in a gender action plan. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  The Project is demand-driven by design; implying that specific subproject interventions \nwill be determined by beneficiaries during the implementation phase. As such the environmental \nimpacts  of  each  subproject  or  the  overall  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  cannot  be \nassessed during the design stage. Instead, the Project design includes a detailed document \noutlining the environmental assessment and review procedures (EARP) to be followed during \nimplementation  (Supplementary  Appendix to  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident). The EARP report describes a set of subproject selection criteria, which at the outset \neliminate  any  subprojects  that  may  warrant  an  environmental  impact  assessment  level  of \nanalysis.  Procedures  are  outlined  for  subprojects  that  require  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  level  of  analysis,  and  for  those  that  do  not  require  any  environmental \nassessment, a general set of environmental guidelines is proposed.  \n2.  A typical subproject that requires an IEE1 was selected and subjected to the IEE process \ndescribed in the EARP report. This will serve as a model IEE, and form the basis for future IEEs \nto be undertaken for subprojects to be implemented under the Project. The full IEE report is an \nattachment to the EARP report and the summary IEE is presented below.  \nB.  Project Description \n3.  This  IEE  report  investigates  the  environmental  impacts  of  a  rural  access  road  in  \nHaiderababad union council in Mankera tehsil, in Bhakkar district. The route originates in the \nvillage of Shah Sayed Ali up to the village of Bhidwalwala, through the villages of Toperi, \nDarbula, and Sarwarwala. The total length of the surveyed access route is 20.5 kilometers. The \nselected route already exists as a jeepable dirt track connecting the five villages.  \n4.  Construction methodologies and specifications2 already in practice by the district road \ndepartment under the funding of Asian Development Bank will be followed by the Project. \nApproved stone quarries will be used to source material for subbase and base formation. \nBitumen material will be used as surface sealant.  \n5.  The works and services department will hire local residents of the five villages that lie \nalong  the  access  route  in  the  construction  of  the  road  wherever  unskilled  labor  is  to  be \nemployed. A basic construction camp will be set up in an existing land clearing to accommodate \nany heavy equipment and laborers not belonging to the villages along the route.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  As per the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 and the Pakistan Initial Environmental Examination and \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Review Regulations 2000. \n2  The specifications and procedures to be employed are standard of the American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Official or the American Society for Testing and Material as indicated in their latest editions. \n ", "44          Appendix 9   \nC.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Environment \n6.  The project area is located in the desert zone, which spreads over a vast expanse in the \ndistricts of Bhakkar and Layyah. The project area is located at the eastern edge of the desert \nzone, close to the district boundary between Bhakkar and Jhang. As such the area constitutes a \ntypical sand dune desert with very little vegetation. The climate of the area is hot and arid. The \naverage rainfall is less than 240 millimeters (mm) per annum, with the lowest at 180 mm per \nannum. The temperatures could rise to around 50\u00b0C during the summer months but could drop \nbelow  freezing  point  in  the  winter  and  at  night.  The  area  is  characterized  by  high  winds \nthroughout the year, subjecting the area to dust storms.  \n7.  The only water available to the project area is groundwater that is accessible either \nthrough dug wells or deeper tube wells. Local residents reported that sweet groundwater was \nbeing accessed at less than 30 meters and 90% of the households have hand pumps or electric \nmotors.  When watered, sandy soil of the dunes can support a variety of crops since the soil is \nrich in nutrients. Farmers have channelized groundwater from tube wells for irrigation purposes \nwherever possible. \n2.  Biological Environment \n8.  The  project  area  lies  close  to  the  edge  of  the  Thal  Game  Reserve,  a  nationally \ndesignated protected area. The area is visited by many migratory bird species the great Indian \nBustard (Ardeotis Nigriceps), the Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis Undulata), and Sand Grouse \n(Pteroclididae). The Thal Game Reserve is most well known for the Houbara Bustard, which is \nsubject to sport hunting. Mammals include the Chinkara Gazelle (Gazella Gazella) and Desert \nFox (Vulpes Bengarlenisis). The Chinkara is close to extinction due to habitat depletion. Lizards \n(Valetes Varisceler) are also found in this desert ecosystem. The vegetation found in the Thal \ndesert consists of grasses, shrubs and trees (Prosopis, Juliflora, Prosopis, Ceneria, Acacia Sps. \nare common species)  that require little water and can survive in the harsh temperatures of the \narea.  \n3.  Socioeconomic Environment \n9.  The population of the villages are as follows: Shah Syed Ali\u20146,000, Darbula\u20141,800, \nToperi\u20142,500, and Bhidwalwala\u20142,400. The total landholdings of the villages varies between \n31,280 acres in Darbula, approximately 375 acres in Sarwarwala, 3,750 acres in Toperi, and \n1,250 acres in Bhidwalwala. The project area lies across three rakhs (i.e., community range \nlands): rakh Dhingana, rakh Haiderabad, and rakh Mankera. Most lands in these rakhs have \nbeen allotted to local residents for cultivation purposes. \n10.  Agriculture is the main source of income in the project area, supplemented by livestock. \nGram is the only crop grown in the area. Small local businesses and daily wageworkers form \nthe other two brackets of occupations.  \n11.  The villages of Darbula, Shah Sayed Ali, and Sarwarwala are connected to the national \ngrid. The project area is not linked to the nationwide telephone line, though many residents own \ncellular phones, and there are some public call offices in the area. The village of Toperi has a \nprimary school, Bhidwalwala has a middle school, and Darbula, has a boys\u2019 high school. Qadir \nEducation Foundation, a local nongovernment organization, has set up girls\u2019 primary schools at \nDarbula and Toperi and a girls' vocational school. \n ", "Appendix 9          45      \n  4.  Cultural and Archaeological Sites \n12.  No archaeological sites were reported or sighted in the area of the three villages or \nalong or in proximity to selected road. However, there are many shrines or ziarats (graves of \nreligious scholars and saints) in the area. Local pilgrims revere these sites and visit them \nregularly. Additionally there are graveyards and mosques associated with the villages. There \nare three ziarats in the area that are regularly visited by pilgrims. Two of these ziarats are \nlocated in Shah Saiyed Ali village (Pir Saiyed Ali Shah and Pir Fateh Din) and one is near \nDarbula (Mian Allah Jawaya). \n  5.  Civil Society Organizations \n13.  The  presence  of  NGOs  in  the  project  area  is  very  limited.  Only  one  NGO,  Qadir \nEducation Foundation, is doing some work in the villages of Darbula and Toperi. \nC.  Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures \n14.  Although construction of road links is likely to have an overall positive impact on the \ncondition and livelihood of the residents of the local communities, some adverse impacts may \narise during the three phases of the road construction project: planning, construction, and \nimplementation.  These  impacts  and  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  described  in  the \nfollowing table. \nTable A9.1: Impacts and Proposed Mitigation Measures \nPotential Impact  Mitigation and Monitoring Measures \nImproper and inadequate surveying of trace resulting  Proper survey of the land of the area with the assistance \nroad trace conflicting with existing land uses and  of the local land revenue officer and village residents to \nexisting protected areas  avoid residential properties, private agricultural properties, \ncultural and religious sites, and protected areas \nIncorrect road and pavement design resulting in  Conducting sound technical feasibility study based on \ninadequate drainage and premature degradation from  assessment of soils and hydrology of the area. \nexposure to extreme weather conditions \nNuisance to nearby communities through noise and  Control noise by limiting operating hours of heavy \ndust emission and loss of privacy  machinery; control dust by sprinkling construction sites \nwith water; locating construction camp at least 500 meters \nfrom a community; and obtaining water for construction \nand other laborers' requirements from a deep tube well \nOverexploitation of existing water resources  Using abandoned brackish water wells whenever possible \n  Ascertain full community participation in the operation; \ncommunity to be consulted \nIncreased soil erosion at construction sites  Proper construction practices, adequate monitoring, \nhealth and safety trainings to all construction workers; \nand planting of drought-resistant plant species along the \nnew access track to curb any soil erosion that may arise \ndue to construction of this new road. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n15.  A mitigation management matrix has been prepared that lists all activities likely to have \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  the  various  phases  of  the  Project  (i.e.,  design, \nconstruction, and operation) and recommends mitigation measures for these impacts along with \nthe  person/institution  responsible  for  the  mitigation  measures  and  for  monitoring,  the \n ", "46          Appendix 9   \nparameters to be monitored, and the timing for carrying out the mitigation or monitoring. This \nmatrix will be used as a management and monitoring tool for implementation of the mitigation \nmeasures required by the IEE.  \nD.  Environmental Monitoring Plan \n16.  The environmental monitoring plan includes the following components. \n1.  Activity Monitoring \n17.  Activity monitoring will be carried out to ensure compliance with the requirements of the \nIEE, the environmental monitoring plan will be used as a management and monitoring tool. The \ndistrict  environment  officers  and  Agency  for  Barani  Area  Development  (ABAD)  project \nenvironmental staff will regularly visit the sites for activity monitoring during construction.  \n2.  Effects Monitoring \n18.  Effects monitoring will be the responsibility of the district environment officer and ABAD \nproject environmental staff. A detailed monitoring program will be prepared, which will cover the \nphysical, biological, and socioeconomic environment. The monitoring program will describe in \ndetail the resources and methodology that will be adopted for the purpose of effects monitoring. \n  3.  Postproject Monitoring \n19.  After completion of the road construction operation postproject monitoring will be carried \nout in order to determine the level of residual impacts of the Project on the environment of the \narea. The postproject survey report will be submitted to the Project management unit and \nproject steering committee within 14 days after completion of the survey. \nE.  Budget and Staffing Requirements \n20.  The following section relates to budget and staffing requirements of the entire Project \nand not just the Bhakkar road subproject. Responsibility for monitoring and compliance with \nnational environmental legislation and policy at the provincial level lies with the Environmental \nProtection Department, Punjab. Further, at the district level, following devolution of government \nto  the  local  level  through  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001,  a  district  officer, \nenvironment is responsible for all matters relating to the environment.  \n21.  It  has  been  agreed  with  the  Government  that  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental safeguards proposed under the Project, three dedicated staff positions will be \nestablished in ABAD to cover all environmental issues connected to the Project interventions.  \n22.  The  budget  for  environmental  inputs  including  environmental  assessments, \nappointments, and other operation and maintenance costs is presented in the following table. \n \n ", "Appendix 9          47      \nTable A9.2: Budget for Environmental Inputs \n                  (Local  ($  Total \nItem          Unit  Total  '000)  '000)  ($'000)\n  Costs          \nA.

Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n23.  Community consultations were carried out in August 2004 in five villages lying along the \naccess route, including Bhidwalwala. More than 60 people attended the consultation meeting at \nDarbula village after an agreement deed as signed between by the villagers confirming their \nconsent to constructing a road through the area. All the people present unanimously agreed to \nthe proposed track without conditionalities and pledged to provide their wholehearted support to \nthe Project. Similarly, discussions and verbal pledges were also taken from the local councilors \nIllahi Baksh and Muhammad Amin. Muhammad Naseem, the village nambardar,3 also took part \nin this discussion. Like Darbula, people showed up in great numbers to attend the public \nconsultation meeting\u2014approximately 50 people attended. The people entertained the idea of a \nroad to their village. However, some did not immediately understand the importance of a bypass \naround the community. However, after detailed discussion they understood, and agreed to \nhaving  the  road  connect  their  village  to  the  main  road,  and  to  a  bypass.  A  community \nconsultation meeting was arranged at Sarwarwala a large number of people (10\u201315) were \npresent in the primary school building of the village. This is the most backward village in the \narea and people took great interest in the discussion. Along with the inhabitants of Sarwarwala, \nelders of the nearby small hamlets also attended. All local residents shared the opinion that the \nproposed route should not pass through the middle of their village, an agreement deed was \nsigned  after  mutual  agreement.  A  public  meeting  was  conducted  in  Bhidalwala,  all  local \nresidents (5\u201310 people) appreciated the idea of a metaled road from Bhidwalwala to Shah \n                                                 \n3  An honorary position held by a village notable, selected by the government. The nambardar oversees all land \nrelated transactions, collects the actual land revenue (maaliya), and has the authority to attest property and other \ndocuments. He also has the main responsibility of identifying the actual landowner when a transaction is to take \nplace. This position is to some extent hereditary. It was institutionalized during the British era, following from the \nMogul period. \n ", "48          Appendix 9   \nSayyed Ali, as it would provide unhindered access for them to the local produce market at \nHyderabad and the dal (gram pulse) factory at Shah Sayyed Ali. The village of Shah Sayyed Ali \nlies at the beginning of the access track, and is already connected to the Bhakkar-Jhang road. \nHowever, since land along the access track is owned by the residents of the village their \nconsent  was  sought  through  a  consultation  meeting.  These  landowners  (five  in  number) \npledged full support to the proposed track.  \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n24.  The  IEE  finds  that  no  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  building  a  farm-to-market \naccess  road  between  Shah  Sayed  Ali  and  Bhidwalwala,  union  council  Haiderabad,  tehsil \nMankera, district Bhakkar are likely. The communities that lie in the area along the selected \naccess route will benefit from such a development activity and it will serve to improve the quality \nof life of the people of the areas. Some minor impacts relating to construction may be likely; \nhowever, the incorporation of appropriate mitigation measures recommended through the IEE \nwill mitigate or altogether remove these impacts. \nH.  Conclusions \n25.  The IEE concludes that no detailed environmental impact assessment for the subproject \nabove is required. \n \n ", "Appendix 10          49 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Project Justification \n \n1.  The project interventions pursue both efficiency and equity objectives. The need for the \nProject arises from the prevalent high poverty incidence, unemployment, poor organization and \nsuboptimal use of factors of production, and poor delivery of social and economic services. \nMoreover, lack of adequate investment in physical, productive, and social infrastructure and \ninefficient delivery mechanisms has inhibited the economic growth of rural areas in general, and \nin barani areas in particular.  \n \nB.  Approach and Methodology \n \n2.  As the Project will follow a process approach, it allows for support of a variety of \ninterventions as identified by the beneficiaries. The present analysis is based on assessment of \nindicative  model  budgets  of  potential  interventions.  The  representative  models  have  been \nanalyzed for quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs and benefits, impact on household income \nand poverty, economic viability, and distribution of the project benefits. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n \n3.  For purposes of presentation, the analysis has been broken down by the major project \ncomponents. For component 1 (village and union development), medium-scale infrastructure is \nenvisioned, at a minimum cost of $25,000 (and maximum of $150,000). For component 2 \n(targeted poverty alleviation), smaller-scale activities at the village and community levels are \nexpected,  with  most  in  the  range  of  $2,000\u201310,000.  In  fact,  the  divisions  are  not  totally \nexclusive. Some types of subprojects will extend into both ranges depending on the scale of \nactivity or whether several subprojects of a similar nature are bundled to meet the higher \nthreshold. \n \n  1.  Economic Summary \n \n4.  Table A10.1 summarizes project economic internal rates of return (EIRRs), sensitivity, \nand switching values for the sample subprojects. The presentation demonstrates that there are \nviable technologies that the Project can facilitate and that these will contribute to the betterment \nof the population residing in barani areas. The subproject EIRRs range from 13% to 36%, with \nmost clustering near 20%, or higher.  \n \n5.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken by subjecting the subprojects to (i) cost increases of \n10%, (ii) benefit decreases of 10%, and (iii) both. (The results are summarized in the table.) \nOnly one subproject, the dug well (salt range) appears vulnerable to such variation in the cost \nand benefit parameters. Its EIRR drops to as low as 10.1% if both costs increase and benefits \ndecrease by 10%. However, since water is so highly valued in these dry areas, that may still be \nacceptable  for  those  inhabitants.  All  13  other  interventions  remain  economic  under  those \nrestrictive  sensitivity  conditions.  Lastly,  switching  values  for  cost  increases  and  benefit \ndecreases are provided in the table, and, again, the figures demonstrate the economic stability \nof the models. \n \n ", "50          Appendix 10 \nD.  Financial Analysis  \n \n6.  Financial analysis, based on the subproject models, suggests that the interventions will \nsignificantly contribute to household incomes. For this analysis, most of the financial gains have \nbeen assessed on a per hectare basis. The values generally range from PRs2,000 ($35) to \nPRs9,000 ($150), with outliers at PRs717 ($12) and PRs14,200 ($240). Notwithstanding the \nsize of subprojects, the financial gains from most of the subprojects are modest, in terms of per \ncapita increase in income; nonetheless they are a significant addition from the low base. \n \n7.  Table A10.2 presents a summary of investment costs and financial internal rates of \nreturn (FIRRs) for various indicative model subprojects. The FIRRs also demonstrate private \nparty viability and incentives to participate in the Project. \n \n \nE.  Off-Farm Employment \n \n8.  One of the immediate objectives of the Project is employment generation. This is to be \nachieved through execution of subprojects, increased demand for farm labor arising from the \nincreased productivity, and through literacy through training in skills development. It is expected \nthat  the  subprojects  will  require  a  significant labor  force.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  assist \ncommunities in acquiring skills and trades that will be demand-based. That should enable \ninhabitants to be gainfully employed within the project area, or should enhance their skills for \nbetter  employment  outside  the  project  area.  The  stakeholders  in  field  meetings  clearly \nexpressed the need for training in various skills and trades. However, at this stage, it is difficult \nto  ascertain  the  demand  and  absorption  rate  of  trained  persons.  Per  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance estimates, it is expected that 12,000 individuals will benefit from a range of \nvocational  skills  and  enterprise  development  support  to  be  offered  under  the  Project.  On \naverage, a trained person is estimated to generate net annual incremental income of PRs6,098 \nin the case of improved profitability of existing enterprise, and PRs21,705 in the case of paid \nemployment. \n \nF.  Distribution Analysis and the Poor \n \n9.  Though  each  subcomponent  varies  in  terms  of  distribution  of  benefits  between \nstakeholders (poor farm households with less than 1 hectare (ha) landholding, landless livestock \nmenders, unskilled landless labor), gains of most of the subprojects will mainly accrue to poor \nsegments of the population, especially small farmers. It is estimated that about 70% of the \nbenefits from the irrigation, soil conservation, and natural resource management subprojects will \ngo to the poor farm households and landless laborers.  \n \n10.  Distribution and poverty impact analyses are carried out for four sample subprojects: \nvillage drinking water supply, jeepable track, pasture and rangeland development, and village \nelectrification. Many of the villages with no water supply or access to electrification are more \nremote and poorer than those that have already been covered. For jeepable track, the poor are \nestimated to make up 90% of the labor supply and for road user benefits, the poor are estimated \nat two thirds of their representation in the barani population. This adjustment is made to allow \nfor disproportionate road use benefits going to vehicle owners and those who can more easily \nafford travel. For rangeland and pasture development, the poor are viewed as disproportionately \nhigh among the common land users, and are estimated as 75% of the main beneficiary group.  \nIn sum, all of these sample models suggest that project activities are well structured and likely to \nhave an impact on the poor and reduce poverty. Poverty encompasses considerably more than \n ", "Appendix 10          51      \njust low income. In addition to improving livelihoods, the Project provides advancement in terms \nof access to social services, social infrastructure, and literacy and skills training. \n \nG.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n11.  Under the targeted poverty alleviation component, prior to undertaking any intervention, \nthe beneficiaries are required, as a step in the systematic approval process, to (i) give their \nformal  acknowledgement  of  the  requirements  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nsubprojects, (ii) formalize an O&M plan with delimited responsibilities, and (iii) commit resources \nto  ensure  that  the  plan  is  carried  out.  For  the  union  development  component,  the \nimplementation of medium-scale infrastructure (such as roads or rural electrification) will likely \nbe carried out by the line agencies. For this, official procedures are in place for O&M of public \ninfrastructure. In addition, revised commitments are being made for local governments (districts) \nunder devolution specifically for the O&M budget\u2014i.e., funds that are not to be reallocated. \nVillage mobilization, provided under this component, should also build awareness, support, and \ncommitment for O&M in community groups. Lastly, as a prerequisite to subproject approval, \nbeneficiaries are required to provide up-front cash\u2014funds that can be dedicated to future O&M \nrequirements. In addition, an O&M framework between beneficiaries and public agencies will \nalso be developed to institutionalize funding and execution responsibilities for all O&M-related \nrequirements.
