The proposed technical assistance (TA) was requested by the Government of India to \ncomplement  India\u2019s  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and  Management  Investment  Program \n(SCPMIP).1 The SCPMIP is designed to deal with immediate coastal protection needs and \ncoastal instabilities through planning, design, and investment in environmentally and socially \nappropriate protection and management in the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra. The TA is \ndesigned to incorporate and mainstream measures for coastal climate change adaptation in the \nprogram. \n \n2.  A Global Environment Facility (GEF) project identification form was prepared in late \n2010. It was endorsed by the two state governments of Karnataka and Maharashtra, Ministry of \nWater Resources (MOWR), and Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), and approved by \nGEF in November 2011. Preparation for the TA from April to September 2012 included wide-\nranging  consultations  with  the  central  government,  the  state  executing  agencies  for  the \nSCPMIP,  district  government  and  community  organizations,  and  key  coastal  research \norganizations. The TA formulation incorporates the insights gained during the discussions. A TA \nfact-finding mission was fielded on 13\u201328 June 2013, during which the government confirmed \nthe proposed TA design and monitoring framework, cost, implementation arrangement, and \nterms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  The \nGEF financing proposal was approved by both states, MOWR, and MOEF in July 2013 and \nGEF letter of commitment was received on 12 March 2014. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  India has a coastline of 7,525 kilometers (km) of which 5,425 km encompass the nine \nmainland coastal states and 2,100 km the union territories and islands. There has been limited \nexternal  assistance  for  coastal  protection  and  management,  which  resulted  in  a  lack  of \nexposure  to  new  ideas  and  practices.  The  most  frequently  applied  methods  for  coastal \nprotection have been hard structures such as seawalls or groins. The on-going SCPMIP and \nWorld Bank financed Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP) are both trying to \naddress this gap through complementary initiatives fostering the adoption of more socially and \nenvironmentally friendly coastal erosion protection and management measures in India. The \nSCPMIP is supporting the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka in (i) developing integrated \nparticipatory  shoreline  management  plans  for  long  term  sustainable  management  and \ndevelopment of the shoreline and, (ii) pilot testing the transition to softer coastal protection \nmeasure aimed at restoring lost beaches, rather than merely preventing land erosion. The later \nincludes the construction of semi-submerged off shore artificial reefs and the provision of beach \nnourishment  in  critically  eroded  beaches.  The  ICZMP  assist  the  Government  of  India  in \ndeveloping coastal zone management national guidelines, mapping of India coastal hazard line \nand costal sediment cells. It also supports integrated planning and pilots soft coastal protection \ninvestments in the states of Gujarat, Odisha.  \n4.  The ongoing erosion of beaches in India is a major challenge that threatens communities \nand livelihoods in a variety of areas, including artisanal fishing, tourism, and other activities \nrelated to beaches and natural resources. Coastal erosion is responsible for the loss of land, \nhouses, infrastructure, and business opportunities, and poses a high risk to human well-being, \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2010. Multitranche Financing Facility to India for Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Investment \nProgram. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 June 2013. \n ", "22  \neconomic  development,  and  ecological  integrity.  It  undermines  the  livelihoods  of  coastal \ncommunities, particularly poor households, and ultimately the coastal economies. Every year, \nabout 400 hectares of coastal land is lost and, 75,000 hectares of crop areas, 34,000 residential \nhouses and industrial establishments are affected by coastal erosion and flooding. The impact \ncould be much more extensive in the coming years as the coastline is increasingly subject to a \nwide range of economic developments and changes in land use, many of which create conflicts \nand pressures on the already disturbed natural coastal environments. While it is the poor rural \ncoastal communities that are the most vulnerable to the impacts of erosion and inadequate \ncoastal management, many of India\u2019s rapidly growing urban areas are also vulnerable to coastal \nerosion. Mumbai, for example, incurs a cost of $2.5 million per km to protect some of its prime \nwaterfront property. \n \n5.  The government needs to encourage low-cost protection solutions, including natural \nprotection  such  as  beach  dunes  and  mangrove  management.  Natural  protection  is  being \ndeveloped internationally, and India already counts successful initiatives that the SCPMIP and \nthe proposed TA can build on. \n \n6.  The threats of climate change on the coast result from (i) a rise in sea levels caused by \nthermal  expansion  of  sea  water,  melting  glaciers  and  ice  caps,  and  over-exploitation  of \ngroundwater; (ii) changes in wave characteristics such as size and direction due to changes in \nwind patterns and increases in depth, changing the impact of wave on the coast; (iii) changes in \nfrequency  and  intensities  of  storms  and  storm  surges;  (iv)  vertical  land  movements  from \nisostatic adjustments (changes in the earth's crust) and localized land settlement affecting the \nnet changes in sea level; and (v) changes in freshwater flow regimes, flood flows, and salinity, \nwhich have effects on the estuaries and coastal rivers. \n \n7.  All the Indian coastal states and territories are affected by coastal erosion. The rise in \nsea levels and the likely increase in frequency and intensity of storms will aggravate the erosion, \nwith serious economic and environmental consequences for coastal states. Beaches cover 43% \nof the coast, and coastal wetlands (mud flats) cover 36%, and both play an extremely valuable \nrole  in  protecting  the  coastline.  Disturbances  to  the  beaches  and  coastal  wetlands  from \nanthropogenic and climate change impacts can be very significant. Current estimates predict \nthat shoreline recession can be in the range of 50 to 200 times the rise in relative sea level, \nestimated  to  be  around  0.3  meter  by  mid-century.  Mangroves  are  reasonably  tolerant  to \nchanges  in  sea  levels  and  salinities,  but  are  vulnerable  to  sediment  removal,  which  can \npreclude natural renewal and conventional planting methods. Rising sea levels combined with \nstorm surges can significantly increase coastal and estuarine flood risk. Coastal infrastructure is \ncurrently designed based on historic sea levels and wave regimes, with an estimated design life \nof 50\u2013100 years. Infrastructure projects will become increasingly vulnerable to damage unless \nappropriate measures of climate resilience are incorporated. \n \n8.  Without climate change studies that focus on coastal areas, construction of coastal \nprotection infrastructure and planning of shoreline management proceed largely according to \ncurrent  standards,  which  do  not  explicitly  consider  climate-change-related  risks  and \nvulnerabilities. In the absence of clear and officially endorsed design guidelines, planners and \ndesigners have neither the knowledge base nor the mandate to design for potential impact \nscenarios under climate change. Government decision makers require adequate evidence of \nthe risks to support the provision of additional finance for climate resilience. \n \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be strengthened resilience of the Indian coast to the impacts of \nclimate change. The outcome will be that climate change impacts are factored into coastal \nprotection and management interventions in India. The TA will support mainstreaming of climate \nchange resilience into coastal protection and shoreline management through carefully targeted \nmeasures,  including  (i)  specialist  support  to  the  SCPMIP  to  incorporate  climate  change \nresilience in projects 2 and 3 investments; (ii) preparation of officially endorsed climate change \nadaptation guidelines to be officially communicated to all maritime states and union territories; \nand (iii) successful implementation of pilot community protection subprojects.3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years and will support mainstreaming of climate \nchange in costal planning and management at the national level and in the two focal states of \nKarnataka and Maharashtra, where the SCPMIP project is operational. The four key outputs \nand activities are summarized below:    \n \n(i)  Climate  change  adaptation  guidelines  for  protection  and  management  of  the \nIndian coast are officially endorsed. This includes (i) analysis and interpretation of \nclimate change trends and projections for the whole Indian coast, building on ongoing \nwork  of  key  Indian  research  institutes  as  well  as  international  climate  research; \n(ii) incorporating climate change parameters into information systems being developed \nby the central agencies; and (iii) preparing planning and design criteria and guidelines \nfor coastal climate change adaptation.  \n(ii)  Shoreline  management  is  climate-resilient  in  two  focal  states.  This  involves \nprovision  of  expertise  to  support  the  SCPMIP  in  incorporating  climate  change \ninformation and adaptation measures into planning and design of subprojects, shoreline \nmanagement plans, and coastal information systems. Outputs of the climate change \nanalyses and guidelines will be applied to planning and design studies in the two focal \nstates, and in socioeconomic studies of different adaptation strategies. Special focus will \nbe given to planning and design of community-led natural protection measures and \nsupport for community livelihoods.  \n(iii)  Coastal investments in two focal states incorporate climate resilience. Through \nmore scientific and rigorous analysis under the TA, the investments under project 2 and \n3 of the SCPMIP in Karnataka and Maharashtra will incorporate appropriate approaches \nto  climate  resilience,  including  both  soft  and  hard  measures.  Soft  infrastructure \ninterventions will focus on the use of innovative, less invasive technologies such as \nclimate-resilient  beach  nourishment,  dune  management,  coastal  mangrove,  and \nvegetation  restoration  and  protection.  Hard  infrastructure  intervention  will  consist  of \nhigher-investment and engineering-type solutions designed to perform under climate \nchange conditions. In addition, the TA will directly finance the implementation of up to six \nsmall pilot projects that will test and demonstrate community-based, climate-resilient \nnatural protection focusing on beach and dune management. \n                                                \n3  Project 1 implementation is expected to be completed late 2015. It was initially delayed due to lack of readiness, \nnecessity to modify the detail designs and delayed approvals and implementation capacity of the executing \nagencies. Project 2 and Project 3 of the SCPMIP will be submitted for ADB approval in 2015 and 2016, \nrespectively. \n ", "44  \n(iv)  Institutions have strengthened capacity and raised awareness of coastal climate \nchange and adaptation measures. The TA will support (i) training in climate adaptation \nguidelines,  supplementing  the  SCPMIP  training  programs  in  the  two  focal  states; \n(ii) training for a cadre of about 25 state and national trainers in the application of climate \nchange guidelines, including coastal climate change information systems; (iii) training \ncourses  for  senior  officials  and  stakeholders  from  other  maritime  states  and  union \nterritories; and (iv) dissemination of information, awareness raising of decision makers \nand other stakeholders, and strengthening of the knowledge networks concerned with \nclimate change adaptation in coastal areas. \n \n11.  The  key  assumptions  are  that  (i)  the  maritime  states  accept  the  climate  change \nadaptation  guidelines  and  absorb  the  additional  costs  to  incorporate  climate  resilience; \n(ii) central and state ministries are committed to revising regulation so as to integrate climate \nchange into design and investments; and (iii) recipients of training are, and remain, active \nplayers in coastal protection and management activities. \n \n12.  Some  associated  risks  are:  (i)  climate  change  impacts  exceed  model  projections;  \n(ii) state governments and communities do not adopt adaptation measures because impacts of \nclimate  change  are  uncertain  and  difficult  to  measure,  and  periods  of  moderate  climate \nconditions exist; and (iii) community-based natural protection measures may not demonstrate \nsufficient benefit and may provide levels of protection below stakeholder expectations, resulting \nin poor stakeholder response and government reluctance to support upscaling.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,050,000, of which $ 2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by GEF, and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of (i) office space at the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) and \nCentral  Water  Commission  (CWC);  (ii)  office  space  in  SCPMIP  offices  in  Mangalore  and \nMumbai;  and  (iii)  counterpart  staff  to  support  coordination  and  liaison  for  pilot  community \nprojects  in  the  two  focal  states,  and  processes  to  officially  endorse  the  climate  change \nadaptation guidelines. The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The executing agency for the TA will be MOWR; the nominated focal person will be the \nCWC\u2019s chief engineer, flood management, supported by the director of coastal erosion. The \nexecuting agency will supervise and coordinate overall project execution. MOWR will create a \nnational technical committee for the duration of the TA to review and endorse the TA outputs for \nclimate change adaptation. The composition of the committee will include chairperson-member \nof river management of CWC; chief engineer, flood management of CWC; director, CWPRS; \nnominees from MOWR, MOEF, Ministry of Earth Sciences, and Bureau of Indian Standards; \nproject directors, SCPMIP Maharashtra and Karnataka; project director of the World Bank-\nfunded  Integrated  Coastal  Zone  Management  Project;  and  other  technical  specialists  from \nnational institutes and academia as required. Planning and design guidelines will be reviewed \nand ratified by the existing coastal protection development advisory committee. MOEF is the \nGEF focal point in India and will provide support and coordination in ensuring compliance of the \nproject with GEF guidelines. It will also be associated with the review and approval of planning \nand design guidelines, including TA monitoring and evaluation. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented through three agencies: \n ", "  5 \n(i)  Nationally, the CWPRS is to provide specialist technical support and guidance in the \nanalysis and interpretation of climate change data, and in the implementation of training \ncomponents in coordination with CWC (responsible for outputs 1 and 4).  \n(ii)  At the state level, it is the Public Works Ports and Inland Water Transport Department in \nKarnataka, and the Maharashtra Maritime Board. TA management and coordination will \nbe carried out through existing program management units of the SCPMIP (responsible \nfor outputs 2 and 3) which are within the two state agencies.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  36  months,  from  June  2014  to  June  2017.  An \ninterdisciplinary team of international consultants consisting of research scientists and coastal \nspecialists will be recruited. The consultants will work at national, state, district, and community \nlevels. An input of 22 person-months of international consultants and 44 person-months of \nnational  consultants  is  proposed.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  through  a  firm  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The quality and cost-based \nselection procedure with a technical\u2013financial weighting of 90:10 on a full technical proposal will \nbe used. The consultancy contract package will include provisional sums to cover the costs of \n(i) subcontracting  three  national  focal  research  institutes  for  climate  change  analysis; \n(ii) subcontracting local nongovernment organizations and contractors for the implementation of \npilot community projects; (iii) preparing training courses, workshops, and awareness materials; \nand (iv) engaging an advisory panel of experts. Payments to the consulting firm, including \nprovisional  sums,  will  be  made  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The three national focal research institutes to be subcontracted through the consulting \nfirm will undertake climate change studies that require access to data and specialist analysis \nthat are only available to the institutes directly or in cooperation with other institutes. The studies \nwill primarily source and analyze existing data and research and will not require significant new \nresearch;  and  each  assignment  will  be  relatively  small,  requiring  less  than  $100,000  per \ninstitute. The unique expertise and access to data of the focal institutes are not available from \nother sources; hence single-source selection will be applied.4   \n \n18.  The advisory panel of experts will review and endorse the climate change analysis and \nguidelines for adaptation. To provide interaction of a wide geographical spread of expertise and \nincorporation of different coastal conditions, each of the 12 maritime states and union territories \nwill be requested to nominate one institute or coastal specialist in addition to the four national \nexperts to be appointed to the panel. The panel will be chaired by  one elected member. \nConsulting inputs to the advisory panel will be 8 person-months in total. The panel members will \nbe recruited through institutes or as individual experts. The consulting firm will be responsible \nfor the contractual arrangements and remuneration of the panel members. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n19.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,000,000  to  the  Government  of  India  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility for the Climate-Resilient Coastal \nProtection and Management Project. \n                                                \n4  The proposed institutes and main areas of support are the (i) National Institute of Oceanography\u2014historic trends in \nsea levels, projections for sea level rise, changes in vertical land levels, changes in wave characteristics from \nclimate  change;  (ii)  Indian  Institute  of  Tropical  Meteorology\u2014downscaled  wind,  rainfall,  and  temperature \nprojections,  including  analysis  of  uncertainty;  and  (iii)  Centre  for  Atmospheric  Sciences,  Indian  Institute  of \nTechnology Delhi\u2014analysis of historic and projected storm surges. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2024:    Assumption \nStrengthened  30% of new and  Detailed project reports  Maritime states \nresilience of the Indian  rehabilitated major  submitted for approval by  accept financing  of \ncoast to impacts of  coastal infrastructure in  state governments to CWC  additional costs \nclimate change  India incorporate climate  and CWPRS  for climate change \nresilience according to    adaptation  \nthe guidelines supported     \nby the Special Climate    Risk \nChange Fund (baseline    Climate change \n2013 = 0)a  impacts exceed \n  model projections \nOutcome  By 2019:     \nClimate change  Project clearances by  Advisory notice from the  Risks \nimpacts are factored  state and central  Ministry of Water   \ninto coastal protection  authorities require  Resources to maritime  Poor stakeholder \nand management  climate resilience to be  states and union territories  response to \ninterventions in India  factored into the design  to apply the adaptation  community-based \nof coastal infrastructure  guidelines and to ensure  natural protection \n  that climate resilience is  measures, and \n  incorporated in coastal  government \n  planning and design  reluctance to \n    support upscaling \n50% of new and  Detailed project reports   \nrehabilitated coastal  submitted for approval by   \nprotection and  state governments to CWC \ninfrastructure projects in  and CWPRS \nthe two focal states   \nincorporate climate   \nresilience   \n(baseline 2013 = 0)   \n   \n20% of the  Questionnaires and \n520 kilometers of  surveys to communities \nvulnerable shorelines in   \nthe two focal states   \nincorporate low-cost   \nnatural protection   \nmeasures   \n(baseline 2013 = 0%)   \n \nOutputs   By 2016:     \n1.
