", "", "   \n   \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (R-CDTA) will provide \nsupport to the development and financing of urban infrastructure1. The concept paper for this R-\nCDTA  was  approved  by  the  vice-president,  Knowledge  Management  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment, on 2 September 2011. This TA will support a range of upstream activities for \noperations departments (ODs) to help lay the groundwork for urban infrastructure projects that \ndemonstrate  additionality  and  innovativeness  in  terms  of  structuring  and  financing \nenvironmental and pro-poor projects. By providing this upstream support2, the TA expects to \ncreate a robust pipeline of viable urban environmental projects, particularly PPP projects (with \nprivate finance leveraged through guarantees). It will also help attract private sector finance for \nurban investment. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is in appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Asia\u2019s urban areas are becoming the key drivers of its economic growth and the resultant \ngains in poverty reduction, generating about 70 percent of the wealth of the region. However, \nthe unprecedented scale and rapidity of urbanization, combined with inadequate infrastructure \ninvestment, strained public financial resources and weak institutional structures for managing \ncities,  is  leading  to  major  shortfalls  in  coverage,  service  levels  and  quality  of  urban \ninfrastructure.  Adequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services  are  critical  to  enhancing  the \nproductivity of urban areas and hence, to achieving more equitable growth and development \nthat is also environmentally sustainable.  \n \n3.  Public financial resources alone are insufficient to meet the large scale financing \nneeds of urban infrastructure and development. Hence, support is needed for innovative \nfinancing mechanisms that help leverage limited public resources. Faced with multiple \ndemands on their budgets, developing member countries\u2019 (DMC) governments are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to provide sufficient investment finance for urban infrastructure. During the \nten-year period from 2010-2020, ADB\u2019s developing member countries are expected to need \nnearly US$750 billion in annual investment for infrastructure. Around 68% of this is needed for \nnew capacity investments in infrastructure and around 32% is needed for maintenance or \nreplacement  of  existing  assets.  In  general,  the  total  projected  infrastructure  investment \nrequirements are equal to about 6.5% of Asian estimated 2010-2020 GDP3. It is also estimated \nthat only half of the requirements will be financed by governments, external agencies, local \nfinancial  institutions  and  the  private  sector.  The  scenario  is  compounded  because  urban \ninfrastructure  continues  to  lag  significantly  in  generating  commercial  investment  interest, \nespecially where scope for cost recovery is limited over the short term, but projects could be \n                                                \n1  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Trust Fund (UEIF) under the \nUrban Financing Partnership Facility (UFPF) which was established in November 2009, with support of the \nGovernment of Sweden (Sida). \n2   UFPF resources are also available for downstream support via grant investment co-financing. Resources for grant \ninvestments can be accessed as part of a new ADB project, an addition to an ongoing project or project comprising \npart of a program in which ADB is a partner. Investment grants will require operational departments to follow \nstandard procedures for loan/grant approval depending on the specifics of the project, and signing a Grant \nAgreement with the recipient government. \n3  Bhattacharyay, B. 2010. Estimating Demand for Infrastructure in Energy, Transport, Telecommunications, Water \nand Sanitation in Asia and the Pacific: 2010-2020. ADBI Working Paper 248. Tokyo: Asian Development Bank \nInstitute. \n ", "2 \n \nfinancially viable in the long-term. Credit enhancements mechanisms (such as guarantees) are, \ntherefore, still needed to mitigate lending risks for urban infrastructure projects, and to mobilize \nand leverage resources cost effectively from local financial markets since they are key to \nsustainable financing of urban infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Institutional capacities for integrated urban development and investment planning, \nproject development, and urban financing are weak. Hence, support is needed to build \nrelevant  institutions  and  their  capacity  in  these  areas.  Sub  national  governments  and \nentities are highly constrained in their institutional capacity for urban development management, \nincluding urban planning, infrastructure investment programming, structuring financially viable \nand sustainable projects with private sector and financial sector involvement. Thus, there is a \npressing need not just for enhanced investment but also for improving the capacity of local \ngovernments and institutions in order to develop a robust pipeline of projects that can be taken \nup for public and/or private financing and efficiently manage urban services and the overall \nprocess of urban development. \n \n5.  In light of these issues, there is growing recognition that (a) the modes of government \nand international agencies\u2019 financing support for urban infrastructure should be responsive to \nlocal needs, (b) government and international agencies\u2019 support for urban infrastructure should \nbe better suited to sub national governments\u2019 emerging requirements in investment planning, \nproject development, overall urban management and their emerging fiscal structures, and (c) \nprivate sector participation and finance needs to be catalyzed on a large scale to supplement \ngovernment and international agencies\u2019 support. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n6.  Interventions  under  the  proposed  TA  will  support  efforts  to  overcome  the  above \nconstraints. The proposed TA will streamline ODs\u2019 access to the resources of the UFPF to help \nthem respond better and expeditiously to DMCs\u2019 issues in the development and financing of \nurban infrastructure described above. Within the framework of the Implementation Guidelines \n(IGs) as set out under the UFPF, the TA will support a range of upstream activities for ODs and \nwill give priority to projects that demonstrate additionality and innovativeness in terms of (i) \nintegrated urban infrastructure panning and management, (ii) environmental improvements, (iii) \ninnovative financing to leverage limited public resources and catalyze private sector resources, \nand (iv) pro-poor urban development.   \n \n7.  The proposed TA (i) has incorporated lessons for effectiveness learnt from the existing \nFinancing Partnership Facilities; (ii) addresses a sub national target group, in particular, cities \nand utilities that are providing public services, and their financiers; and (iii) brings synergies with \nother initiatives under the draft Urban Operational Plan, the draft Public Private Partnerships \nOperational Plan and Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA)-supported projects. The TA \naims  to  trial/demonstrate  innovative  urban  projects  and/or  leverage  funds  for  urban \ninfrastructure projects, through grant and guarantee support respectively (e.g., for PPP projects \nin Indonesia and Vietnam).  \n \n8.  In sum, the TA will assist sub national governments and entities in developing and \nfinancing  urban  infrastructure.  By  providing  synergies  with  ongoing  and  planned  urban ", "  3 \n \ninfrastructure initiatives, the TA will add value to activities of the ODs. Specifically, it will add \nvalue by (i) providing support for the implementation of the draft Urban Operational Plan and \nassist in the implementation of the draft PPP Operational Plan; (ii) serving as a time and cost \neffective support mechanism for pre-feasibility, project development and structuring, financial \nclosure and implementation; and (iii) providing resources for Private Sector Department/PPP \nadvisory to promote innovative modes of private sector participation in infrastructure investment. \nThe TA will also increase the attractiveness of co-financing for a wider range of partners. The \nfirst group of ODs proposals4 has been endorsed for support and fund allocation by the UFPF \nUrban Infrastructure Working Group. For details, a supplementary appendix is available upon \nrequest.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved infrastructure services in DMC cities to enable \nthem to contribute more effectively to countries\u2019 economic development and poverty reduction. \nThe outcome is increased urban environmental projects, particularly PPP projects (with private \nfinance leveraged through guarantees). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The proposed activities are grouped into three components as below. The activities will \nbe carried out in close coordination with ODs:  \n \n(i) Component A: Project preparation and implementation for innovative, environmental, \npro-poor  urban  infrastructure.  This  component  will  support  ODs  by  providing  financial \nresources for identifying, preparing and supervising innovative, pilot initiatives that would link to/ \nget scaled up under an ensuing urban infrastructure project. Most DMC local governments have \ninadequate technical capacity to develop and supervise such projects. Further, the costs of \nprocuring quality technical and financial advisory services are significant and are often beyond \nthe already constrained budgets of governments/ sponsoring authorities. Support will be for \nactivities including pre-feasibility and feasibility assessments, pilot approaches, public private \npartnerships,  operational  efficiency  improvements,  financial  structuring,  legal  reviews, \ndevelopment of documentation such as concession agreements and commercial assessment \nstudies (e.g., demand assessments). This component is helping support pre-PPTA activities, \nsome of which may include preparation of pilot approaches/ initiatives.  By requiring, to the \nextent  feasible,  that  the  consultants  who  do  project  development-type  activities  work  with \nofficials of the EAs, the TA is helping build capacity as well. \n \n(ii)  Component  B:  Support  for  establishment  of  credit  enhancement  mechanisms  to \nfacilitate  innovative  financing  of  environmental,  pro-poor  urban  infrastructure. \nAppropriately  structured  guarantees  can  serve  as  non-distorting  mechanisms  for  financing \n                                                \n4  Pilot  Innovative  Solid  Waste  Management  (Philippines);  (ii)  Water  and  Wastewater  Operation  Improvement \n(Mongolia); (iii) Coastal Cities Urban Environment and Climate Change (Vietnam); (iv) Pilot Project for Application of \nRenewable Energy, and Reduction, Reuse and Recycling of Resources, 3R (PRC); (v) Karnataka Integrated and \nSustainable Water Resource Management Investment Program (India); and (vi) GMS Corridor Towns: Managing \nSolid Waste - Mainstreaming the 3-R Approach (Cambodia\u2013Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam). \n ", "4 \n \nurban infrastructure. This component will support ODs by providing financial resources for \nidentifying  projects  with  scope  for  innovative  financing,  and  preparing  and  structuring \nguarantees for such innovative financing of urban infrastructure projects. It will provide advisory \nservices to help local governments/project sponsors structure guarantee /credit enhancement \nmechanisms to (i) mobilize and leverage resources cost effectively from local financial markets \nand consequently, also support capital market development for urban infrastructure, and (ii) \nimprove  their  capacity  to  develop  overall  investment  financing  strategies  using  guarantee \ncomponents. The support will be targeted at local governments and utilities, local financial \ninstitutions,  and  other  entities  such  as  Special  Purpose  Vehicles  (SPVs)  involved  in  the \ndeveloping and financing of urban infrastructure projects.  \n \n(iii)  Component  C:  Capacity  development,  knowledge  and  networking  support  for \ninnovative, environmental and pro-poor urban infrastructure. This component will help \nbuild the capacity of national and local governments, stakeholders and other project sponsors to \nidentify, develop and implement urban infrastructure projects. This will include building the \ncapacity for multi-stakeholder, integrated urban infrastructure and strategy planning; capital \ninvestment  planning  and  programming;  financial  management;  developing  and  structuring \nenvironmentally sound, viable, pro-poor projects; and project management and supervision. It \nwill also include knowledge generation and dissemination on policy, fiscal and institutional \nframeworks for sustainable delivery of urban environmental infrastructure. \n \nC.  Cost Financing  \n11.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure \nFund5 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility6. The total cost of the TA is $1.7 million \nequivalent. The detailed budget and source of financing is in appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The  proposed  TA  will  be  executed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division  (RSID)  will  implement  the  TA  in  close \ncoordination with ODs responsible for urban infrastructure projects. Details on project proposal \nsubmission, and review procedures, will be developed in consultation with ODs. The proposed \nTA will require 40 person months of international specialist inputs in the area of infrastructure \nproject  development  and  management,  finance,  project  economics,  and  public  private \npartnerships; 48 person months of national specialist inputs with expertise similar to that of the \ninternational experts and 24 person months of individual national consultant inputs for fund \ncoordination. The terms of reference for consultants are in appendix 3. In general, individual \nconsultants will be engaged. However, consulting firms will be hired in limited cases, depending \non the requirements of the project. No team leader has, therefore, been nominated. The \nnumber of experts and their titles will also vary as per particular project requirements and have, \ntherefore, not been specified. Similarly, outputs and titles of each individual consultant cannot \nbe  specifically  defined  as  they  will  depend  on  the  particulars  of  the  assignment/project. \nConsultants will be hired and managed by the ODs and will report to them. ODs will provide a \nshort brief on the results of the project to RSID, for results monitoring. All consultants will be \n                                                \n5  Contributor: Government of Sweden. \n6  Administered by ADB.

In addition to activities under components A, B and C, funds can be used to \nprocure goods and equipment. Procurement will follow ADB's procurement guidelines (2010 \namended from time to time), and its turnover and disposal arrangements upon completion of \nthe TA, as amended from time to time. The TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s TA \nDisbursement Handbook (May 2010, amended from time to time). The start and completion \ntime frame of the TA is November 2011 to November 2013. ODs will make a footnote reference \nin their project documentation to the upstream/supplementary activities of their project that will \nbe  implemented  under this  RETA. The  expected  outputs  and  outcome  evaluation  will  be \ndisseminated  through  workshops  and  through  feedback  into  prospective  projects  in  the \npipeline. \n \n13.  As  the  UFPF  is  likely  to  receive  additional  resources7,  this  TA  will  require  future \nchanges of scope, TA amount and implementation.8  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n14.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1.7 million to be financed on a grant basis by the \nUrban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility for \nSupport to Infrastructure Development and Financing. \n                                                \n7  Sweden has committed a replenishment of SEK50 million as of September 2011. \n8  ADB. 2008.
