INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will contribute to strengthening the \ncapacity of the Bangladesh Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) within the Local \nGovernment Division of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives \nand its Gender and Development (GAD) Forum. The TA will extend similar capacity development \nsupport to other infrastructure agencies involved in Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects, i.e., \nthe Bangladesh Railway, Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB), Dhaka Water Supply \nand Sewerage Authority (DWASA), and Khulna Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (KWASA). \nIt will enable the women development officers of the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs \n(MOWCA) to more effectively monitor, analyze, and consolidate the gender equality results of \nurban and rural infrastructure development projects. \n2.  The objectives of this TA are directly linked to the vision and mission set out in the Seventh \nFive Year Plan (2016\u20132020) of Bangladesh and LGED\u2019s Gender Equality Strategy. 1 This TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2018\u20132020, and serves to \nimplement the gender strategy stipulated in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, \n2016\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bangladesh has made rapid progress as measured by several social and economic \nindicators, moving from a human development category of low in 2013 to medium in 2014\u20132016.3 \nThe incidence of extreme poverty has declined by 47% in urban areas and 26% in rural areas.4 \nWomen\u2019s economic participation significantly improved, from 26.1% in 2002 to 57.2% in 2011. \nWhile this progress is noteworthy, gender equality is far from being fully achieved. While rapid \nurbanization has contributed to economic growth, it has resulted in the growth of low-income \nsettlements and slums, and associated social problems, such as increased competition over basic \nfacilities and services (e.g., education, health, water, transport, and electricity).5 Women and men \ndiffer in their roles, needs, and perceptions regarding urban development. Women often serve as \nthe primary collectors, transporters, users, and managers of domestic water, promote home and \ncommunity-based  sanitation  activities,  and  have  a  primary  role  in  waste  disposal  and \nenvironmental  management.  They  bear  a  primary  responsibility  for  household  chores  and \nchildcare.  Consequently,  housing  design\u2014including  lighting,  ventilation,  and  security\u2014is  of \nimmediate importance to them. Access to services and transportation has differing implications \nbased on gender, age, mobility. Poorer settlements such as urban slums are likely to include \nhouseholds headed by women, which have special needs related to access to clean water and \nsanitation, health services, and education for their children. Gender-inclusive infrastructure\u2014such \nas construction of separate toilets for women in easily accessible and safe areas, construction of \nwater collection points and tube wells at suitable areas, well-lit access roads for traveling, and \nwaiting  rooms  for  women  in  bus  terminals\u2014can  contribute  to  women\u2019s  socioeconomic \ndevelopment and gender equality. Violence or the threat of violence is a constraining factor, with \nthe exposure of women and girls to threats of sexual harassment in public \n \n1 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2015.

Gender-inclusive infrastructure, including construction of street lights, safe access roads, \nand  well-lit waiting  areas in  bus and  railway terminals can decrease  the threat of sexual \nharassment for girls and women. \n4.  LGED has a critical role in responding to gender issues in infrastructure development for \ntwo reasons: (i) its wide scope of operations and geographic coverage and large workforce \n(11,184 with approximately 10% of LGED sanctioned posts occupied by women) provides wide \ncoverage for gender mainstreaming efforts; 6 and (ii) as the sole infrastructure agency with a \ngender equality strategy, LGED is envisaged to take a lead role in promoting gender inclusive \ninfrastructure development in Bangladesh. However, a recent assessment of LGED\u2019s gender \nmainstreaming practices, particularly in its  urban development projects, found  these to be \nconfined to projects supported by development partners (including ADB), with the LGED GAD \nForum not fully equipped to undertake its responsibilities.7 LGED and the GAD Forum lack the \ncapacity to effectively integrate gender sensitivity into human resource development and adopt \nworkplace and anti-harassment guidelines. \n5.  This TA will build on LGED\u2019s lessons from mainstreaming gender in its ADB-supported \nurban development projects, which point to the importance of building LGED\u2019s internal capacity \n(trained staff and financial resources) to implement the nine targets of its Gender Equality Strategy, \nusing well-established gender mainstreaming standards and procedures, and cooperating with \nother government agencies and other stakeholders in engendering, sustaining, and expanding \ngood practices. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA is aligned  with the following impact:  women\u2019s access to and benefits from \ninfrastructure resources and social services (e.g., urban and rural transport infrastructure; and \nwater supply and sanitation, employment, and market facilities) increased. The TA will have the \nfollowing  outcome:  effectiveness  in  delivering  gender  equality  results  and  social  inclusion \nimproved.8 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n7.  Output 1: Capacity of the Local Government Engineering Department at the central \nlevel strengthened. This output supports the LGED GAD Forum and relevant central units \n(planning, training, design, and monitoring and evaluation) in spearheading and coordinating \ninitiatives to mainstream gender at all levels of LGED operations (both internal and external), and \nfully deliver the commitments set out in its Gender Equality Strategy. The TA will train the GAD \nForum and senior central LGED staff on gender mainstreaming tools and techniques in key LGED \nsectors  of operations,  support  the  enhancement  and  operationalization  of  LGED\u2019s  gender \ninformation management system (GIMS), and train the LGED Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in \noperationalizing the GIMS. \n8.  Output 2: Capacity of Local Government Engineering Department senior staff and \nfunctioning gender committees in 64 districts strengthened. LGED is highly decentralized, \n \n6 LGED has no gender-disaggregated data on its workforce at the central and local levels. \n7 ADB. 2017. Institutionalizing Gender Equality: Urban Development Experience of the Bangladesh Local Government \nEngineering Department. Manila. \n8 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "3 \n \n \nwith 99% of staff working in the field, making it important for field staff to be engaged and trained \nin mainstreaming gender in the core operations of LGED. The TA will (i) assess the gender \nmainstreaming practices of 64 district offices of LGED; (ii) train senior staff and members of LGED \ndistrict gender committees in 64 districts in gender mainstreaming; and (iii) establish coordination \nsystems (e.g., designation of focal persons, setting of regular consultations and information and \ncommunication exchange mechanisms) between the GAD Forum and district gender committees. \n9.  Output 3: Knowledge sharing and partnerships among various agencies in gender \nmainstreaming increased. LGED is the sole infrastructure agency in Bangladesh with a gender \nequality strategy, and could serve as a model for other infrastructure agencies. Knowledge \nsharing and partnerships among agencies are expected to strengthen LGED\u2019s gender \nmainstreaming efforts. To share LGED\u2019s gender mainstreaming practices and lessons and \ndevelop partnerships with other infrastructure agencies, this TA will (i) train the gender focal \npersons or designated staff of selected infrastructure agencies (Bangladesh Railway, BREB, \nDWASA, and KWASA) in mainstreaming gender in infrastructure development; (ii) build the \ncapacity of women development officers and program officers of MOWCA in setting up, mobilizing, \nand coordinating a multistakeholder mechanism for monitoring the gender equality results of \ninfrastructure development; and (iii) conduct two lateral learning events: a subregional conference \nto draw lessons from the practices of government agencies and other stakeholders in South Asia; \nand training of LGED, Bangladesh Railway, BREB, DWASA, KWASA, and MOWCA on \ninternational models of gender-inclusive infrastructure where experts will be invited as resource \npersons. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.08 million, of which $2.00 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund For Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The following are ineligible expenditures under the \n2017 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction policy guidelines and are not included in the TA\u2019s cost \nestimates and financing plan (Appendix 2): (i) academic research, (ii) purchase of vehicles for \nproject administration, (iii) salaries for civil servants, (iv) foreign travel, (v) scholarships or long \ninternships, and (vi) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited \nInvestment Activities List.9 \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace for the project management unit, meeting venues, access to data and information from \ninternational and national consultants, staff time to review consultant outputs and conduct periodic \nfield visits, and other in-kind contributions. The consultants will arrange their own travel. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. Bangladesh Resident Mission will recruit an international \norganization (consulting firm or nongovernment organization) using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method (90:10 quality to cost ratio) and will engage the consultants and carry out \nprocurement following ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n13.
