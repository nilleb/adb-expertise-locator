During the 2002 Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Programming Mission to the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC), the Government reconfirmed its request for technical assistance \n(TA) for Participatory Poverty Reduction Planning for Small Minorities as a follow-up to TA 3610-\nPRC: Preparing a Methodology for Development Planning in Poverty Blocks under the New Poverty \nStrategy. After successful preparation of the methodology and its adoption by the State Council \nLeading Group on Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOP) to identify poor villages within the \n\u201ckey working counties\u201d (which are eligible for national poverty reduction funds), the Government \nwould  like  to  apply  the  methodology  to  the  PRC's  poorest  minority  areas  to  prepare  poverty \nreduction  plans  with  villager,  local  government,  and  nongovernment  organization  (NGO) \nparticipation. A Fact-Finding Mission was conducted at different periods from September-December \n2002  (given  the  large  number  of  provinces  and  autonomous  regions  involved)  and  reached \nagreement  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants for the proposed TA.1  The TA framework is \nattached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since economic reforms began in 1978, the Government has prioritized funding for poverty \nreduction and has an advanced administrative structure stretching from the national to the village \nlevel to implement poverty reduction programs. Using the Government's official definition of poverty, \nabsolute rural poverty decreased from 250 million in 1978 (30.7% of the rural population) to 30 \nmillion in 2000 (3%).2 An estimated Y198 billion ($23.9 billion)3 was targeted to the poor from 1994 \nto 2000. During the same period, Y43 billion ($5.1 billion) was targeted to minorities.  In 2001, the \nGovernment introduced a new 10-year poverty reduction strategy that (i) prioritizes assistance to \nthe remaining absolute poor; (ii) helps those who are vulnerable to falling back into poverty because \nof natural disasters or medical emergencies; (iii) targets minority, border, mountainous, and remote \nareas; (iv) uses the ADB-assisted multidimensional, participatory poverty planning methodology, \nwhich defines poverty broadly according to income, quality of life, infrastructure access, and social \ndevelopment  indicators;  and  (v)  mandates  a  role  for  civil  society  and  NGOs  to  help  design, \nimplement, and monitor Government-led poverty reduction activities. On the objective to target \nminorities, focused effort to assist the smallest of the minority groups is justified by (i) the fact that \nsmall size compounds the extreme poverty and isolation faced by many communities in these \ngroups, (ii) the reality that most programs and funds target larger population minority groups, and \n(iii) the urgency of protecting cultures to ensure their long-term survival.  \n \n3.  Minority  groups  (non-Han  Chinese)  living  mainly  in  western,  border,  mountainous, \ngrassland, and forest areas are among the poorest people in the PRC.  Of the 55 officially classified \nminority groups, 22 have a population under 100,000.4  The total combined population of these \ngroups is around 600,000. Given their relatively small populations compared with other minority \ngroups, they are referred to as \u201csmall minority groups.\u201d5 From 1994 to 2000, there was a reduction \nof subsistence-related poverty among these small minority groups. However, poverty remains an \nentrenched problem. Their production and living (such as housing) conditions; access to roads, \n                                                           \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 September 2002. \n2   The absolute poverty line is Y625 annual income.  Using the international $1 a day standard, poverty was 110 million in \n2000, over three times the Government poverty figures. \n3   Inclusive of national and local government funding as well as civil society donations. \n4  According to the Fourth National Census of 1990.   \n5 There are also very small groups known as ren with unique lifestyles and customs (such as the Deng and Xiaerba), \nwhich the Government does not  classify as small minorities. ", "2 \npower, and water supply; and access to health and education services are poor. Their capacity to \nwithstand natural disasters or medical emergencies is weak. They have income levels below the \nnational average, and most of them are at or slightly above the subsistence poverty line. Most of the \nnonpoor people in rural areas where small minority groups live have low-income levels. Even those \nwhose subsistence needs have been addressed are vulnerable to falling back into poverty. In \nnormal years, the number of people falling back under the poverty line is about 15%. In years with \nnatural disasters, the proportion is as high as 40% in some places. In the past, the Government did \nnot specifically target small minority groups for assistance.  Instead it targeted geographic regions \nand the poor irrespective of minority status. \n \n4.  The State Ethnic Affairs Commission (SEAC) is responsible for all minority groups with \nsignificant attention to the main groups (Zhuang, Man, Muslim, Miao, Uighur, Tujia, Yi, Mongol, and \nTibetan), which account for 81% of PRC's minority population. It does not have funds to specifically \ntarget the 22 smallest minority groups (accounting for less than 1% of PRC's minority population). \nLGOP envisages investing over Y30 billion ($3.6 billion) a year in poor areas under the 10-year \nPoverty Reduction Strategy, with a portion targeted towards the 22 small minority groups (with the \nplan developed under the Project expected to recommend an appropriate portion). This is the first \ntime the Government has attempted a large-scale multiminority plan focused on poverty reduction \nand cultural protection of small minorities. It will also be the first time for ADB to be involved in a \nmajor minority-related planning exercise in any member country. The broader aid community in the \nPRC has had projects with activities that include minorities or selective activities targeted at certain \nminorities. The World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, and the International Labor Organization have done studies and implemented \nminority-related  projects  in  the  PRC  and  other  countries.  The  lessons  learned  from  these \nexperiences will be examined and applied as appropriate to the plan developed under the TA.  The \nTA will promote participatory methods to fight poverty.  For a small investment, the TA will help \ninfluence how $3.6 billion per year will be used to assist the most vulnerable minorities. \n \n5.  The  22  small  minority  groups  are  mainly  distributed  in  11  provinces  and  autonomous \nregions. The Bulang, Achang, Nu, Jinuo, De\u2019ang, and Dulong live in Yunnan; the Pumi are in \nYunnan and Sichuan; the Menba and Luoba are located in Tibet; the Maonan live in Guangxi and \nGuizhou; the Jing are in Guangxi; the Sala reside in Qinghai and Gansu; the Bao\u2019an and Yugu are \nin Gansu; the Ewenke and Elunchun are in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang; the Hezhen live in \nHeilongjiang; the Tajike, Uzibeke, and Tatar are located in Xingjiang; the Eluosi (Russians) are in \nXinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang; and the Gaoshan reside in Fujian.  A brief description of \nthe history and socioeconomic status of the minorities is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  According to a 2001 survey conducted by SEAC, the small minority groups are mainly \ndistributed in 70 counties (and cities), 209 townships (and towns), and 587 administrative villages. \nAmong the 70 counties (and cities), 61 counties (and cities) are included in the Western Region \nDevelopment Program. Sixty counties are minority autonomous counties, and 20 are eligible for \nnational poverty reduction funding. In 2000, the poverty incidence rate of the small minority groups \nin these villages was over 5 times higher than the national figure of 3.5% in terms of income and \ngrain production. \n \n7.  Several non-income indicators suggest that small minority groups are worse off than other \npoor people in the PRC despite the fact that most live in nonpoor counties. The SEAC survey \nindicated that the lack of road connections among poor administrative villages, which was 9.5% for \nthe whole country, was 22% for the 587 administrative villages where small minority groups are \nconcentrated. Lack of electricity access was 5.0% nationally versus 10.9% for the small minority \ngroups.  About 48% of the poverty-stricken households monitored for rural poverty in the PRC ", "    3     \nlacked access to safe drinking water compared with 56.0% for small minority areas. Among the 587 \nvillages where the small minority groups are concentrated, 42.6% had no postal services, 38.7% \nhad no primary school, and 54.3% had no health subcenter. The survey also showed that 31.4% of \nthe poor in the PRC had no telephone service provision to their areas versus 42.1% for small \nminority areas. Lack of television service provision was 4.7% nationally for the poor versus 29.5% \nfor small minorities. \n \n8.  During TA processing, ADB staff held participatory consultations with around 350 villagers \namong the 22 small minority groups. The meetings discussed the causes and effects of poverty in \ntheir villages, the main difficulties facing the villagers, and their suggestions on how to address their \ndifficulties. Issues differ from place to place depending on geographic, environmental, historical, \nand cultural factors.  However, there were many common issues. The main concerns of villagers \nacross provinces and regions, and confirmed by government and NGOs, are (i) access to education \nbeyond primary school, and better teacher quality and facilities; (ii) access to affordable health care, \nand better quality medical staff and facilities; (iii) environmental protection of grasslands against \ndesertification; (iv) balancing environmental protection laws on forestry, grasslands, and wildlife with \ntraditional occupations such as hunting and logging, and ensuring that such laws do not contribute \nto  impoverishing  minority  cultures  by  introducing  mitigating  measures  and  policies;  (v)  stable \nirrigation systems and drinking water supply for both villagers and livestock; (vi) improved roads to \naccess markets and information and to attract investors; (vii) advanced technical and management \nskills  in  livestock  raising,  cash  crops,  alternative  agricultural  activities  to  hunting,  increasing \nagricultural production, marketing, and agro-industry; (viii) better housing to improve quality of life; \n(ix) access to affordable credit to engage in business and associated training; and (x) cultural \nprotection  through  both  education  (bilingual  education  and  textbooks  in  local  languages)  and \ntourism (management of tourist spots and natural resources and expansion of handicraft industries, \nespecially for women). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the advisory TA is to apply the multidimensional and participatory poverty \nplanning methodology developed under TA 3610-PRC (and other best international practices in \nparticipatory planning) to the PRC's 22 smallest minority groups and develop a plan (including \nminority-specific policies) to reduce their poverty and to protect their cultures that is realistic and \nachievable, given Government budget commitments and constraints.  The main output, the final \nreport, will be the consolidated plan with policy recommendations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will use a participatory approach to examine the situation of each minority group, \ndevelop a strategy to tackle the main poverty problems, and develop a plan for each group followed \nby a consolidated plan showing the activities that the Government will then fund and implement. \nThis will be complemented by appropriate training for villagers, local government officials, and \nNGOs. Since one third of the 22 minorities and 38% of the total small minority population are in \nYunnan and because there are many active domestic and international NGOs in the province \nknowledgeable about participatory approaches, the TA team will commence its work there.  At the \ninception workshop, LGOP, SEAC, and the team leader will present their visions.  The minority \nexperts will present their report on the status of the 22 small minority groups. The international \nconsultants will present best international practices in poverty reduction planning for minorities, \ncultural protection, and project design considering suggestions made by NGOs.  The sector experts ", "4 \nwill present best practices in their fields. In consultation with the small minority group members, the \nteam will then develop a model plan in Yunnan (for the De'ang minority group) using participatory \nmethods and allowing inputs and ideas from NGOs active in Yunnan. Local researchers, small \nminority experts, economists, poverty experts, and NGOs will be hired on a short-term basis to \nassist the team to gain in-depth expertise of the cultures and local economies they are trying to \nhelp. When completed, an expert panel (comprising villagers, local economists, academics, minority \naffairs and poverty experts, government officials, and NGO representatives) will review the model \nplan. Experts in minority issues will need to be recruited at short notice in remote areas for short \nperiods in a similar way that ADB handles honoraria for experts. The consultants will improve the \nplan based on the comments.   \n \n11.  The consultants will then split into five subteams and go to the northeastern (Heilongjiang \nand Inner Mongolia), western (Gansu and Qinghai), southern (Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, \nand Fujian), Xinjiang, and Tibetan regions to replicate the model and adjust the plans according to \nlocal conditions.  Local teams will assemble in each region and follow the approach used in \nYunnan, modified as necessary to fit local conditions.  Special efforts will be made to recruit \nqualified Uighur and Tibetan consultants, draw upon other local experts in Xinjiang and Tibet, and \nrecruit minorities in the other provinces as local experts. Then the teams will proceed to Beijing to \nhave the plans reviewed by LGOP, SEAC, a national expert panel, and the sector specialists (the \nleaders of the regional subteams).  The plans will then be unified into a national plan within national \npoverty reduction fund budget limitations, which LGOP will take the lead in implementing. The final \napproved plan will be disseminated to all affected communities.  Small pilot projects to reduce \npoverty and promote cultural protection will be developed and funded (one for each of the five \nregions)  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  the  plans.  During  the  course  of  plan  development  and \ndissemination, workshops and participatory planning training will be held with villagers, NGOs, \nresearchers, and local government officials. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,050,000 equivalent comprising a foreign exchange \ncost of $149,000 and a local currency cost of $901,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of National \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategies  and  will  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $691,000 \nequivalent of local currency cost for a total of $840,000 equivalent. ADB will administer the TA \nfunds.  The Government\u2019s in-kind contribution for office accommodation, transport, remuneration of \ncounterpart staff, and other services will amount to $210,000 equivalent. A detailed cost plan is in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Foreign Capital Project Management Center (FCPMC) of LGOP, having the broad \nmandate for rural poverty reduction planning, will be the Executing Agency for the TA. LGOP will \nensure  coordination  with  Central  Government  ministries,  particularly  with  SEAC  and  local \ngovernment agencies, research institutes, and NGOs at provincial and county levels.  A project \nimplementation team comprising the acting director general, a division chief, and a project officer of \nFCPMC will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the TA and will serve as counterparts to \nthe consultants, as will poverty office staff at the local levels. A project steering committee to guide \nthe policy direction and focus of the TA will be established, chaired by LGOP (with SEAC as the \nvice  chair),  comprising  members  of  the  poverty  offices  and  ethnic  affairs  commissions  at  the \nnational level and in the 11 provinces and autonomous regions involved in the TA.  At the end of the \nTA, a workshop will be held to review the results of the plan, which will be disseminated to all ", "    5     \nprovinces, prefectures, counties, townships, and villages where the 22 small minority groups live.  \nBoth the Government and ADB staff will attend the inception and final workshops and will review the \ninception, interim, and draft final reports. \n \n14.  Implementation of the TA will begin around October 2003 and will be completed over a \nperiod of 10 months until August 2004. A total of 58 person-months of consulting services (4 \ninternational and 54 domestic) will be needed to carry out the TA activities. The consultants will \nhave expertise in the fields of poverty reduction policy and participatory development planning, \nminority affairs policy, anthropology and cultural protection of minority groups, cultural economic \ndevelopment  (e.g.,  tourism,  handicraft  industry,  bilingual education), NGOs, rural infrastructure \n(roads,  power,  water  supply,  and  irrigation),  environmental  protection  and  law,  livestock  and \nagriculture,  education  and  technical  training,  and  health.  The  consultants  will  work  in  five \nsubgroups.  The  groups  will  draw  upon  additional  short-term  local  expertise  such  as  research \nacademies, universities, and NGOs to facilitate in-depth understanding of the minorities. The groups \nwill also convene expert panels with reviewers from both the private and public sectors to review \ntheir plans. These local experts and expert panel members, who will be identified during the course \nof  TA  implementation  based  on  identified  needs,  will  be  engaged  by  the  TA  consultants  in \naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.  The international experts will draw upon their \nexperience in other countries and will work with the domestic experts to draw upon relevant lessons \nlearned for the PRC. The team leader will be the domestic development planner. Given the lack of \ninternational institutes and experts knowledgeable about the 22 small minorities, a firm of domestic \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nfollowing quality and cost-based selection procedures and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used. \nInternational consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants as individuals to ensure independent inputs on international best practices and lessons \nlearned. The outline terms of references for these consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n15.  The  Fafo  Institute  for  Applied  International  Studies,  an  independent  nonprofit  research \ninstitute  in  Norway,  and  the  PRC  National  Research  Center  for  Science  and  Technology  for \nDevelopment (under the Ministry of Science and Technology) are cooperating on a western region \nliving condition survey financed by the Norwegian Government.  The survey will cover data on \nhousehold economy, food security, health, labor market participation, migration, and infrastructure \namong others.  The Fafo Institute has indicated that if the TA finances only the cost of expanding \ndata collection to cover some of the small minority areas under the TA (in the same Fafo provinces), \nthe  Fafo  Institute  will  cover  the  project  administration,  questionnaire  design,  interviewer  and \nsampler training, purchase of equipment, etc. Given the low marginal cost and high benefit of this \ncooperation in terms of establishing a baseline survey and for monitoring and evaluation during and \nafter the small minority plans are implemented, it is proposed that this activity be included as a \nsurvey activity. The Fafo Institute will be recruited under direct selection, given its ability to collect \ndata in the TA small minority areas and due to the lack of other qualified nongovernment or \nconsulting entities for such work.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $840,000 to the Government of \nthe People's Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support \nof the Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies, for Participatory \nPoverty Reduction Planning for Small Minorities, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

A group of Semu \npeople from middle Asia likely moved to the Tongren area in Qinghai during the Yuan Dynasty, \nmixed with the local Mongolians and Tibetans, and then formed the Bonan minority group. \nBonans moved from Qinghai to Gansu in the Qing Dynasty. The Bonan people are engaged \nmainly in agriculture, but also in handicraft production. In Jishishan County, where 18% of \nBonans  live,  there  are  2,430  poverty-stricken  Bonans,  6.2%  of  the  total  poverty-stricken \npopulation of the county. In 2001, the net income per capita of Bonans was Y522, 69% and 22% \nof the county average and national average levels, respectively. The county is located in a \nmountainous area, which causes difficult transport conditions. About 20 villages have no access \nto roads, and the existing roads are of low quality. About 60% of Bonans lack drinking water. \nThe Bonans have the second lowest education level in Gansu, next only to the Dongxiang \nminority group. The Bonan primary enrollment rate is 85% and every 1000 people have one \ndoctor. \n \nYugu (also known as Yugur): This group lives mainly in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous County \nand Yellow Earth Castle Yugur Township in Gansu Province. Their population is 13,719, about \n90% live in Gansu Province, with the others scattered in Beijing and Xinjiang. The history of the \nYugur started in the Tang Dynasty when the Huihu people were defeated in a fight and a group \nof Huihu moved to Hexi Corridor (Gansu Province), later forming the Yugur. Before the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) was established, Yurgurs were engaged mainly in animal husbandry. \nFrom  the  1950s,  agriculture,  industry,  mining,  and  other  trading  activities  were  developed \nquickly. Most Yugurs live in mountainous areas. Up to the early 1990s, three main roads were \nbuilt, and different grade roads were connected to each village. Among the Yugurs living in \nSunan Yugur Autonomous County, 29% are poor, accounting for 80% of the total poverty-\nstricken people of the county.
