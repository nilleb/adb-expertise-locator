In \norder to ensure the sustainable and effective use of rehabilitated and \nupgraded  irrigation  systems,  the  Project  will  (i) strengthen \ncommunity  participation  and  ownership  through  participatory \nplanning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  community-managed \nirrigation schemes and other community infrastructure; (ii) enhance \nthe  institutional  capacities  of  community  organizations  and  local \ngovernment  agencies,  and  adopt  an  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement  approach  to  planning  and  monitoring  of  irrigation \ndevelopment;  (iii) invest  in  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of \ncommunity-managed  irrigation  schemes;  and  (iv) integrate  the \nirrigation investments with demand-driven extension services. The \nProject is expected to bring about increases in irrigated land and \ncrop production both in irrigated lowlands and surrounding uplands, \nimproved  household  food  security,  crop  diversification,  and \nenhanced community livelihood in the project area. The Project will \nbe implemented in 11 districts in the provinces of Luang Prabang, \nXayabury,  Xiengkhuang,  and  Huaphanh,  and  the  Xaysomboun \nSpecial Zone. \n   \nRationale  In the northern region, prevailing subsistence farming coupled with \ndifficult access had slowed the agricultural development. The poverty \nincidence is high at 53% in the northern provinces, where many poor \nfarmers  live  by  subsistence  farming,  seasonal  agricultural  wage \nlabor,  and  shifting  cultivation.  The  use  of  productive  land  in  the \nnorthern region has not been optimized, and substantial potential for \nefficiency improvement in the use of water resources has yet to be \nexploited.  Although  the  Government  declared  the  country  as \nnationally  self-sufficient  in  rice  in  2000,  rice  insufficiency  at  the \nhousehold level persists in the northern region, where development \nof irrigation has an important mandate to improve food security and \naffordability of poor households. The Government\u2019s Strategic Vision \nfor the Agricultural Sector recognizes the lack of irrigation facilities as \na fundamental constraint to agricultural development, and its poverty \nreduction strategy aims to assure food security of poor farmers and \nenable them to diversify their cropping systems.  ", "  iii\nOver  the  past  decade,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nsupported  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  core  sector \nstrategy  to  develop  community-managed  schemes  and  promote \nirrigation  management  transfer  through  the  ongoing  Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Project (CMIS). The development impacts \nof CMIS have demonstrated the effectiveness of rehabilitation of \ncommunity-managed irrigation systems in improving food security \nand rural livelihoods by strengthening the self-help capacity of rural \ncommunities in mountainous rural areas. The Project is positioned to \nfurther assist the Government\u2019s efforts in addressing household food \ninsecurity  and  enabling  crop  diversification  by  replicating,  in  the \nnorthern  provinces,  the  successful  community-managed  irrigation \ndevelopment models tested by CMIS.  \n \nTo further improve the effectiveness and sustainability of irrigation \nfacilities over the long run, the approach to community-managed \nirrigation  development  needs  to  further  strengthen  community \ninstitutions  and  the  assistance  capacity  of  local  government \nagencies;  sharpen  participatory  dimensions  in  the  planning, \nconstruction, and maintenance of irrigation facilities; and integrate \nirrigation  investments  with  other  complementary  agricultural \ndevelopment assistance.  \n   \nObjective and Scope  The  Project  aims  to  reduce  rural  poverty  in  11  districts  of  the \nnorthern region through sustained growth of agricultural production \nby developing community-managed irrigation schemes with strong \ncommunity ownership. \n \nThe Project will provide services and activities of the following four \nproject  components  in  an  integrated  manner  to  each  subproject: \n(i) community mobilization, (ii) institutional capacity building for better \nparticipatory  planning  facilitation  and  technical  management, \n(iii) rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  community-managed  irrigation \nschemes, and (iv) agricultural extension and resource use planning.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  6  years  is  estimated  at \n$12.9 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost, \n$5.1 million or 40% is the foreign exchange cost and $7.8 million \nequivalent or 60% is the local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange Currency  Cost \nADB  5.1  4.9  10.0  77 \nGovernment  0.0  1.9  1.9  15 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  1.0  1.0  8 \n Total  5.1  7.8  12.9  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nLoan Amount and  A loan of SDR 6.864 million ($10 million equivalent) will be made \nTerms  from ADB's Asian Development Fund resources and will have a term ", "iv   \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.

Project management units of participating provinces \nwill be responsible for day-to-day decision-making, with activities at \nthe subproject level devolved to the extent possible to the district \nagriculture and forestry service offices and water user associations. \nOverall coordination of the Project will be undertaken by the national \nproject steering committee to be chaired by the vice minister of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry, and provincial-level coordination \nwill be carried out by provincial-level steering committees chaired by \nthe vice governors. At the community level, water user groups and \nother farmer groups will be established at each subproject site during \nthe first year, and at least one man and one woman from each \nvillage will be appointed as community-level organizers, who will act \nas focal points for project implementation in each community. More \nthan 12 months of lead time will be spent discussing the project \nconcept with participating communities; formulating village groups \naccording to their interests; implementing the selected community \nactivities;  designing  and  planning  irrigation  rehabilitation;  and \nupgrading  water  user  groups  into  water  user  associations. \nSubprojects will be selected in phases (10\u201313 subprojects per year) \nin accordance with the subproject selection criteria, which ensure \nthat  the  Project  will  finance  irrigation  scheme  development  that \n(i) significantly  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  through  improving \nfood security, (ii) efficiently increases cropping areas, (iii) is based on \nstrong community initiatives and ownership, and (vi) is socially and \nenvironmentally sound. \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  related  services  valued  at  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding, \nand those valued at $500,000 or less through international shopping \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Off-the-shelf \nitems including vehicles, equipment, and materials valued at less \nthan $100,000 may be procured through direct purchase. Civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $1 million will be procured by \ninternational competitive bidding, and contracts costing $1 million or \nless will be procured through local competitive bidding.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 57 person-months of international and 230 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for  project ", "  v\nmanagement and a number of technical inputs. The consultants will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Approximately 30 irrigation schemes serving roughly 1,900 hectares \nBeneficiaries  of command area will be developed and provided with an integrated \npackage of essential investments required to increase agricultural \nproduction.  About  37,000  rural  villagers  are  expected  to  benefit \ndirectly from the Project, of whom at least 60% are poor farmers.  \n \nThe families with irrigable lowland, about 2,700 of them, will be the \nmain beneficiaries of irrigation facilities upgraded under the Project. \nThey  are  subsistence  farmers  who  experience  an  average  of  4 \nmonths of rice insufficiency per year, and sometimes practice shifting \ncultivation in the uplands to support their livelihoods. Families who \ndo not have access to irrigated areas, numbering about 4,800, will \nbenefit  from  community  development  activities  and  extension \nservices for upland and rain-fed agriculture.  \n \nThe most important overall impact of the Project will be an increase \nin food production and the potential for raising household incomes. \nBy upgrading small-scale irrigation schemes, the Project is expected \nto (i) ensure better irrigation water management, thereby increasing \nwet-season paddy yields; (ii) enable crop diversification and double \ncropping in the dry season; (iii) reduce the workload for the regular \nrepair of diversion weirs; (iv) halt the cutting down of trees for weir \nrepairs; and (v) expand irrigation command areas for both the wet \nand  dry  season  due  to  better  diversion  control  and  improved \ndistribution systems. The economic internal rates of return calculated \nfor potential subprojects range from 12% to 19%. \n   \nRisks and  Potential risks that may undermine the project impacts center around \nAssumptions  institution-building challenges including (i) limited human resources \nand budgetary allocation made available for relevant province and \ndistrict  agriculture  and  forestry  service  offices  to  support  project \nactivities in the field, and (ii) the degree of maturity of community \norganization  development.  With  regard  to  the  implementation \ncapacity  risk  of  the  Department  of  Irrigation  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Forestry as well as the project management units, \nthe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases  to  ease  the \nadministrative work burden and to enable delivery of high-quality \nassistance for implementation of each subproject. \n ", "", "", "", "", "", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Northern Community-Managed \nIrrigation Sector Project (the Project).1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Agriculture in the Northern Region \n \n2.  The Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Mekong region, with an estimated \nper capita income of $310. The total population of the country is 5.5 million, of whom about 30% \nlive below the national poverty line.2 While sound progress in reducing poverty is being made, \nthe strategic thrust and priority of the country\u2019s long-term socioeconomic development remains \nthe  reduction  of  the  prevailing  high  poverty  incidence.  To  this  end,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES)  and  aims  to \ngraduate from least-developed country status by 2020. The country strategy and program of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) is oriented to helping implement the NGPES, including the \npreparation of the Northern Region Development Strategy, which highlights the geographic \nadvantage and growing trading opportunities in the northern region with neighboring countries. \nBordering southern People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, the \nnorthern region has been historically the central hub for regional trade that connects important \nroutes between the PRC and Southeast Asia. With the recent substantial development of the \nregion\u2019s  road  network,  regional  agricultural  trade  offers  increasingly  tangible  business \nopportunities for some agricultural commodities (para. 23).  \n \n3.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the Lao PDR, accounting for 50% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and employing 80% of the total labor force. While the sector covers various \neconomic activities ranging from rice farming for subsistence to agro-processing industries, rice \ncultivation is the single most prevalent economic activity in the country, and rice is grown over \nabout 639,000 hectares (ha), or 72% of the total cultivated area. Rice is the staple food source, \nwhich accounts for about 67% of daily calorie intake for much of the rural population. The \nagriculture sector\u2019s development has significant implications for poverty reduction efforts in the \ncountry, as the overwhelming majority of the rural population are subsistence farmers (75%), \nwho experience on average 4 months of rice insufficiency a year. Over the past decade, the \ndevelopment  of  irrigation  facilities  has  been  the  driving  force  of  agricultural  growth  in  the \ncountry, and increased irrigated crop production, particularly during the dry season, has helped \nlift national rice production to the level of self-sufficiency. However, significant rice insufficiency \nat the household level persists, particularly in the northern region, due to the low productivity of \nthe land in the region and the low degree of integration among various domestic markets and \ndistribution systems in the country.  \n \n4.  Poverty incidence in the northern region is high at 53%. A population of just over \n2 million live in the northern region, and currently little more than 10% of the population are \nurbanized. Farmers in the northern region typically face up to 6 months of rice insufficiency in a \nyear. Limited farmland and its low productivity have kept upland communities in a state of food \n                                                 \n1  Appendix 1 sets out the project framework.  \n2  Based on preliminary results of the 2002/03 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey. The poverty headcount for \nthe country has fallen from 38.6% in 1997/98 to about 30% in 2002/03. ", "2 \ninsecurity. Irrigable flat lands are limited to valley floors in the mountainous areas with the \naverage irrigated area per household rarely exceeding 0.5 ha. Consequently, many farmers \ncultivate lowlands as well as uplands, where shifting cultivation is usually practiced in a situation \nof ever-shorter fallow periods. In most of the lowland areas, single wet-season rice cropping is \nthe norm, and traditional glutinous varieties are grown. Under rain-fed upland conditions, rice \nand corn are commonly grown using shifting cultivation. Various levels of crop diversification are \nseen during the dry season, largely depending on water availability.  \n \n 5.  Facing insufficiency of rice, the foremost concern of poor farmers is to improve their \nlevels of rice sufficiency.3 Rural households in the northern provinces typically make up for the \nrice shortfall by collecting forestry products for consumption and income generation. Another \nmeans  to  alleviate  the  rice  deficit  is  seasonal  hiring  of  farm  wage  laborers  during  the \ntransplanting and harvesting seasons, and the sale of cash crops. Attracted by higher wages \noffered  in  neighboring  countries,  laborers  face  incentives  to  cross  the  border  to  work, \nparticularly  during  seasonal  demand  peaks  for  unskilled  labor.  At  present,  once-abundant \nforestry resources are showing signs of dwindling through overexploitation, and foraging to \nsupplement food requirements is becoming increasingly difficult. Livestock production provides \na means of saving and a coping mechanism during hardship as a major source of substantial \ncash  earnings.4  With  such  earnings,  rural  households  buy  rice  to  satisfy  some  of  their \nconsumption needs. Although the volume is limited, surplus rice of both glutinous and non-\nglutinous kinds is traded locally during the harvest season, and local rice millers and traders sell \nrice varieties imported from southern PRC, Thailand, and Viet Nam, during the wet season, \nwhen the supply of local rice becomes scarce.5  \n \n6.  While the northern region is mountainous and arable valley floors are relatively small, \nthe use of productive land has not been optimized and the potential for efficiency improvement \nof water resources is yet to be exploited. The northern region is endowed with streams often \nwith small catchment areas, where many traditional weirs have been constructed to divert water \nto  small  adjacent  paddy  fields.  Existing  irrigation  schemes  provide  water  and  water \nmanagement to only approximately 36% of the total cultivated area during the wet season. The \nuse of dry-season irrigation is still rare due to inefficiency and limited scope for expansion of \ntraditional irrigation schemes. Typical yields of rain-fed upland and lowland rice are 1.5 and 2.0 \ntons (t)/ha, respectively. This compares with a national average of 2\u20133 t/ha for lowland wet-\nseason crops, and 3\u20134 t/ha for dry-season irrigated crops,6 which are also relatively low when \ncompared with levels elsewhere in Asia. Both the upland and lowland cropping practices are \nbased on a system of minimum inputs: fertilizer inputs are low, pesticide use is minimal, and \nmechanization  is  almost  nonexistent.  Traditional  varieties  predominate  in  all  cropping \nenvironments.  \n \n2.  Irrigation Subsector \n \n7.  The estimated 22,240 irrigation systems service a total area of about 280,000 ha, and \nirrigated agricultural production accounts for about 65% of total agricultural production in the \ncountry.7 The most numerous irrigation systems are small-scale schemes with traditional weirs, \n                                                 \n3  The single most important need unequivocally identified by farmers of all ethnic groups in the project provinces is \nimproved rice production. \n4  For instance, the sale of one head of buffalo or cattle often provides a family of four to five members with rice for a \nyear. \n5  A study of the National Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute and the International Rice Research Institute in \nMarch 2002 reported that the amount of rice traded in the Lao PDR is less than 10% of production because most \nof the rice produced is consumed by producers themselves. \n6  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 2003. Agricultural Statistical Book 2002. \n7  Statistics of Irrigation 2000, Department of Irrigation, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Vientiane. ", "  3 \nand a total of 18,150 schemes are located in the mountainous areas.8 Traditional irrigation \nfacilities typically use primitive weirs and intake structures made of logs and soil, which need \nfrequent  repair  during  the  rainy  season.  They  provide  supplementary  irrigation  water  that \nexpands the cropping area and assures continuous water delivery during the wet season.9 \nWater use efficiency of the traditional schemes is very low, particularly during the dry season, \ndue to high seepage and conveyance loss. Large pump schemes that are suitable for high-\nvalue cash crop production are only prevalent in the lowlands, where there are large areas of \nirrigable land with good physical access to markets.  \n \n8.  Past investments made to rehabilitate community-managed irrigation (CMI) schemes in \nthe  country  have  demonstrated  their  effectiveness  in  improving  food  security  and  rural \nlivelihoods by strengthening the self-help capacity of rural communities in mountainous rural \nareas.  The  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project  (CMIS)10  has  assisted  the \nrehabilitation of 47 small-scale CMI schemes with a command area of 3,720 ha, and reduced \npoverty among project beneficiaries by generating substantial increases in household incomes \nand per capita paddy production in the project area.11 The incremental agricultural activities \nwere derived from an expanded cropping area, enhanced crop yields, and crop diversification.12 \nSuch  a  community-driven  poverty  reduction  approach  is  central  to  the  NGPES,  which \nencourages investments to modernize agricultural production of poor farmers so as to meet \ntheir subsistence needs, and eventually help them to diversify into higher-value crop production. \nHaving recognized the increased efficiency and lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \nachieved by CMI scheme rehabilitation, the Government is promoting CMI scheme development \nand irrigation management transfer as a core sector development strategy (Appendix 2). \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Government Strategy for Agriculture Development  \n \n9.  Unlike  the  diversified  lowland  agriculture  along  the  Mekong  corridor,  prevailing \nsubsistence farming, coupled with access difficulties and the lack of a viable rural finance \nsystem, limited the opportunities to advance agriculture in the northern region in the past. \nConsequently, the productivity of land and water resources remains below its potential today. \nThe Government\u2019s Strategic Vision for the Agricultural Sector recognizes the lack of irrigation \nfacilities as a fundamental constraint to agricultural development, which needs to be corrected in \norder to improve the affordability and livelihood of subsistence farmers. The rehabilitation of \nirrigation facilities in a manner that fully observes sustainable practices is an effective and \nproven way to improve agricultural production over the medium term through enhancing the \nproductivity of their resource endowment. Furthermore, with current major aid agency support to \nimprove the road network, rural finance system, and extension system, CMI facility rehabilitation \nwill form a crucial foundation for shifting subsistence agriculture to a commercial farming system \n                                                 \n8  The Department of Irrigation defines schemes with a service area up to 100 ha as small-scale irrigation schemes, \nthose of 100\u2013500 ha as medium-scale irrigation schemes, and those of 500 ha and above as large irrigation \nschemes. \n9  Surface water is usually utilized for such irrigation system, and little is known of the potential for the use of \nalternative water sources, such as groundwater and the deep aquifers. \n10  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \nPDR for the Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project. Manila. \n11  Poverty as measured by the number of rice-deficit households has fallen from about 40% in 1998 to close to zero \nin 2002. Over this period, average annual per capita paddy production increased from 223 kg to 570 kg, and \naverage annual household cash income from KN540,000 to KN3.6 million. \n12  The yield improvement originates from greater yield stability generated by supplementary irrigation during periods \nof low rainfall. Irrigated conditions also complement the effectiveness of soil fertility improvement technologies and \nthe use of improved seeds. ", "4 \nby expanding the cropping area, improving crop yields, and enabling crop diversification through \ndry-season irrigation.13 This approach is consistent with the principle of the Country Strategy \nand Program (2004\u20132006) of ADB, which is promoting agricultural diversification and income \ngeneration in poor rural areas. \n \n2.  Sustainability of Community-Managed Irrigation Schemes \n \n10.  Notwithstanding the viability of CMI schemes in enhancing agricultural production, the \nsustainable operation of CMI schemes beyond the period of funding agency investments has \nbeen a major challenge for the Government, major funding agencies, and nongovernment \norganizations in the sector (Appendix 3). In general, small weirs for CMI are designed to meet \nthe once-in-50-year flood criteria in the country. The sustainability of rehabilitated irrigation \nschemes depends largely on (i) continuous participation of communities in water management \nand O&M of the schemes, (ii) technical and management ability of water user associations \n(WUAs),  (iii) ability  of  local  government  agencies  to  provide  required  support  to  WUAs, \n(iv) financial affordability by farmers, and (v) watershed protection to minimize siltation of weirs \nand canals. While the fiscal budget allocation for O&M of irrigation schemes is inadequate to \ncover  the  requirements  of  all  irrigation  schemes,  much  of  the  physical  and  financial \nrequirements for O&M can be met by community contributions. \n \n11.  Community Participation and Ownership. The degree of community participation and \nownership is highly relevant to O&M performance. Limited community consultation is likely to \nresult in a low level of awareness among WUA members of O&M responsibility. Thus, strategic \ninvestments in developing community institutions and generating incentives for participation and \nownership  among  farmers  from  an  early  stage  are  critical  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nirrigation schemes. To this end, local government\u2019s assistance for villagers is significant. Sector \nexperience also indicates that participatory development of community assets that will benefit \nthe entire community, such as access roads and domestic water supply, are good at attracting \nthe active participation of all villagers, enhance further the development impacts of CMI scheme \nrehabilitation, and facilitate the selection of the most suitable scheme design and alignment by \nencouraging village walks and discussions.  \n \n12.  Operation and Maintenance. It is imperative that participating communities become \nfully aware of their O&M responsibilities and the level of community contribution required, prior \nto their involvement in the Project, so that they can design and select schemes for which they \ncan afford the O&M requirements. For a small-scale irrigation scheme of about 60\u2013100 ha, the \nmaintenance works required to ensure its sustainable use are (i) routine maintenance that \ninvolves desilting and weeding of weir and canals, which can be managed by farmer labor; \n(ii) periodic maintenance,14 which is expected every 15 years and requires both labor and \nimported  materials;  and  (iii) emergency  maintenance  that  should  be  conducted  by  the \nGovernment  to  repair  the  damage  caused  by  natural  calamities.  Routine  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated weirs and canals requires significantly less labor than that required in the wet \nseason for the yearly reconstruction and extensive repairs of traditional weirs. The required \npurchase of imported materials (wire or concrete) will be financed by the irrigation service fee \n(ISF) to be collected over the long term, and farmers will obtain the technical skills required for \n                                                 \n13  The Strategic Vision for the Agricultural Sector, adopted in 1999, aims to achieve household food security and \ndiversification of farming systems in rural sloping-land communities through expanding irrigated agriculture by \n2020. The Project will contribute to the achievement of midterm goals in increasing CMI schemes, improving wet-\nseason  rice  yield,  expanding  dry-season  irrigation,  and  enhancing  household  income  through  farming \ndiversification by 2010. \n14  Lacing of wire nets in the case of gabion schemes, or fixing cracks and wears of concrete structures in the case of \nreinforced concrete weirs. ", "  5 \nperiodic maintenance by participating in the rehabilitation works of weirs and canals. Better \nwater-flow control, enabled by managing lift gates of modern weirs and canal structures, will \nalso reduce the scope of routine and periodic maintenance significantly by avoiding damage \nfrom flash floods and overtopping of sidewalls and embankments.  \n \n13.  At present, WUAs collect a level of ISFs affordable to farmers without giving adequate \nconsideration to the estimated cost of long-term maintenance. WUAs collect and deposit ISFs in \nbank accounts to be utilized for future maintenance expenditures. The current ISF level may risk \nthe sustainability of rehabilitated irrigation schemes since the amounts collected may not be \nenough for future maintenance works. Feasibility studies of potential subprojects illustrate the \namount that farmers can afford for ISFs that cover the cash expenditures on both routine and \nperiodic maintenance\u2014approximately KN189,000 per ha, which accounts for about 10% of \nexpected  incremental  financial  net  income  per  ha.  Therefore,  ISF  collection  performance \ndepends largely on farmers\u2019 willingness to pay. Hence, it is indispensable that local government \nagencies (i) provide adequate technical assistance for participating communities in selecting the \nleast-cost option by estimating future O&M costs; and (ii) during the initial discussions, clearly \nexplain  to  communities,  and  confirm  their  willingness  to  pay,  the  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance costs for which they will be responsible.  \n \n14.  Community Management Capacity. Upgrading of traditional irrigation schemes without \nchanging the basic designs has proven to be the best way to minimize institutional challenges \nimposed  on  the  use  of  rehabilitated  schemes  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  vast  majority  of  CMI \nrehabilitation investments just replaced traditional weirs with permanent structures at the same \nlocations and extended existing canals because farmers are used to the existing schemes, \neasily understand the benefit of upgrading, and already have management systems for the \ndiversion and distribution of irrigation water over the command areas. Many traditional weirs \nhave been constructed with village initiatives and are well maintained by communities under the \nleadership of village chiefs, despite a high labor requirement for frequent repairs. In contrast, the \nmanagement of rehabilitated schemes requires more careful O&M planning, as some cash \nexpenditures for imported materials are required for periodic maintenance works, which need to \nbe financed through the collection of ISFs. In order for WUAs to improve their capacity to \nmanage the planning required, technical assistance of local government agencies is essential, \nparticularly  in  (i) planning  ISF  collection  based  on  estimated  O&M  expenditures,  and \n(ii) managing the collected ISF funds. The establishment of a system that allows farmers to \nevaluate the management of village activities is also indispensable to maintain transparency \nand farmers\u2019 incentives to sustain the irrigation development activities.15  \n \n15.  Community Solidarity Development. It is important to combine livelihood improvement \nactivities that are complementary to irrigation development, ensure an equitable distribution of \nbenefits generated within each community, and provide incentives for the whole village to \nparticipate in irrigation development initiatives. Irrigation interventions alone tend to exclude the \nmost vulnerable groups within participating villages, as the poorest farmers usually have limited \naccess to irrigable land. Exclusion of the poorest groups has risks of worsening the inequalities \nthat  already  exist  in  communities,  as  well  as  affecting  the  development  of  sustainable \ncommunity organizations necessary for the long-term O&M of irrigation facilities. By combining \nvillage livelihood activities, irrigation rehabilitation can also assist in forming a new leadership \nwithin participating communities that represents wider interests of villagers (Appendix 4). \n \n                                                 \n15  WUAs  need  to  develop  democratic  and  effective  management  mechanisms  through  the  establishment  of \nmanagement committees with periodically elected members, bookkeeping, and group discussions for major \ndecisions. ", "6 \n16.  Integrated  Water  Resource  Management.  The  Water  Resource  Coordination \nCommittee (WRCC) is the national coordination body responsible for river basin development \nplanning in the country. While water conflict among irrigation schemes is not an issue during the \nwet season at present due to abundant water flow and a small amount diverted at each weir, \ncareful  consideration  needs  to  be  given  in  selecting  subprojects  for  potential  effects  on \ndownstream water users to avoid water conflicts and to optimize the use of common water. To \nensure  sustainable  use  of  water  resources,  CMI  development  needs  to  be  planned  and \nmonitored by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) in close consultation with WRCC.  \n \n17.  Integration of Catchment Rehabilitation Activities. Streams in mountainous areas \nare frequently experiencing shorter and higher wet-season flows, and longer and lower dry-\nseason flows. These changes have direct effects on irrigated agriculture in the valley floors of \nmountainous areas. The changes reflect activities within catchments, including poorly regulated \ncommercial logging and nontraditional shifting cultivation, both of which are leading to the \ncatchments' degradation and affecting stream flows. Support for the rehabilitation of catchments \nadjacent to irrigation scheme areas is expected to contribute to the sustainable use of CMI \nschemes and to complement upland agricultural activities.16  \n \n3.  Institutional Framework \n \n18.  The  competency  in  technical  aspects  of  agriculture  and  irrigation,  and  project \nimplementation capacity of DOI and local government staff, appears to be adequate, and they \nhave acquired relevant field experience necessary for CMI development through successfully \nimplementing CMIS and the Decentralized Irrigation Development and Management Project \n(DIDM).17 DOI is the primary agency responsible for irrigation development in the country, and \nhas been facilitating the development of CMI schemes for over a decade. By promoting the \nestablishment  of  a  WUA  in  each  irrigation  scheme  and  technically  supporting  provincial \nirrigation  service  offices  located  in  18  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  service  offices \n(PAFSOs),  DOI  has  efficiently  expanded  the  outreach  of  irrigation  services.  However,  the \nfacilitation of active community participation and a more integrated approach to agricultural \ndevelopment  assistance  call  for  further  improvement  of  local  government  staff  in  social \nintermediation skills and technical knowledge relevant to extension services. At the same time, \nWUAs and village leaders need to strengthen their coordination system with local government \nagencies in order to take advantage of the most relevant and appropriate technical assistance \nfor their villages. In recognition of the challenging task, the Government has committed to \n(i) assign  at  least  four  PAFSO  staff  and  two  district  agriculture  and  forestry  service  office \n(DAFSO)  staff  to  the  Project  in  each  participating  province  and  district  to  the  Project; \n(ii) establish coordination linkages with district Lao Women\u2019s Unions (DLWUs) and community-\nlevel  organizers  (CLOs)  in  villages;  and  (iii) allocate  a  substantial  budget  for  recurrent \nexpenditures, which is essential to support critical field works.  \n \n4.  Sector Policy and Regulatory Issues  \n \n19.  During the past decade, ADB has assisted the Government in supporting the creation of \nan enabling regulatory environment, in institutional strengthening, and in project investments for \nCMI development. CMIS has been instrumental in creating an adequate regulatory setting for \n                                                 \n16  The CMIS pilot tested catchment rehabilitation activities such as forage, tree plantation, and other cropping on \nmoderately sloping lands surrounding the irrigation schemes. \n17  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \nPDR for the Decentralized Irrigation Development and Management Project. Manila. The CMIS staff gained \nsubstantial experience in selecting a suitable scheme in accordance with the selection criteria, conducting \nfeasibility and impact studies, establishing WUAs, and making construction and O&M arrangements with farmers. ", "  7 \nWUA  establishment  and  improving  household  food  security  in  the  central  and  northern \nprovinces, while the DIDM has assisted in implementing the irrigation management transfer \npolicy and promoting the commercialization of agriculture in the lowlands. Subsequently, the \nNam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project18 introduced river basin-based integrated \nwater resource management to the irrigation subsector. The Project is positioned to further \nassist the Government\u2019s efforts in addressing household food insecurity and enabling crop \ndiversification by replicating, in the northern provinces, the successful CMI development models \ntested by CMIS.  \n \n20.  To  further  strengthen  sustainability  and  effectiveness  of  the  development  of  CMI \nschemes under the Project, empowerment of community organizations and development of \ninstitutional capacity at local government agencies are essential. Accordingly, the Government \nhas improved the relevant policy and regulatory environment in three major areas. First, it \nissued a ministerial guideline to the irrigation management transfer policy No. 0672 in August \n2003 in order to (i) focus the payment responsibility of WUAs with small-scale schemes on the \nISFs that will fully cover future O&M costs, not on the repayment of the rehabilitation capital \ncosts; (ii) allow each WUA to decide its ISF level based on its future maintenance requirement; \nand (iii) clarify that the WUA\u2019s responsibility covers only  routine and periodic maintenance \nworks.19 With the guideline in place, local government staff and farmers can now delineate a \nclear division of maintenance responsibilities prior to the construction of irrigation schemes and \nstipulate these responsibilities in the WUA registration documents accordingly. Second, as an \nessential step of agricultural resource use planning, the Government agreed to (i) exercise the \nequitable  and  participatory  village  consultation  process  in  allocating  land  use  rights20  and \n(ii) accord the grace period for land tax collection in accordance with Prime Minister\u2019s Decree \nNo. 150.  Land  use  planning  and  allocation  are  fundamental  requirements  both  to  ensure \nproductive use of uplands by generating incentives for farmers to invest their efforts, and to \nwiden project benefits to cover entire project communities. Third, as a measure to implement \nthe Water Law and relevant decrees, DOI will establish an institutional linkage with WRCC \nthrough  water  requirement  surveys,  consultation  for  future  irrigation development  planning, \nhydrologic data sharing, and eventually application for water use rights for each subproject.21 \nThis linkage will enable the introduction of integrated water resource management approach \ninto the project implementation, and avoid potential conflicts over water allocation that may arise \nin the future (Appendix 2).  \n \n5.  Integration of Extension Assistance \n \n21.  While improving water availability through upgraded irrigation facilities is an effective tool \nin  itself  for  increasing  agricultural  production,  further  agricultural  production  gains  can  be \nachieved  when  a  well-designed  agricultural  extension  program  complements  irrigation \nimprovement. Various research and extension development initiatives exist in the country to \ndevelop proven production-enhancing technologies and measures to minimize preharvest and \npostharvest losses for both irrigated areas and uplands in the northern region.22 By collaborating \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \nPDR for the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project. Manila. \n19  The Government will provide assistance for repairs made necessary as a result of floods or other natural disasters \n(force majeure).   \n20  As stipulated in MAF instruction No. 0822 issued in August 1996. \n21  The Water Law was adopted in October 1996 and Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 204 was issued in October 2001 to \nguide law enforcement. \n22  Relevant  ongoing  assistance  in  the  country  includes  the  development  of  improved  varieties,  soil  fertility \nmanagement, rodent management, and upland agriculture development managed by the Lao International Rice \nResearch Institute, the Integrated Upland agriculture Research Project, and Centre de cooperation internationale \nen recherche agronomique pour le developpement.  ", "8 \nwith such existing research and extension development initiatives, irrigation rehabilitation will \nmore effectively support (i) substantial yield improvements of both lowland and upland crops \nand  (ii) introduction  of  double  cropping  in  lowlands  during  the  dry  season  in  northern \nprovinces.23 Due to considerably diverse farming conditions in the northern region, no single \nmodel for agricultural extension services can meet the requirements of all farmers. Hence, \nextension assistance packages need to be tailored to suit local conditions, and need to be \nintroduced with active interaction between CLOs and DAFSO/PAFSO staff to reflect the priority \nneeds and capacity of poor beneficiaries.  \n \n6.  Marketing Opportunities \n  \n22.  In  general,  farmers  are  generally  well  informed  on  the  marketability  and  prices  of \nagricultural products, and capable of making their own decisions on what is best to grow based \non the information they have. Farmers in the project area obtain marketing information, such as \nprices and marketability of cash crops, and price differences between the farmgate prices and \nthe district or provincial market prices, through interactions with traders and occasional visits to \nmarkets. They have physical access to markets at least during the dry season when cash \ncropping and trading are carried out.24 Trading opportunities for surplus produce are often \nprovided by the village visits of local traders and periodic roadside markets. Villagers also walk \nor occasionally take local buses to go to market to sell their produce, especially when they have \na larger volume of produce to sell, but prefer to trade with buyers in their villages because \ntransport costs tend to cancel out any additional gains they may obtain from their sales at the \nmarket. \n \n23.  With  increased  water  availability,  associated  extension  services,  and  access \nimprovement  to  the  nearest  road  links,  farmers  are  expected  to  respond  to  the  existing \nopportunities  reasonably  well.  Some  districts  have  a  considerable  market  potential  for \ndiversification implied by the presence of a substantial size of existing regional trade of maize \nand other grain crops. Though far away from the country\u2019s capital, some subprojects are close \nto international borders, where significant informal exports of cash crops are prevalent. The \nNorthern Region Development Strategy25 reports that the major export destinations for grain \ncrops, vegetables, and nontimber forestry products produced in the project area are Thailand, \nViet Nam, and southern PRC. The recent road network improvement in the northern region \nseems to have improved such marketing opportunities further.26  \n \n7.  Lessons Learned \n \n24.  The implementation experience of CMIS and other aid agency-funded projects in the \ncountry underscored the relevance and effectiveness of CMI development in reducing poverty \nand  improving  food  security  through  strengthening  the  self-help  capacity  of  poor  farmers \n(Supplementary Appendix G). A special evaluation study of CMIS concluded that participatory \nirrigation scheme development is feasible and can contribute strongly to poverty reduction and \nfood security through increasing agricultural production and household income.27 The strengths \n                                                 \n23  An agricultural evaluation suggests a potential of over 50% yield gain for lowland rice and upland corn during the \nwet season, and double cropping of vegetables and corn during the dry season within 5 years in the project area. \nSee Supplementary Appendix I for details. \n24  Many of the potential subprojects have unsealed road access to district markets, and in some cases provincial \nmarkets. In more remote locations, river access by boat is possible, by which farmers go to market to purchase \ngoods for agricultural and household use. \n25  ADB. 2004.

", "  9 \nof project design of CMIS are found in its participatory approach and in its focus on interventions \naddressing the most important production constraints of poor farmers, namely expansion of \npaddy  land  and  enhancement  of  land  productivity.28  The  importance  of  the  participatory \ndimension to all management functions has also been widely shared by international experience \nin  promoting  participatory  irrigation  management.29  Building  community  ownership  through \nfacilitation of beneficiary participation from the early stages of project design appears to be the \nkey to ensuring effective and sustainable use of irrigation facilities. \n \n25.  A relevant lesson learned from CMIS is that a participatory approach requires substantial \nlead-in time to allow meaningful field discussions to take place and to nurture community group \ndevelopment, and the Project\u2019s implementation schedule needs to be adjusted accordingly. \nOther major lessons learned from CMIS suggest that greater attention should be paid to (i) an \nintegrated approach by combining irrigation services with agricultural and rural development \nactivities directed to the needs of local farmers both to effectively achieve the objective of \nincreased production and to widen participation and benefit sharing throughout participating \ncommunities; (ii) efforts of local government agencies to systematically facilitate beneficiary \nconsultations;  and  (iii) technical  and  managerial  support  for  communities,  integrated  water \nresource management, and catchment area rehabilitation to ensure sustainable use of irrigation \nschemes. To fortify sustainability, institution-building support should be extended more to district \ngovernment staff as well as to village leaders and representatives. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n \n26.  The project goal is to reduce rural poverty in 11 districts in the northern provinces \nthrough  sustained  agricultural  growth.  The  immediate  objective  is  to  increase  agricultural \nproduction and income-earning opportunities in the project area through the development of \nCMI schemes with strong community ownership. To meet the daunting challenge of agricultural \ndevelopment in the northern region, a phased approach over the long term must be employed. \nAs a first step, the rehabilitation of irrigation facilities will help satisfy the subsistence needs of \nthe rural poor population, and prepare them for crop diversification by strengthening their self-\nhelp capacity. \n \n27.  The project area will involve 11 districts in the provinces of Luang Prabang, Xayabury, \nXiengKhuang, and Huaphanh, and the Xaysomboun Special Zone.30 The project target areas \nhave  been  selected,  based  on  considerations  of  food  insecurity,  technical  feasibility, \nimplementation capacity of local government agencies, and the Government\u2019s development \npriorities. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n28.  The  Project  will  comprise  the  following  components:  (i) community  mobilization, \n(ii) institutional  capacity  building  for  better  participatory  planning  facilitation  and  technical \nmanagement, (iii) CMI investment, and (iv) agricultural extension and resource use planning.  \n \n                                                 \n28  The evaluation reports of other funding agencies\u2019 rural development projects in the country emphasize that \nmeeting food sufficiency needs is a precondition for introducing any alternative economic activities in rural areas. \n29  World Bank Institute. 2000. Case Studies in Participatory Irrigation Management. Washington, DC. \n30  The project districts are Luang Prabang, Nam Bak, Ngoi of Luang Prabang province, Paklai and Thong Mixay of \nXayabury province, Sobbao and Viengxai of Houaphan province, Khoun and Kham of Xiengkhuang province, and \nPhoun and Xaisomboun of Xaisomboun Special Zone. Of the 11 districts, three are categorized as the poorest \ndistricts in the country, while another three are categorized as poor districts according to the NGPES. ", "10 \n1.  Community Mobilization Component \n \n29.  The community mobilization component will formulate the social bases for identifying, \nplanning, and implementing sustainable irrigation schemes; various community activities will be \nintroduced  as  a  first  step.  This  process  will  provide  farmers  with  incentives  for  active \nparticipation in the Project by immediately benefiting all in the participating communities, and \npromote farmers with common interests to commence collective community activities in groups. \nDuring the initial stage, options for community activities, such as agricultural extension services \nfor irrigated land and uplands, rural access road upgrading, and rural water supply schemes, will \nbe presented to participating villages to allow them to select and plan implementation and \nmaintenance arrangements. This process will allow time to interact with the communities to gain \na better understanding of potential irrigation facility rehabilitation and other project activities. The \ncomponent will be implemented according to the community participation development plan. \nFarmer production groups and water user groups (WUGs) are expected to emerge as the \nparticipating villages implement community-related initiatives.  \n \n30.  Where there are needs for improved rural water supply facilities, the Project will support \nthe development of hillside springs and reticulate water to selected points within the villages, as \nwell as the construction of sanitary wells, which would be lined with concrete rings and fitted \nwith simple suction hand pumps. As the social organization required for planning and managing \ndomestic water supply schemes is similar to that required for WUAs, the Project will assist in \nestablishing WUGs to manage both irrigation and domestic water to enable a holistic approach \nto water resource management, where feasible. The construction of deep wells with high-lift \npumps will not be considered due to (i) high cost, (ii) difficulty in reaching remote sites with \nconstruction equipment, (iii) lack of hydrogeological information, and (iv) lack of arrangements \nfor the maintenance of wells and pumps.  \n \n31.  The Project expects to finance the upgrading of a total of about 30 km of village access \nroads to link irrigation schemes and project communities with the closest road networks. The \nbetter road access is a critical factor to lead the irrigation development and extension activities \nto enhanced agricultural production. Road design standards will be in accordance with the new \nClass  VIII  standards  for  roads,  with  average  daily  traffic  of  less  than  20.31  Based  on  the \nInternational  Labour  Organization\u2019s  guidelines  for  labor-based  road  construction,  simplified \ntechnical specifications and bidding documents will be used to avoid complexity and reduce \nconstruction costs. \n \n2.  Institutional Capacity-Building Component \n \n32.  Institutional capacity-building support will be focused on the village and district levels to \nsupport  participatory  irrigation  and  community  activity  development.  Assistance  for  local \ngovernment  agencies  has  been  proposed  based  on  a  careful  assessment  of  institutional \ncapacity-building needs, and in consideration of CMIS implementation experience and other \nagencies\u2019 support. The training program required for DAFSO and PAFSO staff covers three \nmajor areas: (i) facilitation of participatory planning with farmers and development of community \norganizations, and support for establishment and strengthening of WUG/WUAs; (ii) technical \ntraining for CMI scheme construction and management, O&M planning, the latest agricultural \nextension technologies, and resource use planning activities; and (iii) accounting, environmental \nimpact  evaluation,  resettlement  monitoring,  and  facilitation  of  gender-sensitive  village \ndiscussions. At the community level, training and assistance will be required on WUG formation \n                                                 \n31  Class VIII roads have a carriage width of 2.0\u20132.5 meters, a formation width of 2.5\u20134.0 meters, and a right of way \nfrom the center line of the carriageway of 2.0\u20135.0 meters. ", "  11 \nand upgrading of WUAs; planning and implementation of agricultural extension activities; and \ntraining required for upgrading rural access roads, recording and monitoring group activities, \nplanning and implementing O&M, and WUA management of ISF collection and utilization. Local \nstudy  trips  and  experience-sharing  workshops  to  cross-feed  best  practices  will  also  be \nsupported to strengthen the working relationships among PAFSOs, DAFSOs, and villages. \n \n3.  Community-Managed Irrigation Investment Component \n \n33.  The Project expects to rehabilitate about 30 irrigation schemes, and the scope of civil \nworks includes (i) replacement of traditional weirs by permanent structures (reinforced concrete \nand  stone  masonry),  (ii) improvement  of  canal  systems  with  reinforced  concrete  canal \nstructures, (iii) repairs of problematic canal sections such as leaks and cross-drainage, and \n(iv) construction of new canals where expansion of the command area is possible. Irrigation \ndesign will follow DOI standards, and locally available standard designs for weirs and canal \nstructures will be used, as they are appropriate for labor-based construction.32 Long lengths of \nconveyance canal will be avoided where possible.  \n \n34.  Active participation of the beneficiaries will be sought during the survey and design stage \nof each CMI scheme. Beneficiary involvement is particularly important in surveying and planning \n(i) the location and height of weirs, (ii) the replacement of two or more traditional weirs by one \npermanent weir, (iii) canal alignment, (iv) the location and size of canal structures, and (v) the \noverall  scheme  layout.  By  providing  inputs  during  the  survey  and  design  work,  project \nbeneficiaries  are  expected  to  increase  their  sense  of  ownership.  Further,  their  extensive \nknowledge of the project area will improve the quality of design works, minimize potential \nresettlement  impacts,  and  ensure  that  the  proposed  CMI  scheme  is  in  line  with  farmers\u2019 \nexpectations.  \n \n4.  Agricultural Extension and Resource Use Planning Component \n \n35.  With  other  ongoing  extension  development  initiatives  in  the  country  (para.  21),  the \nextension assistance will cover both irrigated lowland rice production and upland cropping. \nProduction technologies for cash crops will be included where feasible. Participating villages will \nbe exposed to demonstrations and new production technologies applicable to local conditions in \nthe project villages. Field demonstrations will be carried out based on a participatory needs \nassessment in each participating village to ensure that the service addresses the priority needs \nof  poor  farmers,  in  conjunction  with  the  community  mobilization  component.  Potential \nagricultural  extension  service  packages  will  include  improved  rice-production  technologies, \nlivestock  production  and  management,  crop  diversification,  sloping-land  production \ntechnologies, integrated pest management and weed control, nursery establishment for fruit and \ntimber  trees,  storage  and  postharvest  management  technologies,  and  an  introduction  to \npotential  high-value  cash  crops  where  markets  exist.  The  upland  extension  technology \npackages will be selected based on the communities\u2019 needs and the nature and potential of the \nuplands  peripheral  to  the  irrigable  land.  Catchment  rehabilitation  for  schemes  adjacent  to \nirrigation areas will be included in the upland extension packages as appropriate. \n \n36.  In order to increase the efficiency of land use and to facilitate necessary catchment area \nrehabilitation and management, where applicable in the project area, community-based land \nuse planning will be introduced. Based on better control of water resources with improved \n                                                 \n32  Water demand will be calculated at 4 liters/second/ha of irrigated land. This is high by international standards but is \nnecessary, based on local experience, and is in line with relevant country experience, according to diversion rates \nrecommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. ", "12 \nirrigation facilities, each participating community will eventually develop an annual agricultural \ndevelopment plan to reflect planned cropping patterns, water management, and land allocation. \nThese plans will be developed with the assistance of DAFSO and project staff, to ensure the \noptimal use of resources. Finalized agricultural development plans will be submitted to the \ndistrict authorities for endorsement so that allocation of the land use and water rights indicated \nin the plans will be officially recognized.  \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n37.  Environmental Aspects. The Project is classified as environment category B. The initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) concluded that no serious adverse environmental impact is \nexpected because of (i) the small size of each irrigation scheme, ranging from 50 to 100 ha; \n(ii) the  exclusion  of  existing  and proposed  protected  areas  or  other  designated  forestry  or \nwildlife reserve or sanctuary from the project area; (iii) subproject screening and preparing an \nIEE; and (iv) regular monitoring by PAFSOs/DAFSOs and relevant provincial offices of the \nScience,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA).  Subprojects  will  be  screened  for \ncategorization, and IEEs will be prepared for category B subprojects.  \n \n38.  To ensure adherence with all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, \nregulations and standards, and ADB environmental requirements, during subproject preparation \nand implementation, an environmental management plan for the Project has been prepared, \nand will be implemented by the office of national project director (ONPD) in collaboration with \nthe  PAFSOs/DAFSOs.33  Environmental  measures,  which  need  to  be  implemented  by \ncontractors, will be incorporated in civil works contracts. IEEs for subprojects will be reviewed \nand approved by the STEA. The results of monitoring will be reported to DOI/ Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF),  STEA,  and  ADB  by  semiannual  project  progress  reports, \ntogether with annual reports on environmental monitoring. In addition, IEEs for three sample \nsubprojects were prepared to illustrate the environmental management plan requirements. A \nrepresentative summary initial environmental examination of a sample subproject is provided in \nAppendix 5, and the environmental management plan is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n39.  Resettlement. Feasibility studies on four sample subprojects indicate that resettlement, \nif any, will be small and limited to minor land acquisitions for rural access road improvement and \ncanal  expansion.  The  participatory  designing process  involving  beneficiary  villagers  in  civil \nworks alignments, together with a requirement of minimum resettlement impact included in \nsubproject selection criteria, will minimize any potential resettlement impact. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, a resettlement framework and a sample resettlement \nplan have been prepared.34 At the time of a feasibility study, each subproject scheme will \nprepare  a  resettlement  plan  and  discuss  compensation  entitlements  and  resettlement \nimplementation arrangements with the affected people, in accordance with the resettlement \nframework. Each resettlement plan is subject to approval of ADB, and implementation of the \nresettlement plan and framework will be periodically monitored by project management units \n(PMUs) at the provincial level, and during ADB review missions.  \n \n40.  Clearance of Unexploded Ordnance. Although unexploded ordnance (UXO) is not \nexpected to be a major problem for the Project in general, the Government will clear the \nsubproject sites prior to undertaking any excavation works, particularly those areas designated \nfor the development of new command areas, and areas to be used for new canal and road \n                                                 \n33  An environmental assessment and review procedure indicated in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003) is included in the environmental management plan. \n34  See  Appendix 6  for  Summary  Resettlement  Framework  and  Supplementary  Appendix D  for  Resettlement \nFramework and Sample Resettlement Plan. ", "  13 \nalignments. The UXO LAO is responsible for UXO clearance activities in the country. It has \nmore than 1,100 staff, involves four nongovernment organizations and a Belgian company as \nimplementing partners in the UXO LAO provincial programs, and provides technical and training \nassistance. The budget for UXO LAO is autonomous and is overseen jointly by the Government \nin collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). Relevant district governments and PMUs will be responsible for \nsubmitting requests for land clearance to the UXO LAO. \n \n41.  Ethnic Minority Groups. Of the three major ethnic groups in the project area, the \nKhmou  and  the  Hmoung  are  the  most  vulnerable,  since  most  of  them  do  not  speak  the \nlanguage of the Lowland Lao, the dominant ethnic group, and they tend to be excluded from the \nmainstream social information network. The Khmou is the poorest ethnic group with an average \nlevel of rice sufficiency of 5.9 months per annum, compared with 8.1 months for the Hmong and \n9 months for the Lowland Lao. As all of the ethnic minority groups are more heavily involved in \nupland agriculture than the Lowland Lao, it will be mainly this ethnic group that benefits from \nirrigation development activities.  \n \n42.  To maximize the opportunities for ethnic minority groups to participate in the Project and \nbalance  the  distribution  of  potential  project  benefits,  the  Guideline  for  Ethnic  Minorities \nParticipation Framework has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples.35 The Project includes measures to improve the social integration and livelihood of \nethnic minorities, such as the active involvement of CLOs selected from respective ethnic \ngroups to address communication difficulties. Representation of all ethnic groups in key project \nactivities will be facilitated at the local community level through the CLOs who are familiar with \nthe background of each ethnic group. The development of project extension activities will be \ninitiated through discussions with farmers to identify their priority needs, and selected after \nconsideration of the specific needs of each ethnic group. Given the critical food security status \nof  most  ethnic  minority  groups,  particularly  careful  consideration  will  be  given  to  the \nconsequences of recommending technology options, which do not bring an immediate return on \ninvestment or fail to satisfy household priority consumption needs. \n \n43.  Gender Issues. While women traditionally play a major role in irrigation-related activities \nand all parts of the rice-cropping cycle, women in the project area are disadvantaged relative to \nmen in having a lower level of literacy, and lack opportunities and time to participate on an equal \nbasis as men in meetings, training initiatives, and study tours. In addition, few women farmers \nare appointed to decision-making positions in WUA committees, and only a few women are \nappointed as technical assistants in local government agencies. The number of female-headed \nhouseholds in the project area is limited, and they are not necessarily categorized as vulnerable \ngroups\u2014except young widows with small children, and divorcees. A gender plan has been \ndeveloped to ensure at least 50% representation of women in project activities, with special \nconsideration  for  poor  women  and  women  of  ethnic  minority  groups  (Supplementary \nAppendix B). Supported by DLWUs and CLOs, the Project will encourage a greater role for \nwomen  in  the  decision-making  process  of  WUAs  through  prioritizing  women\u2019s  needs,  and \npromoting the role of women in working together with men in the project activities. The Project \nwill collect and monitor gender-disaggregated indicators. \n \n                                                 \n35  Supplementary Appendix A. The Guideline for Ethnic Minorities Participation Framework was endorsed by the \nGovernment on 16 December 2003. ", "14 \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n44.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  6  years  is  estimated  at  $12.9 million  equivalent, \ninclusive of physical and price contingencies, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $5.1 million \nequivalent or 40% will be incurred in foreign exchange, and $7.8 million equivalent or 60% will \nbe incurred in local currency. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1, and detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 7. \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total Cost \nExchange  Currency \nA.

ADB will provide a loan of $10 million equivalent from its Asian Development Fund \nresources to finance 77% of the total project cost. The Government will contribute $1.9 million \nequivalent in local currency and in-kind costs, and beneficiary farmers will contribute $1.0 million \nequivalent in the form of labor and local materials (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local Currency  Total Cost  % \nExchange \nAsian Development Bank  5.1  4.9  10.0  77 \nGovernment  0.0  1.9  1.9  15 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  1.0  1.0  8 \nTotal  5.1  7.8  12.9  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n46.  The  project  management  organization  has  been  developed,  building  on  the  CMIS \nexperience. The Executing Agency is DOI within MAF, with the PAFSOs in five provinces being \nPMUs. The ONPD located within DOI will have full authority to execute the Project and to liaise \nwith ADB. The ONPD will comprise the national project director, who is a senior DOI staff \nmember,  irrigation  engineers,  extension  specialists,  community  development  officers, \naccountants, and administrative staff. PMUs of participating provinces will be responsible for ", "  15 \nday-to-day  decision  making,  with  activities  at  the  subproject  level  devolved,  to  the  extent \npossible, to the DAFSOs and WUAs. Each of the five PMUs will be managed by a project \nmanager, who is a full-time staff member of the PAFSO of the respective province, and have at \nleast  a  full-time  irrigation  engineer,  a  full-time  agricultural  extension  specialist,  a  full-time \nqualified  accountant,  and  a  full-time  social  and  environmental  impact-monitoring  specialist. \nOverall coordination of the Project will be undertaken by the national project steering committee \n(PSC) to be chaired by the vice minister of MAF; the PSC will meet as required but at least \nevery 6 months.36 In addition, provincial-level steering committees chaired by the vice governor \nwill be established in each of the participating provinces and these committees will meet every 6 \nmonths.37 At the community level, WUGs and other farmer groups will be established at each \nsubproject site during the first year, and at least one man and one woman from each village will \nbe appointed as CLOs, to act as focal points for the implementation of all project activities at the \ncommunity level.38 The lead time required to discuss the project concept with participating \ncommunities,  formulate  village  groups  according  to  their  interests,  implement  the  selected \ncommunity activities, establish WUAs, and plan irrigation rehabilitation will be about 12 months. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 8, and the project implementation organization \nchart is in Appendix 9. \n \n47.  The scheduled period of irrigation development for each subproject is 4 years, with each \nsegment of the process overlapping during the project implementation period. The Project will \nbe  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years,  during  which  three  sets  of  subprojects  will  be \ndeveloped. This staggered construction schedule will allow more efficient use of survey and \ndesign staff, as well as supervisory staff in the Government. Subprojects will be selected in \nphases (10\u201313 subprojects per year) in accordance with the subproject selection criteria. The \ncriteria  have  been  developed  to  ensure  that  the  project  finance  irrigation  schemes  (i) will \nsignificantly contribute to poverty reduction through improving food security, (ii) will efficiently \ndevelop cropping areas, (iii) will be based on strong community initiatives and ownership, and \n(iv) will be socially and environmentally sound (Appendix 2).  \n \n2.  Procurement  \n \n48.  Goods and related services valued at more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding,  and  those  valued  at  $500,000  or  less  through \ninternational  shopping  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Off-the-shelf \nitems  including  vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be \nprocured through direct purchase. Civil works contracts estimated to cost more than $1 million \nwill be procured by international competitive bidding, and contracts costing $1 million or less \nthrough local competitive bidding. An indicative list of procurements is in Appendix 10. To \nexpedite project implementation, ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for advance \naction to cover procurement of goods and services, including vehicles and equipment. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of advance procurement action does not in any \nway commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the Project itself. \n \n                                                 \n36  The PSC will consist of (i) the director, Department of Planning; (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry permanent \nsecretary; (iii) the vice governor of each participating province; (iv) the director, DOI; (v) the head of NAFES; (vi)  \nrepresentatives of the Department of International Economic Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affaires; (vii) a \nrepresentative of the Department of Financial Policy, Ministry of Finance; and (viii) a representative of the Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union. \n37  Provincial-level steering committee members will include  the head of PAFSO, representatives of the Governor\u2019s \noffice, the provincial health and finance offices, and the district office of communication, transport, post, and \nconstruction (CTPC). \n38  In some communities where different ethnic groups reside, representatives of each ethnic group will also be \ndesignated as CLOs. ", "16 \n 49.  Civil works envisaged under the Project will consist of (i) rehabilitation or upgrading of \nirrigation systems, (ii) construction of village access roads, and (iii) renovation of provincial and \ndistrict extension offices. The majority of the civil works for the irrigation systems will be carried \nout  by  the  WUAs  using  their  own  labor  and  local  materials.  Necessary  equipment  and \nconstruction materials such as cement and steel bars will be procured by the Project. Where the \nconstruction techniques required are beyond the capacity of WUAs, the Project, in consultation \nwith the concerned WUA, will award such works through competitive bidding to prequalified \ncontractors using the Government\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to ADB. Materials such as \nculverts  for  village  access  roads  will  be  procured  by  the  district  office  of  communication, \ntransport, post, and construction (CTPC). In instances where construction requirements cannot \nbe met by the villages, district CTPCs will award such works through local competitive bidding to \nprequalified local contractors using the Government\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to ADB. \nCivil works for renovation of provincial and district extension offices will be awarded by PAFSOs \nand DAFSOs using the same procedure. Civil works to be contracted under the Project are \nsmall, and unlikely to be of interest to international bidders. \n \n3.  Consulting Services  \n \n50.  In order to carry out project activities successfully, consulting services for technical \nadvisory and project management are required. A total of 57 person-months for international \nand 230 person-months for domestic consultants will be recruited through an international \nconsulting firm in association with domestic firms, and selected by ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based \nselection method. The terms of reference for consultant assignments are in Appendix 11. The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe Government\u2019s attention is called to ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the section on \nfraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. \n  \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n51.  Under the new rules and regulations established to expedite disbursements, the Ministry \nof Finance will establish an imprest account on behalf of the Project with the Bank of the Lao \nPDR,  and  the  Executing  Agency  will  establish  a  second-generation  imprest  account  with \nrecognized commercial banks acceptable to ADB to be managed by ONPD immediately after \nloan  effectiveness.  At  the  same  time,  five  second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished with recognized commercial banks acceptable to ADB, and operated by each of the \nprovincial-level  project  managers.  The  opening  of  subproject  accounts  is  subject  to  the \nappointment of qualified accountants and the establishment of accounting systems and internal \ncontrol of ONPD that is acceptable to ADB. The project manager within each PAFSO operates a \nsubproject account with a ceiling of $30,000. This ceiling will be increased to $50,000 at project \ncommencement, then to $100,000 at the end of year 1. Each project account will be managed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). The initial combined \ntotal amount in all six accounts will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and no more \nthan  10%  of  the  total  loan.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  imprest  accounts  for  payments  below  the  ceiling  of \n$100,000. In addition to the annual audit requirement, the national project director will conduct \ninspections  of  the  provincial-level  subproject  accounts  from  time  to  time  to  ensure  that \naccounting practices at the province level follow the generally acceptable accounting principles \nwith adequate transparency and good governance. \n \n ", "  17 \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  PMUs will submit quarterly reports to ONPD with an update of the physical and financial \nprogress of project implementation against agreed targets, disbursement of counterpart funds at \nboth the provincial and district levels, and a summary of project progress monitoring results. \nONPD  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  and  a  comprehensive  annual \nprogress report to the relevant government departments and ADB. Within 3 months of project \ncompletion, ONPD will prepare a project completion report in the standard ADB format and \nsubmit it to the Government and ADB. \n \n53.  ONPD and the PMUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  the  finance  resources  received, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. Accounts will be established \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting principles. Consolidated \nproject accounts and related financial statements will be compiled by the ONPD and audited \nannually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit \nreport, and associated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months \nafter the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. In line with ADB policy on submission of \naudited accounts, sanctions are mandatory for statements submitted to ADB more than 6 \nmonths past due date, when imprest funds will not be replenished, and for statements submitted \nto ADB more than 12 months past due date, when loan disbursement will be suspended. \n \n6.  Project Performance Management System  \n \n54.  The project performance management system (PPMS) as it relates to subprojects will be \napplied by the PAFSOs of the participating provinces. Within 9 months of loan effectiveness, \nDOI, with the assistance of the benefit monitoring and evaluation consultant, will establish \nappropriate mechanisms and procedures for PPMS. The major framework for project reporting \nwill be based on a matrix showing subprojects and the status of implementation activities, \nincluding  financial  and  physical  progress  and  completion  of  key  activities.  The  status  of \nsubprojects at the district, provincial, and national levels will be summarized in tables and \ngraphs  to  give  an  overview  of  implementation.  Reports  will  indicate  problem  areas  and \nproposed solutions. The initial social, economic, and environmental surveys carried out at the \ntime of subproject appraisal will provide benchmark data and information for subsequent PPMS \nactivities. The national project director, with the assistance of the consultants, will integrate \nprovincial-level  data  into  the  overall  project  PPMS.  PPMS  findings  will  be  examined  and \nanalyzed by the national project director and reported in quarterly progress reports. The results \nwill be fed back to PAFSOs and DAFSOs in participating provinces and districts, as well as to \nCLOs and WUAs (Supplementary Appendix E has a list of monitoring indicators).  \n \n7.  Project Review \n \n55.  ADB will carry out annual project reviews to assess the progress and impact, and \nresolve issues, if any. In addition, ADB representatives and the Government will carry out a \nmidterm review mission in the third year, based on PPMS findings. The mission will review \n(i) progress of the Project, including planning and design, beneficiary participation, physical \nworks,  quality  of  rehabilitation,  and  possibility  for  modifying  project  scope;  (ii) future \nimplementation  plans  and  targets;  (iii) allocation  of  funds  among  loan  categories; \n(iv) effectiveness  of  the  project  management  structure  and  implementation  arrangements; \n(v) environmental,  social,  economic,  and  technical  aspects  of  the  Project;  (vi) marketing \nconditions and prices for agricultural produce; and (vii) compliance with loan covenants and ", "18 \nreporting requirements. Based on such comprehensive analysis, the midterm review will allow \nfor  necessary  midcourse  corrections  in  the  project  design  to  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation and achievement of the project objective. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n56.  The most important overall impact of the Project will be an increase in food production \nand the potential for raising household incomes of poor households. By upgrading small-scale \nirrigation schemes, the Project is expected to (i) ensure better irrigation water management, \nthereby increasing wet-season paddy yields; (ii) enable crop diversification and double cropping \nin the dry season; (iii) reduce the workload for the regular repair of diversion weirs; (iv) halt the \ncutting down of trees for weir repairs; and (v) expand the irrigation command areas for both the \nwet and dry seasons as a result of better diversion control and improved distribution systems. \nApproximately 30 irrigation schemes will be rehabilitated involving about 1,900 ha of irrigated \ncommand area. A financial analysis has estimated substantial incremental financial income to \nbe generated in the sample subprojects, indicating that induced disposable farmer incomes can \nbe highly positive in the project area. The economic internal rates of return for the subprojects \nhave been calculated at 12\u201319%. The calculated quantifiable cropping benefits demonstrate \nthat substantial economic incentives exist for farmers to diversify crop production, once they \nsatisfy  their  subsistence  needs.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  on  extreme  scenarios  have \nindicated that the results of economic analysis are fairly robust and exposed to marginal risk in \nall but the case of the Nam Pa Subproject in Luang Prabang province (Appendix 12).  \n \nB.  Impacts  \n \n57.   The Project will directly assist those in poor villages in the northern region, who are \nsuffering from food shortages by increasing agricultural production through the provision of \nimproved facilities for wet- and dry-season irrigation, combined with the introduction of improved \nfarming methods and better physical access. In total, around 37,000 rural villagers are expected \nto benefit from the Project,39 of whom at least 60% are poor farmers.40 The estimated 2,700 \nhouseholds in the project area, who already have access to lowlands suitable for irrigation, will \nbe the main project beneficiaries. They are subsistence farmers who face an average of 4 \nmonths of food insufficiency per year, and sometimes practice shifting cultivation in the uplands \nto meet their subsistence needs.41 The Project is expected to reduce food shortages from an \nincrease in irrigated agriculture production, and consequently their swidden agriculture practices \nare expected to be substantially reduced. At the same time, approximately 4,800 households \nthat  do  not  have  access  to  irrigated  land  will  benefit  directly  from  increased  agricultural \nproduction in the uplands, community infrastructure improvements, and watershed management \nactivities, and indirectly from increased agricultural employment opportunities induced by the \nProject. Ethnic minority groups and women in particular are expected to benefit directly from the \nProject due to the proactive measures to encourage their participation facilitated by CLOs and \npriority targeting and monitoring of project activities for them. \n \n                                                 \n39  The total number of participating families is 7,500, and the average size of a family in the project area is 5.2 \npeople. \n40  The majority of families with irrigable lowland and most of the families without access to irrigable lowland are likely \nto be poor. \n41  Approximately 75% of the communities surveyed produced rice to meet their needs for only 8 months each year. ", "  19 \nC.  Risks \n \n58.  The major potential risks to the Project\u2019s impact include (i) inadequate level of human \nresources  and  budgetary  allocation  made  available  for  relevant  PAFSOs  and  DAFSOs  to \nsupport project activities in the field, and (ii) degree of maturity of community organization \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  provide  technical  assistance  and  allow  adequate  time  for \ninstitutional capacity building of both the local government agencies and community-based \norganizations, and encourage an enabling regulatory environment for WUA development and \nproductive  village  activities.  With  regard  to  implementation  capacity  risk  of  the  Executing \nAgency and PMUs, the Project will be implemented in three phases to ease the administrative \nwork burden and to enable delivery of high-quality assistance for the implementation of each \nsubproject.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n59.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  will  provide  the  following \nspecific assurances that will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart  Funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  adequate  provision  and \nprompt  disbursement  of  all  counterpart  funds  for  the  Project  through  timely \nsubmissions of annual budgetary appropriation requests of relevant government \nagencies during each year of project implementation. PAFSO and DAFSO staff \ninvolved in the Project will receive appropriate daily allowances and O&M costs \nfor vehicles in a timely manner, in order to ensure their active and continuous \nparticipation in the Project. \n(ii)  Social Issues. Qualified project staff, including women and persons with ethnic \nminority language skills, will be appointed at the district and provincial levels to \nfacilitate participation of vulnerable groups in the Project. The Government will \nimplement the Guideline for Ethnic Minorities Participation Framework and the \ncommunity  participation  development  plan.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nethnic minority groups, who have irrigable or irrigated lands in the command \nareas of the subprojects, will continue to have secure access to these lands after \nsubproject  completion.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  full  and  timely \nimplementation of the gender plan, including promoting representation of women, \nparticularly ethnic minority women, in WUGs and WUAs, and full participation of \nwomen in extension activities and resulting benefits. \n(iii)  District Lao Women\u2019s Unions. DLWU staff will work under the supervision of \nPMU,  act  in  an  autonomous  manner  without  any  involvement  of  the  Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union at the national level, and all payments for services rendered by \nthe DLWU will be made by the PMU direct to the DLWU.  \n(iv)  Operation  and  Maintenance  Responsibility  of  Water  User  Associations. \nWUAs are responsible for the routine and major maintenance of rehabilitated \nirrigation facilities. However, the Government will bear rehabilitation costs of the \nirrigation schemes damaged by major floods. \n(v)  Land  Use  Rights.  Land  use  planning  under  the  agricultural  extension \ncomponent will be carried out based on participatory discussions with project \nbeneficiaries  and  district  authorities  in  accordance  with  MAF  instruction \nNo. 0822. Once an agricultural development plan is prepared for each subproject \nand endorsed by the district authorities, allocation of the resource use rights \nwithin each village will be officially recognized, and honored as indicated in the ", "20 \nplan. The grace period for land tax payments and the condition for entitlement to \nland use rights will be ensured pursuant to Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 150. \n(vi)  Water Use Rights. DOI will conduct water requirement surveys for all project \nirrigation  schemes  and  report  the  hydrological  data  to  WRCC;  the  water \nallocation for each irrigation scheme will be reflected in the allocation of water \nuse rights that MAF may perform in the future. \n(vii)  Resettlement. ADB will not approve the start of any civil works contracts for any \nsubproject to be financed by the loan unless resettlement plans are satisfactorily \nprepared and disclosed to affected persons by the Government in accordance \nwith the resettlement framework, and approved by ADB. \n(viii)  Environmental Issues. The Government will implement the measures described \nin  the  environmental  management  plan.  At  least  one  full-time  environmental \nspecialist will be assigned within ONPD and each PAFSO or DAFSO.

Irrigation Scheme Development Potential and Investment Requirement  \n \n1.  Overview \n \n1.  In total, 73 potential irrigation schemes in the five participating provinces, including four \nfeasibility study sites, have been studied to analyze technical features and cost implications of \nthe Northern Community Managed Irrigation Sector Project (the Project). The studied schemes \nhave an average catchment area of 66 hectares (ha), where an existing traditional weir provides \nwater for 22 ha of command area on average during the wet season. On the other hand, dry \nseason cropping potential is small in the project area due to limited dry season flow: roughly \n13% of existing irrigated areas is expected to be available for rice and diversified crop cultivation \n(Supplementary Appendix J). \n \n2.  Investment Demand \n \n2.  With their traditional irrigation schemes, farmers in the project area are currently suffering \nfrom (i) frequent damage to the schemes by floods that require labor works and materials for \nrepair several times a year; (ii) low efficiency of existing weirs particularly during the dry season; \nand (iii) low capacity of existing weirs in expanding command areas. Over the last 20 years, the \nexperience  of  major  funding  agencies  in  the  sector  demonstrated  that  the  replacement  of \ntraditional weirs by permanent structures could effectively improve efficiency of water use and \nreduce substantially the labor requirement for repairs. In general, this assistance for small-scale \ncommunity-managed irrigation schemes has been successful because they simply improve a \ntraditional system, already well known to farmers, as opposed to trying to introduce entirely new \nconcepts  such  as  pumping  irrigation.  Upgrading  small-scale  schemes  without  changing  the \ntraditional gravity-fed design has also allowed most of poor farming communities to operate the \nupgraded schemes in a sustainable manner, because of its relatively economical expenditure \nrequirements  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).1 Any  schemes  that  require  high  cash \nexpenditures for O&M cannot be sustainable where the scope for cash crop development is limited \ndue to rice deficiency, small dry-season flow, and limited access to local markets. \n \n3.  The total investment required for the civil works of the 73 schemes in the long list, including \nsurvey, design, and supervision, is estimated to be about $10.3 million.2 Given the size of the \nfinancing resources, the Project is expected to finance about 30 subprojects. In order to facilitate \nactive  community  participation  throughout  the  project  implantation  period  and  to  ensure \nsustainability and community ownership in the process, the Project needs to invest in community \ninstitution-building efforts and extension assistance to complement the impacts of the irrigation \ninvestment as well. \n \n3.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n4.  The approach is to select schemes in poorer areas among technically feasible irrigation \nscheme development options in the northern provinces in order to maximize impacts on poverty \n                                                 \n1 Gravity-fed schemes require routine labor works for weir and gates, and both intake and sluice gates need to be \nreplaced every 7 years. On the other hand, pumping schemes require diesel or electricity for their operation and \npumps need to be replaced every 8 years. Estimated annual O&M costs for Nam Pa scheme in Luang Prabang, for \ninstance, is $25 per ha for a gravity-fed scheme (KKU-Lao weir), and $155 per ha for a diesel pump scheme, which \nis way above what farmers can afford. \n2 The survey, design, and supervision costs are estimated to be about 15% of civil works, and required local material \nand labor cost is about 10% of civil works. ", "Appendix 2  25 \n \nreduction. In support of integrated water resource management approach, locations that would \noverstretch the water flow available in each river basin will be avoided, and the schemes with \ncommunities  that  understand  the  concept  of  irrigation  management  transfer  (IMT)  and \ndemonstrate community ownership will be selected to ensure sustainability of irrigation facilities \nand their tangible development impacts. Specific selection criteria include: (i) over half of the \ntotal village population in each subproject are poor, which can be measured by the national \npoverty line and/or household rice insufficiency of more than one month; (ii) the command area \nper  subproject  of  10\u2013100  ha;  (iii) the  construction  cost  per  hectare,  including  all  imported \nmaterial, local material, and labor costs up to $2,500; (iv) the economic internal rate of return for \neach subproject of 12% or higher; (v) the availability of water of suitable quality (a continuous \nflow of 4 liters/second per ha of irrigated area), and minimal negative impact on the environment \nor the downstream water users; (vi) no existing or proposed protected areas or other designated \nforestry or wildlife reserve/sanctuary included in the geographical coverage of any subproject; \nand  (vii) understanding  and  agreement  of  all  the  beneficiaries  about  their  expected \nresponsibilities during the construction, O&M of irrigation schemes, and their contribution in the \namount agreed as an appropriate irrigation service fee.3  A subproject selection flowchart is in \nFigure A2.1. \n \nB.  Policy and Regulatory Framework \n \n5.  The  national  irrigation sector  development  strategy  in  the  Lao  People's  Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR) has been refined based on the national agriculture sector strategy, which \nwas developed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance, to focus on irrigation \nmanagement  transfer,  community  managed  irrigation,  water  resource  planning,  integrated \nassistance  with  extension,  and  irrigation  technology.  Specifically,  the  Government  aims  to \n(i) intensify  and  expand  dry  season  irrigation  in  the  flatlands  as  a  major  input  to  boost \nagricultural productivity and create market-driven farming system, and (ii) expand and intensity \nsmall-scale  community-managed  irrigation  systems  in  order  to  assist  rural  households  to \nachieve food security and diversify their farming systems in the sloping lands. \n \n6.  Irrigation  Management  Transfer. Transfer of ownership and O&M responsibility of \nirrigation schemes by supporting establishment and strengthening of water user associations \n(WUAs)  is  central  to  the  Government\u2019s  irrigation  subsector  development  strategy.  Prime \nMinisterial  Order  No. 26  (PMO 26)  issued  in  December  1998  directed  that  all  publicly \nmaintained irrigation systems be transferred to local communities, which would be responsible \nfor (i) O&M and (ii) repayment of a part of capital investment costs required for irrigation system \nimprovement. PMO 26 laid the foundations for the Decentralized Irrigation Development and \nManagement  Project  (DIDM),  which  supported  institutional  and  regulatory  environment \nimprovement required for implementation of the IMT policy. The regulation necessitates WUA \nmembers to begin making payments into a local village development fund (VDF) from the day \nthe ownership of irrigation systems is transferred from the Government to local WUAs. This \nrequirement applies to all farmers throughout the country who own land served by irrigation \nfacilities,  unless  the  irrigation  facilities  were  developed  by  private  funds.  The  intent  of \nestablishing  a  VDF  was  to  allow  government  funding  directed  at  a  small  number  of \ncommunities, to be redistributed across wider communities, and to finance O&M costs of the \nirrigation schemes. \n \n7.  Cost Recovery. Under the IMT policy, a portion of capital investment costs required for \nirrigation scheme development is to be recovered through collection of an irrigation service fee \n(ISF) from WUA members of government-funded irrigation schemes. However, an estimation of \n                                                 \n3 Where applicable, least-cost analysis of optional schemes will be undertaken to minimize the capital investment \ncosts. Subproject proposals with higher unit cost than the ceiling cost will be submitted to ADB for approval.

Thus, in order to achieve the effective \ntransfer and sustainable use of irrigation schemes, WUAs associated with small-scale irrigation \nschemes should focus on the fee collection from WUA members to fully finance the cost of \nfuture  maintenance.  In  support  of  such  an  initiative,  the  Government  issued  a  ministerial \nguideline No. 0672 in August 2003 in order to indicate that the payment responsibility of WUAs \nwith small-scale irrigation schemes is limited to collection of ISF to finance solely the future \nO&M costs of their schemes. At the same time, the guideline made a provision to allow each \nWUA to decide its ISF level based on its future maintenance requirement, as O&M requirements \nvary significantly depending on the design and scale of irrigation schemes.4 \n \n8.  Land Tenure. Unclear allocation of land use rights of sloping lands is a major constraint to \npermanent and sustainable cultivation of sloping-land and catchment area protection activities in \nrural  villages.  This  prevents  communities  from  optimizing  the  use  of  available  production \nresources. Upland areas surrounding the lowlands and community land suited to sustainable \nagricultural use is often not used effectively, mainly due to a lack of mechanisms to allocate \nuser rights for such land, thereby discouraging its productive use by farmers. The Land Law of \nJune 1997 specifies that the national community owns land, and individuals have the right to use \nland,  provided  they  use  it  continuously  and  effectively.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is \nresponsible for land management including land registration, land titling, and leasing. Although \nMOF has started issuing land ownership titles supported by the land titling project of the World \nBank, the project assistance focuses only on titling of irrigable lowlands and it will take many years \nbefore land titling becomes available in the remote mountainous villages. With regard to land use \nrights, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is authorized to issue land certificates to \nlegally indicate user rights for those who have used land continuously for a period of 3 years for \nagricultural production. The allocation of such land use rights is the responsibility of district \nadministrations. These land certificates are initially issued to families for a period of 3 years, and \nsubsequently the families will retain the rights to the use of the lands provided they continue to \nfarm the lands.5 As land use certificates are not issued for sloping lands, farmers do not have any \nincentive  to  establish  permanent  and  sustainable  cropping  systems  on  sloping  lands. \nConsequently, sloping land suitable for sustainable and long-term crop production such as tree \ncrop production and forage cultivation is often left uncultivated. In the potential project area, the \nuser rights of almost all the irrigable land have already been allocated to individuals, and there will \nbe no scope for redistributing newly irrigated land. In order to materialize the effective and \nsustainable use of productive land in the project area, the Government ensured that (i) the land \nuse planning will be carried out for both lowlands and sloping lands adjutant to irrigation schemes, \nin a participatory and equitable manner with full participation of villagers as stipulated in MAF \ninstruction No. 0822 issued in August 1996, and (ii) the grace period for land tax collection will be \nexercised in accordance with Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 150. \n \n9.  Water Use Rights. Although the Water Law was adopted in October 1996 and Prime \nMinister\u2019s Decree No. 204 was issued in October 2001 (PM. 204) to guide law enforcement, \nmechanisms for enforcement have not been developed at present. While informal arrangements \nfor the water use exist, officially recognized water rights, as such, are not yet in place. Although \nconflicts between competing uses of water are rarely seen because of the country\u2019s good fortune \n                                                 \n4  The maintenance for small-scale and gravity-fed irrigation schemes requires labor contribution and limited fee \ncollection in form of cash to purchase imported materials for periodic maintenance. While the current ISF for \ngravity-fed schemes is set at 150 kg/ha/year, future maintenance costs required for small-scale schemes range \nfrom 135 to 175 kg/ha/year. The estimated costs include cash expenditures for routine maintenance and periodic \nmaintenance in 15th year required for weir and canal rehabilitation. \n5   If the family ceases to practice farming, the relevant district authority may reallocate the land to others. ", "28  Appendix 2 \nin  having  abundant  water  resources,  conflicts  in  water  allocation  could  arise  in  the  future, \nparticularly during the dry season, as upgraded irrigation facilities increase. Thus, an integrated \nwater resource management approach to the future irrigation development is critical. To this end, \nthe Department of Irrigation (DOI) will survey water requirements of each subproject for both the \nwet and dry seasons, plan future irrigation development for each river basin in line with relevant \nriver  basin  development  plan  in  close  coordination  with  the  Water  Resource  Coordination \nCommittee (WRCC) and local authorities, periodically report the data to the WRCC and the \nrespective offices of the provincial and district governor as evidence of historical water use, and \neventually obtain a water use license for each irrigation scheme in accordance with PM. 204.  \n \nC.  Integrated Approach to Agricultural Development \n \n10.  Integration  of  extension  services  with  irrigation  development  will  more  effectively \nimprove  development  impacts,  and  is  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s  agricultural  development \nstrategy. Given the better control over water resources with upgraded irrigation facilities, the \nProject  also  needs  to  support  participating  communities  in  planning  their  land  and  water \nresource use to optimize the utilization of available resources. Extension assistance in the \nnorthern provinces needs to be formulated in participatory and flexible modalities as farming \nconditions significantly vary from village to village. Extension packages will be developed and \ndelivered through good coordination between relevant community-level organizers (CLOs) and \ndistrict agriculture and forestry service office (DAFSO) and province agriculture and forestry \nservice office (PAFSO) staff to ensure that the packages address the pressing livelihood needs \nof project beneficiaries. Active participation of CLOs is a key to development of demand-driven \nand effective extension systems in rural areas. \n \n11.  Delivery  of  such  extension  services  and  land  use  planning  will  be  carried  out  in \npartnership  with  qualified  institutions  with  adequate  relevant  experience  so  as  to  enhance \noutreach to farmers in the project area. The Lao PDR has several institutions with good practical \nknowledge  in  specialized  areas,  such  as  the  National  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Research \nInstitute (NAFRI) and the Lao International Rice Research Institute (Lao IRRI) for rice varieties \nsuitable for irrigated and upland cultivation, seed multiplication, drying and pest-free storage \ntechniques;  the  Agriculture  Development  Center  that  has  knowledge  provided  by  Thailand \nextension  experts  and  training  facilities  for  tree  and  vegetable  cropping,  livestock,  and \naquaculture; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that has local \nknowledge of kitchen gardening, cash crops, food production, and nutrition management, and \ngender  mainstreaming  training  in  agriculture;  the  Integrated  Upland  Agriculture  Resource \nProject implemented by International Rice Research Institute, International Center for Research \non Agro-Forestry, International Center for Tropical Agriculture, and Commonwealth Scientific \nand Industrial Research Organization has upland production-enhancing technology packages; \nand  the  Lao  Extension  for  Agriculture  Project  that  has  been  training  master  trainers  for \nextension services on various technical areas. To the extent possible, the Project will use \nexisting and high-quality extension and training materials and services available from these \nexisting agricultural research institutions and training centers. \n \nD.  Least-Cost Design and Alignment Selection \n \n12.  Active participation of beneficiaries will be sought during the survey and design stage of \neach community-managed irrigation scheme. A social analysis during the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance revealed that farmers have a good knowledge of the water availability, the \ngeneral topography of the land, and the irrigation requirements. By providing inputs during the \npreparation stage, the project beneficiaries will increase their sense of ownership, and their \nextensive knowledge of the project area will improve the design work and ensure the proposed ", "Appendix 2  29 \n \nCMI scheme is in line with farmers\u2019 expectations. Similarly, alignment finalization will be carried \nout by DAFSO and PAFSO staff through village walks with the project beneficiaries so that the \nmost economical and socially sensible alignment will be selected. The scope of contractors\u2019 \nwork will be decided in consultation with the participating communities with regard to material \nand labor availability, technical challenges, and time required for works, and contractors will be \nused  only  when  work  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  communities  as  determined  by  the \ncommunities.  \n \n13.  Based on village discussions, DAFSO and PAFSO engineers will explore technically \npossible designs, estimate the initial investment requirement and cost implication for O&M for \neach potential design, and select the least-cost design with participating communities to ensure \nefficiency and financial sustainability of irrigation schemes. As a sample case, a least-cost \nanalysis has been carried out for Nam Pa scheme, which will supply water to 60 ha of command \narea during the wet season. The analysis findings indicate that the gravity-fed scheme (KKU-\nLao  weir)  is  the  most  economical  investment  option,  and  the  most  financially  sustainable \nbecause of the affordable level of annual O&M costs and the ISF requirement (Table A2.1).  \n \nTable A2.1: Design Options for Nam Pa Scheme (scheme life of 30 years) \n \nDesign  KKU-Lao Weir  Gabion Weir  Diesel Pump \nMain Canal  6 km  6 km  4 km \nCommand Area  65 ha  65 ha  65 ha \nInitial Investment Cost (1)  $279,625  $247,034  $162,918 \nTotal maintenance cost (2)  $49,460  $116,490  $85,320 \nPump operation cost (3)      $216,480 \nTotal (1) + (2) + (3)  $329,085  $363,524  $464,718 \n(Cumulative over 30 yrs) \nAnnual Regular O&M  $320  $416  Pump operation: $7,216 \nMaintenance: $ 400 \nMajor Maintenance  Weir: $5,130 (year 15)  Gabion wire: $17,451  Pump units: $24,400 \nGates: $7,400 (every 7  (Every 5 yrs)  (Every 8 yrs) \nyrs) \nAverage annual O&M cost  $1,649  $3,883  $10,060 \nAnnual O&M cost per ha  $25  $60  $155 \nRequired ISF collection/  $26.44  $60.10  $164.09 \nha/year in cash (rice)  (286 kg)  (649 kg)  (1,772 kg) \nha = hectare; ISF = irrigation service fee; kg = kilogram; O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Capacity of Participating Communities \n \n14.  Many farming communities in the project area have a long history of operating and \nmaintaining traditional small-scale irrigation systems. Strong community support and ownership \nin  the  proposed  project  activities  have  been  confirmed  during  community  consultations \nthroughout  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  implementation  and  the  project \nprocessing. The technical aspects of operating and maintaining rehabilitated irrigation schemes \nare expected to be well within the capacities of those villages as long as farmers develop clear \nunderstanding on the design and the operating method of upgraded irrigation systems through \ntheir  involvement  in  the  design  and  construction  works,  and  training  on  O&M  and  water \nmanagement. \n \nF.  Introduction of Water Resource Management \n \n15.  Water Management within Communities. In traditional irrigation schemes the water \nflowing into main canals and into fields are generally uncontrolled, with a supposition that \u201cthe more \nwater, the better the effect\u201d. New permanent weirs will allow better control over diverted water flow \ninto the main canal, enabling communities to plan and manage optimal water allocation. In order to ", "30  Appendix 2 \nenhance irrigation efficiency, increase yields of wet season crops, and better prevent damages \ncaused by normal floods, better water use management practices need to be introduced to \ncommunities. By operating lift-gates and water control structures of main canals (check, drop, \ndivision box, farm turnout, etc.), communities can adjust and divert only the required flow. Although \nthe Community Managed Irrigation Sector Project (CMIS) trained WUA members on the principles \nof  water  management  systems  operation,  some  project  communities  can  share  their  water \nresources  more  effectively  among  upper  irrigation  blocks  and  tail-end  irrigation  blocks  by \norganizing water rotation systems through controlling inlet gates. Many WUA members still also \nneed to be reminded of proper water flow control during floods to prevent canal and other structure \ndamages. \n \n16.  In order to optimize water use in the communities, WUAs need to develop systematic \nmanagement functions to (i) record water flow periodically, (ii) plan water allocation and cropping \npattern based on water flow estimates, and (iii) control system of water flow. These activities need \ntechnical supports from relevant PAFSO and DAFSO staff, and will be carried out in conjunction \nwith the development of the agricultural development plan for each subproject area.  \n \n17.  Where relevant and feasible, a WUA and a rural water supply group can also jointly take a \nholistic approach to community water management, and plan and monitor an optimal allocation of \nwater use within the community. This arrangement will also facilitate all villagers\u2019 participation \nincluding representation of the poorest groups, and provide a social facility to discuss water-related \nissues within a community.  \n \n18.  River-based Integrated Water Management Approach. Of the long-listed 73 potential \nsubproject sites, 22 subprojects are to share the same water source either with other long-listed \nsubproject or with other existing projects. At present, water conflict among irrigation schemes is \nnot  an  issue,  largely  because  traditional  wooden  weirs  themselves  have  played  a  proper \nregulating role to avoid social conflicts in the dry season due to the limited capacity of and \nnatural leakages from weirs. For modern irrigation scheme, however, a control measure for the \nwater diversion needs to be included in the subproject selection criteria to avoid negative \nimpacts on downstream users. 6  \n \nG.  Good Governance \n \n19.  Management of WUAs and farmer production groups need to be accountable to their \nmembers, and transparency in their decision making process must be ensured in order to keep \nsound  incentives  for  farmers  to  continue  their  participation.  Eventually,  WUAs  and  farmer \ngroups  should  elect  their  leaders  and  management.  WUA  needs  to  have  adequate \naccountability  and  transparency  in  managing  the  collected  fund  to  sustain  both  optimal \noperations of irrigation facilities and farmers\u2019 good incentive to pay the fee. A good bookkeeping \npractice is required to record the fee collection from WUA members and cash expenditures to \npurchase imported materials required for maintenance works. Group discussions to decide the \nuse of expenditures, periodical election of village leaders and WUA committee members are \nalso required in order to provide farmers with opportunities to evaluate the performance of their \nelected leaders. \n \n                                                 \n6  The subproject selection criteria will restrict the diversion of the dry season stream flow at a weir at no more than \n50%. Considering the fact that 50% or less of the flow is diverted, and that a portion of this diverted flow returns to \nthe stream, the impact on the downstream users should be minimal, if any.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national priority    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \nin country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR):  \n \nThe Government\u2019s goals are to reduce poverty by 50% by 2005, to eradicate it by 2010, and to enable the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) to graduate from being a least developing country to a developing country by 2020. The \nCountry Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Lao PDR and the poverty reduction \npartnership agreement signed by the Government and ADB in 2001 state that efforts will be directed toward reducing \npoverty by broadening community participation and opportunities during the next 5 years. The operational priorities to \nachieve these goals are (i) rural development and market linkages, (ii) human resource development, (iii) sustainable \nenvironmental management, and (iv) regional integration. The Project aims to contribute to these operational priorities by \n(i) improving  food  production  by  developing  cost-effective  and  sustainable  farmer  managed  irrigation  schemes, \n(ii) enhancing human development by providing the enabling environment for more effective community participation in \nrural development activities, (iii) environmentally appropriate extension activities in the uplands promoting sustainable \nenvironmental management of local resources, and (iv) promotion of regional integration via support for a more farmer-\ncentered agricultural extension service. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   Core Poverty Intervention \n \nOf an estimated population of 5.5 million in the Lao PDR, about 30% live below the poverty \nline. This is defined as being where a person cannot access the equivalent of 2,100 calories \nin foodstuffs or the equivalent of KN142,500 per month or less than US$0.50 per day. The \nLao PDR defines this as the food poverty line. The Lao PDR also differentiates between \naverage poverty lines for urban and rural areas and between different regions. The per \ncapita per month poverty line is upward of 30% higher in Vientiane than in the rural areas of \nthe Lao PDR. The poorest province in the project area is the northern province of Huaphanh \n(74.6%),  followed  by  Xaysomboun  Special  Region  (55%),  Luang  Prabang  (49.4%), \nXiengkhuang (34.9%) and Xayabury (21.2%) living below the poverty line. For the project \narea as a whole an estimated 45% of the population lives in poverty. If the urban population \nis excluded in these provinces over half the rural population is living in poverty. The project \narea also contains some of the severest forms of poverty (ultra-poor) in the Lao PDR. \nHuaphanh has the most severe form of poverty (11.3% of people) followed by Xaysomboun \nSpecial Region (7.1%) and Luang Prabang (4.7%). The regional percentage at 6.8% is the \nhighest in the Lao PDR (4%) . \n \nFor the selected districts in the project area the incidence of poverty ranges from 88% in   \nSobbao (Huaphanh) to 13.6% in Thong Mixay (Xayabury). However, in the latter district \nthere are villages where the incidence of poverty is quite high (44%). Additionally in the \nother district of Xayabury\u2014despite the relatively low incidence of poverty on a provincial \nbasis (in part due to its close proximity to Thailand)\u2014there are several villages that would \nlikely be included in this Project with a high incidence of poverty (over 60%). Typically all \ndistricts in the project area have some villages where the incidence of poverty is quite low \nand other villages where it is quite high. Villages or those households in villages that have \naccess to allocated land or land that could be allocated for irrigation are somewhat better \noff than villages or those households within the same villages that do not have access to \nlowland suitable for irrigation. The subprojects would likely include such villages or a \ncombination of villages. \n    \nRice-deficit months have been used as one of the key quantitative indexes to assess the \nextent of poverty in the project area. Of the different ethnic groups where over 80% of \nhouseholds are classified as poor it is more likely that the lowland Lao and Hmong \nexperience some form of rice shortage. However, in all other villages where over 20% of \nhouseholds are living in poverty these villages are likely to be where the Khmou are found \nin the majority. The Khmou nationally have an average rice sufficiency of 5.9 months ", "Appendix 4        33            \ncompared to the Hmong of 8.1 months and the lowland Lao of 9 months. In the project area \nthe variation will occur on a village-by-village basis dependent on what access to land \nsuitable for irrigation that the different ethnic groups have access to. Household food \ninsecurity needs to be measured not simply by lack of rice but days on which households or \nspecific members of households (e.g., mothers going without food to feed young children) \nstate they actually experience hunger. There may or may not be food deficits on an \noccasional basis but there is nowhere in the project area where people will go without food. \nHouseholds will make up for the shortfall in agricultural production\u2014irrespective of their \nethnic background\u2014by using forest resources for subsistence and income generation. \nBamboo shoots, frogs, fish, and red-ant eggs are all examples of edible foodstuffs that are \ngathered from the forest to make up this deficit.   \n \nPeople have a conception of household food security that goes beyond simply having   \nsufficient food to feed household members. It also includes access to safe drinking water, \nsecure access to land forest and water resources, security for their livestock, the capacity to \nsend their children to school every day or on most days, and to provide a buffer against life \ncrises. It also importantly includes adequate material and symbolic resources to fully \nparticipate in the religious and ritual activities in local communities and meet other kinship \nobligations such as providing support for close kindred experiencing material hardship. \nWhere exclusion occurs as a result of not being in a position to fully participate in local \ncommunity life a form of social exclusion, which is one of the key qualitative indicators of \npoverty, often occurs. For ethnic minorities unable to speak the national language of the \nLao PDR this is also a form of social exclusion that exacerbates poverty. Upward of only \n40% of Khmou are literate (male 60.8%, female 2.7%) and 26.5% of Hmong (male 45.7%, \nfemale 8.1%) compared to the Lao PDR rate of 72.9% (male 84.4%, female 65.1%). \n \nThe Project adopts a pro-poor approach and the components have been designed to \nbenefit people living in poverty. To ensure that the poor are among the beneficiaries, each \nsubproject will provide a range of agricultural extension packages based on the priorities of \nthe poor within each of the subproject communities, most of whom are likely to be involved \nin upland agricultures. Community-level organizers (CLO: female and male including where \nrelevant from ethnic minority backgrounds) will be appointed for the duration of subproject \nimplementation to facilitate the targeting of women and ethnic minority groups. People \nliving in poverty will be afforded the opportunity to actively participate in water user \nassociations (WUAs), especially in subproject areas where rural water supply interventions \nare supported by the Project. This is likely to reduce the social distance between better-off \nhouseholds and households living in poverty. The Project will also provide an enabling \nenvironment for district agriculture and forestry service office (DAFSO) and district Lao \nWomen's  Union  (DLWU)  to  work  more  closely  with  poor  households  on  designing \nappropriate extension packages that will directly benefit the poor. Sharpening of the poverty \nfocus  will  also enable  provincial agriculture and forestry service office (PAFSO) and \nDAFSO to more effectively target households living in poverty in order to meet the overall \npoverty reduction strategy of the Lao PDR. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance to identify stakeholders as well \nas their roles, interests, preferences, and aspirations. The primary stakeholders are (i) households in the subproject \nareas that will benefit directly or indirectly from project interventions; (ii) village development committees and other \norganizations (formal and informal) which will be both recipients and major role players in the community mobilization, \nconstruction  of  community-managed  irrigation  schemes,  and  agricultural  extension  and  resource  use  planning \ncomponents;  (iii) PAFSO  extension  workers  who  will  collaborate  with  WUAs  and  farmer  production  groups;  and \n(v) members of mass organizations, especially the district and village Lao Women\u2019s Union. The stakeholders\u2019 meetings \ndemonstrated much interest in and support for the Project from village leaders, local communities (including most \nimportantly women and ethnic minority groups), and members of the Lao Women\u2019s Union. A socioeconomic survey \nconducted during the technical assistance captured important social and gender profiles of the project area. A series of \nparticipatory rural appraisals were facilitated to determine the needs and priorities of the primary stakeholders. Other \ninputs from stakeholders have also been incorporated into the project design. \n \nSecondary project stakeholders include PAFSO who will play a key role in monitoring and evaluation of all aspects of \nproject implementation. Where necessary, PAFSO will provide technical backstopping to DAFSO. PAFSO in all five ", "34  Appendix 4 \nprovinces has expressed strong support for the Project being prepared to apply lessons learned from the Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Project (CMIS). National Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES) has also \nexpressed strong support for the Project and will either supply or contract master trainers to provide training in subject \nareas (such as sloping agricultural land technologies) where little or no expertise exists at either the district or provincial \nlevel. Strong support has also been expressed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and its specialized \nagencies including the Department of Irrigation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nDuring the feasibility study stage, and from the lessons of CMIS, it was realized that substantial time and effort are \nrequired to adopt a fully participatory process in the design and development of not just the irrigation schemes but the \nextension-related activities in both upland and lowland areas of the subproject area. Without systemic community \nmobilization  via  water  user  groups  that  involve  the  equal  membership  of  both  women  and  men,  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) responsibilities and ownership of irrigation schemes will be nonsustainable. Equally, agricultural \nextension and land use planning-based activities that are not designed in accordance with the full and active participation \nof primary stakeholders are unlikely to be very successful. The participation strategy is also premised on synergies being \nachieved between DAFSO extension workers, including female extension workers, and local farmer production groups \nthat are more appropriate in the context of upland farming systems in the project area than has hitherto been possible. \nHowever, the participation strategy also demands of stakeholder groups, especially PAFSO, a better understanding of \nsocial and gender issues than exists at present. Iterative monitoring and evaluation of the participation strategy will \nrequire systematic attention to both quantitative indexes of participation (such as the frequency of attendance at meetings \nby vulnerable groups) and qualitative indexes of participation (such as to what extent vulnerable groups were able to \nraise relevant issues and have them accepted by other group members). \n \nA project-specific community participation development plan has been prepared. Essentially it starts from the premise \nthat unless local communities are prepared to take ownership for project interventions, including participation of women \nand men stakeholders (and ethnic minorities) then support will not be given to that community. However, once a \ncommunity agrees with the objectives of the subproject\u2014to be supported by a series of appropriate information sessions \nexplaining these objectives\u2014the Project will provide the enabling environment via the appointment of both a female and \nmale CLO (and where appropriate an ethnic minority CLO will also be appointed). The principal tasks of these CLOs will \nbe to work with their own local communities and be the linkage with the village committees, DAFSO, and DLWU. They \nwill receive appropriate training in social mobilization, including mobilization strategies for women and ethnic minorities, \nand will be expected to provide appropriate training to beneficiaries at the village level. Their performance will be \nmonitored by both their own local community and an external monitoring agency, which is likely to be the DLWU. \nCommunity mobilization will be considered successful if during subproject implementation as many opportunities as \npossible are afforded to local communities to play an active role in actual implementation. If local communities are able to \ncontribute to the survey and design of irrigation schemes, provide the appropriate inputs such as labor contributions for \nland  clearing,  contribute  to  the  development  and  maintenance  of  WUA,  and  demonstrate  ownership  by  taking \nresponsibility for O&M, then the participatory component of the subproject will be considered successful. The same \ncaveats apply to the agricultural extension and land use planning component. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen\u2019s interests can be at risk if they (i) miss out on technical and organizational innovations that come with the \nProject; (ii) miss out on the benefits of the Project; and (iii) are left out of the decision-making processes, which affects \ntheir lives, including labor and livelihood issues. The Project will entail efforts to ensure that women and men benefit \nequally from the Project, and that the Project\u2019s participatory processes are used as an experiential learning model from \nwhich lessons can be learned for the gender and development processes in the Lao PDR. The Project\u2019s gender strategy \naims to (i) mitigate the risk that women will be disadvantaged by project interventions (e.g., design of irrigation schemes \nor irrigation packages are gender sensitive); (ii) ensure women\u2019s participation in community dialogue and partnering \nactivities (e.g., meetings and farmer exchanges on an equal basis with men); (iii) ensure equal representation of women \n(at least 50% representation) in WUG; (iv) promote men working  with women in the Project (e.g., on-farm crop \nproductivity improvement trials); (v) prioritize women\u2019s needs (e.g., DAFSO extension officers providing training in fields \nrequested by women such as animal health interventions); and (vi) facilitate gender training and integration programs \nwith the assistance of the DLWU (e.g., gender and development programs targeted at both men and women at the village \nlevel and PAFSO/DAFSO). \n \nThere are significant differences in women\u2019s social and economic status between the different ethnic groups. Unlike the \nHmong and Khmou, Lowland Lao society has a matrifocal bias, in which daughters generally inherit household assets, \nincluding land. This should mean that Lowland Lao women can make decisions about how land is going to be utilized or \nhow water is going to be managed. However, generally speaking women at the village level are not equal partners in ", "Appendix 4        35            \nmost public activities even if in public they have considerable influence over men. The situation is even more problematic \nfor other ethnic groups in the project area. However, the Project has the potential to have positive social and economic \nimpacts on women by (i) reducing rice deficits and thereby contribute to household food security; (ii) adding value to \nexisting upland agricultural activities via appropriate but market oriented technology options; (iii) providing women with \nthe opportunity to decide what knowledge they would like to acquire through training; and (iv) providing the enabling \nenvironment for women to more actively and effectively participate in the public decision-making processes at the \ncommunity level. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Of these groups the    No \n  Khmou (who are Mon-Khmer) are the indigenous peoples of the \n None  area and also generally the most disadvantaged. The Lowland \nLao  are  most  numerous  in  Houaphanh  (61.5%)  and  least \nnumerous in Luang Prabang (28.6%) and over 40% in the other \nprovinces. The Khmou constitute 45.9% of the population in \nLuang  Prabang  but  only  10.2%  of  the  population  in  Xieng \nKhoung.  The  Hmong  constitute  53.7%  of  the  population  in ", "36  Appendix 4 \nXaysomboun Special Region but only 15.2% in Luang Prabang. \nHowever, Lowland Lao are disproportionately represented in the \ndistricts of the project area because they live in lowland areas \nand have been allocated or have been promised allocation of \nland that is suitable for irrigation.  \n \nAs part of the community-based strategy of the Project, special \nmeasures will be adopted to ensure that ethnic minorities will \nbenefit  equally  from  project  interventions.  CLOs  from  ethnic \nminority backgrounds (including women) will be appointed to \nsubproject areas where ethnic minorities are to be found. For the \nentry  point  extension  packages  poorer  groups  and  women \namong the ethnic minority groups will be accorded top priority. \nDAFSO will be required to work closely with ethnic minorities to \nbetter  understand  upland  farming  systems  and  then  provide \nappropriate  training  if  requested  by  these  ethnic  minorities. \nDAFSO will also need to improve its staffing profile by recruiting \nadditional staff from ethnic minority backgrounds or training its \nown  staff  in  how  to  be  more  farmer-centered  with  such \ncommunities. Appropriate language training will be provided to \nethnic minorities who cannot speak Lao, including if necessary \nduring the day when they are working in the uplands rather than \nin a classroom. Ethnic minority groups will also be afforded the \nopportunity  to  become  active  participants  in  water  user \nassociations that also manage rural water supply systems. \n \nMany people from non-Lao ethnic backgrounds will benefit from \naspects of the community mobilization component (especially \nrural drinking water supply and rural access roads) and will \ndefinitively benefit from the agricultural extension and resource \nuse  planning  component  that  is  focused  on  upland  farming \nsystems. In some of the subproject areas\u2014Houaphanh being the \nobvious example\u2014some ethnic minority groups will benefit from \nthe community-managed irrigation scheme because they are \neligible to have some of the unallocated land allocated to them. \nThe Project requires of DAFSO (also PAFSO and NAFES) that it \nadopt a more open-minded approach to the benefits upland \nfarmers bring to agriculture in the Lao PDR rather than focusing \non the more negative aspects of shifting cultivation. This has the \npotential to empower ethnic minority groups in ways they have \nnot been empowered in the past. Specifically targeting ethnic \nminority  groups  should  also  increase  the  income  of  these \ngroups, even if more indirectly via an increase in food security. \nThere  will  also  be  greater  opportunities  afforded  for  ethnic \nminority  groups  to  be  socially  included  rather  than  socially \nexcluded from other ethnic groups through language training and \nthe opportunity to participate in community-based organizations \nrather than clan or kin based groups. This has the potential to \nempower  women  from  these  backgrounds,  especially  if  it  is \nassociated with language training because it effectively means \nthey  do  not  need  to  communicate  with  other  ethnic  groups \nthrough their spouses or village leaders.  \n    No  other  vulnerabilities  are  expected  among  project   \nOther Risks   Significant  beneficiaries.

The Houay Lor Irrigation scheme (the Subproject) is one of the four core subprojects \nselected for feasibility level study as a basis for the preparation of the Lao Northern Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Loan (the Project) proposed for financing by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). The subproject site is located in the Nam Bak district, approximately 8 kilometers \n(km) east of Nam Bak, Luang Prabang province. An environmental management plan (EMP) \nhas been prepared for the Project as a whole, and describes the environmental assessment and \nreview framework that will be applied to all subprojects (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n2.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Subproject was undertaken during \nthe project preparation work. It entailed a review of possible design options and proposed \nproject area and its environs, field observations within and around the proposed scheme, and \ninterviews with a variety of groups. At the time of the IEE, a proposed final design had yet to be \ndetermined but this, in fact, turned out to be a positive factor since it allowed the results of the \nIEE  to  be  taken  into  consideration  in  reviewing  and  formulating  design  and  development \noptions. The Project as a whole and its major environmental and social impacts have been \nwidely discussed between July 2002 and July 2003 during 36 focused village group discussions, \nand the socioeconomic surveys that involved 113 villages in the northern provinces. Further \nbeneficiary consultations will be carried out for the detailed survey and design of subprojects in \norder to minimize any social and environmental adverse impacts and to design schemes that \nmeet beneficiaries' needs and expectations. \n \nB.   Description of the Project \n \n3.  The Subproject seeks to develop the small-scale community-managed irrigation scheme \nwith the objective to improve the livelihood of poor farming communities through sustainable \nirrigation  development.  The  Subproject  is  in  line  with  government  agriculture  development \npolicies that focus, amongst others, on stable food production, mitigation of shifting cultivation, \nand  on  curbing  and  reversing  watershed  degradation.  It  is  recognized  that  small-scale, \ncommunity-managed irrigation agriculture is to play a key role in attaining these objectives.  \n \n4.  The  Houay  Lor  scheme  is  an  existing  farmers\u2019  managed  irrigation  scheme  with  a \ncommand area of 50 hectares (ha). The proposed subproject will entail the replacement of three \nexisting small wood and rock diversion weirs by three permanent run-of-the-river weirs. The \nweirs will be small in size. Left and right main canals will be constructed with a total length of \n6.0 km, of which 4 km existing canals and 2 km new canals. This would allow a wet-season \nextension of the irrigated area by 30 ha, from 50 to 80 ha. The dry-season irrigation potential will \nstay the same at 14 ha. The canals will be hand-dug, although some rock sections may require \nheavy equipment. The canals will be unlined, and provided with passageways at selected \nplaces. Canal heads, canal banks passing through unstable soil, as well as stream banks just \nbelow the weir will be reinforced with concrete and rip-rap to prevent scouring. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n5.  Annual rainfall in Luang Prabang province during \u201cnormal\u201d years is in the range of \n1,350\u20131,400 millimeters per year (mm/y). The Houay Lor is a small permanent stream with an \nestimated rainy season flow of 1\u20132 cubic meters per second (m\u00b3/s), and an estimated dry-", "38  Appendix 5   \nseason flow peak of 100 liters per second (l/s). The watershed area of the Houay Lor lies about \n3 km to the north (Pha Kioulom, 1,386 m mean sea level (MSL) and is approximately 26 square \nkilometers (km\u00b2), half of which covered with secondary forest, the remainder used for upland \ncropping. The Houay Lor drains into the Nam Bak, a tributary of the Nam Ou which joins the \nMekong river some 40 km to the southwest. In general the water quality in the river is good, with \nhigh level of oxygen and low level of nutrient concentration. This is a favorable condition for \nirrigation development.  \n \n6.  The Houay Lor scheme lies within the zone formerly covered with dry evergreen forest \nbut very little of this formation survives in a natural state. By far the most common forest type in \nthe Luang Prabang province is the upper mixed deciduous forest that still covers parts of hilltops \nnearby the Houay Lor scheme. To date there are 46 provincial protected areas (PPAs) in Luang \nPrabang province, of which seven totaling 2,580 ha have been established in Nam Bak district. \nIn addition, Luang Prabang province has established 47 provincial protection forests (PPFs), of \nwhich seven totaling 1,822 ha are located within the Nam Bak district. None of these protected \nareas and protection forests is located in or near the proposed Houay Lor scheme area.  \n \n7.  The Houay Lor scheme in the Nam Bak district serves 229 families (1,056 persons) of \nthe ancient Nakhone village that was established several centuries ago. A second village, Vieng \nKham, was more recently established (1986), now providing living space to 104 families (557 \npersons). Of the families in Nakhone village, 51 families are involved in upland agriculture, 57 in \nlowland agriculture, and 181 families maintain a home garden. After implementation of the \nHouay Lor scheme, the number of beneficiaries of irrigation upgrading will be 75 families (363 \npersons), which is 23% of the population of the two villages. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  After implementation of the Subproject, two environmental benefits are expected to \nemerge: (i) reduced amount of trees cut for weir repairs, and (ii) enhanced watershed protection \nthrough poverty reduction and effective use of water resources. Nonetheless, a number of \npotential environmental adverse impacts may occur during the preconstruction, construction, \nand postconstruction periods. Using the checklist and matrix of environmental parameters and \nproposed  mitigation  measures  for  irrigation  sector  projects  from  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines, the Subproject was screened for potential environmental impacts. The results are  \ndiscussed below. \n \n1.  Environmental Impacts Due to Project Location and Design \n \n9.  The Houay Lor is a small permanent river from which water will be diverted for irrigation. \nDrainage water and excess rainwater from the command area will return to the Houay Lor at the \ntail end of the command area. In the wet season, only a very small percentage of the river flow \nis diverted. In the dry season, a maximum of 50% of the river flow is diverted, and a part of this \nreturns to the river downstream. This is only a slight increase from present diversion by wood & \nrock weirs.  \n \n10.  As noted above, although there are seven PPAs and seven PPFs in Nam Bak district, \nnone of these PPAs and PPFs are located in or near the proposed Houay Lor scheme area. \nMoreover, Houay Lor water is virtually no silt load and is slightly alkaline as a result of runoff \nfrom limestone rock slopes. However, the water is still suitable for irrigation purposes. \n \n \n \n   ", "Appendix 5  39 \n2.  Environmental Impacts Associated with the Construction Phase \n \n11.  Some  temporary  adverse  environmental  effects  could  occur  during  the  construction \nphase  without  proper  management.  These  would  include  soil  erosion,  improper  siting  of \nworkers\u2019 quarters and poor waste disposal, loss of land, and aesthetic deterioration in borrow \nareas. None of these impacts are expected to be individually particularly serious.  \n \n(i)  Soil  Erosion.  Since  no  major  earth-moving  works  are  required  under  the \nSubproject,  no  erosion  risk  during  the  construction  phase  is  expected. \nNevertheless,  contracts  with  construction  companies  will  include  clauses \npertaining  to  earthworks,  engineering  practice,  and  adequate  evacuation  of \ndrainage water. \n \n(ii)  Siting of Workers\u2019 Quarters and Waste Control. Some outside workers will be \nused  for  construction  activities.  However,  since  the  subproject  works  will  be \nrelatively small scale, a large number of outside workers are not expected.  \n \n(iii)  Borrow Areas. The amounts to be used would be small. Nonetheless there \ncould still be concerns that land owners or users may not be adequately and \nproperly compensated. \n \n3.  Environmental Impacts Resulting from Project Operations \n \n12.  It  is  expected  that  only  one  potential  problem  has  been  identified  for  the  project \noperation phase, which is the question of downstream water quality for human consumption due \nto the increased use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer. Irrigation development is expected to \nresult in an increase of farmers' incomes, and consequently, in increased use of pesticides and \nchemical fertilizer. \n \n13.  Currently, use of pesticides in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is still \nrelatively low, although in recent years the share of farmers using pesticides has increased from \n25% to 56%. There are two factors that warrant vigilance on future use of these compounds: \n(i) the Lao PDR is bordered by three pesticide-exporting countries\u2014People\u2019s Republic of China, \nThailand, and Viet Nam\u2014and manufacturing companies have their own promotion programs; \nand (ii) farmers in the Lao PDR have insufficient knowledge of safe handling and application of \npesticides, which may lead to misuse. However, such problems could be mitigated through \nstrengthened management mechanism as well as implementing water quality monitoring. To \nmitigate this potential impact farmers will be trained on (i) the selection, safe use, and handling \nof pesticides, (ii) integrated pest management (IPM), and (iii) personal health care using as a \nreference the updated Regulation on Conservation and Use of Pesticides in Lao PDR (2000), \nwhich lists prohibited or restricted use of chemical compounds.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Monitoring Program \n \n14.  Two agencies are responsible for environmental management and monitoring in Luang \nPrabang province and will need to be associated with this subproject. The first is the provincial \noffice of science, technology and environment agency (STEA) and the second is the provincial \ndepartment of agriculture, forestry service office (PAFSO). In collaboration with the provincial \noffice of STEA, PAFSO will need to play a leading role in monitoring construction activities to \nensure that they conform to the mitigation requirements listed in the matrix. For this purpose, \ntraining and follow-up guidance will be provided under the Project, elaborating the proposed \nEMP for the Project.   ", "40  Appendix 5   \n \n15.  To implement the above-mentioned monitoring program, three water quality parameters \n(total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and alkalinity) will be tested once per year by \nthe laboratory of Department of Irrigation/Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at the end of the \nrainy season. The result would indicate possible changes in physical and chemical properties as \na result of increased sedimentation, fertilizer residues entering the river downstream of the \ncommand areas through drainage water; sediment load could also indicate changes in the \nwatershed, or the effects of bank scouring.  \n \n16.  It is estimated that total cost of $3,000 will be needed, of which $1,000 will be used to \nthe proposed water quality monitoring and the remaining will be used for training in safe use of \npesticides, IPM, and personal health care. Environmental monitoring results should be recorded \nand be submitted to PAFSO on a semiannual basis.  \n  \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n17.  The Houay Lor scheme will, after rehabilitation, allow for wet-season irrigated cropping \non 80 ha. It will be based on the diversion of small volumes of water from the Houay Lor. It will \nbe  a  gravity  irrigation  scheme  that  returns  excess  rainwater  and  drainage  water  from  the \ncommand area back into the Houay Lor. After rehabilitation, the volume of diverted water in the \nwet season will amount to only a very small percentage of the river flow. In the dry season, a \nmaximum of 50% of the river flow is diverted, and a part of this returns to the river downstream. \nAccordingly, in particular with regard to the above screening process and analysis of potential \nenvironmental impacts, it is concluded that the proposed subproject is unlikely to result in any \ndirect significant adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n18.  The  identified  adverse  impacts  were  readily  addressed  through  proper  engineering \ndesign and incorporation of the identified mitigation measures. Adverse impacts relate almost \nentirely to the construction phase, and particular attention will be paid to ensure that contractors \ncomply  with  good  engineering  practice  and  avoid  inconvenience  to  the  public  during \nconstruction.  Nonetheless,  in  order  to  ensure  correct  design  and  environmentally  sound \nconstruction and operation, a detailed EMP will be prepared and carried out during the design \nperiod.  \n \n19.  With regard to excessive fertilizer and pesticide use, given the fact that (i) only a small \narea of dry-season irrigated agriculture is expected, and (ii) the farmers within the project area \nwill be provided with supervision and training in dry-season cropping, including guidance in IPM, \nthe potential adverse impacts will be greatly minimized. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n \n20.  The Houay Lor scheme is a traditional farmer-managed irrigation scheme with a water \ndistribution system based on gravity, and return flow of drainage water in the same stream \n(Houay Lor) from which water is being diverted for irrigation. Some positive environmental \neffects can  be  expected  as  a  result  of  the subproject; while,  with proper  supervision  and \nmonitoring during the construction phase, adverse environmental impacts are expected to be \nminor and temporary. Accordingly, the subproject could result, not only in raising incomes, but \nalso in enhanced quality of life of residents in and around the subproject area, and improved \nwatershed protection and sustainability of the scheme. Since no serious adverse environmental \neffects are likely, a full environmental impact assessment is not considered necessary.  \n   ", "  Appendix 6   41 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  Project Background. The Northern Community-Managed Irrigation Project (the Project) \nwill operate in the mountainous areas of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and will have four \ncomponents:  (i)  community  mobilization,  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building,  (iii)  community-\nmanaged irrigation investment, and (iv) agricultural extension and resource use planning. Of the \nfour components, the community-managed irrigation investment component will cover about 30 \nsubproject sites and will most likely have land acquisition and/or resettlement effects as the \nproposed outputs include: (i) replacement of traditional weirs with new weirs; (ii) construction or \nmajor repairs to primary canals; (iii) construction of large or difficult structures within the system; \n(iv) advice on distribution and drainage arrangements; and (v) upgrading of about 30 kilometers \nof rural access roads. \n \n2.  The proposed irrigation schemes to be developed or improved by the Project will be \nsmall with areas less than 100 hectares (ha) and an estimated average area of 50 to 60 ha. \nIrrigation water supplied from all schemes will be gravity fed from small diversion weirs.  \n3.  Objective. A resettlement framework for this Project has been prepared to ensure that \nresettlement screening, planning, and management procedures are established and will be \napplied  to  all  subprojects  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n4.  Preparation  of  Resettlement  Plans.  This  Project  will  ensure  that  during  project \nimplementation, resettlement will be avoided or minimized as much as possible. During project \nimplementation, the following steps will be followed: \n(i)  Screen subprojects with possible land acquisition and resettlement. The screening \ncriteria need to consider not only the scale (number of affected persons\u2014APs) but \nalso the degree (severe or marginal); \n(ii)  Identify the need for the preparation of a full or short resettlement plan (RP)1 in \naccordance with the criteria set out in the ADB Handbook for Resettlement; and \n(iii)  Relevant provincial agriculture and forestry service offices (PAFSOs) will prepare each \nsubproject RP when required to be submitted to ADB for approval and to be disclosed \nto APs before the award of civil works contracts. \n5.  Legal Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements. This resettlement framework \nhas been built upon the laws of the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the \nADB Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the draft National Resettlement Policy.2 \nThe principles and objectives are to ensure that all APs will be compensated for their losses at \nreplacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures to assist them to improve, or at \nleast maintain, their preproject living standards and income-earning capacity. The cut-off date of \n                                                 \n1   A full RP is for significant resettlement effects, i.e., 200 people or more will experience major impacts, which \ninvolves affected people being physically displaced from housing and/or more than 10% of the household\u2019s \nproductive assets (income generating) are lost. A short RP is for not insignificant resettlement effects, which \ninvolve displacement of fewer than 200 people, and loss of less than 10% of their productive assets (income \ngenerating). \n2   A draft National Resettlement Policy was prepared by the Lao PDR Government in 1995 and presented by the \nScience,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  to  the  ADB  RETA  5935  Regional  Workshop  on  National \nResettlement Policy Enhancement and Capacity Building at ADB Headquarters in 2002. The draft policy is the \nbasis for a Ministerial Decree on Resettlement that is being prepared under the Environment and Social Program, \nLoan 1867-LAO, approved on 6 December 2001. \n   ", "42  Appendix 6 \neligibility for entitlement is the date that the census is carried out. The local communities will be \ninformed prior to the start of the said activities. Persons identified during the official census, \nwhether with or without legal title or rights to the land, are eligible for compensation. Persons \nwho encroached the area after the agreed cut-off date will not be entitled to compensation or \nany other form of resettlement assistance (Table A6).  \n \nTable A6: Project Compensation Principles and Entitlements \n \nType of Losses  Entitlements \nTemporarily Affected  \u2022 No compensation for land if returned to original user. However, the Project will \nLand  pay rent to APs during the temporary use of APs\u2019 land; \n  \u2022 Cash  compensation  for  loss  of  crops  and  trees  at  market  prices  and \ncompensation for loss of net income from subsequent crops that cannot be \nplanted for the duration of the lease. \nPermanently  \u2022 Compensation for affected land, crops, and trees at market value. Lack of \nAffected Land,  formal legal rights to the assets lost will not prevent APs from compensation \nCrops, and Trees  and rehabilitation measures. \n  \u2022 For  land  under  tenancy  or  sharecropping  arrangements,  the  amount  of \ncompensation for crops and trees will be divided between the landowner and \nthe tenant/sharecropper/lessee according to the sharecropping arrangements.  \nAffected Houses,  \u2022 Cash compensation equivalent to replacement cost for materials, labor and \nPrivate or Business  other transaction costs without deduction for depreciation and/or salvageable \nStructures  materials.  APs  will  be  provided  with  transport  and  transition  subsistence \nallowance and loss of income if applicable. \n\u2022 Tenants renting houses/structures are entitled to 3 months\u2019 rent at prevailing \nmarket rates in the area. Tenants will also be assisted to identify alternative \naccommodation  and  provided  with  transport  and  transition  subsistence \nallowance and loss of income if applicable. \n\u2022 For socially and economically vulnerable groups, the Project will assist in \nfinding employment, including project work, replacement land and assist in \nrebuilding their homes if traditional sources of community or family support are \ninsufficient; provide additional necessary assistance in cash or in kind (e.g., \nfood, labor) based on their identified needs and priorities; and provide suitably \nadvantageous site to vulnerable households whose livelihoods will be affected \n(e.g., small shops) in order to reestablish their businesses. \nAffected Community  \u2022 Cash  compensation  for  restoration  of  affected  community  buildings  and \nProperty Resources  structures, infrastructure to original or better condition. \n\u2022 Cash compensation at replacement cost or income restoration measures for \nincome loss, if any (e.g., irrigation, community forest, income from fishing in the \nsubcatchment watershed and fishponds).  \nSource: The Resettlement Framework. \n \n6.  Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress. The selection of subprojects will \ndepend primarily on consultation and community participation. For subprojects that may involve \nland  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  effects,  the  APs  and  communities  will  be  informed, \nconsulted properly, and encouraged to participate in order to provide proper information and \nallow proper planning. APs and communities will include those who have customary rights to \nnatural resources in the project subcatchment areas but will not be the project beneficiaries. \nSubproject RPs will be prepared and disclosed prior to ADB approval. For grievance redress, \nthe Project will provide APs with opportunities to express their concerns or grievances orally or ", "  Appendix 6   43 \nin writing. All attempts will be made by the Project to address such grievances pertaining to the \nProject as a whole, relating to land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement issues. All \ncomplaints or grievances will be documented properly and time-bound action plans will be \nagreed upon between the Project and APs. The Project will properly monitor the progress of \nsuch grievances and ensure that all grievances are resolved on a timely manner. \n \n7.  Implementation Arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) through \nthe office of national project director (ONPD) will be responsible for the overall RP activities of \nthe concerned PAFSO and provide technical assistance if necessary. PAFSOs and district \nagriculture  and  forestry  service  offices  (DAFSOs)  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation. PAFSO, headed by a provincial project manager, will designate full-time chief \nresettlement officer from PAFSO and resettlement officer/s from DAFSO to ensure the proper \nRP  preparation  and  implementation  of  RP  activities.  PAFSO  will  work  closely  with  APs, \nconcerned departments, NGOs, and supervision consultants. The project consultants will have \na community development specialist to assist and supervise all social and resettlement-related \nactivities.  \n \n8.  Project Schedule. The community-managed irrigation component will be implemented \nfrom the second year of project implementation. The selection of about 30 subprojects will be \ncarried  out  in  phases  where  10  to  13  subprojects  will  be  implemented  each  year  after \nundertaking the consultation and community participation process, completion of detailed design \nand detailed measurement survey, and community discussions to finalize alignments.

", "Appendix 12  55 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The goal of the Northern Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project (the Project) is to \nreduce rural poverty through increased agricultural production and income earning opportunities \nin the project area. The major means to attain these goals include the development of small-\nscale  community-managed  irrigation  schemes  and  the  provision  of  agricultural  extension \nservices  to  both  irrigated  farms  and  to  upland  cultivators  in  the  target  communities. \nApproximately 30 subprojects covering roughly 1,900 irrigated hectares (ha) in 11 districts \nlocated  in  Luang  Prabang,  Sayaboury,  Xieng  Khouang,  and  Houaphan  provinces  and \nXaisomboun Special Zone will be selected for the project financing according to the subproject \nselection criteria. \n \nB.  Methodology \n \n2.  For  the  quantified  analysis,  benefits  and  costs  are  examined  based  on  \u201cwith\u201d  and \n\u201cwithout\u201d scenarios for 20-year life of the Project. With the provision of extension services as \nwell  as  increased  and  more  reliable  irrigation  water  \u201cwith\u201d  the  Project,  it  is  expected  that \nimproved farmers\u2019 choices of crops and technologies will enable a more productive agriculture \nin the subproject areas. Quantifiable direct benefits of the Project are comprised largely of \nincremental production of irrigated rice and higher-valued dry-season vegetable crops as well as \nimproved  maize  in  the  upland  areas  surrounding  each  community.  Some  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) cost saving is also expected as the project weirs will replace wood and \nstone weirs, for which O&M costs (in timber and labor) are very high. As available timber \nbecomes progressively distant, it is assumed that these O&M costs would increase 2% per \nyear. \n \n1.  Price Assumptions \n \n3.  Financial prices used in the analysis were identified through a survey of the subproject \nareas and crosschecked with prices noted in a variety of secondary sources. Economic prices of \ntraded goods, such as rice, maize, and fertilizers, have been estimated at boarder parity based \non  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections.  The  investment  and  recurrent  costs  were \nsegregated into tradable, nontraded, and labor components, and converted into economic price \nusing financial process net of taxes, duties, and subsidies. The economic analysis is presented \nin 2002 constant terms, and economic cost and benefits are estimated using the world price \nnumeraire. A prevailing exchange rate of KN10,800 per US dollar has been used for the \nanalysis. For nontraded goods and services, economic prices have been calculated based on \nlocal financial prices adjusted by a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 and a shadow wage \nrate (SWR) factor of 0.8 are used for rural labor in the farm budgets in order to reflect average \nlevels of rural underemployment in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. \n \n2.  Farm Model Assumptions \n \n4.  The average yield of irrigated rice cultivation during the wet season is assumed to \nincrease from 2 tons per hectare to 3 tons per hectare, and during the dry-season double \ncropping of different combinations of corn and vegetables will be introduced gradually over the \n6 years of extension assistance.1 To allow time for adoption of improved agricultural techniques \n                                                 \n1  The type of vegetables to be produced during the dry season will vary depending on the demand of accessible \nmarkets. For the analysis, representative crops of cucumber, cabbage, and onion are utilized. ", "56  Appendix 12 \nand the clearing of uncultivated land required for irrigation expansion, incremental production \nbenefits  will  be  gradually  realized  over  a  6-year  period  after  the  completion  of  irrigation \nrehabilitation works. As each subproject community presently cultivates a significant amount of \nupland area surrounding irrigated flat lands, the upland area for maize cultivation in each \nsubproject is assumed to be 200 ha. It is assumed that project extension services for upland \nagriculture will induce a gradual adoption of improved crop varieties up to 75% over 6 years. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n1.  Financial Viability of Representative Farms \n \n5.  Incremental net crop income has been calculated by examining the yields and inputs of \nrelevant crops in the subproject areas under \u201cwithout\u201d and \u201cwith\u201d project conditions. Annual \ncropped area (as a proportion of \u201cwith\u201d project-benefited area) is expected to increase by 74\u2013\n112%. Incremental production (in metric tons), on-farm employment (in days), and net crop \nrevenue (in both financial and economic terms) as a result of project investments have been \ncalculated using  farmgate  prices. Expected  generation  of  incremental  financial  income  per \nhectare in the four subprojects is highly positive, indicating that substantial disposable incomes \nof farmers can be induced in the project area (Table A12.1).  \n \n6.  The expected level of incremental financial revenue per hectare is more than adequate \nto cover the irrigation service fee (ISF). The ISF levels were estimated based on the future cash \nexpenditures required for (i) annual routine maintenance, and (ii) periodic maintenance in year \n15, which is expected to be 5% of the full construction cost. The annual routine maintenance \ncost of an irrigation system has been calculated at $10 (or 135 kilograms (kg) of paddy as a \ncash equivalent) per ha for weir maintenance plus labor contribution equivalent of 3% of the \ncanal construction cost. It should be noted that the estimated ISF required to finance cash \nexpenditures for annual routine maintenance and the full costs of periodic maintenance is quite \naffordable for farmers: the ISF accounts for 9\u201320 % of estimated incremental financial revenues \nfor households. Thus, irrigation beneficiaries should find it worth their while to protect their \nbenefits by performing (or paying for) the required future O&M costs. \n \nTable A12.1: Financial Viability of Representative Farms \n \nSubproject    Nam Ten    Nam Pa    Houay Lor    Houay Yang Noi \n  With  Without  With  Without  With  Without  With  Without \nProject  Project  Project  Project  Project  Project  Project  Project \nIrrigated area (ha)     113  31  90  12  80  40  26  16 \nFinancial crop     218  27      345  29       190  35  95  35 \nincome ($/ha) \nRequired annual  29    85    23    50   \nroutine \nmaintenance \n(days/ha) \nRequired annual  17    27    17    12   \nISF for routine and \nperiodic main-\ntenance ($/ha) \nISF/Incremental         9             9    11    20   \nincome (%) \nha = hectare; ISF = irrigation service fee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "Appendix 12  57 \n2.  Fiscal Implications \n \n7.  Incremental  operating  costs  for  the  Government  to  support  community  institutional \nbuilding, extension service development, and irrigation scheme rehabilitation under the Project \nwould  have  relatively  minor  budgetary  implications.  The  average  counterpart  funding \nrequirement during project implementation would be less than 0.8% of the Government\u2019s annual \nbudget for the agriculture sector. During the postproject period, the aggregate incremental \noperating costs of fieldworks required to fulfill the Government\u2019s commitment to sustain the use \nof irrigation facilities through community consultations, irrigation facility maintenance assistance, \nand agricultural extension activities account for about 1% of the existing budget of the Ministry \nof Agriculture and Forestry.2 \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n \n8.  Economic viability of the four subprojects (Nam Ten, Nam Pa, Houay Lor, and Houay \nYang Noi) was examined comparing the estimated benefits under the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d \nproject situations. Crop production budgets have been derived for each of the four subprojects \nbased on the expected improvements in cropping patterns and crop yields. Only the incremental \nagricultural employment portion is calculated as accrued employment benefits. The incremental \nvalue of production has been combined with an evaluation of investment and O&M costs to \ndevelop a cash flow over the subproject life, and economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and \nnet present values have been calculated (Table A12.2). The EIRRs range from 12% for Nam Pa \nto 19% for Houay Yang Noi. The majority of the cropping benefits in value terms arise from \nincreased irrigated area, and the improvement of dry-season cultivation and upland agriculture, \nwhich implies that substantial economic incentives exist for farmers to diversify crop production \nin the project area, once they satisfy their subsistence requirements.  \n \n1.  Sample Economic Analysis \n \n9.  Quantified  Benefits.  An  analysis  of  the  Nam  Ten  scheme  in  Phoun  district, \nXaisomboun Special Zone is presented as a sample analysis.3 The population of 1,754 (316 \nhouseholds)  has  land  in  the  subproject  area  (combining  irrigated  and  upland  areas).  This \nscheme currently irrigates 31 ha through the use of seven traditional stone and wooden weirs \nlocated along the Nam Ten. No dry-season cropping is possible with these structures. The \nProject will replace these weirs with a more permanent concrete structure upstream of the old \nweirs. Additional land will be cleared and prepared for cultivation, bringing the total irrigated \narea to 112.7 ha. Some dry-season irrigated cultivation of vegetables will be possible. Nam Ten \nis fairly well connected by road to Vientiane (140 km away), and marketing of vegetables is \nexpected to take place through traders\u2019 visits to the village, periodic roadside markets, and \ndistrict rural markets. The subproject is expected to increase rice production by 344 tons, maize \nby 210 tons, and to produce 355 tons of representative vegetables (onion, cucumber, and \ncabbage). Annual incremental farm labor on the irrigated area (plus the assumed 200 ha of \nupland maize land) is expected to be 22,886 days. For the average 0.99 ha farm incremental \nannual  paddy  production  per  household  has  been  calculated  to  be  1,088  kg,  when  the \nsubproject  is  fully  operational.  The  consequent  increase  in  annual  household  income  is \nestimated at about $251 on average. \n \n                                                 \n2  The incremental operating costs during the postproject period include staff fieldwork expenses, O&M costs of \nequipment, and office expenses of DAFSOs, PAFSOs, district Lao Women\u2019s Unions, district communication, \ntransport, post and construction offices, and district health offices. \n3  Full models and analysis for all four subprojects are presented in Supplementary Appendix H. ", "58  Appendix 12 \n10.  Nonquantified Benefits. Apart from crop benefits, various other project benefits that are \nhighly relevant to rural livelihood are expected to arise, including (i) improved status of nutrition \nand  welfare  of  the  population,  (ii)  secondary  employment  and  business  opportunities  in \nagricultural  production,  (iii)  better  access  to  water  from  newly  developed  domestic  water \nfacilities, and (iv) improved access to markets and educational and health facilities. Some other \nnonquantified  benefits  are  quite  important  from  social  and  environmental  development \nperspectives  as  well.  Community  mobilization  programs  will  help  the  local  populace  both \norganize its efforts for both project and nonproject activities and include both women and \ndisadvantaged ethnic minorities in its decision making. The development of increased irrigated \nland  is  likely  to  decrease  village  dependence  on  upland  swidden  agriculture,  producing \nenvironmental benefits in forest preservation and decreased soil erosion. \n \n11.  Economic Return. The Nam Ten subproject appears to be economically viable: the \nEIRR is estimated to be 15% (net present value = $73,090, discounted at 12%), which was \nderived based on the incremental economic net crop revenue of $88,117 per year and the \nirrigation infrastructure\u2019s construction cost of $1,940 per ha. The total economic investment \ncosts were $253,467. Subproject-specific community mobilization and extension costs include a \nper ha share of the community level organizer training, farmer training, extension demonstration \nmaterials, rural access road development, domestic water supply system development, and the \nfield operation costs of provincial agriculture and forestry service office, district agriculture and \nforestry service office, and district Lao Women\u2019s Union  staff.4 All costs including extension have \nbeen assumed conservatively for the EIRR calculation to occur in years 1\u20134, while actual \nproject implementation is likely to stretch extension services to as long as 6 years.  \n  \n12.  Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the \nderived  economic  return.  The  tested  scenarios  are  less  benefited  area,  less  dry-season \ncultivated  area,  dropped  crop  prices,  decreased  crop  yields,  lower  benefit  level,  higher \nconstruction and O&M costs, and shorter product life. Overall, the subproject appears to be \nquite robust. It will take fairly significant changes in the risk variables to cause the EIRR to drop \nbelow the 12% cost of capital and the sensitivity of each of the risks is low. This assessment of \nrobustness is supported by an estimate that there is only a 13.5% probability of the EIRR falling \nbelow the 12% level.5  \n \n13.  Poverty Impact Analysis. The estimated distribution of project benefits reflects the \ncurrent distribution of assets within the subproject community, as agricultural production benefits \nare likely to accrue almost entirely to the owners of the land. Based on the result of the social \nanalysis, it has been estimated that 215 poor households (68%) reside in the subproject area. \nAs the poor households cultivate 131 ha or 43% of the project area, they are expected to get a \nsimilar  proportion  of  incremental  net  crop  income.  The  poor  can  also  benefit  from  the \nincremental agricultural wage-labor opportunities, which will cover a part (50% is assumed here) \nof  the  increased  labor  needs  of  the  nonpoor  farms  in  the  subproject  area.  Overall,  when \ncombining crop production and labor income, the poor can attain approximately 50% of the full \nlocal financial benefits of the subproject. The average annual incremental increase in household \nincome among the poor is expected to be $184, and the average incremental increase in rice \nproduction on farms of the poor to be 537kg. The poverty impact ratio for the subproject is 0.85.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Only costs that are specific to the development of the subprojects are included. \n5  This estimate was made using the @Risk program in which ranges were set for each independent risk variable \n(benefited area, dry season area, crop prices, crop yields, and construction cost) and 1,000 iterations were \ngenerated.
