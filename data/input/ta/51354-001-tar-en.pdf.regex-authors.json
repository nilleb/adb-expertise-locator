INTRODUCTION \n1.  Stunting and other forms of malnutrition persist in Indonesia and can have significant \nnegative impacts on the cognitive and non-cognitive development outcomes of children and \nadolescents.1 The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Government \nof Indonesia\u2019s development of nutrition-enhancing programs and policies targeting adolescents, \nby (i) assessing the current nutritional status of adolescents to identify and prioritize nutritional \nchallenges; (ii) addressing the burden of malnutrition from a life cycle perspective by implementing \npreconception  nutrition  care,  school-based  nutrition  interventions,  and  nutrition  support  to \ndisadvantaged  adolescents;  and  (iii)  deriving  rigorous,  policy-relevant  evidence  on  the \ndevelopment impacts of such interventions in terms of health and education outcomes through \nrandomized controlled trials. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy \nfor Indonesia, 2016\u20132019 and the government\u2019s National Long-term Development Plan (2005\u2013\n2025), which emphasize enhanced human resource development through better health and \nsmarter education and skills development.2 High-quality evidence on the impact of nutrition \nintervention on development produced by the TA will assist evidence-based policy making in the \nhealth and education sectors.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Double burden of malnutrition among Indonesian youth. Young people in Indonesia \nare increasingly experiencing a double burden of malnutrition (DBM)\u2014the coexistence of under- \nand over-nutrition in the same population and individuals. The youth population, aged 10 to 24 \nyears old, numbers 65 million (28%) of the Indonesian population, including 48 million adolescents \naged 10 to 19 years. They form the foundation of the country\u2019s long-term economic development, \nbut a DBM may hamper their development potential.  \n \n4.  Dietary risks and malnutrition. Dietary risks and malnutrition have been identified as \ntwo of the top five risk factors in Indonesia driving death and disability combined.4 Women and \nchildren have a higher risk of all forms of malnutrition. Among Indonesian women, 14% have \nchronic energy deficiency as measured by mid-upper arm circumference.5 Among children under \n5 years of age, stunting affects 9.5 million children (36%), and wasting 3 million children (14%).6 \nMicronutrients are critical for the development of immune system and cognitive functions. Despite \npolicies  of  universal  iron,  iodine,  and more recently  vitamin  A  fortification  of  staple foods, \nmicronutrient deficiencies remain common in Indonesia. Stunted children are more likely to \nbecome obese later in life if they do not adopt a healthy, active lifestyle. Overweight and obesity \n                                                \n1  The World Health Organization defines children as young people under 19 years of age. Adolescents are defined as \nyoung people between 10 to 19 years old.  \n2  ADB.  Indonesia:  Country  Partnership  Strategy  2016\u20132019.  https://www.adb.org/documents/indonesia-country-\npartnership-strategy-2016-2019; Government of Indonesia. 2004. Undang-Undang Tentang Rencana Pembangunan \nJangka Panjang Nasional Tahun  2005\u20132025 (National Long-Term Development Plan) (Law No. 17/2007). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 June 2018. \n4  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Indonesia Country Profile. (accessed 6 Oct  2017). \n5  Riskesdas (Basic Health Research) 2007 data. The World Health Organization defines a 10%\u201319% prevalence of a \nmid-upper arm circumference of less than 23.5 centimeters as a medium prevalence of maternal undernutrition, \nindicating a poor nutrition situation.  \n6  International Food Policy Research Institute. 2015. Nutrition Country Profile: Indonesia. The global average for \nstunting is 23% and for wasting 7.7%.  \n ", "2 \n \nhave doubled in the Indonesian population in the past 15 years:7 (i) among children under 5, 14% \nare overweight (gemuk), compared with the global average of 6%; (ii) 29% of adult women and \n8% of adult men are obese; and (iii) 19% of the population aged 15 or above had excessive \nabdominal fat as measured by waist circumference, which is a strong risk factor for coronary heart \ndiseases. Although kegemukan (overweight) increases with income, the prevalence among the \npoorest men (nearly 10%) and women (almost 20%) does not differ significantly from the three \nhigher wealth quintiles.  \n \n5.  Impact  of  malnutrition.  Malnutrition  undermines  development  potential  and \ncompromises  long-term  economic  outcomes.  Iron-deficiency  anemia  in  school-age  children \ncauses a loss of an estimated six intelligence quotient points per child. Non-stunted children \ncomplete more years of schooling and earn about 20% higher salaries later in life.8 Based on \nconservative assumptions related only to lost productivity, the costs of child under-nutrition in Asia \nare estimated to equal at least 2% of gross domestic product;9 if over-nutrition is included, \nestimated lost productivity could rise to 11% of annual gross domestic product.10 Hunger severely \nreduces the energy level and attention span of children, while iodine deficiency has significant \nirreversible effects on brain development. Overweight and obesity are associated with behavioral \nproblems  in  school,  and  psychosocial  stress  including  stigmatization,  poor  self-image,  and \ndiscrimination.  \n \n6.  Long-term view. A life-cycle, inter-generational perspective is strategically important \nwhen  considering  malnutrition  problems.  Malnutrition  starts  before  conception,  continues \nthroughout childhood (including adolescence), and extends into adulthood. Good nutrition is \nessential for children\u2019s physical and cognitive development. Stunting, for example, is largely \ndetermined by poor maternal nutrition and insufficient nutrition intake in the first 1,000 days of life. \nMalnutrition in women of reproductive age significantly increases the risks of complications in \npregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes for newborns (including stillbirths and preterm \nbirths), and for mothers (including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes \nmellitus, and maternal mortality). Malnourished mothers have less means, awareness, and \nknowledge about proper nutrition for their children, contributing to poor feeding practice and child \nmalnutrition.  Poor  diet  habits  are  likely  to  continue  into  adulthood. When  stunted  children \nexperience rapid weight increase later in life, they have an increased risk of becoming overweight \nor obese, and are thus at higher risk of degenerative diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, \ncoronary heart disease, and stroke.4  \n \n7.  Addressing the double burden of malnutrition. Adolescence is a period of rapid \nphysical and psychosocial development\u2014adolescents experience growth spurts, and puberty \nrequires increased nutrition intake, particularly among adolescent girls, who are also preparing \nfor  their reproductive  roles. Improving  nutrition during  adolescence  may  help  those  with  a \nchallenging childhood to catch up in terms of physical growth and cognitive development. \nAdolescence is also a critical stage when knowledge and attitudes about nutrition are formed, \nwhen behavior changes may have a positive, long-lasting impact. In particular, if adolescent girls \nand young women have improved nutrition knowledge and adopt healthy diets and behaviors, \nthey are more likely to have healthy pregnancies and raise healthy children, contributing to a \n                                                \n7  J.

Investment in young people and adolescents is likely to \nhave immediate health benefits, and help prevent adult malnutrition, long-term noncommunicable \ndiseases, and malnutrition in the next generation.  \n \n8.  The Ministry of Social Affairs  provides capacity building for disadvantaged children \nthrough its social workers. The main instrument to assist street adolescents is conditional cash \ntransfers. The ministry considers its capacity building and conditional cash transfer programs to \nbe insufficient to bring street adolescents back to their homes and schools. Some nongovernment \norganizations have provided street adolescents with free schooling in an effort to benefit their \nlong-term human capital development. Adequate nutrition is vital to achievement of maximum \ndevelopment outcomes in both street adolescents and those enrolled in schools.  \n \n9.  The government views nutrition as a development priority. In 2017, under the leadership \nof the cabinet-level Multi-Sector Committee on Stunting Reduction, the government launched a \nPresidential National Action Plan aiming to address the high stunting levels. Existing efforts to \ntackle the DBM focus on pregnancy and early childhood in the context of maternal and child \nhealth,11 and interventions at adolescence and preconception stages are considered new and \nrelevant.  School-based  nutrition  interventions  may  be  the  most  cost-effective  approach  to \nimproving both the health and academic performance of those in school. Community engagement \nduring marriage registration appears to be a promising channel to support young women at the \npreconception stage.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: quality and competitiveness of human \nresource enhanced in Indonesia. The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge base of \nadolescent nutritional status and nutritional impact on development outcomes enhanced. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n11.  Output 1: Assessment of the double burden of malnutrition among adolescents \nundertaken nationally and in selected cities. Through desktop reviews, key informants, and \nfocus group interviews, the TA will produce an overview of adolescent nutrition in Indonesia, \nincluding information on current nutrition among adolescents, their perception of and challenges \nin accessing a healthy diet, relevant policies and public support for mass nutrition improvement, \nand gaps in achieving the country\u2019s nutrition goals. The TA will identify and confirm the priority \nareas for nutrition interventions and their potential impact based on international experience and \nlocal conditions. The study will select cities and/or districts on the government\u2019s stunting reduction \npriority list. \n \n12.  Output 2: Pilot testing of a set of identified nutrition interventions in appropriate \n                                                \n11 The Ministry of Health organizes a multi-donor collaboration on nutrition, including the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund, World Health Organization, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, Nutrition International, and Hellen Keller \nInternational. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund has done nutrition small-scale accounting studies (in two districts in \nJakarta) and is developing nutrition guidelines for school children. The World Food Programme provides technical \nsupport to the government\u2019s primary school breakfast program and is developing social media campaigns to raise \nawareness of healthy eating. The World Bank invested in early childhood nutrition through a Program-for-Results \nproject. \n \n ", "4 \n \nsettings carried out. Three interventions are planned, each delivered in a phased, clustered, \nrandomized control trial: (i) delivery of a balanced diet to school adolescents through a school \nlunch  program,  targeting  overweight  adolescents,  and  assessing  (before  and  after  the \ninterventions) (a) changes in body mass index, self-reported health, and knowledge of a healthy \ndiet; and (b) academic outcomes; (ii) nutrition education and support for poor street adolescents \nin Jakarta, who often lack awareness of the importance of diet and access to healthy diet; \ninformation and behavioral interventions will be combined to give these often-neglected, most \ndisadvantaged adolescents a boost for healthy development; and (iii)  preconception nutrition \nsupport for newlywed couples, including distribution of multiple micronutrient supplements, and \nhealthy diet information for mothers-to-be. Indonesian women marry at an early age (national \naverage of 19 years old). Interventions at the preconception stage help ensure young women \nenter pregnancy with the nutrition knowledge and nutrition support to enhance health outcomes \nof babies and mothers, and likely prevent stunting.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Impact evaluation of the pilot nutrition interventions undertaken and \nfindings disseminated. The project will deliver and disseminate three impact evaluation study \nreports, publishable articles and/or working papers that summarize the findings from randomized \ncontrolled trials, and a consultation report with policy recommendations to the government. The \nimmediate impacts on food choices and nutritional status will be evaluated, and impacts on school \nperformance and reproductive outcomes will be presented. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.
