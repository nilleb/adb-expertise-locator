INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Nepal has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in \npreparing  an  agriculture  development  strategy (ADS)  with  a  20-year  vision  and  a  10-year \nplanning horizon. In 1995, ADB technical assistance (TA) assisted the government in preparing \nthe  Agriculture  Perspectives  Plan,  1995\u20142015  (APP)  as  Nepal\u2019s  official  agriculture  sector \nframework.1 In view of changes that were not anticipated under the APP, particularly changes in \nthe form of government, a regional situation shaped by rapidly growing regional trade, climate \nchange  impacts  becoming  real  and  visible,  and  the  dual  impacts  of  migrant  labor  and \nurbanization, the government considers a comprehensive revision of the APP to be necessary. \nThis  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  based  on  discussions  between  the \ngovernment and ADB during the reconnaissance mission to Nepal in September 2010 and the \nfact-finding mission in November 2010. These missions met with government agencies, the \nprivate sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and major development partners. Their \nfindings  are  incorporated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  1.  The \ngovernment has requested that the TA be included in the 2010 TA program. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal is one of the poorest countries in Asia, with per capita income of $462 in 2009 and \n31% of the population living in poverty, mostly in rural areas. Agriculture contributes 33% of the \ngross domestic product. Two-thirds of the population lives in rural areas, where 80% of the \nworkforce engages in subsistence agriculture. Productivity remains one of the lowest in Asia. \nConstraints are (i) difficult terrain that is vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters such \nas droughts, floods, and landslides; (ii) poor physical infrastructure; (iii) limited access to inputs, \noutput markets, and financial services; and (iv) low technology base and weak extension.  \n \n3.  The APP aimed to achieve over 4% annual growth in food grain production and higher \nrates for high-value products by improving total factor productivity through (i) the liberalization of \ninput and output markets and (ii) prioritized public investments to improve the provision of \nirrigation, seeds, fertilizer, and agricultural extension, as well as to improve roads. The National \nAgriculture Policy, 2004 and the National Agribusiness Promotion Policy, 2006 provided further \npolicy guidance. Consequently, agriculture sector growth accelerated from 2.6% in 1988\u20131998 \nto 3.6% in 1998\u20132008. Yet performance fell short of targets, as the country has become a net \nimporter of food grains and change in the production mix toward high-value products lags.  \n \n4.  The Three-Year Plan, 2011\u20132013 envisions agriculture changing from subsistence into a \ncompetitive commercial sector that generates employment, reduces poverty, and strengthens \nfood security. The National Agriculture Sector Development Priority Plan, 2011\u20132015 links with \nthe 3-year plan as a strategic framework, but a comprehensive plan is required with deeper \npolicy and legislative analysis; clear targets and resource needs; and coordinated arrangements \nfor implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The plan needs to reflect the current situation \nand a vision for the future. As migrant labor and urbanization bring social and economic change \nto rural areas, regional trade is shaped by rapid economic growth in large neighboring countries. \nClimate change is already having impact at the farm level. The following paragraphs describe \nmajor issues.  \n \n5.  Policy and planning framework. This needs to be reviewed and improved in light of \nchange and the performance of the APP. The 3-year plan proposes policy coordination and \nintegrated economic policy and planning that prioritizes agriculture. This must integrate pricing, \n                                                \n1 ADB. 1993. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Agriculture Perspective Plan. Manila (TA 1854-NEP, \nfor $680,000, approved on 24 March). \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 December 2010.   \n ", "2 \n \ntaxes, and policy support to enable the private sector to play its critical role in agricultural \ndevelopment, providing inputs, services, and markets for outputs. Issues exist regarding trade; \naccess to  suitable  land,  capital,  technology,  and  markets;  and  infrastructure.  Fixed  prices, \ncurrent tax arrangements, regulation, and state competition discourage private investment in \nprocessing and improving quality and food safety. The Agricultural Sector Performance Review \nnoted  sector  improvement  in  the  1990s  related  to  policy  promoting  a  market  economy, \nparticipation, and decentralization.3 The national agriculture policy emphasized cooperatives as \na basis for commercialization, however the legal basis for co-operatives, contract farming and \npublic\u2013private partnerships to facilitate investment is problematic. Some 90% of agricultural \ntrade is with India and the People\u2019s Republic of China, with which Nepal has a deficit of about \n15%. Opportunities include (i) trade agreements and improved border procedures; (ii) replacing \nimports of cereals, wool, meat, and fruit; and (iii) exporting vegetables, fruit, tea, coffee, spices, \nand seeds. Meat, dairy, eggs, and high-value crops are successful, but how best to expand \nproduction is a challenge.  \n \n6.  Institutional  framework.  This  must  distinguish  the  roles  of  the  public  and  private \nsectors.  Decisions  regarding  the  use  of  irrigation  and  fertilizer,  business  structure,  and \ncommercialization  belong  to  the  private  sector.  The  public  sector  can  provide  agricultural \nsupport services, infrastructure, markets, policy, and regulation. The impact of reforms under \nthe APP is modest, and challenges remain to (i) improve accountability in fiscal support, (ii) \nderegulate  the  fertilizer  and  dairy  industries,  (iii)  promote  rural  finance,  and  (iv)  provide \nadequate technical support services. \n \n7.  Productivity, food security, and land reform. Agriculture employs 66% of the work \nforce but contributes only 32% of gross domestic product.4 The major crops that account for \nmore than 80% of cultivated area\u2014rice, maize, wheat, millet, barley, and potatoes are grown \nprimarily for subsistence. Difficult topography, low technology, drought, intense rain, and climate \nchange contribute to keeping yields among the lowest in Asia. Land reform remains a challenge, \nwith 70% of agricultural landholdings smaller than 1 hectare, creating difficulty in aggregation to \na more productive scale. Nepal recently became a net food importer, and malnutrition and food \nscarcity are prevalent. The Nepal Food Corporation cannot fulfill its mandate to ensure food \nsecurity. Strategies to address production conditions and marketing opportunities in Nepal\u2019s \ndiverse agro-climatic regions need to be incorporated into the ADS. \n \n8.  Climate change and forestry. Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries in Asia to \nclimate change, which already causes natural disasters, the loss of pasture and forest, and \nchanges in river hydrology, creating the need for adapted crop varieties. Agriculture, water, and \nother natural resources are also threatened by strong demand, limited capacity for enforcing \nconservation measures, and smuggling, which contributes to deforestation and conflict. The \nnew strategy needs to address climate change impact and adaptation by (i) changing crop \nmixes and land use toward perennial crops, pasture, and agroforestry and (ii) managing grazing \nto improve land cover. \n \n9.  Irrigation and infrastructure. The poor development of roads, markets, and electricity \nsupply (with coverage at only 43%) remain constraints. Irrigation is critical but covers only 2.6 \nmillion hectares, or 42% of the cultivated area. Irrigated yield is substantially lower than potential, \nillustrating the need for better delivery of extension and inputs. There is potential for private \nsector investment in cost-effective tube wells, micro and minor irrigation, rainwater harvesting, \nand  groundwater  use,  supported  by  good  practices  and  value  chain  development.

Manila (TA \n3536-NEP, for $600,000, approved on 4 December).  \n4 Government of Nepal. 2008. Economic Survey. Kathmandu: Ministry of Finance. \n \n ", "3 \n \ngovernment\u2019s district master plans for rural roads and markets need to be integrated with local \nagriculture planning.   \n10.  Agricultural  inputs  and  vocational  skills.  Commercial  agriculture  and  improved \npostharvest techniques and agro-marketing are drivers of sector growth. The challenge is to \nimprove input supply and skills for their use, as well to continue reform. The use of fertilizer and \nimproved seed remains far below APP targets. Quality issues have emerged from inadequate \nregulation.  The  privatization  of  the  Agro-Inputs  Corporation  has  not  progressed  as \nrecommended by the APP.  \n \n11.  Rural  finance.  The  ADB  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Cluster  Program5 is \nassisting this requirement for development through policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional \nreforms, and it suggests that private and NGO services are successful. The challenge is to \nimprove access to finance, reduce transaction costs, and revise distorting policies. \n \n12.  Decentralization.  After  adopting  the  APP,  the  government  progressed  to \ndecentralization with the Local Self-Governance Act, 1999 and now prioritizes development \nthrough  periodic  district  development  plans,  providing  a  local  planning  base  for  an  ADS. \nPrograms with budgets and staffing for agriculture and livestock services have been devolved to \ndistrict development committees. Initiatives have promoted service provision through private \nand NGO agents in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC).  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be sustainable growth in value in an agriculture sector that is more \nresilient to climate change. The tentative performance targets of 4.7% average annual growth in \nagriculture and 6.0% agricultural export growth will be reviewed under the TA. These indicators \nreflect an underlying reduction in poverty, increased farm household incomes, and improved \nfood security supported by the sustainable management of natural resources. \n \n14.  The TA will help the government to prepare a comprehensive development strategy for \nagriculture  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  policy  and  sector  situation  and  wide  stakeholder \nconsultation.  The  outcome  will  be  the  draft  long-term  ADS  submitted  to  the  MOAC.  The \nperformance indicator is the government\u2019s acceptance of the ADS, but it is recognized that \ncommitment to implementing the strategy is outside the scope of the TA.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Using the APP and other recent planning framework documents as the foundation, the \nTA will have four key phases: (i) assessing policy and sector performance and status; (ii) \ndeveloping a vision for the sector; (iii) developing costed policy and strategy options to achieve \nthe vision; and (iv) preparing the ADS. The pillars of the new strategy are expected to be (i) food \nsecurity,  productivity,  connectivity  and  resilience;  (ii)  sustainable  production  and  resource \nmanagement through climate change mitigation and adaptation and improved land and water \nmanagement and water allocation; and (iii) increased private sector development, delivering fair \nreward to all stakeholders in the value chain. Indicative priority areas are (i) the greening of \nagriculture, (ii) commercialization, (iii) an improved business environment, (iv) effective and non-\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n5 ADB. 2006.

The  government\u2019s  strong  ownership  of  the  ADS  is  essential.  The  TA  will  engage \nstakeholders through (i) the project steering committee (PSC); (ii) thematic groups to work on \nsubsector and cross-sector issues with chairs appointed by the PSC, membership that includes \nfarmer association representatives and agribusiness, and facilitation by TA consultants; (iii) an \nexpert review panel (ERP) of national experts and development partners to peer review the \nmain TA reports; (iv) national and regional consultation workshops; and (v) TA consultant field \nvisits and farmer focus group discussions to identify issues and verify that strategy options are \nappropriate. Also strengthening ownership of the outcome will be (i) a Nepal ADS conference \nwith TA-sponsored papers on policy options invited from stakeholders, NGOs, and academia; \nand (ii) the mobilization of two eminent persons to engage more closely with political leaders.  \n \n17.  Phase 1, in months 1\u20135, will be an initial assessment of the sector, project scope, and \nwork plan for the TA inception report to be submitted by week 6 following start-up and discussed \nat a 3-day opening workshop, which will establish the members, roles, and work plans of the \nthematic groups and ERP. Detailed assessment\u2014with field visits, focus group discussions, the \nreview of literature and development of project lessons, and thematic group working sessions \nwith consultants\u2014will result in an assessment report by the end of month 4 covering the APP \nand other policy frameworks, sector status, performance issues, and opportunities. Phase 2, in \nmonths 6\u20138, will develop a vision statement for 2030 that encompasses stakeholders\u2019 views, \nclearly identifying the future situation for each subsector in (i) regional consultation workshops; \n(ii) consultations with senior political leaders, agribusiness, and the communities; and (iii) a \nnational ADS conference to finalize the vision and identify preliminary strategy options.  \n \n18.  Phase 3, in months 9\u201314, will be the preparation of detailed policy and strategy options \nto achieve the vision. The TA will (i) estimate the resources required, benefits and costs, and \ntime frame for each option; (ii) analyze the costs, impacts, benefits, and viability of the options; \nand (iii) prepare an ADS options report for submission to the PSC, ERP, and thematic groups \nfor review prior to a PSC meeting to consolidate comments and select options. During phase 4, \nin months 15\u201324, the TA will prepare the detailed 2030 ADS with road maps and cost estimates \nto guide implementation. The PSC, thematic groups, and ERP will peer review the draft ADS, on \nthe basis of which the TA will finalize it for submission to the government as the TA outcome.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA will be financed by (i) a $1,500,000 grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-IV),  (ii)  a  $500,000  grant  from  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment to be administered by ADB, and (iii) $100,000 in counterpart financing from the \nGovernment  of  Nepal.  ADB  will  finance  consulting  services,  workshops,  equipment,  and \noperations.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The International \nFund for Agricultural Development will also finance consulting services. The government will \ncontribute premises, staff time, a vehicle, government operations, and taxes and duties. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Institutional arrangements. The MOAC will be the executing agency and establish the \nPSC to guide policy and strategy and coordinate agencies. The PSC will be co-chaired by the \nMOAC and the Ministry of Finance. PSC members will be staff not lower than joint secretary \nlevel in the National Planning Commission, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industry, Ministry \n ", "5 \n \nof Forestry, Ministry of Irrigation, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Development, Ministry of \nLaw and Justice, and the private sector, including the Federation of the Nepalese Chambers of \nCommerce and Industries and apex farmers\u2019 organizations. The TA will commence in January \n2011 and be completed by December 2012. \n \n21.    The government will (i) appoint a class one or senior class two person as the project \ndirector and (ii) assign two full-time senior staff to the TA throughout the TA period. The PSC \nwill appoint a TA coordinating committee chaired by the MOAC to ensure smooth TA operation \nand the participation of policy, planning, and technical line departments and agencies. \n \n22.    The  PSC  will  appoint  senior  staff  to  chair  the  thematic  groups  and  ensure  the \ncommunication of the many crosscutting issues with other groups. Individual consultants will \nfacilitate and support the groups. Keeping to agricultural issues, thematic groups will address (i) \npolicy,  legislation,  regulation,  and  institutional  development;  (ii)  agriculture  and  livestock, \nincluding research and extension; (iii) irrigation; (iv) agribusiness, commerce, and trade; (v) rural \nfinance; (vi) taxation and fiscal policy and strategy; (vii) food security, health, and food safety; \n(viii) climate change, the environment, forestry, and natural resource management; (ix) land \nreform  and  gender  and  rural  social  development;  and  (x)  rural  infrastructure  and  local \ndevelopment.  \n \n23.  The MOAC will provide a minimum of 400 square meters of office space for the term of \nthe TA, a vehicle and driver, communications facilities, and two full-time staffers to coordinate \nwith stakeholders. The TA will provide office refurbishment; furniture; office equipment including \ncomputers, printers, a copier, a generator, and internet access; and a second two-wheel-drive \nvehicle, purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The TA will hire a driver office staff, including an office administration manager \nand two office assistants responsible for running the office, accounts, communications, errands, \ndocumentation and records, and workshop and travel arrangements.  At the completion of the \nTA, assets will be turned over top the MOAC. \n \n24.  Consulting  services. The TA will use 48 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 95 person-months of national, including unallocated person-months to address \nunforeseen issues. ADB will engage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). International consultants and the national \ndeputy team leader will be recruited as individuals. ADB will recruit national consultants through \na  firm  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  at  a  ratio  of  80:20  and  bio-data  technical \nproposals. The composition of the consultant team and terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  The ADS will be formally disseminated through government mechanisms led by the \nMOAC, National Planning Commission, and Ministry of Finance. The TA will also disseminate \nthe ADS through stakeholder engagement. The MOAC planning and monitoring and evaluation \ndivisions will evaluate the ADS. It is proposed that ADB undertake a sector review within 5 years \nof ADS implementation. \n \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n26.
