During the 2002 country programming mission, the Government of Indonesia requested \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare a project for flood management in selected river basins in \nJava  to  reduce  floods  through  integrated  river  basin  management  and  ensure  active \nparticipation of local communities in flood management. The Mission held detailed discussions \nwith  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  and  the  ministries  of \nsettlements  and  regional  infrastructure (MSRI), finance  (MOF), forestry  (MOFr),  and  home \naffairs  (MOHA),  on  the  rationale,  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  implementation \narrangements, and financing plan for the TA. The Mission also met with the officials of the World \nBank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and \nthe  Netherlands  Embassy  in  Jakarta.  The  TA  has  been  designed  to  be  in  line  with  the \nGovernment's priorities and anticipated initiatives, as well as with the current emphasis of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  Indonesia.  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB's  2003  country \nassistance program for Indonesia.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Flood  damage  in  Java  has  become  more  serious  year  by  year.  In  January  2002, \napproximately 100 km2 (15%) out of 650 km2 around Jakarta were flooded. The flood claimed \nlives of 80 people and the destruction continued for more than 1 month. The physical damage \nwas estimated at Rp5.4 trillion ($635 million) together with indirect economic losses of Rp4.5 \ntrillion ($529 million).  \n \n3.  Floods impact more severely on the poor as they tend to live in river basins and the \nflood-prone areas. Livelihood opportunities of the poor are also vulnerable to flood surges. \nFrequent  flooding  causes  poverty  and  human  suffering  and  is  a  major  constraint  on \nsocioeconomic development.  \n \n4.  The Government has implemented a number of flood control projects mostly with its own \nresources. ADB has financed three flood control projects, of which one has been completed and \ntwo are in advanced stage of implementation. Lessons learned from the past and ongoing \nprojects indicate that removal of the threat of frequent flooding will require (i) a holistic approach \nto flood management within a river basin through a combination of structural and non-structural \nmeasures; (ii) participation of local governments and people in planning and implementing \npreventive measures; (iii) improvement of flood warning systems; and (iv) adequate level of \nfunding for completed facilities. \n \n5.  Past efforts emphasized controlling floods by structural measures such as confining \nfloodwater between artificial embankments, which needed to be continually higher and stronger \nto protect growing cities on the floodplain. Little attention has been paid to manage watersheds \nwhich  have  degraded  over  the  years  because  of  the  conversion  of  forest  and  uplands  to \nagricultural  and  other  uses.  Watershed  management  consists  of  integrated  environmental \nactivities related to the use and modification of land and water of an entire watershed system, \nfrom the uplands to downstream, to floodplain wetlands and river channels, considering the \neconomic costs and benefits, and the sustainability of the watershed ecosystem. People living in \nand  around  watersheds  are  the  main  subsystem  of  integrated  watershed  management. \nImproving watershed management includes promoting people\u2019s participation in decision making \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in January 2003.  ", "2    \nthrough  social  forestry  programs  carried  out  on  publicly-owned  forestland  and  community-\nmanaged lands. \n \n6.  Responsibility  for  watershed  management  lies  with  the  MOFr,  which  lacks  the \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  carrying  out  this  mandate.  In  particular,  flood  protection \nmanagement  and  watershed  management  should  be  linked,  especially  when  nonstructural \nmeans (such as reforestation, regreening, and agroforestry) can enhance cost effectiveness of \nflood management. The biophysical boundaries of watersheds do not always coincide with \nadministrative boundaries and river basins. Therefore, the institutional arrangements for flood \nmanagement should involve multidisciplinary and interagency partnerships. Coordination and \nintegration requisites for watershed management and river basins have become more complex \nas local governments acquire more responsibilities under the decentralization process currently \nunderway. \n \n7.  Decentralization and devolution of authority to local governments in recent years have \nincreased the need to strengthen provincial and district capability for river basin and flood \nmanagement. The central Government is responsible for managing rivers that flow across \nprovinces. Provincial governments are responsible for managing rivers that flow across districts \nwithin the province. District and/or city governments have the authority for management of the \nriver sections flowing through their jurisdiction, including conservation, and to use them for the \nbenefit of the districts and/or cities concerned. To fulfill this mandate, the districts and/or city \ngovernments  are  responsible  for  preparing,  in  consultation  with  central  and  provincial \ngovernments,  a  master  plan  of  river  basin  management,  and  for  issuing  all  permits  and \ndocuments required for river utilization. However, flood management coordination mechanisms \nare absent among these various local governments which share a river. \n \n8.  Where  administrative  boundaries  separate  the  upper  watershed  area  from  the \ndownstream flood-prone area, district governments in the upstream area normally do not have \nadequate incentives to undertake watershed management activities such as reforestation and \nconstruction  of  erosion  control  structures.  Coordination  mechanisms  between  district \ngovernments for watershed management need to be improved and incentives for upper district \ngovernments to maintain the watershed need to be established. Income generation activities for \npeople in the upper catchment need to be developed, and community-based initiatives should \nbe encouraged to protect watersheds on a sustainable, long-term basis. \n \n9.  Planning mechanisms to restrict land use and control development activities in flood \nretention basins and wetlands also need to be developed. In many areas, local people have \nencroached on flood retention basins, thereby reducing the wetlands continually. Flood-prone \nareas should not be developed for residential purposes unless the affected communities are \nprepared to pay for flood protection works. Watershed areas should also be protected from \nillegal  encroachment.  The  different  levels  of  protection  required  for  agricultural  lands  and \nresidential areas need to be decided.  \n \n10.  Many flood warning systems do not have proper communication links to the flood-\naffected communities. Similarly, flood hazard maps do not exist for many flood-prone areas.  \nThese are required to plan land use and develop early warning procedures to evacuate people \nliving  in  these  areas.  Flood  forecasting  and  warning  systems,  flood  hazard  mapping,  and \nevacuation planning need to be closely linked in the river basin. \n \n11.  The provincial basin management units (Balai PSDAs) under the provincial governments \nare responsible for the operation and maintenance of flood management facilities, but these ", "  3\norganizations are underfunded, with weak staff capacity, and some have only recently been \nestablished under the decentralization policy. Balai PSDA staff should be trained in planning, \noperation, and maintenance of flood management facilities. Cost recovery mechanisms need to \nbe studied and used to make flood management facilities sustainable.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare a feasibility study for an investment project to \nprevent disasters and reduce social, economic, and environmental impacts from flooding in \nselected river basins in Java through community and local government participation in flood \nmanagement.   \n \n13.  The TA will help the Government (i) identify the best strategy to support comprehensive \nflood management planning for river basins; (ii) strengthen the capacity of central, provincial, \nand district governments and Balai PSDA staff for integrated river basin management; (iii) \nprioritize four river basins and prepare a feasibility study for at least two; and (iv) formulate a \nproject for improved flood management of selected river basins in Java, for possible funding by \nADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will (i) review the Government's flood management strategies, priorities, and \ninvestment  plans,  and  recommend  necessary  resources  for  institutional  strengthening, \ncoordination  improvement,  policy  reforms,  and  sustainable  project  financing,  including  cost \nrecovery; (ii) formulate a flood management plan and watershed management plan for at least \ntwo river basins based on technical, institutional, environmental, social, economic, financial, and \nother relevant factors; (iii) recommend participatory approaches to selection and formulation of \nflood protection measures, including the role of women; (iv) integrate sound environmental \nmanagement and increased social awareness into the planning, design, and implementation \nframeworks  of  flood  management;  (v)  design  the  project  to  benefit  the  poor  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups; (vi) assess the need for improved flood forecasting, flood warning, and \ndisaster preparedness; (vii) prepare a plan for public awareness and emergency preparedness, \nwith special attention to gender concerns; (viii) prepare the flood zoning map in the selected \nriver basins; (ix) prioritize four river basins for feasibility studies in phase 2; (x) analyze the \nfinancial capability of the local government concerned and source of financing; (xi) conduct a \nfeasibility study on the river basins; and (xii) recommend implementation mechanisms and \nexecuting and implementing agencies for the project. A preliminary project framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over 10 months. In phase 1 (3 months), the \nconsultants  will  work  closely  with  BAPPENAS,  MSRI,  MOFr,  MOHA,  and  Ministry  of \nEnvironment to review and assess the Government's flood management plan and/or activities, \ndefine an institutional setting for the flood management plan, and prepare a prioritized shortlist \nof four river basins out of the nine river basins in Java for the feasibility study in the phase 2. \nThe criteria for selection of river basins will include: (i) frequency and severity of flooding; (ii) \nextent and severity of watershed degradation; (iii) level of cooperation among the regional \ngovernments within the river basin; and (iv) local governments\u2019 commitment to the proposed ", "4    \nproject.2 The river basins to be taken up for the TA will be identified and submitted to the TA \ncoordination committee and ADB at least 1 week before the tripartite meeting to be held at the \nend of phase 1. A consultation meeting will be held with local governments in the provinces and \ndistricts  where  the  river  basins  are  located to  discuss  the  scope  of  the  project  with  local \ngovernment officials and other key stakeholders 1 month after consultant services start. A 2-day \nworkshop will be held before the end of phase 1.  \n \n16.  The implementation arrangements to be proposed by the consultant for the ensuing \ninvestment  project  will  take  into  account  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the  central, \nprovincial and district governments under the evolving decentralization process. The executing \nagencies (EAs) and implementing agencies (IAs) will also be identified accordingly. If several \nEAs and IAs are proposed, then the structure and workplan of the project management unit will \nbe agreed among the proposed EAs and IAs before proceeding to phase 2.  \n \n17.  Subject to the satisfactory conclusion of phase 1, the consultants will commence phase \n2 of the TA during which feasibility studies on the river basin groups will be undertaken. The \nconsultants will review and incorporate lessons learned from past and ongoing similar projects \ninto the feasibility studies. The implications of the MOF Decree 35 of 2003 on cost sharing on \nthe proposed project will be examined and adequately addressed in the feasibility study report. \nA 1-day workshop will be held to discuss the draft final report immediately after its submission.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total TA cost is estimated at $1.57 million equivalent, of which $692,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $878,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested  financing  on  a  grant  basis  of  (i)  $250,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  Funding \nProgram; and (ii) $1 million equivalent, cofinanced by the Government of the Netherlands, to \njointly finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $558,000 of the local currency cost. The \nGovernment will provide the balance of the local currency cost of $320,000 equivalent through \nthe provision of experienced counterpart staff, office space, data, administrative and clerical \nservices, and communications. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. The Government has \nbeen advised that approval of the TA does not commit the ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  EA  for  the  TA  at  the  national  level  will  be  the  Directorate  General  of  Water \nResources (DGWR) of MSRI. DGWR will work closely with BAPPENAS, MOFr, MOF, and \nMOHA. Although the program will be nationally coordinated in accordance with Indonesia's \npolicy on regional administration (Republic Law 22/1999), the program will be implemented at \nthe  decentralized  levels  of  administration  with  the  bulk  of  planning,  implementation,  and \ncapacity building taking place at the local level. Close coordination and effective linkages will be \nestablished among national, provincial, and local governments.  \n \n20.  A TA Coordination Committee (TACC), chaired by a senior officer in BAPPENAS, will be \nestablished to review the progress and outputs of the TA. Initially, the committee will include \nsenior representatives from the DGWR of MSRI, and from MOFr and MOHA. In phase 2, \nrepresentatives of the target provinces and the study district will join the TACC. It will meet \n                                                \n2  The Government has made an initial selection of the following four river basins: (i) Ciujung-Cileman, (ii) Pekalen-\nSampeyan, (iii) JERATUNSELUNA, and (iv) Progo-Opak-Oyo.  ", "  5\nmonthly during TA implementation. The Government has assured the availability of counterpart \nfund and staff support for timely completion of the TA.  \n \n21.  Twenty-five  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  65  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants will be engaged through an international consulting firm. A team leader \ncum integrated river basin management specialist, an international consultant, will work full-time \nin Indonesia for the duration of the TA study. Expertise will be required in the areas of water \nresources  planning,  integrated  river  basin  management,  hydrology,  hydraulic  structure \nengineering, sociology, rural income generation, land and watershed management and spatial \nplanning, community participation and institutional strengthening, environment, and agricultural \nand natural resources economics. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality-and-cost-based selection method, and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will be \nundertaken over 10 months commencing in November 2003. An outline of terms of reference for \nthe consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner. Local governments and \ncommunities, including women\u2019s groups, will be consulted to select groups of river basins to be \nstudied in the phase 2 of the TA. Stakeholders will be consulted and their representatives \ninvited to the first workshop to be held at the end of phase 1. A summary initial poverty and \nsocial analysis is in Appendix 4. \n \n23.  The consultants will submit three reports.3 The inception report, to be submitted within 1 \nmonth after the TA starts, will summarize the initial findings and, if necessary, present an \nupdated work plan to reflect specific issues identified. The interim report, to be submitted 1 \nweek before the end of phase 1, will describe its findings and recommendations together with a \ndraft project framework, and be reviewed in a tripartite meeting among senior government \nrepresentatives, consultants, and ADB. The draft final report will be submitted 2 weeks before \nthe end of phase 2. The consultants will submit 20 copies each of the inception and interim \nreports, 30 copies of the draft final report, and 20 copies of the final report. The final report will \nbe submitted 2 weeks after the final tripartite meeting. All reports will be prepared in English, \nand the executive summary translated into Bahasa Indonesia. All other translations will be the \nresponsibility of the EA and undertaken at the EA's discretion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the Netherlands, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nIndonesia for preparing the Flood Management in Selected River Basins Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n3  Electronic files in the CD-ROM should also be submitted.

Based on the \nfield reconnaissance and information collected, a prioritized list for the selection of at least two \nriver basin groups in phase 2 will be prepared. The inception report will describe the preliminary \nfindings and recommend revisions to the work plan. \n  \n2.  Review and Assessment of Flood Management Plan/Activities \n3.  The  consultants  will  review  and  assess  the  central  and  local  governments\u2019  flood \nmanagement plans and/or activities to arrive at a cost-effective, technically sound, and socially \nacceptable plan.1 The following will be examined: \n \n(i)  appropriateness of objectives and strategies; \n(ii)  institutional capacity and proposals to overcome identified weaknesses; \n(iii)  adequacy of legal and regulatory frameworks, and procedures for endorsement; \n(iv)  adequacy of financial resources of agencies responsible for aspects of flood \nmanagement; \n(v)  socioeconomic analyses of how the proposed flood protection measures will \nbenefit the community, especially the poor and other disadvantaged groups; \n(vi)  adequacy of environmental safeguards and procedures, and capacity to manage \nenvironmental plans and monitor environmental conditions; \n                                                \n1  If local governments do not have flood management plans, the consultant will prepare a draft plan for the river \nbasin concerned.  ", "10 Appendix 3 \n(vii)  adequacy of provisions relating to land-use planning, flood hazard zoning and \nmapping, risk assessment, and prevention of encroachment on unsafe areas; \n(viii)  adequacy of emergency response and flood recovery measures; and  \n(ix)  status of operation and maintenance of flood control facilities. \n \n3.  Recommendations  \n4.  The  consultants  will  prepare  a  report  describing  the  major  elements  of  the \ncomprehensive  flood  management  plan  for  the  river  basins,  including  recommendations  to \nmodify or improve the Government\u2019s plan and/or activities. The report will cover (i) planning \nmeasures;  (ii)  development  and  land-use  controls;  (iii)  structural  measures;  (iv)  transfer  of \npayment  (compensation)  from  downstream  beneficiaries  to  upstream  beneficiaries;  (v) \ninstitutional issues of responsibility for flood management; (vi) effectiveness of nonstructural \nmeasures,  (vii)  role  of  local  governments,  communities,  and  Balai  PSDA;  (viii)  effective \ncoordination mechanisms between district governments for watershed management; and (ix) \nissues related to financing mechanisms for on-lending and/or on-grant to local governments in \nwhich  should  be  mentioned  in  the  independent  section  of  the  report,  in  relation  to  the \ndecentralization  policy  (Republic  Law  22/1999  and  25/1999)  and  the  decision  of  minister \n(KEPMEN 35). The consultants should coordinate closely with BAPPENAS on ongoing flood \ncontrol policy formulation.  \n \n5.  The consultants will support all conclusions and recommendations with analyses of \ndifferent options, and present the findings in the interim report, which will also set out programs \n(including  terms  of  reference,  costs,  and  implementation  arrangements)  for  any  additional \nsurveys, investigations, and studies to be carried out during the phase 2 or as part of the project. \nA tripartite meeting will be held to review the interim report, following which the Government and \nADB will jointly decide on at least two river basin groups for feasibility study during the phase 2. \n \n4.  Workshops and Local Government Consultation \n6.  Since the TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, consultation meetings \nmust be held with stakeholders, including women\u2019s groups. The local government consultation \nmeeting will be held to explain the scope of the project to local government officials 1 month after \nconsultant services start. Based on the data collection and detailed selection criteria set forth by \nthe consultant, the prioritized shortlist of the river basin groups should be submitted to the TA \ncoordination committee and ADB one week before the tripartite meeting to be held at the end of \nthe phase 1. A 2-day workshop will be held at the end of the phase 1 to discuss the concept of \nflood management and the selection of at least two river basin groups for the phase 2. A 2-day \nworkshop will be held at the end of the phase 1 to discuss the concept of flood management and \nthe selection of river basin groups. \n  \nB.  Phase 2: Preparation of an Investment Project  \n1.  Feasibility Studies \n7.  The consultants will undertake feasibility studies for the subprojects to formulate the \nmajor  works  components,  together  with  their  costs  and  justification.  Where  possible,  the \nconsultants will use existing studies and reports and undertake supplementary studies to update \nthem as necessary. The proposed scope should be presented to the communities, and their \ncomments incorporated in the scope. The consultants will consider the need for (i) capacity \nbuilding of local government agencies, (ii) community participation for flood management, (iii) ", "Appendix 3  11\n \nwatershed  management,  (iv)  public  awareness  for  flood  management,  and  (v)  structural \nmeasures for flood management in each subproject. \n \n8.  A consultant will undertake a social analysis for each selected river basin to identify (i) \ngroups who will benefit from and/or use the proposed works, (ii) groups who may be adversely \naffected  by  the  works,  (iii)  indigenous  people,  (iv)  gender  concerns,  and  (v)  other  major \nstakeholders.2 Each social analysis will describe the needs, demands, and absorptive capacity of \nthe groups, and will consider the need to compensate those likely to be adversely affected. \nSocioeconomic data, including current urban and rural population levels and migration trends, \ngrowth predictions, presence of minority peoples, land use and tenure, employment, gender \nissues, division of labor, and productivity and family incomes will be derived from secondary \nsources supplemented by interviews and rapid rural appraisals. Particular attention will be given \nto discerning differences in the extent and severity of poverty among beneficiaries and the \npopulation as a whole. An assessment of the impact on indigenous people should be prepared in \naccordance with ADB's Operations Manual on Indigenous Peoples. \n \n9.  Consultants will prepare records of all interviews and discussions, with a summary of the \nmajor points of discussion and the views of the group concerned. Socioeconomic profiles will be \nprepared for vulnerable groups and for all groups who may be adversely affected by the project. \nFor each selected river basin, the consultants will describe the following: \n \n(i)  effective measures to reduce the vulnerability of the poor, especially women, to \nfloods; \n(ii)  beneficiaries\u2019 willingness and capability to contribute in cash or kind to implement \nand maintain works; \n(iii)  procedures to be adopted during project implementation to (a) ensure beneficiary \nand stakeholder participation in selection and formulation of works, (b) respect \ncultural needs and existing patterns of livelihood, and (c) enhance the positive \nimpacts of project works; \n(iv)  institutional development and training needs under the project; \n(v)  additional  interventions  that  may  be  needed  to  complement  works  proposed \nunder  the  project  (such  as  improved  drinking  water  supplies,  collection  and \ndisposal  of  solid  and  liquid  wastes,  and  improved  treatment  of  effluents \ndischarging to surface and groundwater bodies); and \n(vi)  benefit  and  poverty  impact  monitoring  activities,  disaggregated  by  gender \nwherever possible.3 \n \n10.  The consultants will prepare a resettlement policy framework, which will cover all land \nacquisition and resettlement activities of the project. For any structures that may entail significant \nland/house acquisition or disruption of livelihood, the consultants will prepare a resettlement plan \nfollowing the requirements of the ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \nThe consultant will prepare the land acquisition and resettlement policy framework to be applied \nto the project in consultation with the central, provincial, and district governments.  \n \n11.  The consultants will prepare a gender action plan to reflect the gender analysis of the \nrole of men and women during and after floods, including recommendations for strategies and \nactivities to reduce the economic burden of women during and after floods.  \n                                                \n2  The procedures to conduct social analyses using rapid appraisal techniques are described in ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nPoverty and Social Analysis (December 2001). \n3  Prepared in accordance with ADB's Handbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. ", "12 Appendix 3 \n12.  In accordance with ADB's environmental policy, recently approved by the Board4, the \nconsultants  will  prepare  an  initial  environmental  examination  and/or  environmental  impact \nassessment,  if  warranted,  following  the  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  ADB \n(March  1998).  The  environmental  assessments  should  identify  all  positive  and  negative \nenvironmental and social impacts. The consultants will recommend measures (including changes \nin the design) to eliminate, offset, or reduce adverse impacts to an acceptable limit. Wherever \nfeasible,  the  consultants  will  identify  complementary  works  to  enhance  the  positive \nenvironmental  impacts  of  proposed  works.  Costs  and  benefits  of  all  such  measures  and \ncomplementary works will be estimated.  \n \n13.  A draft environmental management plan will be prepared for each subproject to describe \nthe  procedures  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring,  including  institutional \narrangements, tasks and implementation schedules, estimated costs, reporting arrangements \nand schedules, and any special measures such as training, public involvement activities, and so \nforth. The plans will be finalized during the detailed design phase. \n \n14.  The consultants will analyze local governments\u2019 capability to fund their contribution to \nthe proposed project, and their sources of funds. The analyses should follow the rules and \nregulations of the government financing policy for local governments (KEPMEN 35). \n \n15.  The consultants will analyze the economic benefits and costs and will calculate the \neconomic internal rate of return, perform sensitivity and risk analyses, and calculate switching \nvalues  for  each  subproject  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects and Economic Analysis of Environmental Impacts of Development Projects.5 COSTAB \nsoftware program should be used to estimate the project cost. The consultants will also examine \nthe distribution of project costs and benefits, in financial and economic terms, allocated to the \nvarious stakeholders, and estimate the distribution of project effects on the poor to determine \ntheir poverty impact (Appendix 4), as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact \nAssessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \n2.  Formulation of a Flood Management Project \n16.  The consultants will formulate a flood management project in the selected river basins. \nSpecific attention will be given to (i) financing plans and mechanisms for cost recovery; (ii) \narrangements  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  project  facilities  with  capacity-building \nmechanisms; (iii) framework for monitoring and evaluation of project benefits; (iv) flood hazard \nmapping  to  determine  the  likely  effects  of  flooding  in  the  basins  and  develop  a  flood \nmanagement strategy to minimize the economic cost of flooding rather than try to prevent it; (v) \ncommunity participation in flood management, emergency actions, and rehabilitation; (vi) flood \nforecast  and  early  flood  warning  system;  (vii)  development  of  flood  preparedness  in  the \ncommunities; (viii) flood insurance mechanisms; (ix) watershed management, including income \ngeneration  and  community-based  land  and  natural  resources  management;  (x)  financial \nsustainability of asset management of river infrastructure; (xi) restriction of land use in the basin; \n(xii) children's education program on community participation in flood management; (xiii) gender \nconcerns in flood management; (xiv) contract packaging (including procurement arrangements), \nwork schedules, and detailed implementation arrangements; and (xv) development of a logical \nframework  along  with  the  progress  of  the  study.  The  consultant  will  recommend  executing \n                                                \n4  R154-02: Environment Policy, approved in November 2002. \n5  The consultant\u2019s economist will visit ADB before mobilization on site to receive guidance on the economic analyses \nto be conducted.

Yes  priority in country poverty                                Yes \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n  Poverty incidence soared from 14.7% in early 1997 to a peak of 23.5% in early 1999, demonstrating the \nvulnerability of the poor to inflationary shocks, especially to food price increases. Many communities, particularly \nthose living on or near degraded watersheds, have little access to land and other resources, and suffer poverty levels \nas  high  as  80%.  One  project  component  will  provide  improved  livelihood  and  sustained  income-generating \nopportunities to such communities by increasing production and marketing of legal forest products and food as a \nresult of increased access to land and improved management of resources. One project component will focus on \ncreating  and  supporting  community  management  groups,  and  sustaining  institutional  (government  and \nnongovernment) arrangements to support communities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification:    Environment \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nDuring the initial phase of the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), the consultants will compile \navailable  data  on  poverty  and  degraded  lands,  using  geographic  information  systems  and  poverty  mapping \ntechniques to link the information for use in selected river basins and communities, and to provide a baseline \ndatabase to monitor the project. The consultants will also review and document ongoing and completed community-\nbased land and natural resources management activities to identify successful schemes, on the basis of which at \nleast two river basins will be selected for further in-depth study as subprojects. \nA  poverty  analysis  will  examine  (i)  past  and  present  negative  impacts  of  floods  and  related \ndisasters/degradation on livelihoods of people; (ii) their coping strategies to address short- and long-term impacts \n(e.g. migration; selling children, livestock, and land; borrowing money); and (iii) gender dimensions of (i) and (ii). The \nstudy will also estimate the expected impact of project interventions on poor communities, other stakeholders \n(including intermediaries and nongovernment organizations [NGOs]), and the government (distinguishing between \nlocal governments and the national Government). The study will also examine the distribution of project costs and \nbenefits, in financial and economic terms, allocated to the various stakeholders, and estimate the distribution of \nproject effects on the poor to determine their poverty impact, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty \nImpact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: During the review of ongoing and completed schemes, the consultants will identify and \nconsult all stakeholders to determine the roles and functions of the target groups and to understand supply chains to \nmarkets. The consultants will undertake a rapid rural appraisal or similar approach to gather background information \non the communities, meet with key individuals and other community members, and engage in dialogue to identify \ndevelopment needs and constraints. The outcome of this analysis will form the basis to propose selection criteria and \nspecific mechanisms for community inclusion, and identify target communities under the project.  \n \nParticipation strategy required: The community participation strategy will be developed during the phase 2 of the \nPPTA, including cost-sharing arrangements, operation and maintenance arrangements, and community-level training \nmechanisms considering women\u2019s participation.  The technical assistance (TA) will be implemented in a fully \nparticipatory manner, and the consultants will organize at least two participatory stakeholder workshops during TA \nimplementation  to  discuss  the  approach  and  findings  with  key  central,  provincial,  and  district  agencies; \nrepresentatives of target communities; external agencies; NGOs; research organizations; and other interested \nparties. \n \nD.
