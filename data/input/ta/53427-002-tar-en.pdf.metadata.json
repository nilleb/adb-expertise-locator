The proposed loan to Vietnam International Commercial Joint Stock Bank (VIB) will \nprovide financing to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) including women-owned and \nwomen-led SMEs women-led SMEs (WSMEs) and for home improvements and repair. This \nsupport is particularly timely because of the disproportionate impact that the coronavirus disease \nis having on SMEs. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Gender disparities in lending to SMEs impede the success of thousands of WSMEs in Viet \nNam. WSMEs experience an estimated financing gap of $1.2 billion, and only 37% of WSMEs in \nViet Nam access bank loans, compared to 47% of men-led SMEs. There is generally a lack of \ndifferentiated marketing approaches in Viet Nam for WSMEs as well as preconceptions that they \nare less profitable, riskier, and less financially savvy. This negatively impacts women\u2019s ability to \naccess financing. Social expectations about women\u2019s roles can lead to additional biases.1 \n \n3.  To address these issues, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) developed and successfully \nsubmitted a $14 million grant and technical assistance (TA) funding application to the Women \nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) for Viet Nam.2 The application designated approximately \n$4.5 million of the funds to support nonsovereign financial sector transactions, of which $0.5 \nmillion will be allocated to this TA. The loan to VIB is ADB\u2019s first non-sovereign transaction to \nincorporate We-Fi funding.  \n \n4.  VIB, like many banks in Viet Nam, does not currently prioritize WSMEs. They are collecting \nlimited  information  on  their  WSME  clients  and  cannot  generate  gender-disaggregated \nmanagement information system (MIS) reports. Marketing materials are not oriented to WSMEs, \nloan officers lack training on the specific needs of women clients, and there are opportunities for \nVIB to educate existing and potential WSME clients on how best to present their businesses when \napplying for a loan and what lending products are available. This transaction TA would help VIB \naddress these deficiencies.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output 1: Vietnam International Commercial Joint Stock Bank\u2019s financing to small \nand medium-sized enterprises in general and women entrepreneurs in particular expanded. \nVIB plans to target $50 million of the ADB loan for SMEs, including WSMEs. The attached TA will \ncollect data on the impact of this lending on a sample of VIB\u2019s WSME clients. This data collection \nis  intended  to  have  a  demonstration  effect  that  will  encourage  VIB  to  develop  more \ncomprehensive gender-disaggregated data and to show that WSMEs are bankable clients. It will \nalso help VIB, ADB, and other stakeholders better understand how the coronavirus disease is \nimpacting WSME businesses. \n \n \n1  International Finance Corporation. 2017. MSME Finance Gap. Assessment of the Shortfalls and Opportunities in \nFinancing Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Emerging Markets. Washington, DC. \n2  We-Fi is a groundbreaking partnership that aims to unlock financing for women-led and women-owned businesses \nin developing countries. We-Fi\u2019s partners include 14 donor governments, six multilateral development banks as \nimplementing partners, and numerous other stakeholders in the public and private sector around the world. \n \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Output 2: Vietnam International Commercial Joint Stock Bank\u2019s capacity to serve \nwomen entrepreneurs strengthened. The TA will help VIB reach women clients through \ndeveloping promotional materials designed to specifically connect with WSMEs. Additionally, the \nTA will work with VIB to develop an online gender-sensitivity training program for its loan officers, \nwhose explicit and implicit biases can drive gender disparities in bank lending. The training will \nbe designed so that at the end of the TA, VIB will have the capacity to continue the training without \nthe support of external consultants. Additionally, VIB will upgrade its MIS to analyze its portfolio \nby gender. This is a precondition for helping VIB to engage women clients more meaningfully in \nthe future. \n \n7.  Output 3: Capacity of women entrepreneurs enhanced. Although financial institutions \nmay want to lend more to WSMEs, there can be asymmetries between the information that banks \nrequire to assess a loan application and the information that SMEs, including WSMEs, know how \nto provide. To address this deficiency, VIB is planning at least 10 training seminars around the \ncountry that will (i) train WSMEs on the various available financial products, (ii) train WSMEs on \nhow to prepare loan applications, and (iii) connect WSMEs to local VIB loan officers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  (financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  We-Fi  and \nadministered by ADB) plus VIB\u2019s in-kind contributions, such as: staff costs, office costs, related \ntaxes and duties...etc.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 35 months from February 2021 to December \n2023. ADB will administer the TA. Using a One ADB approach, the Viet Nam Resident Mission \nwill assume responsibility for TA administration. Implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  February 2021\u2013December 2023  \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Viet Nam Resident Mission \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: quality- Vietnam International Commercial  $500,000 \nand cost- Joint Stock Bank Women-Led Small \nbased  and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nselection  Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.

We-Fi requirements. The TA is aligned with We-Fi\u2019s guidelines. VIB will report to ADB its \nlending to WSMEs against We-Fi\u2019s definition of WSMEs,3 and ADB will update We-Fi on the \nresults of the TA annually. A sampling of VIB\u2019s WSME clients and the strengthening of VIB\u2019s MIS, \nwhich are components of the TA, will support this reporting. \n \n3  Per We-Fi\u2019s definition, WSMEs are defined as borrowing in an amount between $5,000 and $1 million and by either \n(i) being at least 51% owned by women or a woman, or (ii) meeting all of the following 3 sub-criteria: (a) it is at least \n20% owned by a woman or women, (b) a woman is the senior or second most senior executive, and (c) at least 30% \nof the board members are women (where a board exists). \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20210416120036+08'00'", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Microsoft 365", "Keywords": "vietnam, vib, wefi, joint stock bank, smes, small and medium-sized enterprises, women entrepreneurs, home improvements, women empowerment, gender equality, access to finance, 53427-002, adb technical assistance, approved technical assistance, tar, ta projects, trta", "ModDate": "D:20210419113011+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.27", "Subject": "Technical Assistance Report", "Title": "53427-002: Women-Led Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises"}}
