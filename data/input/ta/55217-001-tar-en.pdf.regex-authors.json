THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will undertake climate risk assessments, \nproject preparation, capacity building support, and policy advice to a series of ensuing projects in \nthe agriculture, natural resources, and rural development (ANR) sector in Tajikistan. The ANR \nsector plays an important role in ensuring sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the \ncountry. It has a high priority in the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan \n2030.1 The transaction TA facility will contribute to a strategically aligned and climate adaptive \ninvestment  pipeline.  The  ensuing  proposed  projects  comprise  the  Rural  Productivity \nEnhancement Sector Project and the Climate Change Adaptation Project. To enhance project \nreadiness of the ensuing proposed projects, the transaction TA facility will be complemented by \nproject readiness financing (PRF).2  \n \na.  Background \n \n2.    Agriculture\u2019s relevance to the economy. Since 2010, Tajikistan\u2019s agriculture sector \nexperienced volatile but strong average growth rates of about 6% each year. It accounts for more \nthan half of the country\u2019s total employment and contributed around 22% to the gross domestic \nproduct in 2019.3 About 70% (over 6.5 million) of the Tajik population (9.5 million) lives in rural \nareas where small-scale household farming is the major source of household incomes. Cotton \nand wheat are the primary crops that are planted on nearly three quarters of the entire cultivated \narea of Tajikistan (which is 700,000 hectares). \n \n3.         Persistent rural poverty. The proportion of the population living below the national poverty \nline decreased from 34% in 2013 to 26% in 2019. There is a wide urban-rural divide in poverty \nlevels. While urban poverty declined from 22% to 18%, rural poverty remained at very high levels \nof 30% between 2018 and 2019.4 The average national progress in poverty reduction is impacted \nby the coronavirus disease pandemic. Poverty reduction rates are expected to decelerate, \ndisproportionately affecting low-income and rural communities.  \n \n4.         Remaining food security and nutrition challenges. The country is highly vulnerable to \nfood insecurity and malnutrition. The prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity was about \n30% in 2019.5 Because of the coronavirus disease pandemic, the food security situation has since \nworsened. Over 40% of the population is experiencing very high rates of food insecurity.6 \n \nb.  Sector Challenges \n \n5.       Vulnerability to climate change and natural hazards. Climate change impacts and \nnatural hazards are the main challenges for the country\u2019s vulnerable agriculture sector. Climate \nchange models suggest a significant rise in the annual probability of droughts, increasing from \n3% to over 25% till mid-century.7 Droughts, in combination with heat stress and the increased \n \n1  Republic of Tajikistan. 2016.

", "2 \n \nwater demand for key crops, will further reduce agricultural yields. These could result in a \ndeterioration of the already fragile food and nutrition security situation. The frequency of heat days \nabove 40\u00b0 Celsius is expected to rise with associated increases in gastrointestinal infection rates \nin both humans and livestock. Increases in water and foodborne diseases are also likely. \n \n6.        Variations in snowfall and air temperature will impact rivers supplying water for agriculture \nand add to the water competition with other sectors. Changes in river flow regimes will lead to \nless water being available during the period of highest crop water demand, thus, impacting \nirrigation. This will result in decreased crop and livestock productivity, if left unmanaged.8  \n \n7.         Tajikistan is also highly vulnerable to natural hazards, including earthquakes, flash floods, \nand landslides. The challenges are amplified by a lack of awareness, knowledge, and capacity \namong communities and government institutions to adopt risk mitigation measures. This places \nsustainable development of rural agricultural areas at risk.9 Poor pasture management and \novergrazing leads to soil degradation and the general deterioration of watershed areas. The latter \ncontributes to an increased risk of landslides and mud flows. \n \n8.       Inefficient water resources management. More than 90% of agriculture production comes \nfrom irrigated lands but irrigation efficiency in the country remains critically low at 30%. Low \nproductivity exacerbates food insecurity and places additional stress on finite water resources.10 \nAbout 40% of the irrigated area has pumped water supply with associated high energy costs.11  \n \n    c.  Opportunities \n \n9.          The TA facility will provide an opportunity for strategic investment planning in the Pyanj \nriver basin and will build on the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) ongoing activities.12 ADB has \nbeen active in the Pyanj river basin since 2007 and has provided support to (i) strengthen the \nclimate  resilience  of  irrigation  and  water  supply  infrastructure;  (ii)  enable  the  Agency  for \nHydrometeorology to produce timely and accurate forecasting of weather events; and (iii) develop \nthe  Pyanj  River  Basin  Management  Plan  (PRBMP).13  This  supports  the  future  planning, \ndevelopment, and sustainable management of water resources within the basin. The TA facility \nwill augment the PRBMP by adding climate risk considerations and by identifying opportunities \nfor downscaling climate impacts on local levels within the river basin. \n \n10.   The TA facility will enable an integrated approach to natural resources management in the \nPyanj river basin, with consideration for potential climate adaptive interventions. Upstream climate \nanalysis will enhance the understanding of climate impacts on rural livelihoods, especially on \nwomen and marginalized groups. It will also identify areas within the basin with the highest \nexposure to climate change and prioritize actions to build more resilient communities. The ensuing \nprojects under the TA facility aim to be climate adaptation projects and will address climate risks \nas one of their primary objectives (Type II projects).14 \n \n8  World Bank. 2020.

", "3 \n \n11.  The TA facility and the ensuing projects will foster gender equality. Tajikistan ranks 123rd \nout  of  148  countries  on  the  global  gender  gap  index,  scoring  low  on  women\u2019s  economic \nparticipation and political empowerment.15 Women do not have equal access to knowledge, land, \nand inputs for improved agricultural productivity. The TA facility and its ensuing projects will \nimprove the role, financial empowerment, and capacity of women in the ANR sector.  \n \n12.   The TA facility will also promote digitalization and the use of advanced technologies.16 \nThis will strengthen data and information availability for decision making, and for climate risk and \nvulnerability assessments. A needs assessment and feasibility study will be developed focusing \non a digital system to improve watershed management. It will focus on livestock, specifically \nanimal registration, including tagging with microchips. Such a system will allow the Ministry of \nAgriculture to have a better understanding of the type and number of livestock in the basin, \nownership  (including  sex-disaggregated  data)  and  for  undertaking  genetic  surveillance  of \nlivestock.  \n \n13.  The TA facility will support ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priorities by (i) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (iv)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security;  and  (v) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity.17  \n \n14.  The TA facility is aligned with government priorities, specifically in terms of a coordinated \neffort to holistically address climate change in agriculture and water resources management. The \nGovernment of Tajikistan highlights the importance of the reduction of climate change vulnerability \nthrough an integrated sector approach in its Nationally Determined Contributions. It promotes \nsustainable forms of agriculture considering climate change in its National Action Plan for Climate \nChange Mitigation while its National Water Sector Reform Program 2016\u20132025 emphasizes the \nimportance of social, economic, and environmental interests. 18  \n \n15.  Lessons learned. A comprehensive approach is required in supporting project processing \nand implementation to effectively address climate change impacts on the ANR sector. This \nincludes identifying suitable interventions which can better respond to the sectors\u2019 challenges \nwithin the context of climate change. Using a TA facility, instead of single project TAs, can support \na  more  consistent  and  holistic  approach  across  the  project  portfolio  and  can  be  more \nadministratively efficient. ADB\u2019s ANR portfolio has suffered from low project readiness, delays in \ncontract awards and disbursements, and time overruns. It is also characterized by mainly stand- \nalone investments, rather than strategic and efficient lending modalities. The TA facility will \nconsider suitable options for a more efficient delivery of ANR sector investments. \n \nB.   Outputs and Activities \n \n16.

The activities will include upstream climate change assessments and \nvulnerability mapping for better targeted project activities that go beyond climate proofing of \ninfrastructure and increase focus on building climate-resilient livelihoods. Specific studies and \nconsultations will focus on the impact of climate change on women, marginalized groups, and \nlocal agricultural production systems. \n \n17.  Output 2: Climate-resilient agriculture, natural resources, and rural development \ninvestment projects prepared. The TA facility will assist the government in preparing investment \nprojects for ADB financing that have climate adaptation as one of their main priorities. The output \nfocuses on due diligence assessments such as (i) technical suitability; (ii) economic and financial \nviability; (iii) governance; (iv) poverty impact and social and gender development; (v) financial and \nprocurement risk assessment; and (v) social and environmental safeguards. During the TA \nfacility\u2019s implementation, lessons learned from previous projects will be incorporated into the \npreparation of new projects.19 \n \n18.  Output 3: Capacity building and advisory support provided. The TA facility will \nprovide the government with (i) project preparation and implementation support; (ii) capacity \ndevelopment in procurement, financial management and disbursement, safeguards, gender \nmainstreaming and project related technical aspects; (iii) policy advisory and sector assessments, \nand (iv) capacity development for adaptation planning on different government levels.  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($700,000 TASF 7 and $300,000 \nTASF-other sources), and (ii) $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change \nFund.  The  key  expenditure  items  are  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  communication \nfacilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Outputs 1 and 3 activities may commence upon approval of the TA facility. Output 2 \nactivities will start after ADB approves the project concept paper of the first ensuing project \ncovered by the TA facility. The TA facility will be implemented over three years, commencing in \nNovember 2021. \n \n21.  ADB will administer the TA, working closely with the designated counterparts.20 The \nEnvironment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation and will select, administer, and \nsupervise the consultants\u2019 outputs. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the \ntable. \n \n \n \n \n19 PRF will enhance project readiness and supplement Output 2 activities by focusing on the development of detailed \nengineering designs and project location-based climate assessments, among other things. \n20 Agencies include the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, the Committee for \nEnvironmental Protection and the Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation.
