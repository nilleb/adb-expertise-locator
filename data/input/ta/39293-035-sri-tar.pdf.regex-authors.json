INTRODUCTION \n1.  Human capital development (HCD) is a critical priority for positioning Sri Lanka as a \ncompetitive economy and society based on knowledge and innovation. Sustainable growth is \npossible  if  based  on  strong  education,  skills  development,  and  research.  During  country \nprogramming discussions in May\u2013August 2012, and during special consultation missions for \nhuman development, the government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support a \ncoordinated effort to improve the planning and implementation of various HCD programs in the \nlong-term perspective. Accordingly, a proposed multitranche financing facility for the Human \nCapital Development Investment Program is being prepared to build human capital, through \nimproved learning and employability of school-leavers and graduates, and strengthen research \nand innovation for productivity.  \n \n2.  This $1.5 million capacity development technical assistance (TA) for Human Capital \nDevelopment  Capacity  and  Implementation  Support  was  included  in  the  2012  nonlending \nprogram for Sri Lanka.1 The proposed TA aims to improve results-oriented planning based on \nmedium-term expenditure frameworks and increase and rationalize investments in HCD in Sri \nLanka.  The  government  concurs  with  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference. 2  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Sri Lanka is on a trajectory in terms of HCD that is unique in South Asia. As a middle-\nincome country emerging from a long conflict, it aims to become a competitive, knowledge-\nbased,  and  innovative  economy,  as  emphasized  in  its  long-term  national  vision,  Mahinda \nChintana.3 The government recognizes that high-quality human capital is key to achieving this \nlong-term vision. Sri Lanka has made commendable gains in basic education since the 1970s, \nhaving  achieved  99%  (effectively  universal)  primary  net  enrollment  with  gender  parity.  Sri \nLanka\u201fs average school attainment of around 10 years is much higher than the South Asian \naverage of 6 years, and Sri Lanka fares well on several global competitiveness indicators \ncompared to its other South Asian counterparts.4    \n \n4.  However, the quality of secondary education is a concern, as weak learning outcomes \ncontribute to low rates of secondary school completion. While participation in senior secondary \neducation  has  steadily  improved,  it  is  still  only  at  65%.  This  is  largely  attributable  to  low \ncompletion rates at grades 11 and 13 and low passing rates for the General Certificate of \nEducation in ordinary and advanced levels, with only half of students passing the ordinary level \nexamination  and  60%  passing  the  advanced  level  exam.  At  both  levels,  pass  rates  are \nsignificantly lower in the science, mathematics, and english subject streams than in the arts and \ncommerce, reflecting poor performance in subjects that are essential for preparing Sri Lankan \ngraduates for a knowledge-based economy.5 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Ministry of Education. Sri Lanka Education Information 2010.  \nhttp://www.moe.gov.lk/web/images/stories/statistic/sri_lanka_education_information_2010.pdf  \n ", "2 \n \n5.  This situation is further exacerbated by limited opportunity for tertiary education and \nweak  transitions  and  pathways  from  secondary  education  to  skills  training.  In  2011,  only \n142,000 students, or 41% of the 345,000 students enrolled in the school system, successfully \ncompleted their advanced level exams and so qualified to compete for university admission.6 \nRestricted capacity in tertiary education means only 22,000, or 6% of this cohort, was able to \nenter university in Sri Lanka, and a further 8,500, or 2%, went to study overseas. This left \n314,500 students who had acquired basic education up to high school and were available to \nenroll in skills programs or enter the job market. With capacity in the skills training system \ncurrently limited to only 200,000,7 many young people are entering the job market without \nsubstantial  employment  skills.  In  sum,  gains  in  basic  education  are  not  translating  into \ncomparable outcomes at the postsecondary level, and the skills-development system does not \naddress  the  needs  of  the  growing  economy.  The  demand  for  skills  in  growth  sectors  is \nincreasing,  and  employers  are  beginning  to  experience  significant  shortages.  The  current \ntechnical education and vocational training (TVET) system does not respond quickly to labor \nmarket challenges, and the supply and demand are mismatched.  \n \n6.  To  address  graduates  and  school-leavers  being  insufficiently  prepared  to  enter  the \nworkforce, and to build on gains in basic education, Sri Lanka aims to ensure equitable access \nto  high-quality  and  relevant  secondary  education  and  demand-driven  skills  training.  It \nemphasizes science and technology as key to socioeconomic transformation, which starts with \na solid foundation in science education. Guided by this long-term vision, the Government of Sri \nLanka has developed several policy frameworks and strategies to address the HCD challenge, \nincluding (i) its National Human Resources and Employment Policy;8 (ii) its Education Sector \nDevelopment  Framework  and  Program,  2012\u20132016;9 (iii)  A  Road  Map  for  Technical  and \nVocational Education and Training;10 and (iv) its Science, Technology, and Innovation Strategy \nfor Sri Lanka, 2011\u20132015.11  \n \n7.  Implementing  these  policies  and  strategies  requires  coordinated  effort  and  solid \ntechnical capacity to effectively plan, design, and implement a wide range of initiatives and \ngovernment programs for secondary and postsecondary education, including skills training. \nWhile government agencies have led efforts to prepare medium-term expenditure program \nframeworks in school education and vocational skills training, a much stronger effort to link \nsectoral programs with national planning is necessary to ensure that individual sector results \ncontribute  to  the  outcome  of  a  stronger  workforce  that  supports  national  economic  goals. \nFurther,  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and  procurement  capacities  and  monitoring \nsystems need to be strengthened to improve program efficiency. A focus on quality, effective \nimplementation, and results; expanded private sector participation to ensure relevance; and \nsynergy among sectors will drive a paradigm shift in HCD. This paradigm shift will be stimulated \nby a coordinated effort that enables sector-specific achievements to be linked more closely to \nthe growth agenda and help transform Sri Lanka into a competitive, knowledge-based economy.  \n \n                                                \n6  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Education. 2011.

In response to the government, ADB will take a longer-term approach to supporting HCD. \nIt will make secondary education and skills training more competitive and responsive to the \nneeds of industry and economy, with a greater focus on research and education to create a \nknowledge-based economy. The government has a strong vision but requires ADB to add value \nin terms of innovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected \nareas. As achieving HCD outcomes requires long-term commitment, ADB will adopt a phased, \nsector-wide approach over a long period to finance the government\u201fs programs in education, \nskills development, and research and innovation.  The TA will support and augment capacities \nto better plan, implement and monitor these programs in the human development sectors.  The \nTA will also draw upon the findings of recent analytical work conducted in the area of higher \neducation and TVET,12 and from lessons of past and ongoing project experience.   \n \n9.  While long-term multi-sectoral financing of an HCD Investment Program will enable ADB \nto  support  and  strengthen  policy  frameworks  founded  on  sound  strategy  and  backed  by \ngovernment financing, it will challenge the capacity of various implementing agencies to develop, \nplan, implement, and systemically monitor their medium-term sector expenditure frameworks \nand achievement of results, as well as strain PFM and procurement capacity. The TA will \nstrengthen capacity to support and work closely with the line ministries\u201f sector programs. It will \nalign with the HCD Investment Program and support the country\u201fs HCD needs in secondary and \npostsecondary education, including TVET, and toward system innovation, promoting growth that \nis socially and gender inclusive. The TA will respond to the government\u201fs request that ADB \nsupport be longer term and more flexible, with lower transaction costs. It will improve efficiency \nby reducing staff resources devoted in processing and administration and by sharing consultant \ninputs across subsectors.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be enhanced human capital in Sri Lanka toward a productive knowledge-\nbased economy. \n \n11.  The outcome will be enhanced government capacity to plan, coordinate, and implement \nresults-oriented human capital development, with greater synergies across subsectors. The TA \nwill help the National Planning Department and other government agencies to ensure that \nensuing  sector  plans  are  technically  sound,  results-oriented,  and  based  on  stakeholder \nconsensus;  have  appropriate  implementation  arrangements,  including  plans  for  sustainable \nlong-term  financing;  and  have  built-in  plans  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment. \n \n12.  The outputs are as follows: \n(i)  Improved  policy  and  technical  capacity  for  planning  human  capital \ndevelopment sector programs. This output aims to provide substantive policy \nadvice on such technical areas of secondary education reform as curriculum \nreview, teacher training, and assessment reform; the TVET areas of financing \nskills  training  including  an  expanded  role  for  the  private  sector,  skills  for \ndisadvantaged groups, and overseas labor markets; and technologies relevant to \npriority  industries,  industry  partnerships  for  research  and  development,  and \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for the Development Partnership Program for South Asia. Manila.  \n \n ", "4 \n \nestablishing science parks. It will also build technical capacity to implement policy \non education, skills training, and research.  \n(ii)  Strengthened institutional and fiduciary capacity for planning, coordinating, \nand implementing human capital development sector programs. The TA will \nhelp implementing agencies prepare and implement medium-term sector plans \nand  sector-wide  approaches;  improve  systems  and  capacity  in  PFM, \nprocurement,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  and  strengthen  systems  for \nimplementing and monitoring results. \n(iii)  Research on human capital development programs to guide better design. \nThe TA will provide resources to identify new HCD initiatives; conduct action-\noriented research; and mount small pilot projects for replication through larger \ninvestments in new and ongoing projects, feasibility studies, and due diligence.  \n \n13.  These outputs will support the efficient implementation of programs, including those \nsupported by ADB loans; and the design of new projects and programs that align with the \nhuman capital development objectives and strategies of Sri Lanka. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will improve the design, preparation, and quality of HCD programs through \nanalyses of salary reform, expanded public\u2013private partnerships (PPP), expenditures, and how \nto improve the policy and technical capacity of line ministries. It will strengthen capacity for \nplanning and implementation, focusing on fiduciary and monitoring aspects. It will conduct (i) \nfiduciary assessments of HCD subsectors, (ii) institutional assessments of line ministries, (iii) \nquarterly monitoring of sector results indicators, (iv) two third-party validation reports, (v) hands-\non workshops and field interviews that are socially and gender inclusive, (vi) training on sector \nplans  and  expenditure  management;  (vii)  in-depth  sector  assessments  and  research;  (viii) \ntargeted studies in areas linked to improving and expanding education and skills training; and \n(ix) feasibility studies and research on new program development for science and innovation.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.7 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u201fs Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources: $1 million; TASF-IV: \n$500,000). The government will provide in-kind support such as counterpart staff and office \nspace. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA executing agency is the National Planning Department (NPD) under the Ministry \nof  Finance  and  Planning.  The  implementing  agencies  are  the  Ministry  of  Education  for \nsecondary education, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development for skills training, Ministry \nfor Research and Technology, and any other designated agency. A TA steering committee \ncomprised of secretaries of the implementing agencies will guide and direct the TA, conducting \nregular consultative meetings with all stakeholder agencies. Three working groups will help NPD \ncoordinate  TA  activities  by  developing  annual  and  quarterly  work  plans,  monitoring \nimplementation progress, and guiding consultant teams for specific subsectors. The steering \ncommittee will meet two times a year. The working groups will meet quarterly and on request by \nany member or ADB. The working groups will be assisted by a team of consultants. The joint \nsecretary of NPD will lead a secretariat with the assistance of consultants. NPD has dedicated \n ", "  5 \nstaff for overseeing various subsectors, who will be supported by the human development \neconomist and team leader engaged under the TA.   \n \n17.  The TA will be conducted over 24 months from the fielding of consultants, which is \nanticipated  in  January  2013,  placing  completion  in  December  2014.  The  TA  will  engage \nconsultants  to  provide  130  person-months  of  inputs:  22  person-months  of  international \nconsultancy and 80 person-months of national consultancy to be engaged through firms, and 28 \nperson-months of pool consultancy (10 international and 18 national). The terms of reference \nwill reflect the requirements of the executing and implementing agencies, subject to ADB review \nand agreement. ADB will engage consulting firms using quality- and cost-based selection with a \nquality-to-cost ratio of 80:20 and simplified technical proposals. It will engage individual experts \nby single source selection in accordance with ADB\u201fs Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). All TA-financed goods will be procured in line with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA \nwill accord with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Indicative consultant requirements and terms of reference are in Appendix 3.13  \n \n18.  The expected outputs of the TA will be disseminated twice a year at a consultative \nmeeting called by the Ministry of Finance and Planning and will be linked closely to the planning \nand budget preparation cycle. The findings of specific studies, assessments, and reports will be \nshared at appropriate forums and disseminated widely to subsector staff in line ministries and \nimplementing agencies. The TA will guide country and sector dialogue, and findings will be \nshared with the country economic and operational team. A final workshop will be conducted at \nthe end of TA implementation to assess lessons, findings, and recommendations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for Human Capital Development Capacity and Implementation \nSupport, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n13 The terms of reference in this report will be revised in consultation with the executing and implementing agencies at \nthe inception stage, including the requirement for packaging contracts.
