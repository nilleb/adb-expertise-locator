The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched the Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI) in \nJuly 2005 to expand its operations in clean energy1 to $1 billion a year. The EEI is being \nimplemented  in  three  phases:  (i)  phase  I  (June  2005\u2013June  2006)  concluded  with  ADB \nManagement  endorsement  of  a  draft  EEI  report  that  firmly  established  the  rationale  for \nexpanded  and  sustained  ADB  action  and  clean  energy  investment,  defined  the  general \nprinciples  of  the  clean  energy  investment  and  action  plan,  and  provided  priorities  and  a \nframework for next steps; (ii) phase II (June 2006\u2013April 2009) is currently being implemented to \nformulate country and regional strategies and action plans on reaching EEI targets; strengthen \nADB\u2019s institutional capacity for scaling up, monitoring, and evaluating activities under the EEI; \nand  establish  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility;  and  \n(iii) phase III (2008\u20132010) will implement the strategies and action plans, and include expanded \nefforts to widen the reach of EEI activities beyond the phase II scope. \n \n2.  Two regional technical assistance (RETA) projects totaling $2.9 million in funding were \napproved to support phase II. The initial RETA2 was approved on 2 October 2006 for $600,000 \nto carry out inception work, such as the prioritization of developing member countries (DMCs) \nfor inclusion in EEI phase II activities and the holding of consultative workshops to identify \nsectors with the highest clean energy investment potential in each DMC. A successor RETA3 \nwas approved on 30 March 2007 for $2.3 million to develop detailed country action plans, as \nwell as to build ADB\u2019s internal capacity to implement clean energy projects and to support \nestablishment of the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The proposed RETA4 will \nexpand the operations of EEI through its phase III. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While climate change is a global challenge, the case for action is particularly strong in \nthe Asia and Pacific region. The region is home to more than half of the world\u2019s poor, who will \nsuffer the most from the adverse impacts of climate change. Moreover, as a consequence of \nrapid and carbon-intensive economic growth, the region is fast becoming a major source of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Today, developing Asia accounts for 29% of global energy-related \ncarbon dioxide emissions, three times more than its share 30 years ago. This current share will \ngrow to a hefty 42% by 2030. If deforestation and emissions from landfills and industrial sources \nare considered, the region will contribute even more. Unless current development patterns \nchange,  the  region  will  find  itself  increasingly  straining  the  environment,  with  negative \nconsequences to the region\u2019s future well-being and that of the rest of the world. ADB\u2019s DMCs \nare  becoming  increasingly  more  concerned  about  the  threats  of  climate  change,  and  are \nresponding with strategies and programs for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The \nrequirements are clear: deployment of low-carbon and efficient technologies, pricing of carbon \nemissions, appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks, sustainable land use, climate-resilient \n                                                 \n1  Clean energy is taken to cover energy efficiency (supply-side and end-use), renewable energy, and clean fuel \n(clean coal and cleaner fossil fuels) technology applications. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  the  Implementation  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  in \nDeveloping Member Countries. Manila (TA 6392-REG). \n4  The vice-president, knowledge management and sustainable development approved the concept paper for the \nRETA on 9 July 2007. The RETA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on  \n14 January 2008. \n ", "2   \ninfrastructure, disaster preparedness, and a range of additional adaptation measures. All of \nthese will demand large financial resources, and a collective and concerted response from \ngovernments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector.  \n \n4.  Rising to the challenge, ADB established the Clean Energy and Environment Program to \nhelp fill financing and knowledge gaps, and foster partnerships. The program, which is being \nintegrated into ADB\u2019s broader Climate Change Program, is aligned with the clean energy and \ninvestment framework for multilateral development banks and introduces innovative approaches \nthrough its clean energy subprograms, such as EEI, to expand ADB\u2019s energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy portfolio to $1 billion a year. ADB also promotes sustainable and energy-\nefficient modes of transportation.  \n \n5.  Under the EEI, ADB identified the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, \nPhilippines,  and  Viet  Nam  as  priority  DMCs  with  the  highest  potential  for  clean  energy \ninvestments  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  From  December  2006  to  October  2007,  ADB \nconducted consultative meetings in these countries to learn firsthand from clean energy market \nstakeholders of the barriers, catalyzing conditions, and immediate investment  opportunities \nprevailing in each DMC market as a prerequisite step to local clean energy project pipeline \ndevelopment. Work under the earlier EEI phase II RETAs confirmed that the energy efficiency \nmarkets in the priority DMCs are huge and remain largely untapped. The following are the \nenergy efficiency investment scale-up opportunities in these country markets: \n \n(i)  People\u2019s Republic of China. To meet its long-term national development targets, the \ncountry needs to raise about $130 billion in energy efficiency project financing by 2010, \nand an estimated $300 billion in renewable energy investments by 2020. The Government \nsees the need for innovative mechanisms and measures to effectively utilize external \nassistance (foreign capital) in scaling up energy efficiency and renewable energy project \nimplementation. \n(ii)  India. The country faced energy and peak shortages of 8.3% in 2005 and 12.3% in 2006. \nEnergy  demand  is  estimated  to  increase  by  35.6%  in  2011/12  from  2006/07.  The \nGovernment\u2019s target of achieving 100% village electrification by providing power to all by \n2012 will push this demand further. The potential for energy efficiency investments is huge \nin  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  municipal  corporations,  small  commercial \nbuildings, and the residential sector. \n(iii)  Indonesia.  A  2006  presidential  instruction  mandates  energy  conservation  to  reduce \nenergy elasticity to <1 by 2025. Clearer estimates exist for new clean coal, micro-hydro, \nbiomass, and biofuel generation capacity. End-use energy efficiency programs involving \nenergy  service  companies,  compact  fluorescent  lamps,  and  other  demand-side \nmanagement practices are being considered. \n(iv)  Pakistan. The country experienced suffered serious peak electricity supply shortfalls of \n1,500\u20132,000 megawatts (MW) in the summer of 2007. Current projections of national \neconomic growth in excess of 8% will accelerate growth in energy demand. An estimated \n$150 billion will have to be raised to install an additional 143,310 MW of new generating \ncapacity  through  2030.  Pakistan  will  require  an  estimated  \n$2.2  billion  in  renewable  energy  investments  to  meet  its  2015  renewable  energy \ndevelopment target. \n(v)  The Philippines. The country will need to fill more than 6,700 MW of power supply deficits \nfrom 2008 to 2013. The Government created the Presidential Task Force on Climate \nChange in February 2007; the Department of Energy leads climate change mitigation \n ", "  3\nefforts. Some 1,000 MW of virtual generating capacities can be created through various \ndemand-side and supply-side energy efficiency measures (including compact fluorescent \nlamp programs). \n(vi)  Viet Nam. The country requires an estimated $4 billion per year in new energy sector \ninvestments  to  sustain  economic  growth,  which  hovers  at  7%\u20138%  per  year.  The \nGovernment launched an 11-component, 10-year national targeted program on energy \nefficiency and conservation to reduce energy consumption by 2015. The energy market \nhas potential capacity for 2,450 MW of compact fluorescent lamp virtual power, 500 MW of \nwind power, and 405 MW of biomass power plant . \n \n6.  Building on the success of the earlier EEI RETAs, the campaign to radically scale-up \nclean energy investments has to be sustained through phase III (2008\u20132010). The urgency for \nsustained RETA support is characterized by two fundamental needs: (i) ADB needs to assess \nthe energy efficiency market potential in smaller DMCs, especially those eligible for Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  assistance;  and  (ii)  the  operations  departments5 will  require  technical \nsupport for preparing and tracking energy efficiency investments in the six next priority DMCs. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  This RETA will help decrease the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy \nsecurity in selected DMCs in the Asia and Pacific region through greater use of clean energy. \nThe outcome will be an expansion of ADB clean energy loan and technical assistance (TA) \noperations to cover DMCs that were not prioritized under the EEI phase II. The RETA design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Activities will focus on investigating energy efficiency market opportunities in six new \nDMCs that the operations departments believe possess a significant potential for clean energy \ninvestments but were not included among the six initial priority DMCs during the EEI phase II. \nThe  RETA  resources  will  be  utilized  to  develop  clean  energy  markets  in  Afghanistan, \nBangladesh,  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Mongolia,  and  Uzbekistan,6 \nincluding the identification of a pipeline of projects for possible ADB financing. The RETA \nactivities will be implemented in three components. Component 1 activities will include any or all \nof the following: \n(i)   Identify a RETA implementing agency in each new DMC. \n(ii)  Recruit  and  manage  consultants  to  support  enabling  policy  and  market \ninterventions, and develop country action plans and a pipeline of projects for \nADB consideration in close coordination with the DMC implementing agencies \nconcerned. \n                                                 \n5  In the context of the RETA, ADB\u2019s operations departments refer to the Private Sector Operations Department and \nthe energy and infrastructure, transport, and urban development divisions of ADB\u2019s regional departments. \n6  ADB\u2019s operations departments identified the six next priority DMCs, which were approved by the Clean Energy \nWorking Group on 30 June 2008. Should budgetary resources allow, additional DMCs (such as Sri Lanka and \nTajikistan) may be covered under this RETA. \n ", "4   \n(iii)   Conduct national consultative workshops to identify barriers and opportunities in \nthe local energy efficiency markets, and introduce country action plans and the \ninitial pipeline of projects and/or outputs of applicable interventions. \n(iv)   Support enabling policy and financial interventions, where applicable. \n(v)  Gather updated information on new and innovative clean energy technologies, \ninvestment models, and international best practices. \n(vi)  Assist in developing new clean energy investments in the DMCs, and especially \naggregating end-use energy efficiency improvement projects. \n(vii)  Assist in identifying clean energy development potential in nonenergy sectors in \nthe DMCs (e.g., water and sanitation sector). \n \n9.  Component  2  will  use  knowledge  products  and  knowledge-sharing  platforms  as  a \nregional strategy to catalyze DMC action toward clean energy investment-building. It will support \nregional  knowledge-sharing  activities  such  as  (i)  international  and  regional  fora,  seminars, \nworkshops, conferences, study tours, and similar events intended to share knowledge and \nexperience on energy efficiency and other clean energy scale-up solutions among DMCs; and, \n(ii) internal meetings, seminars, workshops, and newsletters to share innovative approaches in \ndeveloping energy efficiency projects among ADB\u2019s operations departments.  \n  \n10.  Component 3 will continue to support ADB operations by maintaining in-house expertise \nin the planning, design, monitoring, and tracking of clean energy projects. It will include the \nfollowing activities:   \n \n(i)  Maintain a full-time EEI team of experts to (a) assist the Energy Community of \nPractice  by  facilitating  the  internal  exchange  of  lessons,  experience,  and \nknowledge  products  among  the  operations  departments;  (b)  coordinate  all \nactivities, funded under the RETA, of the operations departments, consultants, \nimplementing agencies, and other DMC stakeholders; (c) coordinate with ADB\u2019s \nclean energy working group and other teams implementing other clean energy \ninitiatives under the Climate Change Program; (d) provide follow-through TA to \nthe operations departments for sustaining activities (e.g., capacity building, policy \nand regulatory reforms, project pipeline development) in the initial priority DMCs; \n(e) gather updated information on new and innovative clean energy technologies, \ninvestment models, and international best practices; and (f) support secretariat \noperations of the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and the Climate \nChange Fund. \n(ii)  Implement project development, and a monitoring and evaluation system for \nclean energy projects, including (a) update a clean energy investment baseline to \ninclude  clean  energy  components  of  approved  2008  projects,  (b)  identify \nopportunities to improve the monitoring and tracking framework to accurately \npredict pipeline projects, and (c) develop a simplified methodology for estimating \nthe carbon footprint of ADB loan and TA operations. \n(iii)  Support development of clean energy projects in energy and nonenergy divisions \nthrough participation of staff from ADB\u2019s Energy, Transport, and Water Division \n(RSID)  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  EEI \nsecretariat consultants in project design, consultation missions, and recruitment \n ", "  5\nof  consultants  with  specific  knowledge  and  experience  of  the  technologies, \nmethodologies, and approaches being developed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $3,000,000. It will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Climate Change Fund. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for and RSID will oversee the overall administration of \nthe RETA. All activities related to country-specific TA, including the identification of a pipeline of \nprojects for possible ADB financing, will be led by the operations departments. For example, the \noperations departments and RSID will collaborate in drawing up a work plan for each new DMC, \nand  estimating  the  resources  and  consulting  services  needed  to  undertake  the  planned \nactivities. The operations departments will then oversee consultants\u2019 performance and technical \noutputs. RSID will play a supportive administrative role, including administering the contracts of \nthe  consultants  and  compiling  the  outputs  of  the  various  contracts  into  a  cohesive  set  of \ncountry-specific strategies and action plans. This is a continuation of the arrangements under \nthe first two EEI RETAs. Local counterparts will vary according to the country, sector, and \nwhether the projects are public or private. Activities funded by this RETA will only begin in a \nparticular DMC after ADB has received written confirmation from the DMC government that it \nhas no objection to its inclusion in the RETA. RSID will take the lead in (i) supporting energy \nand nonenergy divisions to implement and track clean energy projects and manage knowledge-\nsharing activities across the selected DMCs, (ii) updating the project development system,  \n(iii)  developing  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  track  clean  energy  investments,  \n(iv)  providing  EEI  secretariat  operations,  and  (v)  coordinating  all  regional  and  internal \nknowledge-sharing activities. RSID will work closely with the Energy Community of Practice and \noperations departments in carrying out these activities. \n \n13.  The RETA will be conducted from November 2008 to November 2010 (24 months). It will \nrequire an estimated 54 person-months of international consulting services and 156 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services.  The  engagement  of  consultants  will  be  phased \naccording to the sequence of activities. The international consultants will be expected to spend \nmost of their time in the field. RSID will draft detailed terms of reference in consultation with the \noperations departments for each work component. Most international consultants are expected \nto be recruited as individuals because of the need to source specialized, including country-\nspecific, expertise. Individual consultants will be engaged through either time-based or lump-\nsum contracts. If a firm must be recruited for complex jobs involving multiple types of expertise, \nthe firms will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection, quality-based selection, \nconsultants\u2019 qualifications selection, or single-source selection methods, depending on the value \nof the contract and the complexity of the assignment. Also, firms will submit either full or biodata \ntechnical proposals, and be awarded either time-based or lump-sum contracts. The recruitment \nof  consultants  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. All procurement of goods and other services under the RETA will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to time). \nUpon completion of the RETA, all equipment procured by the consultants under the RETA will \nbe turned over or disposed of in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions,  \nNo. 5.11 (January 2008, as amended from time to time).  \n \n ", "6   \n \nIV.
