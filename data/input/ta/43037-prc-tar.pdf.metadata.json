INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  the  Antipoverty  Effects  of  Social \nAssistance1 was included in the 2009 nonlending program of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) during the PRC country programming mission in December 2008. ADB undertook a \nreconnaissance mission in March 2009 and followed up with periodic discussions with the \nMinistry of Civil Affairs (MOCA), the project executing agency. Agreement was reached with the \ngovernment, including the Ministry of Finance and MOCA, on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, \ncost and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Social assistance is one of the major components of the social protection system in the \nPRC  and  a  key  to  ensuring  balanced  development  in  the  rapidly  changing  economic \nenvironment. The most important of the programs is the dibao or minimum living standards \nguarantee scheme. This social assistance scheme targets poor households with per capita \nincome below locally determined poverty or social assistance lines. Dibao is the cash transfer \nprogram  upon  which  the  others,  such  as  medical  financial  assistance  and  educational \nassistance, are built. Begun in urban areas in 1999, urban dibao has been provided universally \nsince 2002 and rural dibao since 2007. There are now 22 million\u201323 million beneficiaries of \nurban dibao. The rural dibao program has recently gone through a large expansion and has \ngrown from covering 28 million beneficiaries in 2007 to 46 million beneficiaries in 2009.  \n \n3.  Establishment and expansion of the dibao programs are significant achievements in the \nPRC\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty in the country and provide a social safety net. However, issues \nrelating to implementation, sustainability, and coverage remain important challenges. Rural \nareas of the PRC have made substantial progress in reducing poverty and since 1981 the rural \npoor population has fallen from 250 million to 14.79 million in 2007. Since the late 1990s, the \nrate of poverty reduction has slowed as certain populations, such as elderly and disabled \nhouseholds, are unable to benefit from development-based antipoverty programs that rely on \nemployability as the key feature for lifting income levels. Funding for the program is provided by \nshared  arrangements  among  local  government  administrative  levels  (provincial,  prefecture, \nmunicipal, county, township, and village collectives). Because of funding limitations at the local \nlevel since 2007, the central government has subsidized local governments, especially those in \nthe central and western regions.   \n \n4.  Both programs face particular problems in implementation, sustainability, and assuring \nfull coverage of vulnerable populations. Urban dibao faces challenges in providing adequate \nfunding, incentives for beneficiaries to graduate from the assistance, addressing child poverty, \nand integrating dibao with other social insurance benefits and labor market policies. Rural dibao \nfaces challenges in funding, targeting, and integrating the assistance with the newly introduced \nrural pension program, and medical and financial aid.   \n \n5.  This TA is designed to address some of the major policy issues identified and provide \nrecommendations for MOCA, which is responsible for the overall program of social assistance. \nThe  Department  of  Social  Assistance  (DSA)  in  MOCA  is  responsible  for  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  social  assistance  programs.  To  date,  MOCA  has  focused  its  efforts  on \nprogram promotion, guidelines, and field investigations on the performance of local programs \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 1 December 2009. \n ", "2   \nand there is a need for further policy refinement. The major policy issues identified for further \nresearch and adjustment can be grouped into three categories: (i) sustainable financing and \ninstitutional arrangements, (ii) identification and targeting of the poor, and (iii) social inclusion.  \n \n  1.  Sustainable Financing and Institutional Arrangements \n \n6.  Benefit rates and adjustment methods. Currently, benefit rates are determined by \nlocal governments, mostly using standard budgeting methods. In practice, many localities have \ndetermined benefit levels solely based on available local government income and financial \nconstraints. In most localities, benefits are provided at a flat rate to all members in a household \nwith equal shares and are usually too low to lift them out of poverty. There is a need to identify \nadequate and sustainable policies and systems for determining and adjusting benefit rates. \n \n7.  Adequate  benefit  graduation  incentives.  The  current  dibao  system  covers  a \nconsiderable proportion of the able-bodied population. MOCA has found that recipients are \nreluctant to graduate from assistance because it is associated with eligibility for related benefits \nsuch as medical and educational assistance and other preferential policies. The number of \nrecipients exiting benefits has been negligible and there is a need for policy improvement in this \narea. \n \n8.  Performance  assessment. To date, little attention has been given to performance \nassessment, either from the perspective of internal efficiency of the system or from the impact at \nthe household level. There is a need to determine appropriate policies and methods for both. \n \n  2.  Identification and Targeting of the Poor \n \n9.  Targeting  methods.  Local  governments  rely  on  means-testing  plus  community \nscreening to select poor households based on the local poverty line. Measuring household \nincomes  has  proven  to  be  a  difficult  task  for  administrators  with  high  costs  and  frequent \ncomplaints from applicants over targeting errors. To avoid such problems, local civil affairs rely \nextensively  on  community-based  screening  for  selecting  potential  beneficiaries.  Efforts  by \nMOCA  to  ensure  transparency  in  this  process  have  yielded  results,  but  it  is  clear  that \noverreliance on this methodology is not a long-term solution. There is a need to refine targeting \nmethodologies and establish clear policies. \n \n10.  Marginal poor. Eligibility for dibao provides access to other subsidies such as education \nassistance and medical financial assistance. For households that are just above the poverty \nlevel and therefore eligible for dibao, the inability to access the other benefits may actually mean \nthat they fall below the consumption levels of dibao beneficiaries. This issue has been raised by \nseveral studies and there is an urgent need for investigation and policy recommendations on \nspecific criteria and benefits for the marginal poor.  \n \n  3.  Social Inclusion \n \n11.  Child poverty. A neglected issue in the PRC, child poverty has only begun to receive \nattention from the government recently. The World Bank assessment of poverty and inequality \nfound that children, particularly girls, are more likely to be poor than the elderly.2 Increased \nvulnerability and risks for children have been recognized such as child trafficking, street children, \n                                                 \n2  World  Bank.  2009.

There is a need for the dibao system to consider the special needs of children in \npolicy design and to coordinate work with stakeholders such as the State Council Leading \nGroup  Office  of  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF), and Plan International. \n \n12.  Links to related ADB technical assistance. The TA is directly linked to the PRC \ncountry partnership strategy (2008\u20132010), which places emphasis on inclusive growth and \nbalanced development.4 The TA builds on findings and partnerships established in the ADB TA \nfor  Facility  for  Policy  Reform  and  Poverty  Reduction  (subproject  1.4),  which  focused  on \noperational  mechanisms  for  rural  dibao  and  medical  financial  assistance.5 The  TA  will  be \nconducted in collaboration with the subproject on application of international best practices of \nsocial welfare reforms to social assistance policy in the PRC, which is being funded under ADB \nTA for Facility for Policy Reform and Capacity Building III.6 It will also seek to share findings and \nrecommendations with ADB TA for Rural Pension Reform and Development.7 The TA will \nexpand on these previous and current research efforts, and provide policy recommendations to \nstrengthen the antipoverty functions of social assistance programs in the PRC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n13.  The TA will build on the results of ADB-funded TA (footnote 5), which was carried out by \nMOCA in 2008 and led to the design of specific guidelines for improving rural social assistance \nprograms. This current TA will strengthen the antipoverty functions of the social assistance \nprograms in the PRC. This will be achieved through (i) case studies on current programs of \nselected counties or cities on sustainable financing, institutional arrangements, identification and \ntargeting of the poor; and (ii) survey research on child poverty in select counties and cities. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the TA will be strengthened antipoverty functions of social assistance \nprograms in the PRC. The outcome of the TA will be the policy recommendations proposed by \nMOCA adopted by the State Council. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA outputs will be (i) policy or implementation recommendations on measures and \nmechanisms  for  improving  social  assistance  in  the  PRC,  and  (ii)  widely  disseminated \npublications on key TA findings and recommendations. The recommendations will be drawn \nfrom the analysis and assessment of issues covering (i) sustainable financing and institutional \narrangements, (ii) identification and targeting of the poor, and (iii) social inclusion. Three reports \nwill be produced on the key issues of findings from the case studies in select areas and the \nsurvey analysis and findings on social inclusion and child poverty. A policy note for decision \n                                                 \n3   Left-behind children refers to children of urban migrants who have been left behind in rural areas, most often under \nthe care of relatives. \n4  ADB. 2008.

A final report will bring all of the outputs together \nand provide an executive summary of the TA findings. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over an 18-month period. Phase 1 lasting \n3 months will comprise background research to (i) review current policies and strategies of \nimplementation  for  each  of  the  key  issues,  (ii)  identify  international  best  practice  options, \n(iii) outline the methodologies to be used, and (iv) select the counties and cities for conducting \nthe case studies and survey. An inception workshop will be held within the first month of the TA \nto discuss the initial sites, proposed methodologies, project teams, and anticipated outputs. \nPhase 2 will last for 12 months and will (i) undertake the case studies in selected counties and \ncities, and (ii) conduct the survey on child poverty. Technical working groups representing a \nrange of stakeholders will be organized for each of the key topics. An ADB internal review group \ncomprising  team  leaders  from  the  other  associated  TA  and  technical  experts  will  provide \nguidance and review of documentation. Phase 2 will include a series of workshops on each of \nthe topics to present findings and receive feedback, guidance, and agreement on the policy and \nimplementation recommendations. Phase 3 lasting 3 months will (i) finalize all of the reports and \npolicy  and  implementation  recommendations,  (ii)  hold  a  final  conference  on  findings  and \nrecommendations, (iii) prepare the policy note for decision makers, and (iv) disseminate the final \nreports.  \n \n17.  The  final  conference  will  invite  participants  from  relevant  local  government \nrepresentatives,  key  ministry  officials,  development  partners  and  research  organizations \noperating in the PRC, and others to share the TA findings and recommendations. A final report \nof the conference will be produced. All outputs will be provided in English and Chinese, and \ntranslation and publication costs will be included in the research costs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 equivalent, of which $350,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014others). The \ngovernment will finance the remaining $50,000 equivalent to cover the TA office and equipment \n(e.g., computers), office communications, and remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff. \nTentative cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOCA has been a partner of ADB for several ADB-funded TA projects. MOCA is an \nexperienced  and  capable  executing  agency.  DSA  has  been  the  implementing  agency  for \nprevious  ADB  TA  projects.  Detailed  institutional  assessment  will  be  conducted  during  TA \nimplementation.  DSA  will  provide  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  computers,  utilities,  and \ntelecommunication access (including broadband internet connection), materials, maps, data, \nand documents as required under the TA, and will cover the cost of office utilities for the \nconsultants. DSA will designate a TA focal point and will organize an expert steering committee \ngroup of invited national experts, who will review the inception, workshop, and final reports of \nthe consultants and will participate in the final conference. The TA consultants will incorporate \nsuggestions  of  the  expert  review  group  into  the  final  TA  reports.  DSA  will  also  organize \ninstitutional arrangements and coordinate local staff for the action research in selected counties \nand cities. \n ", "    5 \n20.  A total of 28 person-months of consulting services (two international consultants for \n3 person-months  and  three  national  consultants  for  25  person-months)  will  be  required. \nConsultants will have expertise in (i) design of social assistance programs and policies including \nbenefit rates, targeting, and monitoring and evaluation; (ii) in-depth knowledge of existing social \nassistance  programs  in  the  PRC,  institutional  frameworks,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystems; and (iii) poverty in the PRC, including issues pertaining to marginal poor and child \npoverty. Two national consultants will serve as the team leader and deputy team leader. The \nconsultants will be responsible for producing the TA\u2019s outputs and deliverables effectively and \non time, and for organizing and carrying out all TA activities including the technical working \ngroups, survey, and policy note. Technical working groups for each of the themes will be \nestablished by MOCA, with inputs from the consultants and ADB. Membership will be made up \nof relevant government ministries, local agencies, and development partners such as UNICEF, \nPlan International, and others. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will create an \ninternal review group of technical experts and team leaders responsible for TA on similar \nthemes such as rural pensions. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  In dialogue with MOCA and/or DSA, ADB will recruit individual national and international \nexperts to provide inputs as formal consultants, short-term resource persons, and task-specific \nexperts. ADB will endorse the terms of reference, including the duration and expected results. \nAll  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants will be chosen based \non their academic qualifications and relevant work experience. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8 To facilitate \nimplementation, ADB may establish an advance facility for MOCA and/or DSA as needed, \nand/or utilize direct payment (e.g., for workshop venues). \n \n22.  Dissemination of results will be key to the success of the TA. The TA results and policy \nrecommendations will be disseminated in a policy note for decision makers. In addition, reports \non each of the main issues will be prepared, discussed at the workshops, and disseminated. A \nfinal TA report with executive summary of all findings will also be prepared.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening the Antipoverty Effects of \nSocial Assistance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.
