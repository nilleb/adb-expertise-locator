INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nthe new procurement framework of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through outreach efforts, \ncapacity building, and training of executing agencies and implementing agencies in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). It will build upon the work of ADB\u2019s TA for Enhancing \nProcurement Performance of Developing Member Countries in ADB Projects,1 which supported \nthe development of the procurement policy and regulations for ADB borrowers. \n \n2.  The heads of departments endorsed this follow-up TA as corporate priority TA for 2017 \non 11 November 2016.2\n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Procurement reforms were initiated in 2014 through the midterm review action plan3 of \nStrategy 2020 to strengthen ADB\u2019s operational efficiency and effectiveness.4 This included the \nimplementation of a 10-point procurement action plan that aimed to (i) improve ADB\u2019s business \nprocesses, (ii) increase ADB responsiveness and engagement, and (iii) more effectively respond \nto evolving changes of global procurement practices. While the application of these actions \nproduced encouraging results, the overall procurement time taken by the project executing and \nimplementing agencies of DMCs and ADB still remained high, and ADB was also seen as \nemphasizing  procedural  compliance  in  a  one-size-fits-all  fashion.  Consequently,  deeper \nprocurement reforms were needed to achieve a better, faster, and more effective procurement \nsystem.  To  respond  to  such  concerns,  an  interdepartmental  procurement  reform  steering \ncommittee and several working groups were formed in early 2016 to review and suggest ways to \nfurther enhance ADB\u2019s procurement processes and procedures. A survey among ADB clients \nwas also conducted, in addition to seeking inputs from internal ADB working groups. The result \nwas a new procurement framework5 approved by the ADB Board of Directors on 12 April 2017. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s second-generation procurement reforms introduced under the new framework are \nguided by two documents: the Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers. The Procurement Policy, approved by the ADB Board of Directors, includes two new \ncore procurement principles\u2014quality and value for money\u2014in addition to economy, efficiency, \nfairness,  and  transparency.  These  principles  permit  the  introduction  of  fit-for-purpose \nprocurement methods to support, among others, procurement of high-level technologies; and, \ntogether  with  an  enhanced  complaint-handling  mechanism,  are  aimed  at  addressing \nprocurement-related  complaints  in  a  timely  manner  with  transparency  and  fairness.  The \nProcurement  Policy  also  introduces  alternative  procurement  arrangements  to  allow  the \napplication  of  the  procurement  rules  and  procedures  of  other  development  agencies  and \naccredited agencies in DMCs. The Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers approved by the \nADB  Management  contain  operational  procedures  for  ADB  borrowers  to  implement  the \nProcurement Policy. \n \n5.  When the procurement framework became effective on 1 July 2017, an implementation \naction plan was formulated to guide and help monitor the framework\u2019s rollout to executing \n \n1 ADB. 2015.

The plan identifies specific actions to be taken along with \nexecuting  agencies  and  implementing  agencies  focusing  on  three  areas  for  improvement: \nreducing total procurement time, improving quality, and developing a robust and effective delivery \nsystem. The implementation of these actions requires extensive support to ADB\u2019s DMCs to \nsuccessfully adopt and implement the new framework. Providing this support will need significant \noutreach efforts, training of executing and implementing agencies staff, as well as capacity \nbuilding throughout the implementation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: effective and sustainable execution of ADB\u2019s \nprocurement reforms through strengthened procurement capacity.6 The TA will have the following \noutcome: enhanced procurement-related decision making by DMCs.7\n \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Capacity of executing and implementing agencies to implement ADB\u2019s \nsecond-generation procurement reforms enhanced. The training programs under the TA will \nbe designed to upgrade the skills of executing and implementing agencies\u2019 staff and improve their \nunderstanding of the procurement procedures introduced by the new framework. Participants will \nbe acquainted with ADB\u2019s core procurement principles (with emphasis on value for money and \nquality), usage of open competitive bidding, identification and resolution of abnormally low bids, \napplication  of  a  standstill  period,  and  the  risk-based  oversight  function  for  the  review  of \nprocurement transactions by ADB. The training programs will also guide the attendees on the \ncomplaint-handling mechanisms; special approaches related to public\u2013private partnerships and \nfragile  or  conflict-affected  situations;  and  methods  of  adopting  and  contracting  high-level \ntechnology solutions in areas such as climate change, smart grids, renewable energy, toll or \nticketing systems, mass transit, and remote-sensing technology, to name a few.8 To the extent \npractical, training for executing and implementing agencies will be coordinated with the respective \nWorld Bank country teams and may be jointly organized to improve efficiency and effectiveness. \nOrientation seminars will also be organized for key stakeholders, such as regulators and oversight \nbodies, and for the private sector in DMCs to make the transition to the new procurement \nframework seamless. Sector-, project-, or topic-specific procurement clinics will also be provided \nas needed. Train-the-trainer-type procurement clinics may also be arranged to train officials from \nexecuting agencies that handle high volume of procurement. \n \n8.  Output  2:  Procurement  procedures,  systems  of,  and/or  arrangements  with \nexecuting  agencies  or  cofinanciers  enhanced.  A  key  feature  of  the  new  procurement \nframework is ADB\u2019s ability to accept alternative procurement arrangements. The TA will support \nassessments of agency procurement systems proposed by borrowers in ADB-financed projects. \nExecuting  agencies  with  robust  systems  and  procurement  capacity  will  be  evaluated  and \naccredited. The identification of potential executing agencies will be undertaken in consultation \nwith ADB regional departments and borrowers. The TA will also appraise the procurement \narrangements of ADB\u2019s cofinanciers and other financing partners with a view to accepting the use \nof these on cofinanced projects to lower the transaction costs of borrowers through mutual \n \n6 Defined by the technical assistance. \n7 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8 ADB. 2017. ADB Establishes Fund to Promote High-Level Technology \u2013 Japan First Donor. News release. 6 May. ", "3 \n \nreliance. As for fragile or conflict-affected situations or those involving high-level technology, the \nTA will present opportunities for these kinds of scenarios to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. \nThe TA will also take into account the ongoing initiatives led by ADB\u2019s regional departments on \nhow to deal with these situations to ensure synergy. \n \n9.  Output 3: Effective knowledge management. The successful dissemination of ADB\u2019s \nsecond-generation procurement reforms will rely not only on the information drive and the various \ncapacity-building activities that executing and implementing agencies will benefit from, but also \non the knowledge management products that will be generated. Information kits will be distributed \nto orientation seminars and training workshops, and will contain useful data to provide basic \ninformation about the new procurement framework. Case studies coming from the sector-, or \nproject-, or topic-specific workshops will be compiled and will be made available in print and online \nforms for project staff, both from ADB and executing and implementing agencies, to benefit from \nthe discussions by workshop attendees. Where necessary, reading materials will be translated \ninto the languages that executing and implementing agencies have requested to help them better \nunderstand and appreciate the concepts, so that they can be applied properly in ADB-financed \nprojects. In addition, e-learning modules will be available on ADB\u2019s website for executing and \nimplementing agencies and those who are interested in ADB\u2019s new procurement framework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6 and TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. Procurement Division 1 of ADB\u2019s Operations Services and \nFinancial Management Department (OSFMD) will carry out TA activities and will select, supervise, \nand  evaluate  consultants  under  the  direction  and  implementation  oversight  of  OSFMD \nmanagement.9 The division will coordinate closely with other OSFMD divisions, ADB operation \nunits (regional departments and resident mission offices), and other sector and thematic groups \nto ensure that the benefits of ADB\u2019s new procurement framework are optimized. Where the need \narises, OSFMD procurement specialists will participate in orientation seminars and training \nworkshops as resource persons. \n \n12.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below: \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2017\u2013April 2020 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agency  Procurement Division 1, OSFMD \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Consulting firm: QCBS  Procurement  $1,000,000a \n  (90:10)  capacity building   \n    firm   \n    (20 international   \n    person-months and   \n \n9 To ensure independence of the consultant selection committee, it will be chaired by director, Procurement Division \n2, OSFMD.
