The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the enhancement of \nfinancial management capacity in Asia and the Pacific, with a focus on: (i) improving the quality \nof financial audits by private and public audit professionals; (ii) supporting the adoption of \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS);1 and (iii) developing the financial \nmanagement and audit function capacity of staff in project executing and implementing agencies \n(EAs/IAs) and supreme audit institutions (SAIs) in ADB developing member countries (DMCs).2 \n2.  This TA is included as a corporate priority TA in the Work Program and Budget Framework  \nfor 2018-2020,3  and in the annual work program of ADB\u2019s Procurement, Portfolio and Financial \nManagement Department.4 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Many ADB DMCs are challenged in meeting their development goals by weak governance \nand financial management systems. This adversely impacts public confidence in the ability of \nDMC  governments  to  produce  comprehensive  and  credible  financial  information,  which \nconstrains their ability to raise adequate capital at reasonable cost and tenor. These weaknesses \nare also found in DMC EAs/IAs and SAIs, where observed deficiencies include: (i) national \naccounting practices that do not follow recognized financial reporting frameworks or standards; \n(ii) poor-quality audits from both public and private auditors, and failure to adhere to relevant \ninternational auditing standards;5 and (iii) inadequate staff number and capacity. \n4.  A significant proportion of future investment by ADB will be in the public sector of its \nDMCs.6 It  is  imperative  that  financial  management,  reporting,  and  auditing  systems  are \nstrengthened to better manage the processes by which investment projects are selected, and to \nensure subsequent operation and management of infrastructure is undertaken in a transparent \nand responsible manner. \n5.  The TA is directly linked to: (i) the strengthening of governance and institutional capacity, \nwhich is a key operational priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030;7 and (ii) Sustainable Development \nGoal 16 (Target 16.6), which aims to \u201cdevelop effective, accountable and transparent institutions \nat all levels\u201d. The TA targets improvements in governance and financial management to create \nan  enabling  environment  for  sustainable  growth,  strengthen  service  delivery,  and  improve \ncapacity and standards. The TA will leverage ongoing cooperation with DMCs and support ADB \npolicy loans supporting economic reforms. By strengthening financial reporting and auditing in \nDMCs,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  improved  accountability,  institutional  capacity,  and  better \ngovernance, leading to more efficient use of limited resources and better service delivery. \n                                                \n1  IPSAS are a set of generally accepted accounting standards issued by the IPSAS board for use by governments and \npublic sector entities in the preparation of their financial statements. These standards are based on International \nFinancial Reporting Standards. \n2  SAIs (commonly referred to as an auditor general) carry out the external audit of public sector bodies and are a \ncritical financial accountability mechanism in most countries. \n3   ADB. 2017. Work Program and Budget Framework 2018-2020. Philippines.      \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on [day Month year] (to be inserted \nafter approval). \n5  International Auditing Standards are standards for the performance of audit of financial information, issued by the \nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. \n6  The aggregate climate-adjusted infrastructure investment need for Asia and the Pacific is estimated at $26.2 trillion \nfrom 2016 to 2030, equal to an average annual requirement of $1.7 trillion. \n7  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "2 \nStrengthening EA/IA financial management and SAI audit capacity would also contribute to \neffective implementation of anticorruption measures\u2014sound financial reporting and SAI audit \nquality contribute to the robust management and control of public resources and effective delivery \nof public services. \n6.  Private sector auditing capacity in many parts of Asia and the Pacific is constrained by \nlimited resources, poor professional competence, and a lack of or weak regulatory oversight. \nImplementing an auditor quality assurance program would create an enabling environment for \ncapacity development of the private sector auditing profession. A robust quality assurance system \nwould  enhance  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  international  professional  and  ethical \nstandards and reinforce best practices through timely investigation and discipline, and instill public \nconfidence. This will contribute to the production of high-quality and reliable audited financial \nstatements, which is a critical accountability mechanism. \n7.  SAIs are public sector audit organizations that focus on accountability and transparency \nin the use of public funds. They are uniquely placed to help build and sustain stronger, more \neffective  accountability mechanisms.  SAIs  conduct  many  audits  of  varying types,  including \nfinancial,  performance,  compliance,  and  other  ad  hoc  audits.  Despite  the  acknowledged \nimportance of SAIs for development effectiveness, public sector auditing in many countries is the \nweakest component of public financial management (PFM).8 Strengthening SAIs by building their \ncapacity and developing systems and procedures for effective implementation of an audit quality \nmanagement  framework  (AQMF)  will  result  in  better-quality  audits  and  help  improve  PFM \npractices. \n8.  Adoption  by  DMCs  of  IPSAS  and  issuance  of  IPSAS-compliant  audited  financial \nstatements would represent a significant achievement. Implementation of IPSAS improves the \ncomprehensiveness,  quality,  and  comparability  of  financial  reporting,  while  increasing \naccountability and transparency. In addition, strengthened internal controls and stronger quality \nassurance  mechanisms  will  better  support  government  efforts  to  realize  their  fiscal  goals. \nIncreased understanding of financial information contributes to informed decision-making and \nincreased accountability in public resource use and asset management. \n9.  Robust financial management capacity on the part of EA/IA staff is critical to improving \ngovernance, transparency, and accountability with respect to the use of public and donor funds. \nBetter understanding of financial reporting and audit requirements would promote better allocation \nand  management  of  public  and  donor  resources,  and  ultimately  strengthen  public  service \nprovision by DMCs. \n10.  The TA identifies several DMCs for participation. More may be included in the future in \nresponse to: (i) a direct request by the respective government; (ii) implementation of ADB policy-\nbased lending to strengthen governance and PFM; and/or (iii) a strong commitment by in-country \ncounterparts to strengthening financial management. \n11.  The TA will build on the following lessons from ADB\u2019s ongoing regional TA:9 (i) private \nauditor  quality  assurance  programs  are  regular,  continuous,  and  long-term,  and  require \nmethodological and financial support to sustain momentum and achieve meaningful results; and \n                                                \n8  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2011.

The TA \nwill continue program support for these DMCs for the next 3 years of the quality assurance system \nimplementation cycle. Armenia and the Philippines will be included under the TA to establish and \nimplement quality assurance systems.11 \n12.  The  TA  will  help  strengthen  governance  and  institutional  capacity  in  DMCs  by: \n(i) continuing beyond the 30 June 2019 closing date the work begun under ADB\u2019s ongoing TA \n(footnote 9) on private audit quality assurance programs in four countries, and extending this work \nto two more DMCs; (ii) addressing IPSAS implementation for Uzbekistan and AQMF for Pakistan \n(these were not included under the ongoing TA);12 and (iii) addressing the need for financial \nmanagement capacity building of EAs/IAs and SAIs.   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: governance strengthened, and institutional \ncapacity and standards improved in participating DMCs\u2019 financial management. The TA will have \nthe  following  outcome:  public  and  private  audit  and  accounting  capacity  for  improved \nmanagement of public resources enhanced.13 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n14.  Output 1: Private auditor quality assurance programs implemented. High-quality \naudits reinforce good governance, accountability, participation, predictability, and transparency. \nThis enhances the confidence of stakeholders in the credibility of financial reports. The TA will \ncontinue the implementation of quality assurance systems in Cambodia, Georgia, Nepal, and \nSamoa,  while  designing  and  implementing  quality  assurance  systems  in  Armenia  and  the \nPhilippines.  This  will  help  in  the  development  of  capable  and  competent  accountancy \nprofessionals, promotion of strong professional and ethical standards, enhancement of the quality \nof financial reporting and auditing, and improvement of the quality of audited financial statements \nfor  ADB-funded  projects.  Output  1  will  focus  on  Armenia,  Cambodia,  Georgia,  Nepal,  the \nPhilippines, and Samoa.14 \n15.  Output 2: Uzbekistan International Public Sector Accounting Standards road map \ndeveloped. IPSAS implementation results in increased transparency, which provides a better \nunderstanding of a country\u2019s financial performance, greater accountability to make informed \ndecisions about resource utilization, and improved financial information to support governance, \nmanagement of assets, and decision-making. The TA will support: (i) development of a cash basis \n                                                \n10 The ongoing TA is currently scheduled to close on 30 June 2019 and is expected to fully achieve its outcomes. \n11 Armenia has been selected for participation as it currently has a policy-based loan with ADB. Philippines is included \nbased on a request received from the government. \n12 Uzbekistan has been selected for participation as it currently has a policy-based loan with ADB. Pakistan is included \nbased on a request received from the Auditor General of Pakistan.  \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 PPFD has closely consulted with and will continue to coordinate with the Public Management, Financial Sector, and \nTrade Division of Central and West Asia Department and Southeast Asia Department with regard to the participation \nof Armenia and Philippines in the TA. More DMCs may be included in the TA during the implementation period based \non criteria identified in para. 10. \n \n ", "4 \nIPSAS implementation road map for Uzbekistan; and (ii) advisory and methodological assistance \nto the Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance until formal adoption of the road map.15 Uzbekistan is \nundertaking important economic reforms that will ensure that future growth is broad-based and \ninclusive. These reforms are supported by an ADB policy-based loan that will finance two \nsubprograms to be implemented during 2018\u20132019.16 IPSAS implementation in Uzbekistan will \nenable better accountability, transparency, and governance of public spending and revenues. \nWhile developing the road map, the TA will leverage the IPSAS e-learning module developed \nunder ongoing TA (footnote 9). \n16.  Output 3: Pakistan audit quality management framework implemented. This will \ncontribute to capacity building and system development for AQMF implementation by Pakistan\u2019s \nauditor general (its SAI), and is based on a proposal submitted to ADB by Pakistan\u2019s SAI through \nthe International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions\u2019 Donor Cooperation Secretariat. \nPakistan\u2019s SAI adopted the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) and is \nbuilding its staff capacity to comply with the standards. The AQMF is an important tool to address \ninstitutional reform of Pakistan\u2019s SAI as it moves towards full alignment with ISSAI 40.17 AQMF \nimplementation  will  improve  the  quality  of  audits  undertaken  by  Pakistan\u2019s  SAI,  thereby \nstrengthening the transparency of public institutions, and the accountability of donor- and DMC-\nfunded projects. The TA will: (i) train Pakistan SAI staff in principles and procedures of audit \nquality management; (ii) assist in developing an organizational structure, and systems and \nprocedures for implementation of AQMF; and (iii) provide advisory support to ensure that quality \nmanagement is mainstreamed across all functions of the organization and all steps of auditing. \n17.  Output 4: Training of EAs/IAs and SAI staff in financial management conducted. The \ncapacity of EAs/IAs and/or SAI financial management staff in effective, efficient, and transparent \naccounting and auditing of the use of public funds will be developed through regional training. \nTraining under output 4 will be available to all DMCs, but priority will be given to staff of EAs/IAs \nfor ADB projects that face financial management issues and challenges. Women will account for \nat least 40% of all EAs/IAs and/or SAI staff trained. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Financial Management Division of ADB\u2019s PPFD \nwill implement the TA in collaboration with regional departments, key professional accounting \norganizations, national audit regulators, and SAIs. Knowledge and resources from ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments and ADB\u2019s ongoing TA (footnote 9) will support the TA reform efforts. The TA will \ncapture and share public financial management knowledge and best practices with all DMCs \nthrough public disclosure of relevant documents on ADB\u2019s project website. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n15 The  Public  Financial  Management  Division  has  discussed  the  participation  of  Uzbekistan  with  the  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division. \n16 ADB.
