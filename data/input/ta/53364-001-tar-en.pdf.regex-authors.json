INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen  the  financial \nsustainability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Papua New Guinea (PNG), helping to improve \npublic service delivery. The TA will provide advisory support to improve the overarching policy \nand  legal  framework  for  SOE  governance.  It  will  also  support  reforms  to  strengthen  and \nrestructure operations in specific SOEs. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational \npriority  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  especially  in  small  island \ndeveloping states, which face severe institutional capacity constraints.1 Under Strategy 2030, \nADB will support SOE reforms in small island developing states to strengthen the quality of public \nservice delivery, reduce the costs of doing business, and promote private-sector-led growth. The \nTA is also in line with the implementation priorities of the PNG country partnership strategy, under \nwhich  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  management  assistance  will  include  support  for  SOE  reform, \nimprovements in the business legal environment, and greater competition.2 The TA is in response \nto a direct request from the Government of PNG to support comprehensive reforms to its SOE \nportfolio.3 A  concept  paper  for  this  TA,  with  a  budget  of  $750,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-6), was approved on 21 October 2019.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Key  challenges.  Most  essential  services\u2014including  energy,  water  supply, \ntelecommunications, ports, and air transport\u2014are provided through SOEs. Kumul Consolidated \nHoldings (KCH) operates as the holding company for the government\u2019s non-mineral, oil, and gas \nassets through the General Business Trust (GBT). The GBT owns the government\u2019s shares in \nnine SOEs,5 listed investments,6 other assets,7 and major projects.8 KCH is the corporate trustee \nof the GBT and is responsible for managing the SOEs\u2019 investments. \n \n4.  Available information indicates that SOEs consistently demonstrate poor operational and \nfinancial performance.9 SOEs under the GBT lost K129.9 million in 2018 and K62.3 million in 2017. \nThe consolidated debt (commercial and concessional) of KCH and the nine SOEs was about K5.8 \nbillion as of 31 March 2019, subject to ongoing reconciliation. Given the important (and often \nmonopolistic) role that the SOEs have in delivering key infrastructure services, their continued \npoor operational and financial performance results in expensive, inefficient, and low-quality \nservice provision, and affects the competitiveness of the economy as a whole. The government \nis facing fiscal challenges, with limited scope to finance the restructuring of the SOEs. \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Partnership Strategy. Papua New Guinea, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n3  The request was made through a letter from the Prime Minister of PNG addressed to the ADB country director for \nPNG, dated 24 July 2019. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 October 2019. \n5  These  are  Air  Niugini  Limited,  Motor  Vehicle  Insurance  Limited,  National  Development  Bank,  PNG  Ports \nCorporation Limited, PNG Power Limited, Post PNG Limited, Kumul Agriculture Limited, Kumul Telikom Holdings \nLimited, and Water PNG Limited. \n6  This is Bank of South Pacific Limited. \n7  These are PNG Dams, Kumul Technology Development Corporation, Government Stores, and Kumul Property. \n8  These are Port Moresby Port Redevelopment Precinct, Port Moresby Sewerage System Upgrade, and Energy \nProjects \u2013 Ramu 2. \n9  The data in this section is drawn from a briefing paper on an update of KCH\u2019s performance provided by the minister \nfor public enterprises to the National Executive Council on 10 July 2019.  \n ", "2 \n5.  Policy and legal framework. Weak legal and policy frameworks undermine commercial \nprinciples, leading to poor financial performance and service delivery. The Independent Public \nBusiness Corporation of Papua New Guinea (Kumul Consolidated Holdings) (Amendment) Act \n2015 provided the National Executive Council (NEC) with greater scope for direct oversight of \nSOEs, including powers to control board compositions of both KCH and majority-owned SOEs, \nauthorize annual plans, and approve expenditure over K10 million. This has eroded the oversight \nof the SOEs and allowed political considerations to override commercial imperatives, resulting in \na sharp decline in the financial performance of SOEs. Problems are exacerbated by the lack of \ntimely reporting and disclosure. Most SOEs do not produce annual financial statements in a timely \nmanner, and audited financial statements are not publicly available (including for KCH). Lack of \ntransparency and disclosure further inhibits accountability. Boards and management in many \nSOEs lack appropriately qualified and experienced personnel, and corporate governance does \nnot receive adequate emphasis. Women constitute less than 20% of SOE board members.10 \n \n6.  Several policy initiatives have not progressed.11 While the government gazetted the \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership (PPP) Act 2014 in early 2018, it has not been made operational. The \nPPP Act provides an overarching framework for the systematic analysis of proposed infrastructure \ninvestments, including whether private capital is likely to deliver value for money. The limited \nnumber of PPPs that have been negotiated have been done on an ad hoc basis, with insufficient \nassessment of the costs and benefits, contract terms, and consideration of alternatives. The \ngovernment has also not made its Community Service Obligation Policy (approved by the NEC in \n2012) operational. The policy provides a framework for identifying and financing noncommercial \nservices by SOEs, rather than the current practice of opaque cross-subsidization. The Consumer \nand Competition Framework Review, undertaken in 2017, called for adherence of all SOEs to \nprinciples of competitive neutrality. The framework was endorsed by the NEC in 2018, and formed \nthe basis for a draft competition policy. The policy is yet to be approved. \n \n7.  Sector-specific issues. Challenges for SOEs are also observed in particular sectors. The \ntop three SOEs in terms of debt exposure are Kumul Telikom Holdings (KTH), with exposure of \nK1.44 billion; PNG Power, with exposure of K1.21 billion; and PNG Ports, with exposure of K1.10 \nbillion. KTH merged three telecommunications companies: bMobile, PNG Telikom, and DataCo. \nAlthough the merge is legally approved, the process of integration is ongoing. Moreover, bMobile \nand DataCo are technically insolvent. KTH has a mobile market share of about 10%, against a \n90% market share of Digicel. The Fiji-owned Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited (Vodafone) \nrecently obtained a mobile license and is poised to enter the market. KTH estimates that, with \ncritical solvency issues faced by bMobile, a cash injection of K100 million may be required in 2019. \nPNG Power works with several sole-sourced independent power producers, and commercially \nattractive opportunities have not been pursued. Financial management systems are improving \nbut are still weak. Large unpaid power bills from government clients, together with political \npressure not to increase tariffs, have made it difficult for PNG Power to reduce losses. Both the \npower and telecommunications subsectors lack adequate regulation. PNG Ports has privatized \nthe operations of the ports of Port Moresby and Lae, the two largest in the country, but may also \nwork to get private operators interested in some of the smaller ports. PNG Ports has substantial \nidle assets (e.g., land) which could be monetized as a source of cash to manage SOE liabilities. \n \n10  ADB. 2016. Finding Balance 2016.

In June 2019, a gazetted ministerial determination placed PNG Power and KTH under the \nminister of communications and energy and Air Niugini under the minister of transport. This will \ncomplicate reform efforts in these sectors, as it further blurs the lines between commercial and \npolitical decision-making. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  service  delivery  by  PNG\u2019s  SOEs \nstrengthened.12 The TA will have the following outcome: financial sustainability of PNG\u2019s SOE \nportfolio improved. The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs. 13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Advice on overarching policy and legal framework reforms provided. The \nTA will provide high-quality policy advice to government counterparts (primarily officials in the \nMinistry  of  Public  Enterprises),  which  can  be  incorporated  into  decision-making  on  the \noverarching policy and legal framework for corporate governance of SOEs. Policy advice will be \nprovided based on demand as identified through policy dialogue between government officials \nand ADB staff, and will be prioritized to address significant gaps in corporate governance \npractices. It is expected that policy advice will cover topics including (i) separating political and \ncommercial  decision-making  through  defining  the  roles  of  ministers,  SOE  boards,  and \nmanagement; (ii) reviewing and clarifying the role of KCH (with capacity-building support as \nneeded);  (iii)  improving  transparency  through  the  timely  preparation  and  public  release  of \nstatements of corporate objectives, appropriate key performance indicators, annual operating \nplans, and audited annual accounts; (iv) clarifying procurement processes (in line with the \nNational Procurement Act 2018);14 (v) implementing a transparent, skills-based process for SOE \ndirector selection and appointment (which would include particular measures to encourage \nwomen\u2019s representation  at the  board  level);  (vi)  identifying  and  costing  community service \nobligations as part of the corporate planning process; (vii) addressing the backlog of accounts \nwith  the  auditor  general;  (viii)  promoting  an  environment  for  greater  competition;  and  (ix) \ndeveloping a framework for assessment of PPPs, including the costs and benefits, contract terms, \nand consideration of alternatives. \n \n11.  Advisory services provided through the TA can build the platform for reforms (including \nthose  potentially  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  policy-based  lending).  Gender  considerations  will  be \nincorporated into policy advice. Advisory services will build on work already undertaken with ADB \nsupport (para. 6), as applicable. Capacity building for SOE boards, management, and staff on \ncorporate governance will be provided as requested. \n \n12.  Output 2: Advice on state-owned enterprise reforms in selected sectors provided. \nThe TA will provide high-quality advice to specific SOEs in selected sectors on reforms that can \nhelp address their liabilities. This is expected to take the form of advice on specific transactions \n \n12  Defined by the TA. \n13  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14  Government of Papua New Guinea. 2017. National Procurement Act 2018.

SOEs to be supported will \nbe determined in consultation with the government, and priority is expected to be given to SOEs \nwith significant liabilities and to sectors where there is a greater need for development partner \nsupport. The TA will support the Ministry of Public Enterprises in outreach with other PNG \nstakeholders (e.g., Treasury, the attorney general, the NEC, and line ministries) to promote \nuptake of policy advice and recommendations, and also in managing changes under the reform \nprocess. \n \n13.  Advisory services provided under the TA will be closely coordinated with services provided \nunder the proposed Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) (Phase IV) regional TA.15 Based \non lessons from TA implementation in PNG, staff from the resident mission will be closely \ninvolved.16 Relevant TA outputs will be inputs into the k-Nexus to build on ADB\u2019s accumulated \nknowledge and experience, minimize duplication, and facilitate dissemination. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $785,000 of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport estimated at $35,000 in the form of making relevant country data available and providing \ncounterpart  staff  (if  needed),  and  may  provide  other  in-kind  contributions.  Apart  from \nconsultancies, funds for training events and workshops will be provided through the TA and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The TA budget may \nbe increased during implementation subject to demand for the TA activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA over a 36-month period, from December 2019 to December \n2022. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and organize \nany workshops and training activities (in conjunction with the government). The implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2019\u2013December 2022 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Public Enterprises \nImplementing agency  Ministry of Public Enterprises \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nIndividual consultant selection  32 person-months  $722,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSources: Strategy, Policy and Review Department; approved TA concept paper; and ADB estimates. \n \n16.

ADB\u2019s objective is to provide the government with holistic \nassistance, with work under this TA and the PSDI TA complementing each other to meet PNG\u2019s \nSOE reform priorities. Implementation of the TA will be undertaken in consultation with project \nofficers in ADB\u2019s Pacific Department working in specific sectors (like energy, water, and transport) \nwhere  SOE  reforms  are  needed.  Implementation  will  also  be  coordinated  with  other  ADB \ndepartments,  including  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (on  telecommunications \nreforms) and the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships (on PPP-related transactions). \n  \n17.  ADB will also take into account TA provided by other bilateral and multilateral development \npartners,  and  their  operations,  through  regular  communication.  Key  partners  include  the \ngovernments of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States who are active, particularly in the \npower subsector; the International Monetary Fund, which expects to approve a staff monitoring \nprogram for PNG in 2019 with SOE reform as one of the pillars; and the World Bank, which is \npreparing  a  budget  support  program  anchored  on  fiscal  reforms.  While  no  cofinancing  is \nenvisaged at this time, opportunities will be explored during TA implementation. \n \n18.  Consulting services. The TA will require a total of 32 person-months of individual \nconsultants,  including  29  person-months  of  international  and  3  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services. ADB will engage the consultants and carry out procurement following the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The  TOR  for  national  and  international  individual  consultants  are  in  the  TOR  for \nconsultants.17 The specific requirements for types of expertise and length of engagement will \ndepend  on  the  scope  of  work,  which  will  be  determined  more  specifically  during  TA \nimplementation in consultation with the government, taking into account evolving activities of other \ndevelopment partners and the government\u2019s own prioritized SOE reform plan, which is under \ndevelopment.18 More comprehensive TOR will be developed accordingly, particular sectors and \ntransactions to be supported will be identified, and deliverables from consultancy outputs will be \nfurther clarified. Consultants will be engaged on a continuous or intermittent basis, as necessary. \nAreas of expertise will include those needed to undertake SOE corporate governance reforms, \nsupport PPP and privatization transactions for selected SOEs, and provide legal and regulatory \nadvice for required policy changes. Experienced experts will be recruited as lead consultants, with \ntechnical support from national consultants who have local knowledge. The recruitment process \nfor consultants will commence early in 2020, after the TOR have been finalized with inputs from \ngovernment counterparts. Consultants will be required to submit final reports to ADB and the \ngovernment. Evaluation of their performance will be based on the findings of assessments by \nADB and the government. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nPapua New Guinea for Supporting State-Owned Enterprise Reforms, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n17 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n18 The Ministry of Public Enterprises has prepared a draft SOE reform matrix for 2020\u20132022, which is under internal \ngovernment consultation. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nService delivery by PNG\u2019s SOEs strengtheneda \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  By 2023:     \n \nFinancial  Consolidated losses of Kumul  Report from the  Weakening political \nsustainability of  Consolidated Holdings and SOEs  Ministry of Public  commitment to and \nPNG\u2019s SOEs  under General Business Trust  Enterprises  public support for \nimproved  reduced by at least 10% (2019  SOE reforms \nbaseline: K147 million) \n \nOutputs  By 2022:     \n   \n1.
