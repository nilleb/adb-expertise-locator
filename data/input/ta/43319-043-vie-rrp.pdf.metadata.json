I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Urban Environmental \nInfrastructure Fund1 (UEIF) under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility (UFPF), both to the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Corridor  Towns \nDevelopment Project. This is one of three projects for GMS corridor towns; the other two will be \nin Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).2 \n \n2.  The project will enhance the competitiveness of towns along the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor (EWEC) and the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC) and support the development of \nthe GMS transport corridors into vibrant economic corridors. The project will transform the \ncorridor towns of Dong Ha, Lao Bao, and Moc Bai into economic hubs by improving urban \nenvironmental infrastructure and strengthening institutional capacities of provincial and local \nauthorities. Increased climate resilience through flood control measures will significantly improve \nthe productivity of economic enterprises in these towns. Clean wastewater, solid-waste disposal, \nand enhanced mobility on improved urban roads will improve the environment. The project will \nprovide  environmental  infrastructure,  of  which  wastewater  treatment  and  solid-waste \nmanagement specifically will help to reduce the carbon footprint of these towns, making them \ncleaner, greener, and more livable. The project finances 10 subprojects in the three towns.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic  economic  development.  Improved  transport  connectivity  among  GMS \ncountries  has  intensified  urban  links  and  established  a  solid  foundation  for  more  efficient \nmovement  of  people,  goods,  and  services.  It  has  led  to  significantly  increased  trade  and \ncommerce in border districts and corridor towns. The towns and cities along the SEC and \nEWEC, which link Viet Nam with Cambodia and the Lao PDR, are well positioned to serve as \ndynamic  centers  of  investment  and  economic  growth.  Given  the  tremendous  economic \nopportunities,  the  corridor  towns  face  the  challenge  of  meeting  the  demands  for  urban \ninfrastructure and essential support services which are a result of rapid urban population growth \nand  urban  expansion.  With  the  proper  enabling  environment  for  strategic  local  economic \ndevelopment, provision of adequate infrastructure, and institutional capacity to manage future \ndevelopment, the corridor towns are expected to attract public sector investments in urban \nenvironment  infrastructure  and  encourage  private  sector  interest  in  urban  economic \ninfrastructure. \n \n4.  This project is phase 1 of a long-term engagement in GMS economic corridor towns, and \nis aligned with the strategic framework of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program, 2012\u2013\n2022, approved by the Fourth GMS Summit on 19\u201320 December 2011. It is also in line with the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 for Viet Nam,4 and \nsupports ADB\u2019s urban operational plan, 2012\u201320205 and water operational plan, 2011\u20132020.6 \n \n                                                \n1  Contributor:  the Government of Sweden, administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The participating corridor towns in Viet Nam face the pressing task of \ncoping with the demands of a rapidly growing urban population and expanding urban areas. \nThere have been major problems with the inadequate capacity of local authorities to plan and \nmanage urban growth in an integrated way, operate and maintain urban infrastructure, and \nefficiently  deliver  municipal  services.  Despite  reforms  to  promote  decentralization,  local \ninstitutional  capacity  development  has  not  kept  pace  with  urban  sector  development  and \neconomic growth. With increasing trade and traffic flows, there is an urgent need to strengthen \nthe  capacities  of  the  corridor  towns  to  manage  local  economic  development  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. \n \n6.  Project areas. Three corridor towns were selected as project areas: Dong Ha and Lao \nBao in Quang Tri Province and Moc Bai in Tay Ninh Province. \n \n7.  Dong Ha is on Viet Nam's east coast, north of the historic city of Hue and the port city of \nDa Nang. This corridor town is the center of political, cultural, and economic activities in Quang \nTri Province. It is located on the intersection of National Road 1A and Road 9, which provide \ntransport connectivity and easy access to the Lao PDR and Thailand through the Lao Bao\u2013\nDansavanh border. The strategic location of Dong Ha makes it the leading regional trade and \ninvestment center along the EWEC. \n \n8.  Lao Bao is a border town along the EWEC, which is an important trade and traffic link \nbetween Viet Nam, the Lao PDR, and Thailand. The town is developing rapidly as an industrial \ntownship for export of consumer articles. Within the town center is the Lao Bao Border Gate \nSpecial  Economic  and  Trade  Zone,  which  is  stimulating  economic  activity  and  providing \nemployment for local people. \n \n9.  Moc Bai, on the border of Viet Nam and Cambodia along the SEC, is a newly emerging \ndestination for large manufacturers as well as small and medium-sized enterprises outside Ho \nChi Minh City. The national and provincial people\u2018s committees have designated the town a Tay \nNinh Province economic trade zone. Establishment of the SEC has attracted manufacturing and \nindustry locators, providing economic opportunities to local residents and migrant workers. \n \n10.  Related policies and strategies. The government issued a policy declaration to pursue \na balanced socioeconomic strategy through the development of key economic centers, as well \nas  secondary  cities  and  towns,  to  further  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  5-year  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, the main pillar of Viet Nam\u2019s strategic plan, stipulated the focus of \nurban development on (i) promoting the linking of urban and rural economies, (ii) improving \nurban planning and management, (iii) developing small and medium-sized towns and cities, and \n(iv) developing economic corridors by building economic nodes on the corridors. Under this \nstrategy, the functions of small and medium-sized towns are crucial in terms of their role as \nmarkets  and  transport hubs for  agricultural goods,  products from  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises, and manufacturing industries. The government\u2019s strategy is also reflected in the \nwater supply and other municipal infrastructure and services sector assessment (summary).7 \n \n11.  Lessons. Based on the experience gained from completed ADB-financed urban sector \ndevelopment projects, the relevant lessons learned are as follows: (i) the project implementation \nschedule should be carefully assessed during appraisal, taking into account the government\u2019s \nlengthy approval procedures; (ii) selecting qualified project management consultants familiar \nwith local rules and regulations is important for successful project implementation; (iii) the \n                                                \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure and Services (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    3 \nnumber of procurement packages should be minimized, considering the workload for contract \nmanagement, while ensuring competitiveness among qualified contractors; and (iv) advance \naction  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  should  be  undertaken  to  facilitate  project \nimplementation  because  consultation  and  agreement  with  affected  households  takes \nconsiderable time. The project design responds to these lessons with a schedule that has \nsufficient preparation time, a limited number of procurement packages, and adequate project \nmanagement support. \n12.  Special  features.  The  project  has  three  special  features:  (i)  support  for  regional \ndevelopment in the GMS (and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) through the creation \nof growth engines in corridor towns across the GMS countries; (ii) recycling of solid waste \nthrough innovative materials recovery facilities (MRFs) for waste segregation, with cofinancing \nfrom the UEIF of the UFPF; and (iii) support for increased decentralization by strengthening \nprovincial and district authorities.8 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The expected impact of the project is for Dong Ha City, Lao Bao, and Moc Bai to \nbecome dynamic economic growth centers in the EWEC and SEC. The expected outcome is \nadequate and efficient urban infrastructure and services in Dong Ha City, Lao Bao, and Moc \nBai. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  Priority infrastructure. The outputs include (i) endorsement of strategic local economic \ndevelopment  plans;  (ii)  priority  infrastructure  investments;  and  (iii)  capacity  development, \nincluding a master plan for Dong Ha City. The priority subprojects in the three corridor towns are \noutlined in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Subprojects \nSubproject and \nLocation  Subproject Description \n1.

Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis was undertaken for all subprojects with the computation of economic \ninternal rate of return, net present value, and benefit\u2013cost ratio. Benefits that were quantified \nand valued included savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time for the road subprojects; \nhealth benefits, reduction in flood damage, and reduction in economic productivity time loss for \nthe drainage and flood control subprojects; economic efficiency of recovering recyclable wastes \nand reduction in costs of disposal for MRFs; and willingness to pay for water supply, wastewater \nsystem,  and  solid-waste  management.  Given  the  varying  nature  of  the  subprojects,  the \nexpected beneficiaries of the overall project also constitute a diverse group. They include road \nusers, the business sector, tourism service providers, property owners, and households. The \nbase-case results indicate all components are economically viable with an estimated economic \ninternal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \nResults ranged from 12% to 30%. All subprojects were generally also viable under adverse \nscenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower by 10% than the base case.11 \n \n22.  For  four  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects  (three  urban  roads  and  one  river \nembankment protection subproject), the executing agency has to provide funds through annual \nbudgetary allocations to cover the required O&M costs and ensure project sustainability. The \nfinancial analysis focused on historical annual budget allocations from the executing agency. Six \nof the 10 subprojects were considered revenue generating, thus financial internal rates of return \nwere computed taking into consideration the level of fees that can be collected from their \noperations.  These  include  the  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  solid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nwaste management, MRF, and river port rehabilitation subprojects. Resulting financial internal \nrates of return range from 2% to 23%, all above the computed weighted average cost of \ncapital.12 \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  The PPCs of Quang Tri and Tay Ninh provinces will adhere to the transparency and \naccountability  elements  of  good  governance  in  terms  of  financial  management  and  fund \ndisbursements. Through their direct participation and involvement in undertaking procurement \nprocedures of an ADB-financed project, the PPCs will develop their institutional capacity to \nundertake international and national competitive bidding for civil works. Based on assessments \nof financial management and procurement capacity, the provincial and district authorities have \n                                                \n11  Economic Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Financial Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nlimited experience in projects funded by official development assistance. Thus, the project will \nprovide capacity development assistance and training programs on financial management, fund \ndisbursement, and procurement procedures of ADB and the government. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Urban poverty. Based on the household survey and the urban poverty line of D500,000 \nper person per month, the proportion of poor people in the participating towns is 9.0% in Moc \nBai, 13.5% in Dong Ha, and 22.0% in Lao Bao. The poor live in areas where they often suffer \nfrom  serious  water  supply  shortages,  poor  water quality,  wastewater  pollution,  poor  urban \nenvironmental sanitation, and inadequate roads and drainage. They have less capacity to cope \nwith pollution and degraded environments. In turn, they suffer from increased exposure and \nrisks due to surface water, groundwater, and air pollution, which further adds to their poverty \nsituation. Through the implementation of the subprojects, the project will improve the living \nenvironment and health status of the urban residents, especially the poor. Poverty reduction \nimpacts will be made by assisting poor people, especially women, in improving their skills and \naccessing employment opportunities through the measures included in the gender action plan. \nThere will be short-term employment benefits during the construction stage.13 \n \n26.  Based on the survey, households headed by women account for 20%\u201338% of the \nbeneficiary households, of which between 48% and 63% are headed by single women. The \nsubprojects will provide individual and household benefits to women. Women are primarily \nresponsible for disposing of wastewater, disposing of and managing household garbage, and \ncaring for the sick and elderly. Time and effort spent on these activities will be significantly \nreduced for women so they can engage in income-generating activities and have more family or \nleisure  time.  Lack  of  wastewater  treatment  and  solid  waste  disposal  contribute  to  gender \ninequities in the burden of household work. While both women and men will gain from the \nwastewater system and treatment plant subprojects, women can benefit in a number of other \ndirect and indirect ways. As they have primary domestic responsibilities, improving wastewater \ndisposal will ease burdens and reduce both anxiety over exposure to waterborne illnesses and \ntime spent caring for sick family members as a result of contracting a waterborne illness. The \nproject will mitigate any negative impacts. The  gender action plan includes measures and \nactivities that will enhance the benefits to women through participatory community development, \nemployment  during  construction,  improvements  in  sanitation  and  hygiene,  and  awareness-\nraising programs. The design and monitoring framework and the PAM include gender-specific \ntargets. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment.  The  environment  category  for  the  project  is  B,  as  the  proposed \nsubprojects are not expected to have irreversible adverse environmental impacts; any impacts \nare easily mitigated. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) conducted for all the project cities \nidentified potential impacts and mitigation measures to be implemented through environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs).14 The IEEs also included inputs from public consultations. The IEEs \n                                                \n13 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Initial Environmental Examination: Dong Ha, Lao Bao, and Moc Bai Subprojects; Initial Environmental Examination: \nEnvironmental Management Plan for Dong Ha Subproject; Initial Environmental Examination: Environmental ", "    9 \nare  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  applicable \nenvironmental regulations of the Government of Viet Nam. At the detailed design stage, when \nthe  EMPs  are  finalized  and  updated,  the  final  receiving  environments  for  the  wastewater \ntreatment plants and landfill will be reviewed to ensure that local groundwater and human uses \nof  the  areas  are  not  adversely  affected.  Estimated  costs  for  implementing  the  EMP  were \nintegrated into the project costs. The final EMP, cleared by ADB, will form part of the contract \nbidding  documents.  Environmental  considerations  during  design  and allocation  of  sufficient \nbudget for operation and maintenance (O&M) will help mitigate potential adverse impacts during \noperation. Effective environmental monitoring at all stages of subproject implementation will be \nensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements, the \nsafeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n28.  Land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  safeguard  category  for \ninvoluntary resettlement is A. Three resettlement plans have been prepared for the subprojects \nwhich  will  have  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.15 The  required  land  comprises \n101.68  hectares.  A  total  of  2,394  households,  or  10,005  people,  will  be  affected  by  land \nacquisition and resettlement in the priority subprojects of Quang Tri and Tay Ninh. Of these, the \nsubprojects in Dong Ha City will result in 1,176 affected households (4,704 affected people); in \nLao Bao, 958 (3,832 affected people); and in Moc Bai, 260 (1,469 affected people). A total of 61 \naffected households (261 affected people) require relocation: 38 (152 affected people) in Dong \nHa, 10 (261 affected people) in Moc Bai, and 13 (52 affected people) in Lao Bao. All other \nimpacts are partial and temporary. The overall resettlement costs for the subprojects are $12.87 \nmillion.  A  cutoff  date  has  been  established  with  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and \nparticipation.  Project  information  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  people  throughout  project \npreparation and a project information booklet will be updated and distributed during detailed \nmeasurement survey. \n29.  Resettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities, agreeing with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Government Decree No. \n69, 2009 which govern resettlement and compensation. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure and consultation requirements, the resettlement plans will be posted on the ADB \nwebsite. A grievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding \nproject performance. The resettlement plans, IEE, and EMPs will be updated and disclosed \nafter detailed design and cleared by ADB prior to contract awards. \n \n30.  Indigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples  living  near  or  close to the \nsubproject  sites  in the three  participating  corridor  towns. The small  number  of  indigenous \npeoples in any of the subproject locations who are residing in remote villages will not be \naffected  by  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects.  The  project  is  assigned  category  C; \ntherefore, there is no need to prepare an indigenous peoples plan. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nmanagement plan and summarized in Table 5.16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nManagement Plan for Lao Bao Subproject; and Initial Environmental Examination: Environmental Management \nPlan for Moc Bai Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Resettlement Plan: Dong Ha Subproject; Resettlement Plan: Lao Bao Subproject; and Resettlement Plan: Moc Bai \nSubproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCorridor towns are unable to generate revenues from  PPCs as executing agencies and DPIs as implementing \nwater supply and wastewater treatment in Moc Bai, solid- agencies  will  organize  revenue  collection  through \nwaste management in Lao Bao, and port rehabilitation in  municipal  service  companies  (water  companies  and \nDong Ha.  waste  management  companies).

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n32.  The Government of Viet Nam has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nadhere to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain provisions \nfor the project which are set forth in the loan, grant, and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR84,183,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board; and  \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of the grant not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project, to be provided by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund \nunder the Urban Financing Partnership Facility. \n \nBindu Lohani  \nVice-President \n21 November 2012 ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and Indicators  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nDong Ha City, Lao  By 2023:  The government \nBao, and Moc Bai    Annual provincial and  continues to place a \nbecome dynamic  GDP per capita in Quang Tri Province  district  statistics  high priority on \neconomic growth  increased from $780 in 2010 to $2,244  development of \ncenters in the East\u2013 in 2023   secondary cities and \nSocioeconomic surveys \nWest Economic    towns. \nCorridor and Southern  GDP per capita in Tay Ninh Province   \nHousehold surveys (sex \nEconomic Corridor.  increased from $1,317 in 2010 to  Risk \ndisaggregated to identify \n$4,731 in 2023  Corridor towns are \nincomes for households \n  unable to generate \nheaded by both men and \nWomen participation in gainful  sufficient revenues \nwomen) \neconomic activitiesa increased to 54%  from water supply \n \n(2012 baseline: 52%)   and wastewater \nPost-project evaluation \ntreatment in Moc Bai, \nreports \nsolid-waste \nmanagement in Lao \nBoa, and river \nembankment \nprotection and port \nrehabilitation in Dong \nHa City. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nUrban infrastructure  By 2018:    The government \nand services are    Annual reports of Dong  remains committed to \nadequate and operate  More than 62 km of urban roads  Ha City People\u2019s  sustainable \nefficiently in Dong Ha  providing ease of access and mobility  Committee, Huong Hoa  management of urban \nCity, Lao Bao, and  to more than 200,000 local residents  District People\u2019s  infrastructure as a \nMoc Bai.
