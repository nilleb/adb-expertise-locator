INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) requested assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to continue supporting civil aviation following successful achievements \nunder the ongoing Civil Aviation Development Investment Program.1 The subsequent program is \nwell aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to expand connectivity to markets, jobs, social services \nand protection, and strengthening governance and institutions. It will contribute to environmental \nsustainability, climate change and disaster resilience, and gender equality.2        \n \n2.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) project will analyze prevalent \naviation issues and prepare and/or update the longer-term aviation road map, policy framework, \nand investment program considering lessons from the ongoing program.3 The outputs of the TA \nwill help develop a second civil aviation investment program for ADB assistance.4 The TA is listed \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for PNG, 2018\u20132020.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Air transport services play a critical role in PNG\u2019s domestic mobility because of the \ncountry\u2019s geography. PNG sits in the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, north of Australia, \nin the southwest Pacific Ocean. It comprises both the mainland and some 600 offshore islands. \nThe population is about 7 million, of which approximately 85% lives in rural areas while the other \n15% lives in the 10 major urban areas. \n \n4.  The government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan III prioritizes tourism, agriculture, and \nconnectivity as key development targets, with high expectations for air transport.6 This strategic \nplan, aligned with the current administration\u2019s term until 2022, would be the main guiding \ndocument for all segments of the economy to deliver on their operational plans. For the transport \nsector, strategic directions are provided in the National Transport Strategy, which aims to provide \nan affordable and equitable balance between transport services that serve PNG\u2019s main economic \nsectors and those that provide reliable access to PNG\u2019s widely distributed rural population.7 The \nNational Transport Strategy sets out the government\u2019s key policy and institutional reforms, \ntargeting aviation intuitions, market-entry and competition regulations, ownership of airports and \noperators, cost recovery and community service obligations, role of private sector, service \nstandards, aviation safety and security, and environmental standards. \n \n5.  The ongoing investment program focuses on improving compliance of the major airports \noperated by the National Airports Corporation (NAC) with the safety and security standards of the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and provides long-term maintenance with total of \n$480 million ADB loans. By completion of the investment program in 2019, key results will be (i) \n13 airport terminals and landside facilities built or upgraded; (ii) 15 airport runways, taxiways, and \nairside facilities improved, including security fencing; and (iii) ICAO certification of Jacksons \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.

Port Moresby. \n \n ", "2 \nInternational Airport. The investment program helped restructure the Civil Aviation Authority into \nlegal entities with separate functional responsibilities\u2014i.e., the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to \nregulate the safety and security of civil aviation; the NAC to run 22 domestic airports, including \nJacksons International Airport; and PNG Air Service Limited to manage air traffic services. \nRecognizing the critical need for connectivity for the rural population, the government has also \nentered into contract with the Rural Airstrips Agency (RAA), which operates and maintains about \n60 of the 450 airstrips that were once usable.8 \n \n6.  The government\u2019s priority for aviation as outlined in the Medium-Term Development Plan \nIII is to provide connectivity to PNG\u2019s rural hinterlands, especially the economically vibrant isolated \nmarket segments, through provision of safe, reliable, and cost-effective air transport services that \npromote tourism and greater socioeconomic activities. In doing so, strategic focus will be (i) to \ncontinue strengthening aviation policies and institutions and to achieve ICAO and Civil Aviation \nSafety Authority compliance for all remaining airports; (ii) to upgrade and modernize landside and \nairside facilities for selected airports to handle larger jets and meet demand for passenger and \ncargo transport; (iii) to increase usage of rural airstrips by up to 50%, which will ensure equitable \nand balanced delivery of public services to a wider population; and (iv) to enable public\u2013private \npartnership for Jacksons International Airport. \n \n7.  The absence of feasible land transport in many parts of PNG, unsafe and poor state of \nrural airstrips and airport infrastructure, and lack of adequate funding and investment continue to \nlimit connectivity. Weak policies and regulations and a suboptimal tariff structure make business \nunprofitable for airline operators and create weak and inefficient aviation institutions. \n \n8.  Therefore, TA is required to analyze lessons from the investment program and issues \nconstraining aviation. The TA project will (i) prepare and/or update the subsector road map for \naviation and the aviation policy framework and medium- to long-term investment plan, identifying \ncritical policy actions needed to achieve operational efficiency, compliance with ICAO safety \nstandards, and the provision of equitable and affordable air transport services to the wider PNG \npopulation; (ii) introduce hub-and-spoke concepts for air transport services and validate the \nfeasibility of modernizing and upgrading selected national and regional airports, and the viability \nof selected rural airstrips; and (iii) undertake due diligence to prepare the ensuing investment \nprogram, including an assessment of the aviation segment; technical, economic, and financial \nappraisals; and environmental, social, gender, and poverty impact assessments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: affordable and equitable balance between \ntransport services that serve PNG\u2019s main economic sectors and those that provide reliable access \nto its widely distributed rural population (footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: a \ncomprehensive civil aviation investment program suitable for ADB financing prepared.9 \n                                                \n8  The RAA is a Goroka-based not-for-profit organization established in 2014. The RAA\u2019s activities are aimed at \nimproving aviation safety and providing greater access to essential services for remote communities. These services \ninclude health, education, community development, and commercial markets for cash crops. The RAA receives \nbudget appropriations from the government to restore and oversee operation and maintenance of rural airstrips, but \nfunding has been unstable and declining. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "    3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  The proposed TA approach is to develop an integrated program toward (i) delivery of basic \nservices and sustainable connectivity; (ii) infrastructure investments and capacity development; \nand (iii) aviation policy interventions to enable efficiency, cost recovery, and equitable service \ndelivery. The TA is expected to comprehensively tackle physical and nonphysical bottlenecks in \nclose coordination with other development partners. It will consist of: \n \n11.  Output 1: Aviation road map, policy framework, and investment program prepared. \nThe TA will review existing aviation policy and regulatory framework, undertake deeper analysis \nof the main investment and noninvestment bottlenecks, and prepare an overall subsector growth \nstrategy and policy framework as well as an investment program. The policy framework will \nidentify the main challenges and operating conditions related to cost recovery, sustainability, \nefficiency, competition, targets for change and reform actions, and recommend measures to \naddress them. It will also identify gender-inclusive policy actions. \n \n12.  Output 2: Hub-and-spoke system for air transport services prepared. In light of the \ngovernment\u2019s three pronged \u201ctourism\u2013agriculture\u2013connectivity\u201d development plan, the NAC is \nfocusing on an integrated strategy to link functional and maintainable rural airstrips to selected \nregional airports (about five or six that comply with PNG civil aviation regulations), thus linking \nthose regional airports to one or more of the country\u2019s main national airports (the busiest and \nmost crucial, which are ICAO compliant). This \u201chub\u2013and\u2013spoke\u201d system is intended to facilitate \nthe government\u2019s strategy. The infrastructure of the identified rural airstrips and regional and \nnational airports require modernization and upgrading to handle larger-body aircraft and terminal \nfacilities that are more versatile, functional, and efficient. The TA will help scope out and prioritize \ninvestments for upgrading and modernization by applying this hub-and-spoke approach. \n \n13.  Output 3: Due diligence for investment projects undertaken. Based on the results of \noutputs 1 and 2, the TA will identify investment, institutional development, and capacity building \nproposals for subsequent ADB and other donors\u2019 programmatic support. Investments will mainly \ntarget modernization of key national and regional airports under the NAC and strategically \nselected rural airstrips structured around the \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d concept. High readiness will be the \nkey determinant for screening the projects. Large-scale land acquisition or disputed ownership \nwould be avoided. The TA project will assess feasible approaches to developing rural airstrips \nand will develop models for funding support. The priority physical and nonphysical investments \ninclude (i) upgrading and modernizing Tokua, Madang, and other critical airports being developed \nunder the ongoing program; (ii) new or upgrading of air traffic control towers and radar facilities \nfor Jacksons, Nadzab, Tokua, and Madang airports; and (iii) capacity, systems, and skills \ndevelopment  to  strengthen  aviation  institutions.  Due  diligence  will  identify  gender-inclusive \nactions  and  measures  (e.g.,  ensuring  that  women  are  involved  in  skills  development  and \ndesigning airports to be gender-inclusive). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.515 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff and other in-kind contributions. \n \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The Transport, Energy and Natural Resources Division of \nADB\u2019s Pacific Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. The executing and \nimplementing agencies of the government, as indicated in Table 1, will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions. They will also provide \navailable technical feasibility studies and designs, data and information access, and facilitation of \nliaisons with stakeholders; and will guide the implementation of the TA to achieve the TA outputs \nand desired outcomes within the agreed implementation period. \n \n16.
