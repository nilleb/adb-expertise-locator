INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA)1 for the Integrated Strategy for \nSustainable Land Management in Dryland Ecosystems.2 In February 2012, an ADB mission \nvisited the PRC and reached an understanding with the government on the TA impact, outcome, \noutputs, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The  development  of  a  long-term  cooperation  framework  for  the  PRC\u2013Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems (2003\u2013\n2012)  was  initiated  in  2002  by  the  PRC  government,  with  support  from  ADB,  GEF,  the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Bank. The partnership promotes \nthe adoption of an integrated ecosystem management approach to combating land degradation \nin the northwestern region of the PRC. The future development of the partnership beyond 2012 \nwas discussed during various consultation meetings in Beijing, PRC with national and provincial \ngovernment agencies and international stakeholders. The TA report is prepared based on the \nresults of the consultation meetings to develop a renewed partnership strategy for the following \n10 years. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC suffers from some large-scale land degradation problems, such as severe \nwind  and  water  erosion,  soil  nutrient  losses,  waterlogging,  salinization,  river  system \nsedimentation, deforestation, grassland degradation, and biodiversity loss. The dryland areas of \nthe western PRC, which cover about 40% of the country\u2019s land area, contain some of the most \nseverely degraded land in the world. With only about 7% of the world\u2019s farmland and 6% of the \nworld\u2019s  annual  water  runoff,  the  PRC  must  feed  22%  of  the  world\u2019s  population.  Land \ndegradation, therefore, significantly threatens the lives of local residents, in particular, and the \nfuture economic welfare of the nation, in general. \n \n4.  The long-term framework for the partnership, updated in 2008, supports the national and \nlocal  governments\u2019  pursuit  of  a  sustainable  environment  and  development  in  drylands. \nSustainable land management (SLM) practices applied in the pilots and investment programs \nincluded reforestation, soil erosion control measures, greenhouses for vegetable production, \nmulching,  grazing  management,  and  irrigation  control.  These  practices  were  implemented \nalongside  rural  infrastructure,  rural  energy,  biogas,  solar  energy,  and  other  development \nactivities that contributed to income generation and improved livelihoods in the pilot sites. These \nactivities were supported by policy actions, legislation, thematic studies, capacity development, \nand knowledge management. The approach was institutionalized at the provincial level through \nmainstreaming strategies and an action plan to ensure investment and financial flows for SLM \nand livelihood activities. \n \n5.  Many technical and institutional aspects of the implementation and management of the \npartnership require further updating to meet the increasing demand for support and investments \nat the local levels to combat land degradation. The government and international partners have \nidentified the following development issues that need to be addressed for the partnership to \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in the 2012 non-lending pipeline in the People\u2019s Republic of China country operations business \nplan 2012\u20132014. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 10 July 2012. \n ", "2 \nsuccessfully continue: (i) the need to focus on replication and up-scaling of the achievements of \nthe partnership, with a strong emphasis on investments at the provincial level; (ii) the need to \ntarget capacity development and its linkage to demonstration and investment activities; (iii) the \nneed  for  a  broader  financial  resource  mobilization  strategy,  taking  into  consideration \ngovernment,  private  sector,  and  development  partner  resources,  as  well  as  innovative \nmechanisms such as eco-compensation programs; and (iv) the need for the program to have a \nstronger link with the PRC National Action Plan for the United Nations Convention to Combat \nDesertification  (UNCCD)  and  close  alignment  with  the  secretariat  of  the  PRC  National \nCommittee for implementation of the UNCCD in the State Forestry Administration (SFA). \n \n6.  Building on the progress made by the partnership since 2002, the government requested \nTA support to prepare a new framework that will guide the implementation of future activities \nunder the partnership. ADB has served as the lead GEF agency for the partnership since 2002 \nand  has  provided  support  for  capacity  development  efforts  and  the  establishment  of \ncoordination  mechanisms.  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage  as  the  lead  GEF  agency  for  the \npartnership includes considerable experience with the identification, design, and implementation \nof TA and investment projects with the PRC as well as the ability to incorporate capacity \ndevelopment and TA into its projects. The government has also committed to allocating $4 \nmillion  from  the  land  degradation  focal  area  of  its  GEF-53 resources  and  commensurate \ndomestic funds to support the management and implementation of the renewed framework for \nSLM for dryland ecosystems.  \n \n7.  The TA aims to promote inclusive growth and environmental sustainability, and supports \nADB\u2019s strategic priorities in its country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC.4 The TA \nalso supports the PRC\u2019s sustainable development agenda for a harmonious society, as outlined \nin the country's Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015). In line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, climate \nchange and environmental sustainability are also key considerations of the TA design, including \ngreater  preparedness  for  extreme  weather  events  and  conservation  of  water  and  natural \nresources. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be improved productivity and inclusive growth in dryland regions. The \noutcome will be a 10-year development strategy for SLM for dryland ecosystems endorsed by \ngovernment. To attain the expected outcome, four outputs have been identified: (i) scope of \npartnership  development  strategy  (PDS)  identified,  (ii)  resource  mobilization  strategies  for \nimplementation  of  national  and  provincial  programs  under  the  PDS,  (iii)  institutional \narrangements enhanced for implementation of the PDS, and (iv) PDS prepared for the PRC\u2014\nGEF partnership on land degradation in dryland ecosystems for 2014\u20132023.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Scope  of  partnership  development  strategy  identified.  This  output \ninvolves carrying out an updated assessment of the current status of SLM in the PRC and future \nneeds. The TA will support (i) the preparation of a review report on (a) the status and scope of \nland degradation; (b) likely climate change impacts; and (c) biodiversity, poverty, gender, and \n                                                \n3   GEF-5 refers to the replenishment period covering 2010\u20132014. \n4   ADB. 2012.

Major activities for output 1 include the following: (i) review the results of phase 1 of the \npartnership, including establishment of baseline indicators for impact statement; (ii) conduct \nconsultation and participatory meetings and workshops with national and provincial agencies \nand  development  partners;  (iii)  survey  the  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  practices  of  local \nstakeholders  to  prepare  a  behavior-change  communication  strategy  and  combine  with  the \ndesign of the PDS; (iv) identify priority provinces and project areas for the strategy and program; \nand (v) prepare a review report on scope of land degradation, biodiversity, poverty, gender, and \nlivelihood issues in dryland ecosystems in the PRC and proposed strategy and program scope. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Resource  mobilization  strategies  endorsed  for  implementation  of \nnational and provincial programs under the partnership development strategy. SLM, at a \nscale required in the PRC, will require significant financial resources beyond what national, \nprovincial,  and  local  governments  can  provide.  The  TA  will  support  the  preparation  of  (i) \nresource mobilization strategies for accessing multiple funding sources prepared and endorsed \nat national and provincial levels, (ii) a strategy for public\u2013private partnerships and payment for \nenvironmental services prepared and endorsed to support implementation of the PDS, and (iii) \nprefeasibility studies completed for at least two priority projects under two of the provincial \nTwelfth Five-Year Plans (still to be determined). \n \n12.  Major activities for output 2 include the following: (i) work with the provinces to undertake \na process of criteria setting and prioritization for demonstration and investment projects and \ncapacity support activities; (ii) support the evaluation of the costing of provincial IEM SAPs and \npriority projects under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, and undertake consultations with central and \nprovincial governments and development partners on financial resource mobilization; (iii) assess \nopportunities for payment for environmental services and eco-compensation approaches to be \nused and scaled up under the program; (iv) identify opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships \nand prepare a private sector engagement strategy; (v) develop an overall financial resource \nmobilization strategy for the PDS and program, and design project and fund management \nmodels for the overall program and for priority projects; and (vi) identify a shortlist of high-priority \ninvestment projects and support prefeasibility assessments for at least two projects. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Institutional  arrangements  enhanced  for  implementation  of  the \npartnership development strategy. Effective coordination mechanisms have been promoted \nand established within the partnership, but there is a need to further institutionalize coordination \nand cooperation, especially at the national and interprovincial levels. Similarly, the large number \nof international organizations and national agencies involved in the partnership activities may \npose some challenges in the coordination and effective management of the program. The TA \nwill provide support to (i) strengthen the multisector and multilevel coordination framework for \nendorsement of the development strategy at the national and provincial levels, and (ii) integrate \nthe  development  strategy  and  program  with  the  national  implementation  and  reporting \nrequirements of the UNCCD. \n \n14.  Major activities for output 3 include the following: (i) assess current institutional and \ncoordination arrangements under phase 1 of the partnership, the UNCCD and other relevant \ninternational conventions; (ii) discuss and agree upon enhanced institutional arrangements and \n ", "4 \ncoordination  mechanisms  under  the  PDS;  and  (iii)  prepare  final  recommendations  on  the \nenhanced multisector and multilevel coordination arrangements for the PDS. \n \n15.  Output 4: Partnership development strategy prepared for the People's Republic of \nChina\u2013Global  Environment  Facility  partnership  on  land  degradation  in  dryland \necosystems for 2014\u20132023. The findings and recommendations gathered during the TA will be \nsummarized to form new strategic planning documents for the partnership including (i) the \ndevelopment strategy and program framework, with detailed results indicators agreed at the \ncentral  and  provincial  levels;  (ii)  a  draft  GEF  program  framework  document;  and  (iii)  a \nknowledge product that summarizes the strategic approach and policy recommendations in the \nPDS for public dissemination. \n \n16.  Major  activities  for  output  4  include  the  following:  (i)  design  a  results  framework, \nindicators, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements for the PDS and program; (ii) undertake \nparticipatory capacity needs assessment at central and provincial levels and prepare a targeted \ncapacity strengthening program to be integrated within the PDS; (iii) prepare a GEF program \nframework  document  based  on  consultation  with  the  MOF,  SFA,  target  provinces,  GEF \nagencies and secretariat, and other stakeholders; and (iv) prepare for public dissemination a \nknowledge product that summarizes the strategic approach and policy recommendations in the \nPDS. \n \n17.  No major risks related to implementation of the TA have been identified. The strong \nleadership, vision, and ownership by the MOF and SFA, as demonstrated over the last 10 years \nof the partnership, will ensure that a relevant and pragmatic development strategy is prepared. \nOne minor risk is that some sector agencies may lack incentives to actively participate in the \ndiscussions to develop a new multisector long-term strategy for the partnership. This risk will be \novercome  through  the  conduct  of  extensive  consultations  and  planning  meetings  with  the \ninvolved stakeholders at the national, provincial, and local levels to ensure that all sectors are \ncovered. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The proceeds of the \nTA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The government will provide support in the form of \ncounterpart staff and their travel and per diem, office facilities, meeting venues for workshop, \nand other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Implementation of the TA will take 15 months from 1 October 2012 to 31 December \n2013. The MOF will be the executing agency for the TA and the SFA will be the implementing \nagency. The TA will make use of the comprehensive coordination structure established for the \npartnership since 2002 at both central and provincial levels.5 At the central level, a steering \n                                                \n5  Institutional and organizational arrangements for the partnership were assessed during the preparation of TA \ncompletion report in 2010 for the TA 4358-PRC: Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation. The assessment \nacknowledged the significant project management capacity of the executing and implementing agencies. Unlike \nprevious GEF-supported grants, the recruitment of consultants for the proposed TA will be done by ADB, as \nrequested by the SFA. \n ", "5 \ncommittee has been established comprising representatives from the national legislative and \nconcerned ministries and agencies. A central project coordination office is established at the \nMOF, headed by the director general of the Department of International Cooperation, while the \ncentral project management office (CPMO) established in the SFA is headed by the deputy \ndirector general of the Department of Science and Technology. Through the CPMO, the SFA \nwill implement the TA and be responsible for day-to-day operational matters and implementation \nactivities.  The  SFA  will  administer  the  training,  seminars,  and  conferences,  for  which  an \nadvance payment facility will be established. The SFA has the capacity to manage the funds, as \nit has also implemented GEF grants. \n \n20.  The SFA will provide ADB with biannual progress reports during the implementation \nperiod, and a TA completion report within 3 months of the TA completion date. Provincial project \ncoordination offices and provincial project management offices have already been set up in \nGansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi provinces, and in the Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, and Xinjiang \nUygur  autonomous  regions,  each  headed  by  the  vice-governor  or  chair  in  charge  of  the \nagriculture  sector. In  addition,  specialized  task forces  on  legal  and  policy,  institutions  and \nplanning land degradation monitoring, and IEM have been established by the provinces to \nundertake project activities under the partnership. \n \n21.  The  SFA  will  be  supported  by  four  individual  consultants:  a  dryland  management \nspecialist and team leader (international, 5 person-months), a sustainable land management \nspecialist (national, 8 person-months), a financial specialist (national, 8 person-months), and a \nnatural  resources  management  and  institutional  expert  (national,  6  person-months).  The \nconsultants will be financed and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using the individual selection method. This \nmethod is considered appropriate and cost-effective given (i) the organizational structure has \nalready  been  established  for  the  partnership,  and  (ii)  the  size  of  the  TA.  The  terms  and \nconditions of the technical assistance framework agreement executed between the government \nand ADB dated 23 December 1996 apply to the ADB-financed consultants. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA. Best practices and lessons learned will be disseminated through national and \ninternational workshops and through various technical reports, knowledge products, and other \npublications posted on the websites of the partnership (http://www.gefop12.cn) and of ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Integrated Strategy for Sustainable \nLand Management in Dryland Ecosystems, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2022:    Assumptions \nImproved  Improved land productivity  Provincial annual  Provincial governments remain \nproductivity and  (net primary productivity  reports  committed to implementing the \ninclusive growth  and water use efficiency    integrated ecosystem management \nin dryland  improved from 2014 to  State Forestry  (IEM) strategic action plans (SAPs). \nregions  2023)  Administration (SFA)   \n(2012 baseline: to be  annual reports  The national government provides \ndetermined at early    adequate support.  \nimplementation stage)  United Nations   \n  Convention to Combat  Local stakeholders understand and \nImproved livelihoods in  Desertification  support SLM practices. \npoverty counties in target  (UNCCD) reports   \nprovinces from 2014 to  Improved livelihoods serve as an \nincentive for local stakeholders. \n2023 \n \n(2012 baseline: to be \nClimate change impacts are \ndetermined at early  predictable and adaptation is \nimplementation stage)  feasible. \n   \nIncreased investment in  Risk \nsustainable land  Human and financial resources are \nmanagement (SLM) and  inadequate. \nbiodiversity conservation \ncompared from 2014 to \n2023 \n(2012 baseline: to be \ndetermined at early \nimplementation stage) \nOutcome  By 2014:    Assumptions \nA 10-year  Development strategy and  Project technical and  Sufficient human and financial \ndevelopment  program framework for  progress reports  resources can be mobilized on time \nstrategy for  2014\u20132023 prepared and    by the national and provincial \nSLM for dryland  endorsed  Annual reports from  governments. \necosystems  (2012 baseline: none)  the Ministry of   \nendorsed by    Finance (MOF), SFA,  Ongoing interest from development \ngovernment  Financial mechanisms  and provincial  partners, such as the Global \nestablished to support  governments  Environment Facility (GEF), to \nimplementation of the    support the objectives of the \ndevelopment strategy   program.  \n(2012 baseline: none)   \n  Risk \nEnhanced multisector and  Government agencies are reluctant \nmultilevel coordination and  to contribute to implementing \ninstitutional arrangements  multisector approaches. \nestablished and endorsed \n(2012 baseline: none) \nOutputs  By 2014:    Assumptions \n1.
