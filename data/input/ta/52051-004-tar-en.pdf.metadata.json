The proposed project will improve the productivity and sustainability of water resources \nmanagement in the Kurram river basin, and will improve agricultural productivity, through: (i) \nconstruction of a multipurpose dam with a 98-meter height, (ii) construction and upgrading of \nirrigation canals, (iii) construction of a hydropower generation station, (iv) construction of on-farm \nwater courses and providing agricultural support, and (v) institutional capacity strengthening for \nefficient water management and sustainability of infrastructures. The dam will also help flood \nmanagement. The project will improve about 140,000 ha land through improved or new irrigation \nsystems. The project will also construct or upgrade farm roads to improve access to  markets and \nimprove the community facilities, such as school, basic health unit and water supply, to improve \nlivelihoods  of  local  population  who  will  be  affected  by  involuntary resettlement  due  to the \nconstruction of infrastructures. The dam will be located on the Kurram River, previously Northern \nWaziristan Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and currently in Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Province (KP). The proposed project will be aligned with the following impact: \nimproved water, food and energy security. Stage 1 construction work1 is in progress, which will \ndivert a part of flow from the neighboring Kaitu River into the proposed Kurram dam reservoir. \n \n2.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $800  million.  For  the  ensuing  investment,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance $300 million from its ordinary capital resources and the \ngovernment will contribute $75 million. The balance amount of $425 million is expected to be \nfinanced by cofinanciers. The ensuing loan was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2020\u20132022.2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help the government prepare the project \nfully  that  meets  the  donors\u2019  requirement  for  funding.  It  will  also  help  prepare  institutional \ndevelopment plans for operational management of reservoir and power houses, on-farm water \nand agriculture management and irrigation supplies monitoring and control mechanisms vis-\u00e0-vis \ncapacity development program for the new institution. The past preparatory works included the \ngovernment-funded feasibility study in 2004 and a detailed engineering design in 2011. The \noutputs of these studies were subjected to a comprehensive due diligence review funded by the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  in  2013.  The  USAID  review \nrevealed several serious design flaws, including possible underrating of key design parameters, \nsuch as probable maximum flood discharge and design seismic force, as well as inadequacy of \ngeological information. The past studies also lacked design and planning for irrigation and \nagricultural development in sufficient detail.  \n \n4.  The small-scale knowledge and support technical assistance3 approved in 2018 identified \nfurther gaps in the past studies: (i) impact of climate change was not assessed and was not \nincorporated in the other relevant assessments (hydrology, sediment, flood, agriculture etc.); (ii) \nagriculture and command area development was not fully covered; (iii) topographic surveys and \n \n1   This is financed by the Government of Pakistan and United States for International Development with the overall \ncost of PKR21 billion.  \n2  ADB. 2019.

Manila.  \n ", "2 \ngeotechnical investigations were not carried out in sufficient detail; (iv) impact of Baran dam \nraising that is planned downstream of the Kurram River was not discussed; and (v) safeguard \ndocuments  were  not  properly  prepared.  The  TRTA  team  confirmed  the  shortcomings  and \nemphasized the need for development of a fully integrated project, where water integrates and \nlinks the people, land and environment for the sustainable services. The proposed TRTA will \nenable a comprehensive feasibility study to validate technical feasibility and economic viability of \nthe project, applying best international practice in planning and design of dams, along with \nplanning and layout design of irrigation and agricultural development component, as well as \nupdating and strengthening of environmental and social due diligence works. It will be ensured \nthat lessons learned under ADB-assisted projects are comprehensively addressed as part of the \nTRTA outputs.4 With the result of the due diligence, TRTA will develop an integrated water \nresources management focused project design. Subsequently the TRTA will also develop a \nholistic plan for the entire scheme and explore cofinancing opportunities with other development \npartners and the private sector.  \n \n5.  To  advance  the  project  readiness,  the  government  intends  to  seek  ADB\u2019s  Project \nReadiness Financing (PRF), amounting to some $5 million. The Water and Power Development \nAuthority  (WAPDA) will undertake the detailed design of the dam and appurtenant structures and \nprocurement preparation under the PRF. Bidding document preparation, procurement support \nand other project readiness activities will also be covered by the PRF. The PRF will also support \na panel of experts to advise on and review the criteria, assumptions, and standard practices in \nthe design of dams, spillways, tunnels and associated energy dissipating arrangements to ensure \nsafety, integrity and operational reliability of the structures.  \n \nB.

Output 3\u2014Comprehensive Agricultural Development and Irrigation Management \nImprovement Plan Developed. The activities will include: (i) comprehensive analysis of the \nagricultural,  socioeconomic,  demographic,  agro-climatic,  and  infrastructural  development \nconditions of the project\u2019s command area and the farming communities within; (ii) development \nof credible and robust agricultural development scenario that capitalizes on the increased and \nmore reliable supply of irrigation service; (iii) formulation of an agricultural development plan, \nidentifying prevailing and likely future challenges and constraints to the realization of agricultural \ndevelopment  scenarios,  and  the  measures  that  would  address  such  constraints,  including \nimprovement  in  agricultural  extension  services,  promotion  of  local  knowledges,  and \nempowerment of small farmers; (iv) study of the prevailing irrigation and water management \npractices and underlying sociopolitical conditions in the existing irrigation command areas, and \nidentification of necessary improvements in the management practices and water management \ninstitutions for more efficient and equitable distribution and use of irrigation water, with specific \nattention to the results under the 1997 irrigation sector reform;6 and (v) formulation of an \ninstitutional development and capacity building plan for more efficient, sustainable and equitable \nirrigation services for the irrigation department and farmers/water user groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $1.8 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u20136).  The  Government  will \ncontribute  $300,000  in  kind  as  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space  for  TRTA \nconsultants,  counterpart  staff,  data  and  information  access,  security  arrangements,  and \nfacilitation of liaisons with stakeholders during the feasibility study. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1. The government was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n5 The PRF scope will include confirmatory, supplementary and additional surveys for the purpose of detail design.     \n6 For example, empowered Farmer Organizations resulted in increased rent seeking within water users, reduced \ncollection of irrigation service fee, and increased inequity in distribution of irrigation water.

Kurram  Tangi  Integrated  Water  Resources  Development  Project  (the  Project)  was \nconceived as the second phase of Kurram Tangi Dam Project.8 The project concept and design \nwere developed through a feasibility study in 2004 and an engineering design in 2011, both \nsponsored by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). Main project components \nincluded a 98-meter-high concrete faced rockfill dam located across the Kurram River in North \nWaziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, three hydroelectric powerhouses with combined \ninstalled  capacity  of  65MW,  two  diversion  weirs,  construction  of  Thal  irrigation  canal  and \nremodeling of the existing Civil/Kankot and Marwat/Right Bank irrigation canals. Combined, these \ncanals were envisaged to cover a total cultivable command area of 140,000 ha. \n \n2.  In 2013, a due diligence review of the project design was carried out by the United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID). The review identified a number of concerns over \nthe possible under-rating of key design parameters, such as probable maximum flood, design \nseismic  force,  and  sediment  yield.  In  addition,  it  also  pointed  out  the  lack  of  site-specific \ntopographic and geotechnical data and information on several key components, such as saddle \ndam. Support is also required to develop an integrated water resources management plan and \nholistic investment plan for preparing a proposed ADB-financed project, co-financed by other \ndevelopment partners and private sector.  \n \nII.  Objective of the Assignment \n \n3.  The objective of the assignment is to validate the feasibility and viability of the project, \nthrough necessary updating and modification of the project  design, based on the updated \ntopographic and geotechnical information, as well as the updated design criteria and parameters, \nin compliance with best international practice recommended by the internationally recognized \ncredible  authorities  and  organizations. 9 The  tasks  also  includes  safeguard  due  diligence, \neconomic and financial, institutional assessment, risk assessment, and other due diligences to \nmeet requirements of ADB and the government to be processed as an ADB financing project. \nWith the results of due diligences, the TA consultant team will develop a proposal of integrated \nproject design to aims at integrated water resources management, and assist the ADB team to \nplan and explore co-financing opportunities with other development partners and a private sector \nby providing necessary information and documents. \n \n4.  The government plans to request ADB\u2019s Project Readiness Financing (PRF) amounting \nto $5 million to prepare detailed engineering design of the dam and its appurtenance structures, \npower  houses,  procurement  preparation  and  other  project  readiness  activities.  A  separate \nconsultant team what will be engaged by WAPDA will provide services for the PRF. Detailed \nengineering design of the irrigation structures will also be separately conducted by the KP \ngovernment.  \n \n \nIII.  Scope of Work  \n \n8  The first stage included construction of a weir across the Kaitu river, construction of Sheratalla and Spaira Ragha \nirrigation canals, a feeder tunnel to augment Kurram Tangi reservoir, and two power houses with combined installed \ncapacity of 18.9MW. The first stage project is under implementation. \n9  Such as the International Commission on Large Dams, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the United \nStates Bureau of Reclamation for dam, and any other credible authorities and organizations. \n ", " \nPreparing the Kurram Tangi Integrated Water Resources Development Project (TRTA PAK 52051) \n \n \nA.  Survey and Investigation \n \n(1) Topographic Survey and GIS Information \na.  Review the available topographic survey data and maps produced during the earlier \nstudies, and perform the following:  \n\u2022  preliminary topographic map covering the reservoir surface area, dam, saddle, \nspillway, weirs, headrace power and diversion tunnels, forebays, power houses, \nand tailrace;  \n\u2022  Thal  Canal,  distributaries  and  minor  mapping  through  acquisition  of  satellite \nimages, marking of Thal irrigation system as proposed in previous studies, and \nalternate alignment options, if required and proposed by GoKP.

Rectification \nof the satellite image through CPs, and generating topography maps;  \n\u2022  access road mapping through acquisition of fresh high-resolution satellite images \nfor marking of road alignment; \n\u2022  GIS mapping of existing Civil/Kankot and Marwat/Right Bank irrigation canals \ncommand area; \n\u2022  Civil/Kankot and Marwat/Right Bank irrigation canals, distributaries and minors \nplan/profile, inventory and condition surveys;  \nb.  Engage qualified national survey and investigation service provider subcontracted \nunder the consultancy contract as approved by WAPDA and ADB and carry out the \nnecessary survey as identified in (a) above.  \n \n(2) Geotechnical Investigation and Analyses \na.  Review the available geotechnical data and information collected during the earlier \nstudies, identify and carry out additional investigation and testing needs, including: \n\u2022  areal geological map over the reservoir area, identifying faults, joints, stratigraphy, \nand  other  significant  geological  features  that  indicate  high  reservoir  leakage \npotential, potential land slide areas around the reservoir rim, and potential borrow \nand quarry areas and source of construction materials; and \n\u2022  Site-specific geotechnical mapping over the proposed sites for saddle dam and \npotential borrow and quarry areas; and \nb.  Carry out exploratory drilling, along with laboratory testing of samples and in-situ \ntesting as necessary, including the proposed sites for saddle dam, spillway, diversion \nand power tunnels, weir II, penstock for power house III, and along the proposed and \nexisting irrigation canals with appropriate distances sufficient to allow geotechnical \nassessment for feasibility level design. \nc.

Prepare  a  geotechnical  investigation  report  summarizing  the  major  findings  of \ninvestigation,  and  recommendation  for  further  investigation  prior  to  detailed \nengineering design. \n \nB.  Updating Feasibility Study \n(1) Hydrological Study \na.  Hydrological data analysis  \n \n ", "    1 \n\u2022  Collect and review hydrological data and analysis of the past studies, and identify \nand carry out additional data assessment and analysis required for comprehensive \nfeasibility level design of the project facilities; \n\u2022  Review and analyze the water resources development planning documents in the \nAfghan side of the upstream catchment, which are to be provided by the client, \nasses the likely impacts on the river flows and sediment yield, and incorporate the \nanticipated impacts in the project planning and design; \n\u2022  Re-estimate  the  probable  maximum  precipitation  that  is  most  credible  in \naccordance with best international practice, calculate probable maximum flood \ndischarges at the dam site using an appropriate runoff simulation model, and \ndevelop an inflow design flood hydrograph for design of spillway; \n\u2022  Review and revise as necessary the construction diversion flood to ensure that the \nhydrological analysis and the selection of design return period both reflect the best \ninternational practice; \n\u2022  Review and analyze the past sediment studies and re-establish most credible \ndesign parameters, such as particle size distribution and annual sediment yield; and \n\u2022  Review and validate observed and synthesized discharge data used by the past \nstudies and produce 10-daily discharge data at the reservoir site over a period \nbetween 1971 and 2018. \n \nb.  Sedimentation study  \n\u2022  Carry out sediment study using appropriate approach and available data. It is \nexpected  that  enough  data  may  not  be  available  for  tradition  probabilistic  or \nstatistical approach to determine the sediment yields at reservoir inlet. Therefore, \nusing appropriate sediment flow and deposition model may be used to assess the \ntotal sediment inflow, deposition pattern, and change in reservoir capacity with time \nincluding impact of flushing as well as changes in catchment.
