INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Sri Lanka has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nsupport the modernization of the plantation sector via the issuance of \u201ctea bonds\u201d (offshore US \ndollar bonds) that would fund capital expenditures for plantations\u2019 tea and rubber production and \nimprove the access of Sri Lankan issuers to international capital markets. The government also \nrequested ADB to formulate a plan for a venture capital fund for small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs).1 These  requests  are  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2015\u20132016 for Sri Lanka,2 for they focus on one of its three pillars: catalyzing private \ninvestment and enhancing the effectiveness of public investment. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth was over 8% during 2010\u20132012, when it reached middle-\nincome  status  as  classified  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  Weak  external  demand \ncombined with the lag effect of monetary tightening in the previous year slowed growth to 3.4% \nin 2013, but improved tourism and exports helped the economy recover to 4.9% in 2014; in \n2015, growth in Sri Lanka\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) was 4.8%.4 To sustain growth, Sri \nLanka  must  enhance  the  productivity  and  global  competitiveness  of  its  export-oriented \nindustries through increased capital investment for operational efficiency and innovation. Given \nthe limited fiscal space of the government (with a 7.2% fiscal deficit and a 73.5% debt-to-GDP \nratio in 2015), private sector investment should be especially encouraged. This is affirmed by \nthe Economic Policy Statement delivered by the Prime Minister in 2015, which targets increased \nincome by encouraging foreign investment and investment by individuals.5 \n \n3.  To support investment and economic growth, resources would ideally be provided from a \nvibrant capital market. However, the financial market in Sri Lanka is dominated by banks. \nMeasures  of  capital  market  depth  in  relation  to  GDP,  such  as  stock  market  capitalization \n(28.4%), outstanding domestic private debt securities (0.9%), and outstanding government debt \nsecurities (41.8%), indicate a need for further development.6  \n \n4.  Sri Lanka tea and rubber exports play a key role in the Sri Lankan economy. In 2015, Sri \nLanka tea exports surpassed $1.3 billion in foreign exchange earnings, which accounted for \n12.8% of exports and about 1.6% of GDP. Around 10% of the population is dependent on the \n                                                 \n1  In the 2016 budget speech delivered by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, the Government of Sri Lanka stated \nthat it will initiate a venture capital \u201cFund of Funds\u201d with the participation of financial institutions as shareholders \n(Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance. 2015. Budget Speech\u20142016. http://www.treasury.gov.lk/images/ \ndepts/fpd/docs/budgetspeech/2016/bgtspeech2016E.pdf). ADB is also invited to contribute to the fund. The fund \nwill lend to responsible venture capital firms for a guaranteed minimum rate of return, and the venture capital firms \nwill make equity investments in the SMEs. Subsequent to the budget speech, the government requested ADB to \nstudy the feasibility of establishing an SME venture capital fund (Supplementary Appendix A). \n2  ADB. 2015.

Colombo. \n ", "2   \nindustry, which employs 2 million workers directly and indirectly.7 Rubber is a similarly important \ncomponent of the plantation sector and earns approximately 60% of tea\u2019s export earnings. A \nfinancing gap is expected for regional plantation companies (RPCs) as they plan to modernize \ntheir  facilities  and  to  invest  in  research  and  development  and  marketing  for  value-added \nproducts to meet the new and changing needs of the global market.8 However, the government \nbudget is too constrained to provide subsidized loans or bank guarantees as it has done in the \npast, and traditional commercial bank loans are costly and too short in maturity to match the \nenvisaged long-term capital investments. \n \n5.  SMEs, which are responsible for 30% of the country\u2019s GDP, are critical for Sri Lanka\u2019s \neconomic growth. SMEs are especially important for poverty reduction, as they provide 35% of \nemployment.9 Despite their importance, SMEs struggle to access financing. In January 2016, \nADB approved a $100 million line of credit to SMEs to improve their access to medium-term \ndebt financing, and the attached technical assistance (TA) will assess the feasibility of an SME \ncredit guarantee facility.10 Although these interventions address debt financing, equity capital is \nstill a constraint on SMEs. The venture capital industry is in a nascent stage, with only 0.1% of \ntotal assets in the financial system of Sri Lanka in 2014.11 This is partly due to a lack of risk \nmanagement expertise and insufficient funding from long-term strategic investors for further \ngrowth.12 \n \n6.   This TA aims to mobilize domestic and international private investment for two of Sri \nLanka\u2019s  important  drivers  for  inclusive  growth\u2014plantations  and  SMEs\u2014through  innovative \nfinancial  solutions.  Thereby,  capital  markets  will  be  developed, 13  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestment encouraged, and fiscal space created. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be increased foreign investment and investment by individuals, aligned \nwith the Economic Policy Statement of the government  (footnote 5). The outcome will be \nstrengthened ability of RPCs and SMEs to access private investment from capital markets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The three TA outputs will support the TA outcome. Output 1 will be a study on the \nfeasibility of tea bonds issued by RPCs and partially guaranteed by ADB for the modernization \nand expansion of their operations. The TA will assess the RPCs\u2019 medium- and long-term capital \n                                                 \n7  Sri  Lanka  Tea  Board.  2015.  Tea  Market  Update.  Colombo.

Any initial \nfindings from this TA may be proposed for inclusion in the capital markets reform program. \n ", "3 \n \nrequirements and financing options, including the tea bonds. The tea bonds would have a \nnatural partial foreign currency hedge because RPCs have sufficient future revenue flows linked \nto hard currencies. Output 2 will undertake due diligence for the operationalization of an SME \nventure capital fund to increase SMEs\u2019 access to equity capital. This is complementary to ADB\u2019s \nongoing SME credit line (footnote 10). A final report that analyzes the demand, business model, \nfund ownership, and corporate governance of the SME venture capital fund will be submitted to \nthe government for endorsement. For both tea bonds and the SME venture capital fund, the \nimpact of government financial assistance on the national budget will be reviewed and taken \ninto account for the structuring options to enhance strategic budgeting. Output 3 will support \nknowledge  building.  Since  both  the  tea  bond  and  the  SME  venture  capital  fund  are  new \nconcepts  to  the  public  and  private  sectors  in  Sri  Lanka,  this  output  will  educate  relevant \nstakeholders on these new financing instruments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $510,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund and administered by \nADB.14 The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The TA will be administered by ADB. The executing agency for the tea bonds is the \nMinistry of Plantation Industries (MPI), while that for the SME venture capital fund is the Ministry \nof  Finance\u2019s  Department  of  Development  Finance.  The  SME  venture  capital  fund  will  be \nimplemented in consultation with a steering committee established under the SME credit line \n(footnote 10), whose members include the secretary to the treasury (chair), Department of \nDevelopment Finance, ADB, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Export Development Board, Federation \nof Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka, and others that may be considered \nappropriate by the government. The TA will be implemented from July 2016 to March 2017. \n \n11.  The TA will require 9 person-months of international consulting services and 9 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. A consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Due to \nthe highly specialized expertise needed, an international consulting firm in association with \nnational consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with a quality\u2013cost weighting of 90:10. An output-based (lump-sum) contract \nwill be used. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. All the \ndisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n12.  The  progress  of  the  TA  project  will  be  discussed  with  the  government  and  other \nstakeholders on a regular basis. The consultants\u2019 reports are to be shared with government \nofficials  and  market  participants  through  periodic  meetings,  dissemination  seminars,  and \nworkshops, which are expected deliverables for output 3. \n \n                                                 \n14 Established by ADB.
