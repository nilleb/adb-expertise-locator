During the Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nPakistan in November 1996, the Government requested ADB assistance to develop a program \nto promote industrial environmental improvement.  A fact-finding mission in November 1997 and \na follow-up mission in April 1998 visited Pakistan to formulate the technical assistance program \n(the Program) and reached an understanding on the terms of reference of consultants, cost \nestimates, and implementation arrangements.1 The processing of the technical assistance (TA) \nhalted following developments in May 1998 suspending new assistance from international \nfinancial institutions.  Processing resumed in July 1999 and the Government endorsed the TA in \nJune 2001.  The TA amount was subsequently decreased from $1.5 million to $700,000 in the \n2002 Pakistan Country Program.  A consultation mission was fielded in September 20012 to \nrevise the scope of the TA.  The revised TA paper was endorsed by the Government in August \n2002. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A significant portion of the environmental problems in Pakistan\u2019s major cities is caused \nby industrial pollution. Industrial wastewater is one of the main sources of waterborne pollution \nin  most  rivers  and  lakes  in  urban  Pakistan.  Only  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  industrial \nwastewater discharged, most of which contains hazardous and toxic materials, is treated. The \nresulting impacts on human health and the environment have been severe.  The Pakistan \nHuman Rights Commission in its 1998 report pointed out that apart from the impact on human \nhealth and lives, environmental degradation costs the country's economy $1.65 billion that year \nalone.  These concerns highlight the importance of designing programs in Pakistan that can \neffectively  address  industrial  pollution  and  facilitate  the  efficient  management  of  their \nenvironmental effects on a sustainable basis. \n  \n3.  The establishment of environmental policies and regulations in Pakistan began in 1975 \nwhen the Environment and Urban Affairs Division (EUAD) was established in the Ministry of \nHousing  and  Works.  EUAD  was  instrumental  in  promulgating  the  landmark  Pakistan \nEnvironmental Protection Ordinance of 1983, which provided a legal framework for national \nenvironmental management and established the national environmental quality standards that \nset limits for emissions and discharges.  The Pakistan Environmental Protection Ordinance also \ncalled for the establishment of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK EPA) and \nthe four Provincial Environmental Protection Agencies (PEPAs).  In 1984, the Government \nestablished the Pakistan Environmental Protection Council as the top national policy-making \nand coordinating body3 consisting of the Prime Minister of Pakistan as the chairperson, the \nfederal minister of environment, the chief ministers of the four provinces, and the secretary to \nthe ministry of environment.  In 1994, the Government upgraded EUAD to the full-fledged \nMinistry of Environment and Urban Affairs, headed by the Prime Minister.  In November 1996, it \nwas redesignated as the Ministry of Environment, Local Government, and Rural Development \n(MELG&RD). The main function of MELG&RD is to ensure that environmental considerations \nand concerns of sustainable development are incorporated into national development plans and \npolicies.  PAK EPA is within the environmental wing of MELG&RD and is charged with enforcing \nnational  environmental  quality  standards4  and  other  initiatives  to  regulate  environmental \nmanagement.  The organizational structure of the federal and provincial EPAs are similar.  A \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 1997. \n2  The Mission consisted of Samuel Tumiwa, Renewable Energy Specialist, West Energy Division (IWEN) \n3  Although the council did not have its first meeting until 1993. \n4  However, the  PEPAs were not established until 1997. ", "2 \ndirector general heads PAK EPA and each PEPA and is assisted by directors, deputy directors, \nand/or assistant directors responsible for specific areas of environmental management. Through \nPAK EPA\u2019s efforts, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act was passed by Parliament on 11 \nSeptember 1997. The Act provides a strong foundation for PAK EPA to handle pollution-related \nproblems as well as hazardous and toxic waste. More recently, the Government finalized \nseveral draft guidelines for industry to undertake self-monitoring and reporting procedures.  \n \n4.  However, environmental management in Pakistan remains relatively weak because of \nfinancial and resource constraints.  To strengthen industrial environmental management, the \nProgram will: (i) assist the government in developing a policy framework for improving industrial \nenvironmental  management;  (ii)  provide  recommendations  for  strengthening  the  technical \ncapabilities and institutional capacity of the various governmental agencies in implementing their \npolicy mandates; and (iii) assess specific investments that need to be made to support the \npolicies, and (iv) establish a line of credit for private sector investments in clean technologies \nand  environmental  management.  The  TA  will  result  in  rationalized  policies,  strengthened \ninstitutional capacity, increased technical capabilities, and improved infrastructure and financing \nto  address  industrial  environmental  pollution.    In  addition,  it  will  increase  industrial \ncompetitiveness by improving process efficiency, lowering the per-unit cost of production, and \npromoting export competitiveness.5  Other funding agencies have also been active in promoting \nindustrial  environmental  management.    Currently,  both  the  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation \n(NORAD) have ongoing projects to promote industrial environmental management in several \nindustry sectors.  In addition the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry \n(FPCCI) has an active program to promote improved industrial environmental management \nwithin its membership.  The organizations strongly welcome ADB\u2019s timely assistance to the \nGovernment  and  support  the  undertaking  of  the  proposed  Industrial  Environmental \nManagement Program.  The Program is also in line with ADB's Country Strategy and Program \nfor Pakistan, which seeks to support sustainable growth and the private sector. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The Program will assist the Government in formulating an Industrial Environmental \nManagement Program, combining policy and institutional reforms, and capacity building with a \ndetailed action plan, an investment package that includes specific environmental investments, \nand a line of credit for the sub-project, and institutional capacity building.  The framework is \nattached as Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The  Program  will  target  improved  energy  efficiency  and  industrial  environmental \nmanagement  for  sectors  with  high  effluent  discharge.    This  will  be  achieved  through  a \ncombination of approaches that are \"sector based\" (i.e., targeting specific sectors that are highly \npolluting in their wastewater - potentially, the leather and textile industries) and  \"place-based\" \n(i.e., identifying geographic areas with high concentrations of leather and textile industries).  \n                                                 \n5 This will help support the Government\u2019s implementation of the Trade, Export Promotion, and Industry Program \n(TEPI) policy agenda under ADB.2001. Trade, Export Promotion and Industry Program (for $300 million). Manila. \napproved on 13 March 1999.    ", "    3 \nFurther,  the  Program  will  have  a  two-pronged  strategy  to  promote  energy  efficiency  and \nimproved environmental management during product processing (i.e., cleaner production6) and \nat the \"end-of-pipe\"7 by: (i) developing policies8 that will require factories in the identified \ngeographic area to treat their waste water (with energy efficient processes); and (ii) develop \nmarket-based  incentives9  to  encourage  industry  to  make  investments  to  improve  their \nenvironmental  performance.  The  Program  will  have  three  major  components:    (i)  policy \nformulation,  (ii)  needs  assessment  for  capacity  building,  and  (iii)  needs  assessment  for \nenvironmental investments.  ADB will be supporting the policy formulation and investment \nneeds assessment through this TA but only the preliminary analysis for the capacity building \nneeds assessment.  The recommendations that will result from the capacity building component \nwill be implemented in a separate TA.10 \n \n7.  Component 1  will formulate a program for policy reform for industrial efficiency and \nenvironmental management and outline a policy framework matrix and action plan that will be \nimplemented by the government.  It will include three sub components: (i) review current \npolicies for promoting energy efficiency and improved industrial environmental management, \nevaluate  their  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  recommend  a  policy  matrix  for  providing \nincentives for encouraging the facilities in selected areas to invest in cleaner processes and \ntechnologies and treat their wastewater; (ii) establish industry benchmarks by selecting industry \nsectors that are responsible for the largest percentage of water pollution, identifying the current \nbaseline of energy efficiency and water pollution in the selected industry sectors; identify \nbenchmarks of industry best practices of corresponding sectors in the region and worldwide; \nand developing realistic targets for the selected industries; and (iii) recommend a system for \nmonitoring and evaluating industrial environmental performance. \n \n8.  Component 2, the TA will assess the existing institutional framework for industrial \nenvironmental management and make recommend ways to increase capacity.  It will include (i) \nreviewing the Government\u2019s existing environmental management structure and providing an \nassessment of the effectiveness of the institutional capacity of the existing environmental \nagencies with regard to their current and projected role; (ii) outlining resource and capacity \nconstraints  and  other  causes  of  institutional  inefficiencies  in  the  environment  sector  and \ndeveloping a comprehensive report of institutional and technical needs; (iii) recommending a \nmodel  for  restructuring  the  agencies  in  the  environmental  sector;  (iv)  providing  estimated \nincremental costs of environmental management, which should include financial and budgetary \nrequirements; (v) recommending an outreach and awareness raising program for industry and \nfinancial institutions on improved industrial environmental management; and (vi) providing a \n                                                 \n6 Cleaner Production refers to the reduction or elimination of pollution at the source (source reduction) instead of at \nthe end-of-the-pipe or stack. Pollution prevention occurs when raw materials, water, energy, and other resources \nare utilized more efficiently, when less harmful substances are substituted for hazardous ones, and when toxic \nsubstances are eliminated from the production process. \n7 \u201cEnd-of-pipe\u201d treatment refers to technologies and processes used to treat pollution at the end of the production \nprocess and before it is released to the environment such as waste treatment plants for water or electrostatic \nprecipitators or filters for smoke stacks. \n8 This could include, but not be limited to, special permitting conditions; industrial zoning, substance/ product/ \ntechnology ban\u2019 discharge standards and charges, etc. \n9 This could include, but not be limited to, reduced taxes, duties and fees; removal of harmful subsidies; soft and \nrevolving loans for cleaner production investments; facilitation and preparation of bankable loans; tradable permits, \ngrants and subsidies for cleaner production assessment and implementation, etc \n10 NORAD co-financing is expected by October 2002 and will be administered by ADB on an untied basis to finance a \nseparate TA.  The TAs will be sequential so the new TA will implement the recommendations for capacity building \noutlined in Component 2.  Engagement of additional consultants under the separate TA will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and procurement of equipment will be undertaken in procedures \nacceptable to ADB. ", "4 \nreport outlining the resources necessary to continue the development and promotion of the \nnational environmental quality standards (NEQS) , self-monitoring and reporting tool (SMART) \nand environmental management information system (EMIS). \n \n9.  Component 3 will formulate a needs assessment for investments for improved energy \nefficiency  and  environmental  management.    It  will  comprise  three  sub  components:    (i) \nIdentifying specific geographic areas in each province where there are clusters of high effluent \ndischarging industries (i.e., leather, textile, and chemical facilities) that would be conducive to \nestablishing  common  effluent  treatment  plant  (CETPs)  and  conducting  an  assessment  for \nestablishing  CETPs,  including  technical,  economic,  and  financial  viability;  identifying  any \nexisting entities, and if necessary, proposing the establishment of new entities, to own and \noperate the CETPs, developing a business plan to ensure that the CETPs are self-sustaining, \nincluding establishing a fee and collection structure, identifying potential sites for CETP, and \nconducting  the  necessary  environmental  and  social  impact  studies;  (ii)  identifying  specific \nenergy  and  process  efficiency  investments  that  the  selected  industry  sectors  should  be \nconsidering in order to improve process efficiency and environmental performance, identifying \nspecific companies that require and are interested in capital for investment, and conducting the \nnecessary assessments for the investments; and (iii) identifying financial intermediaries that are \ninterested in, and able to, on-lend to companies interested in investing in improved processes \nand technologies, and conducting the assessments necessary for establishing such a facility. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $840,000  equivalent,  comprising  about                \n$465,000 in foreign exchange and about $375,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The cost \nestimates are presented in Appendix 2.  ADB will provide $700,000, comprising $465,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $235,000 equivalent of local currency cost.  The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  The Government will finance the remaining \n$140,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  PAK EPA will be the Executing Agency of the TA. A project management unit (PMU) \nwithin PAK EPA, headed by the director general, will be the focal point of the TA and will be \nresponsible for coordinating the consulting firms and the steering committees.  Five high-level \nsteering committees will be constituted to optimize effective participation, coordination, and \nimplementation of the TA among the concerned agencies of the federal and provincial levels, \nand other stakeholders, (including representatives from Federation of Pakistani Chambers of \nCommerce and Industry [FPCCI], non\u2013government organizations [NGOs], and other concerned \ncitizens).  One will be at the federal level in Islamabad and one each will be at the provincial \nlevels in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta. \n \n12.  The secretary, MELG&RD will be the chairperson of the federal steering committee in \nIslamabad.  Its  members  will  include  the  Planning  and  Development  Division,  Ministry  of \nIndustry,  and  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power,  provincial  environment \nsecretaries and/or directors general of PEPAs, and FPCCI since the participation of these \nministries and agencies will be crucial in ensuring support for implementation.  In addition, the \nsteering committee may include members from other agencies such the Board of Investments, \nMinistry of Science and Technology, other industry associations, and relevant NGOs.  The \nfederal steering committee will be responsible for inter agency coordination, providing the \nstrategic direction for the TA, and for reviewing and providing final approval of all the draft ", "    5 \nreports of the TA.  The provincial steering committees will be chaired by the environment \nsecretaries  or  directors  general  of  PEPAs,  (state  secretary  for  industry,  state  board  of \ninvestment) and the members will represent the concerned departments or offices and the \nprovincial  FPCCI.  In  recognition  of  the  important  role  of  FPCCI  (as  the  apex  industry \nassociation) in this TA, FPCCI may organize working groups within its own structure that will \ninclude the relevant industry sub sectors.  FPCCI representatives in the federal and provincial \nsteering committees will represent their views. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  commence  in  December  2002,  be  carried  out  over  9  months  by \ninternationally recognized consulting firms/institutes in association with domestic consultants, \nand will be completed by August 2003. The total input of international and domestic consultant \nservices will be about 17 and 46 person-months, respectively. ADB will divide the required \nconsulting services into two parts, to be implemented concurrently.  The bifurcation of the TA \ninto two parts is possible because each has a completely different focus and therefore, different \nskill sets will be required for each part. The bifurcation of the contracts will expedite TA \nimplementation. Part A of the TA will be to conduct components 1 (policy formulation) and 2 \n(needs assessment for capacity building) and will involve 7 person-months of international and \n10 person-months of domestic consultant services. The consultants for part A will also be \nrequired to compile the final report that will include the findings of parts A and B.  The \nconsultants must have relevant experience in industrial and environmental policy development, \nespecially on the use of market-based incentives, and institutional capacity building.  Part B will \nbe to conduct Component 3 (needs assessment for investments) and will involve 10 person-\nmonths of international and 36 person-months of domestic consultant services.  The consultants \nwill be expected to have relevant experience in conducting economic and financial analyses of \nindustrial  efficiency  and  environmental  management  investments  as  well  as  the  required \nenvironmental and social assessment. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services \nfor parts A and B are presented in Appendix 3.  ADB will use simplified technical proposals and \nquality- and cost-based selection methods for consultant selection.  Consultants will be selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of Pakistan for Industrial Environmental Management, and hereby reports this  \naction to the Board.", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nSustainable long-term  Promote industrial  Policy dialogue with \neconomic growth.  efficiency and sustainable   concerned government \n  industrial environmental  agencies, review mission, \n  management.  and periodic reports. \n \nPurpose       \nAssist the Government in  A policy matrix and  Policy dialogue, review  Continued commitment by the \nformulating an industrial  sequenced action plan for  missions, and periodic  federal and provincial \nenvironmental  introducing market-based  reports.  governments to adopt market-\nmanagement program  incentives for industrial  based incentives in tandem with \ncombining policy and  efficiency and  improved regulations, and the \ninstitutional reforms with a  environmental  financing institution\u2019s \ndetailed action plan, an  management, an  earnestness for improved  \ninvestment package that  investment plan for  environmental management. \nincludes specific  establishing common \nenvironmental  effluent treatment plants \ninvestments, and a line of  (CETPs) for high effluent \ncredit for the sub project,  industries, a feasibility \nand institutional capacity  study for establishing a \nbuilding.   line of credit for cleaner \n  production investment, \n  and a capacity-building \nplan for government \nagencies dealing with \nindustrial environmental \nmanagement. \n \nOutputs       \n1.
