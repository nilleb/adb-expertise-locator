INTRODUCTION \n1.  Trade facilitation is one of the four priority sectors of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program.1 CAREC work in this area is guided by the Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS), approved in 2007 by the 6th CAREC Ministerial Conference, \nand  the  Implementation  Action  Plan  for  TTFS  endorsed  at  the  7th  CAREC  Ministerial \nConference on 21 November 2008 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The action plan adopts an integrated \napproach,  focusing  on  the  development  of  six  CAREC  corridors  through  infrastructure \ninvestments and trade facilitation initiatives to improve the movement of goods through these \ncorridors and across borders. Recognizing the breadth of actions and substantial financing \nrequirements identified in the TTFS and the action plan, the 7th CAREC Ministerial Conference \ncalled  for  enhanced  joint  efforts  by  CAREC  countries  and  development  partners,  and \nhighlighted the need to expand interaction with other players, particularly the private sector. The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  as  the  lead  agency  for  trade  facilitation  programs  under \nCAREC, is requested to provide financial and technical assistance (TA).  \n \n2.  The regional policy and advisory TA is designed to support implementation of the action \nplan.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  the  CAREC  countries  on  various  occasions  to \ndetermine the impact, outcome, outputs, and implementation arrangements for the TA, and in \nparticular  during  the  CAREC  trade  facilitation  workshops  held  23\u221224  February  2009  in \nGuangzhou, the People's Republic of China and 26\u221228 May 2009 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. \nBroad agreement was reached on key aspects of the TA, and strong support was obtained for \nits design and implementation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   The CAREC trade facilitation program has two components: (i) customs-related work \nthat covers concerted customs reform, modernization, and cross-border cooperation; and (ii) \nintegrated trade facilitation (ITF) that promotes efficient regional trade logistics development, \npriority  trade  corridor  development,  single-window  schemes,  and  enhanced  interagency \ncoordination. There is a strong need to expand private sector participation in both areas.  \n \n4.   Work to promote customs cooperation is led by the Customs Cooperation Committee \n(CCC), and has been the core of the CAREC trade facilitation program, focusing on the five \npriority areas: (i) simplification and harmonization of customs procedures and documentation, \n(ii) modernization of customs information and communication technology and customs data \nexchange, (iii) risk management and post-entry audit, (iv) joint customs control, and (v) regional \ntransit development. The CCC has created an environment of trust and cooperation among the \nparticipating countries.  \n \n5.  Customs cooperation alone cannot address all trade facilitation issues, however. Trade \nfacilitation entails enhanced cooperation among many agencies, including those in charge of \ntransport, trade, customs services, and other cross-border activities. It also needs to involve \nvarious private sector players such as freight forwarders and logistics providers. Recognizing \n                                                 \n1 The CAREC was established in 1997 to promote development through cooperation among its eight participating \ncountries:  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People's  Republic  of  China,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. CAREC is also an alliance of six multilateral agencies active in promoting economic \ncooperation in Central Asia: ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \nMonetary Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. \nPriority sectors for cooperation are (i) transport, (ii) trade facilitation, (iii) trade policy, and (iv) energy.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 May 2009.  \n ", "2  \nthis need, the CCC introduced the ITF concept at its 6th meeting. It was strongly endorsed by \nCAREC countries and incorporated into the TTFS action plan.  \n \n6.   The TTFS seeks to use ITF to strengthen interagency coordination and public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP), develop an efficient regional logistics industry, and establish a regional \nmechanism to complement the CCC process.  In consultation with the CAREC countries, ADB \nis developing an ITF work program. The priority actions to be taken include: (i) establishing \nand/or improving a national joint committee on transport and trade facilitation (NJC) in each \nCAREC country, and forming a regional joint committee on transport and trade facilitation \n(RJC); (ii) continuing to conduct CAREC corridor performance measurement and monitoring \n(CPMM) and installing a CAREC-wide CPMM system; (iii) supporting the development of single-\nwindow schemes; (iv) promoting PPP for key investments in trade logistics; and (v) further \nenhancing capacity building for CAREC countries in trade facilitation. The ITF work program will \nalso seek to strengthen cooperation with other development partners in trade facilitation to \nmaximize synergies and avoid duplication. The CAREC Senior Officials Meeting (held 28\u221229 \nMay 2009) endorsed the ITF work program, and requested that ADB increase financial and \ntechnical support. The TA will focus on addressing these priority ITF issues, particularly by \nhelping CAREC countries overcome the key constraints highlighted below.  \n \n7.  The  NJCs  are  envisaged  to  promote  ITF  at  the  national  level  through  improved \ninteragency coordination and enhanced PPP. The RJC will serve as a regional forum to address \ntransport and trade facilitation issues, including corridor management. While the progress in \nestablishing NJCs varies among CAREC countries, they have several key issues in common \nthat need to be solved: (i) the NJC mandate and legal status are not fully confirmed, (ii) \ncommitment from the highest level of government is not always in place, (iii) the NJCs do not \nhave senior-level chairpersons, (iv) NJC membership lacks consistency and continuity, and (v) \nNJC's authority to make and implement decisions is often compromised. In addition, the RJC \nneeds to be established, and will require capacity building assistance.  \n \n8.  The  CPMM  has  been  piloted  since  early  2009  for  selected  CAREC  corridors.  A \nmemorandum  of  understanding  has  been  signed  with  each  CAREC  country  through  its \nrepresentative transport carrier and freight forwarder associations, which have begun submitting \ndata to ADB. However, the following key aspects of the CPMM need improvement: (i) the \nreporting format and frequency need to be formalized, (ii) data consolidation and analysis need \nto be enhanced to identify main constraints in the corridors and recommend remedial actions, \nand (iii) the capacity of partner associations needs further strengthening.  \n \n9.  CAREC has been promoting the adoption of the single-window scheme to streamline \ntransport,  freight  forwarding,  trade  logistics,  and  customs  operations  to  enhance  the \ncompetitiveness of the subregion. CAREC countries have yet to agree on a common single-\nwindow concept, however, and to prepare a regional road map for development of a regional \nsingle-window scheme that builds on experience from other regional cooperation and integration \nprograms.  \n \n10.  There are many factors constraining private sector participation in cross-border transport \nand trade in most of the CAREC participating countries, particularly: (i) lack of coordinated \nborder management, (ii) poor regional and interregional cooperation to address cross-border \ntrade issues, (iii) inadequate investment in infrastructure and trade logistics services, (iv) high \nbehind-the-border  costs,  and  (v)  absence  of  a  regional  body  to  represent  private  sector \ninterests. Comprehensive strategies and actions are needed to remove such constraints, and \nprivate  sector  users  need  to  be  involved  in  designing,  implementing  and  monitoring  such \n ", "  3\nstrategies and action plans. Consultations with the private sector need to be continued and \nexpanded to explore solutions to key trade facilitation issues, such as improving access to \nfinancing, developing PPP projects, and identifying innovative financing schemes. \n \n11.  The ITF program will be implemented in close collaboration with the CCC work, which \nwill continue to form the core of CAREC\u2019s trade facilitation efforts. There is extensive potential \nfor synergy between the two aspects of CAREC trade facilitation that needs to be fully tapped.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of this TA is to improve the efficiency of trade flows in the CAREC region, as \nmeasured by a 50% reduction in border-crossing time along the CAREC corridors in 2012, as \ncompared with 2007.  \n \n13.  The TA outcome will be strengthened national and regional collaboration, including \nenhanced partnerships between the public and private sectors, in developing and managing the \nkey CAREC corridors and addressing broader issues of transport and trade facilitation. National \nand regional capacity relating to the design, implementation, and monitoring of comprehensive \nstrategies to remove constraints to trade flows within the region and with the global market will \nbe strengthened. Specifically, national and regional cooperation mechanisms will be established \nand supported to (i) implement national and regional transport and trade facilitation plans, (ii) \nmeasure and monitor progress of the priority corridors and develop strategies to address trade \nbottlenecks, and (iii) actively engage the private sector and key development partners in the \ndesign and implementation of the TTFS and its action plan.  \n \n14.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs:  \n \n(i)  establishment  and  effective  functioning  of  the  NJCs  and  the  RJC  and \ndevelopment of national transport and trade facilitation action plans;  \n(ii)  setting  up  of  an  integrated  CPMM  scheme,  with  policy  recommendations  to \nCAREC countries to improve corridor performance and corridor management;  \n(iii)  adoption of a common concept and a road map for developing a single-window \nscheme in the CAREC countries;  \n(iv)  development of PPP opportunities to promote ITF, particularly in the areas of \nimproving trade logistics services and border crossing facilities; and \n(v)  establishment  and  improvement  of  the  CAREC  Federation  of  Carrier  and \nForwarder Associations (CFCFA).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The following activities will be undertaken under the TA: \n \n(i)  Studies will be conducted and training workshops and conferences organized to \nhelp each CAREC country establish an NJC, and the CAREC region establish an \nRJC.  The  NJC  will  be  composed  of  representatives  from  all  government \nagencies involved in border control and border-crossing activities, including (a) \nthe transport and trade ministries; (b) customs; and (c) agencies responsible for \nenforcing quarantine, sanitary, phytosanitary and product standards, ensuring \n ", "4  \nsecurity,  and  implementing  immigration  rules  and  regulations.  Private  sector \nrepresentatives  from  freight  forwarders  associations,  trade  logistics  service \nproviders and transport groups will also be involved. NJCs will develop and \nimplement  national  transport  and  trade  facilitation  action  plans.  The  RJC, \nmeanwhile, will be composed of representatives from the NJCs, and will provide \nregional leadership in updating and implementing the TTFS action plan, including \nthe work related to the long-term management of the corridors. It will work closely \nwith  the  CAREC  Transport  Sector  Coordinating  Committee  and  the  CCC  in \nupdating and refining the action plan. \n(ii)  Studies will be conducted and workshops organized to set up and improve the \nintegrated CPMM scheme, including the establishment of a database, by building \non  results  of  the  pilot  CPMM  project.  The  database  will  provide  various \nstakeholders  with  greater  access  to  critical  information  regarding  the \nperformance of the priority CAREC corridors and actions that have been or are \nbeing  taken  to  resolve  identified  bottlenecks  and  constraints.  Private  sector \norganizations (freight forwarders and road carrier associations, transport groups \nand trade logistics service providers) involved in the pilot phase in carrying out \nthe time-cost-distance analysis will be provided with further support to participate \nin the development of a more integrated performance measurement scheme \nrelevant to CAREC\u2019s needs and priorities, including adapting the time-release \nmethod of the World Customs Organization and the logistics performance index \nof the World Bank to the requirements of the CAREC priority corridors.  \n(iii)  Studies will be conducted and workshops organized to promote the adoption and \nthe implementation of the single-window scheme in CAREC countries.  \n(iv)  Public\u2013private dialogues will be organized to promote PPP and create a more \nconducive environment for private sector investment in trade facilitation.  More \nproactive  engagement  with  the  private  sector  will  provide  opportunities  for \ngovernment policy makers, investors, entrepreneurs, and financial intermediaries \nto  explore  the  investment  potential  and  develop  innovative  financing \narrangements  in  transport  and  trade  facilitation,  particularly  with  a  view  to \ndefining necessary interventions to improve infrastructure and procedures at key \nborder crossing points along the CAREC corridors. Support will be provided for \nthe establishment and operations of the CFCFA, which is expected to represent \nthe concerns and interests of the private sector in CAREC trade facilitation.  \n(v)  Training activities will be conducted in collaboration with the CAREC Institute on \npriority subjects in trade facilitation jointly identified by the CAREC countries.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $2,500,000 equivalent, of which $1,500,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB through the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility, \nand $500,000 on a grant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund and administered by ADB. The CAREC governments and the private \nsector participating in the TA will jointly contribute a total of about $500,000 equivalent by \nproviding counterpart staff, office space, support for training, seminars and conferences, and \nother administrative and logistical services. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  A total of 25 person-months of international and 25 person-months of national consultant \ninputs will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the TA. The consultants \nand resource persons will be specialists in the areas of integrated trade facilitation, regional \ntrade logistics, customs reform and modernization, and institutional and capacity building, with \nspecial knowledge of PPP development. Because the TA will involve varied activities that will \nconsist  mostly  of  straightforward  assignments,  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be \nselected and engaged by ADB as individuals based on their qualifications and experience in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. \nOffice equipment will be procured by the implementing agencies in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and will be transferred to \nimplementing agencies upon completion of the TA. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \nline with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.3  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from January 2010 to December 2012. ADB \nwill  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies  in  the  CAREC  countries  will  be \ngovernment agencies that take the lead in NJCs, in close collaboration with the private sector. \nThe Financial Sector, Public Management and Regional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia \nDepartment will administer and implement the TA in close collaboration with the Transport and \nCommunications  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  and  the  concerned \nresident missions in the CAREC countries. Special efforts will be made to maximize the synergy \nbetween the work of the CCC and RJC and that of the transport sector coordinating committee. \nEfforts will also be made to strengthen the partnership with the World Customs Organization to \nensure a coordinated approach to customs cooperation and other trade facilitation initiatives. The \nmonitoring of implementation progress and outcomes will be carried out through periodic reviews, \nas outlined in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n19.  The TA outputs, particularly the findings and recommendations from the key studies, will \nbe disseminated through workshops, seminars, conferences, publication, and the media. Where \nappropriate, representatives of the secretariats of other regional cooperation bodies will be \ninvited to dissemination events.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund, and (ii) providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a \ngrant basis for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Working with the Private Sector in \nTrade Facilitation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.
