INTRODUCTION \n1.  India has an extensive network of rivers, lakes and canals, which if developed for \nshipping and navigation, can provide an efficient network of inland transportation. An optimal \nmix of road, rail and inland waterway transport will provide an efficient transport infrastructure \nthat is flexible and cost-effective. The Government of India (the Government) wants to revive \nand promote the use of inland waterway transport and requested ADB technical assistance \n(TA).  The  Fact-finding  Mission  visited  India  from  22-30  April  2001  and  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA is included in the \n2002 TA program for India.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Preliminary estimates prepared by the Government indicate that the capital cost of \ninland waterways in India is between 5-10 percent of the cost of constructing an equivalent 4-\nlane road or rail link. Maintenance cost can also be relatively lower for inland waterway at about \n20 percent of road maintenance cost. It is also more fuel-efficient since it is estimated that one \nliter of fuel can move 24 ton-km of freight by road, 85 ton-km by rail and 105 ton-km by inland \nwater transport. It is estimated that every shift of one billion ton-km to inland waterways will \nreduce the fuel cost by $5 million and the overall transport cost by $9 million. Should these \npreliminary estimates be confirmed, it means that inland waterways have the potential to be a \nvery  cost-effective  transport  mode.  A  viable  inland  water  transport  system  can  therefore \ncontribute effectively to lowering (i) transportation cost and thus cost of goods, (ii) amount of fuel \nused in the transport sector and (iii) its attendant problems of pollution. These benefits in turn \ncan help increase economic growth in India. It will also mean that developing inland water \ntransport can allow India to avoid the development of more expensive transport modes such as \nroads and rail in corridors that can be served by inland waterways thus contributing to saving \nand optimizing the use of funds in the transport sector. The savings in funds can be utilized for \npoverty reduction efforts while the increase in economic growth can also indirectly help in \npoverty reduction efforts. In addition by opening up new areas that are poorly served by other \ntransport modes e.g., in the Northeast region, inland waterways can make a direct contribution \nto poverty reduction efforts.  \n \n3.  The annual cargo moved by inland waterway transport in 2000 was about 1.5 billion ton-\nkm out of the total cargo market of 1,000 billion ton-km i.e. a modal share of only 0.15 percent. \nThis tiny modal share is because of several reasons. The infrastructure facilities for inland water \ntransport are poor. Most of the waterways suffer from navigational hazards like shallow waters, \nnarrow  width  of  channels  during  dry  season,  siltation,  bank  erosion,  and  inadequate \nnavigational  aids  to  permit  24-hour  a  day  operations.  There  is  also  a  lack  of  supporting \ninfrastructure  like  adequate  and  properly  equipped  terminals  and  warehouses.  Another \nconstraint in using inland waterways as a viable transport mode is the lack of adequate vessels. \nThe existing availability of vessels for inland waterway transport in the public and private sectors \nput together is less than 400 vessels including tankers, bulk carriers, barges, and other vessels, \nwith an average capacity of 600 tons. \n \n4.  The  physical  problems  affecting  the  development  of  the  inland  waterway  transport \nsubsector are a reflection of the weaknesses in the institutional and regulatory environment for \nthe subsector. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) established in 1986, is the nodal \n                                                 \n1 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2002 ", "2 \nagency for the development of infrastructure in the National Waterways. The IWAI Act, 1985 \ngives very broad powers to the IWAI to act as a provider, facilitator, regulator and even as a \njoint venture partner for the development of the IWAI. It can enter into and perform any contract \nnecessary for the discharge of its functions, provide or permit the setting up of infrastructure \nfacilities and with the approval of the Government levy any fees for services provided in relation \nto the use of the national waterways. However to date IWAI does not impose any such fees. It \ndoes not have any internal capacity to carry out economic regulation. While the IWAI has the \ntechnical capability to identify and implement infrastructure works to improve the navigation \nalong waterways, it does not have the skills necessary to develop the subsector in an integrated \nmanner. This is seen in the studies it carries out. While it carried out feasibility studies to identify \nthe required infrastructure improvements, it does not have in place a comprehensive masterplan \nintegrating these required infrastructure improvements with the need for supporting facilities \n(e.g.,  terminals  and  warehouses  with  intermodal  transfer  facilities),  improved  operating \nefficiency by fleet operators and a strategic marketing plan to attract users to this subsector that \nis required to ensure the success of inland waterway transport.  \n \n5.  The Central Inland Water Transport Corporation (CIWTC), a public sector undertaking \nset up in 1967 is the principal inland water operator. In addition to running services from Kolkata \nto Bangladesh and to Assam as well as lighterage services in the River Hooghly and services \nfrom Kolkata to Allahabad, it also carries out the construction and repair of small and medium \nsized  vessels  as  well  as  repairs  of  ocean-going  vessels.  Its  operational  and  financial \nperformance and its fleet capacity utilization are very poor. Its current customers have stated \nthat it does not have a strong commercial focus or strong marketing skills to attract more \nbusiness. The CIWTC has been incurring operating losses since its inception in 1967 and relies \non Government budgetary support. At present private sector companies play only a very \nminimal role in operating inland waterway services. Nevertheless private sector companies are \nprofitable and have higher productivity than the CIWTC. Private sector operators face several \nhandicaps such as requiring a license from the CIWTC to undertake cross-border (India-\nBangladesh) services from the CIWTC, i.e. their competitor. \n \n6.  Three waterways have been declared as National Waterways.2 National Waterway 1 is \nthe River Ganga from Haldia to Allahabad with a total length of 1620 km. National Waterway 2 \nis the River Brahmaputra from Dhubri to Sadiya (891 km) and National Waterway 3 is the West \nCoast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with the Champakkara and Udyogamandal \nCanals (205 km). In addition under the current Tenth Development Plan that came into force in \nApril 2002, the Government is planning to extend the national waterway system by declaring \nanother five waterways i.e. (i) Barak River; (ii) Kakinada-Mercaunam Canal integrated with \nGodavari and Krishna Rivers; (iii) East Coast Canal integrated with Brahmani river system; (iv) \nextension of National Waterway 3; and (v) Damodar Valley Canal as national waterways (see \nattached  map  for  current  and  potential  national  waterways).  This  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s objective to revive inland waterways as a viable transport mode. The IWAI also \nprepared detailed project reports infrastructure improvements of several National Waterways. \nHowever  these  studies  are  a  bit  dated  and  need  to  be  reviewed  and  updated,  and \nsupplementary studies carried out where necessary, to assess whether the current and potential \nNational  Waterways  are  a  viable  transport  mode.  This  includes  assessing  whether  the \ninfrastructure improvements needed are economically viable and the operation of inland water \ntransport services is financially viable.  \n                                                 \n2 The Inland Waterways Authority of India Act of 1985 empowers the government to declare waterways to declare \nwaterways with potential for development of shipping and navigation as National Waterways and to develop such \nwaterways for efficient shipping and navigation.  ", "    3 \n \n7.  Furthermore before the potential benefits can be realized, it will be necessary to actually \nattract cargo to inland waterways. It is therefore necessary to formulate a sector development \nstrategy. This would include formulating a strategic marketing campaign designed to identify \npotential markets, decision criteria used in those markets for mode choice and how to target \nthose markets, establishing the optimum infrastructure and service parameters, identification of \ncriteria for infrastructure project selection, institutional strengthening of the IWAI so that it can \nplay its roles in facilitating, infrastructure provision and maintenance, as well as acting as a \ncredible technical and economic regulator, restructuring the CIWTC so that it competes on a \nlevel playing field with potential private operators and formulating a private sector development \nplan incorporating public-private partnerships so that the maximum possible private sector \ninvestment is secured for infrastructure provision and maintenance and in operating inland \nwater  transport  services.  It  is  also  necessary  to  investigate  the  potential  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  of  inland  waterway  development  including  identifying  any  land \nacquisition required, resettlement action plans if necessary and assessing effect of dredging \nand infrastructure works on water flows and water volumes and the associated aquatic habitats. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will be carried out in two phases. The objective of the first phase is to assess the \ntechnical, economic and financial feasibility of inland water transport in the corridors served by \nthe three current and five potential national waterways mentioned in para. 6 above to establish \n(i) the potential demand at different infrastructure and service parameters e.g., different least \navailable depth (LAD) and service frequencies, (ii) the infrastructure requirements in terms of \nengineering requirements, dredging requirements, navigational requirements and aids, terminal \nfacilities including warehousing/storage needs, intermodal linkages as well as equipment needs \nand (iii) the fleet size and operational performance requirements to meet the potential demand. \nBased on these parameters, the consultants will have to assess the economic viability of \nimproving  the  inland  waterway  infrastructure  and  the  financial  viability  of  operating  inland \nwaterway  transport  services  and  recommend  the  optimum  infrastructure  and  service \nparameters. There will also be a comparative analysis with road and rail to identify the least cost \noption.  \n \n9.  If inland water transport is found to be viable under Phase I, Phase II of the study will \ncommence. The objective of this second phase will be to prepare a sector development strategy \nand to prepare inland waterway transport investment projects for ADB loan financing. This \nphase will include formulation of a strategic marketing plan to increase modal share of inland \nwaterway  transport,  formulation  project  masterplan  and  selection  criteria,  preliminary \nengineering design for infrastructure improvements, initial environmental examination, initial \nsocial assessment and preparation of resettlement framework, formulation of a road map for \nlegal/ regulatory reform of the sector and institutional strengthening of IWAI, identification of \nfinancing and operating mechanisms to ensure adequate maintenance; measures to improve \nthe  operational  and  financial  performance  of  CIWTC,  formulation  of  a  private  sector \ndevelopment plan to maximize private sector investment in both infrastructure development and \nvessel  operations  and  a  review  on  strengthening  inland  waterway  transport  operations \nparticularly  between  India  and  Bangladesh  including  improvements  in  Customs  and \ndocumentation procedures.  \n ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Surveys need to be carried out to estimate potential demand for inland water transport \nservices economic and financial viability of this subsector, the potential for subregional demand. \nThese surveys and analysis will form the basis for a strategic marketing plan. Engineering and \nhydrological surveys will need to be carried out to for preliminary engineering studies for \ninfrastructure,  terminal,  navigational,  and  fleet  requirements  as  well  as  to  formulate \nrecommendations to improve the intermodal connections between inland waterways and other \ntransport modes principally roads but also railways. Social and environmental surveys will be \nneeded for the initial social impact and initial environmental examinations so that potential \nnegative social and environmental impacts can be alleviated. An institutional analysis of the \nIWAI needs to be carried out to identify its strengths and weaknesses and to recommend how it \ncan best play its role as a sector regulator. An operational and financial review of the CIWTC \nneeds to be carried out to identify its strengths and weaknesses, recommend how it can be \nrestructured to function as a viable operator, the investment required and the associated \nfinancing options as well as a plan identifying how it can be fully divested from the government.  \n \n11.  The activities that need to be carried out are data-intensive and it is assumed that the \nrequired data will be readily available in a timely fashion. It is also assumed that the private \nsector will cooperate in the surveys especially in identifying the decision criteria that are critical \nto determining transport mode choice. It is assumed that the CIWTC will allow access to its \nfinancial and operational data because this is critical to developing a restructuring plan for the \nCIWTC. Another factor that needs to be borne in mind is that the engineering, hydrological and \nenvironmental surveys may be hampered by adverse weather conditions and the timing of TA \ncommencement will be chosen to minimize delays due to weather conditions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the TA is estimated as $1,125,000 equivalent comprising $675,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $450,000 equivalent in local currency costs. It is proposed that ADB will \nprovide $900,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $675,000 and \n$225,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  provide \n$225,000 equivalent for local currency costs in the form of services and facilities including \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation and transport and administrative resources. The budget \nincludes provision for the travel costs of two Government representatives to Manila for contract \nnegotiations. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 1. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit the ADB to financing \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Ministry of Shipping (MOS) will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will chair a \nsteering committee consisting of MOS, DEA, IWAI and CIWTC. The steering committee will \nmeet monthly and the inception, draft final and final reports of the consultant will need to be \napproved by this committee. The MOS will designate a senior officer as Chairperson of the \nsteering  committee  who  will  provide  policy  guidance  to  the  study.  The  IWAI  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency and will chair a technical sub-committee that will closely monitor the TA \nand report to the steering committee. The technical sub-committee will consist of IWAI and \nCIWTC officials. The technical sub-committee will discuss the working details of the study and \nprovide overall coordination and support to the study. The IWAI will designate a senior officer as ", "    5 \nthe Chairperson of the technical sub-committee and who will act as the focal point for the study \nteam. This sub-committee will meet at least once a month to consider the progress of the study.  \n \n14.  An international consultant firm that can supply a team with expertise in (i) technical, \neconomic  and  financial  feasibility  studies  of  transport  projects;  (ii)  demand  analysis  and \nmarketing  strategies  for  freight  transport;  (iii)  environment  impact  assessment  of  inland \nwaterways; (iv) social impact assessment and preparation of resettlement action plans; (v) \ninland waterway sector operations; (vi) restructuring of state-owned enterprises; (vii) formulation \nof private sector development and public-private partnership plans as well as financial appraisal \nof new ventures; and (viii) legal and policy issues relevant to inland waterway operations \nsupported by domestic consultants with expertise in (i) civil, hydraulic and dredging engineering \nof inland waterway infrastructure improvements, (ii) environment impact assessment of riverine \nand canal improvement projects (iii) social impact analysis and preparation of resettlement \naction plans; (iv) legal framework on private sector investment and (v) survey design and \nanalysis skills will be engaged under the TA. Domestic consultants will be engaged by the \ninternational consultant firm, which will have overall responsibility for the TA. Consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB to provide an estimated 30 person-months of international \nand 20 person-months of domestic consulting services. Outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are attached as Appendix 2. Any equipment procurement will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement.  \n \n15.  The TA is expected to be carried out over 7 months, starting in February 2003 and \nending in August 2003. Three Tripartite Review Meetings will be held, one to consider the \nPhase I report, the second to consider the Phase II Inception Report and the third the Draft Final \nReport. The timings for these report submissions are given in Appendix 2. In addition there will \nbe an ADB review mission at the end of the fourth month of the TA commencement. The \nconsultant will also be required to organize two workshops, one after the completion of Phase I \nand the other after the Draft Final Report, to which interested parties from the private sector \nincluding current and potential users, investors and financiers will be invited. The purpose is to \ngive all concerned an assessment of the potential of inland water transport as a viable transport \nmode and an opportunity to the private sector to give views and suggestions about the direction \nand findings of the Study. The second workshop has an additional objective, which is to inform \npotential users investors of the opportunities that exist in the sector. The TA budget provides for \nthese workshops and for the dissemination of information.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.
