I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed Asian Development Fund grant, and (iii) proposed administration of a grant \nto be provided by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), all to Nepal for the Kathmandu \nSustainable Urban Transport Project. \n \n2.  The project1 will improve the quality of urban life in the capital city of Nepal by delivering \na more efficient, safe, and sustainable urban transport system (UTS),2 favoring local economic \ngrowth and addressing climate change and air pollution mitigation. The UTS will be enhanced \nby focusing on (i) a plan to rationalize and upgrade the existing public transport network, tested \nthrough the implementation of pilot routes provided with electric vehicles; (ii) traffic management \nworks and measures that will enable heritage routes in the city center to be pedestrianized and \nimprove general walkability (general walking conditions); and (iii) improvement of air quality \nmonitoring. The project aims to integrate these components holistically. The environment for \ndevelopment work has greatly improved since 2006, when the decade-long conflict ended. The \nexperience  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  shown  that  active  community \nparticipation can insulate development work from a country's wider challenges and thus bring \nabout  effective  service  delivery.  Consultations  were  undertaken  with  various  stakeholders, \nincluding the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), relevant central government ministries and \ndepartments, public transport operators, and residents associations. The project design and \nimplementation  arrangements  have  fully  taken  into  account  the  current  political  context  in \nNepal,3 with the implementation expected to proceed amid the ongoing peace process.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Congestion, urban mobility, and economic growth. Kathmandu valley is severely \nconstrained in developing efficient urban infrastructure, notably its UTS. Population growth,4 \nurban sprawl, and increasing motorization rates5 are compounding congestion, pedestrian and  \nvehicular  conflict,  environmental  degradation,  road  accidents,  and  poor  public  transport \noperation and services. These issues restrict the ability of the valley to function efficiently, which \nhas serious ramifications on continued economic growth and development. Traffic congestion in \nKathmandu has become serious\u2014cross-city journeys are measured in hours, not minutes; \nroads are saturated, and one incident at a junction has implications throughout the entire road \nnetwork. Traffic is frequently at a standstill, with significant costs in terms of lost time, missed \nappointments, needless wastage of fuel, pollution, and journeys that did not take place.6  \n \n4.  Road network and safety. Road density in Kathmandu is average, at 54 kilometers \n(km) per 100 km2. However, main roads are often narrow, clogged with parked cars and buses \nwaiting for passengers. Bad driving contributes to the chaos. It is estimated to cost about \n$190 million to acquire land to widen 15 km of narrow sections of the main road network by \n                                                 \n1  The project was prepared through a regional project preparatory technical assistance (TA): ADB. 2009. Preparing \nthe Implementation of Asian City Transport\u2013Promoting Sustainable Urban Transport in Asia Project. Manila. The \ntotal TA amount was $2.8 million, financed under the Climate Change Fund, with $0.82 million allocated for \nKathmandu. The consultants commenced their work in October 2009 and submitted a draft final report on 12 \nMarch 2010. \n2  The UTS refers to the specific characteristics of people transportation (transport modes, traffic management, level \nof organization, etc.); and the resulting issues (congestion and pollution). \n3  On 28 May 2010, the Constituent Assembly extended its term for one year to draft the new constitution. \n4  At current rates, the valley population may double in 10 years, from 2 million to 4 million. \n5  Registered vehicles in Kathmandu increased by 84% from 2001 to 2006. There are now about 450,000 vehicles, \n74% of which are motorcycles. With easy credit terms, vehicle ownership continues to increase (13% in 2009), \nespecially for cars, as motorcyclists switch to cheap cars. \n6  Road congestion costs Asian economies an estimated 2%\u20135% of gross domestic product every year. \n ", "2 \n10 meters  (m),  and  the  benefit  of  such  massive  expenditure  is  questionable.  If  vehicle \nownership continues to increase at current rates, the capacity of widened roads would soon be \nexceeded. Selective improvements may be justified to remove bottlenecks or provide alternative \nroutes, but continuously expanding the urban road network is neither a sustainable solution nor \nan equitable one, since road space is increasingly saturated by private vehicles, benefiting only \na small portion of the population (17% of Kathmandu valley households) and not the urban poor. \nPedestrians use narrow, badly paved sidewalks; have difficulty crossing roads; are obliged to \ngive way to vehicles, even in the historic city center; and have their safety impaired. The valley \nregistered 2,765 road accidents during 2008\u20132009, often involving pedestrians or cyclists. In \nKathmandu alone, 95 people died and 156 were injured from October 2009 to March 2010.7  \n \n5.  Public  transport.  With  the  termination  of  government-operated  services, 8  public \ntransport is now exclusively provided by the private sector through individual operators using \nvarious vehicles that are often poorly assigned to routes. Buses are overcrowded and are a \npoor substitute to private vehicles. Services need to be improved and made affordable for the \npoor, as well as accessible to the elderly, the disabled, women, and children.  \n \n6.  Air  pollution  and  climate  change.  Increasing  dependence  on  private  modes  of \ntransport and related consumption of imported fossil fuels will (i) have adverse impacts on local \nair quality, (ii) place a strain on the country\u2019s energy supply, and (iii) result in rapid increases in \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The transport sector is the biggest producer of carbon \ndioxide (CO ) emissions in Nepal, and 386,000 metric tons of CO  were released in Kathmandu \n2 2\nvalley in 2009. With an increase in vehicles, this is expected to rise dramatically (two to three \ntimes)  in  the  next  10  years,  together  with  particulate  matter  (PM ) and  total  suspended \n10  \nparticulates  (TSP),  which  have  become  a  serious  public  health  concern.  Readings  from \nroadside monitoring stations9 indicate particle levels of PM at 200 milligrams per cubic meter \n10 \n(mg/m3), 67% in excess of the 120 mg/m3 national standard, and far exceeding World Health \nOrganization standards (50 mg/m3). The main cause is vehicle emissions\u2014less than 1% of all \nregistered vehicles in Kathmandu valley produce low emissions. Therefore, making the UTS \nmore  efficient  will  create  numerous  benefits  such  as  reduced  local  air  pollution  and  CO  \n2\nemission. \n \n7.  Link  with  country  partnership  strategy  and  national  priorities.  The  project  is \nincluded and in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS) \nfor  Nepal,10 which  is  centered  on  four  pillars\u2014inclusive  economic  growth,  inclusive  social \ndevelopment,  governance  and  capacity  building,  and  environmental  sustainability.  It  is \nconsistent with the government\u2019s National Urban Policy, notably with one of its priorities\u2014the \nimprovement of quality of life of urban inhabitants through the creation of a clean, safe, and \ndeveloped urban environment. It strongly supports the inclusion of sustainable urban transport \n(SUT) as a priority in the government\u2019s next Three-Year Interim Plan, FY2010\u2013FY2012. The \nproject design reflects lessons from previous projects:11 (i) involving stakeholders in project \ndesign from an early stage; and (ii) providing capacity development support, especially financial \nmanagement and technical capacity, from an early stage of project implementation. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Metropolitan Traffic Police Division (MTPD) statistics. \n8 The trolleybus ceased operations in 2008 and the state bus company Sahja Yatayat was declared bankrupt in 2007. \nSummary Sector Assessment: Urban Transport Sector (Appendix 2, para. 5, footnote 2). \n9  Air quality was monitored in seven stations over 5 years (2003\u20132007). The stations are now out of operation but will \nbe repaired in the coming months within the new action plan of the Ministry of Environment. The project proposes \nto support this plan, notably by providing the repaired stations with solar-powered backup systems. \n10 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012.

The  project  is  part  of  a  coordinated  effort  among \ndevelopment partners, including the ADB, the World Bank, the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, and the public\u2013private partnership (PPP) team of the United Nations Development \nProgram.12  \n \n9.  Project approach. Kathmandu is the first of seven pilot cities studied under two ADB \nregional TA projects13 to produce an operational project on SUT. This shows the government\u2019s \nstrong determination to tackle this issue. The key urban mobility requirements in Kathmandu \nvalley lie in the need for a strategic vision of the UTS. Throughout the project preparatory TA, \nADB supported the formulation of an SUT vision for Kathmandu valley. The project is an \nimportant step toward endorsement of this vision by the government and the KMC. The vision \naims at (i) encouraging people to travel by public transport or on foot; (ii) discouraging the use of \nprivate motorized vehicles, particularly from entering the city center; (iii) improving movement of \nall modes; (iv) enhancing air quality; and (v) improving transport equity. \n \n10.  The project is in line with the Sustainable Transport Initiative.14 This is a pilot project, \ndemonstrating and undertaking a set of necessary actions leading toward the vision, and setting \nup the basis of a future sector policy. The project seeks a long-term partnership with the \ngovernment  in  the  urban  transport  sector,  and  includes  an  important  capacity  building \ncomponent, as well as further studies focused on public transport, which could set the stage for \na future project, and possibly for a multitranche financing facility in the sector. \n \n11.  The project follows a pragmatic approach, starting reform of the whole UTS through \nconcrete pilot actions integrating all UTS components. The proposed creation of a new public \ntransport division in the Department of Transport Management (DOTM) is an opportunity to \nrethink the overall institutional organization of the UTS in Kathmandu valley, and is paving the \nway for progressive setup of a unique urban transport authority. The proposed mechanism to \nfinance the pilot bus routes through a fund managed by the Town Development Fund (TDF) \ncould be the forerunner of a future sustainable urban transport fund to ensure long-term viability \nand secure adequate finances to support continued improvements to the UTS in Kathmandu \nvalley. The grant and loan proceeds put in the fund would then be seed money, possibly \ncomplemented later by proceeds such as fuel tax, parking fines, or carbon credits. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The expected impact of the project will be a more efficient and sustainable UTS in \nKathmandu valley, favoring local economic growth and addressing climate change and air \npollution mitigation. The expected outcome of the project will be improved public transport and \nwalkability, favoring a modal shift from private vehicles and improving traffic conditions. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The project proposes to adress urban transport requirements and achieve the SUT \nvision through four outputs (linked with the vision statements in para. 9) and related activities. \n \n14.  Component  1  activities  will  (i)  improve  and  upgrade  public  transport  management, \nfacilities, and operations; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of and empower the currently weak \n                                                 \n12 Development coordination (Appendix 2) provides more details. \n13  ADB. 2007.

It focuses on developing \u201cUTS that are \naccessible, safe, environmentally-friendly, and affordable.\u201d   \n ", "4 \nDOTM.15 The  project  proposes  to  provide  the  public  sector  with  the  incentives  needed  to \nreinvest in public transport and be in a position to negotiate the system\u2019s upgrade with the \nprivate sector. Activities will include (i) a capacity development program and a restructuration \nplan for the DOTM; (ii) a method and a reorganization plan for the public transport network; (iii) \nthe start of the public transport reform process through the implementation of two pilot bus \nroutes; (iv) the promotion of public transport fleet renewal on the pilot routes with electric or low-\nemission vehicles by setting up a financing mechanism with the TDF; and (v) an assessment \nreport and preliminary design of the reintroduction of modernized trolleybus services as a mass \ntransit system on major arterials of the city, with operations undertaken by the private sector.  \n \n15.  Component 2 activities will improve traffic management.16 This is the UTS component \nmost likely to have a short-term positive influence on traffic congestion. The project proposes to \nlink traffic management and transport demand management by facilitating traffic flow around the \ncity center and restricting it in the city center (pedestrianization under the project, road pricing at \na later stage). Activities will include (i) improvement of 10 junctions in the city center, and four \nalong Bishnumati Link Road (BLR) to complete it (including the construction of two bridges), and \nallowing it be a transit corridor, reducing congestion in the city center; (ii) provision of equipment \nto the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division (MTPD);17 (iii) a capacity development program to \nensure  good  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  equipment  by  the  MTPD,  and \nenforcement  of  traffic  regulations;  and  (iv)  an  awareness  campaign  for  improved  driving \nbehavior, environmental and safety aspects of transport, and promotion of public transport.   \n \n16.  Component  3  activities  will  improve  walkability  in  the  city  center.  Kathmandu  was \nrecently labeled one of the least walkable cities in Asia by the Clean Air Initiative in Asia.18 \nActivities will include (i) pedestrianization of heritage routes in the city center; (ii) improvement of \nsidewalks in the city center; (iii) upgrade of two existing pedestrian bridges, and construction of \ntwo new ones across Bishnumati River; (iv) improvement of the interchange facility and public \nspace on Kanti Path; and (v) PPP advisory support to the KMC for redevelopment of the old bus \npark and construction of parking lots in the city center.  \n   \n17.  Component  4  activities  will  enhance  the  monitoring  of  air  quality,  by  assisting  the \nMinistry of Environment (MOE) to implement its air quality monitoring action plan, 2010\u20132013. \nSupport will be provided through (i) the provision of solar power backup systems for the existing \nseven stations, following their repair and restart by the MOE; (ii) the provision of two new mobile \nmonitoring stations; (iii) equipment for emissions and mechanical testing (two sets each for the \nDOTM and the MTPD); and (iv) an awareness campaign about risks associated with vehicle \nemissions, together with air quality data dissemination in the media and on display boards. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $30.42 million, including taxes and duties of about \n$3.8 million  to  be  financed  by  the  government.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  and  interest  charge  during  implementation.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR6.886 \nmillion, and a grant not exceeding $10 million, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, to help \nfinance the project (Table 2). The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s total financing of $20 million, or 66% of the total project cost, will be used to \nfinance  (i)  part  of  the  civil  works;  (ii)  equipment;  (iii)  consulting  services;  (iv)  part  of  the \nimplementation of the pilot bus routes; (v) part of the recurrent costs; (vi) training and capacity \nbuilding;  (vii) awareness  campaigns;  and  (viii)  interest  charges  during  implementation. \nGovernment and KMC financing of $7.9 million, or 26% of the total project cost, will be used for \nland acquisition and resettlement, taxes and duties, part of project management, and part of the \ncivil works. \n \n \n21.  The GEF grant cofinancing of $2.52 million, or about 8% of the total project cost, will be \nused to finance part of the public transport component, related to climate change and air \npollution mitigation measures e.g. loan to purchase electric, or other low emission vehicles in \nreplacement  of  diesel  microbuses  on  the  pilot  bus  routes,  and  a  feasibility  study  for  the \nreintroduction of trolleybuses. ADB typically seeks approval from its Board of Directors for the \nadministration of grant funds from co-financers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. \nIn the case of the proposed GEF grant funding, the submission of the GEF Endorsement \nDocument is planned in July 2010. To facilitate project implementation, the Board is requested \nto approve administration of the proposed grant, in an amount not exceeding $2.8 million \n(including the 10% ADB administration fee), which is expected to be confirmed subsequent to \nBoard approval. Approval of the GEF grant will be reported to the Board by standard reporting \nprocedures. If GEF does not approve grant financing, the portion to be financed by GEF grant \nwill not be financed under the project. Alternatively, the government may make arrangements, \nsatisfactory to ADB, to cover the funding shortfall.

The government recently established permanent committees to provide policy direction \nand  interagency  coordination  for  transport  in  Kathmandu  valley:  the  high-level  policy \ncoordination committee (HLPCC) and the implementation committee. The HLPCC will develop \nand provide policy guidance and high-level interministerial coordination; and recommend key \npolicy decisions on valley transport issues, including the project. It will meet every 2 months.   \n \n23.  The  implementation  committee  will  review,  guide,  and  monitor  overall  project \nimplementation; assist in interagency coordination; and resolve project implementation issues. It \nwill meet at least once every month to discuss project progress. The committee ensures that \nHLPCC policy directions are implemented, and reports to the HLPCC. The implementation \ncommittee is chaired by the director general of the DOTM. \n  \n24.  For the purpose of the project, the implementation committee will function as the project \nsteering committee (PSC). In carrying out this function, it will be chaired by the secretary of the \nMPPW, and the joint secretary of the MPPW will be the secretary of the PSC. \n \n25.  The MPPW will be the executing agency, responsible for overall project execution and \ncoordination. A project management and coordination office (PMCO) will be established in the \nMPPW. The PMCO will be headed by a full-time project director selected from first class officers \nof the government, and will be responsible for managing all PMCO activities. The project \ndirector will be assisted by a deputy project director, an engineer, an accounts officer, and a \nsocial development officer. The PMCO will be responsible for (i) preparing the overall project \nimplementation  plan  and  detailed  work  program;  (ii) reviewing  and  approving  designs  of \nsubprojects and equipment specifications submitted by implementing agencies; (iii) providing \noverall  guidance  and  assistance  to  implementing  agencies  on  procurement  and  engaging \nconsultants;  (iv)  carrying  out  procurement  of  large  equipment  on  behalf  of  and  under  the \ntechnical supervision of implementing agencies, notably the MTPD and MOE; (v) recruiting the \nproject management and capacity building consultants; (vi) preparing and consolidating project \nprogress and completion reports; and (vii) ensuring compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and financing agreement covenants.  \n \n26.  The PMCO will also function as the secretariat of the implementation committee to assist \nin (i) carrying out administration of the secretariat, such as preparing meeting agendas and \nminutes; and (ii) following up on all decisions for action with, and updates from, implementing \nagencies and all concerned parties. \n \n27.  The  Department  of  Roads  (DOR),  DOTM,  KMC,  MOE,  and  MTPD  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. Each will be responsible for implementing project outputs under their \nauthority.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n30.  Technical viability is confirmed for improvement of the junctions.19 Priority areas have \nbeen carefully selected to save costs while maintaining most benefits. Beyond implementation, \nthe  implementing  agencies  must  ensure  the  sustainability  of  project  facilities  by  allocating \nsufficient budget for O&M. For civil works, a portion of the DOR and KMC O&M budget (at least \n2% of the respective project facilities construction cost per year) will be earmarked for O&M. To \nguarantee proper O&M for equipment provided through the project, (i) the MTPD equipment \nO&M cost will be built into the contract with the supplier, and a portion of the MTPD O&M \nbudget will be earmarked to 5% of the annual equipment cost; and (ii) the MOE will subcontract \nO&M of the repaired air quality monitoring stations to the private sector\u2014a corresponding \nbudget has been requested as part of the MOE Air quality Monitoring Action Plan, 2010\u20132013.    \n                                                 \n19  For the proposed improvement of the four junctions along the BLR, pre-feasibility studies have been undertaken by \nthe City Development Initiative for Asia. 2009. Completion of the Bishnumati Link Road. Manila. \n ", "8 \n31.  The charging of the electric vehicles to be operated on the pilot bus routes will be at risk \nbecause  of  frequent  load  shedding  and  weak  power  supply.  If  this  risk  worsens,  the \nreplacement of electric vehicles by other low emission vehicles will be considered. The project \nwill also equip the renovated air quality monitoring stations with solar power backup systems.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n32.  The project will contribute to improved public transport and traffic management, resulting \nin less congestion, accidents, noise pollution, and GHG emissions. It will have a significant \nimpact  on  the  environment  and  public  health.  Economic  analysis  has  been  conducted, \nmeasuring  the  reduction  in  vehicle  operating  costs.  The  project  has  been  found  to  be \neconomically viable, with economic internal rates of return of 13.2%\u201320.6%, higher than the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital. A financial internal rate of return assessment was only \nundertaken for the pilot bus routes component, as no other component will generate revenue. A \nconservative estimate of the financial internal rate of return for the pilot routes is positive at \n7.41%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.27%.20 \n \nC.  Governance \n33.  Assessments  of  financial  management  indicated  that  practices  in  the  MPPW  and \nimplementing agencies are generally sound, except for the DOTM and KMC whose financial \nmanagement  capacities  have  been  assessed  as  weak  (including  lack  of  experience  with \nprojects funded by donors  and development partners). Assessment of the financial condition of \nthe implementing agencies has shown that they are financially sustainable, except for KMC, \nwhich  the  PMCO  consultants  will  assist  to  strengthen  its  revenue  generation  capacity.  A \ngovernance risk assessment for the urban sector was undertaken with regard to public financial \nmanagement, procurement, and corruption as part of preparing a new CPS for Nepal in 2009. \nFinancial  management  risks  of  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  mitigated  through \nimprovement of the financial system and capacity development under the project (PMCO). The \nproject  intends  to  maximize  transparency,  including  procurement  and  financing  matters,  to \nreduce risks at central levels through the development and operation of a project website. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the government. The \nspecific policy requirements and measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  The project will benefit the poor and women through improvements to public transport, \nand is classified \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d Consideration will be given to such issues as \nthe design and construction of suitable bus stops for the elderly and the disabled (safe boarding \nand exiting), longer service hours, and the introduction of women-only buses. The poor will be \nthe main beneficiaries, as they are the main users of public transport. The project will also \nimprove pedestrian movement and traffic safety, benefiting the poor whose major modes of \ntransport are walking and cycling. \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The MPPW and the implementing agencies have prepared \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  subprojects  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study, \nincluding  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview framework has been prepared for the pilot routes subproject. The IEE found that the \nplanned subprojects, such as junction improvements along the BLR, would only have small and \nlocalized adverse impacts on the environment that can be mitigated.

Social safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement and category \nC  for  indigenous  peoples,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts are confined to junction improvements along \nthe BLR, and such impacts have been minimized through careful design. A resettlement plan \nhas been prepared for this subcomponent to ensure compliance with government and ADB \npolicy requirements. The PMCO will ensure that the DOR, the implementing agency for this \nsubcomponent, will update the resettlement plan during detailed design, and implement the final \nresettlement plan. Under the two pilot routes subproject, the project will construct four small bus \nterminals, whose locations on the outskirts of Kathmandu have not yet been determined. A \nresettlement framework has been prepared in the unikely case land acquisition is identified \nduring implementation and all steps required by ADB\u2019s resettlement policy will be followed, as \ndescribed in the PAM, before construction activities may proceed. The project will not trigger \nindigenous peoples safeguards listed in the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. Risks can be mitigated \nto a manageable level, and intended benefits of the project are expected to outweigh the costs.    \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPolitical instability, causing frequent strikes and  ADB  will  continue  close  dialogue  with  the  government  to \nblocking all motorized traffic, and thus affecting  ensure that the development and reform process will not be \nand delaying project implementation  derailed and keep its momentum despite political challenges.  \nLack of resources and capacity in the DOTM to  Project  management  and  capacity  building  consultants  will \nimplement  and  manage  the  project,  and  work  closely  with  the  DOTM  throughout  the  project.
