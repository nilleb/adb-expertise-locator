INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  a  country  programming  mission  in  May  2010,  the  Government  of  Bhutan \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide an additional technical assistance (TA) \ngrant to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory capacity of the Royal Monetary Authority of \nBhutan  (RMA). Two  previous  grants  had  been  approved  in  2003  and  1999.1 The request \nreflected the government\u2019s efforts to enhance resource mobilization and outreach capacity of \nthe financial sector as well as to promote economic and financial governance in accordance \nwith  the government\u2019s Tenth  Five-Year  Plan, 2008\u20132013.2 The TA  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan 2011\u20132013.3 \n \n2.  The mission visited Bhutan on 4\u20136 July 2011, and met with senior officials from the \nMinistry of Finance and RMA. The government and the mission reached an understanding on \nthe objectives, scope, financing plan, and implementation details of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Nonbank Financial Institution Architecture \n3.  Nonbank financial institutions account for 9.4% of total assets of the financial sector \nassets as of the end of FY2011. Meanwhile, the nonperforming loan ratio in the nonbank \nfinancial sector is currently estimated at 7% while that in the banking sector is estimated at 9.5%. \nThe two major nonbank financial institutions, Bhutan Development Bank and Royal Insurance \nCorporation of Bhutan, are deeply involved in commercial lending, due to limited investment \nopportunities in the domestic markets and profitability concerns. Bhutan Development Bank \nlends to private sector industrial clients; agricultural businesses; as well as micro, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. The absence of an enabling regulatory and supervisory framework \nfor the microfinance sector limits effective delivery of microfinance. Royal Insurance Corporation \nof Bhutan provides life and general insurance. It invests insurance premiums, and its investment \nportfolio is split into (i) credit products, (ii) equity investments, (iii) real estate, and (iv) liquid \nresources. Currently, there is no policy framework encompassing an insurance supervisory \nmechanism. \n \n4.  The  pensions  market  is  relatively  untapped  in  Bhutan.  The  National  Pension  and \nProvident Fund is comprised of a defined benefit pension plan (tier 1) and a defined contribution \nprovident fund (tier 2). The National Pension and Provident Fund runs the provident funds for \nthe armed forces, state-owned enterprises\u2019 employees, and the civil service. It is expected that \nthe organization will be allowed to offer pension products to private individuals in the future. \nCurrently, there is no pension regulation and no national pension scheme for the private sector \nor self-employed workers. \n \n5.  The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan Limited is subject to supervision by RMA, the \nacting securities commission. The exchange\u2019s rules are approved and amended by RMA. It is \ncurrently  regulated  by  provisions  under  the  Companies  Act  (2000),  Securities  Exchange \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2003.

To fill the gaps in the regulation and supervision of Bhutan\u2019s financial sector, RMA, as \nthe single regulator, was empowered to license, regulate, and supervise all financial service \nproviders. These gaps were especially pronounced in laws and regulations for insurance and \nsecurities exchanges. A comprehensive Financial Services Act (Act) was enacted in 2011 to \nbring banking, insurance, and securities activities under a unified legislative, regulatory, and \nsupervisory framework. In particular, RMA was given powers to address shortcomings and \nissues  in  regulation,  supervision,  and,  in  case  of  violations,  penalties  or  prosecution.  In \nconformity with international standards, the Act includes, among other things, (i) definition of \ninsurance solvency margins and admissibility of assets, (ii) securities trading and settlement \nprocedures for proper matching and delivery versus payment, (iii) on-site inspection procedure \nof securities exchanges, and (iv) issuer disclosure on control and related-party disclosure plus \nexpanded remedies for defective disclosure. In general, because the Act comprises integrated \nfinancial services legislation, chapters have been drafted to align with current international \nstandards in insurance, and securities. It includes, for example, sections entitled Objectives and \nPrinciples of Securities Regulation and Insurance Core Principles and Methodology.  \n \nB.  Limited Human Resource Development of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan \n7.  RMA is significantly constrained by limited human resource development in terms of \nregulating  and  supervising  nonbank  financial  institutions.  This  constraint  has  been  further \nexacerbated with the recent enactment of the new act, which has more detailed and specific \nprovisions for insurance and securities as compared to the previous Financial Institution Act. \nMoreover,  additional  new  provisions  are  being  prepared  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  ongoing \nprojects for pensions (pension policy, licensing or registration of pension providers, pension \nsupervisory framework) and microfinance (financial inclusion policy, regulatory and supervisory \nframework). The RMA supervisors and stakeholders therefore require specific training in the \ninsurance, securities, pension, and microfinance subsectors. \n \nC.  Persistence of Regulatory Gaps in the Nonbank Financial Institution Sector \n  \n8.  Regulatory  gaps  persist  despite  progress  in  developing  policies,  provisions,  and \nguidelines for the insurance, securities, pension, and microfinance subsectors. In the insurance \nsubsector, regulations need to be formulated on insurance brokerage, licensing of surveyors \nand loss assessors, criteria for actuary appointment, determination of insurance premium as \nwell  as  developing  reporting  formats  and  on-site  and  off-site  manuals.  In  the  securities \nsubsector, regulations are required in areas such as venture capital, mutual funds, subordinated \ndebt and corporate bonds, and derivatives. In the pension subsector, regulations are needed for \nvoluntary  saving  schemes  and  the  development  of  on-site  and  off-site  manuals.  In  the \nmicrofinance subsector, the development of on-site and off-site manuals is needed in addition to \nformulating the regulatory and supervisory framework. \n \nD.  ADB Support for Capacity Building of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan \n \n9.  ADB previously provided capacity development TAs in 1999 and 2003 to strengthen \nRMA\u2019s regulatory and supervisory capacity (footnote 1). The TA in 1999 effectively provided a \nframework for monitoring the health of the banking system by assisting RMA in conducting on-\nsite and off-site examination of banks, as well as formulating regulatory policy for banks. The TA \nin 2003 was successful in strengthening RMA\u2019s autonomy and supervisory function; building its \n ", "    3 \ngood  governance  capacity;  and  improving  the  regulatory  framework  for  RMA,  the  Royal \nSecurities Exchange of Bhutan Limited, and other financial institutions. Following successful \ncompletion of these two TA projects, a follow-up TA project is essential to develop the financial \nsector supervisory and regulatory system for nonbank financial institutions and, since this is an \narea that was not covered by the previous TAs, to address regulatory gaps in the nonbank \nfinancial institution sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved overall functioning of the financial sector in Bhutan. This will \nbe measured by a reduction of the nonperforming loans in the nonbank sector, an increase in \ncapital adequacy for the nonbank sector, an increase in pension coverage, and an increase in \nmicrofinance penetration. The outcome is enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of the financial \nsector supervisory and regulatory system for nonbank financial institutions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have two outputs: \n \n(i)  Improved  RMA  regulatory  and  supervisory  role.  This  will  assist  RMA  in \nsetting regulatory and financial supervisory policy that strikes the right balance in \nformulating effective nonbank financial regulations and rules that would support \nmarket development while enhancing stability of the Bhutanese financial system \nacross the insurance, pension, microfinance, and securities sectors. Training will \nalso  be  provided  to  enhance  RMA  staff  expertise  at  both management  and \ndepartmental levels in terms of drafting nonbank financial regulations as well as \nensuring effective implementation of these regulations. At least 10 regulations \npertaining to insurance, securities, pension, and microfinance activities will be \ncompleted and implemented under this component.  \n(ii)  Enhanced  capacity  of  financial  sector.  This will focus on training staff of \nnonbank  financial  institutions  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of,  and \ncompliance with, RMA\u2019s new nonbank rules and regulations. This component will \nalso focus on training staff from various financial sector entities to ensure they \nare updated about RMA\u2019s new nonbank rules and regulations and contribute to \nbroadening  the  expertise  and  capability  of  professionals  across the financial \nsector by disseminating nonbank financial sector knowledge.   \n \n12.  It is assumed that the government will continue to give high priority to support regulation \nand supervision practices and that adequate laws and regulations will be prepared on time. A \nmajor  risk  is  that  laws  and  regulations  will  not  be  properly  implemented  or  enforced.  An \nadditional risk would be the nonavailability of relevant staff from nonbank financial institutions \nand other financial sector entities for training purposes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000 (Appendix 2). The TA will be financed on a grant \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation and transport, remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions.  \n ", "4   \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  RMA will be the executing agency for the TA. It will provide (i) furnished office space for \nthe consultants, and access to a conference room; and (ii) local communication facilities for the \nconsultants in Thimphu. RMA will provide counterpart staff as necessary. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from May 2012 to May 2013. To achieve \nthe planned outcome, 5 international consultants and 1 national consultant will provide a total of \n24.5 person-months of consulting services. The TA will provide (i) one insurance supervision \nexpert focused on strengthening the regulatory capacity for supervising the insurance industry, \n(ii)  one  pension  supervision  expert  focused  on  strengthening  the  regulatory  capacity  for \nsupervising the pension industry, (iii) one capital market supervision expert with emphasis on \nstrengthening  regulatory  capacity  for  supervising  the  capital  market,  (iv)  one  microfinance \nsupervision  expert  focused  on  strengthening  the  regulatory  capacity  for  supervising  the \nmicrofinance industry, (v) one nonbank financial institutions supervision expert focused on off-\nsite  supervision  and  regulatory  policy,  and  (vi)  one  national  nonbank  financial  institutions \nsupervision expert to support all the international consultants. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Individual  consultants  will  be  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement \nwill be done in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Disbursement under the TA project will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  Each international consultant will submit an inception report to RMA and ADB within 2 \nweeks of the start of work and a draft final report 2 weeks before the end of the engagement. \nThe inception report and finalization of the draft final reports will be discussed at tripartite \nmeetings involving RMA, the consultants, and ADB. RMA will provide a brief report as to the \nprogress made in supervision activities on a yearly basis for the next 3 years. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $525,000 to the Government \nof  Bhutan  to  be financed  on  a grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund for Poverty  Reduction  for \nStrengthening  Royal  Monetary  Authority\u2019s  Regulatory  Capacity  for  Nonbank  Financial \nInstitutions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets     \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting  Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  Improve the capital  Royal Monetary  Political stability and \noverall functioning  adequacy ratio to a  Authority (RMA) annual  commitment to financial \nof the financial  satisfactory level of 18%  report  sector reforms \nsector in Bhutan  by 2015 (baseline is 16%     \nas of December 2010 for    Risk \nnonbank sector)     Economy significantly \n    affected by  negative \nReduce nonperforming  RMA annual report  external shocks \nloans in the     \nnonbank financial sector   \nto 5% by 2015 (baseline   \nis 7% in 2011)   \n   \nIncrease pension  RMA annual report \ncoverage of total   \nworkforce to 25% by 2015  Nonbank financial \n(baseline is 15% in 2011)  institutions\u2019 audited \n  annual reports \n   \nIncrease branch network  RMA annual report \nof nonbanks to 40 by   \n2015 (baseline is 33 in  Nonbank financial \n2011)  institutions\u2019 audited \n  annual reports \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced  efficiency  Increase frequency of on- RMA annual reports  Government will \nand  site inspections of    continue to give high \neffectiveness of the  nonbanks to once    priority to support \nfinancial sector  annually by May 2013    regulation and \nsupervisory and  (baseline is once every 2    supervision practices \nregulatory system for  years in 2011)     \nnonbank financial      Risk \ninstitutions  Establish an apex  RMA annual reports  Laws and regulations \nmicrofinance institution by    not properly \nMay 2013 (baseline is 0    implemented or \nin 2011)    enforced \n     \nLicense a securities  RMA annual reports \ncompany by May 2013   \n(baseline is 0 in 2011)   \n   \nLicense 3 more pension  RMA annual reports \nscheme managers and 3   \nThe views expressed hermeionr ea rfeu nthdo msea noaf gtheers c boyn sulta nt and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Direc2to0r1s5,  M(baansaeglineem iesn 1t,  or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \npension scheme manager \nand 0 fund manager in \n2011) \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n  Performance Targets     \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting  Risks  \nMechanisms  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
