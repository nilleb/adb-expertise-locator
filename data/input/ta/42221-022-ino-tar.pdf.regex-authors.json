INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Indonesia\u2019s long-term decentralization policy objectives are to improve the delivery of \nbasic services and infrastructure to local communities across the country. Since implementation \nof the \u2015big bang\u2016 decentralization reforms in 2001, the Government of Indonesia has entrusted \nlocal  governments  with  the  responsibility  of  delivering  most  basic  public  services,  and \nreassigned two-thirds of its civil servants and more than 16,000 service delivery facilities to the \nlocal governments. Central government transfers to local governments now account for a third \nof total central government expenditures.  \n \n2.  Local  service  delivery  is  mostly  financed  with  government  grants,  with  growing \ncontributions from local revenues and borrowings. The largest unconditional grant available to \nlocal governments is the general allocation fund (DAU), which accounts on average for 50% of \ntotal local governments revenues. The local governments\u2019 share of revenues from extractive \nindustries\u2014through the revenue sharing fund\u2014represents 17% of their revenues; an additional \n7% is accounted for by the infrastructure development grant (the specific allocation fund [DAK]). \nTotal grants to local governments have more than doubled since 2005, from an estimated \nRp150 trillion to around Rp350 trillion in 2010. In 2010 local revenue, from limited taxes and \ncharges, represented approximately 16% of total local governments\u2019 revenue. However, recent \nassignments  of  new  sources  of  revenue  to  local  governments  are  likely  to  increase  the \nimportance of this building block of local governments\u2019 financing. \n \n3.  The post-program partnership framework of the recently approved loan for the Second \nLocal  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Subprogram  2  (LGFGR2-S2)1  for \nIndonesia calls for (i) further improvement in the equalization power of the system of inter-\ngovernmental fiscal grants, (ii) continued implementation of the decentralization of the property \ntransfer tax (BPHTB) and land and building tax (PBB) to local governments, and (iii) sustained \ncapacity development of public financial management (PFM) for local government officers. To \nbuild on this reform momentum, the government has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for capacity development technical assistance (TA) to support implementation of policy \nobjectives under the LGFGR2-S2 post-program partnership framework. ADB fielded the fact-\nfinding mission in July 2011 and reached detailed understanding with the government on the \nobjectives and scope of the TA, the terms of reference for consultants, and the cost and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  After 10 years of decentralization, local governments have assumed a critical role in \npublic service delivery, and the overall quality of and access to basic public services have \nimproved. However, many challenges remain. Access to basic services remains uneven across \nthe country. A large number of local governments do not have the means to meet their service \nmandates due to low revenue-generating capacity and inefficient distribution of fiscal transfers. \nIn areas where central and local governments have shared responsibilities, there is a great deal \nof  overlap  and  confusion.  The  intergovernmental  coordination  institutions  remain \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof Indonesia for the Second Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program (Subprogram 2). Manila. \n(Loan 2786-INO). \n ", "2 \n \nunderdeveloped and ineffective. As a consequence, local government lacks the incentive to \nimplement prudent fiscal management, resulting in poor local government performance. \n \n5.  Lack of clarity in the legal framework. A comprehensive reform of the policy and \nregulatory  framework  for  the  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  in  Indonesia  is \nunderway. The review includes a revision of all the system\u2019s main elements: (i) expenditure and \nrevenue assignments, (ii) intergovernmental fiscal grants, and (iii) local government\u2019s borrowing \npowers. The reforms include amendments to the main decentralization laws (i.e., Law 32 on \nregional autonomy and Law 33 on fiscal balance) and associated government regulations, and a \nreconsideration of the mechanisms for new local government formation. Despite this progress, \nmore clarity is still needed on expenditure assignments, the institutional framework for policy \ncoordination at the central government level, and the processing of applications for new regions. \nProgress is pending upon the approval of the new amended Law 32.  \n \n6.  Lack  of  revenue  collection  capacity  by  local  governments.  Successful  fiscal \ndecentralization requires the assignment of adequate sources of own-source revenues to local \ngovernments. Indonesia has recently taken critical steps in this direction. Gradual devolution of \nthe PBB and the BPHTB started in January 2011 upon enactment of Law 34 on regional \ngovernment revenues and charges. The government plans to fully devolve the BPHTB by the \nend of 2011 and expects to complete the devolution of the PBB by 2014. However, ongoing \ninstitutional strengthening of revenue collection agencies will be needed. Administering land and \nproperty  taxes  is  cumbersome,  involving  sometimes  complex  mapping  and  valuation  and \ncollection techniques, which are increasingly managed by sophisticated computer applications. \n \n7.  Need for enhanced equalization, predictability, and transparency in the release of \nfiscal transfers and shared revenue. Despite progress, substantial flaws remain in the design \nand coordination of the different elements of the system of intergovernmental grants. The \nformula used for the allocation of the largest unconditional grant to local governments, the DAU, \nfails to properly estimate both the expenditure needs and fiscal capacity of local governments, \nand does not distinguish between type and size of local administrations. The DAK, the transfer \ndevoted to cover capital expenditure needs of local governments, suffers from poor targeting at \nthe sector and jurisdictional levels. Importantly, the different elements of the system of transfers \nare  not  properly  coordinated,  resulting  in  inefficiencies  in  resource  allocation  across  local \ngovernments.  Lastly,  none  of  the  major  grant  mechanisms  have  adequate  performance \nincentives incorporated in their design, thereby limiting their effectiveness. \n \n8.  Poor  financial  management  capacities  at  the  local  government  level.  The \ndecentralization process has placed an enormous burden on regional government officials. The \nnew intergovernmental arrangement inherited a large administrative and institutional burden, \nwith a multitude of public agencies, a lack of professional civil servants, uncertified accountants, \nweak public management systems, and graft and corruption at the local level. The latest data \n(2008) from the State Ministry for Administrative Reforms reveals that 50% of the country's four \nmillion civil servants had insufficient qualifications. Adequate capacity development of local \nauthorities  is  needed,  and  is  particularly  important  to  enhance  the  transparency  of  fiscal \ntransfers and the procurement process, and improve the capacity of regional government PFM \nofficers to handle property taxes.  \n \n \n   \n \n \n ", "3 \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n9.  The TA will build capacity in the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Home Affairs \n(MOHA), and the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) for the effective design \nand implementation of fiscal decentralization policies that are in line with LGFGR2-S2. This will \ninclude: (i) building the capacity of (a) the MOF Directorate General of Fiscal Balance (DGFB), \nwith  primary  focus  on  the  Directorate  for  Regional  Taxes  and  Charges,  and  (b)  regional \ngovernment PFM officials, for the efficient devolution of property taxes; (ii) assisting BAPPENAS \n(where  the  primary  counterpart  is  the  Directorate  of  Regional  Autonomy)  to  enhance \nequalization, predictability, and transparency in the allocation and release of on grant facilities, \nsuch as DAK; and (iii) improving the capacity of the regional  government PFM officials by \nengaging selected regional universities to provide PFM training.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be to improve access to and coverage of basic public services to local \ncommunities across the country. The outcome will be enhanced management and coordination \nof fiscal decentralization reforms by (i) efficient devolution of property taxes; (ii) rationalized and \nbetter-coordinated  approaches  to  key  intergovernmental  transfer  mechanisms;  and  (iii) \nimproved public financial management in local governments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Output 1: Efficient Devolution of Property Taxes  \n11.  The  devolution  of  the  two  main  property  taxes\u2014PBB  and  BPHTB\u2014to  the  local \ngovernments has commenced in the beginning of 2011, and is expected to be completed by \n2014. The transfer of BPHTB and PBB from central into local taxes is part of a process of \nproperty taxes decentralization reform, and is not a reform of the property taxes themselves. \nThe transfer will (i) improve the accountability of local governments to communities; (ii) increase \nthe fiscal autonomy of local finance; and (iii) maintain property records, data and information to \nsupport the certification of land. The continuation of the existing tax system is crucial, albeit at a \nlocal level, and there is no need to create a new property tax system. The existing property tax \nsystem  and  procedures\u2014the  Tax  Object  Information  Management  System  (SISMIOP)  and \nstandard operating procedures\u2014function quite well, and their transfer to local governments \nrequires  only  moderate  modifications  and  changes.  The  TA  will  assist  the  government  in \ntransferring SISMIOP and the standard operating procedures from the national to local level. \n \n12.  For the transition period to be effective, there needs to be proper sequencing and clear \ndelegation of responsibilities between the central and local governments to ensure that local \ngovernments have the ability to manage the two main property taxes. The TA will assist the \ngovernment (i)  develop  sustainable  support  by  designing regular  and  continuous  capacity-\nbuilding systems at the central and regional levels; (ii) issue clear guidelines for transferring staff \nfrom local tax offices to work for the local governments; (iii) provide a monitoring framework for \nlocal tax offices to ensure smooth implementation of PBB and BPHTB; (iv) develop guidelines \nfor PBB implementation that contain the draft regional regulation, and the draft regulation of the \nregent  or  mayor  containing  procedures,  business  processes  and  required  information \ntechnology;  (v)  develop  pilot  project  areas  to  implement  the  PBB  devolution  strategies, \nespecially those related to joint administration, during the transition period; and (vi) design a \nrollout package that will assist the local governments in managing PBB. \n \n ", "4 \n \n \n2.  Output  2:  Rationalized  and  Better-Coordinated  Approaches  to  Key \nIntergovernmental Transfer Mechanisms \n \n13.  This output will improve targeting of fiscal transfers and development of performance \nincentives for grant allocations. The TA will review international best practices and current \ndevelopment in Indonesia to rationalize the incentive systems and sanctions associated with \ngrant  distribution  and  monitoring.  Improved  targeting  of  transfers  by  sector  and  local \ngovernments  can  multiply  the  impact  of  available  funds  if  applied  to  priority  services  and \nlocalities. \n \n14.  The TA will seek to make the specific allocation grant (or DAK) more effective as a \ncapital grant and to study the enhancement of the Dana Insentif Daerah (performance-based \nfund). The TA will examine how to increase the efficiency of DAK utilization, as the existing DAK \nsystem does not: (i) provide the local governments with the information needed to execute DAK \nbudgets efficiently, (ii) take into account differences in local conditions when determining DAK \nallocation, and (iii) provide for DAK monitoring and evaluation. The TA will look at the long-term \nstrategy  for  the  Dana  Insentif  Daerah,  and  in  particular  how  to  integrate  incentives \narrangements into existing transfer mechanisms, particularly the DAU.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Improved Public Financial Management in Local governments. \n \n15.  This  output  will  center  around  capacity  building  of regional  officers  on  PFM.  Local \ngovernments lack professional PFM officers to manage their finances, with the result that \nfinancial management system efficiency remains low in many regions. Efforts have been made \nby both MOHA and MOF to implement a financial management information system. However, \nprogress has been slow due to (i) overlapping and complicated regulations issued by MOF, \nMOHA,  and  BAPPENAS;  (ii)  the  lack  of  budget  commitment  for  funding  the  needs  of \ndecentralized  capacity  building;  (iii)  a  lack  of  incentives  and  accreditation  for  regional \ngovernment finance experts; and (iv) the inability of local officials to access PFM training.  \n \n16.  To improve skills and expertise of the local governments and MOF on PFM issues, the \nTA will seek to increase cooperation between MOF and local regional universities, and seek \ninnovative way to teach PFM, such as through a distance learning facility. Currently, MOF has \nmanaged regional finance practices, regional finance training, and finance training for special \nregion public management courses in selected regional universities. However, engagement can \nbe  further  improved  through  (i)  consolidating  and  simplifying  the  PFM  regulatory  regime \nconfronting local governments, (ii) enhanced training in relation to core regulatory requirements, \n(iii) providing incentives for PFM officials to undertake professional study and training, (iv) \nimproving the regional finance training and regional finance practices program, (v) expanding \nthe  program\u2019s  size  and  outreach,  and  (vi)  promoting  e-learning  courses  and  opportunities \n(linked to professional accreditation) for regional government PFM staff. The TA will also assist \nin implementing financial management information systems in local governments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to cost $800,000. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing \naccommodation,  domestic  transportation,  office  space,  communications  facilities  for \n ", "5 \n \nconsultants, and other in-kind contributions. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are \npresented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.    The executing agency will be the MOF DGFB, which is responsible for overseeing fiscal \ndecentralization.  Implementing  agencies  will  include  BAPPENAS,  MOHA  and  local \ngovernments. The BAPPENAS Directorate of Regional Autonomy is responsible for the DAK \ndesign. The Directorate General of Regional Financial Management at MOHA bears important \nresponsibilities for the implementation of the regional financial management information system \nin  the  local  governments,  and  the  training  for  regional  government  officials  regarding  the \nsystem. The MOF Directorate of Funding Evaluation and Regional Information Management \nSystem is responsible for programming and dissemination of the regional financial information \nsystem  that  enables  local  governments  to  submit  financial  information  to  the  central \ngovernment. The DGFB Directorate for Regional Taxes and Charges is responsible for the \ndevolution of the land and building tax to local governments. The TA will start on April 2012 and \nend on April 2014.2 \n \n19.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will engage the consultants through \nquality-  and-cost-based  selection  (80:20).  Expressions  of  interest  solicited  from  qualified \nconsulting firms will establish the appropriate packaging of the consulting services (one or \nseveral packages, depending on market testing). A total of 58 (18 international and 40 national) \nperson-months of consultant services will be required. The consultants will be tasked with \nassisting the government in the efficient devolution of the property taxes, in developing a \nrationalized and better-coordinated approach to intergovernmental transfers, and building PFM \ncapacity among regional government officers. Appendix 3 presents outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants. Disbursements under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be done in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Any \nequipment to be purchased under the  TA will be transferred to the government upon TA \ncompletion. All consultant reports and deliverables as required under their terms of reference \nwill be delivered to the executing agency at the end of the TA. The consultant team, with the \nhelp of the executing agency, will be responsible in disseminating reports to the implementing \nagencies. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n   \n                                                \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 December 2011. \n \n \n \n ", "6      Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms \nImpact  250,000 more  BPS  Risk \nImproved access to  households gain access    Insufficient leadership and \nand coverage of  to piped water    ownership in local \nbasic public services  connections in 2017, from    governments to translate \nto local communities  a baseline of 10,370,451    institutional capacity \nin 2010    improvements into better \n    services and reduced poverty \n20% increased in the  Regional government   \nregional expenditure  budget data   Assumptions \ndevoted to both education    Continued commitment and \nand health in 2017    participation by national and \n(baseline in 2010 is Rp.  local governments in local \n1.18 billion).  government finance and \n  governance reforms \n   \nLocal governments use \nenhanced revenues to \nimplement infrastructure and \nsocial service projects \n \nParticipation by civil society \nand other stakeholders \nOutcome      Risk \nEnhanced  By 2015, a 10% increase  MOF website  and  Agencies unwilling to \nmanagement and  in land and building tax  research publications  implement reforms \ncoordination of fiscal  revenue collection from     \ndecentralization  2010 levels of Rp. 36.6  Budget documents,  Assumptions \nreforms  trillion.  policy dialogue,  Political and bureaucratic \n  workshops, and  momentum of reforms grows \n  review missions  with emergence of reform \nchampions \n \nFlexibility for change is \nmaintained at the margins, \neven if policies are completely \nreversed \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
