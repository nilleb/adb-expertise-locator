INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Outlook  (ADO)  is  a  flagship  publication  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) that showcases ADB\u2019s knowledge and expertise about the region. \nThe report\u2019s analysis provides insights into the economic issues faced by Asia and the Pacific, \nand appropriate policy responses. Its content informs ADB Management opinion and guides \ninstitutional views about the region\u2019s macroeconomic prospects and important development \nissues. As such, there is a need to continuously come up with a high-quality analysis to remain \na  relevant,  credible,  and  independent  source  of  information  about  the  region,  thereby \nmaintaining its usefulness and relevance to policy dialogues and formulation in ADB developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs).  The  production  of  the  ADO  has  been  regularly  supported  by \ntechnical assistance (TA) funding.1 The objectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the \nregional TA are in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The TA Strategic Forum 2008 recognized the important role that flagship publications \nsuch as the ADO play in monitoring the major economic issues and trends of ADB's DMCs. By \nregularly  providing  comprehensive  analysis  on  evolving  developments  in  DMCs,  the  ADO \nprovides a basis for understanding the key drivers of, and constraints on, economic growth\u2014a \ncritical element for inclusive economic growth, which is one of the priority research areas under \nStrategy  2020.3 Also,  under  ADB\u2019s  streamlined  business  processes,  the  ADO  has  been \nestablished as the main reference for the economic assessment and outlook section of country \npartnership strategies. \n \n3.  The ADO is one of the most frequently downloaded publications from ADB\u2019s website.4 It \nis a source of much international and national news commentary that features analysis, views, \nand opinions from ADB. Thus, a concerted effort to produce a high-quality publication every \nyear is vital to elevate the publication\u2019s profile and to ensure its relevance and usefulness in \nresearch and policy dialogues and formulation in ADB DMCs. \n \n4.  In addition to the country-by-country and regional economic analyses, the ADO in its \nrecent issues has featured timely topics on rebalancing growth, macroeconomic management \nbeyond the global financial crisis, South\u2013South economic links, and inequality in developing \nAsia. These are all important issues that have been brought to the fore in the wake of the recent \nglobal financial crisis. Discussion of these topics has important policy implications for developing \nAsia in sustaining long-term growth in the face of global uncertainties.  \n \n5.  In keeping with its aim to present the vital and contemporary issues pertinent to the \nDMCs while tackling one of the development agendas of the region as envisioned in Strategy \n2020, the theme chapter of ADO 2013 will be \u2015Ensuring Energy Security in Asia and the Pacific.\u2016 \n                                                \n1  ADO 2013 has been identified as a corporate priority TA in the 30 January 2012 memo on resource allocation for \ntechnical assistance operations in 2012. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 July 2012. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n4  From 2006 to 2012, the ADO and ADO Update have consistently ranked among the top ADB downloads from the \nmonth of launch until the following year. Their launches have regularly generated significant coverage from both \nglobal and regional top-tier media, such as the Financial Times, the Asian Wall Street Journal, and the International \nHerald Tribune. \n ", "2   \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s energy demand is projected to almost triple from 4,242 million tons of oil \nequivalent in 2007 to 11,480 million tons of oil equivalent by 2050, the highest rate among \nregions. Economies outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) would account for about 95% of the projected growth in global energy demand by 2050. \nThe rapid growth of Asia\u2019s energy demand over the next 3 decades will put extraordinary \npressure on securing energy sources (Asia being the most responsible for and affected by \nexcessive reliance on energy imports) and will generate a rapid increase in carbon dioxide \nemissions.5 Per  capita  energy  use  in  developing  Asia  is  about  a  third  that  of  developed \ncountries and the projected rapid growth reflects the catch-up effect. Asia needs increasing \nenergy supplies to sustain economic growth and development while energy resources are under \npressure and the current level of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions threatens our climate. \nEnergy  security  is  an  important  mission;  it  means  ensuring  long-term  supply  security  by \npromoting sufficient investment, ameliorating market volatility, and examining issues of energy \nbalance accountability. The theme chapter will examine the energy issues underlying the long-\nterm view of the region articulated in Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. In particular, it will \ndiscuss how much Asia\u2019s long-term growth will contribute to energy demand in Asia and the \nworld, how to ensure Asia\u2019s energy security, the implications for environmentally sustainable \ngrowth, options for switching to a cleaner and more efficient energy future, and the policies \nneeded to ensure energy security in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n6.  To motivate the discussion, the theme chapter will provide projections of developing \nAsia\u2019s energy demand and supply under high- and low-growth scenarios. It will present country \nand subregional demand\u2013supply analysis and will estimate the demand\u2013supply gap in Asia\u2019s \npower sector. Quantitative analysis to estimate energy demand reduction and carbon dioxide \nemission reduction through energy-efficiency-promoting policies for both high- and low-growth \nscenario  cases  will  also  be  conducted.  This  can  be  the  basis  of  an  assessment  of  the \nmacroeconomic impacts on gross domestic product and employment generation, and financial \nimpacts on energy bill savings of energy efficiency programs.  \n \n7.  Finally, the theme chapter will draw conclusions about advantages and drawbacks of \ndifferent  policies.  This  analysis  should  enable  countries  embarking  on  energy  demand \nmanagement policies to benefit from the experience of other countries. The effect of the gradual \nrationalization of fossil-fuel subsidies on the energy mix, as well as its impacts on the macro \neconomy and households, will also be discussed. Based on the analyses above, concrete and \nspecific policy directions on how developing Asia as a region can ensure energy security and \npromote sustainable and low-carbon economic growth will be recommended. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be for the ADO to influence the environment within which policy \nformulation in selected DMCs occurs. The outcome will be citations of the ADO by the media, \nand by economic researchers within and outside ADB. Appendix 2 contains the outline of ADO \n2013 and ADO 2013 Update. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2011. Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Manila. \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The main outputs of the TA will be the disseminated ADO 2013, ADO 2013 Update, and \nADO  Supplement  reports.6 The  TA  will  support  the  following  key  activities:  (i)  preparing \nbackground analytical papers; (ii) further developing and refining analytical methods; (iii) drafting \nADO content; (iv) economic editing and copyediting; (v) preparing and laying out materials for \npublication; and (vi) disseminating key results and policy messages. The TA will also support \ninitiatives to build capacity for macroeconomic modeling, generating growth projections, and \nmonitoring markets. These initiatives will be linked to a bigger plan within the Economics and \nResearch Department (ERD), which aims to build a \u2015modeling culture\u2016 within ADB, and will \ninclude economists in the regional departments, especially those involved in the preparation of \nthe  country  chapters,  and  possibly  the  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration.  Several \nactivities for the preparation of ADO 2014 may be supported under the TA.  \n \n10.  ERD must work continuously to improve the analytical rigor and policy relevance of the \nreport if it is to remain a credible, independent source of knowledge and information about Asia \nand  the  Pacific.  Background  research  papers  to  provide  a  solid  empirical  and  analytical \nfoundation for ADO content will be produced under the TA. These papers will supplement the \nresearch work of the Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) on the selected \ntheme topics, analyzing issues and policy implications for the DMCs covered. These papers will \nbe consolidated in an edited research volume to provide researchers with more extensive \nbackground information and analyses related to the theme topic. The research volume may be \ncopublished with a reputable publishing house and will likely entail a buyback arrangement. \n \n11.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  and  refinement  of  analytical  methods  to \nsupplement ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. This will \nstrengthen the economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs, \nthereby creating better-informed and better-designed economic policies and enhancing ADB\u2019s \ncountry assistance. \n \n12.  Workshops and conferences will be organized as part of ADO preparation to strengthen \nthe content. The writers\u2019 workshop will focus on macroeconomic analysis of current issues, \ngrowth accounting, economic projections and macroeconomic modeling, and effective writing \nskills. The workshop will target selected economists and national staff in regional departments \nand resident missions who are responsible for writing the country chapters. This will also impart \nskills that are of broader relevance to the economic and sector work, which underpins country \nstrategies. The conferences will focus on the reports\u2019 theme chapters. Distinguished economists \nfrom the region will be invited to discuss initial drafts of the background papers to improve the \nanalytical rigor and policy relevance of the theme chapters. \n \n13.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the different parts \nof the ADO and the edited volume of background research papers, high-quality editing services \nwill be provided by international consultants.  \n \n14.  The publications will be widely disseminated in collaboration with the Department of \nExternal Relations (DER). The international media launch will be followed by presentations \ncohosted by ADB development partners within and outside Asia and the Pacific. The outreach \n                                                \n6  The ADO Supplement is a short report jointly initiated with the Office of Regional Economic Integration to produce \nquarterly updates of macro forecasts between ADO and ADO Update releases.  \n ", "4   \nwill include analytical discussions of the issues in partnership with academic institutions and \nthink tanks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nGiven the high institutional profile of the ADO, the chief economist will report to the vice-\npresident for knowledge management and sustainable development and the President at critical \npoints in the publications\u2019 preparation. The TA is expected to start in September 2012 and be \ncompleted by 30 June 2014. \n \n17.  The production of the ADO will be a joint effort (led by ERMF) of ERD economists, \ncountry  economists  of  the  regional  departments  and  resident  missions,  national  experts, \ninternational consultants, and economics editors. As in previous years, ERMF will collaborate \nwith regional departments and resident missions on the preparation of the country chapters. \nERD  will  also  coordinate  with  the  energy  divisions  of  the  regional  departments  and  the \ncommunity of practice on energy in the preparation of the theme chapter. The theme topic for \nthe ADO 2013 Update will be decided after consultations with the regional departments and \nManagement. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  16  person-months  of  international  consultancy  resources  for \neconomists who will prepare the background papers and analyses on the issue of the theme \ntopic. In addition, the TA will require an estimated 24 person-months of international economic \nadvisory  and  editing  consultants\u2019  time  for  the  economic  and  technical  editing  of  ADO \nmanuscripts before final publication of ADO 2013 and ADO 2013 Update. The TA will also \nrequire 7 person-months of national economic consultants\u2019 time to assist in conducting research \non  different macroeconomic  topics,  and another  13  person-months  will  be  needed for  the \ndesktop publishing and graphic design requirements of the publication. Consultants will be hired \nas individuals.7 Resource persons will be engaged to conduct training on macroeconomics and \neconomic forecasting and may also serve as discussants during the workshops. Consultants \nand resource persons will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants and resource persons are in Appendix 4.   \n \n19.  The TA will finance the procurement of information and knowledge services, such as \nsubscription to macroeconomic data providers (e.g., Bloomberg), as may be required to support \nrelevant and up-to-date content. Equipment such as computers and software to support the \nmacroeconomic modeling work will be purchased by ADB in accordance with its Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of \nInformation  Systems  and  Technology  and  the  Office  of  Administrative  Services,  where \n                                                \n7  The TA will involve independent studies and require rapid mobilization of consultants to ensure that there are no \ndelays in the tight production schedule of the publications. In addition, the experience and qualifications of the \nindividual consultants will be the primary considerations. Thus, the consultants will be hired on an individual basis.  \n ", "  5 \napplicable. All computer equipment purchased under the TA will remain ADB\u2019s property even \nafter TA account closing, until disposed of.8 Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n20.  Workshops will be conducted to review and discuss the initial country chapters and \nbackground papers prepared for the ADO. These are tentatively scheduled for December 2012, \nFebruary 2013, May 2013, and July 2013 at the ADB headquarters. The TA may cover travel \nexpenses of selected resident mission staff participating in the workshops as resource persons. \n \n21.  The TA will support the dissemination activities of ERD and DER. The major results and \nkey policy messages emerging from the ADO 2013 and ADO 2013 Update will be disseminated \nto  the  media,  DMC  policymakers,  and  academic  communities.  The  media  launch  and \nsubsequent  road  shows  will  be  undertaken  by  ERD  in  coordination  with  DER.  Separate \nlaunches will be undertaken by resident missions in selected DMCs in coordination with their \nregional departments and DER. Roundtable discussions and workshops in different academic \nand economic institutions will also be conducted to reach a wider audience. Both ADO 2013 and \nADO  2013  Update  will  be featured  on the  ADB  website  and  copies,  either  in  print  or  on \nCD-ROMs, will be distributed worldwide. ADO Supplement reports will be produced in between \nthe publication of the ADO and the ADO Update to provide updated assessment on the DMCs. \nThe TA may also support the translation of the ADO into other languages, as may be required, \nto  support  dissemination  activities  in  selected  DMCs.  This  will  be  arranged  by  regional \ndepartments in coordination with the concerned resident missions and DER. \n \n22.  As team leader, the assistant chief economist (ACE), ERMF will monitor the work under \nthe  TA  to  ensure  its  effective  implementation.  ERD  researchers  will  review  the  work  of \nconsultants  engaged  to  verify  that  tasks  are  completed  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of \nreference, and that draft reports are delivered on time, with the ACE, ERMF managing the \ncombined outputs of the consultants. Peer review of papers within ADB and, if possible, by \nother research and academic institutions will also be used as a tool to evaluate the quality and \ndepth of analysis of the research papers. ACE, ERMF will set the production schedule, assure \nthat adequate staff are assigned, and be responsible for meeting the deadlines for the timely \ndelivery of publications. The success of the dissemination activities will be monitored through \nweb download statistics and media monitoring reports provided by DER. \n \n23.  Evaluation of outputs and outcomes will be done to help measure the success of the TA. \nERMF evaluation of the overall ADO process will be conducted to determine strengths and \nweaknesses as well as areas for improvement that will serve as inputs for the next ADO. \nMonitoring and back-to-office reports on the ADO and ADO Update launches will also be \nreviewed to gather feedback on the publications and learn lessons from them. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Asian Development Outlook 2013, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n8  In  accordance  with  ADB.  2009.
