Following a request from the Government of Uzbekistan for Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) assistance for preparing a project to improve rural water supply services, technical \nassistance (TA) was included in ADB's operational program for 2004.1 The TA Fact-Finding \nmission visited Uzbekistan from 22 March to 5 April 2004 for field visits and discussions with the \ngovernment officials concerned. The Mission coordinated its work with the Islamic Development \nBank (IDB), as the Government has requested cofinancing from IDB. The Mission reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA's objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing \nplan, terms of reference, and implementation schedule and arrangements. A preliminary project \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan is suffering from poor water supply and sanitation services and a shortage of \nsafe drinking water, especially in the rural areas. This has many undesirable consequences. \nConsumers incur significant time costs and inconvenience in coping with poor services; many \ncollect water from rivers, irrigation channels, and wells. Unsafe water and sanitation services \nare responsible for deteriorating public health and increasing expenditure on health, with the \npoor being affected most. The inadequate water supply and sanitation systems result from \ndeficient design, use of inferior construction materials and methods, damaged water supply \nequipment, the collapse of institutional arrangements due to the country\u2019s economic transition, \nand insufficient maintenance and rehabilitation. Given the lack of funds and the poor state of \nrepair of sector facilities, the quality of water and sanitation services will continue to deteriorate. \nThe current water supply coverage of 65% of the rural population is planned to be increased to \n90% by 2010. There is an urgent need to upgrade and expand the rural water supply and \nsanitation  services.  The  capacity  of  the  water  users  associations  (WUAs)  and  local \ngovernments to implement projects and undertake the operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nfacilities also needs to be enhanced.  \n \n3.  Since independence in 1991, Uzbekistan has been making a difficult transition to a \nmarket-based  economy.  However,  the  sharp  decline  in  output  since  independence  has \ncontributed  significantly  to  an  increase  in  poverty.  The  economic  transition  has  been \naccompanied by increasing inequity in income distribution. The situation is even more obvious \nwhen access to social infrastructure services such as safe and reliable water supply is taken \ninto account. Health and demographic indicators confirm the presence of greater levels of \nhuman deprivation in rural areas. The social and economic costs of the current transition have \nbeen sharp and immediate. Closing of facilities, privatization of public enterprises, and falling \nbudget for the social sectors have resulted in service disruption and major price increases for \nthese services. Social spending, including social assistance and provision of social services \nincluding water supply and sanitation, has declined sharply. \n \n4.  The Government is conscious of the urgent need to improve rural water services through \npolicy and institutional reforms and the repair and upgrading of existing infrastructure. The \nGovernment  has  prepared  a  national  strategy  for  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector, \nincluding specific targets, action plans, and a medium-term sector investment program. The \nsector  strategy  includes  (i)  improving  the  capabilities  of  WUAs  and  local  governments  in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 March 2004.   \n ", " 2  \nadministration, financial management, and O&M; (ii) integrating water supply development with \nthe improvement of sanitation facilities; and (iii) increasing access to safe and reliable water \nsupply and sanitation services. In consultation with aid agencies, the Government has adopted \na community management approach for the delivery of rural water and sanitation services to \nensure their sustainability.  \n \n5.  The project area will cover two oblasts: Kashkadarya and Navoi. These oblasts were \nselected because of an urgent need to improve the poor condition of their basic rural water \nsupply and sanitation facilities. About 730 villages from a total of 1,700 villages in the two \noblasts are without safe and reliable water supply and sanitation services. Of the 730 villages, \nabout half need their water supply systems rehabilitated and the other half require new systems. \nThe proposed Project is expected to cover about 500 of the most needy and poorest rural \ncommunities, each with a population of 200\u20136,000 people. In total, the Project will cover about \n500,000 people. \n \n6.  ADB will assist the Government to improve water supply and sanitation services in the \nrural areas. This will include helping to formulate and implement the national sector strategy for \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  the  sustainable \nmanagement of sector facilities, improve the quality and efficiency of safe water and sanitation \nservices, and rehabilitate and develop rural water supply and sanitation facilities. The Project \nwill enhance rural water supply and sanitation coverage, and contribute to improving living and \nhealth conditions, as well as the institutional capabilities of WUAs and local governments. \nImproving the health conditions of the poorest, in addition to addressing poverty reduction \ndirectly, will also lessen the fiscal burden on local and central governments in the future, and \nthus contribute to a better allocation of resources in the economy. The TA is needed to prepare \nthe Project and a program of capacity building for WUAs and local governments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The main objectives of the TA are to (i) analyze and propose measures to strengthen \nrural water supply and sanitation development programs in the two oblasts; (ii) prepare a \nprogram for capacity building of local governments; (iii) prepare subprojects for upgrading water \nsupply  and  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iv)  prepare  a  Project  for  possible  external  financing \ncovering about 500 communities with populations ranging from 200 to 6,000 persons, and \nincrease the service coverage in the two selected provinces to 90% by 2010. About half of the \nvillages will be covered by groundwater supply systems serving 1\u201315 villages and the other half \nwill be served by linking them to group water pipelines or interregional trunk mains.  \n \n8.  The Project will fulfill the immediate demand for potable water supply and safe sanitation \nservices in the project area. The Project will cover (i) rehabilitation and extension of piped water \nsupply services; and (ii) sanitation, including public bathhouses, and private and school latrines. \nThe stakeholders and beneficiaries will participate in designing the Project through consultations \nand socioeconomic surveys that will be undertaken for all subprojects. During project design, \nconsultations  with  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  will  include  women\u2019s  groups  and  poor \ncommunities in the project area. The Project will address poverty reduction, social aspects, and \ngender issues. \n ", "      3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will consist of two parts: part A\u2014review and strengthening of the two oblasts' \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  sector  investment  programs,  and  part  B\u2014preparation  of  an \ninvestment project. \n \n10.  Part A: Review of the Oblasts' Sector Investment Programs. The two oblasts' water \nsupply and sanitation sector programs will be reviewed. The review will include an assessment \nof physical, institutional, and human resources required for the Project and cover a description \nof the present facilities, planned future coverage, cost recovery, O&M arrangements, private \nsector involvement, and related policies. The review will pay particular attention to integrated \nwater resources management and environmental concerns to ensure the protection of water \nresources at the regional and local levels. \n \n11.  Part B: Preparation of the Investment Project. The TA consultants will prepare the \nProject, including appropriate capacity-building measures. The feasibility study will cover (i) the \ntechnical,  economic,  and  financial  feasibility  of  subproject  components;  cost  estimates; \nimplementation  schedule  for  components;  and  preliminary  engineering  design;  (ii)  poverty, \nsocial, and gender analysis; and community participation; and (iii) environmental considerations. \nThe poverty analysis will include the collection of detailed information on the incidence of \npoverty in the two oblasts.  \n \n12.  The Project will be based on consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries, the \nestimated demand for water supply and sanitation services in the project area, and the service \ndelivery capacity of the participating WUAs and local governments. Project formulation, with \nattention  to  financing  aspects  (local  and  central),  will  include  analysis  of  cost  recovery; \ncommunity  ownership;  private  sector  participation;  financing  options;  fiscal  impact;  and \nsustainability (technical, financial, and institutional) for all subprojects. Analysis of the Project\u2019s \nimpact on poverty reduction will also be undertaken. The consultants will undertake project \nframework analysis, including problem and solution analysis, to assist in the design of the \nProject and the selection of indicators for monitoring during implementation. The TA consultants \nwill coordinate their work with two ongoing ADB-financed loan projects\u2014Urban Water Supply \nProject,2 and Western Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply Project,3 and the ongoing TA on Capacity \nBuilding for Urban Water Supply.4  \n \n13.  The TA will formulate the Project at an indicative total estimated cost of about $70.0 \nmillion, partly for external financing. The Government has asked ADB to consider a loan for \nabout $40.0 million for the construction of new water supply systems and rehabilitation of \nexisting systems in the two oblasts. The Government has also requested cofinancing from IDB \nfor a loan of about $15.0 million for the construction of a gravity flow pipeline from Damkhodjent \ntrunk water main for Navoi oblast.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001.

The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $825,000  equivalent,  comprising  $380,000  in  foreign \nexchange costs, and $445,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nrequested ADB to provide $575,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$195,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government has agreed to provide the \nbalance of local currency cost, equivalent to $250,000, in cash and kind for counterpart staff, \noffice  space,  furniture,  administrative  support  services,  and  logistics.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) will be the Executing Agency of the \nTA. UCSA will chair the TA steering committee, which will include representatives from the \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture and \nWater  Resources,  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  Oblast  governments,  and  other  agencies  as \nappropriate,  to  ensure  that  their  views  are  adequately  considered  and  necessary  support \nprovided. The TA office will be headed by UCSA and will include staff from all the other agencies \ninvolved to maintain coordination and ensure consultants\u2019 access to relevant project information \nand data, and to liaise with ADB on matters relating to TA implementation. To optimize logistical \nand economic efficiency, the existing project management unit for the Urban Water Supply \nProject (footnote 2), with additional staffing, will be used as the TA office and the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) for the proposed Project. The Government will provide the consultants \nwith a suitably furnished office with utilities, telecommunication access, materials, maps, data, \nand all required documents. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented during 7 months, from October 2004 to April 2005. The total \nconsultant  input  is  estimated  at  72  person-months:  12  international  and  60  domestic.
