INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Country Programming Mission in December 2007, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) confirmed its request for assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nfinance the proposed Chongqing Urban\u2013Rural Infrastructure Development Demonstration Project. \nFinancing will be under a sector loan to improve infrastructure facilities and municipal services, \nsupport employment generation, improve rural living conditions, and reduce poverty in a range of \ntowns and villages. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is scheduled for processing \nin 2008.1  A Fact-Finding Mission was conducted from 20 May\u20135 June 2008 in Chongqing. This \nreport is based on the understanding reached with the Government regarding the impact and \noutcome,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA, as well as the Mission\u2019s observations. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government of the PRC aims to increase economic productivity and narrow the urban\u2013\nrural income gap through coordinated development of urban and rural areas. The 11th Five-Year \nProgram (2006\u20132010) of the Government and Chongqing municipality identified urbanization as a \nkey  development  objective,  with emphasis  on  balancing  regional  development  and  promoting \ngrowth  with  equity  by  coordinating  urban\u2013rural  infrastructure  improvements  and  strengthening  \ndevelopment of urban settlements around metropolitan areas. The Chongqing municipality\u2019s 11th \nFive-Year  Program  also  seeks  \u201cto  considerably  improve  production  and  living  conditions  for \npoverty-struck regions and minority nationality regions.\u201d2 This approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nstrategic priorities in the PRC.  \n \n3.  The PRC National Development and Reform Commission (DRC) has identified Chongqing \nas the key city for coordinated and comprehensive reform in urban and rural areas. Chongqing \nmunicipality, in turn, has adopted the strategies of \u201cSuitable Centralization and Linkages in One \nRegion\u201d  and  \u201cone  ring  two  wings\u201d.3 These  strategies  integrate  urban  and  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment  objectives  to  create  more  balanced  development  and  narrow  the  urban\u2013rural \neconomic gap. Poor road infrastructure, which restricts access within and between towns, and the \nlack of a clean and reliable water supply inhibit economic growth and poverty alleviation. The \nstrategy of urban\u2013rural integrated infrastructure development will adopt a proactive approach to \nmaximize the benefits of urbanization through parallel development of rural towns. Coordinated \nurban\u2013rural infrastructure development will improve productivity and lead to more effective, better \nmanaged, and more efficient subregional municipal services.  \n \n4.  Chongqing is located in the southern central part of the PRC, between the Qingzang \nhighlands and the plains of the middle and lower Yangtze River.4 It borders the provinces of \nGuizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, and Sichuan and is a major hub for water, land, and air transport. \nChongqing covers an area of 82,400 square kilometers (km) and comprises 19 districts and 21 \ncounties.5 Chongqing\u2019s population at the end of 2006 was 31.98 million, comprising mainly Han \nChinese with a significant mix of other ethnicities.6 Three of the 14 districts or counties in which \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2008. \n2   The 11th Five-Year Program states that 60% of communities shall be connected by metalled roads and difficulties in \nobtaining potable water shall be eliminated. \n3   The \u201cone ring two wings\u201d strategy refers to the economic ring forming the core city area of Chongqing and the two wing \nareas of west Chongqing municipal region and the eastern Yangtze River region. \n4   Chongqing was granted provincial status, reporting directly to the state government, in 1996. \n5   The  district  area  has  a  higher  gross  domestic  product  than  the  county  area  although  both  are  second  tier \nadministrations reporting to Chongqing municipal government. \n6   The total ethnic minority population for 2006 was 1.73 million, of whom Tujia and Miao groups represented 3.6% and \n1.8% of the total population, respectively. ", "2 \nsubprojects are proposed are autonomous, with ethnic minority majorities.  The urban population of \nChongqing represents 46.7% of the province\u2019s total population. In the 14 subproject districts or \ncounties, the urban population averages only 16.5% and the total rural population is 10.1 million. \nIncome levels across Chongqing lag behind those of the coastal areas of the PRC. In 2006, about \n1.6 million rural people (9.6% of the total rural population of Chongqing) lived on low incomes and \n504,300 rural people (5.0% of the total rural population of the 14 districts or counties) lived on \nincomes below the official absolute poverty line.7 Twelve of the 14 districts or counties included in \nthe proposed project are listed as critical by the PRC for poverty aid development. Challenging \ngeological and topographical conditions, and an under-developed local economy have restricted \nthe construction of infrastructure facilities in these poorer rural regions. An indigenous peoples \nassessment concluded that category A is applicable. \n \n5.  The proposed sector project comprises about 70 discrete components, located across 14 \ndistrict or county administrative areas. All subprojects will support approved development master \nplans and sector programs. The subprojects cover two sectors: roads and potable water supply. \nRoads will be located in urban and rural areas and will vary in standard from class III to class IV. \nThe roads subprojects seek to (i) improve the existing road infrastructure and reduce accidents in \ntowns; (ii) assist commercial access for trade promotion; (iii) improve access from and between \nvillage communities and urban centers; (iv) reduce the cost of transporting farm inputs to rural \ncommunities,  and  farm  products  to  markets;  (v)  improve  access  to  social  services,  such  as \nschooling and medical services; and (vi) improve incomes and living standards in poor areas. The \nwater supply subprojects will (i) provide treatment and improve piped potable water supplies to \nurban and rural populations; (ii) facilitate the planned expansion of towns to provide manufacturing \njobs; (iii) improve the health of the local population and reduce productivity losses caused by \nillness; and (iv) strengthen the local economy, increase employment, and reduce poverty. All water \nsupply subprojects have planned parallel projects for wastewater collection and treatment, which \nwill be funded by the Chongqing municipal government (CMG). A rapid environmental assessment \nproposed that a category A assessment be conducted since the project will impact urban and rural \ncommunities by constructing new roads, upgrading existing tracks, constructing pipelines, and \nestablishing new ground water sources.   \n \n6.  The roads subprojects will construct a total of 980 km of roads of varying widths and \ncapacities that will directly benefit about 760,000 people. Of this total length, 509 km will be new \nroads while 471 km of existing roads will be upgraded, many of which are no more than rough \nstone tracks. Included in the project are 26 bridge structures, with a total length of 1,200 meters, \nand 354 culverts. The water supply subprojects involve the treatment of an additional 168,650 \ncubic meters per day of raw water from reservoir sources and ground water springs, and the \nexpansion of transmission and distribution pipe networks to supply potable water across 17 towns, \nbenefiting more than 590,000 people. Construction will involve a total land acquisition of about 200 \nhectares and resettlement of 427 households, or about 1,280 people. An involuntary resettlement \ninitial assessment concluded that the project is category B. \n \n7.  The  proposed  sector  project  will  develop  selected  towns  and  provide  vital  links  with \nsurrounding rural communities. The project will assist CMG\u2019s development program and reduce the \nincidence  of  poverty.  Institutional  strengthening  and  a  sustainable  approach  to  utility  service \nprovision at the district level will form the cornerstone of the project. Improved road access will link \nrural communities directly with markets, increasing incomes, reducing costs through transport \nsavings, and providing access to jobs in the towns. Improvements to the quality of the water supply \n                                                 \n7  The official absolute poverty line in 2005 was CNY786 per capita per year. In 2007 the poverty line was raised to \nCNY1,067 per capita per year, but continued to be lower than the international standard of $1 per capita per day. The \n4.95% national poverty incidence equates to 64.32 million people. ", "3 \nwill reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases and associated medical costs, and provide \ncommunities more opportunities for food processing and other economic activities. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s strategy is to help the PRC build a harmonious society and boost rural development. \nThe  proposed  project  focuses  on  ADB's  Strategy  2020  (2008\u20132020)  and  PRC\u2019s  Country \nPartnership Strategy (2008\u20132010):8 promoting efficient infrastructure, strengthen environmental \nmanagement, and support inclusive growth and balanced development (to help the Government \nbuild a xiaokang [moderately well-off] society) by supporting sustainable urban\u2013rural integrated \ndevelopment. The project will develop markets and create jobs by supporting urbanization and \nimproving access from villages to towns, while still protecting the environment. Rural communities \nare expected to benefit from the project\u2019s poverty reduction activities. In 2007, 2,000 poor villages \nexperienced water shortages while 687 villages suffered from limited access to roads, limiting \nresidents\u2019 opportunities to market farm products, seek employment, and access education and \nhealth facilities.   \n \n9.  The project will develop sustainable municipal infrastructure, increase economic activity and \nemployment,  and  protect  the  environment  in  the  poorer  eastern  regions  of  Chongqing.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to provide a $100 million loan to support the project. ADB has \nadopted a participatory approach, under which town and village stakeholders have identified the \nmajor problems in their areas and highlighted actions needed to address those problems.9 The \nproject is justified on the basis of supporting the poor by improving their economic and social \nconditions, raising living standards, reducing health risks, and supporting the national and regional \ninfrastructure  development  strategies.  Numerous  internationally-supported  agricultural  and \ninfrastructure  projects  are  either  under  construction  or  have  been  completed  across  the \nmunicipality and the necessary implementation capacity exists within CMG. Those projects will be \nreviewed to draw relevant lessons for the ensuing loan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be improved water supply facilities and services, and efficient \nurban\u2013rural transport infrastructure within and between 63 towns and villages in 14 districts or \ncounties  in  the  mountainous  eastern  regions  of  Chongqing.  The  total  length  of  roads  to  be \nconstructed or improved is 980 km. The total additional water supply treated will be 168,650 cubic \nmeters per day, which will require new and reconstructed pipelines totaling 531 km. The project\u2019s \noutcome will be a sector project design agreed to by the PRC and ADB, and the completion of the \nfeasibility study reports (FSRs). The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1, lasting 2 months, will comprise \nstudies to (i) assess constraints to economic development, adverse environmental impacts of \ninadequate water supplies in district or county towns, and lack of appropriate road infrastructure; (ii) \nreview CMG\u2019s town-level economic development strategies, priorities, and investment plans; (iii) \nidentify problems associated with inadequate access to water supplies and rural roads in the core \nsubprojects; (iv) review the likely resettlement impact of the core subprojects; (v) develop a project \nDMF; (vi) provide guidance to CMG\u2019s design institutes on FSR preparation; and (vii) prepare an \ninception report. During phase 2, lasting for 3 months, the TA will (i) assess the potential impacts of \n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n9  Stakeholder workshops were conducted in four representative towns during the fact-finding mission. \n \n ", "4 \nthe  proposed  components  based  on  technical,  institutional,  environmental,  social  and  ethnic, \neconomic, financial, and other factors; (ii) formulate balanced infrastructure development strategies \ncomprising structural and nonstructural measures; (iii) update FSRs components; (iv) assist CMG \nto prepare draft environmental impact assessments (EIAs), resettlement plans, social development \nplans,  ethnic  minority  development  plans,  and  an  ethnic  minority  development  framework \naccording to ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies, and conduct public consultations and disclosure of \nrelevant information; (v) develop technical, thematic, and safeguards assessment guidelines for \nevaluating subprojects during project implementation; (vi) refine the DMF through a stakeholder \nworkshop in each of the core subproject districts; and (vii) prepare an interim report. Phase 3, \nlasting 3 months, will assist CMG to (i) formulate an investment sector project for ADB funding; (ii) \nconsolidate FSRs prepared in phase 2; (iii) formulate procurement needs and arrangements; (iv) \njustify the subproject respective financial, economic, social, and environmental terms; (v) audit \noutputs of CMG design institutes\u2019 FSRs, and comment as appropriate on non-core components; (vi) \nprepare a best practice strategy for linking urban and rural development infrastructure in areas \nwhere there is a strong interrelated economy; (vii) prepare a draft final report; and (viii) issue the \nfinal report after receiving comments from ADB and CMG not more than 6 weeks after the issue of \nthe draft final report. An initial poverty and social analysis for Chongqing municipality is in Appendix \n2. \n \n12.  CMG has extensive experience with internationally-funded projects, including ADB-funded \nprojects. Some, but not all, of the implementing agencies in the subproject districts or counties \nhave experience of implementing such projects. In addition to providing guidance to CMG design \ninstitutes\u2019 on FSR preparation, the consultants will provide training during project preparation and \nin three one-day workshops conducted in both a northeast and a southeast district or county town. \nThe workshops will focus on (i) the DMF and a project performance management system, (ii) the \nEIA and environmental management planning, (iii) resettlement plans and social development, and \n(iv) procurement and loan disbursement procedures. The workshops will be held after the inception \nreports have been finalized. \n \n13.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA include (i) inadequate counterpart \nsupport and performance, (ii) lack of adequate and timely provision of necessary data, (iii) delay in \nsubmitting  required  studies,  (iv)  delay  in  appointing  and  mobilizing  consultants  and  design \ninstitutes, and (v) inadequate performance by the consultants and design institutes. To mitigate the \nrisks, the recruitment and performance of the consultants and design institutes will be monitored \nclosely by ADB. The Government has agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and all \nnecessary data according to an agreed-upon timetable. Close coordination among the consultants, \nexecuting and implementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,200,000 equivalent. It is proposed that \n$900,000 be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. CMG will provide the \nbalance of local costs, equivalent to $300,000, to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services \nincluding staff, office space, furniture, administrative support and interpretation services, logistics \nand local transportation (within district or county). ADB has informed the Government that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project or to extend any further TA with \nrespect to the implementation of any recommendations of the TA. The detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 3. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  CMG will be the Executing Agency for the TA. CMG has established a project leading \ngroup\u2014chaired by a vice mayor of Chongqing municipality and comprising representatives from \nthe  municipal  DRC,  Finance  Bureau,  Poverty  Reduction  Bureau,  Construction  Bureau,  Audit \nBureau, Communication and Transport Department, and Water Resources Bureau\u2014to provide \nguidance and support to the proposed project. Chongqing DRC will take the lead in maintaining \ninterdepartmental  coordination;  liaising  with  ADB  on  matters  relating  to  TA  implementation; \nfacilitating access to required data and surveys; and appointing sufficient, experienced professional \nstaff, including an interpreter/translator, who will work with the consultants on a full-time basis. \n \n16.  The proposed TA will be implemented over an 8-month period and is expected to start in \nFebruary  2009  and  be  completed  by  end  October  2009.  A  total  of  75.5  person-months  of \nconsulting  services  (21.5  international  and  54.0  national)  will  be  required.  The  international \nconsultants will provide expertise in urban\u2013rural infrastructure development, transport planning and \nmanagement, road engineering, water treatment and supply engineering, financial and economic \nanalyses,  resettlement  and  social  impact  analysis  (poverty,  gender  and  ethnic  minorities), \ninstitutional  capacity  development,  and  preparing  the  EIA.  The  national  consultants  will  have \nexpertise  in  rural  road  and  transport  engineering,  civil  and  geotechnical  engineering,  water \ntreatment and supply engineering, economic and financial analyses, environmental protection and \nmanagement, resettlement and social impact analysis, and institutional capacity development. The \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will select and engage consultants on the basis of the quality of the proposal (80%) and \nthe cost (20%) of the services to be provided (quality- and cost-based selection method) using \nsimplified technical proposal procedures. All reports by the consultants will be prepared in English \nand translated into Chinese. Tripartite meetings involving ADB staff, the consultants, and CMG will \nbe held in Chongqing city to provide guidance to the consultants and to review their reports. \n \n18.  Chongqing DRC will take the lead in providing a suitably furnished office with utilities and \ntelecommunication  access,  district  or  county-level  transport  (excluding  transport  between \nsubproject locations) for consultants, materials, maps, data and documents required by the TA; \nand will cover the cost of utilities for the use of the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and \nsupport staff. The consultants will procure TA equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will transfer the equipment to CMG upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Chongqing  Urban\u2013Rural \nInfrastructure Development Demonstration Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6        Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n \nImpact      Assumptions \nThe impact of the project  Increased urban\u2013rural  CMG Annual Report/  \u2022   Project design and \nis improved water supply  linkages and roads per  project reports  construction are \nfacilities and efficient  square kilometer in rural    implemented \nurban\u2013rural transport  areas by 2015.     effectively. \ninfrastructure in 14       \ndistricts/counties and 63  Increased paved-road  CMG Annual Report/  \u2022   Project financing \ntowns/villages that are  access from 75.4% to  project progress reports  requirements, \nlocated in the  95.0% within towns, and    including those \nmountainous northeast  from 54.2% to 60.0% in    from ADB, are \nand southeast regions of  villages by 2015.    provided on time.  \nChongqing.          \n  Improved water supply  Annual socioeconomic  \u2022   The Government \n  coverage in rural  surveys undertaken as  and ADB sign Loan \ncommunities by 2015.  part of the PPMS.  and project \n    agreements. \nImproved road access of  CMG records and   \npoor communities to  statistics  Risks \nmarkets and    \u2022  Costs are higher \nmanufacturing  District/county statistics;  than foreseen. \nemployment by 2015.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \nThe project will improve rural health by increasing access to safe potable water; and raise incomes by improving \nroad access to markets and employment. \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \n    2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:   \n \nThe project will assess its impact on beneficiaries, especially socioeconomic and health impacts, by identifying \npoverty-related baselines for project monitoring and evaluation. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project/program is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence?   \n \n         8 person-months of input by poverty/social development specialist are included in project design. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  During project design, poverty and social analysis to be conducted will provide \nthe pro-poor growth measures and governance on town levels.  \n \nDesign and monitoring framework workshops were held in community areas during technical assistance (TA) fact-\nfinding. Township and village participation in project design is required by terms of reference for PPTA consultants.  \nThe project is focused on assisting the poor. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.    Initial Social Analysis \n     Based on existing information: \n1. Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? \n \n    The roads subprojects will benefit about 760,000 people and the water supply subprojects will benefit about \n590,000 people. Of these totals, up to 21% of the rural beneficiaries are classified as poor, and up to 71% of the \npopulation in subproject counties are from ethnic minorities.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \n     Project beneficiaries are in need of safe, adequate, and reliable potable water supplies; easier access to towns to \nsell produce and goods and find employment.; easier access to social needs (schools, hospitals etc.); and improved \ndelivery of fuels and materials to remote settlements. \n \n3. What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \nPotential constraints include lack of effective formal and informal mechanisms to enable poor and marginalized \ngroups  to  access  proposed  benefits  and  services. The  project  will  include  assessment  of  social  risks  and \neffectiveness of governance institutions to formulate mitigation measures to address the constraints.
