In spite of the high per capita flows of development assistance into the Pacific region, \nlow economic growth has become typical of the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) over the past two decades. Factors influencing this \nsituation include the PDMCs\u2019 small populations and size, high vulnerability to external economic \nshocks, and geographic isolation, as well as the governance and security difficulties that some \nhave  experienced.  The  Pacific  region  includes  a  significant  number  of  weakly  performing \ncountries.1  \n \n2.  ADB recognizes that improving aid effectiveness is critical to improving development \nresults in the Pacific. ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy2 identifies the promotion of effective development \nprocesses as a strategic objective. In implementing this strategy, and reflecting its endorsement \nof the Paris Declaration,3 ADB is working closely with other external funding agencies to \nimprove  coordination  and  promote  harmonization.  It  is  also  strengthening  management  to \nproduce better results from its efforts to reduce poverty and promote development in the Pacific \nregion. In response to the particular challenges PDMCs pose for project implementation, ADB \nhas supported various mechanisms which promote closer liaison with member governments \nand development partners, and thereby enhance the impact and efficiency of ADB assistance.  \n \n3.  During high-level consultations in August 2007 in Sydney, Australia, ADB and the World \nBank decided that trialing the provision of greater resources in Samoa and Tonga to facilitate \nstrengthened coordination between ADB and the World Bank, with a focus on supporting the \ngovernments in implementing their national development strategies, would allow the institutions \nand these countries to engage more closely, thereby improving communication, interaction, and \nresults. The same discussions suggested that one of the weaker performing PDMCs\u2014Solomon \nIslands\u2014might benefit from a similar focus from ADB. ADB\u2019s discussions4 with representatives \nof the three national governments have resulted in an understanding on the impact, outcome, \nand outputs of the technical assistance (TA), as well as implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services.5 The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  ADB seeks to increase its responsiveness to the development needs of PDMCs by (i) \nfurther strengthening relations with the governments, the private sector, and nongovernment \norganizations in the region; (ii) improving the monitoring of ADB country activities; and (iii) \nimproving aid coordination. The combination of geographic isolation of the PDMCs and the \nrelatively small scale of ADB programs in these countries requires creative and innovative \napproaches to ensure that ADB\u2019s responsiveness to country needs is both appropriate and cost-\n                                                 \n1  ADB  identifies  weakly  performing  countries  as  (i)  those  ranking  in  the  fourth  or  fifth  quintiles  on  country \nperformance assessment ratings for 2 of the last 3 years, or (ii) those considered to be in conflict or recovering \nfrom conflict and thus fragile.  \n2  ADB. 2005. A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u20132009. Manila.  \n3  The Paris Declaration, endorsed on 2 March 2005, is an international agreement to which over 100 ministers, \nheads of agencies, and other senior officials adhered and committed their countries and organizations to continue \nto increase efforts in harmonization, alignment, and managing aid for results with a set of monitorable actions and \nindicators. \n4  Communications were initiated as follows: between the director general of the Pacific Department, the country \ndirector of the World Bank, and Samoa and Tonga, on 2 August 2007, with both countries expressing support for \nfield offices; between the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office and Solomon Islands, in September 2007, with \nthe Government of Solomon Islands being supportive; and with the World Bank, as detailed in the back-to-office \nreport on high-level consultations with AusAID and the World Bank, 30 August 2007, Annex 5.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2007.  \n ", "2   \neffective, and delivers results on the ground. Making targeted TA available in Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, and Tonga will be a deliberate step towards an even closer relationship with these \ncountries. The TA will support governments in their ability to manage for development results \nand enhance their access to, and utilization of, ADB assistance, and promote and support \nimplementation of an effective program.  \n \n5.  Support for improved coordination with development partners and closer interaction with \nthe country authorities will strengthen portfolio performance and policy dialogue. Mechanisms \nwill be employed to make this engagement cost-effective and efficient. Such mechanisms will \ninclude (i) close coordination and collaboration with the in-country World Bank and IFC liaison \nofficer during implementation of the TA in Samoa and Tonga; (ii) in Samoa and Tonga drawing \non the local pool of skilled persons to provide the required capacity to support governments in \ntheir  implementation  of  national  development  strategies  and  improve  aid  coordination;  (iii) \ngovernment provision of office space and associated utilities; and (iv) in all instances co-location \nwith the World Bank and IFC liaison officer. These mechanisms will allow ADB to give better \nservice to the selected PDMCs.  \n \n6.  This TA will support ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy objective of \u201cpromoting effective development \nprocesses\u201d, and the related strategic objective of the Pacific regional operations business plan6 \nof \u201cimproving outcomes in PDMCs \u2026 in managing for development results\u201d (footnote 2). The TA \nwill  directly  contribute  to  this  goal  by  enhancing  development  partner  coordination  and \nharmonization, and generating country participation in, and ownership of, the development \nprocess in line with the intent of the Paris Declaration for improving aid effectiveness (footnote \n3).  \n \n7.  Four  key  factors  were  used  to  identify  where  trialing  the  application  of  additional \nresources for aid coordination and support of government in their implementation of national \ndevelopment priorities will add the most value. These are (i) the size of current, and likely future, \nADB country portfolios (Appendix 2); (ii) the desired level of dialogue with government; (iii) the \npresence  of  characteristics  of  weakly  performing  countries;  and  (iv)  the  receptivity  of \ngovernments to such additional resources.  \n \n8.  Samoa has been widely considered one of the stronger performing economies among \nthe PDMCs, and is a regular borrower from ADB. The Samoa country operations business plan7 \nindicates that, for planning purposes, the 3-year Asian Development Fund (ADF) allocation for \n2007\u20132009 has been set at $61.46 million, and the indicative annual TA support for this period \nis about $900,000. As noted in the plan, ADB intends to make longer-term commitments to \nspecific sectors, supported by road maps for reform. The associated capacity strengthening and \ninstitution building will be better supported by additional resources which will allow for closer \ndialogue with the Government of Samoa.  \n \n9.  Tonga has exhibited characteristics of a weakly performing state. The Government of \nTonga has had to address (i) increasing demands for political reform, (ii) a major threat to \nmacroeconomic stability arising from large civil-service wage increases granted after a civil-\nservice strike in July\u2013September 2005, and (iii) growing community concerns over a range of \nsocial problems. Riots in November 2006, linked to the pro-democracy political struggle, inflicted \nsevere  economic  losses  on  the  country,  closed  private  businesses,  and  caused  extensive \ndamage to urban infrastructure in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. For planning purposes, the 3-year \nADF allocation for Tonga in 2007\u20132009 has been set at $15.33 million, and indicative annual TA \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Regional Operations Business Plan Pacific 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan Samoa 2007\u20132009. Manila. \n ", "  3\nsupport for the period will be around $900,000.8 Increased resources for development partner \nand country coordination will increase the capacity of the Government to implement its national \ndevelopment strategy and will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to operate successfully in Tonga.  \n \n10.  As  a  post-conflict  and  least-developed  country  with  relatively  weak  development \nperformance, Solomon Islands will benefit from additional resources devoted to strengthened \ndialogue and relationships with both development partners and the Government of Solomon \nIslands in support of implementation of the national development strategy. Given the importance \nto government of extensive partnerships supporting the implementation of national priorities, the \npromotion of closer coordination and collaboration with other development partners operating in \nthe  country  will  reinforce  the  effectiveness  of  the  state.  ADB  assistance  will  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to access information and advice on ADB products and processes, and \nwill support ADB\u2019s ongoing and planned country program.9 There is $8.58 million of ADF funds \navailable for investment in 2008 and, for planning purposes, the biennial allocation for 2009\u2013\n2010 has been set at $10 million. However, ADB will not provide new lending to Solomon \nIslands  until  the  debt  situation  further  stabilizes,  and  grants  will  depend  on  the  revised \nframework for ADF grants. ADB will provide TA support at an indicative average of $1.1 million \nper annum during 2008\u20132010.  \n \n11.  The World Bank is also creating in-country positions (liaison officers) in Samoa and \nTonga operating under somewhat similar terms of reference, though with the additional intent to \ndirectly support the World Bank Group operations in-country. Development partner coordination \nwill  clearly  be  enhanced  by  a  shared  commitment  to  the  national  development  strategy \ngenerated through these parallel positions, as will policy dialogue with governments. From the \ngovernment viewpoint, the coordination engendered between the multilateral banks will simplify \ntheir relationships with these organizations. Furthermore, the World Bank has recently opened a \nrepresentative office in Honiara, and this TA will seek to enhance ADB\u2019s coordination with this \noffice.  \n \n12.  This TA is likely to raise demand for a similar approach to supporting other PDMC \ngovernments  in  implementing  their  national  development  strategies  and  in  improving \ndevelopment partner coordination. While the three countries selected have greater needs in the \ncoming 3 years than other PDMCs, reviews forming an integral part of this TA will guide any \ndecision on its replication elsewhere in the Pacific region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be to generate economic growth through the sectors of ADB \nfocus in Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. The TA has three key outcomes: (i) enhanced \nrelationship between ADB and the participating governments, (ii) improved development partner \ncoordination, and (iii) improved ADB country portfolio performance. These outcomes will be \nassessed through midterm and final reviews of the TA performance and effectiveness.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will support the provision of additional resources and capacity for development \npartner coordination, and potentially harmonization, with a focus on facilitating government \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nimplementation of national development strategies\u2014in Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga\u2014\nfor 3 years.  \n \n15.  Outputs of the TA will comprise communication and coordination activities facilitated by \ncountry  focal  officers  supporting  implementation  of  national  strategies  and  promoting  aid \ncoordination. Each country focal officer will require (i) business premises (to be supplied by \ngovernments in Samoa and Tonga and shared with the World Bank in Solomon Islands); (ii) an \nadministrative assistant; (iii) office furniture, equipment, and supplies; and (iv) an agreed budget, \nwork program, and reporting arrangements. Midterm and final TA reviews of the effectiveness of \nthe country focal officers will also be outputs of the TA. These reviews will be completed 1.5 \nyears and 2.75 years after the country focal officers commence duties.  \n \n16.  The activities supported by the country focal officer will include (i) facilitating effective \ngovernment engagement with ADB, (ii) facilitating support to government in implementation of \nnational development strategies, and (iii) harmonization and aid coordination.  \n \n17.  An assumption is that suitably skilled persons will be found to fill the country focal officer \npositions. The selection of country focal officers will be a key in determining how much can be \nachieved in terms of support to the implementation of national development strategies and \nstrengthened aid coordination. The persons would need a good understanding of the country\u2019s \ndevelopment  situation,  institutional  arrangements,  and  operations.  To  manage  this  risk  by \nattracting high-quality candidates, the compensation for the country focal officer has been set at \na level equivalent to that of a deputy secretary of a government agency for the Samoa and \nTonga positions. In these countries, it is considered there is a sufficient pool of nationals to fill \nthe positions. In Solomon Islands, the pool of individuals is not considered broad enough to \nidentify a suitable candidate. Engaging a national consultant would, in addition, draw capacity \naway from an already capacity-restricted government. An international consultant with extensive \nsubregional or national experience will be sought for this position. Country focal officers will be \nexpected to have a sound understanding of ADB activities, policies, and procedures, and will be \nrequired to maintain up-to-date knowledge, including through participation in training activities \nas appropriate.  \n \n18.  The use of national consultants in implementing this TA raises the need to ensure their \nindependence. This risk needs to be mitigated to the extent possible so that efficient and \neffective services are delivered. This risk can be mitigated through appropriate selection of \ncandidates and judicious selection of the location for the country focal officers\u2019 work space. A \nfurther risk is the potential for lack of clarity in the reporting lines between the country focal \nofficer, the government, and ADB\u2019s South Pacific Subregional Office (SPSO) and Pacific Liaison \nand Coordination Office (PLCO). This risk has been minimized through the detailed terms of \nreference for country focal officers, including clear reporting responsibilities. To maximize the \neffectiveness of this TA, the World Bank and ADB will seek close consultation and coordination \nover work plan development for the country focal officers in Samoa and Tonga. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $1,580,000. The TA will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  in  the  amount  of  $1,500,000,  while  the \nGovernment of Samoa will provide $40,000 equivalent, and the Government of Tonga $40,000 \nequivalent through provision of office space. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 3. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  A no-objection letter will be sought and obtained from each of the three participating \nmember countries prior to implementation of the regional TA in each country. ADB will be the \nExecuting  Agency  for  this  TA.  Implementation  responsibilities  will  rest  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific \nOperations  Division.  Once  the  logistical  arrangements  required  to  support  the  enhanced \nengagement activities are in place, day-to-day communications and reporting will be through the \nPLCO in the case of Solomon Islands activities and through the SPSO for Samoa and Tonga \nactivities. The details of the reporting arrangements and responsibilities will be finalized during \nthe  inception  phase,  and  will  be  tailored  specifically  to  each  country.  The  support  for \ngovernment implementation of national development strategies will be undertaken in a manner \nconsistent with the priorities of each government.  \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a 3.5-year period, starting in September 2008 and \nending in March 2012. The TA will finance 39 person-months of international consulting services \nand 180 person-months of national consulting services. The proposed consultants will be (i) \ncountry  focal  officer,  Solomon  Islands  (international,  36  person-months);  (ii)  country  focal \nofficers, Samoa and Tonga (national, 72 person-months); (iii) administrative assistants, Samoa, \nSolomon  Islands,  and  Tonga  (national,  108  person-months);  and  (iv)  organizational  and \nperformance  evaluation  specialist  (international,  3  person-months,  intermittent).  ADB  will \nengage the consultants individually based on their qualifications, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n22.  The required equipment for the provision of technical assistance will be procured by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand will be handed over to the official contact point of the host government on TA completion. \nADB will facilitate access by the consultants to information systems, as feasible, to enhance the \noperational environment.  \n \n23.  Inception reports will be prepared by each of the country focal officers within 4 weeks of \nthe  start  of  field  activities.  The  inception  reports  will  include  a  work  program\u2014containing \nmilestones  and  performance  measures\u2014that  has  been  agreed  upon  with  the  appropriate \ncountry director and government. Quarterly performance reports will be provided to ADB and \nthe respective governments.10  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Enhancing Engagement with Pacific Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n10  Report formats will be determined in consultation between the government, country director, and country focal \nofficers.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms and Risks \nImpact  Assumptions \nEconomic growth generated  \u2022  Growth in economic  \u2022  National budget data  \u2022  No external shocks to the \nin Samoa, Solomon Islands,  sectors where ADB  from FY2009 through  economies. \nand Tonga through the  support is being  to FY2012  \u2022  Maintenance of law and \nsectors of ADB focus  provided  \u2022  Country partnership  order. \nstrategies \nOutcome  Assumptions \nEnhanced relationship  \u2022  Increased government  \u2022  Country partnership  \u2022  Country focal officers \nbetween ADB and  satisfaction with quality  strategies  maintain independence. \nparticipating governments   of relationships with    \u2022  Skilled country focal \n  ADB   \u2022  CPRMs  officers are recruited. \n  \u2022  Increased level of joint    \u2022  Workload is sufficient for \nImproved development  assessment,  \u2022  TA quarterly reports   country focal officers to \npartner coordination and  programming, and    stay fully engaged with \nharmonization  cofinancing in each  \u2022  Midterm and final TA  government and \n  country by end of 2009,  reviews  development partners. \n  particularly between  \u2022  Clear reporting lines \n  ADB and the World  between the country focal \n  Bank  officer and SPSO or \n  \u2022  Timely implementation  PLCO. \nImproved ADB country  of activities, reduction in   \nportfolio performance  projects rated at-risk,  Risks \n  and shortening of time  \u2022  Governments fail to utilize \nneeded to achieve  the resources on offer. \nproject effectiveness in  \u2022  Chosen country focal \nparticipating countries  officer is inappropriate or \n  ineffective due to lack of \nrequired skills. \n \nOutputs  Assumptions  \n1.
