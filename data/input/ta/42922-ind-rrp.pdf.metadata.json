As an honest broker, ADB provides \ndirect comfort to both the local and foreign investors through its \nproposed equity participation in the JVC. \n   \nUse of Proceeds  Alongside those from other investors and debt, the proceeds of \nADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  used  to  fund  the  development  and \nconstruction  of  the  renewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as  the \nincorporation and start-up expenses of the JVC.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  outcome  of  the  investment  will  be  500  MW  of \nadditional renewable-power generation by 2012 by implementing \nprojects  through  public-private  partnership,  thus  catalyzing \ninvestment  from  the  private  sector.  The  investment  will  help \ndiversify India's energy mix away from its dependence on fossil \nfuels, notably coal-fired thermal projects, toward more sustainable \nenergy sources, and contribute to the national goal of achieving \nand maintaining 10% of total power generation from renewable \nsources by 2012. \n   \n ", "ii   \nEnvironment and Social  As an equity investment, this will be classified as environmental \nAssessment  category FI. Given the nature and general location of projects to \nbe financed by the JVC, the investment has been classified as \nB/C under the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and B \nfrom the perspective of the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998).  The  JVC  will  implement  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies,  and  will  screen,  assess,  and  monitor  projects  at  the \nappropriate stage of due diligence. The JVC will covenant not to \nfinance activities on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. \n   \nDevelopment Impact   The investment will achieve the following: \n(i)  Accelerate the development and financing of renewable \nenergy  projects  in  India  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions,  such  as  carbon  dioxide,  in  line  with  the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n(ii)  Help reduce India\u2019s dependence on fossil fuel sources to \nmeet  the  growing  power  demand  and  use  indigenous \nrenewable  sources  to  meet  and  maintain  the  policy \nobjective  of  generating  10%  of  its  power  needs  from \nrenewable sources by 2012. \n(iii)  Catalyze foreign investment in the renewable-power sector \nin India by facilitating the formation of a new independent \nutility  company  in  a  joint  venture  between  experienced \nglobal  electric  utility  companies  and  NTPC  Limited,  the \nanchor  of  India\u2019s  power  sector.  As  indicated  by  both \nforeign investors, ADB\u2019s equity participation is a key factor \nin their decision to invest in the JVC. \n \n   \nJustification  The investment aligns with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework \n2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) and Clean Energy and Environment \nProgram, which calls for ADB investments in energy efficiency \nand renewable energy in Asia to reach about $1 billion a year and \nto sustain that level. It helps India diversify from fossil fuels for \npower generation and benefit from underused indigenous sources \nof energy. The proposed JVC, initiated by ADB, introduces the \nindependent utility model for renewables, which will help bring \ndown the overall cost of funding (and hence the average cost of \ngeneration) and attract other foreign investors to the renewable \nsector. \n \n \n \n ", "1    \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity  investment  of  up  to  $40,000,000  equivalent  in  a  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  for \nRenewable Energy Development in India. \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  India is endowed with abundant renewable energy sources\u2014solar, wind, biomass, and \nsmall hydroelectric\u2014and the Government is working proactively to develop them to reduce \nlong-standing peak power and energy deficits sustainably. Under the \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d \ninitiative, the Government looks forward to universal electricity supply in India by 2012. The \nmagnitude of the investment is vast: 78,700 MW of additional power generation capacity is \nneeded to reach that goal. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) (formerly the \nMinistry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources) has proposed exploiting the full potential of \nrenewable energy sources to increase generation capacity in the country. The National Electric \nPolicy, issued by the Ministry of Power in February 2005, also emphasized the development of \nrenewable energy sources, and the Integrated Energy Policy of August 2006 provided the vision \nneeded to reliably meet the demand for energy in a technically efficient, economically viable, \nand environmentally sustainable manner.  \n \n3.  Since its inception, India\u2019s renewable energy program has been driven by policies and \npromotional measures framed initially by MNRE and subsequently by the state governments. \nThe promotional measures available to renewable energy projects comprise a wide range of \nfiscal  and  financial  incentives,  including  concessional  loans,  concessional  customs  duties, \nexemptions from excise duties, income tax holidays, and accelerated depreciation benefits. \nThese policies have led to the development by January 2009 of 13,000 MW of renewable \nenergy, 9% of total power generation in the country. To accelerate the promotion of renewable \nenergy, most state electric regulatory commissions (SERCs) have imposed minimum amounts \nof  renewable  energy  purchase  obligations  on  licensed  distributors  in  their  states.  The \nrequirements are aligned with achieving the national renewable energy target of 10% of total \npower  generation  capacity\u201422,000  MW  of  renewable  energy\u2014by  2012,  according  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FYP).1 \n \n4.  NTPC Limited (established in 1975 as the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited) \noperates over 29,000 MW in thermal-power generating capacity in India and, with a 28% market \nshare, is the industry anchor. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing relationship \nwith NTPC through a nonsovereign loan facility signed in September 20062 to partially finance \ntwo  supercritical  thermal  power  plants  in  India.  ADB  has  encouraged  NTPC  to  continue \ndiversifying its sources of power generation and improving the environmental aspects of future \nprojects. NTPC has set a corporate goal of adding 1,000 MW of capacity through renewable \nenergy sources.  \n \n5.  ADB and NTPC have also discussed the establishment of a new joint venture company \n(JVC), with private sector entities as majority owners, to develop renewable power sources on a \nlarger  scale  as  a  power  utility  would,  instead  of  project  by  project.

The JVC would also include the energy \nfinancial  services  group  of  General  Electric  Energy  of  the  United  States  (GE Energy)  and \nKyushu Electric Power Company of Japan (Kyushu), private sector power companies whose \nglobal expertise in renewable energy would be invaluable to the venture. The proposed equity \ninvestment received concept clearance in January 2008, and due diligence was completed in \nFebruary 2009. If approved, the investment would be ADB\u2019s first in a public-private partnership \nto develop, construct, and operate renewable energy projects in India. \nIII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Background, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n1.  Demand for and Supply of Power \n6.  India is the third-largest electricity consumer in Asia behind the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  and  Japan.  As  of  31  January  2009,  its  installed  power  generation  capacity  was \n147,452 MW, of which 56% was owned and operated by state entities, 33% by central public \nsector undertakings, and 11% by independent power producers and other private sector utilities. \nThermal  power  plants,  mostly  coal-fired,  provide  63%  of  installed  capacity.  Hydropower \naccounts for 25% of the capacity, and renewable energy plants and nuclear plants, for the \nremaining 12%.3 Industry buys about 35% of the electricity sold in India, followed by households \nat 25%, agriculture at 22%, and businesses and others at 18%.4 Annual consumption per capita \nis relatively low, at slightly over 700 kilowatt-hours (kWh), despite the growing economy. In \naddition, power quality remains poor, marked by high voltage fluctuations and recurring load \nshedding.  India  continues  to  suffer  from  chronic  electricity  shortages,  with  peak  demand \nexceeding supply by 13.8% and the energy deficit at 11.0% as of January 2009 (footnote 3). \n \n7.  Power demand in India has grown rapidly as the economy has expanded, at an annual \naverage rate of 6.8% in real terms since FY1995.5 As the 10th FYP (2002\u20132007) achieved only \n52% of the targeted increase in capacity, energy shortfalls will persist at least over the short to \nmedium term. Target capacity has been expanded to 78,700 MW for the 11th FYP period \n(2007\u20132012), to keep the longer-term economic growth target within reach. This excludes the \n11th FYP target for renewable energy generation capacity proposed by MNRE of 15,000 MW, \nincluding 14,000 MW of grid-interactive renewable power and 1,000 MW of off-grid renewable \npower.  If  these  ambitious  goals  are  attained, India  should  be  able  to  achieve  its  national \nelectricity policy goal of Power for All by 2012 and available power per capita should reach \n1,000 kWh by FY2012. \n \n8.  The availability of electric power, and more broadly infrastructure, has indirect but strong \nlinks to poverty reduction and economic growth. In 2008, India\u2019s finance minister suggested that \nthe country\u2019s lack of adequate infrastructure was holding back its economic growth by 1.5%\u20132% \nper year.6 Empirical evidence presented by other comprehensive studies on the links between \nnew electricity availability and economic growth suggest that increases in per capita gross \n                                                 \n3  Central Electricity Authority. 2009.

Energy Mix and Environmental Impact in India \n9.  The burning of fossil fuels accounts for 66% of the total energy production in India and is \nresponsible for a majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the 11th FYP period, \nutility-based generation is set to increase by 78,000 MW, with coal-fired thermal power making \nup the majority. Table 1 shows the energy mix for electricity generation in India as of the end of \n2007 and the estimated generation of GHG emissions per unit of electricity. \n \nTable 1: Energy Mix and Emission Intensity for Electricity Generation in India, 2007 \n \nProportion  Weighted Average GHG Emissionsa \nFuel Source  (%)  (tons CO  per MWh) \n2\nCoal  53  1.08 \nHydropower  25  \u2013   \nOil / Diesel / Naphtha  1  0.62 \nNatural gas  10  0.47 \nWind and solar power  8  \u2013   \nNuclear power  3  \u2013   \nCO  = carbon dioxide, GHG = greenhouse gas, MWh = megawatt-hour. \n2\na  Values denoted by a hyphen are negligible or not measurable. \nSource: Central Electricity Authority. 2008.

While total emissions from the power sector have been increasing in the past 3 years \n(from 469 million tons of carbon dioxide [CO ] in 2006 to 520 million tons of CO  in 2008), the \n2 2\nweighted average operating emissions intensity rate (tons per CO per megawatt-hour) has \n2 \nbeen declining slightly (from 0.82 to 0.80).8 \n \n11.  In 2008, the Office of the Prime Minister issued the National Action Plan on Climate \nChange to raise the living standards of the majority of Indians and at the same time reduce their \nvulnerability to the impact of climate change. The action plan is guided by the principles of \nprotecting the poor through inclusive and sustainable development, deploying technologies for \nthe mitigation of GHG emissions, and engineering new and innovative market, regulatory, and \nvoluntary mechanisms to promote sustainable development on an equitable basis.9 \n \n12.  The action plan comprises eight national missions defining multipronged, long-term, \nintegrated strategies for achieving climate-change objectives. These eight missions include, \namong other items, sustainable agriculture, enhanced energy efficiency, use of solar energy, \nand the \u201cgreening\u201d of India. India\u2019s development agenda defined in the 11th FYP targets poverty \neradication as a prerequisite for economic growth. As of 2005, 27.5% of the population lived in \npoverty and 44% had no access to power. India\u2019s goal of increasing access to power for all its \ncitizens is based in part on the strong positive correlation between energy use and human \ndevelopment.10 \n                                                 \n7   Esfahani,  H.

As its power demand has escalated, India has depended more and more on fossil fuels. \nWith oil and gas prices so volatile, global production declining, and fossil fuels expected to be in \nshort  supply  in  the  future,  energy  security  has  become  an  increasing  concern  for  India. \nEnvironmental concerns over excessive use and dependence on fossil fuels are also on the \nrise. India is therefore urgently exploring sustainable energy development, while reducing GHG \nintensity.  Two  major  areas  of  renewable  energy  development,  in  view  of  their  natural \nabundance, are wind power and small hydropower. \na.  Wind Power in India \n14.  Among the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy is a promising \nsource for further development. India has over 45,000 MW of gross potential and 13,000 MW of \ntechnical potential for wind power. A 2,200 MW increase in installed wind power capacity was \ntargeted in the 10th FYP, but over 5,400 MW was actually installed.11 As of September 2007, \nIndia, with over 7,700 MW of installed wind power capacity, ranked fourth in the world after \nGermany, the United States, and Spain.  \n \n15.  The  Government  has  provided  support  measures  to  increase  renewable  energy \ncontributions in the country. It has also issued policy guidelines for the state governments to \nestablish  and  maintain  state-specific  policies  to  promote  renewable  power  projects.  These \npolicies  include  permission  to  accelerate  depreciation,  concession  or  full  exemption  from \ncustoms duties, tax holidays, and soft loans available through government-owned agencies. \nOther policy and financial incentives are now being implemented by MNRE.  \n \n16.  The wind power sector in India has been dominated by indigenous wind-turbine original \nequipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as Suzlon Energy, Enercon (India), RRB Energy, and \nVestas Wind Technology, which collected wind resource data early on and obtained land-use \nrights for potential sites. These manufacturers-cum-developers can fully develop and operate \ncommercial wind farms on their own behalf, sell the development rights to other developers \nthrough engineering, procurement, and construction contracts, or carve out portions of the \nplanned wind farms for other investors. In all cases, project concessions require validation of \nwind resource data by the Center for Wind Energy Technology. While this process has led to an \ninitial rise in wind power installations, it has also hindered the development of potential sites as \nreturns to other investors are limited by the prices offered by the OEMs. Appendix 2 contains \nmore information on the wind-power sector in India. \nb.  State Regulatory Environment for Wind Power  \n17.  The SERCs control the approval of wind power projects for grid connectivity and the sale \nof  electricity  to  the  utilities.  Most  of  the  SERCs  in  states  with  high  wind  potential  have \nstandardized long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and declared feed-in tariffs as \nprovided in the Electricity Act 2003 and the National Electricity Tariff Policy. These states \ninclude Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya  Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Offtake of \npower from wind and renewables is guaranteed via \u201cmust-run status\u201d priority in the merit-order \ndispatch of total electricity from all utilities in each state. \n \n                                                 \n11  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  2007.  Annual Report 2006\u20132007.  New Delhi. ", "    5 \n18.  A first-year accelerated-depreciation incentive at 80% is also offered; however, in light of \nthe typically low profitability during the first year of operation, this incentive, in some cases, \nprovides only a limited tax shield. Many developers of early wind projects were in fact investors \nin more diversified businesses not related to energy, so that the depreciation benefits and tax \nshield could be applied to consolidated profits. This process led to inefficient operation or \nmaintenance  of  wind  turbines,  reducing  availability  and  utilization.  In  response  to  this \nunintended  consequence,  MNRE  in  2008  announced  a  generation-based  incentive  as  an \nalternative to accelerated depreciation. The incentive is Rs0.50 per kWh paid on top of the \nfeed-in tariffs set by SERCs for a period of 10 years after the commercial operation date. \nMNRE\u2019s initial target of 49 MW to qualify for the incentive is likely to increase to 5,000 MW by \n2012. \nc.  Small Hydroelectric Power in India \n19.  The  Central  Electric  Authority  has  estimated  India\u2019s  hydropower  potential  at \n148,700 MW, with 28,000 MW in operation and 14,000 MW in various stages of development.12 \nThe potential installed capacity of small hydropower13 is estimated at 15,000 MW; only about \n2,000 MW is in operation. Hydropower generation is often the only means of providing electricity \nto low-income populations in remote hilly areas with limited access to grid connection. Small \nhydropower is also more predictable than solar or wind power: variations in water flow occur \nover longer periods, rather than hourly or daily. \n \n20.  MNRE oversees the development of small hydropower and has set a target of facilitating \nthe development of about 2,000 MW through 2012. The focus of the small-hydropower program \nis commercialization through private sector participation with physical and financial incentives.14 \nMNRE  is  providing  the  states  with  financial  support  for  project  development\u2014for  the \nidentification of new potential sites, the conduct of detailed surveys, and the preparation of \ndetailed project reports\u2014and implementation incentives consisting of interest subsidies ranging \nfrom  1.50%  to  5.00%  for  commercially  developed  1\u201325  MW  projects.  The  South  Asia \nDepartment of ADB has also been working with state governments on the development of \nhydropower projects in the states of Uttarakhand15 and Himachal Pradesh.16 Further details on \nthe small hydroelectric power market in India can be found in Appendix 3. \n4.  Constraints on Private Sector Participation \n21.  Despite the programs put in place by central and state agencies, foreign investment in \nthe Indian renewable power sector remains limited. The sector continues to be dominated by \nwind-turbine OEMs, local investors, and existing power utilities, which seek to maximize the \naccelerated-depreciation  benefits  (or  must  now  meet  state-mandated  renewable  power \npurchase obligations). Participation tends to be project by project and without a coordinated \nstrategic approach to meeting the Government\u2019s renewable energy standards efficiently. \n \n                                                 \n12 Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change.  2008.

The MNRE has established tax and generation incentives to encourage private sector \nparticipation in wind power, but significant barriers tend to put off some private sector investors. \nThese barriers include (i) the absence of comparable economies of scale in renewable projects, \n(ii) marginal commercial viability, (iii) the inability to sustain regulatory incentives, and (iv) the \ncollection  and  credit  risk  assumed  by  state  offtakers  who  cannot  negotiate  additional \npayment-security or hypothecation provisions. Due diligence to determine the technical merits of \nprojects,  verify  land  ownership  and  approvals,  and  negotiate  offtake  contracts  and  power \nevacuation can also be cumbersome to less-experienced investors without access to local \nexpertise. \n  \n23.  Small hydropower developers with no experience in managing the development process, \nor those with limited access to capital required to complete the detailed studies, have difficulty \novercoming the technical, procedural, and cost barriers. Typically, developers must obtain a \nproject allotment from the state nodal agency, clearance from the Ministry of Environment and \nForests (MoEF) if forest land is involved, and clearances from the irrigation, water resources, \nand  state  land-use  departments  to  have  their  projects  approved.  In  the  absence  of  a \nstreamlined, single-window clearance system, the process of obtaining approvals can set back \norganizations unfamiliar with the process. While local banks and financial institutions may be \nwilling to lend long term to such projects, the development and time-sensitive construction risks \nusually necessitate recourse to financial resources from outside the project, such as a corporate \nguarantee. Hence, private investment in small hydropower projects have ironically been limited \nto the larger infrastructure and power project developers. In both the wind power and small \nhydropower subsectors, the JVC will implement a new business model that will leverage the \npartners\u2019  financial  strength,  technical  expertise,  and  industry  relationships  (in  India  and \nworldwide) to pursue such projects on a much larger scale as an independent electric utility \ncompany focused solely on the renewable business.  \nB.  ADB Operations, Strategy, and Sector Policy \n1.  Country Strategy \n24.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy for India.17 The 2009\u20132012 country partnership strategy is now in the advanced stages \nof development. The 2006\u20132008 country strategy and program (CSP) update draws on the \nthree pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor growth, social development, and \ngood governance. The strategy is aimed at supporting the achievement of the Government\u2019s \nhigh-growth agenda by assisting in fiscal consolidation, infrastructure development, and private \nsector development. Political and economic developments since the last approved CSP was \nfinalized indicate that the assistance strategy remains valid, especially the core strategy of \npoverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth supported by social development and good \ngovernance. The CSP update suggests that, for GDP growth to accelerate to 8% as planned, \ninfrastructure facilities must be upgraded and public services must be made more efficient. \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance program reflects this priority: infrastructure accounts for nearly 77% \nof the 3-year pipeline (not including private sector and other nonsovereign operations).  \n                                                 \n17  ADB.

ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n25.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the energy sector18 establishes its operational priorities as (i) reducing \npoverty  by,  among  others,  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth; \n(ii) promoting private sector involvement by restructuring the energy sector and creating an \nenabling environment for private investors; (iii) addressing the environmental impact on the \nregion and the rest of the world; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the \nstrategy strongly encourages ADB interventions to increase investment in the renewable energy \nsubsector, as  well  as to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take \nadvantage of the higher operational efficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet \nthe large capital requirements. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s assistance to the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has \nsix main priorities: (i) reforming the sector; (ii) promoting higher-efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources that are locally available; (iii) expanding and optimizing transmission and distribution \nsystems; (iv) supporting institutional strengthening to implement the reforms required under the \nElectricity Act of 2003, including the development of more flexible power delivery and trading \nsystems; (v) promoting private sector participation; and (vi) encouraging energy conservation, \nand ensuring environmental and social sustainability. To support the Government\u2019s Power for \nAll by 2012 initiative, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector will create synergy with the 11th FYP \nthrough the development of sustainable energy sources, particularly the promotion of renewable \nenergy projects, and other means. \n  3.  Strategy 2020 \n27.  A  core  area  of  operation  under  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020) is environmentally-sustainable growth for the region.19 One of the key actions is \nmitigating  climate  change.  ADB  will  assist  the  developing  member  countries  in  moving  to \nlow-carbon growth paths by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) expanding the use of clean \nenergy  sources,  (iii) reducing  fugitive  GHG  emissions,  (iv)  modernizing  public  transport \nsystems, and (v) arresting deforestation. \n \n28.  The ADB 2009 Energy Policy20 emphasizes, among other objectives, the development of \nindigenous energy sources and the creation of markets conducive to foreign investment in \ndeveloping member countries. The 2009 policy updates the 1995 policy and its 2000 review, \nand aligns ADB\u2019s energy initiatives with Strategy 2020. One of the principles of the policy\u2019s \nimplementation  is  the  promotion  of  clean  energy  projects  and  the  provision  of  energy  to \ncommunities and groups with no access to its economic and social benefits. As part of the \npolicy  implementation,  ADB  is  emphasizing  public-private  partnerships  to  enhance  energy \nsector efficiency by increasing competition and investable resources. The objective is to create \na framework that makes investing in renewable energy a commercially viable proposition. ADB \nis committed to facilitating direct private sector participation.  \n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2000.

THE PROPOSED JOINT-VENTURE COMPANY \nA.  Company Mission and Objectives \n29.  Investments in the renewable energy sector involve more risks than investments in \nconventional energy sources because of (i) the relatively higher cost per unit; (ii) the uncertainty \nof equipment life and long-term maintenance resources; (iii) technical issues such as voltage \ncontrol and loss optimization in remotely connected generation; (iv) commercial issues, since \nrenewable energy is not a substitute for firm capacity; and (v) the long gestation and breakeven \nperiod for investments. ADB\u2019s participation is needed, given the heightened risk perceptions and \nwithdrawal  of  investors  and  lenders  in  the  global  liquidity  and  credit  crisis.  Thus,  for  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  renewable  energy  projects,  investors  must  not  only  have \ntechnical,  project  management,  and  procurement  abilities  but  must  also  be  skilled  in  the \ncommercial aspects and in long-term financing and risk taking. A combination of financially \nstrong electric power utilities, experienced renewable energy investors, and financial institutions \nthat can provide long-term financing would be best equipped to succeed at this task. \n \n30.  NTPC, ADB, Kyushu, and GE Energy propose to combine their aligned objectives and \nmanagement capabilities in a public\u2013private JVC that will develop, construct, operate, and \nmaintain renewable energy projects with maximum development impact on the people of India. \nSuccess in achieving India\u2019s renewable energy target of 10% of total power generation depends \nin large part on private sector participation in the selection, development, and implementation of \nprojects in a timely and cost-effective manner. However, the present model, where private \nsector investors develop one project at a time, is not the most efficient path to renewable energy \ngeneration. Developing renewable projects in a portfolio allows the blending of credit, offtake, \ndevelopment, and technical risks, and potentially lowers the overall cost of financing. The JVC \nwill endeavor to invest in a portfolio of 500 MW of renewable energy generation projects in India \nover a period of 3 years.  \n \n31.  To start with, the JVC will concentrate on wind power and small hydroelectric power \nprojects  in  India.  But  other  renewable  power  generation  resources,  such  as  industrial \ncogeneration, waste-to-energy, solar, geothermal, biomass, biofuel, and tidal energy projects, \nmay also be considered. In the future, the JVC could adopt a regional and global outlook as a \nmajor investor in, and facilitator of, renewable energy. \nB.  Organization and Management \n1.  Shareholders \n32.  The JVC will be established as a partnership between public and private shareholders. \nAt  incorporation,  the  largest  shareholding  (40%)  will  be  held  by  NTPC,  a  state-owned \nenterprise. The rest of the shares will be held equally by ADB and two global power companies, \nKyushu (Japan) and GE Energy (United States). The foreign partners were selected jointly by \nADB and NTPC in a structured expression-of-interest process on the basis of their financial \nstrength, global experience in carrying out renewable energy projects, and long-term interest in \ninvesting in the Indian power sector. At no point will the Government of India hold, directly or \nindirectly, more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares. More information about the \nshareholders is in Appendix 4. \n ", "    9 \n33.  NTPC, 89% of which is owned by the Government, is the premier power generation \ncompany in India, with expertise and strength in such areas as establishing, operating, and \nmaintaining large power projects, and selling power to various state power utilities and other \nbulk customers. It operates over 29,000 MW of power generation capacity. According to its \naudited statements for FY2008, NTPC has a turnover of Rs400.2 billion net profit after tax of \nRs75.1 billon and net worth of Rs526 billion. It is rated BBB\u2212 by Standard & Poor\u2019s but was \nrecently placed on negative watch because of the deterioration of the sovereign\u2019s fiscal position. \nNTPC has developed comprehensive in-house expertise in various facets of power generation, \nfrom  concept  to  commissioning,  efficient  operation,  and  nurturing  of  ecology  and  the \nenvironment in accordance with the policies of the Government. Its corporate plan foresees \nabout 1,000 MW in additional capacity up to 2017 from renewable energy sources.  \n \n34.  Kyushu,  the  fourth-largest  electric  power  company  in  Japan,  operates  193  power \ngeneration facilities with a total capacity of 19,716 MW on Kyushu and surrounding islands. \nWhile  a  majority  of  this  capacity  is  thermal  and  nuclear  power,  the  company  also  has \n138 hydroelectric power stations (2,676 MW), five geothermal power stations (207 MW), and \ntwo wind power stations (3.3 MW) in its renewable energy portfolio. Its overseas investments in \nAsia include the 1,200 MW Ilijan gas-fired power project in the Philippines and the 717 MW \nPhu My 3 gas-fired power project in Viet Nam, which was partially financed by ADB. In FY2008, \nKyushu had a turnover of $14.8 billion, net profit after tax of $416.4 million, and net worth of \n$23.0 billion. That year, Kyushu began voluntarily reducing its CO  emissions, with the aim of \n2\nachieving a 20% reduction in the 1990 levels by 2012. It plans to add substantial wind, biomass, \nand solar projects by 2017. \n \n35.  A business unit of General Electric (GE), GE Energy Financial Services provides long-\nterm debt, mezzanine, and equity finance to the energy and water sectors around the world and \nhas over $14 billion in assets, backed by GE's technical knowledge and financial strength. GE is \nrated AA+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s. It invests more than $5 billion each year in energy and water, \ntwo of the world\u2019s most capital-intensive industries. It adds more than 25 years of lending and \ninvesting experience in these industries to GE's 100 years in the energy business. GE Energy \nFinancial Services' renewable energy portfolio of over $4 billion includes wind, biomass, biogas, \nsolar, geothermal, and small hydro projects. The company currently owns equity interest in 51 \nwind  farms  worldwide,  with  the  capacity  to  produce  more  than  2,550  MW  of  renewable \nelectricity. Through its affiliated companies, GE Energy brings technical knowledge from its \nmanufacturing of high-capacity wind-turbine generators and off-grid distributed-generation sets \nand experience operating and maintaining its renewable energy equipment worldwide. \n2.  Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer \n36.  The shareholders will appoint 5\u201315 nominees to the board of directors of the JVC in a \ncomposition approximately proportional to the shareholding of each investor. Initially, there will \nbe a maximum of five directors, two of whom will be nominated by NTPC and one each by ADB, \nKyushu, and GE Energy. If ADB decides not to nominate a director, it will have the right to \nappoint an observer to the board. For the first 10 years after formation of the JVC and subject to \nthe unanimous consent of the parties, the board will be chaired by a director nominated by \nNTPC, who will preside over the meetings of the board and the shareholders.  \n \n37.  The JVC will form its own professional management team under a chief executive officer \n(CEO)  and  supported  by  executives  in  engineering,  finance,  human  resources,  and  utility \noperations. The CEO will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the JVC. The initial \n ", "10  \nactivities will include proposing the organization structure of the JVC, delegating authority to \nvarious  officials,  creating  initial  staff  positions,  having  budgets  approved  by  the  board  of \ndirectors, and recruiting and managing the employees. The CEO will also be responsible for \nfinalizing and updating the business plan of the company.  \nV.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \nA.  Development Impact and Outcome \n50.  The JVC will help diversify India\u2019s energy mix and wean the country away from its \ndependence on fossil fuels, notably coal-fired thermal projects, and toward more sustainable \nenergy sources. In the process, 1.1 million tons per year of CO  emissions will be avoided,21 \n2\nand the national goal of generating 10% of the country\u2019s power needs from renewable sources \nby 2012 will become more attainable. \n \n51.  The JVC intends to commission 500 MW of additional renewable power generation by \n201222 by implementing projects through public-private partnership, thus catalyzing investment \nfrom the private sector and delivering maximum value to the public sector. The additional \ncapacity would provide about 1.2 gigawatt-hours of additional electricity per year, helping to \nbridge the persistent energy deficits and load shedding, which disproportionally affect India\u2019s \npoor with limited or no access to electricity.  \nB.  Development Effectiveness \n52.  The development impact of the investment in the JVC will be assessed in terms of \nprivate sector development, business success, and economic sustainability according to the \nguidelines  for  implementing  the  Good-Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector \nInvestment Operations.23 The JVC will incubate projects in a diversified portfolio that can attract \nprivate sector investment at the time of listing or sale and by introducing the independent utility \nmodel of collaboration between a state-owned utility and strategic foreign electric utilities. With a \ntarget of continuously developing private renewable energy generation, even beyond 500 MW, \nthe JVC will demonstrate a model of renewable portfolio development for future private sector \ninvestments in alternative energy. Over the past 18 months, ADB has facilitated discussions and \nnegotiations between the state-owned enterprise and foreign investors to reconcile the different \nrisk perceptions and investment expectations. The success of the JVC may encourage further \npartnerships between the public sector and strategic foreign investors. The market assessment \nindicates that the portfolio of projects is financially and economically sustainable and will play a \nsignificant role in mitigating GHG emissions, thus leading to global environmental benefits. The \nJVC\u2019s development effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Considerations \n53.  The initial JVC investment is classified as environmental category FI (equity investment) \nbecause the specific subprojects have not yet fully been identified. An environmental and social \n                                                 \n21 Assuming 500 MW of renewable capacity in operation. \n22 At a conservative average plant load factor of 25%, typical for wind-power projects. \n23  Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group.  2006.  Good-Practice Standards for Evaluation of \nPrivate Sector Investment Operations. Washington D.C. 3rd ed. ", "    11 \nmanagement system will be put in place by the JVC after incorporation. For those projects \nenvisioned by the JVC, the subprojects are likely to be classified as environmental category B \nbecause renewable energy projects are unlikely to create any significant negative environmental \nimpact during construction and operation. The JVC will covenant not to finance activities that \nare on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investment activities. As laid out in the environmental and social \nmanagement  system  framework  (Appendix  6),  each  project  will  be  properly  classified  and \nassessed in line with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies before subprojects are approved \nby ADB. \n  \n54.  The perceptible environmental impact of wind power projects is noise and visual impact, \nbut both may be considered insignificant depending on the setback of turbines from settlements \nand the landscape values of the sites. Bird kill may be a nonissue since locations in the flight \npaths of endangered migratory birds will be avoided. Small hydroelectric projects could result in \nchanges in waterway ecosystems, in the migration of some aquatic species, and in terrestrial \nareas affected by inundation where small amounts of pondage may be required. The JVC will \ntherefore prioritize the development of run-of-the-river configurations that require minimal or no \npondage  to  maintain  flooding  of  the  penstock,  and  will  avoid  locating  in  environmentally \nsensitive areas such as national parks or wildlife reserves.  Any environmental disturbance \nassociated  with  construction  (i.e.,  land  disturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation) is considered temporary, by \nvirtue of the limited extent and significance of the consequences. The implementation of the \nenvironmental management plan for each project will minimize or mitigate the impact during \nproject operations, and will also include monitoring arrangements. \n \n55.  The  project  sites  may  be  on  government  or  private  land  or  forestland.  Sites  on \ngovernment-owned land or forestland could first be leased by the Government to the JVC or \ndeveloper, and then transferred to the utility on commissioning. For privately owned land, the \nland is likely to be purchased by the JVC or the developer and later transferred to the utility after \nlegal  due  diligence  by  the  utility.  The  physical  assets  of  wind  farms  have  relatively  small \nfootprints. Wind-turbine generators will be sited on uninhabited land to avoid displacement of \ncommunities or loss of livelihoods. It is anticipated that the amount of land to be permanently \nacquired or purchased will be limited, and effects on grazing or agricultural activities, if not \navoided, will be only minimal or temporary. Wind power projects are likely to be developed in \nstates where there are tribal populations (Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and \nRajasthan), but the impact on scheduled tribes is expected to be limited since only small parcels \nof land will be required and tribal community life as a whole is unlikely to be disrupted. Given the \nnature and general location of projects to be financed by the JVC, the investment has been \nclassified  as  B/C  under  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  B  from  the \nperspective of the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 7. \nD.  Economic Evaluation \n59.  The  economic  analysis  conducted  to  measure  the  viability  of  the  JVC  from  the \nperspective of India\u2019s economy (Appendix 9) shows all costs and benefits in domestic 2009 \nconstant  values,  with  all  estimated  taxes  and  duties  excluded.  The  value  of  electricity \ngenerated, the major economic benefit from the implementation of the JVC business plan, will \nbe fully absorbed at present levels of electricity demand in the identified states, all of which face \npower shortages. The energy and power shortages of the past decade were mainly due to the \nsignificant  lag  in  capacity  additions  behind  demand  growth.  Hence,  the  electricity  to  be \n ", "12  \ngenerated by the JVC will answer unmet demand, i.e., it will not be a substitute for power from \nexisting  generation  capacity.  The  entire  output  from  the  JVC  will  be  incremental  and  will \nincrease the supply of clean energy. Although the projects are not registered for CERs, the \ninvestments will lead to reductions in GHG emissions, a global environmental benefit. The \neconomic  analysis  incorporates  the  value  of  this  benefit,  using  a  reasonable  international \nmarket price for CERs.  \n \n60.  The base-case economic internal rate of return for the JVC that will develop and operate \n500  MW  of  renewable  energy  capacity  is  21.1%,  above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%. \nSensitivity  testing  against  four  adverse  scenarios  demonstrates  that  the  investment  is \neconomically robust and viable. \nE.  Justification \n64.  The investment is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 (footnote 19) and Clean Energy and \nEnvironment Program, which calls for ADB to invest up to $1 billion per year in energy efficiency \nand renewable energy in Asia and to sustain that level of investment.24 Significant additions will \nbe made in India\u2019s generation capacity for thermal power to help meet the country\u2019s rapid \ngrowth in electricity demand. Total GHG emissions will, however, also increase as a result. \nADB\u2019s investment in the JVC will enable India to reduce emission intensity in the power sector \nand to bring down incremental increases in GHG emissions by 1.1 million tons of CO  per year, \n2\nwhile pursuing its poverty reduction strategies and economic development. \n \n65.  The proposed investment is consistent with the CSP update (2006\u20132008) and with the \n2009\u20132012 country partnership strategy, now being prepared, to sustain ADB\u2019s support for \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable growth in India (footnote 17). It affirms the strategic \npillars  of  (i)  supporting  the  development  of  a  low-carbon  infrastructure,  particularly  in \nhydropower and other forms of renewable energy; and (ii) catalyzing investment through the use \nof  innovative  business  and  financing  modalities  such  as  public-private  partnerships, \nnonsovereign operations, and the carbon credit market. \n \n66.  The  proposed  investment  will  increase  power  generation  from  renewable  energy \nsources in India, in line with the Government\u2019s objectives stated in the Electricity Act of 2003 \nand  the  Integrated  Energy  Policy.  India  has  been  trying  to  reduce  its  dependence  on \nprice-sensitive fossil fuels and to develop renewable energy sources, which are abundant and \nmostly underused, for energy security and environmentally sustainable economic development. \nOutflows of foreign exchange for imports of fossil fuels, such as coal from Indonesia, Australia, \nand South Africa, will also be reduced. \n \n67.  The proposed JVC will attract private foreign investors who were previously reluctant to \ninvest  directly  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  because  of  the  perceived  risks  and  the \ndominance of local firms. Private investment has been project by project at best. Domestic \ninvestment in wind power was initially encouraging, but most of it was undertaken purely for the \naccelerated-depreciation benefits, or by captive power supply or distribution utilities seeking to \ncomply with renewable energy purchase obligations. The proposed joint venture introduces the \nindependent utility model for renewables, which will help bring down the overall cost of funding \n(and hence the average cost of generation) and prove that this business concept is viable and \n                                                 \n24  The Energy Efficiency Initiative as described and endorsed in ADB. 2007.

This  proof  of  concept  may  change  risk  perceptions  and  attract  other  foreign \ninvestors to the renewable sector in India. \nF.  Anticorruption Policy and Policy of Combating Money Laundering and the \nFinancing of Terrorism \n69.  The investors were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require the JVC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best-practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation among ADB, the other shareholders, \nand the JVC will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertaking. \nVI.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n70.  The proposed financing will be within approved country, industry, project, and group \nexposure limits for nonsovereign operations.  \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n71.  No-Objection  Letter.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the Government of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection \nto the proposed assistance to the JVC. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such \nconfirmation. \n \n72.  Documentation. Following the approval of the proposed investment by the ADB Board \nof Directors, ADB will enter into suitable investment documentation. The documentation will be \non terms and conditions consistent with this document, acceptable to ADB, and consistent with \nall relevant ADB policies. \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n73.

Growth of Generation Capacity \n10.  As the Indian power sector has grown, India has become more and more dependent on \nfossil fuels. With the recent volatility in oil and gas prices, and the expected shortage of fossil \nfuels in the future, there has been increasing concern about the security of India\u2019s energy \nsupply, as well as the environmental effects of excessive use of fossil fuels. India therefore \nurgently needs to explore sustainable energy development, and the Government has been \nworking proactively to promote the use of renewable energy. \n \n11.  Among the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy shows promise. \nIndia has 45,000 megawatts (MW) of gross potential if 1% of land in the potential areas is \nassumed  to  be  available  for  wind-power  generation.  Sites  with  annual  mean  wind  density \nexceeding 200 watts per square meter are considered suitable for wind power projects. The \nCenter for Wind Energy Technology (C-WET) identified 216 such sites in India. The states with \nthe most sites are Tamil Nadu (41), Gujarat (38), Andhra Pradesh (32), Maharashtra (31), and \nKarnataka (26). India\u2019s technical potential is only about 13,000 MW with 20% grid penetration, \nbut  this  figure  should  rise  as  grid  capacity  in  the  potential  states  increases.  As  of \nDecember 2007, India had installed wind power capacity of over 7,800 MW and ranked fourth in \nthe world in this regard, after Germany, Spain, and the United States. A 2,200 MW increase in \ninstalled wind power capacity was targeted in the 10th Five Year Plan; over 5,500 MW has been \ninstalled.25 The installed wind power capacity and gross potential in India, by state, is shown in \nTable A2.1. \n \nTable A2.1: Installed Wind Power Capacity and Potential in India, by State \n(MW) \nAs of  As of  As of \nState  31 March 2005  31 March 2006  31 December 2007  Gross Potential  \nAndhra Pradesh  120.5  121.0  122.5  8,275 \nGujarat  253.5  338.1  874.8  9,675 \nKarnataka  410.8  584.6  917.2  6,620 \nKerala  2.0  2.0  2.0  875 \nMadhya Pradesh  28.9  40.3  70.3  5,500 \nMaharashtra  456.2  1,001.3  1,646.3  3,650 \nRajasthan  284.8  358.1  495.7  1,700 \nTamil Nadu  2,034.9  2,892.5  3,711.6  5,400 \nWest Bengal  1.1  1.1  1.6  3,050 \nOthers  1.6  1.6  2.7  450 \nTotal  3,594.3  5,340.6  7,844.5  45,195 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n \n12.  While the joint venture company (JVC) has no geographic restrictions, it has targeted \ncertain states on the basis of a market assessment and discussions with investors. The states \ntargeted  for  new  wind-turbine  installation  are  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Rajasthan,  and \nMadhya Pradesh.  All  are  leading  states  in  wind  resource  availability  (gross  potential  is \n6,620 MW in Karnataka, 3,650 MW in Maharashtra, 1,700 MW in Rajasthan, and 5,500 MW in \nMadhya Pradesh) and in wind generation capacity (Karnataka has 917 MW of installations, \nMaharashtra  1,646  MW,  Rajasthan  496  MW,  and  Madhya  Pradesh  70  MW).  Wind  power \npotential is already well developed in Tamil Nadu, with 5,400 MW available and 3,712 MW \n                                                 \n25 Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2008.

But since the state is in an advanced state of development, many installed turbines \nare older, and thus less efficient and undersized. Some existing sites can be retrofitted with \nnewer and larger turbines. All of the targeted states actively promote wind power generation and \nhave declared 20-year fixed feed-in tariffs.  \nB.  Regulatory Framework for Wind Power in India \n13.  The  Government  is  proactively  encouraging  the  development  of  renewable  energy \nsources. It started promoting renewable energy in the early 1980s, after the first and second \nglobal oil price shocks. The Commission for Additional Sources of Energy was created in 1981, \nand the Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1982. The latter became the \nMinistry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES) in 1992, and then was renamed the \nMinistry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy  (MNRE)  in  2006.  The  development  of  renewable \nenergy sources is a major goal of the National Electricity Policy, issued by the Ministry of Power \nin 2005. MNRE is the nodal ministry for all matters relating to new and renewable energy. Its \nmain functions are (i) policy making and planning, (ii) program formulation and implementation, \n(iii)  research  and  development,  (iv)  technology  development  and  commercialization, \n(v) promotion of demonstration and pilot projects, and (vi) implementation of fiscal and financial \nincentives. \n \n14.  MNES (now MNRE) established C-WET at Chennai as an autonomous research and \ndevelopment institution of the Government and as a technical focal point for India\u2019s wind power \ndevelopment. The center provides developers with technical services, including wind resource \nassessment for project sites, testing and certification services for equipment, and training and \ncapacity-building services. \n \n15.  Technological advances are gradually producing more commercially viable wind power \nprojects. Wind power has become a more attractive investment with the replacement of the old \n250-kilowatt wind turbines 30 meters (m) high with 1\u20132 MW units 50\u201380 m high. Greater wind \npower density due to the increased height, lower installation cost per MW, and reduced land \nrequirement  make  a  good  case  for  choosing  a  larger  unit  size  of  wind  turbines.  India\u2019s \nadvantage is that it manufactures wind turbines 1 MW and above. \n \n16.  Fiscal and financial incentives from the national and state governments have traditionally \ndriven  the  development  of  wind  power  projects  in  India.  The  incentives  provided  by  the \nGovernment include (i) 80% accelerated depreciation of project costs; (ii) concessions or full \nexemption  from  customs  duties  on  certain  imported  components  of  wind  turbines;  (iii)  tax \nholiday for up to 10 consecutive years within 15 years of commissioning; and (iv) concessional \nloans  through  government-owned  agencies,  including  the  Indian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment Agency, the Power Finance Corporation, and the Rural Electrification Corporation.  \n \n17.  Recently, the focus of the regulatory framework for the renewable energy sector has \nshifted from being supply-driven to being demand-driven. The Electricity Act of 2003 requires all \nstate energy regulatory commissions to ensure that electricity distributors procure a specified \nminimum percentage of power generation from renewable energy sources. 26 In its midterm \n                                                 \n26 Section 86 of the Electricity Act of 2003 states: \u201cThe State Commission shall discharge the following functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e) promote cogeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy by providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof electricity from such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d ", "Appendix 2  19  \nappraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan, the Planning Commission (footnote 1) made the following \nrecommendations regarding the renewable energy sector: \n \n(i)  switch incentives and support from supply-driven programs to demand-driven \nprograms and technologies; \n(ii)  explore alternative subsidy structures that encourage utilities to use wind, small \nhydroelectric, cogeneration, and other nontraditional energy sources; \n(iii)  phase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated; \n(iv)  require  electricity  distributors,  through  the  state  electricity  regulatory \ncommissions, to purchase energy from renewable sources, as provided in the \nElectricity Act; and \n(v)  improve coordination and synergy between the programs of MNES (now MNRE) \nand similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \nC.  Wind Power in Target States \n18.  The  target  states  of  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Rajasthan,  and \nTamil Nadu are among India\u2019s leading states in wind energy generation, with a gross potential \nof about 22,870 MW. As of 31 December 2007, these states had an installed wind generation \ncapacity of 6,841 MW. Their potential for further wind generation is therefore significant. \n \n19.  Each of the target states has passed regulations to encourage wind power generation. In \naccordance with the tariff policies of the Government, the states have issued renewable energy \npurchase obligations requiring distribution licensees to purchase a minimum quantity of total \nelectricity consumption from renewable sources (Table A2.2). \n \n20.  Each of the target states has declared power purchase agreement (PPA) conditions and \napproved standard PPAs to be executed between the generator and the distribution licensee \naccording to the terms indicated in Table A2.2. All states have \u201ctake-and-pay\u201d provisions for \npower offtake, with \u201cmust-run\u201d status in the merit-order dispatch. \n \nTable A2.2: Wind Power Policies, by State \nMadhya \nPolicy Item  Karnataka  Pradesh  Maharashtra  Rajasthan  Tamil Nadu \nRenewable energy  5%  0.5%  6.0% minimum  6.0% minimum  Obligations set \npurchase obligation   minimum,  minimum  for 2009\u20132010  for 2009\u20132010;  for each \n10%  increasing to  distribution \nmaximum  7.5% for 2011\u2013 licensee from \n2012  0.95% to 3.8% \nTariff order duration (years)  10  20  13  20  20 \nFeed-in tariff (Rs/kWh)  3.40  4.03  3.50  3.78  3.40 \nEscalation  None  Declines  Above rate +  None  None \ngradually to  Rs0.15/kWh per \nRs3.36/kWh  year \nby year 20 \nShare of CDM revenue with  0%  0%  0%  25%  50% proposed \ndistribution licensee(s) \nOther incentives  No  No electricity  Support for  50% duty  \u2013 \nelectricity  duty for  infrastructure  exemption for \nduty for  5 years  and evacuation  7 years \n5 years  costs \nCDM = Clean Development Mechanism, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Wind Power India.

Among the renewable power resources available in India, a promising source for further \ndevelopment is small hydropower. This consists of hydroelectric generation stations with a \ncapacity of up to 25 megawatts (MW), typically run-of-river or small pondage installations with \nminimal inundation zones for storage or none. India ranks fifth in the world in usable potential, \ndistributed across six major river systems\u2014the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Ganga, the central \nIndian  river  systems,  and  the  east-  and  west-flowing  river  systems  of  south  India.1 The \neconomically exploitable potential from these river systems has been assessed at just over \n84,000  MW  in  delivered  capacity,  accounting  for  load  factor,  topographic  features,  and \nwatershed hydrology. So far only 32,325 MW has been established. Included in the assessment \nis  nearly  10,000  MW  in  small  hydroelectric  power  development  potential  distributed  over \n4,000 sites with an estimated unidentified potential of an additional 5,000 MW. \n \n2.  The hydroelectric power sector was opened to private sector participation in 1991, but \nonly about 910 MW, or less than 3% of the total installed hydropower capacity, has been \ncommissioned so far. The hydro-rich states of Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand \nhave adopted several measures in recent years to promote the balanced growth of public and \nprivate  sector  projects.

Recently, the focus of the regulatory framework for the renewable energy sector has \nshifted from being supply-driven to being demand-driven. The Electricity Act of 2003 requires all \nstate energy regulatory commissions to ensure that electricity distributors procure a specified \nminimum percentage of power generation from renewable energy sources.3 In its midterm \nappraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan, the Planning Commission (footnote 1) made the following \nrecommendations regarding the renewable energy sector: \n \n(i)  switch incentives and support from supply-driven programs to demand-driven \nprograms and technologies; \n(ii)  explore alternative subsidy structures that encourage utilities to use wind, small \nhydroelectric, cogeneration, and other nontraditional energy sources; \n(iii)  phase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated; \n(iv)  require  electricity  distributors,  through  the  state  electricity  regulatory \ncommissions, to purchase energy from renewable sources, as provided in the \nElectricity Act; and \n(v)  improve coordination and synergy between the programs of MNES (now MNRE) \nand similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n \n5.  The National Tariff Policy 2005 requires distribution companies to procure their future \nhydropower requirements from the generation companies through competitive bidding. Central \nand state public utilities have a 5-year window within which to implement the bidding framework. \nThe terms and conditions laid down by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) \nfor  tariff  setting  include  0.2%\u20130.7%  auxiliary  energy  consumption,  based  on  generator \nconfiguration, and recovery of full capacity charges based on the capacity indexes indicated in \nTable A3.2. \n \nTable A3.2: Norms of Operation for Recovery of Capacity Charges \n(%) \nCapacity Index in  Capacity Index \nYear 1 of  after Year 1 of \nCommercial  Commercial \nPower Station Type  Operation  Operation  \nPurely run-of-river  85  90 \nStorage-type or run-of-river \n80  85 \n     with pondage           \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n6.

For structures at less than \n30% equity, the tariff may be determined at the actual debt and equity. \n \n7.  The tariff is a two-part structure, comprising recovery of annual capacity charges and \nprimary energy charges. Project capital is recovered through the annual capacity charge, and \nvariable costs through the energy charges. The rate of primary energy charge is equal to the \nlowest variable charge of the central sector thermal power station in the region. Generation \nperformance incentives are payable when the capacity index4 exceeds the values indicated in \nTable  A3.2,  accrued  up  to  a  maximum  of  100%.  Additionally,  an  incentive  for  early \ncommissioning is payable for an amount of pro rata reduction in interest during construction \nrecovered through the tariff in 12 equal monthly installments for the first 12 months of operation. \n \n8.  Despite this regulatory framework and progress made in the sector, the development of \nsmall hydropower projects has been impeded by various factors. Barriers specific to private \nsector small hydropower development include (i) long project gestation periods, (ii) high capital \ncosts, (iii) statutory clearances, (iv) geologic uncertainties, (v) land acquisition difficulties, and \n(vi) resettlement and rehabilitation problems (in some cases). In addition, the absence of a \nstreamlined single-window clearance system can delay the approval process and be a setback \nfor  organizations  not  familiar  with  the  process.  To  assist  developers  in  overcoming  these \nbarriers,  MNRE  provides  financial  and  technical  support  to  state  hydropower  development \ninitiatives. Three states in particular have adopted initiatives to promote the growth of private \nsector projects, as discussed below.5 \n \n9.  Himachal Pradesh. The key features of the state\u2019s policy are (i) developers are selected \nthrough the memorandum of understanding route for projects of up to 100 MW; (ii) no CEA \nclearances are required for projects of up to Rs25 billion, selected through competitive bidding; \n(iii) a premium is paid on peak power; and (iv) 100% foreign equity is permitted on the automatic \napproval route for projects of up to Rs15 billion. Through a multitranche financing facility to \nHimachal Pradesh Power Corporation, ADB is supporting four hydroelectric power projects (111 \nMW, 195 MW, 100 MW, and 402 MW). \n \n10.  Sikkim. The Sikkim Power Development Corporation Limited (SPDCL) facilitates joint \nventure projects between private power developers and the Government. SPDCL-sponsored \nprojects have the following key features: (i) 12% free power is made available to the state, (ii) \nthe project may sell the balance directly to states or power trading agencies on a merchant \nbasis, and (iii) the Government has equity participation of 10%\u201349%. \n \n11.  Uttarakhand. The key features of the state\u2019s policy for private sector development are \nas follows: (i) potential projects are advertised for international competitive bidding, (ii) projects \nare  awarded  on  the  basis  of  the  highest  bid  over  the  up-front  minimum  premium, \n(iii) concessions  are  granted  through  45-year  build-own-operate-transfer  contracts, \n(iv) developers may sell the power outside the state, and (v) up to 12% of the power generated \ncan be captured by the state\u2019s free power program. Through a multitranche financing facility, \nADB is funding four small hydropower projects in Uttarakhand (10 MW Madhyamaheshwar, \n4 MW Kaliganga-I, 6 MW Kaliganga-II, and 9 MW Kaldigad). \n                                                 \n4  Capacity index\u2014the ratio of declared capacity to the maximum available capacity\u2014has been adopted by the \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission as a standard parameter for hydropower in lieu of plant load factor. \nCapacity index is essentially a declaration of machine availability independent of water availability; therefore, \nhydrological risk is passed on directly to beneficiaries. \n5  ADB. 2007.

NTPC Limited (formerly known as National Thermal Power Generation Limited) is a \ngovernment-owned entity with 89.5% of its paid-up capital contributed by the Government and \nthe balance of 10.5% being held by foreign institutional investors, financial institutions, banks, \nand  the  general  public.  NTPC  is  India\u2019s  largest  producer  of  thermal  power.1 Although  the \nGovernment is the majority owner, NTPC is considered a navratna company, that is, it operates \nunder the Companies Act like a private company and its management can make operating \ndecisions  without  interference  from  the  Government.  As  of  31 December  2008,  the  total \ninstalled capacity of NTPC was 29,894 megawatts (MW), through 15 coal-fired power stations \n(23,895 MW), seven gas-fired power stations (3,955 MW), and three joint venture projects \n(2,044 MW). NTPC had a 19.6% share of the total installed capacity in India as of that date, and \nit contributed 27.1% of total power generation in the country in FY2005. \n \n2.  NTPC is expanding its business into hydroelectric power generation, coal mining, gas \nexploration, and the liquefied natural gas value chain, to supplement and support its core power \ngeneration activities. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, NTPC proposes to implement and \noperate small to medium-sized hydroelectric power plants and engage in power trading and \ndistribution. It is also involved in several joint ventures, including one with Alstom, Germany, for \nthe  renovation  and  modernization  of  third-party  power  plants  in  India  and  other  member \ncountries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n  2.  Assets and Operations \n3.  NTPC has a current installed capacity of 29,894 MW. It plans to become a generation \ncompany with power generation of more than 46,000 MW by the end of the 11th Plan period \n(end of 2012) and more than 66,000 MW by the end of the 12th Plan period (end of 2017). \nNTPC  is  adopting  a  multipronged  growth  strategy  for  capacity  addition  through  greenfield \nprojects, expansion of existing stations, acquisitions and takeovers, and joint ventures and \nsubsidiaries. Aside from the 4,000 MW already commissioned during the 10th Plan period and \n8,970 MW under implementation during the 10th and 11th plan periods, the new generation \nprojects identified for implementation include both greenfield projects and the expansion of \nexisting power plants.  \n \n4.  The  engineering,  construction,  and  operation  of  power  plants  for  thermal  power \ngeneration is the core business of NTPC. Sales of energy accounted for 93% of its operating \nincome in FY2008. NTPC\u2019s facilities are located throughout India, but mostly in the central and \neastern  states.  The  company  is  also  looking  to  invest  in  power  generation  facilities  in \nneighboring countries like Sri Lanka. \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Power. 2005.

The \ndividend paid for FY2007 was Rs28,859 million, or 38.9% of profits after tax, not far different \nfrom the Rs26,385 million paid for the previous fiscal year. NTPC\u2019s dividend target is 30% of \nprofit after tax, but NTPC is allowed to use its internal resources to fund capacity expansion. \nDividends are declared and paid at the board\u2019s recommendation and with the approval of the \nshareholders. \n \n6.  The operating performance of NTPC has been considerably above the national average. \nThe increase in the availability factor for coal stations, from 85.03% in FY1997 to 92.12% in   \nFY2007, compares favorably with international standards. The plant load factor increased from \n75.2% in FY1997 to 92.24% in FY2007, its highest level since the start.

Guiding Principles \n1.  After incorporation, the joint venture company (JVC) will formulate a corporate policy for \nenvironmental and social management and establish an environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) consistent with the safeguard policy principles and requirements of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The guiding principles are as follows: \n(i)  compliance  by  the  JVC  with  ADB\u2019s  applicable  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  policies,1 and  the  environmental  and  social  laws  and  policies  (on \nlabor,2 land acquisition, and resettlement) of India; \n(ii)  integration  of  an  assessment  of  compliance  with  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards in the due diligence and risk assessment by the JVC; \n(iii)  establishment  of  a  process  or  system  for  screening,  categorization  and \nclassification, and assessment, to identify and monitor the adverse environmental \nand social impact of the JVC\u2019s projects; \n(iv)  identification of appropriate mitigation and compensation measures to minimize \nadverse  impact  in  line  with  international  best  practices  and  applicable \nenvironmental and social safeguards; \n(v)  public  disclosure  of  information  about  the  projects\u2019  environmental  and  social \nimpact;  \n(vi)  promotion  of  compliance  by  the  investee  with  applicable  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards, including India\u2019s resettlement laws and standards, through \nappropriate  documentation  of  environmental  and  social  impact  studies, \napprovals, and site visits as appropriate; \n(vii)  where  applicable,  in  case  of  breach  of  the  environmental  and  social  policy \nrequirements of ADB, or the laws and standards of the Government of India, \nprompt collaboration in the preparation of an action plan; and  \n(viii)  appropriate staffing of the JVC to enable it to implement the ESMS. \nB.  Environmental and Social Management System \n2.  The JVC will establish and adopt an ESMS consistent with ADB\u2019s environmental and \nsocial safeguard policies. The ESMS will comprise (i) the environmental and social safeguard \npolicy, signed by senior management; (ii) environmental management capability; (iii) procedures \nfor the environmental assessment and review of subprojects; and (iv) environmental monitoring \nand reporting procedures.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB has three safeguard policies: the Environment Policy (2002), the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and \nthe Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). ADB investees are legally obligated to comply with these policies. \n2  In addition to the three policies mentioned in footnote 1, ADB has a Social Protection Strategy, which recommends \nbest practices with regard to labor markets, social insurance, social assistance, micro- and area-based schemes, \nand child protection. Although compliance with the Social Protection Strategy is not a legal requirement, it is a \ndesirable extension of the JVC\u2019s approach to environmental and social protection. Additional guidance on the \nSocial Protection Strategy is available at http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection. \n ", "Appendix 6  29  \n \n1.   Environmental and Social Management System Policy \n3.  As part of the process of establishing an ESMS, the JVC will prepare and adopt an \nenvironmental and social safeguard policy statement signed by its senior management, which \nstipulates, among other things, that  \n(i)  the JVC\u2019s projects should be consistent with its policies on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples and scheduled tribes,3 as well \nas other social and disclosure policy requirements;  \n(ii)  the  JVC  should  actively  observe  all  applicable  environmental  and  social \nrequirements of the national and local governments of India, particularly those \ngoverning  land  acquisition,  compensation,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples;  \n(iii)  the JVC should also follow internationally recognized labor practices consistent \nwith national labor laws and regulations; and  \n(iv)  if  the  JVC  contravenes  applicable  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements, ADB will take action to understand the reasons for noncompliance \nand will discuss corrective actions acceptable to the relevant authorities.  \n4.  Wherever the relevant projects of the JVC involve involuntary resettlement4 impact, the \nJVC  will  satisfy  itself  that  it  has  (i)  avoided  involuntary  resettlement  wherever  feasible; \n(ii) minimized resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable; and (iii) ensured that \naffected persons5 have been compensated and assisted through replacement of land, housing, \ninfrastructure,  resources,  income  sources,  and  services,  in  cash  or  in  kind,  so  that  their \neconomic  and  social  circumstances  will  be  at  least  restored  to  the  pre-project  level.  All \ncompensation will be based on the principle of replacement cost.  \n5.  Wherever the projects of the JVC affect indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes, the JVC \nwill satisfy itself that it has (i) avoided negative impact on indigenous peoples or scheduled \ntribes, where possible; (ii) provided adequate and appropriate compensation where negative \nimpact  is  unavoidable;  and  (iii)  ensured  that  development  initiatives  affecting  indigenous \npeoples are effective and sustainable, and are compatible in substance and structure with their \ncultures and social and economic institutions, and commensurate with their needs, aspirations, \nand demands. \n                                                 \n3  Scheduled tribes or indigenous people are those with a social or cultural identity distinct from that of the dominant \nor mainstream society, making them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the process of development. \n4  ADB defines \u201cinvoluntary resettlement\u201d as social and economic impact that is permanent or temporary and is \ncaused by (i) the acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) a change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions \nimposed on land as a result of an ADB operation. \n5  The term \u201caffected person\u201d includes any people, households, firms, or private institutions that, on account of \nchanges resulting from the project, will have their (i) standard of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or interest \nin any house, land (residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, or grazing land), water resources, or any other \nmovable or fixed assets acquired, possessed, restricted, or otherwise adversely affected, in full or in part, \npermanently or temporarily; or (iii) business, occupation, place of work or residence, or habitat adversely affected, \nwith or without displacement. \n ", " 30  Appendix 6 \n \n2.  Environmental and Social Management System Procedures \n6.  Screening. Before making any specific investment, the JVC will verify to ADB that the \nproposed project is not on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. The JVC will undertake an initial \nassessment of whether the project, in its reasonable opinion, has the potential to have adverse \nenvironmental or social impact or may involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, or \naffect indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes. These issues will continue to be assessed during \ndue  diligence,  to  ensure  that  the  project  complies  with  the  environmental  and  social \nrequirements of India. The JVC will develop and implement a rigorous screening system to \nassess whether the proposed projects have adequately addressed the environmental and social \nsafeguards.  \n7.  Projects  are  categorized  according  to  the  significance  of  their  impact  on  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The significance of the impact \nis measured by its type, location, scale, nature, and magnitude. ADB has several categories of \nprojects, depending on their environmental and social impact, as follows.  \na.  Environmental  \n8.  Category A. Category A projects are those with anticipated significant adverse impact \non the environment. In this category are the following types of projects: thermal power and \nhydropower plants; irrigation systems; roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, and airports; forestry; \nfarming; general construction; waste processing and disposal facilities (landfill, transfer station, \nand incineration); mining, oil extraction, and refinery; iron, steel, and metal production; chemical \nplant installation; skin and hide processing, and tanneries; sawdust processing, and pulp and \npaper production; and establishment of artificial lakes or reservoirs. Category A projects will \nrequire an adequately prepared environmental impact assessment (EIA) with an environmental \nmanagement plan and an environmental monitoring program.  \n9.  Category B. Projects with anticipated insignificant adverse impact on the environment \nare in category B.6 Included here are transmission lines and substations; wind power projects; \nrehabilitation of power plants, factories, or roads within the same corridor or footprint; and other \ndevelopments where the anticipated adverse impact is insignificant. Category B projects will \nrequire the preparation of an initial environmental examination (IEE) with an environmental \nmitigation and monitoring program. A project listed (by type) as category B but deemed to be of \nsignificant anticipated environmental impact can be determined to be a category A project by \nthe JVC.  \n10.  Category C. In this category are projects with no anticipated adverse impact on the \nenvironment. Category C projects require no impact assessment studies. \nb.  Social \n11.  Category A. Projects where 200 or more people will experience major impact from \ninvoluntary resettlement\u2014physical displacement from housing or loss of 10% or more of their \nproductive (income-generating) assets\u2014are in category A. A full resettlement plan is required \nfor such projects. A project\u2019s impact is also considered significant if it positively or negatively \n                                                 \n6  Under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), a project is classified as category B if its potential environmental and \nsocial impact is less adverse than that of category A projects. Typically, the impact is site-specific, rarely \nirreversible, and can readily be mitigated. \n ", "Appendix 6  31  \n \n(i) affects indigenous peoples\u2019 or scheduled tribes\u2019 customary rights of use and access to land \nand natural resources; (ii) changes indigenous peoples\u2019 or scheduled tribes\u2019 socioeconomic \nstatus; (iii) affects indigenous peoples\u2019 or scheduled tribes\u2019 cultural and communal integrity; \n(iv) affects  indigenous  peoples\u2019  or  scheduled  tribes\u2019  health,  education,  livelihood,  or  social \nsecurity; or (v) alters or undermines the recognition of indigenous knowledge. For projects that \nsignificantly affect indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes, an indigenous peoples development \nplan (IPDP) or a scheduled tribes development plan (STDP) is prepared. \n  \n12.  Category B. Projects where fewer than 200 people will experience major impact from \ninvoluntary resettlement are in category B. These projects require a short resettlement plan. \nProjects that are expected to have limited impact on indigenous peoples and scheduled tribes \nrequire a specific action favorable to indigenous peoples in the project design or in related plans \n(e.g., a resettlement plan).  \n \n13.  Category  C.  Projects  in  this  category  are  not  expected  to  have  any  impact  on \nindigenous peoples or to lead to involuntary resettlement. Category C projects do not require \nany plans to be prepared. \n \n14.  Impact Assessment and Safeguards Planning. If the JVC determines that a project \ncould have significant adverse environmental or social impact, or could involve involuntary \nresettlement or affect indigenous people, it will, before providing any financial assistance, \n(i)  consult with and assist in providing advisory or other services related to the \nsafeguards to the client; and \n(ii)  where the project has significant impact on the environment, prepare a feasibility \nstudy  (or  review  the  existing  study),  to  include  an  environmental  and  social \nassessment, which addresses the following key environmental and social issues: \n(a)  environmental  and  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  investment,  including \ncareful consideration of gender issues in the conduct of social analysis or \nconsultation  with  women\u2019s  groups  during  preparation,  to  ensure  that \nwomen participate and receive benefits; \n(b)  requirements under relevant Indian laws and regulations, and applicable \ninternational agreements, including but not limited to laws and regulations \ngoverning land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples; \n(c)  sustainable development and use of renewable natural resources; \n(d)  protection of human health, cultural properties, and biodiversity, including \nendangered species and sensitive ecosystems; \n(e)  land acquisition and land use; \n(f)  impact on indigenous peoples, scheduled tribes, and communities; \n(g)  cumulative environmental and social impact of existing, proposed, and \nanticipated future investments; \n(h)  disclosure of impact and mitigation measures to affected parties and the \nparticipation of those parties in the design and review of mitigation and \nrehabilitation measures; \n(i)  consideration  of  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically  feasible \nalternatives; and \n ", " 32  Appendix 6 \n \n(j)  pollution prevention and waste minimization, pollution (liquid effluents and \nair emissions) control, and solid and chemical waste management.  \n15.  For greenfield development or the rehabilitation or expansion of existing facilities, the \nJVC will conduct screening, categorization, and environmental due diligence to determine the \nrequired level of environmental assessment for each subproject. During the implementation of \nthe subproject, the JVC will be required to comply with the environmental management plan and \nthe environmental monitoring program indicated in the EIA or IEE. Wherever an EIA is required, \na summary EIA must be prepared and posted on ADB\u2019s website for a specific period of time \nbefore ADB may approve the project.7  \n16.  If  greenfield  development  is  involved,  the  JVC  will  determine  whether  indigenous \npeoples will be affected, and land acquisition and involuntary resettlement may be involved. If \nthe  JVC  cannot  reasonably  satisfy  itself  that  the  project  complies  with  all  applicable \nenvironmental and social requirements of the Indian national and local governments, and that \nindigenous peoples and scheduled tribes will not be affected and the project will involve no \ninvoluntary resettlement, the JVC will  \n \n(i)  decline to invest in such project; or \n(ii)  implement an agreed corrective action plan within a specified period of time; or  \n(iii)  if involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes \ncannot be avoided, the JVC will prepare and submit a resettlement plan or an \nIPDP or STDP, according to the policy outlined in section 3 of the SPRSS \n(Appendix 7). The plans must satisfy the JVC that impact on indigenous peoples \nor  scheduled  tribes  will  be  mitigated  and  involuntary  resettlement  will  be \nminimized,  and  that  the  affected  people  will  receive  compensation  at \nreplacement cost. During the implementation of the investment, the JVC will \nmonitor the implementation of resettlement plans and IPDPs or STDPs, and \nensure that such plans are made available to the public.  \n \n17.  If the project involves rehabilitation or expansion of existing facilities, the JVC manager \nwill conduct due diligence to determine if there are any outstanding compensation or involuntary \nresettlement issues, unaddressed adverse impact on ethnic minorities, unresolved grievances, \nor related areas of reputational risk to the JVC and to ADB. If there are any outstanding \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  issues,  the  JVC  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare \ncorrective measures in the form of a retrofit plan to comply with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policy \nrequirements.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe equity investment will increase the number of renewable energy projects in India and help meet the demand for energy in \na sustainable manner. Availability of clean and reliable sources of energy is expected to improve the local economy, and \nthereby create more work opportunities for the population including the poor. The investment is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020 and Clean Energy and Environment Program, which calls for ADB investments in energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy in Asia to reach about $1 billion per year. It is also expected to increase power generation from renewable energy \nsources in India, in line with the Government\u2019s objectives in the Electricity Act of 2003 and the Power for All by 2012 initiative. \nThe investment is consistent with the CSP update (2006\u20132008) and with the CPS (2009\u20132012) now being prepared to sustain \nADB\u2019s support for inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth in India. It is consistent with the strategic pillars of \n(i) supporting the development of a low-carbon infrastructure, explicitly in hydropower and other renewable energy forms; and \n(ii) catalyzing investment through the use of innovative business and financing modalities such as public-private partnerships, \nnonsovereign operations, and the carbon credit market. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues. The availability of electric power, and more broadly infrastructure, has an indirect but strong link with poverty \nreduction and economic growth. The availability of reliable power supply from renewable sources will encourage the growth of \nlocal enterprises, the development of good transport and communications systems, and the improvement of health and other \nsocial services, ultimately resulting in more employment and improved living conditions for the poor in the areas where \nrenewable energy projects will be developed.  \n2. Design Features. The investment will achieve an outcome of 500 MW of additional renewable power generation by 2012 \nby implementing projects through public-private partnership, thus catalyzing investment from the private sector and delivering \nmaximum value to the public sector. The addition of 500 MW in renewable energy capacity would provide about 1.1 GWh of \nadditional electricity per year and thus help to bridge the persistent energy deficits and load shedding disproportionately \naffecting India\u2019s poor, who have little or no access to electricity. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending Not applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of the Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. Social impact assessments will be undertaken as part of the feasibility studies to be conducted for each project \nto be developed by the JVC. Given the nature and general location of projects, the investment has been classified as B/C \nunder ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and B from the perspective of ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998). The JVC will be required to adopt and maintain an environment and social management system (ESMS) approved in \nform and substance by ADB. The ESMS will include principles, policies, and procedures for addressing the involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous people impact of projects. Each project will be classified for involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous people impact; wherever potential impact is identified, the JVC will prepare the necessary social safeguard plans \nand actions and submit these to ADB for review and approval.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nFor future projects to be developed by the JVC, consultation and participation activities will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements and the ESMS approved in form and substance by ADB.  \n ", "Appendix 7   35  \n \n \n2.

Assumptions \n1.  General \n1.  The economic analysis for the investment has been carried out in line with a standard \ncost-benefit analysis framework, and in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.1 All  economic  costs  and  benefits  are \nexpressed in constant 2009 domestic prices. \n2.  Demand and Supply of Power  \n2.  India suffers from chronic energy and power shortages. The main reason for this has \nbeen that capacity additions have lagged significantly behind demand growth. For example, \nduring the 10th Five Year Plan period (FY2003\u2013FY2007) only 52% of the targeted capacity \nadditions were achieved. Though there has been an absolute increase in capacity and in the \nper capita  consumption  of  electricity,  the  per  capita  consumption  is  a  fraction  of  that  in \ndeveloped countries and also much lower than in some developing countries like the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. The current per capita electricity consumption in India is 700 kWh, compared \nwith 1,200 kWh in the People\u2019s Republic of China and 13,000 kWh in the United States. The \nGovernment of India has highlighted a vision of \u201cPower for All\u201d by 2012 when currently only \n55.8% of the households have access to electricity. The Planning Commission has estimated an \nelectricity-GDP elasticity of 1 and projected GDP to grow at 8% over the medium term. Even \nwith the current global economic downturn and with the lowering of GDP growth rates for \nFY2010, GDP is expected to grow at 5%\u20136%. \n \n3.  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) undertakes periodic electric power surveys to \nproject the energy requirement of the country and guide the planning process for capacity \naddition. CEA released its 17th electric power survey in March 2007 with detailed estimates of \nthe growth in power demand, region-wise and for the country as a whole. Table A9.1 shows the \nlong-term projected energy requirement across various regions in the country. \n \nTable A9.1: Project Energy Requirements \n \n  Energy Requirement (GWh)    Peak Load (MW) \nRegion/States  FY2011  FY2016  FY2021  FY2011  FY2016  FY2021 \nNorthern  294,841  411,513  556,768  48,137  66,583  89,913 \nWestern  294,841  409,805  550,022  47,108  64,349  84,778 \nGujarat  85,445  119,083  156,842  14,374  19,670  25,447 \nSouthern  253,443  380,068  511,659  40,367  60,433  80,485 \nKarnataka  53,540  79,996  107,471  8,826  13,092  17,464 \nEastern  111,802  168,942  258,216  19,088  28,401  42,712 \nNortheastern  13,329  21,143  36,997  2,537  3,760  6,180 \nIslands  384  595  847  88  136  151 \nAll India  968,659  1,392,006  1,914,508  152,746  218,209  298,253 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Central Electricity Authority. 2007.

The  investment  would  develop  and  operate  wind-power  projects  in  Maharashtra, \nKarnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Madhya Pradesh, and small hydroelectric projects in \nHimachal Pradesh. In the hilly and mountainous terrains of Himachal Pradesh, off-grid hydro \nmay be the only source of electricity in the foreseeable future.  \n \n5.  The major economic benefit from the investment is the electricity generated, which is \nfully absorbed at current levels of electricity demand in the states identified. These states face \npeak and energy shortages, which are projected to persist in the future. Lack of adequate \nelectricity will adversely affect economic growth and development.  \n3.  Economic Costs \n6.  Capital costs include the cost of developing 500 MW of wind and small hydroelectric \nprojects, as detailed in the main text, and a conservative adjustment of 10% tax to exclude \ntaxes in the calculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). O&M costs for generation \nhave been adjusted to remove the escalation factor. \n4.  Economic Benefits \n7.  Given the shortages in meeting energy and peak demand in the offtaking states, all the \nelectricity generated by the investment will meet unmet demand, that is, it would not substitute \npower from any existing generation capacity. The entire output from the projects is considered \nincremental. The economic value of the incremental electricity generated is the cost paid by \neach state for power purchased. The energy charge paid is linked to the cost of supply of the \nlowest-cost thermal plant. This is taken to reflect the willingness to pay for the incremental \nsupply of electricity in that state.  \n \n8.  As the investment develops renewable energy technologies, another benefit will be the \nreduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The investment is likely to generate certified \nemission reductions (CERs) of GHGs, the sale of which will generate additional revenue. Even \nin the absence of CER registration and revenue, the investment continues to contribute to the \noverall  reduction  of  GHGs.  The  investment  generates  a  benefit  (with  or  without  the  CER \nrevenue), which is the lowering of GHG emissions. The estimated reductions in emissions are \nbased on the carbon emissions reduction factor determined by the Central Electricity Authority. \nThe carbon emissions reduction is valued at a price of \u20ac8 per ton of CO  (about $10 per ton of \n2\nCO )2 for  20  years,  as  this  is  a  global  benefit  that  will  accrue  over  the  entire  life  of  the \n2\ninvestment. For illustrative purposes, the analysis was done with and without the benefit of the \nGHG reductions. The inclusion of the benefit of GHG abatement increases the EIRR by 2.4% in \nthe base case. Other local environmental benefits like lower suspended particulate matter and \nthe related health benefits are not included in the quantitative analysis. As these would have a \nnet positive contribution to benefits, the current analysis of economic return is conservative. \n5.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n9.  A consolidated EIRR is calculated for all the subprojects to determine the economic \nviability of the total investment. The base case EIRR is estimated at 21.1%. The results of the \neconomic analysis for the base case have been summarized in Table A9.2. The sensitivity of \nthe EIRR was tested under four adverse scenarios: (i) a 10% decrease in output, (ii) a 20% \n                                                 \n2  As of 06 March 2009, \u20ac1 = $1.27. \n ", "38   Appendix 9 \nincrease  in  O&M  costs,  (iii)  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  and  (iv)  the  simultaneous \noccurrence of cases (i) to (iii).
