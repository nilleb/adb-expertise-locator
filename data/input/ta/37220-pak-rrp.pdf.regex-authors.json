An environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen prepared to guide environmental assessment of subprojects \nduring implementation.  \nInvestment  The Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program (the Investment \nProgram  Program  or  SCIP)  aims  to  improve  water  supply,  wastewater \nDescription  management,  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  services  in \nclusters of secondary cities in Sindh Province, thus enhancing the \nurban environment, public health, and economic opportunities for an \nestimated 4 million urban residents of participating secondary cities. \nThis will be achieved through an integrated program of physical and \nnonphysical  investments  in  institutional  reforms  and  priority \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvements.  Urban  services \ncorporations  (USCs),  established  as  public  limited  companies  by \nparticipating local governments to deliver the services, represent a \ncore institutional reform. The Investment Program has four parts: (i) \npart  A:  urban  planning,  institutional  development,  and  program \nimplementation  support  for  program  execution  and  institutional \nreforms;  (ii)  part  B:  water  supply  and  wastewater  management \nimprovements  to  boost  service  coverage,  quality,  and  reliability \nthrough  civil  works  and  equipment  provision;  (iii)  part  C:  SWM \nimprovements comprising the provision of civil works and equipment \nrequired  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  sanitary  landfill \nfacilities,  solid  waste  collection  equipment,  and  communal  waste \nbins; and (iv) part D: operational and transition support funding to \ncover cash shortfalls in the newly established USCs in advance of \nplanned tariff increases and greater cost recovery. \n \nParts B and C will finance physical outputs including (i) increased \nconnections to piped water supply and reduced system leakage; (ii) \nincreased  wastewater  disposal  and  capacity  for  wastewater \ntreatment; and (iii) development of sanitary landfills and increased \naccess to solid waste collection.   \n \nParts  A  and  D  will  finance  non-physical  outputs  including  (i) \nimproved institutions and incentives for urban service delivery; (ii) \n ", "ii   \ncapacity  development  for  better  system  planning,  operations  and \nmaintenance; (iii) enhanced cost recovery through metering, billing \nand  collection  tariffs;  and  (iv)  increased  efficiency  through \npredictable recurrent financing and performance-based contracting \nand private sector participation. \n \nMultitranche  The Government of Pakistan has requested the Asian Development \nFinance Facility  Bank (ADB) to extend financing for the Investment Program through \nModality  a multitranche financing facility (MFF). The requested MFF totals \n$300  million  to  finance  infrastructure  investments,  capacity \ndevelopment,  operational  funding  shortfalls,  and  the  Investment \nProgram\u2019s implementation costs. The MFF modality is justified based \non the following: \n(i)  The MFF establishes a foundation for a 10-year partnership \nbetween  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Sindh  (GOS)  to \nrevitalize Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities. \n(ii)  It avoids the piecemeal approach of past urban projects by \nbuilding a broad platform for engaging GOS on core reforms. \n(iii)  The modality provides for logical sequencing of interrelated \nphysical and nonphysical investments over the medium-term \nto  support  long-term  GOS  objectives  for  balanced  urban \ndevelopment.  \n(iv)  It  allows  phasing  of  physical  investments  in  new  \u201ctown \nclusters\u201d  once  institutional  reforms  are  in  place  and  USCs \nestablished.  \n(v)  Multiple tranches provide flexibility to adjust investment levels, \nwith  tranche  amounts  increasing  over  time  as  a  corporate \nmodel  is  adopted  and  geographical  coverage  of  USCs \nincreases.  \n(vi)  The  MFF  allows  piloting  of  approaches,  then  applying \nexperience to subsequent tranches and town clusters for more \nefficient implementation. \n(vii)  Financing on an as-needed basis can lower transaction costs. \n(viii)  The MFF shifts focus to implementation, rather than repetitive \nprocessing  tasks,  while  internalizing  subproject  preparation \nskills. \n(ix)  It complements ADB\u2019s proposed MFF for urban development \nin Karachi, providing a balanced approach to province-wide \nurban development. \n \nConditions for an MFF are satisfied. The sector strategy and policy \nframework, including actionable reforms, investment program, and \nfinancing  plan  are  in  Appendix  3.  Management  and  institutional \nreforms  are  front-loaded  to  establish  a  foundation  for  physical \ninvestment. \n \nRationale  Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities are under increasing stress of population \ngrowth and urban poverty. The provision of urban infrastructure and \nservices has not kept pace with the population. Inadequate planning \nand management of infrastructure services keeps costs high and \nquality  low  while  impeding  Sindh\u2019s  economic  competitiveness. \n ", "  iii\nDeteriorating  urban  services  add  to  business  costs,  damage  the \nurban  environment,  diminish  the  quality  of  life,  and  discourage \npotential  investment.  Devolution  reforms  have  had  disappointing \neffect since 2001. While providing scope for more effective service \nprovision, improvements are hindered by continuing overlaps and \nfragmentation  of  responsibilities  between  the  taluka  municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs)  and  provincial-level  agencies.  Alternative \napproaches  to  service  provision,  including  infrastructure  planning \nand  construction,  are  needed  to  address  the  challenges  facing \nSindh\u2019s second-tier cities. Service delivery needs to be separated \nfrom system regulation and political interest. Service provision needs \nto  be  progressively  placed  on  a  commercial  and  self-sustaining \nbasis, leveraging private sector expertise and incentive structures as \nappropriate. \n   \nImpact and  The Investment Program\u2019s impact will be improved health and quality \nOutcome  of life for an estimated 4 million residents in Sindh\u2019s participating \nsecondary  towns  and  improved  economic  competitiveness  of  the \ntowns.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  quality,  coverage,  and \nreliability of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services for an \nestimated 570,000 households in participating cities, through reforms \nthat include introducing well-managed, financially sustainable urban \nservice providers and more effective urban planning, while creating a \nplatform for increased private sector participation in the sector. \n \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  $400 \nmillion, of which $300 million would be covered under the MFF. The \nestimated total needs for infrastructure services investment under \nthe sector road map and investment program is an estimated $2.3 \nbillion for the period 2008\u20132030. \n \n  Sector Investment Plan \nFinancing Plan    Sector   \n  Investment  Investment \n  Plan   Program \n  2008\u20132030  2009\u20132018 \nSource  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nWater Supply Infrastructure  950  150.0  16 \nWastewater Management Infrastructure  980  150.0  15 \nSolid Waste Management   250  40.0  16 \nInstitutional Reform and Development  95  60.0  63 \n  Total  2,275  400.0  18 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nInvestment Program Financing Plan \n  Investment \n  Program  Tranche 1 \nSource  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  300.0  75  38.0  76 \nGovernment  100.0  25  12.0  24 \n  Total  400.0  100  50.0  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "iv   \nThe Investment Program is divided into five tranches, with tranche 1 \ncovering eight subprojects.

Each \nloan will be extended to finance projects subject to submission of \nrelated periodic financing requests (PFR) by the Government. The \nGovernment intends to finance the Program by submitting five PFRs. \nThe first PFR amount is $38 million. The last loan is expected to be \nutilized no later than 31 December 2018.   \n \nThe OCR loans will have an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum, and other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements as applicable. Each loan will be for \na 24-year term, including a grace period of 4 years. The Special \nFunds resources under tranche 1 will have a 32-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nThe Government has options to choose between eligible currencies \nand the interest rate regime most suitable for each loan. ADB also \nprovides flexibility in terms of repayment and interest swaps during \nthe financing period. Repayment schedules can be structured for \neach loan to match the needs of each batch of subprojects with \nregard to their cost-recovery and sustainability profiles. \n \nThe  Government  will  onlend  to  GOS  at  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those for ADB loans to the Government. GOS will bear \nthe foreign exchange risk for all loans.  \n \nFinancing may be made available provided the Investment Program \nis implemented in accordance with the general understandings and \nexpectations upon which the MFF is based, as laid out in the FFA. \nProgress toward the expected outcomes and set out in the design \n ", "  v\nand monitoring framework and the action plan for reform will be part \nof the decision-making criteria and filters for continuing ADB support. \nCompliance  with  the  safeguard  requirements  and  social \ndevelopment policies, and with all other undertakings set forth in the \nFFA  will  also  guide  ADB\u2019s  decision  to  continue  financing  under \nindividual tranches. \n \nPeriod of  Until  31  December  2018  (with  the  last  PFR  submission  by  31 \nUtilization  December 2016) \n \nEstimated   30 June 2018 \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  The Planning and Development Department (P&DD) of the GOS \n \nImplementation  Program Support Unit (PSU) has been established to support overall \nArrangements  Investment Program implementation; the PSU will promote urban \n  reforms and roll-out the USC model to town clusters, beginning with \nthe North Sindh Urban Services Corporation (NSUSC).

An urban policy and strategic planning unit (the urban unit) \nwill be established to provide urban planning and policy support for \nurban development in Sindh. The urban unit will collaborate with the \nPSU to champion reforms and roll-out the USC model to new town \nclusters.  A  Program  Steering  Committee  (PSC),  chaired  by \nadditional chief secretary (development), will provide policy direction \nand strategic oversight.  \n \nUSCs  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  subprojects  and \nmanaging services delivery within their coverage areas. Each USC \nwill be headed by a managing director and professional management \nteam to be recruited competitively from the open market.

In its medium-term development framework (2005\u20132010), the Government of Pakistan  \nhas committed to making towns and cities more efficient and competitive to help accelerate \nnational growth and productivity. The Government cites need for enhanced urban planning and \nmanagement  capabilities,  stronger  public-private  partnerships,  and  integrated  urban \ndevelopment. This includes balanced development and improving basic urban services across \nlarge, medium, and small cities to enhance their productivity and competitiveness, as well as to \nimprove quality of life for their citizens. The Government has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to help finance a part of a strategic and phased investment program targeting urban \nrevitalization in second-tier towns of interior Sindh.1 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Sindh  is  the  second  most  populous  province  in  Pakistan.  It  is  becoming  highly \nurbanized, with nearly half of its population (some 19 million) living in urban areas. While the \nvast majority of this urban population (about 70%) lives in Karachi or Hyderabad, many of the \nnearly 6 million people scattered across Sindh live in more than 20 secondary cities with urban \npopulations exceeding 50,000. Economic growth in these secondary cities lags that of Karachi \nand cities in Punjab. When provincial figures are adjusted for Karachi, the relative stagnation in \neconomic growth in Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities is clear. While the annual per capita income in \nKarachi is about $2,000, the figure for secondary cities in Sindh hovers around $200. That is far \nbelow the national average of $925 per annum. Barriers to economic growth include, among \nothers, poor water and power supplies, inadequate connectivity to Karachi, insufficient skilled \nlabor, and political uncertainty. The implications for income generation and poverty levels are \npronounced. In the absence of economic opportunity, reliable urban services, and a safe, \nsecure, and predictable business environment, these secondary cities will continue to lose their \nyouth to Karachi and fall behind their peer cities in Punjab.2   \n \n4.  Poverty Indicators. Income poverty in Pakistan declined between 2001 and 2005 owing \nto  strong  provincial  economic  growth  and  increased  pro-poor  government  spending.  The \npoverty headcount ratio declined from 34.5% in FY2001 to 23.9% in FY2005, then to 22.3% in \nFY2006.3 A large portion of the population remains vulnerable, however, and the income and \nexpenditure gaps between the poor and wealthier strata (and especially the urban rich) have \nwidened. While urban Sindh is the least deprived area nationally, this is largely due to the \npredominant affect of Karachi. One fourth of Sindh\u2019s urban areas fall into the category of high \ndeprivation, which is indicative of the development gap between Karachi and Sindh\u2019s secondary \ntowns. Urban poverty in Sindh is multifaceted, ranging from deficiencies in basic urban services \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila (TA 4534-PAK, approved on 23 December 2004, supported program preparation).  \n2  Hyderabad and Sukkur rank among the least attractive places to do business in Pakistan based on recent business \nclimate surveys. \n3  Ministry of Finance. 2007. Pakistan Economic Survey 2007\u20132008. Islamabad. \n ", "2   \nto unemployment. The poverty levels of participating towns range from 40% to 50%.4 Significant \ndisparities exist between more developed neighborhoods and the katchi abadis (or slum areas).   \n \n5.  National  and  Provincial-Level  Urban  Service  Performance.  Effective  urban \ninfrastructure and services are prerequisites for sustainable economic growth, yet Pakistan\u2019s \nurban  sector  performance  indicators  have  stagnated  on  the  whole.  Urban  water  supply \ncoverage increased by only 1% during 2000 to 2004, after remaining at 95% nationwide over \nthe prior decade. The number of household connections to piped water decreased from 60% in \n1990 to 49% in 2004, reflecting both population growth and apparent flagging performance of \ngovernment-managed water utilities. While access to improved sanitation rose in Pakistan\u2019s \nurban areas from 82% in 1990 to 92% in 2004, the proportion of households having sewerage \nconnections declined from 45% to 40% over this same period. Solid waste management (SWM) \nservices lag as well. Only 57% of urban households have access to garbage collection systems. \nUrban service delivery performance in interior Sindh compares poorly against these national \nindicators  and,  together  with  environmental  conditions,  is  deteriorating  (para.  7).  Again, \nprovincial figures can be misleading, as relatively better conditions in Karachi mask poorer \nperformance in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns.   \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Appendix 2 presents a problem tree analysis. The core problem is poor service delivery, \nparticularly  poor  quality,  continuity,  and  coverage  of  drinking  water,  sanitation,  and  SWM \nservices. Ineffective institutional arrangements, distorted incentives, weak accountability, and \npoor governance are causal factors. Aggravating the problems are a limited appreciation for \nurbanization and its importance for economic growth and weak incentives to plan. Together, \nthese contribute to widening gaps between the quality of life in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns and \nthat in Karachi and between Sindh and the faster growing areas of Punjab. The sector road map \nand action plan for reform and investment in Appendix 3 elaborate on the challenges and \nopportunities. \n \n1.  Inadequate Services \n \n7.  Water Supply, Wastewater, and SWM. Urban services in Sindh\u2019s secondary cities fall \nshort against three basic targets of quality, continuity, and coverage. On average, about half of \nthe urban population in Sindh Provice outside Karachi has access to piped water, but the water \nis of poor quality and flows intermittently for only 2\u20134 hours a day. Water tariffs and collection \nefficiency are low, and limited data suggests cost recovery is minimal. Arsenic contamination is \npresent at an alarming level in Sindh\u2019s groundwater aquifer.5 Systems are so deficient that there \nis no reliable measure of how much water is sourced or delivered and the costs entailed. \nAccess to sewerage and sanitary drainage (primarily open drains) varies significantly between \ntowns, but averages around 60%.6 Sanitary drainage is extremely limited; sewer lines are often \nblocked,  causing  hazardous  ponding  of  sewage  in  neighborhoods.  There  is  no  sewage \ntreatment in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns. SWM systems are generally nonexistent or rudimentary \nin  urban  centers  outside  Karachi. Less  than 40%  of  the  population  is served  by  garbage \ncollection systems, including some handled by small private operators. No sanitary landfills \nexist; solid waste collected is disposed of by burning or illegal dumping into open spaces or the \n                                                 \n4  The poverty level is measured as PRs749 per person per month (Sindh Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2003).   \n5  Among northern Sindh towns, a UNICEF survey has found alarming rates in Khairpur District. Arsenic is also \npresent in Shikarpur, which has no piped system and relies on groundwater for supply. \n6  Case studies of seven towns across Sindh under the TA for Preparing the Sindh Basic Urban Services Project \nfound less than 10% of the population is served by underground drains. \n ", "  3\ndrainage  channels.  This  causes  pollution  and  blocks  the  wastewater  disposal  network, \nexacerbating sanitation problems. \n \n2.  Weak Institutions, Incentives, Management, Accountability, and Planning \n8.  Ineffective Institutions. The absence of appropriate institutions for urban management \nand  service  delivery  at  taluka  municipal  administration7 (TMA)  level  are  among  the  core \nproblems underlying urban service delivery and the deterioration of infrastructure in Sindh\u2019s \nsecondary towns. Devolution reforms in 2001 transferred political and administrative powers \nover  various  services  to  elected  local  authorities,  but  financing,  skilled  management  and \nstaffing, and accountability mechanisms did not follow. The TMA structure in so-called \u201ccommon \ndistricts\u201d does not lend itself to the professionalized management of modern urban utilities for \nlarger towns.8 A thin layer of four managerial staff is tasked with overseeing TMA responsibilities \nin both rural and urban areas. These four positions are frequently vacant or under-filled with \njunior staff.9 The further absence of mid-level, skilled staff means that front line service delivery \nis left largely to levels 1\u20133 staff, with limited supervision. These structural weaknesses are \nexacerbated by a 10-year hiring ban and the inherent weaknesses of the civil service systems to \nattract,  retain,  and  incentivize  staff  with  specific  technical  skills.  Outside  Karachi  and \nHyderabad, there are no systems for monitoring water quality, no maps of existing water supply \nand wastewater infrastructure, no meters to measure quantities of water produced, no accurate \naccounting of service delivery costs, or even an accurate count of houses connected. \n \n9.  Disconnect between Infrastructure Construction and System Management. Sindh \nProvince  is  littered  with  nonfunctioning  or  partly  operational,  inappropriately  designed  or \nredundant water supply schemes.10 Government investment levels have increased in recent \nyears, and a steady stream of funding for infrastructure and service improvement has flowed to \nsome TMAs through vertical programs, mostly implemented by the provincial-level Public Health \nEngineering Department (PHED),  previously a wing of the local government department.11 \nHowever, these assets have not improved service delivery due to (i) inappropriate projects \nselection, (ii) inappropriate designs, and (iii) insufficient attention to operation and maintenance \nrequirements. The current system, whereby the PHED constructs infrastructure to be handed \nover  to  and  maintained  by  the  TMAs,  incentivizes  scheme  construction  and  not  service \nprovision. It has contributed to a culture of disregard for customer needs and disinterest in \noperational imperatives, including cost measurement and recovery, asset inventorying, and \nsystems mapping. There is, as a result, little transparency or accountability in service delivery.   \n \n10.  Weak Financial Management and Incentives for Cost Recovery. At province level, \npolicy frameworks are not well established. Lack of political commitment for cost recovery \nundermines  financial  sustainability.  Low  tariffs  and  poor  collection  efficiencies  for  urban \nservices, in turn, reflect the poor quality of service offered and poor financial management of \nservice providers. User charges must be increased and collection efficiencies improved for \nsustainable services. However, increases must follow visible improvements in service quality.  \n                                                 \n7  A taluka is a unit of local government that covers several towns and villages. Karachi is the only so-called \u201ccity \ndistrict\u201d government in Sindh. All other municipalities are organized as taluka municipal administrations (TMAs) \nwithin  \u201ccommon  districts.\u201d  Under  the  Sindh  Local  Government  Ordinance,  these  TMAs  are  responsible  for \nmunicipal services and regulations. Municipal services include water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and drainage \nsystems.  \n8 Owing to their smaller size, none of the secondary towns in Sindh have water authorities or boards. \n9  A review of TMA staff in 2007 found that over 90% of finance officer positions (level 17) were either vacant or \nunderfilled with grade 11 accounts officers; some 40% of the infrastructure and services positions were vacant. The \nfifth budgeted position, the planning officer, has never been filled in any TMA owing to staffing constraints. \n10 Ironically, these schemes often sit alongside still functional infrastructure built decades or even a century ago.  \n11 In May 2008 the Public Health Engineering Wing was reorganized as a Department in Sindh Province. \n ", "4   \n11.  Public trust in service providers must be rebuilt. Entire towns, such as Larkana and \nShikarpur, have opted out of public piped-water supply systems development, preferring far less \nefficient, but more reliable, self-provision from household pumping schemes. Cost recovery \nagainst operations and maintenance for water supply varies (but is typically below 30%) and it is \nfar lower for wastewater management. The difference has to be made up through a government \nsubsidy. The exact size of this subsidy is difficult to determine, given the absence of data on \nwhat  it  costs  to  provide  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services.  Local  government \nofficials find it difficult to increase (or even to set) tariffs, and direct involvement of taluka nazims \nin service provision inevitably leads to undercharging.12 There is neither bulk nor individual \nmetering in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns. User fees are typically charged at a flat rate. There is no \ncalculation of tariff rates necessary to cover cash operating costs, operations, and maintenance, \nand eventually debt service, depreciation, and a share of future capital expenditure.  \n \n12.  Poor Planning and Weak Appreciation for Urbanization as a Force for Economic \nGrowth. These problems are compounded by the inadequate urban planning systems, which \nhave  resulted  in  haphazard  and  unplanned  growth  in  town  areas.  While  urban  planning \nfunctions have been devolved to the TMAs, no planning staff has been assigned and TMAs are \nunable  to  generate  the  vision,  strategies,  plans,  and  associated  actions  to  stimulate  and \nmanage effective urban growth and thus support economic development and improved quality \nof life. At province level, there has been too little focus on the role of urbanization in supporting \neconomic growth, job creation, and reduced regional disparities. A provincial focal point for \nstrategizing and planning urban regeneration is needed. \n \nC.  Prior External Assistance and Lessons \n \n13.  External Assistance. ADB assistance to water supply and sanitation (WSS) and other \nurban development in Pakistan to date totals over $1.2 billion across 16 projects and about 30 \nTA projects. However, this program will be the first major assistance for secondary towns in \nSindh Province since the $22 million loan for the Hyderabad Water Supply and Sewerage \nProject13 approved in 1976. It follows other ADB support for WSS and the urban sector in \nPunjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Karachi (generally implemented with mixed results). \nThe Investment Program complements ongoing and proposed support to Karachi and responds \nto a Government of Sindh (GOS) commitment to regionally balanced development. \n \n14.  Other development partners assisting Pakistan\u2019s urban sector include the World Bank; \nthe  governments  of  Japan,  Kuwait,  Netherlands,  and  United  Kingdom;  United  Nations \norganizations; and the World Bank\u2019s multipartner Water and Sanitation Program (WSP). While \neach has tended to focus on particular cities or provinces, the Investment Program\u2019s design has \nbenefited  from  information-sharing  with  the  World  Bank,  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom initiatives in Punjab Province, and WSP initiatives in North-\nWest Frontier Province. Within Sindh, Japan International Cooperation Agency is providing \nadvisory services and/or finance to improve water supply, sewerage, and transport, including a \nmaster plan for water supply and sewerage in Karachi. WSP has supported WSS reforms and \nbenchmarking, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have province-wide sanitation programs (although focused \nprimarily  on  rural  communities),  and  USAID\u2019s  Districts  that  Work  Program  proposes \n                                                 \n12 Taluka nazims (which are chief elected local officials) in North Sindh recognize this problem and want to distance \ntheir offices from direct provision. \n13 ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department assessed this project \u201cpartly successful\u201d after significant reductions in \nscope and protracted delays. \n ", "  5\ninfrastructure  support  for  select  TMAs  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.14   Appendix  4  lists \ndevelopment partner assistance to the urban sector since 2000. \n \n15.  Lessons  Observed  and  Incorporated. The  Investment  Program design takes into \naccount lessons from previous ADB loans, other donor interventions, and the Government\u2019s \nown programs.15 The Operations Evaluation Department has assessed ADB\u2019s urban sector \nlending as weak, citing limited ability to \u201cturn physical outputs into outcomes.\u201d Contributing \nfactors cited include (i) financial and management weakness of urban authorities; (ii) poor \nsequencing of infrastructure and institutional reforms, the former typically preceding the latter; \n(iii) insufficient attention to distortions from rent-seeking behavior; and (iv) too little innovation \nand private sector participation.16 The Investment Program design directly addresses these \nissues by providing a given TMA a sound alternative to professionally manage urban services \ndelivery through a jointly held company. The new company will help to ring-fence finances, \nmaintain higher standards for corporate governance and transparency, and access private \nsector expertise. Fully consistent with these lessons, the Investment Program goes beyond \ninstitutional strengthening components to ensure the key institutional reform is in place upfront.   \n \n16.  The  Investment  Program  also  addresses  these  issues  by  (i)  adopting  a  phased \napproach under an MFF, allowing time for reform to take root and roll out to new areas; (ii) \nputting  institutional  reforms  in  advance  of  infrastructure,  thus  better  aligning  incentives  to \nservice delivery results; (iii) targeting a small number of priority secondary towns, geographically \nclustered and agreed to collaborate through a single implementing agency, the jointly held \ncorporate utility; (iv) focusing on only two urban subsectors; (v) targeting quick wins through a \nfew tranche 1 demonstration subprojects; and (vi) avoiding the institutional imperative to be all \nthings to all people.17 Supplementary Appendix B elaborates on lessons learned. \n \nD.  Rationale \n \n17.  Rationale for Investment Program. Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities are under increasing \nstress of population growth and continuing urban poverty. Provision of urban infrastructure and \nservices has not kept pace with this population growth. Inadequate planning and infrastructure \nservices management keep costs high and quality low while impeding these towns\u2019 economic \ncompetitiveness. Insufficient and unreliable urban services (i) add to business and household \ncosts, (ii) damage the urban environment and diminish the quality of life, and (iii) decrease the \nattractiveness of these cities to potential investment (thus contributing to a downward spiral of \ndevelopment). The poor performance of local governments in delivering services also reduces \ntheir credibility and adversely affects their ability to perform other municipal functions. \n \n18.  The devolution reforms of 2001 transferred political and administrative power to elected \nlocal authorities and provided an opportunity for more effective service provision. Nevertheless, \nservice  delivery  improvements  are  hindered  by  continuing  overlaps  and  fragmentation  of \n                                                 \n14 Such  investment  supported  by  development  partners  poses  challenges  for  establishing  urban  services \ncorporations. These development partner-supported vertical programs also need to be brought under the planning \nand implementation umbrella of the service provider.    \n15 GOS has cited local government department review that found about 700 of over 1,000 Public Health Engineering-\nconstructed schemes to be inoperable, owing primarily to operations and maintenance problems or TMA refusal to \naccept the schemes.   \n16 ADB. 2005. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation for the Social Sectors in Pakistan. Manila. \n17 As an example, the imperative for hygiene education is clear. Evidence shows that hand washing with soap can \nreduce diarrhea risk by nearly 50%, and hygiene promotion may be the single most cost-effective means of \npreventing disease in developing countries. Rather than appending a hygiene education component and adding \nunnecessary complexity, the Investment Program will focus on service delivery but seek parallel financing with \npartners specializing in hygiene promotion in schools. \n ", "6   \nresponsibilities between the TMAs and provincial-level agencies. In some urban areas, local \ngovernment  management  has  been  weakened  since  devolution.  Alternative  approaches  to \nservice provision, including infrastructure planning and construction, are needed to address the \nchallenges  facing  Sindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities.  Service  delivery  needs  to  be  separated  from \nsystem regulation and political interest. Service provision needs to be progressively placed on a \ncommercial  and  self-sustaining  basis,  leveraging  private  sector  expertise  and  incentive \nstructures as appropriate.   \n \n19.  SCIP is a 10-year, $400 million program under a $300 million ADB-financed MFF to \nfinance  basic  urban  infrastructure  improvements  in  Sindh\u2019s  secondary  towns  through  (i) \nestablishment of local government-owned, professionally managed urban services corporations \n(USCs);  (ii)  support  for  urban  sector  reforms  and  capacity  development;  and  (iii)  priority \ninvestment  in  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  infrastructure.  The \nInvestment Program offers so-called \u201cclusters\u201d of local governments a new means to organize \nurban services delivery by drawing on a provision of the Sindh Local Government Ordinance \nallowing for TMAs to jointly establish and own a regional utility corporation. This collaborative \napproach targets geographically clustered TMAs and takes advantage of economies of scale by \naggregating TMAs\u2019 shared vision for improved service delivery. Two or three USCs, to be \ndeveloped sequentially under the Investment Program and incorporated under the Companies \nOrdinance 1984, will have (i) professional management, (ii) more efficient administration and \nsound financial management systems, (iii) sound corporate governance, (iv) commitment to cost \nrecovery,  (v)  enhanced  accountability,  and  (vi)  greater  customer  focus.  The  USCs  will  be \nsupported by various agreements and guidelines that clearly establish the roles, responsibilities, \nand obligations of the participating TMAs, the USCs, the provincial government, and other \nstakeholders. A financing mechanism will be established to fund cash shortfalls arising from the \ngap between costs to deliver urban services and what citizens will pay for these services. Over \ntime,  this  gap  should  narrow  as  services  improve,  trust  builds,  and  operating  efficiencies \nincrease.   \n \n20.  Through  these  institutional  reforms,  the  Investment  Program  targets  significant \nimprovements in service delivery, beginning with demonstration areas aimed at restoring trust in \npiped-water services with 24/7 delivery of potable water. Across participating towns, better \nservice providers should bring significantly improved quality and quantity of piped-water access, \nfar higher levels of wastewater treatment, and systematic collection and proper final disposal of \nsolid waste to break the cycle of trash that clogs drains and leads to flooded communities. The \npresent state of operations and service data makes setting service standards and performance \ntargets  difficult.  However,  under  the  Investment  Program,  generating  baseline  data  and \nmapping  existing  systems  will  be  a  priority  to  enable  optimum  investment  and  informed \noperational decisions. As information becomes available, performance targets will be agreed \nbetween the USCs and TMAs, documented in service agreements, linked to tariff and financing \nrequirements,  and  monitored  through  benchmarking  exercises.  Higher  standards  for \naccountability, transparency, and financial efficiency are expected, and nonperformance in this \nregard will be defined as failure. \n \n21.  Selection  of  MFF  Modality.  The  MFF  modality  was  selected,  as  it  sets  a  solid \nfoundation for long-term partnership between ADB and GOS to revitalize Sindh\u2019s second-tier \ncities.  The  modality  is  well  suited  to  the  Investment  Program  as  it  avoids  the  piecemeal \napproach of past urban sector projects and establishes a sufficiently broad platform to engage \nsubstantively  with  GOS  on  fundamental  reforms.  It  allows  for  (i)  logical  sequencing  of \ninterrelated physical, and nonphysical investments over a 10-year period to support GOS\u2019 long-\nterm objectives for balanced urban development; (ii) sequencing of significant public sector and \nurban service reform initiatives that require actions over a period of years; (iii) phasing of \n ", "  7\ninvestments to support subprojects in new \u201ctown clusters\u201d as they organize USCs; (iv) flexibility \nin levels of investment, with tranche amounts increasing over time as reforms take hold, the \ncorporate model is adopted, and geographical coverage increases; (v) flexibility in timing of \nreforms against a road map for priority policy actions while ensuring the pace of infrastructure \ninvestment incentivizes institutional change; (vi) testing of new ideas and application of this \nexperience to other town clusters during subsequent phases, thus enhancing implementation \nefficiency;  (vii)  expedited  implementation  should  reforms  and  loan  disbursements  proceed \nahead of plan; and (viii) financing on an as-needed basis to reduce transaction costs. Finally, \nthe MMF modality also complements ADB\u2019s proposed investment support to Karachi, thus \nproviding a more balanced approach to province-wide urban development in Sindh. \n \n22.  Sector Road Map and Investment Program. A set of institutional and financial reform \nactions, sequenced with targeted consultancy and priority subproject investments, are required \nfor this step-change in urban strategy and planning at provincial level and in services delivery at \nlocal level (Appendix 3). Under the Investment Program, GOS has agreed with ADB on a road \nmap of practical, well-sequenced steps to bring about institutional, operational, financial, and \nregulatory  reforms  and  service  orientation  reforms  to  ensure  a  receptive  environment  for \ninfrastructure investment.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The impact of the Investment Program will be improved health and quality of life for an \nestimated 4,000,000 residents in the participating secondary18 towns in Sindh and improved \neconomic competitiveness of those towns. The outcome of the Investment Program will be \nenhanced quality, coverage, and reliability of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services for \nan estimated 570,000 households in the participating towns. \n \nB.  Outputs \n24.  To achieve these outcomes, the Investment Program will support a comprehensive \nreform program that includes introducing more effective urban planning, well managed and \nfinancially sustainable urban service providers, and increased private sector participation. These \nreforms will be complemented by priority investments in water supply, wastewater, and SWM \nimprovements.  The  Investment  Program  comprises  four  parts.  Part  A  supports  the \nestablishment  of  professionalized  urban  service  providers,  urban  planning  capacity,  and \ntechnical  backstopping  for  program  implementation.  Parts  B  and  C  will  finance  targeted \ninfrastructure improvements in water supply and wastewater and in SWM, respectively. Part D \nprovides revenue shortfall support for the newly established USCs. Parts B, C, and D are \ndesigned to complement the institutional development and reforms aimed at improving service \ndelivery. Appendix 5 details these physical and non-physical outputs planned under Tranche 1. \n \n25.  The core reform under the Investment Program is the delegated management of water \nsupply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services  to  professional  management  under  contractual \nagreements. Starting in northern Sindh, the Investment Program will support formation and \noperationalization of USCs (each jointly established under the Companies Ordinance 1984 by a \ncluster of TMAs) to deliver these services to specified coverage areas comprising the former \nurban local council areas. Service provision will be delegated to three USCs by clusters of \nTMAs  through  service  and  asset  management  agreements  (SAMAs)  that  clearly  define \n                                                 \n18 Secondary towns for purposes of the Investment Program refers to those towns with populations between 50,000 \nand 1 million.   \n ", "8   \nrespective roles and responsibilities while specifying service targets, standards, and agreed \ninvestment and service charge levels. The USCs will be accountable to their respective boards \n(which will include some TMA representatives) for their performance as autonomous entities \nwith a focus on performance and customer service. NSUSC has been incorporated to serve the \nfirst cluster of six TMAs comprising Khairpur, Larkana, New Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, and \nSukkur.19 Associated service agreements have been drafted and are under negotiation. The \nInvestment Program will support these actions and arrangements in NSUSC and future USCs, \nincluding to engage the necessary management expertise. \n \n1.  Part  A:  Urban  Planning  on  Institutional  Development,  and  Program \nImplementation Support    \n26.  Part A will provide technical and management support to the program support unit (PSU) \nand  the  urban  policy  and  strategic  planning  unit  (the  urban  unit),  two  separate  but \ncomplementary units in the Sindh Planning and Development Department (P&DD). The PSU is \ntasked with the Investment Program\u2019s execution and specific reform activities. The urban unit \nwill provide overall guidance on urban policy and planning plus province-wide reforms to support \nmore effective urbanization. Part A will provide support to the PSU for (i) executing the reform \nagenda under the program, including rolling out the regional USC concept to other city clusters; \n(ii) subproject appraisal and support on safeguards; and (iii) monitoring and evaluating the \nInvestment Program. Support will be provided under part A to the urban unit for urban policy, \nstrategic regional and town planning, and information systems. As a focal point for SCIP-related \nreforms, the PSU will support the TMAs in adjusting to their new role as shareholders of the \nUSCs and parties to the SAMAs. Through the PSU and urban unit, the SCIP will support the \nTMAs to monitor USCs and develop town planning capacity. \n \n27.  Technical  and  management  support  will  be  provided  to  the  USCs  in  planning, \noperational  systems,  investment  programming  and  budgeting,  and  system  operation  and \nmaintenance. This will include developing business plans to set out how the USCs will meet \ntheir obligations under the SAMAs and to be used as a basis for the release of Investment \nProgram funds. Consultancy support will also be provided to the USCs and their capital works \nunits for the Investment Program\u2019s implementation, including design and such contract-related \nmatters as document preparation, procurement packaging, tendering, awarding, and contract \nsupervision. Assistance will be provided to the USCs to facilitate private sector participation \nthrough performance-based management contracts for water and waste management services.  \nPart A will also include (i) provision of computers, office equipment, and vehicles for the PSU, \nurban  unit,  and  USCs  to  support  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  execution  and  subsequent \noperations;  and  (ii)  training  for  the  PSU,  urban  unit,  TMAs,  and  USCs  in  a  range  of \nadministrative, management, and technical aspects of strategic planning, service planning, and \noperations.  \n \n28.  Tranche  1  and  Subsequent  Tranches.   Part A financing for non-physical outputs  \nunder tranche 1 focuses on the operationalization of the PSU and NSUSC, establishment of the \nurban unit, and building a strong platform from which to implement the reform program and \ninfrastructure works.  Under subsequent tranches, part A financing will continue to support the \nPSU, urban unit and USCs, with more emphasis on capacity development for the new USCs.  \nInvestment in capacity development at provincial and USC levels under the early tranches \nshould enable the proportion of financing under part A to reduce overtime. \n                                                 \n19 Factors influencing the selection of urban areas in these TMAs included population (Sukkur and Larkana are the \nthird and fourth largest towns in Sindh), proximity to one another (all within 90-minute drive), strategic location \nalong the National Trade Corridor, receptive political leadership, and willingness to cooperate together and improve \nurban service delivery systems. \n ", "  9\n \n2.  Part B: Water Supply and Wastewater Management Improvements \n   \n29.  Part B will be implemented by the USCs and focuses on water supply and wastewater \nmanagement,  including  system  mapping  and  planning;  source  identification,  development, \nimprovement, and augmentation; raw water transmission, storage, and treatment; treatment \nplant rehabilitation; treated water storage, transmission, and distribution; distribution network \nand service connection improvement; leak detection and reduction; bulk and individual water \nmetering;  water  quality  monitoring;  drainage  and  sewerage  network  improvements;  and \nwastewater treatment plant rehabilitation and construction.  \n \n30.  Tranche 1. Under the first tranche, part B finances physical investments in (i) water \nsupply system augmentation and rehabilitation (source development, treatment, storage, and \ntransmission) in the TMAs of Khairpur, New Sukkur, Rohri, and Sukkur; (ii) pilot distribution \nnetwork improvement (DNI) schemes in specific urban council areas in Khairpur, New Sukkur, \nRohri,  and  Sukkur;  (iii)  groundwater  monitoring  in  Larkana  and  Shikarpur;  (iv)  urgent \nimprovements to wastewater management systems in Khairpur and Rohri; and (v) small-scale \ninvestments in drainage and sewerage networks and associated facilities through an allocation \nof loan funds for wastewater improvement works in tranche 1 cluster towns, subject to selection \ncriteria in the FFA. \n \n31.  Subsequent Tranches 2\u20135. Under the subsequent tranches, part B will finance physical \ninvestments  in  similar  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  including  more  comprehensive \ninvestment in wastewater works. Subsequent investments will be guided by further mapping and \nplanning work under tranche 1.  Tranche 2 investments will focus on expanding investment and \nconsolidating reforms in northern Sindh towns, before shifting to new town clusters and USCs \nunder tranches 3\u20135.  Nawabshah and Mirpurkhas are the most likely anchor towns for future \ntown clusters in mid and south Sindh. \n \n3.  Part C: Solid Waste Management Improvements  \n32.  Part C will also be implemented by USCs and focuses on SWM, including investments in \nprimary and secondary storage and collection, waste reduction, recycling, reuse and recovery \n(including incineration where appropriate), treatment, and final sanitary disposal.  \n \n33.  Tranche  1.    Under  the  first  tranche,  part  C  finances  physical  investments  in  (i) \nconstruction of four landfill facilities in Khairpur, Larkana, and Shikarpur, with a common facility \nin Rohri serving New Sukkur, Rohri, and Sukkur; (ii) procurement of specialized solid waste \ncollection and disposal equipment; and (iii) provision of improved communal bins for waste \nstorage.  \n \n34.  Subsequent Tranches 2\u20135.  Under the subsequent tranches, part C will finance similar \ninvestments in collection, final disposal and management of solid waste.  During the second \ntranche,  NSUSC  will  expand  its  coverage  to  other  north  Sindh  towns,  with  investment  in \nadditional sanitary landfills and collection systems. Subsequent tranches will build on the results \nof tranche 1, particularly the introduction of private sector participation in SWM.  \n \n4.  Part D: Operational and Transition Support Funding  \n35.  Part D provides financing for (i) operational support funding intended to bridge the short-\nto-medium term operational cash shortfalls of the USCs with GOS grant funds, and (ii) transition \nsupport funding to bridge the short-term operational cash shortfalls of the USCs with GOS loan \n ", "10   \nfunds.  The  choice  of  mix  between  grant  and  loan  funding  for  the  USCs  will  be  at  GOS\u2019 \ndiscretion.20  \n \n36.  Tranche 1 and Subsequent Tranches.  The estimated financing requirement under \npart D in tranche 1 is $8 million.  Financing under tranche 2 and subsequent tranches will \ncontinue for NSUSC through FY2017, but in decreasing amounts.  Funding under part D will be \navailable for new USCs, subject to the criteria and agreed operational funding guidelines. \nFunding of about $30 million from part D may be required for operational support of three USCs \nover the Investment Program period. \n \nC.  Special Features \n37.  Establishment of Regional Urban Services Corporations. The Investment Program \nproposes a progressive, two-stage reform process for improving municipal services and taking \nadvantage of economies of scale. As a first step, the participating, geographically clustered \nTMAs would join together to form a corporatized operating utility, a USC, under the Companies \nOrdinance 1984. The USC will aggregate the TMAs\u2019 urban water supply, wastewater, and SWM \noperations into a single corporation to achieve economies of scale and to share the overhead \ncosts of professional management.21 Professional management will be competitively recruited \nfrom the market and tasked to improve service delivery. Incentives will be better aligned with \nperformance objectives, and compensation systems will be designed to reward results. USC \nfinances will be ring-fenced, rigorously audited, and not intermixed with TMA financial accounts, \nthus allowing management to better track service delivery costs and revenues. Under the USC \nmodel, the disconnect between asset creation and asset management will be addressed, as \nexisting system components will be inventoried and their performance assessed before deciding \non where, how much, and when to invest. This institutional reform will help to break the costly \ncycle of asset creation and rapid deterioration. Properly corporatized utilities, governed under an \nindependent board of directors and able to act in accordance with sound commercial principles, \nshould ensure focus on cost recovery to achieve financial sustainability, particularly in water \nsupply. Supplementary Appendix C elaborates on NSUSC organization and legal structure. \n \n38.  Service and Asset Management Agreements. The introduction of SAMAs between \nTMAs and the USCs is at the core of the Investment Program\u2019s institutional reforms. The USCs \nwill enter into SAMAs with each of their participating TMAs to provide water, wastewater, and \nSWM services and manage the relevant TMA assets in their specified urban areas.22 These \npublic-public  service  agreements  would  set  out  performance  indicators  and  reporting \nrequirements, as appropriate given systems data available. Such agreements would help clarify \nroles and responsibilities during the first stage of reform and improve services by focusing \nmanagement and current expenditure on readily achievable improvements to operations and \nmaintenance. These SAMAs will provide the USCs the right to use all assets\u2014infrastructure, \nassociated  land,  and  mobile  plant  and  equipment\u2014as  required  to  deliver  the  contracted \nservices.23 These agreements represent a first step toward better incentivized, performance-\nbased management contracting agreements that assume greater private sector involvement \nunder second-stage reforms. They are the connective tissue that links the various elements \nnecessary for improved service delivery. The SAMAs represent the vehicle by which the USC \nand TMAs agree on a coherent plan for desired operating results that is linked to identified \n                                                 \n20 The appropriate timing and use of loan funding will depend upon urban services\u2019 revenue generating capacity and \ntheir potential to generate surplus funds for debt repayment. \n21 This refers to operations in former urban local councils. \n22 Coverage areas will be former urban local councils. Rural or village-based water and sanitation programs will \nremain under their current management arrangements by TMA staff not deputed to the USCs. \n23 The TMAs will remain the owners of new and existing assets in water supply, wastewater, and SWM.  \n ", "  11\noperating priorities, levels of capital investment, operating budget, and, most important, agreed \nincreases in user charges.  Supplementary Appendix D contains a draft SAMA. \n \n39.  Operational  and  Transition  Support  Funding  Mechanisms.  These  funding \nmechanisms aim to bridge the gap between operational costs and operational revenues in a \nmanner that encourages financial transparency, operational accountability, and fiscal discipline. \nThe mechanisms will help GOS clearly to identify, measure, and, over time, reduce the fiscal \nburden of supporting municipal services delivery. Operational support funding is intended to \nbridge the operational cash shortfalls of USC operations with grant funds when user charges \nare unlikely to be sufficient to repay the funding, as typically is the case of wastewater and SWM \nservices. Transition support funding aims to bridge USCs\u2019 short-term operational cash shortfalls \nwith  loan  funds,  subsequently  to  be  repaid through  USCs\u2019  revenues  from  user  charges.24 \nOperational support funding will be linked to understandings between the TMAs and the USCs \non tariff enhancement.25 The two funding mechanisms will provide GOS a flexible option to \nensure that the investments made through the Investment Program are financially sustainable. \nThis will help USCs to realize the full economic life of their infrastructure, delaying the need for \nasset replacement. At GOS level, the operational support funding will be channeled through an \nescrow  account  arrangement,  guided  by  an  escrow  agreement,  and  overseen  by  an \nindependent verifier26 to ensure timely, predictable, and accountable funding to the USCs. The \nguidelines for the operational and transition support funding are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n40.  Stage-Two  Reforms  and  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  through  Management \nContracts. First-stage reforms will establish the USCs with more professional management and \naccess to skilled staff. It will be a substantial improvement over the typical water and sanitation \nauthority model and will begin service improvement. Over time, however, there will likely be \nincreased pressure to reduce USC autonomy (e.g., pressure to hire unqualified staff or not to \ncollect  user  charges).  This  suggests  that  improvements  in  service  delivery  under  a \ncorporatization model, in some contexts, may only be modest and not sustainable without \nfurther reforms to better align incentives with service delivery. Performance-based management \ncontracts or lease affermage arrangements with qualified private operators are ways to further \nincentivize  results.  Establishment  of  USCs  and  further  advisory  support  on  private  sector \nparticipation under the Investment Program will help pave the way for second-stage reforms, \nincluding introduction of more comprehensive performance-based management contracts in \nSWM and water services and appropriate systems for regulation. Such performance-based \ncontracts will further separate TMAs from day-to-day service provision. This will allow local and \nprovincial governments to shift their focus to regulatory and monitoring functions while private \noperators focus on professional management of water and solid waste operations, including to \nrecover user charges and deliver results against contracted targets.  \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n \n41.  Sector investment needs are estimated at $2.3 billion through 2030. The medium-term \nestimate is at $1.0 billion through 2018, of which the Investment Program provides $400 million \n                                                 \n24 GOS had indicated a preference to provide USCs grant financing at the start. Transition support funding provides \nGOS an option that it may avail itself of as tariff revenues, particularly for water supply, increase to levels that can \nsupport debt repayment. \n25 Such understandings will be included in SAMAs, with principles being (i) tariffs should increase with inflation, (ii) \ntariff increases above the rate of inflation should be linked to improved services, and (iii) average tariffs should \nincrease over time to levels that cover the full costs of operations and maintenance. A Tripartite Operational \nSupport and Capital Investment Financing Agreement among GOS, the USC, and each TMA will guide funding \noperations and complement the SAMAs. This will be a grant agreement under tranche 1. \n26 The independent verifier will be a firm contracted by GOS under part A against agreed criteria.   \n ", "12   \nequivalent (Table 1).

Financing Plan \n42.  To finance the Investment Program, the Government has requested up to $300 million \nequivalent through an MFF, comprising up to $262 million equivalent from ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) and $38 million equivalent from Special Funds resources, in accordance with \nADB policy.27 This represents 75% of the Investment Program\u2019s total cost. The Government will \nprovide counterpart financing to cover (i) remuneration of counterpart staff, (ii) land acquisition, \n(iii)  civil  works,  (iv)  surveys  and  data  gathering,  (v)  taxes  and  duties,  and  (vi)  other \nmiscellaneous costs. The financing plan for the Investment Program is in Table 2. \n \n43.  The Government has also requested ADB to consider providing up to $112 million \nequivalent from its Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources for subsequent tranches. It is \nunderstood that any additional ADF financing will be accompanied by a corresponding reduction \nin the OCR financing available, so that in any event the total available amount under the MFF \nwill not exceed $300 million equivalent. This additional allocation will be subject to (i) the \ngeneral availability of ADF resources, (ii) Pakistan\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to \nADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy  (1998)  and  the  requirements  of  the  ADF  donors,  and  (iii)  the \navailability of such resources to Pakistan pursuant to ADB\u2019s Policy on Performance-Based \nAllocation for Asian Development Fund Resources (2001). \n \n44.  The  MFF  will  consist  of  individual  loans  to  finance  a  range  of  subprojects  and \ncomponents under the Investment Program, subject to the Government\u2019s submitting related \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs) and execution of the related loan and project agreements. \nThe Government and GOS has entered into a framework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB \nand are required to comply with its requirements. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government has \nsubmitted to ADB the first PFR in a total amount of $38 million equivalent from ADF. The \nminimum amount of subsequent PFRs will be $25 million. \n \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. \n ", "  13\n45.  ADB will use its OCR to finance selected subprojects under parts B, C, and D for a \nmaximum  amount  of  $262  million  equivalent.  All  provisions  of  ordinary  loan  regulations \napplicable to ADB\u2019s London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans will apply to each loan, \nsubject to modifications, if any, that may be included under any loan and project agreements. \nEach loan will be for a 24-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, with an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum, as well as such other terms and conditions as agreed in the FFA and loan \nregulations and further supplemented in the legal agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government will relend the proceeds \nof such loans to GOS on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loans.  \n \n46.  Parts A and D; selected water supply, wastewater management, and SWM subprojects \nunder parts B and C; and project design and supervision under all investment subprojects, \namounting to up to $38 million in tranche 1, will be eligible for funding through ADF resources.28 \nIn the event that ADB will provide additional ADF financing as described in para. 43, such \nadditional ADF resources will only be used for eligible expenditures. The Government will make \nthe proceeds of the loan available to GOS upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \nExcept as ADB may otherwise agree, the terms and conditions will include interest at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a repayment period of \n32 years, and a grace period of 8 years. GOS will bear the foreign exchange risk of the OCR \nand ADF loans. The financing plan for the Investment Program and for tranche 1 is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Investment Program  Tranche 1 \nSource   Amount  %  Amount  % \nADB Ordinary Capital Resources  262.0a  65.5  0.0  0.0 \nADB Asian Development Fund    38.0  9.5  38.0  76.0 \nGovernment   100.0  25.0  12.0  24.0 \nTotal  400.0  100.0  50.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  The allocation for ordinary capital resources will be reduced should ADB provide additional Asian Development \nFund financing.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n47.  Financing may be made available provided the Investment Program is implemented in \naccordance with the general understandings and expectations on which the MFF is based, as \nlaid out in the FFA. Progress toward the expected outcomes and set out in the design and \nmonitoring framework and the action plan for reform will be part of the decision-making criteria \nand filters for continuing ADB support. Compliance with the safeguards requirements and social \ndevelopment policies, as well as with all other undertakings set forth in the FFA will also guide \nADB\u2019s decision to continue financing under individual tranches. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Investment Program Management \n48.  P&DD will be the Executing Agency (EA). GOS has established a PSU to support \nimplementation  and  take  overall  responsibility  for  the  Investment  Program  including  to  (i) \n                                                 \n28 Subprojects with priority to be financed by ADF resources include (i) under part B, pilot distribution network \nimprovements  for  water  supply  in  priority  zones  and  wastewater  improvements;  and  (ii)  under  part  C, \nimprovements in primary and secondary solid waste collection and storage.  \n ", "14   \npromote urban and related sector reforms as agreed in the urban sector road map and design \nand monitoring framework; (ii) support rollout of the USC model to new town clusters; (iii) \nassume  responsibility  for  the  preparation  of  the  PFR;  (iv)  facilitate  interdepartmental  and \nprovincial coordination; (v) carry out program monitoring and evaluation through the investment \nprogram performance monitoring system (IPPMS); (vi) prepare quarterly and annual progress \nreports; (vii) ensure the quality of social and environmental safeguards documentation prepared \nby the implementing agencies; and (viii) engage an independent verifier29 to assess USC and \nTMA compliance with Investment Program-related agreements. P&DD will also establish an \nurban unit within 6 months of the effectiveness of the first tranche. The urban unit will provide \nstrategic urban planning and policy support for urban development in Sindh. In the context of \nthe Investment Program, the PSU and urban unit will work together as change managers, \nsupporting rollout of the USC model to new town clusters. Implementation arrangements are \ndiagrammed  in  Appendix  7.  The  design  of  program  management,  capacity  building,  and \nimplementation support is described in Appendix 8. The EA will establish one or more regional \noffices as needed to support Investment Program implementation and facilitate TMA interaction \nwith the USCs. \n \n49.  The SCIP\u2019s program director, the PSU head,30 and the head of the urban unit will be \nrecruited by P&DD through competitive processes acceptable to ADB and criteria mutually \nagreed between GOS and ADB. The urban unit head recruitment process will be open to \ngovernment and market applicants. The PSU and urban unit heads will be supported by highly \nqualified professional and support staff recruited through competitive processes acceptable to \nADB, and against criteria mutually agreed between Sindh and ADB.31 The PSU staff will include \nspecialists  in  municipal  services  engineering,  municipal  finance,  program  implementation, \nprocurement, monitoring and evaluation, urban development, and information technology. The \nurban unit staff will include specialists in urban policy and economics, regional and urban \nplanning, statistics and mapping, and information technology. The SCIP program director will be \nresponsible  to  ensure  that  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  implementation  is  consistent  with  its \nenvironmental and social safeguards frameworks.  \n \n50.  The PSC will provide policy direction and strategic oversight and serve as a focal point \nfor  interagency  coordination  on  Investment  Program-related  matters.  PSU  will  include \nrepresentatives from provincial government, district government, participating TMAs and from \ncivil society. The chairperson may invite other persons, as necessary, to attend PSC meetings. \nThe PSC will meet at least quarterly. The PSC will, among other responsibilities, (i) advise on \nkey sector reform milestones, (ii) review annual and quarterly performance reports on reform \nand implementation progress of the Investment Program, and (iii) advise on or make policy-level \ndecisions required to facilitate timely program execution.  \n \n51.  The EA will also facilitate establishment of the USCs to be incorporated under the \nCompanies Ordinance 1984, with all participating TMAs as shareholders comprising the general \nbody of the corporation.32 Each USC will have a board of directors which will include (i) the \ntaluka  nazims  of  the  TMAs  forming  the  shareholders  of  the  corporation;  (ii)  provincial \ngovernment representation comprising the SCIP program director; a representative from the \nprovincial finance department; and district coordination officers; (iii) the managing director of the \n                                                 \n29 Findings of the independent verifier will be provided simultaneously to GOS, NSUSC, and ADB, and they will be \nmade public on the NSUSC website. \n30 The existing PSU head, the SCIP program director, was selected through such a competitive process. Successors, \nif any, will be similarly recruited. \n31 The staff for each unit will comprise five full-time specialists under loan financing, and three to four incremental \nstaff from GOS. \n32 Each USC will be established prior to loan negotiations for any tranche intended to finance its operations or \ninvestments. \n ", "  15\nUSC; and (iv) at least 35% of the total Board members will be independent directors, selected \nagainst agreed skills-based criteria and in accordance with a process acceptable to ADB. The \nindependent directors will include representatives from the business community, and at least \none third will be women.33 The managing director of the USC will have experience managing \nservice delivery and other relevant qualifications to be agreed upon between ADB, and GOS. \nThe USC managing director will be recruited from the open market and on a competitive basis \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n52.  The USC will be responsible for the day-to-day management of urban services provision, \nincluding on-the-job training of deputed TMA staff in utility operations, and will implement all \nwater  supply,  sanitation,  and  SWM  construction  and  rehabilitation  work,  including  the \nsubprojects, in the coverage areas. The USC will also (i) be responsible for the procurement \nprocess,  including  the  award  and  implementation  of  contracts  related  to  water  supply, \nsanitation, and SWM subprojects; (ii) prepare annual plans and budgets for submission to its \nboard; (iii) provide immediate oversight for environmental and social safeguards related to the \nsubprojects;  and  (iv)  prepare  periodic  financing  requests  with  respect  to  the  relevant \nsubprojects.   \n \n53.  P&DD,  through  the  PSU,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program\u2019s  support  for  spatial  and  town  planning  and  capacity  building  for \nparticipating TMAs while working in close collaboration with the regional office(s) at TMA-level, \nthe local government department, and the urban unit. \n \n54.  P&DD will be responsible for establishing the operational and transition support funding \nmechanisms. These funds will be operated as separate escrow accounts in which ADB loan \nproceeds and GOS contributions will be deposited in advance for each financial year. Since \nthese funds will support the operational deficits of the USCs, GOS will release the monies \nbased on monthly invoices issued by USCs, duly examined by the independent verifier, and \nrecommended to the GOS for payment.  \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation, Appraisal, and Approval \n \n55.  Cluster  Formation  and  Subproject  Selection  and  Preparation.  The  road  map \nprepared for the urban sector in Sindh, along with the prioritization of investments within this \nroad map, forms the basis for inclusion of infrastructure subprojects under parts B and C of the \nInvestment Program. While the type of subprojects likely to be included under the second and \nsubsequent tranches of the Investment Program have been identified in program formulation, \nthe  beneficiary  city  clusters  and  exact  nature  of  subprojects  have  yet  to  be  determined. \nImplementation priorities may need to be adjusted to meet changing development challenges. \nThe PSU, in collaboration with the urban unit, will be responsible for assisting in further cluster \nformation (Box 1). The NSUSC and subsequent USCs will be responsible for the identification \nand preparation of subprojects proposed for funding in the second and subsequent tranches, in \naccordance with the provisions of the urban sector road map, Investment Program objectives, \nand good engineering practice.34 Cluster formation and all the subprojects proposed for funding \nunder the second and subsequent tranches must meet the subproject selection criteria set out \nin Schedule 4 to the FFA and adhere to environmental criteria presented in the environmental \nassessment and review framework and relevant safeguards. ADB will also review additional \n                                                 \n33 The skills-based selection criteria for the six independent directors will seek inclusion of qualified women for at \nleast one third of the six independent directors positions. \n34 Three likely clusters are Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, and Sukkur.  \n ", "16   \nsubprojects identified for funding under the second and subsequent tranches to ensure their \ncompliance with the provisions of the FFA. \n \n  Box 1: Selection Criteria for Town Clusters\n   \n  The Investment Program will be rolled-out to additional clusters of towns in phased and strategic manner, \ntiming investment with introduction of management capacity to deliver services. New clusters considered for \n \ninfrastructure financing will meet the following criteria: \n \n \n  (i)  The cluster will have an anchor town, together providing a critical mass for efficient operation of an \n  Urban Services Corporation. \n(ii)  The cluster\u2019s anchor town will be strategically located near transport links, and, owing to proximity to \n \nnatural and industrial resources, have capacity to generate economic growth and jobs. \n \n(iii)  Cluster towns will have jointly incorporated into urban services corporation under the Companies \n  Ordinance 1984. \n  (iv)  Cluster towns will have agreed to a package of institutional reforms aimed at the effective and \n  efficient management of urban services.  \n \n\u201cAnchor towns\u201d are defined as contiguous urban areas having urban population in excess of 150,000.  Other \n \ntowns within 150 km of the anchor town, having urban populations in excess of 50,000, may join the cluster.  For \n  inclusion in the program, the cluster should include an aggregate urban population of more than 350,000.  Neither \n  Karachi nor Hyderabad is eligible. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n56.  Subproject  Appraisal and Approval and Submission of PFRs. The PSU will be \nresponsible  for  detailed  appraisal  of  the  subprojects  with  the  assistance  of  the  program \nmanagement consultants. The PSU will prepare a summary subproject appraisal report based \non the feasibility studies carried out by the NSUSC and subsequent USCs with the assistance of \ntheir respective staff and consultants. Feasibility studies will include the rationale for each \nsubproject, the scope of work, a technical description and analysis, the cost estimates and \nfinancing  plan,  an  environmental  assessment,  a  resettlement  plan,  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan (as necessary), and the implementation arrangements along with financial, \neconomic, and institutional analyses. All summary subproject appraisal reports will be sent to \nADB for review and approval in a format agreed by GOS and ADB. If necessary, ADB may \nadvise the EA to modify the subproject appraisal reports. Following ADB approval, and subject \nto any modifications and measures required by ADB, GOS will prepare PFRs for ADB financing. \nPFRs will be formally submitted to ADB for further processing through the Government. \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule and Period \n57.  The overall implementation period for the Investment Program is 10 years, through 30 \nJune  2018.  The  Investment  Program  constitutes  an  essential  component  of  the  overall \ninvestment plan for the sector that is set out in the urban sector road map. Implementation of \nsubprojects is proposed in five tranches over the implementation period. The first tranche \ncomprises  eight  subprojects.  The  subprojects  included  under  the  first  tranche  have  been \nselected on the basis of their relative priority under the Investment Program, their readiness for \nimplementation, and their representative character in the context of the overall Investment \nProgram. It is anticipated that the first tranche will be implemented between January 2009 and \nJune 2012. Approval of the second and subsequent tranches will depend on (i) their state of \nreadiness, and (ii) GOS\u2019 compliance with the reform milestones set out in the reform action plan. \nThe implementation schedule for the MFF is in Appendix 9. \n \n4.  Procurement \n58.  Procurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \n ", "  17\nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedure  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts \nestimated to cost $5 million or more. Civil works contracts estimated to cost less than $5 million \nwill be procured under national competitive bidding (NCB).35 Single-stage two-envelope bidding \nprocedure with post-qualification will be adopted for all ICB and NCB civil works contracts under \nthe  Investment  Program.  ADB  has  reviewed  Pakistan\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  and \nprocurement procedures that are used for NCB (civil works and goods) and found them to be \nconsistent with ADB requirements. Water supply and wastewater contracts that may involve civil \nworks combined with supply and installation of equipment and goods will be considered as civil \nworks contracts, regardless of the proportion of costs associated with equipment or goods. \nAppendix 10 contains a procurement plan for the first tranche, and the figure below highlights \nNSUSC\u2019s main contract packages under the first tranche. \n \n59.  ICB procedures will be used to procure goods and services estimated to cost $1,000,000 \nor more. NCB procedures will be followed for procurement of goods and services estimated to \ncost less than $1,000,000. For specialized equipment, such as proprietary software and small \nmaterials contracts valued at less than $100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed. \n \nFigure 1: Select Contract Packages\u2013Infrastructure \nNSUSC \nManagement Team  Institutional \nManaging  Development and   Contract Packages  Method\nDirector  Program Implementation A1-A3: Consultancy Studies  QCBS\nADTA Component 1: QCBS\nOperational and Ogranizational\nFinance  Operations  Support\nDirector  Director \nWater Supply and  B1: Water Supply and ICB \nWastewater \n      Wastewater Improvements \nManagement \nImprovements  B2: Water Quality Testing  NCB \n  B3: Design and Construction  QCBS\nnit       Supervision, Mapping and \nU\ns        Feasibility\nk\nor\nW Solid Waste C1: Sanitary Landfills and NCB: Design-\nal  Management       Equipment  Build\npit Improvements C2: Secondary Collection ICB \na\nC        Equipment\nC3: Concrete Base for Skips  NCB \nB3: Design and Construction  QCBS\n       Supervision\n \nICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive bidding, NSUSC = North Urban Services \nCorporation Limited, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5.

Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures, consultant qualification selection, and/or individual consultant selection procedures \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Quality-based selection may be required where the technical expertise is the overriding \nrequirement. Where it can be reasonably justified, single-source selection may be necessary. \n                                                 \n35 Government of Sindh tendering procedures. \n ", "18   \nOutline terms of reference for the teams of consultants to support all aspects of Investment \nProgram execution are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n61.  Each respective entity, the PSU, the urban unit, and the NSUSC or other USCs, will be \nresponsible for processing consultant recruitment, as well as for supervising and monitoring \nconsultants\u2019 work. Logistical support will be provided to the consultants by the PSU, the urban \nunit and/or NSUSC and other USCs. Outputs will be reviewed and shared among the various \nentities, as appropriate. An indicative procurement plan for the Investment Program and a \ndetailed procurement plan for the first tranche subprojects are in Annex 3 of the PFR. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n \n62.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  GOS.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included in the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nwill  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of GOS, NSUSC and other USCs, and of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n63.  Good governance in municipal services requires, among other things, (i) information, \nskills, and autonomy to practice sound management; (ii) delinking tariffs and staffing from \npolitical  processes  that  keep  user  charges  low,  service  unsustainable,  consumers \nunempowered,  and  utilities  inefficient;  (iii)  rigorous  engineering,  mapping,  and  asset \nmanagement  (and  not  just  building);  (iv)  freedom  from  non-merit-based  human  resource \npractices, which, together with poor information systems and political influence, allow so-called \n\u201cghost\u201d workers to flourish; (v) curtailing distorted incentives that reward asset creation rather \nthan service delivery and customer satisfaction; (vi) discouraging mediocrity and acceptance of \nintermittent supplies and non-potable, nonrevenue water as the norm, because solving these \nproblems would curtail rent-seeking opportunities for those who understand how to work the \nsystems to their advantage; (vii) closing the disconnect between operations and planning and \nconstruction to enhance accountability for long-term performance of infrastructure assets; (viii) \nintroducing  contractual  arrangements  and  market  forces  to  clearly  define  roles  and \nresponsibilities, and to better align service provider incentives with performance requirements; \n(ix) helping customers understand that cost-recovery tariffs covering operations and, over time, \ncapital investment are essential to eliminate rent-seeking middlemen and hold service providers \nmore accountable to the consumer; and, finally, (x) discouraging \u201cvertical\u201d programs which, \nunless channeled appropriately through the USCs, will undermine progress toward sustainable \nurban services and revitalized secondary cities.36 \n   \n64.  In the context of anticorruption and good governance, the Investment Program aims to \nincrease GOS\u2019 public accountability and its service delivery institutions37 while reducing the risk \nof  corruption  by,  among  other  things,  (i)  introducing  USCs  as  autonomous  public  limited \ncompanies able to competitively hire qualified staff (including accountants) and ring-fence their \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 2003. Asian Water Supplies, Reaching the Urban Poor. Manila (Chapter 13). \n37 With respect to increased accountability for service delivery, the attached technical assistance (para. 77) will \nsupport NSUSC to establish transparent and accessible public and consumer grievance redress systems. It will \nsupport development of a citizen report card system. The findings from the surveys will be disseminated to the \npublic, and forums will be arranged to provide feedback to NSUSC senior management. \n ", "  19\nfinances;  (ii)  introducing  boards  of  directors  with  skills-based,  independent  nominees;  (iii) \neliminating the disconnect between asset creation and service outcomes by ensuring the USCs, \nnot other line agencies or entities, are responsible for infrastructure development; and (iv) \nintroducing contractual relationships between the stakeholders, including SAMAs and financing \nagreements. To further buttress the Investment Program reforms, TA will help NSUSC and GOS \nto (i) establish systems to monitor service delivery, and promote consumer awareness and \nprovider responsiveness; (ii) tackle the serious operational challenges of data management, \nnonrevenue water, and illegal connections; (iii) improve existing outsourcing contracts; and (iv) \nleverage private sector resources to incentivize better service delivery.  \n \n65.  GOS, through the PSU, urban unit, NSUSC, and subsequent USCs as formed, will \ndisclose basic information concerning activities and progress of the Investment Program, as \nappropriate,  including  progress  reports  on  sector  reform  actions,  procurement-related \ninformation, financial statements, and reports on physical progress and outcomes. With regard \nto procurement, lists of participating bidders, names of winning bidders, basic details of the \nbidding procedures adopted, contract values, and lists of goods and services procured will be \ndisclosed.  Consideration  will  be  given  to  adopting  e-tendering  processes  for  selected \nprocurement to enhance fair, transparent, and efficient bidding procedures. Information will be \ndisseminated widely on the relevant websites and at relevant office locations, including by \nposting to bulletin boards at offices of the participating TMAs, the regional offices of the PSU, \nand NSUSC customer service units at town level. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n66.  Each PFR will result in a separate loan agreement, which will describe the detailed \ndisbursement arrangements agreed between the Government and ADB. The individual loan \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \n67.  To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, \nimmediately  after  the  effectiveness  of  each  tranche,  two  project  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished at National Bank of Pakistan: one for P&DD and PSU to cover eligible expenditures \nunder parts A and D of the Investment Program, and one for NSUSC in the first tranche (then \none for each USC under the subsequent tranches) to cover eligible expenditures under parts A, \nB,  and  C.  Disbursement  arrangements  are  diagrammed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  In \nconnection with the P&DD\u2019s imprest account, P&DD will establish a separate escrow account at \nNational  Bank  of  Pakistan,  with  an  escrow  arrangement  and  independent  verification \nmechanism that are additional arrangements to manage the funds specifically for Part D, as \nelaborated in Supplementary Appendix E. The imprest accounts will be established, managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and the \nagreed detailed arrangements. The total amount to be deposited into the imprest accounts will \nnot exceed the estimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the \nimprest accounts for the next 6 months, or 10% of the related loan amount, whichever is lower. \nThe  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures for the Investment Program and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest \naccounts.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure will not exceed $100,000. The loan proceeds may also be disbursed \ndirectly to the consultants and contractors under the direct payment procedure. \n \n \n \n ", "20   \n8.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n68.  To  expedite  construction,  the  Government  has  requested,  and  ADB  has  approved, \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing for civil works, goods, and consulting services, \nincluding the recruitment of consultants for feasibility studies, detailed engineering designs, and \npreparation of bidding documents for subprojects and associated civil works.  \n \n69.  The Government and NSUSC (other USCs) were (will be) informed that, for expenses \nincurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  ADB\u2019s  retroactive  financing,  such \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the loan becomes effective, up to 20% of the \namount may be used to finance civil works, equipment, and consulting services expenditures \nincurred pursuant to advance contracting during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to \nsigning  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement  under  the  MFF.  Alternatively,  the \nGovernment and USCs may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in which \ncase the procurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with \nthe award of contract until after the loan becomes effective.  \n \n9.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Report \n \n70.  GoS through the PSU will establish an IPPMS acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the \neffectiveness of the first loan under the MFF. The IPPMS will help monitor and evaluate the \nperformance of the Investment Program, as well as of subprojects under each loan.  It will \nincorporate a set of performance monitoring indicators relating to outputs and outcomes in the \nDMF, including service delivery performance, physical implementation, institutional reform and \ncapacity-development milestones.  The PSU will develop baseline data for each of the selected \nindicators and conduct annual surveys with the assistance of consultants, and update ADB on \nthe progress against each indicator. For subprojects procured under the turnkey and design-\nbuild-operate modalities, key performance indicators satisfactory to ADB will be developed \nduring  the  preparation  of  requests  for  proposals  and  draft  contract  documents  for  each \nsubproject. \n \n71.   The PSU will prepare quarterly progress reports on the Investment Program, including \nprogress against the above performance monitoring indicators, to be submitted to ADB within 30 \ndays from the quarter\u2019s close. The reports will incorporate the information provided by each of \nthe USCs (through its board).38 The reports will discuss progress made during the period of \nreview, changes if any on implementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered and \nremedial actions taken, and work to be undertaken in the coming quarter. The USCs will also be \nresponsible for providing information as required to the independent verifier. \n \n10.  Investment Program Review \n \n72.  ADB, GOS, and the USCs will conduct quarterly review of the implementation of each \nindividual  tranche.  The  review  will  discuss the  progress of  the  individual  tranche  and  any \nchanges to implementation arrangements or remedial measures needing to be undertaken \ntoward achieving the objectives of the subprojects and overall Investment Program.  \n \n73.  A midterm review of each individual tranche will be undertaken by ADB, GOS, and the \nUSCs.  It  will  include  reviewing  a  summary  of  contracts  awards  and  disbursements, \n                                                 \n38 These targets will be reflected in each USC\u2019s annual work plan and budget and serve as the basis for monitoring \nprogress. \n ", "  21\nimplementation  progress  including  progress  against  service  delivery  performance,  reform, \ninstitutional development, and capacity building milestones. The midterm review will also identify \nproblems or weaknesses in implementation arrangements and agree on any changes needed. \nA similar midterm review of the Investment Program by ADB, GOS, and the USCs will be \nundertaken in the fifth year from the date of ADB\u2019s approving the MFF.  \n \n74.  GOS will submit to ADB of a subprogram completion report within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the subprogram, and an Investment Program completion report within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Investment Program. These reports shall provide detailed evaluation \nof the subprograms and the Investment Program, respectively, covering the design; costs; \ncontractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance;  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts; \neconomic rate of return; and other details for each subproject and the Investment Program, as \nmay be requested by ADB. \n \n11.  Project Review, Accounts, and Audits \n \n75.  The PSU,39 urban unit, and USCs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate \nto  identify  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  under  the  MFF,  including \nexpenditures for works, equipment, and services financed out of the loan proceeds and local \nfunds. Each USC should have a full set of financial statements. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by auditors acceptable to ADB. GOS will submit annual audited reports (including \nseparate audit opinions on use of the imprest account and the statement and expenditure \nprocedures) and audited financial statements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n76.  TA in the amount of $2,500,000 will be financed from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund to support (i) NSUSC in achieving performance improvement and implementing \norganizational changes required for sustainable service provision; and (ii) public awareness and \noutreach, public monitoring of services, and customer care systems. The TA aims to increase \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services delivered by \nNSUSC  to  its  customers.  P&DD  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA,  and  its  components  will  be \nimplemented by NSUSC and P&DD. Details on the TA and cost estimates are in Appendix 11. \n \n77.  The TA has two parts. Component A supplements the Investment Program\u2019s assistance \nto  NSUSC  for  achieving  technical  and  operational  improvements  and  implementing \norganizational  changes  specifically  to  (i)  assist  with  information  gathering,  (ii)  implement \noperational improvement programs, (iii) improve outsourcing arrangements, and (iv) develop \nand  implement  public-private  partnership  transactions.  Component  B  supports  (i)  customer \nawareness of reforms in water supply, wastewater, and SWM services; (ii) communications \nbetween  service  providers  and  customers;  (iii)  public  monitoring  of  service  delivery;  (iv) \naccountability  of  service  providers  to  the  public;  and  (v)  development  of  a  customer  care \nsystem.  \n \n78.  Component A will require 42 person-months of international and 100 person-months of \nnational consulting services. Component B will require 2 person-months of international and 20 \nperson-months of national consulting services, plus 315 person-months of customer relations \nstaff and IT support. The TA will be implemented over 44 months from April 2009. International \n                                                 \n39 Any regional offices of the PSU should maintain separate accounts. \n ", "22   \nand national consulting firms and individuals will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \nV.  PROGRAM INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n79.  An economic analysis was prepared for each of the proposed first tranche investments \nin water supply, wastewater, and SWM (Appendix 12). The gross economic benefits of the \nsubprojects and the first tranche program were evaluated based on willingness-to-pay (WTP) \nanalysis. Based on a recent survey,40 the mean WTP was calculated at PRs566 per month for \nservice charge and PRs3,620 for one-time connection. The evaluated economic costs of the \nsubprojects include (i) operating costs for the service provision after implementing subprojects, \nand (ii) capital costs of subprojects. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) values for the \nsubprojects range from 14% to 22% for water supply and wastewater improvements and 18% to \n44% for SWM improvements.  \n \n80.  Financial viability of NSUSC was evaluated through a financial model and in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines.41 Currently, the provision of water, wastewater, and SWM services is \nfinancially unsustainable. Collected tariffs cover a small fraction of operating costs, and the \nestimated loss in FY2006 for the subject towns in the first tranche is more than PRs130 million. \nThe Investment Program aims to first achieve significant improvements in service, making it \neasier to justify tariff increases necessary to achieve cost recovery. The NSUSC financial model \nindicates a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 5% for NSUSC over a 10-year projection \nperiod (2008\u20132018). The financial return reflects the gradual increase in average tariffs as \nservices improve and user fees are introduced or raised. The NSUSC operating revenues are \nprojected to improve, and it is able to cover operating costs by FY2017. However, NSUSC still \nhas to rely on GOS subsidies for TMA-deputed staff costs. The Investment Program is expected \nto achieve financial sustainability in water supply services over 3 years. Wastewater and SWM \nwill take longer, depending upon tariffs and any future tax-based cost recovery. The financial \nanalysis is in Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nB.  Financial Management Assessment \n81.  The financial management assessment revealed weak financial management at TMA \nlevel,  where  the  responsibility  for  basic  urban  services  resides.  The  Investment  Program \nsupports establishing USCs and financial management reforms at corporate level to address the \nimpact of these weaknesses on service provision. Financial management arrangements for the \nInvestment  Program  aim  to  create  obligations  for  a  higher  level  of  transparency  and \naccountability. 42  These  obligations  include  those  arising  from  incorporation  under  the \nCompanies Ordinance 1984, delegating functions of services delivery under SAMAs, obligating \npredictable flows of operations and maintenance financing under tripartite operational support \nfunding agreements, and professional oversight of operational support funds by an independent \nverifier. The Investment Program and supporting TA assist the design of operating procedures, \nfinancial safeguards, and monitoring systems, and they finance skilled technical specialists.

Financial management and \nreporting obligations cover, among others, (i) USC financial performance; (ii) disbursements from transition and \noperations support funding mechanisms; (iii) disbursement of capital expenditure funds; and (iv) subproject \npreparation, implementation, and progress monitoring. \n ", "  23\ninternal financial management systems for the USCs will conform to best practice design for \nutility  companies.  Part  A  of  the  Investment  Program  will  support  development  of  financial \nmanagement systems in USCs. Overall, the major risks are adequately mitigated under the \nInvestment Program, and adequate funding and guidance will be provided to construct financial \nmanagement  systems  on  a  fundamentally  sound  corporate  base.  The  summary  financial \nmanagement assessment is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nC.  Summary of Benefits, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development \n82.  The population of the Investment Program cluster TMAs, estimated at 4 million persons, \nwill enjoy sustainable benefits from the Investment Program through enhanced capacities for \ncity  planning,  management,  and  urban  service  delivery.  Specifically,  they  will  benefit  from \nimproved quality, continuity, and coverage of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services. \nResidents of some 20 secondary towns in Sindh will enjoy the benefits of enhanced living \nconditions and improved health as their basic urban services are upgraded and access to them \nexpanded. Benefits from the first tranche include (i) an estimated 18,000 new or rehabilitated \nwater supply connections under DNI zones targeting potable, continuous service (representing \na 55% increase over current registered connections); (ii) a 45% increase in treated water \navailability; (iii) priority fixes for drainage and sewerage problems; and (iv) secondary collection \ncapacity built to handle over 90% of the waste generation in each of the participating towns. \nTable  3  highlights  selected  tranche  1  benefits.  Less  tangible  benefits  include  (i)  improved \nfinancial planning, budgeting, and information systems (including system maps and inventories, \nthe building blocks for good utility management); (ii) greater customer orientation and more \ninformed, responsible consumers; and (iii) increased performance orientation as the corporate \nstructure affords deputed TMA staff the necessary physical resources and technical supervision \nto do their jobs well.    \n \nTable 3: Investment Program Benefits (Tranche 1) \nItem  2008\u20132009  2012\u20132013 \nHouseholds with Piped Connections (%)  37  52 \nNumber Households with Potable Water > 20 hours day in DNI zones  none  18,000 \nTreated Water Available (cubic meters per day)  none  83,646 \nHouseholds with Access to Solid Waste Collection (%)  37  90 \nWaste Collected (%)  46  95 \nNumber Sanitary Landfills in Interior Sindh  none  4 \n            DNI = distribution network improvement. \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n83.  As  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  strategy  in  Appendix  14  highlights,  many \nhouseholds in Sindh\u2019s secondary town areas have low incomes and many have no formal \nconnection to piped network services.43 These households represent a major consumer group \nand opportunity for the USCs. The Investment Program will support the development of service \ndelivery strategies for low-income consumers which can include reducing barriers to connection, \nusing small-scale service providers, adopting pro-poor tariffs, targeting customer outreach, and \nother  innovative  approaches  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  A  specially  staffed  low-income \nconsumer unit in NSUSC will initiate these strategies in North Sindh. \n \n84.  The Investment Program will have a particularly positive impact on women and children \nin the USC coverage areas. As household managers and caregivers, women are the primary \nusers of these basic urban services.  The Investment Program will finance advisory services to \n                                                 \n43 Of 864 households recently surveyed by Gallup Pakistan in North Sindh, 38% had no piped connection. New \nSukkur lags even further behind, with 73% of those surveyed being unconnected. \n ", "24   \ndevelop  gender-sensitive  customer  outreach  and  public  accountability  mechanisms.  USC \noutreach to customers at town level will be designed to reach women in their communities and \nin their homes.  A Gender Action Plan will guide mainstreaming these concerns for inclusion \nand  empowerment.  There  is  also  provision  for  one  third  of  the  USC  independent  board \nmembers to be women.  The Gender Action Plan is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nD.  Social and Environmental Safeguards  \n85.  Social  Safeguards. The Investment Program will minimize resettlement impacts by \nprioritizing  rehabilitation  and  optimizing  work  within  existing  facilities.  New  construction  is \nproposed on vacant government land where feasible. To ensure compliance with Government \nand  ADB  policies  and  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement,  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995), the applicable laws and regulations of Pakistan and Sindh \nProvince,  and  the  operational  procedures  for  MFF  processing.  The  LARF  will  guide  the \nimplementation of subprojects, outlining the objectives, policy principles, procedures for land \nacquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons. A \nsummary LARF is in Appendix 15, and the full LARF is in Supplementary Appendix K. Land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for subprojects in tranche 1 is expected to have \nnon-significant impacts and the tranche is categorized as B; short LARPs have been prepared \naccordingly. Appraisal of successive PFRs will require preparation of LARPs for all subprojects \nwith land acquisition and resettlement issues, to be presented for ADB approval with submission \nof the PFR. The subprojects in the first tranche of the MFF will have no impact on indigenous \npeoples. \n \n86.  Environmental  Safeguards.  The  provision  of  potable  piped-water  supply  plus \nwastewater and SWM improvements will improve the environment in each participating town. \nThe design involves simple, appropriate, low-cost technology and does not pose any significant \nadverse environmental consequences. The Investment Program has been categorized as B for \nthe purposes of environmental safeguards. Potential negative environmental impacts for each \nproject  are  mainly  short-term  in  nature  during  the  construction  period  and  can  be  easily \nminimized by the proposed mitigation measures and environmentally sound engineering and \nconstruction practices. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) prepared \nfollowing ADB procedures44 is in Supplementary Appendix L. For each PFR, the USCs will \nprepare initial environmental examinations (IEEs) or environmental impact assessments for \neach subproject or for groups of similar subprojects in the same subsector, as appropriate. The \nIEEs for the first tranche show no significant adverse environmental impacts (Supplementary \nAppendix M). As these IEEs, including environment management plans, were prepared based \non field reconnaissance survey and secondary reports, they will be improved during the detailed \nengineering design stage. ADB\u2019s review and clearance of the revised subproject IEE, including \nthe environment management plan, will be a condition precedent for release of relevant tender \ndocuments.  \n \n87.  Environmental subproject selection criteria ensure that the Investment Program will not \nhave significant negative environmental impacts and will have no impacts on environmentally \nsensitive  areas.  Impacts  that  are  potentially  significant  and/or  irreversible  will  be  avoided. \nPotential negative environmental impacts of typical subprojects are expected to be mostly \nlocalized and temporary. These impacts can largely be avoided through proper subproject \ndesign  (particularly  site  selection)  or  through  appropriate  choice  of  water  and  wastewater \n                                                 \n44 The EARF follows the environmental assessment and review procedures in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003).   \n ", "  25\ntreatment technologies and process design parameters. Alternatively, they can be mitigated \nthrough proper implementation of mitigation measures and environmental management. The \nEARF  will  help  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  government  and  ADB  environmental \nrequirements and guide the design and implementation of future subprojects. The safeguards \ncell of each USC will have an environmental safeguard specialist who, with assistance from an \ninternational environmental consultant, will apply the EARF. Training will be conducted by the \ninternational consultant to pertinent USC, PSU, and TMA staff.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n88.  The Investment Program faces a number of risks in implementation, but the key risks \nhave been discussed with the Government and mitigation measures agreed.  \n \n89.  Implementation Delays Due to Weak Capacity of New and Existing Institutions. \nThe Investment Program will finance teams of advisors to support the provincial PSU and urban \nunit and the USCs. Each USC will be staffed with appropriate senior management and technical \nsupervisors,  competitively  recruited  from  the  open  market,  in  addition  to  deputed  TMA \npersonnel  who  bring  their  institutional  memory.  Risks  of  delays  in  first  tranche  program \nimplementation  are  mitigated  through  upfront  grant  support  from  ADB\u2019s  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility to (i) expedite contracting for water supply and sanitation works, and (ii) \ndesign a public awareness campaign to sustain public and political momentum for reforms. \nBeyond this start-up period, attached advisory TA will help operationalize NSUSC and support \nservice delivery improvements.  \n \n90.  Delays in Government Reform Actions to Replicate the USC Model. These include \npotential political interference in the functions of the USCs and their boards. These risks have \nbeen mitigated in part through extensive dialogue with the Government since 2006 on the \nfundamental reforms under the Investment Program. The risk will be further mitigated through (i) \nlinkage  between  achieving  milestones  in  the  reform  action  plan  and  subsequent  financing \nrequest approvals, (ii) ADB\u2019s close supervision and continued dialogue with the highest levels of \nGOS on implementation, and (iii) targeted attached advisory TA support in these critical reform \nareas.   \n \n91.  Continued Vertical Funding of Capital Investments in NSUSC Coverage Areas.45 A \nmajor risk to the Investment Program is continued, ad hoc so-called \u201cvertical\u201d investment under \nvarious federal, provincial, and donor-supported programs that frequently results in low-grade \ninfrastructure assets, inadequately coordinated with the subsequent operator, without adequate \nprovision  for  operation  and  maintenance,  and  not  factored  into  any  tariff  setting.  Such \ninvestments are unsustainable. This type of funding would undermine the USCs and continue to \nfinancially burden the Government. These risks will need to be mitigated through a three-\npronged approach: (i) continued dialogue with federal, provincial, and local governments, and \ndonor partners; (ii) developing within the USC the capacity to effectively harness vertical funds; \nand (iii) GOS\u2019 notification of the USC as a single point of accountability for delivering the \nrelevant services to agreed coverage areas by routing any related government or development \npartner-supported project proposal through the USC.46 \n \n                                                 \n45 Vertical funding refers to provincial line agency or federally driven infrastructure investment in USC coverage areas \nthat is not part of the local planning process. Such investments typically fall outside any planning for operation and \nmaintenance or sustainability. \n46 This notification is to be provided as a condition precedent to any financing under the Investment Program, \npreferably as a condition precedent to loan negotiations. \n ", "26   \n92.  Weak Coordination Among GOS Agencies Whose Support is Necessary for USCs \nto Operate Effectively. This includes resistance from provincial line agencies that will no longer \nhave the construction mandate in USC coverage areas. The risk of weak coordination will be \naddressed through inclusion of PSU-supervised regional offices at town level to liaise on a daily \nbasis  between  NSUSC,  the  TMAs,  and  other  provincial  authorities.  In  addition,  incentive \nschemes will be established to recognize cooperative action between key TMA staff, and other \nline agency staff, and the relevant USC, based on USC performance against its business plan. \nProvincial line agencies, including the departments of Finance, Local Government, and Public \nHealth Engineering, will be on the PSC that is chaired by P&DD and charged with ensuring, \namong other things, high-level interagency coordination. \n \n93.  Lack of Interest by Private Sector Professionals and Firms Willing to Work in the \nProgram Areas. The Investment Program assumes professional managers and candidates for \nindependent board members can be attracted to work in or with a USC in interior Sindh. This \nrisk is mitigated by employing a professional recruitment firm to design the job description, \ncompensation  and  incentive  package,  and  employment  contract.  The  risk  is  considered \nmanageable given that there are examples of successful commercial operations in interior \nSindh, and given recent success by the Government of Punjab in recruiting on a competitive \nbasis managing directors for its water and sanitation authorities. \n \n94.  Resistance from TMA Staff Deputed to USCs. There is risk of poor cooperation from \nTMA staff to be deputed to the USCs from the TMA. This will be addressed by the proper design \nand consultation on the SAMAs to address conditions of deputed staff employment. These \nconsultations  will  allay  any  concerns  on  pension  rights  and  demonstrate  the  potential \nadvantages of USC employment, including incentivized pay, training, more assured resources, \nand  growth  opportunities.  The  risk  of  nonperformance  of  TMA  staff  deputed  to  USCs  is \nmitigated by provisions allowing for the USCs to transfer the staff back to the TMA after a \nprobationary period. \n \n95.  Resistance  by  Political  Leadership,  Government  Officials,  or  Customers  to \nIncreases in User Charges. There is agreement on the need for cost recovery in service \ndelivery, which is to be achieved as services are improved and trust rebuilt. WTP surveys \nsuggest the public is willing to pay for improved service. This risk will be mitigated by clear \narticulation of these principles in the SAMAs, through continued advocacy by NSUSC and the \nPSU, with support of tariff structuring advisors, and through the public awareness program \nunder the attached advisory TA. Concerns of low-income consumers will be addressed by a \nspecial unit with dedicated staff.47 There is binding assurance that restricts SCIP financing \nunder subsequent tranches to those TMAs that have increased their tariffs to levels agreed in \nthe USC business plans and consistent with WTP survey data and the independent verifier \nassessment. Government acceptance of these terms signals joint agreement on this essential \ncondition for sustainability. \n \n96.  Changes in the Sindh Local Government Ordinance or Local Government System. \nThe  Investment  Program  has  been  designed  to  withstand  possible  changes  in  the  local \ngovernment system by adopting a corporate structure and organization under the Companies \nOrdinance 1984. The USCs, as public limited companies with appropriate successor in interest \nprovisions, are considered sufficiently robust to withstand changes in federal or provincial law. \nThe reliance on professional management and corporate boards with independent directors \n                                                 \n47 Concerns from civil society over the perceived commercialization of urban service provision will be addressed \nthrough these outreach programs and public awareness activities. Adopting the pilot introduction of 24/7 service \ndelivery in DNI zones should also address these concerns. \n ", "  27\nshould also support continuity of program implementation as the local governance system \nevolves. \n \n97.  Subproject Implementation Delays Due to Political Instability and Potential Civil \nUnrest. The MFF structure, with its 10-year program period and flexible timing of loan tranches, \nmeans that the SCIP can adapt better to changes in the political and security environment. \nPakistan  and  Sindh\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  and  resilience  in  the  midterm  is  key  to \nmitigating such risks, and ADB has been working closely with the Government on the necessary \npolicy and structural reforms.48 Strong support by local political leaders and opinion makers, \nhowever,  will  be  the  more  important  factor  mitigating  such  risks.  Thus,  during  Investment \nProgram preparation, explicit support from political leadership was obtained.   \n \n98.  Governance Risks. Financial and operational management arrangements under the \nInvestment Program are unique in seeking to create obligations for greater transparency and \naccountability. Organizing service providers under the Companies Ordinance 1984 mandates \nmore  timely,  transparent,  and  independently  audited  financial  information;  managerial \nautonomy; and sound board governance. The SAMAs articulate roles and responsibilities, and \nthey  set  performance  targets.  The  Tripartite  Operational  Suport  and  Capital  Investment \nFinancing  Agreements  and  operational  support  funding  mechanism,  together  with  the \nindependent verifier function, obligate predictable financing flows for operations and investment. \nThe Investment Program mitigates governance and operational risk through these contractual \nobligations,  professional  and  independent  oversight  mechanisms  (complemented  by  citizen \nsatisfaction surveys under the attached advisory TA and under the proposed Sindh Growth and \nRural Revitalization Program), and strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation wing of \nP&DD. Finally, at the corporate level under tranche 1, the Investment Program and related TA \nwill support enhanced operating procedures, financial safeguards, monitoring systems, and \ncorporate governance training. Overall, key risks are adequately mitigated under the Investment \nProgram, with specific funding and guidance to ensure that the new urban service providers are \nrooted in a fundamentally sound corporate base. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n99.  The Government and GOS have agreed to the following specific assurances, in addition \nto the standard assurances, which will be incorporated in the FFA and the individual loan \nagreements as applicable, subject to any amendments to be mutually agreed upon by the \nGovernment and ADB: \n \n(i)  The  Government  and  GOS  will  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  agreed \nreforms set forth in the Strategic Action Plan for Reform and Investment, which is \npart of the urban sector road map and Investment Program. \n(ii)  The Government and GOS will ensure that ADB is kept informed on policies and \nprograms related to municipal services in the secondary towns of Sindh and \nother policies and programs that will materially affect the financial viability of each \nsubproject under the Investment Program. \n(iii)  Prior to any intervention related to water supply, wastewater, and solid waste \nmanagement infrastructure and services in a particular town cluster under the \nInvestment Program, GOS will ensure the timely incorporation of the relevant \n                                                 \n48 These programs include the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program and the proposed Sindh Growth and \nRural Revitalization Program.   \n ", "28   \nUSCs pursuant to the Companies Ordinance 1984, as may be amended from \ntime to time and allow the USC to operate as a limited liability company. \n(iv)  Prior to any intervention related to water supply, wastewater, and solid waste \nmanagement infrastructure and services in a particular town cluster under the \nInvestment Program, GOS will issue the necessary notification(s) to allow USCs \nto effectively plan, design, construct, operate, manage, and maintain all water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste management infrastructure and services, in \ntheir respective coverage areas. The coverage areas will be the areas to be \nagreed upon between the GOS, the relevant TMAs and USCs, to the satisfaction \nof ADB. \n(v)   GOS will provide the necessary resources needed to ensure that (a) the USCs \nestablished under the Investment Program are effective, sustainable vehicles for \nthe delivery of water supply, wastewater, and solid waste management services, \nand (b) the facilities constructed under the Investment Program will continue to \nbe in good condition during and after the completion of the Investment Program. \n(vi)  GOS will ensure that the participating TMAs increase their tariffs to customers \nreceiving improved services and that the increase will be to appropriate levels, \ntaking  into  consideration  general  willingness-to-pay  survey(s)  from  reputed \nfirm(s) acceptable to ADB, and the real cost of delivering the improved service as \nassessed by the independent verifier. \n(vii)  GOS  will  ensure  that  the  USCs  have  adequate  enforcement  mechanism  to \neffectively collect service fees and penalize defaulters in order to improve the \ncollection  efficiency,  deter  non-payment  and  ensure  sustainability  of  USC \noperations. \n(viii)  GOS will provide the USCs with timely assistance and support to ensure that the \nUSCs are able to effectively carry out their entire obligations to be set out under \nthe SAMAs, which will be entered into between the relevant TMAs and the \nrelevant USCs. \n(ix)  GOS will provide the necessary resources needed to ensure that the TMAs \nparticipating in the Investment Program are adequately staffed.  \n(x)  The Government and GOS will, and will cause the USCs, to ensure that all \nsubprojects and town clusters are selected in accordance with the agreed criteria \nset out in the Schedule 4 of the FFA and other applicable requirements and \nguidelines for subproject implementation. The Government and GOS will monitor \nthe implementation of subprojects up through the completion of each subproject. \n(xi)  The Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, ensure that (a) all land \nand rights-of-way required for any subproject under the Investment Program are \nmade available in a timely manner, including the requirement for allocation in the \nannual budget for the financing of land acquisition and related resettlement costs \nunder the Investment Program; (b) upon completion of the detailed design and \ndetailed  measurement  survey,  the  resettlement  plans  under  the  Investment \nProgram will be prepared in full consultation with the affected people and in \naccordance with the LARF agreed upon between GOS and ADB and will be \npromptly disclosed to the affected people; (c) any reports on the implementation \nof the resettlement plan to be prepared by an external monitoring and evaluation \nagency will be submitted to ADB on periodic basis, and (d) the entire involuntary \nresettlement  activities  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with the LARF and resettlement plans agreed upon between GOS \nand  ADB,  the  relevant  national  and  local  policies  on  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n(xii)  Prior  to  issuance  of  notice  for  mobilization  for  civil  works  activities  under  a \nsubproject, GOS will ensure that (a) the LARP has been disclosed to the affected \n ", "  29\npeople and submitted to ADB for review and approval, (b) the negotiations on the \nresettlement entitlements with the affected people have been completed, and (c) \nthe affected people have been satisfactorily compensated for their loss through \ncash payment or land replacement or other forms of agreed entitlement. \n(xiii)  In the event of any changes to the agreed LARPs, including on the agreed \ncompensation  to  the  affected  people,  GOS  will  inform  ADB  and  update  the \nLARPs accordingly, and submit the updated resettlement plans to ADB for review \nand approval.  \n(xiv)  The Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, ensure that the design, \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of all subproject facilities are carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and the Government\u2019s \nEnvironmental Protection Act, 1997. Any adverse environmental impacts arising \nfrom the construction, operation, and implementation of subproject facilities will \nbe minimized by implementing the environmental mitigation and management \nmeasures  and  other  recommendations  specified  in  the  EARF  and  initial \nenvironmental examinations/environmental impact assessments, as applicable. \nSubproject assessment will be conducted in accordance with the EARF, which \nhas been prepared based on the Government\u2019s environmental requirements and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Any  change  in  subproject  scope  will  be \nclassified  and  environmental  assessment  conducted  in  accordance  with  the \nEARF. In addition, the Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, \nensure that the environmental management and monitoring plan will be strictly \nimplemented. The Government, GOS, USCs, and ADB will also review progress \nin the implementation of the environmental management and monitoring plan \ncovering the subprojects financed under the loan prior to processing the follow-\nup loans. The Government and GOS will, and will cause the USCs to, submit to \nADB annual monitoring reports on subprojects\u2019 environmental performance in \naccordance with the EARF.  \n(xv)  The Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, implement the gender \naction  plan  prepared  under  the  Investment  Program  to  encourage  gender-\nbalanced  consultation  and  participation  in  Investment  Program  planning  and \nimplementation,  including  representation  of  qualified  women  on  the  USCs\u2019 \nBoards  of  Directors.

Strategic Context \n \n1.  Pakistan is the most urbanized country in South Asia, with an urban population expected \nto be half of the total population by 2015. There is an urgent need to revitalize urban centers in \nPakistan to improve living standards and provide more competitive platforms for economic \ngrowth. At present, Pakistan\u2019s cities and towns, including the secondary towns in Sindh, are \nconstrained by weak local government capacity; insufficient focus on cost recovery and own-\nsource revenue generation; inadequate infrastructure; absent or inefficient municipal service \nproviders; and a lack of urban management and planning systems. Inasmuch as Pakistan \nenvisions cities as engines of national growth, centers of economic activity and knowledge, and \nfocal  points  for  cultural  change,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  considers  urban \ndevelopment a strategic priority. Investment in the urban sector in Sindh draws on ADB\u2019s \ndemonstrated capacity in infrastructure development and its ability to catalyze public-private \npartnerships in service delivery. The multitranche financing facility modality affords scope for a \nprogrammatic, long-term approach to revitalizing cities, guided by road maps for critical sector \nand institutional reforms. The Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program (SCIP or the \nInvestment Program) is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s forward assistance program that supports \nurban service delivery, sustainable basic infrastructure, improved urban transport systems, and \nstrengthened governance and institutions for better municipal management.1 A core strategic \nobjective of ADB assistance is to promote efficient, effective, and customer-focused service \nproviders  with  incentives  and  capacity  to  improve  quality,  continuity,  and  coverage  of \ninfrastructure services.   \n \nB.  Road Map \n \n2.  The vision for the urban sector is accelerated national growth and productivity through \nmore efficient and competitive cities and towns. Municipalities in Sindh should have  \n(i)  well-managed utilities;  \n(ii)  sound financial management; \n(iii)  proper regulatory and oversight arrangements; and \n(iv)  measurable, targeted, and sustainable subsidies where they are necessary. \n \n3.  The Investment Program seeks to improve the quality, coverage, and reliability of water \nsupply,  wastewater  management,  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  services  for  an \nestimated 4 million residents in participating secondary cities in Sindh Province. Enhanced \nfinancial sustainability of these services is essential. Under the Investment Program, service \nproviders will have clear roles and strengthened lines of accountability, be reoriented toward \ncost recovery and sustainability, and be incentivized to perform. The following underpins the \nurban sector road map: \n(i)  Sustainability. Focus on the institutional context and on service delivery, with \ninfrastructure development seen in this context. \n(ii)  Efficiency.  Seek  efficiency  by  leveraging  economies  of  scale  through \nestablishing  regional  utilities  and  clustering  local  governments,  introducing \nprivate sector participation, effective outsourcing, and management contracts.  \n                                                 \n1  The country partnership strategy is under preparation. \n ", "Appendix 3  39         \n \n(iii)  Accountability.  Pursue  corporate  models  and  markets,  including  service \ncompacts and contracts; costs and performance benchmarking; and ensuring \ninformation flow to customers to strengthen accountability of service providers. \n(iv)  Strategic Approaches. Look for opportunities to tap geographic and regional \nresources, such as trade links, transportation corridors, and business clusters. \n(v)  Finance. Ensure asset investment is linked to strategies for maintenance and \ncost recovery.  \n \nC.  Policy Framework \n \n4.  The Investment Program is anchored within a holistic and integrated service delivery \nreform agenda, comprising (i) an enabling policy framework for service delivery reform, (ii) \neffective institutions and professional management, and  (iii) sustainable financing of urban \nservice provision. The strategic action plan for reform and investment is in Table A3.1. These \nkey reform milestones will trigger the release of the first, second and subsequent tranches of the \ninvestment loan. Together, the Investment Program and sequenced institutional reforms seek to \ntransform service delivery in urban Sindh in two-stages (Box A3.1). \nBox A3.1: Two-Stage Reform Process\nThe Investment Program proposes a progressive, two-stage reform process. During the first stage, \nparticipating cluster taluka municipal administrations (TMAs) join together to form a corporatized operating utility \nto take full responsibility for water supply, wastewater, and solid waste management systems. These urban \nservices corporations (USCs) will aggregate water, wastewater, and solid waste management operations of all \nparticipating TMAs into a single institution to take advantage of economies of scale and to share the overhead \ncosts of professional management. Incentivized agreements will be put into place between the TMAs and USCs, \nthen further developed with more private sector involvement under second-stage reforms and introduction of \nperformance-based management contracting. The USCs are transition arrangements before introducing more \ncomprehensive public-private partnerships with technically qualified private operators from Pakistan\u2019s business \ncommunity\u2014teamed up with international operator expertise\u2014to provide a more robust solution to the challenge \nof service delivery and infrastructure development.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nD.  Investment Program \n \n5.  Overview.  The  Investment  Program  aims  to  improve  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, and SWM services to clusters of secondary cities in Sindh (Box A3.2). This, in \nturn, will improve the urban environment, public health, and economic opportunities for an \nestimated 4 million urban residents of Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities. This will be achieved through \nan  integrated  program  of  institutional  reforms  and  investments  in  priority  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and improvements. The key institutional reform is the establishment of USCs, as \npublic limited companies, by participating local governments.

Sound  project  management  arrangements  and  reforms  are  essential  nonphysical \ninvestments for efficient and timely delivery of outputs and outcomes from the Sindh Cities \nImprovement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  Physical  investments  in \ninfrastructure alone are not sufficient to deliver the Investment Program objectives. The Urban \nPlanning, Institutional Development, and Program Implementation component (part A) will assist \nwith project execution functions, promoting reforms, and developing national capacity. Together \nwith the support for engineering design and construction supervision under parts B and C, the \nInvestment Program will assist with (i) implementation of the first-tranche investments; (ii) due \ndiligence on, and preparation of, second and subsequent tranche investments; and (iii) urban \nsector planning, sector and institutional reforms, and results measurement. This nonphysical \ninvestment\u2014the program management, capacity development, and implementation support\u2014is \nessential  to  the  Investment  Program.  It  backstops  and guides  the Government  and  urban \nservices corporation (USC) efforts to end the vicious cycle of weak planning, management, and \ninfrastructure that leads to failed urban services delivery.   \n \n2.  The  teams  of  consultants  contracted  through  firms  and  individually  will  assist  the \nInvestment Program\u2019s execution at the provincial and USC levels. They will support (i) the \nprogram support unit (PSU) and the urban policy and strategic planning unit (urban unit), both \nwithin the Planning and Development Department (P&DD), at provincial level, and (ii) the USCs. \nAt provincial level, individual national consultants will be contracted on a full-time basis under \nthe PSU and the urban unit. These individual specialists, together with permanent government \nstaff, will form core, full-time teams in each unit. These full-time teams will be guided by \nadvisory consultants, comprising international and national experts, hired under a firm tasked to \nflexibly  support  the  provincial  government  in  executing  the  Investment  Program.  The  core \nimplementing  arms,  the  USCs,  will  have  permanent  professional  senior  management  and \ntechnical supervisors, recruited from the market, to implement the infrastructure subprojects and \noperate  the  systems.1  Under  the  first  tranche,  North  Sindh  Urban  Services  Corporation \n(NSUSC)  will  have  three  levels  of  management  or  supervisory  staff  for  this  function.  The \narrangements for the first tranche are outlined below. In subsequent tranches, the level of \nconsultant inputs will decrease as capacity is developed in the PSU, urban unit, and USCs. \n \nB.   Key Tasks of Advisory and Support Teams \n \n3.

Support for capacity development will cut across these three organizations. The advisory \nteams will provide on-the-job and more formal group training throughout to PSU, USC, urban \nunit, and relevant provincial, district and taluka-based staffing order to, among other things,  \n(i)  develop provincial-level capacity to promote economic growth, coordinate urban \ninvestment, improve urban planning, and promote regulatory and tariff reforms;  \n(ii)  develop district and local level capacity for urban planning;   \n(iii)  orient talukas in their new roles as NSUSC shareholders;  \n(iv)  further develop NSUSC manager and staff capacity for utility operations and \nmanagement, including financial management and controls;  \n(v)  develop  NSUSC  and  PSU  capacity  for  due  diligence,  including  subproject \nidentification, preliminary design, and economic and financial evaluation; \n(vi)  develop NSUSC capacity for procurement of works and service contracts and \nPSU and urban unit capacity for services contracts; and \n(vii)  develop  PSU  and  NSUSC  capacity  for  safeguards  compliance,  results \nmonitoring, and program evaluation. \n \n5.  The program management, capacity building, and subproject implementation assistance \nput the Government of Sindh (GOS) and NSUSC at the core of executing their respective \ncomponents while providing qualified, full-time national and intermittent international expertise \nas support. A contingent amount will be allocated for the PSU, urban unit, and NSUSC to \nfacilitate engaging additional expertise according to need, thus allowing enhanced flexibility \nconsistent with the Investment Program\u2019s focus on innovation and change management. In \naddition, support will be provided to NSUSC for subproject design and construction supervision, \nmapping  and  feasibility  studies,  and  preliminary  design  and  subproject  preparation.

Background \n \n1.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  reform  initiatives  under  the  Sindh  Cities \nImprovement Investment Program (the Investment Program or SCIP) and assist the newly \nformed  North  Sindh  Urban  Services  Corporation  (NSUSC)  to  become  a  more  efficient, \naccountable service provider. The TA has two integral components. Component A will develop \nthe technical, operational, and organizational capacity of NSUSC to deliver sustainable water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste management (SWM) services. Component B will support \npublic awareness and outreach, public monitoring of services, and customer relations. The TA is \nconsistent with the Pakistan country strategy and program (update) 2006\u201320081 that supports \nurban sector interventions focusing on institutional reform and improvement in service delivery. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n2.  The TA aims to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of water supply, wastewater, and \nSWM services delivered by NSUSC while also increasing its accountability to its customers.  \n \n3.  The  outcomes  under  component  A  include  (i)  technical  and  financial  information \nbaselines  and  improved  information  on  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  systems;  (ii) \nenhanced technical capacity of NSUSC staff; (iii) improved NSUSC technical and financial \nperformance; (iv) increased and more effective outsourcing arrangements; and (v) increased \npublic-private partnerships in water services and landfill operations.    \n \n4.  The outcomes under component B include (i) customer awareness and understanding of \nSCIP-supported  reforms  in  urban  service  delivery,  (ii)  increased  communication  between \nNSUSC and its customers, (iii) transparent public monitoring of service delivery, (iv) enhanced \naccountability of NSUSC to its customers, and (v) development of a customer relations system \nwithin NSUSC.  \n \nC.  Methodologies and Key Activities \n \n1.  Component  A:  Technical,  Operational,  and  Organizational  Support  to \nNSUSC \n \n5.  Part A of the Investment Program supports NSUSC\u2019s basic technical, planning, and \nfinancial capacity. Component A supplements this by further developing technical, operational, \nand  organizational  capacity  to  increase  NSUSC\u2019s  efficiency  and  prepare  for  second-stage \nreforms. \n \n6.  Component A will support initiating and implementing information-gathering programs \nrequired under SCIP\u2019s service and asset management agreements and necessary for NSUSC\u2019s \neffective operation. These are directed to (i) developing baselines for, among other things, \nnonrevenue water, network pressures, number of connected customers, percentage of solid \nwaste  collected,  and  composition  of  waste;  (ii)  designing  and  implementing  improvement \nprograms in technical operations, commercial operations, and customer service;2 (iii) assisting \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program (Update). Manila. \n2  Programs would target, among others, nonrevenue water reduction, leakage detection, regularization of illegal \nconnections and improvement in customer complaint response times. ", "68  Appendix 11 \nNSUSC  to  manage  and  improve  outsourcing  contracts  and  develop  improved  outsourcing \nmodels;  (iv)  providing  hands-on  training  to  NSUSC  staff  in  skills  required  for  operational \nimprovement  programs;  and  (v)  reviewing  public-private  partnership  options  for  landfill \noperations and water services provision, including to recommend preferred options and build \nconsensus for implementation. \n \n2.   Component  B:  Public  Awareness  and  Outreach,  Public  Monitoring,  and \nCustomer Relations \n \n7.  Citizens\u2019  participation  is  integral  to  reforming  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM \nservices under SCIP. The TA component will develop an institutionalized system of public \nawareness  and  outreach,  public  monitoring,  and  customer  relations  to  improve  NSUSC\u2019s \neffectiveness and accountability to its customers. The TA will build on consultations and public \nawareness  activities  carried  out  with  nongovernmental  and  civil  society  organizations  and \nstakeholders  during  the  preparation  phase.  Component  B  includes  support  for  (i)  public \nawareness and communication activities, (ii) citizen report card surveys, and (iii) a computerized \ncustomer relations and complaints redress system. NSUSC customer relations units will be \nestablished in each taluka. Staffing of the units and customer relations management will be \nprovided for a period of 2 years under the TA. These activities will be subsequently subsumed \nwithin NSUSC\u2019s operational costs as NSUSC develops. The public outreach and customer \nrelations activities will identify specific communication needs for both men and women, as well \nas policies for NSUSC to pursue for increasing low-income households\u2019 access to improved \nservices. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,900,000, with $2,500,000 equivalent from the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund and $400,000 in counterpart financing from the Government \nand NSUSC. Component A costs total $1,885,000, while those for component B come to \n$490,000, and $125,000 is budgeted for contingencies. The counterpart contributions include \noffice facilities, utilities, administrative support, counterpart staff, secretarial support, supplies, \nlocal transportation, and miscellaneous training costs. Table A11 summarizes the costs.   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  The Planning and Development Department (P&DD) will be the Executing Agency for \nthe TA. NSUSC will be the Implementing Agency responsible for component A, while P&DD and \nNSUSC will be responsible for implementing their respective activities under component B. The \nSCIP\u2019s program support unit within P&DD will oversee the citizen report card subcomponent. \n \n10.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  44  months  from  April  2009,  with  inputs  from \ninternational and national consultants hired through a firm for each of the two components. A \ncivil society organization will be contracted separately for the citizen report card activity under \ncomponent B. The planned level of effort for component A is 142 person-months, comprising 42 \nperson-months of international inputs and 100 person-months of national inputs. The planned \nlevel of effort for Component B is 337 person-months in total, comprising 22 person-months of \nadvisory inputs (primarily national), 312 person-months of customer complaints staff, and 3 \nperson-months of information technology support.

The outline terms of reference are in Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n ", "70  Appendix 12   \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Objectives of the Program \n1.  The objective of the Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program (the Investment \nProgram)  is  to  improve  the  quality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement (WWM), and solid waste management (SWM) services in participating secondary \ncities. The Investment Program targets this outcome through a combination of institutional and \nsector reforms, capacity development, and priority infrastructure investments.  \n \nB.  Identification of Problems \n2.  Taluka municipal administrations (TMAs) are responsible for municipal services and \nregulations.  Municipal  services  include,  among  others,  water  supply,  WWM,  and  SWM. \nHowever,  the  TMAs  lack  sufficient  organization,  capacity,  and  resources  to  deliver  such \nservices  effectively.  The  provision  of  water  supply,  WWM,  and  SWM  services  in  Sindh \nsecondary cities is chaotic. There are no organized water supply and WWM authorities, no \nsystems for monitoring quality of service, and no maps of existing infrastructure. Data on service \ncoverage for the urban populations outside Karachi is poor, but piped-water access is estimated \nat less than 50% and the piped water is frequently contaminated. Similarly, access to sewerage \nor drainage (primarily open drains) varies considerably, but it averages around 60%. Less than \n40% of households are served by SWM systems, and there are no sanitary landfills. Cost \nrecovery averages about 30% of operating and maintenance costs for water supply in first-\ntranche towns, and it is negligible for WWM and SWM. \n \nC.  Economic Rationale \n3.  Under  the  current  infrastructure  provision  arrangements,  investing  in  physical \ninfrastructure  will  not  bring  the  desired  service  improvements.  Physical  investments  not \naccompanied by reforms only feed a vicious cycle of inadequate service provision. Due to the \nlimited capacity of the public sector, municipal service reforms need to (i) create an enabling \nenvironment for efficient service provision by the private sector; (ii) promote accountability for \nservice delivery, not simply scheme construction; (iii) introduce a service-focused management \nmodel; (iv) address key technical weaknesses in the delivery systems; and (v) be politically \nacceptable. \n \n4.  Public Sector Intervention. Based on these criteria, the initial model developed for the \nInvestment Program is a public limited corporation, formed under the Companies Ordinance Act \n1984 and owned by the participating local governments. Under tranche 1, the North Sindh \nUrban Services Corporation (NSUSC) will provide water supply, WWM, and SWM services \ninitially  to  a  cluster  of  six  participating  TMAs.  NSUSC  senior  management  and  technical \nsupervisors will be recruited competitively from the market.   \n \n5.  The corporate model introduces a higher level of accountability for providing urban \nservices. While greater private sector participation (PSP) could incentivize more efficient service \ndelivery, a first-stage public sector reform is necessitated by the limited capacity to manage \nPSP, varying political receptivity to PSP, absence of reliable data to assess and price risk, and \nembryonic nature of the private sector in urban services. The Investment Program\u2019s attached \ntechnical assistance will support PSP transactions to incentivize improved service provision, \nparticularly in urban water supply and SWM. \n ", "Appendix 12  71 \n6.  Aggregation and Multiple Ownership. The benefits of grouping several TMAs into a \nsingle organization for urban service provision include economies of scale, sharing the cost of \nprofessional  management  and  systems,  and  balancing  the  interests  among  participants. \nSimilarly, multiple ownership can temper politically motivated decisions, help professionalize \nmanagement,  and  improve  transparency  and  corporate  governance.  Participating  local \ngovernments have expressed support for aggregating as shareholders in a common urban \nservices corporation. Perceived advantages include better defined TMA roles under contractual \nagreements  and  a  convenient  venue  for  TMA  joint  action.  As  the  service  and  asset \nmanagement  agreements  (SAMAs)  are  designed  to  accommodate  individual  town \nrequirements, based on TMA commitment to reforms, this allows for more performance-based \nallocation of resources and discourages free-rider behavior from TMAs less willing to reform.  \n \n7.  The economic benefits of subsector investments were evaluated for the water supply, \nWWM,  and  SWM  subsectors.  For  each  participating  TMA,  the  economic  benefits  were \nevaluated only for those subsectors that will benefit from additional investment in that particular \nTMA. Likely benefits, costs, and the calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) from \nsubsector interventions for each town are described below. \n \nD.  Alternative Analysis \n8.  Alternative subprojects were considered in each subsector and in each town. In all cases \nof  water  supply  and  WWM  subprojects,  the  alternatives  were  rehabilitation  of  existing \ninfrastructure  or  building  of  new  infrastructure.  Rehabilitating  existing  infrastructure  was \nregarded as the least-cost approach.  \n \n9.  Alternatives  to  sanitary  landfills  include  incineration,  hydrolysis,  digestion,  and  gas \nplasma. These alternatives are technically too complex and their capital cost too high. Two \nalternative solid waste secondary collection systems were reviewed: skip hoist vehicles and a \nmixed fleet of tractor-trailers, trucks, and loaders. While the capital cost of skip hoist vehicles is \nhigher, they were chosen because they (i) avoid double handling of waste, which is a key \ntechnical requirement; (ii) can make more trips per day since they have higher average speed \nand much shorter loading time; (iii) are more reliable than tractor-trailers when traveling longer \ndistances;  and  (iv)  require  less  staff  to  operate.  Overall,  lower  operating  costs  offset  the \nincreased capital costs.  \n \nE.  Methodology \n10.  The  economic  analysis  is  based  on  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines, \nincluding the Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997); Handbook for the Analysis of \nWater Supply Projects \u2013 Guidelines, Handbooks and Manuals (1999); and ERD Technical Note \n23: Good Practices for Estimating Reliable Willingness-to-Pay Values in the Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector (2007).  \n \n11.  The economic analysis examined subsector investments in water supply, WWM, and \nSWM by TMA in tranche 1. Investments were evaluated over a 15 to 20-year period depending \non asset life. Costs and benefits are forecast in 2008 prices. The analysis combines the Rohri \nwater supply and wastewater investments, as wastewater improvements have significant impact \non the quality of the raw water source for Rohri.  \n \n12.  For each subsector investment, the EIRR was calculated for the net stream of economic \nbenefits. The net economic benefit was calculated by subtracting the economic costs from the ", "72  Appendix 12 \ngross economic benefits of the subprojects. Economic net present values were calculated by \ndiscounting at 12%.  \n \nF.  Gross Economic Benefits \n \n13.  The contingent valuation method was used to evaluate the gross economic benefits. \nThis method was used since the willingness-to-pay figures capture the whole spectrum of \nbenefits derived by the consumers from urban service improvements. To calculate the gross \neconomic  benefits,  the  willingness-to-pay  figure  for  each  of  the  improved  services  was \nmultiplied by the number of consumers benefiting from these services.  \n \n14.  Willingness-to-pay  values  cover  four  main  types  of  service  provided:  (i)  24/7  water \nsupply in pilot distribution network improvement (DNI) zones (monthly service and one-time \nconnection fee); (ii) regular but intermittent water supply service, with improved water quality in \nthe existing parts of the water supply network; (iii) wastewater services; and (iv) SWM services. \nThe estimated willingness to pay for 24/7 water supply service in the DNI zones was calculated \nat PRs566 per month using regression analysis based on a 2008 survey. 1 The willingness-to-\npay values for improved water service in the old network was estimated at PRs175 per month \nbased on the respondents\u2019 answers in a survey regarding provision of less-improved services. \nThe  WWM  and  SWM  willingness-to-pay  values  were  estimated  at  PRs100  and  PRs80, \nrespectively, based on social surveys in 12 Sindh secondary towns in 2006. \n \n15.  The number of customers benefiting from the improved services is equivalent to the \nnumber of customers assumed in the financial model (Appendix 13) during the tranche 1 period. \nUnauthorized water supply customers were estimated to be 40% of the starting authorized \nwater supply customers.2 The gross economic benefit values are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nG.  Economic Costs \n16.  All costs used in the analysis were actual real economic costs. The economic operating \ncosts of providing the service are assumed to be the benefits customers derive from that \nservice.  The  economic  operating  costs  are  based  on  nominal  financial  costs  used  in  the \nfinancial model deflated to 2008 prices. The real costs were converted to border parity prices \nusing a conversion factor of 0.75 for labor and 0.9 for other operating costs. The economic \ncapital costs are based on the financial capital costs used in the investment plan, and exclude \nall price contingencies, interest costs, taxes, and duties. Details on economic costs are in \nSupplementary Appendix G. The details of capital expenditure are in Appendix 6. \n \nH.  Results of the Economic Analysis \n \n17.  Table A12.1 summarizes the results of the economic analysis.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Gallup Pakistan. 2008. Willingness-to-Pay Survey. Pakistan. The study covers 864 households and commercial \nenterprises in Larkana, New Sukkur, Rohri, and Sukkur City. Estimates for WWM and SWM are based on social \nsurveys undertaken by PPTA 4534-PAK: Sindh Basic Urban Services Corporation (Nippon Koei) and TA 4432-\nPAK: Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh (Halcrow) covering 12 towns, including 5 of 6 first-\ntranche towns. Commercial willingness to pay for water supply and WWM is assumed twice as high as the \ndomestic willingness to pay.  \n2  Based on the assumption that nonrevenue water is 50%, with 30% technical losses and 20% commercial losses. \nAuthorized and unauthorized consumption are estimated at 50% and 20%, respectively, of water produced. \nUnauthorized customers are estimated at 40% of authorized customers.

Overall, the economic analysis indicates that all of the investments are economically \nviable,  each  having  a  positive  EIRR  even  in  the  worst-case  sensitivity  analysis  scenario. \nLarkana SWM and Sukkur, New Sukkur, and Rohri SWM have high EIRRs due to significant \neconomies of scale, since they serve more than one TMA. Khairpur water supply and Shikarpur \nSWM EIRR values are robust overall, and they remain above the 12% threshold even in the \nworst-case scenario. Sukkur and New Sukkur water supply, Khairpur WWM, Khairpur SWM, \nand  Rohri  water  supply  and  WWM  have  positive  EIRRs,  but  these  are  more  sensitive  to \nfluctuations in revenue. The results of the sensitivity analysis are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nI.  Distribution of Benefits \n \n19.  The improvements in all three services will benefit the whole of the urban population in \nthe six participating TMAs. Predictable flows of quality water supply, improved wastewater \nmanagement, and increased solid water collection will have positive impacts on the health of the \npopulation, quality of life, and economic prospects in the TMAs. Both the Investment Program \nand  attached  advisory  technical  assistance  include  components  to  support  service \nimprovements for low-income customers. The USCs will have units tasked to design pro-poor \nsubsidies that will enable all classes of customers to avail of the improved service levels in the \nDNI zones. Outside these pilot zones, water supply will be supplied at regular times to the \nconsumers and for longer duration. This water will be of higher quality since it will be filtered and \ndisinfected. While some contamination is inevitable due to intermittence of supply, the cost of \nhousehold treatment will be reduced. This improvement will result in time savings, improved \nhealth, and lower coping costs. It is estimated that some households spend about PRs400 \nmonthly on alternative water supplies, including for pumps, electricity, and water filtration.  \n \n21.  The reforms under the Investment Program are expected to have a positive effect on the \nTMA staff transferred to NSUSC. The deputation will allow for a transition without widespread \nretrenchment. The staffing of NSUSC can be rationalized over time through attrition. Deputed \nTMA staff will benefit from the incentive-based pay in NSUSC, as will selected TMA staff that \nmaintain liaison role with NSUSC (as planned under the compensation design). There will be \nbenefits  as  well  from  opportunities  for  training  and  knowledge  transfer.", "74  Appendix 13   \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis was prepared in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nguidelines.1 It examined the financial performance of North Sindh Urban Services Corporation \n(NSUSC),  the  core  implementing  agency  and  the  urban  services  operator  under  the  first \ntranche. The analysis includes projections of NSUSC\u2019s financial position, calculation of the \noperational and transition support funding requirement, and calculation of the financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR).  \n \nB.  Current Situation \n2.  The accounting systems at the taluka level are weak. Financial information on costs of \ndelivering water supply, wastewater management (WWM), and solid waste management (SWM) \nservices provided by taluka municipal administrations (TMAs)2 is limited. Most expenses are not \nproperly recorded or segregated by service. Tariff revenue covers less than 3% of operating \ncosts in first-tranche TMAs. The average annual cash shortfall for FY2003 to FY2006 was \nPRs185 million, largely comprising staff costs.3 The current structure of TMAs\u2019 urban services \nprovision  is  not  financially  viable.  Supplementary  Appendix  M  elaborates  on  financial \nmanagement concerns at the TMA level. \n \nC.  Methodology and Core Assumptions \n3.  The financial analysis, expressed in local currency and nominal prices, uses an accrual \naccounting-based financial model of NSUSC. The model calculates NSUCS\u2019s projected income, \ncash flows, and balance sheets. It estimates an FIRR for operations in first-tranche towns over \nthe  Investment  Program\u2019s  10-year  period,  from  FY2009  to  FY2018.  The  financial  model \nassumes NSUSC is responsible for operation, repair, and maintenance costs of the municipal \nassets, and it includes depreciation on municipal assets.4 Capital investment and operating \ncosts are adjusted for inflation. The assumptions used for modeling NSUSC operations in each \nsubsector are detailed in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n4.  The model assumes inflation of 13% in FY2009, gradually decreasing to 6%. Household \nwater consumption is assumed at 136 liters per capita per day, which is consistent with average \nwater consumption in the region. Current monthly tariffs of PRs10\u2013PRs30 are retained for those \ncustomers not residing in a distribution network improvement (DNI) zone. Those customers with \nsignificantly improved service in the DNI zones are assumed to pay upwards of PRs250\u2013\nPRs300 per month once improved services commence. The assumed tariffs for DNI zones \nremain lower than estimated willingness-to-pay values in Sindh, and they are comparable to \nactual costs of water from alternative sources. Collection rates are based on actual performance \nbut are assumed to improve over time. Similarly, nonrevenue water is assumed initially at 50% \nand to gradually decrease to 20% by FY2018. Electricity cost is calculated according to water \ndelivered, pumping pressure, and a unit cost of PRs7 per kilowatt-hour.

Results of Financial Projections for NSUSC \n5.  NSUSC\u2019s projected net loss before depreciation over the period ending with FY2012 is \nPRs776 million ($10 million), but NSUSC performance gradually improves as tariff revenue \nincreases with improved services (such as by the introduction of DNI zones under tranche 1).5 \nNSUSC is expected to cover its operating cash outflows from its own tariff revenues by FY2017 \n(Figure A13), assuming the Government covers deputed TMA staff costs.6 Cash flow coverage \nfor water supply services is reached in FY2013.

Operations and Transition Support Funding \n6.  The model estimates NSUSC will require funding of about PRs618 million ($8 million) \nunder part D of the Investment Program during its initial operating period from FY2009\u2013FY2012. \nOver the remaining 7 years and four tranches, the projected cash shortfall is PRs1.3 billion ($17 \nmillion).

", "76  Appendix 13 \nare assumed in these projections. Overall operating performance can be substantially improved \nover these projections if NSUSC can rationalize deputed TMA staff numbers and the skills mix, \nparticularly  in  SWM.  Of  over  1,800  current  municipal  service  employees,  some  75%  are \nsweepers and account for about three quarters of the deputed TMA staff expense.  \n \nF.  Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) \n7.  Basic assumptions used in computing the FIRR are as follow: (i) project investment \ncosts are derived from estimated costs less price contingencies and interest during construction; \n(ii) capital expenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred; (iii) interest and depreciation \nare excluded; (iv) real operating cash flows are used; and (v) residual value of asset additions in \n2018 are regarded as a benefit. The calculated FIRR for NSUSC is 5.2% (Supplementary \nAppendix G). This is higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 3.92% (Table \nA13.1). The calculated FIRR values for various scenarios are as follow: (i) 4.18% with a 10% \ndecrease in revenue, (ii) 4.32% with a 10% increase in costs, and (iii) 3.58% with a combined \n10% decrease in revenue and 10% increase in costs.

Tariff Assumptions and Affordability \n1.  Tariff Assumptions \n \n8.  Tariff assumptions are based on existing tariff schedules and on data from a recent \nwater supply willingness-to-pay (WTP) survey conducted in Khairpur, New Sukkur, Rohri, and \nSukkur.7 Regression analysis of the data set found a mean WTP of PRs566 per month and a \nmean WTP for a one-time connection charge of PRs3,620.  \n \n9.

Affordability Analysis \n \n10.  Applying  the  proposed  water,  sewerage,  and  solid  waste  management  tariffs,  the \npercentage of average monthly expenditure on these services was assessed with reference to \nhousehold incomes. Based on the available information, the median household income in urban \nareas of tranche 1 TMAs is estimated at PRs8,241 per month. At the start of the Investment \nProgram, the expected monthly charge for water will range from PRs10 to PRs30 per month \n(with no charge for other services), or 0.12% to 0.36% of household income. In fiscal year 2012, \nthe highest expected monthly bill, if all three services were included, would be PRs400 per \nmonth,  which  equates  to  4.8%  of  median  household  income.  This  is  below  the  generally \naccepted benchmark of 5% for affordability of utility services. Findings from the recent WTP \nsurvey, however, do show some variance in WTP levels between TMAs, necessitating user \ncharge schemes tailored to TMAs\u2019 needs. The WTP survey also highlighted, though, that some \nhouseholds in North Sindh pay in excess of PRs3509 per month for self-provision of water from \nwells and other sources, with Sukkur City households surveyed bearing monthly expenses of \nabout PRs525 for access to water sourced from wells. The Investment Program will support \nestablishment  of  a  low-income  consumer  unit  within  NSUSC  to  focus  on  adapting  pricing \nschemes and service provision to the needs of the urban poor. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nSindh Cities Improvement Investment Program (SCIP) is a 10-year, $300 million program under a multitranche financing \nfacility to fund basic urban infrastructure improvements in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns through (i) establishing local government-\nowned, professionally managed urban services corporations; (ii) support for urban sector reforms and capacity development; \nand (iii) priority investment in water supply, wastewater, and solid waste management (SWM) infrastructure. The investments, \nalong with institutional reforms and capacity development to improve service delivery, are consistent with the poverty \nreduction strategies of the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The country\u2019s Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper (PRSP 2003),a the 2005 Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF 2005\u20132010), the Vision 2030 \napproved in 2007, and the upcoming PRSP II together identify accelerating economic growth, improving governance and \ndevolution, human development, and targeting the poor and vulnerable as key to poverty reduction efforts. Improved water, \nsanitation, and health are recognized as core elements of human development. The MTDF prioritizes investments in several \nareas, including balanced rural and urban development, upgrading physical infrastructure, achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and supporting private sector development. All these are relevant for the SCIP. The PRSP-II \ndraft summary document confirms its alignment to this MTDF. The PRSP II itself \u201cpresents a strategy to ensure that the \ngrowth is broad-based and leads to effective poverty reduction.\u201d It focuses on (i) public-private partnerships for infrastructure \ndevelopment, (ii) urban and rural infrastructure as engines of growth, and (iii) improved service delivery. Again, all are \nrelevant to the SCIP. \n \nADB  is  finalizing  a  new  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132012)  focused  on  (i)  reforms  and  investment  in  major \ninfrastructure sectors, (ii) second generation reforms to strengthen governance and services to promote structural change, (iii) \ndevelopment of the urban and rural economy for balanced development, and (iv) effective implementation for development \neffectiveness and results. SCIP is fully consistent with this new strategy, as it introduces reforms, capacity development, and \npriority  infrastructure  investment  while  adhering  to  Government  of  Sindh\u2019s  and  national  poverty  reduction  priorities. \nImprovements in water supply, wastewater, and SWM infrastructure and services will positively influence health, education, \nsocial, economic, and environment outcomes. These are critical to achieving poverty reduction. Improved services will \npositively affect the health of young children, who disproportionately suffer from life-threatening water- and sanitation-related \ndiseases and benefit women whose time is spent caring for the sick and collecting water for households. The improved living \nenvironment will enhance the quality of life of all residents, having wider impacts on public and environmental health. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nSindh Province is Pakistan\u2019s second largest economy and second most populous province after Punjab. Its population is \nabout 36 million, and, since 2003, it has recorded average growth of about 7.0%.b The poverty headcount ratio has declined \nfrom 31% in FY2002 to about 20% in FY2007. Another source indicates poverty in Pakistan has declined from 34.5% in 2001 \nto 23.9% in 2005c in the wake of overall economic growth and increased pro-poor government spending. However, 70% of \nthe population remains vulnerable to poverty in the long run. The income and expenditure gaps between the poor and the \nwealthier strata have widened considerably. Poverty in Pakistan is now recognized not simply as an income-related \nphenomena but also being reflected in deprivation of key quality of life opportunities as well as feelings of vulnerability and \npowerlessness. The poor tend to have larger households and less access to essential assets and services, including \nelectricity, water supply and sanitation, and cooking gas. Poverty is clearly associated with landlessness and small land \nholdings, as well as lack of literacy and educational attainment. \n \nLarge-scale migration to Karachi has resulted in Sindh having the highest urban population, at nearly 50%, compared to 33% \nfor Pakistan as a whole. The evaluation of Sindh\u2019s constraints, opportunities, and development strategies needs to take into \naccount the urban-rural divide in the province. \n \nWhile urban Sindh, as a whole, is the least deprived area nationally, it is estimated that one fourth of these urban areas of \nSindh fall into the category of high deprivation (from a scale of low-medium-high).d This is indicative of the gap in development \nbetween Karachi (where 60% of the urban population lives) and other urban centers. Urban poverty in the subproject towns is ", "Appendix 14  79 \nmultifaceted, ranging from lack of employment to deficiencies in basic urban services, to substandard housing. The poverty \nlevels  of  towns  in  the  program  areas  are  around  40%\u201350%.e  Significant  disparity  exists  between  more  developed \nneighborhoods and the so-called katchi abadis (or slum areas). \n \nThe Investment Program will contribute to improved health and quality of life for the population of Sindh, in line with MDG \ntargets for access to improved water supply and sanitation. MDG7 (target 10) aims to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people \nwithout access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. SCIP aims to improve quality, continuity, and coverage of water \nsupply, wastewater, and SWM services by incentivizing and supporting effective management and sustainable financing of \nurban services providers. The Investment Program will have a indirect impact on poverty reduction and will support \ninstitutional reforms for improving the enabling environment for pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. \nThe targeting classification is deemed to be a general intervention. \n \n2.  Design Features \nPro-poor elements of the service provision are to be agreed between the taluka municipal administrations (TMAs) and the \nTMA-owned urban services corporation (USC) and will be set out in the service and asset management agreements between \neach TMA and the USC. SCIP aims to create proper incentives for improved basic urban services delivery and to establish a \nsustainable approach for providing these services. Pro-poor measures to be adopted include:   \n(i)  aiming for 80% coverage in poor communities and other service areas in general;  \n(ii)  establishing a specialized low-income consumer unit to expand access to the urban poor; \n(iii)  establishing  mechanisms  (subsidies,  exemptions,  or  payments  in  installments)  to  ensure  poor,  disabled,  or \nvulnerable households are not excluded from access by an inability to pay one-off, upfront connection charges;  \n(iv)  setting up mechanisms for holding the service provider accountable for service delivery to the poor;  \n(v)  developing a transparent method for setting connection fees and tariffs; and \n(vi)  ensuring consumers have a voice in service delivery through a properly designed complaint system. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nn/a \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nIt is estimated SCIP will eventually cover a population of around 4 million in some 20 TMAs. The first tranche of the program \nwill cover the urban population of a cluster of cities in interior Sindh\u2014Khairpur, Larkana, New Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, and \nSukkur\u2014estimated to be approximately 1,222,400 (based on the 1998 population census and with 3.2% per annum \npopulation growth from 1998\u20132008). The population is ethnically diverse. It is dominated by Sindhi, followed by Baluch, Urdu-\nspeaking Muhajors, and Punjabis. The remaining population is made up of religious minorities, including upper class Hindus \n(Lohana, Bania, and Thakurs), schedule cast Hindus (Bheel, Meghwar, and Kolhi), and Christians. Poverty is widespread. \nMost of the people living below the poverty line are landless, unemployed, and have very limited access to basic services.  \n \nAccording to Government statistics (footnote c), about 34% of the population in the program cities has access to tap water \nsupplies (varying from 18% to 73%) and around 77% has access to flushing latrines (varying from 57% to 92%). However, \nthese water supplies are intermittent (only 2\u20133 hours of service per day) and unsafe for drinking. Around 70% of the urban \npopulation of Sindh (including Karachi and Hyderabad) has access to underground sewerage and covered drainage systems \n(footnote c). In most participating towns, however, open drains are used to carry wastewater, including human excrement, at \nlane level. At main streets sewers carry wastewater up to sewage pumping stations. However, these systems suffer from poor \nmaintenance and are often blocked up with garbage. Only 38% of the urban population of Sindh (including Karachi and \nHyderabad) is served by municipal SWM services, a further 23% is served by privately run services,while the remaining 39% \nhave no service.  \nA social audit measuring the impact of decentralization on social services found only 23% of all respondents in urban and \nrural areas of Sindh were satisfied with government water supply. A project preparatory technical assistance socioeconomic \nsurvey found that 82% of respondents in katchi abadis and 41% of respondents in pacci abadis (or better-off areas) in \nKhairpur were dissatisfied with the current water supply. Ninety-one percent of households from katchi abadis and 84% of \nhouseholds from pacci abadis in this area were dissatisfied with the current sewerage system. Over 90% of all households \nwere dissatisfied with the SWM service. Surveyed households demonstrated a willingness to pay both initial contributions and \nmonthly charges for water supply, wastewater, and SWM services.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder consultations were held throughout the design stage in a total of 14 TMAs. At provincial level, several workshops \nwere held with provincial government departments, local government officials, community stakeholders, and nongovernment \norganizations. At taluka level, focus group discussions involved representatives of schools; labor, women, and religious \ngroups; and the business sector. The meetings were held to share information and solicit advice on reforms and investments \nand as to how SCIP can address their interests. A socioeconomic survey helped to augment information collected during \nconsultations, including willingness to pay for services. This consultation and survey covered seven TMAs across interior ", "80  Appendix 14   \nSindh (Badin, Dadu, Islamkot, Khairpur, Mithi, Nausharo Feroz, and Sanghar), areas considered for initial project-financed \nimprovements earlier in the design cycle. A stakeholder identification and consultation process was simultaneously carried out \nunder TA 4432-PAK: Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh to develop broad consensus on policies and \ntariff-setting for water, sanitation, and SWM services. Six TMAs were covered, and their case studies assess the water and \nsanitation situation in Sindh\u2019s interior cities. Support for investment and reforms in these services were welcomed by the \npublic in Johi, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, New Sukkur, Shikarpur, Sukkur TMA, and Umerkot. \n \nAs project preparation developed and the current design of SCIP emerged, additional consultations were held in North Sindh \nand tranche 1 towns. Taluka councils were consulted multiple times and passed resolutions to participate in SCIP. Public \nconsultations indicate broad support for the combination of reforms and investment. Further willingness-to-pay surveying was \ndone in 2008 following ADB guidelines.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making        Empowerment \n \nA program for public awareness and outreach will be carried out under SCIP. A strategy for public awareness, customer \nmonitoring, and customer care will be developed and implemented. For safeguards requirements, consultations will be carried \nout as set out under the safeguard plans and frameworks. Stakeholder consultations will be carried out for subsequent \ntranches of the multitranche financing facility. \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThere is no C&P plan, as development of consultation and participation activities will be carried out under component B of the \nadvisory technical assistance on public awareness. This will include further discussions with nongovernment and civil society \norganizations and other stakeholders. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \n \nPakistan ranks very low in the Gender Development Index of 2008 (152 out of 156 countries), and significant social and \neconomic gender inequalities exist. Women are disproportionately affected by unemployment, earn lower wages, generally \nhave no control or consent over the money they earn, and have limited access to credit. Despite women\u2019s legal right to own \nand inherit property, few women have access and control over these resources. Female literacy in Pakistan is around 38% \ncompared with 65% for men. Only 35% of females have completed primary education or higher, compared to 56% of men \n(footnote c). Labor force participation rates for all ages are 51% for men, compared to 29% for women. Participation rates for \nmen and women from age 30 to 50 are about 97% and 52%, respectively.f Seventy-three percent of urban expectant women \nhad prenatal checkups, and only 38% of urban mothers had a postnatal consultation within 6 weeks after delivery.  \n \nPrimary and secondary data have been analyzed to assess the status of women in interior Sindh towns. This shows gender \ngaps  in  employment,  income,  education  and  decision  making.  Women,  particularly  in  low-income  communities,  face \nmultifaceted poverty. While women in program towns are involved in a range of economic activities, including cotton picking, \nwheat threshing, sugarcane cutting, teaching, and employment in office jobs, they work primarily as homemakers. They \nspend several hours a day fetching, carrying, and storing water for household chores and domestic tasks, including preparing \nmeals, washing clothes, cleaning the house and latrines, etc. For this reason, poor quality water and unreliable delivery of \nwater supply services directly impact women. Lack of adequate sanitation facilities and garbage disposal services also place \nextra burden on women. The high incidence of water- and sanitation-related disease negatively impacts on women who are \nresponsible for nursing sick family members.  \n \nThe program will directly and indirectly benefit men and women in the participating towns of Sindh Province. Improvements in \nthe quality, coverage, and reliability of water supply, sewerage, and SWM services will have a particularly positive impact on \nwomen in program areas. As women are the primary users of these basic urban services, gender concerns will be \nmainstreamed  in  the  customer  complaint  mechanisms;  community  outreach  and  consultations;  public  accountability \nmechanisms; and urban service company governance. Women are key to raising awareness of safe hygiene practices, as \nthey are responsible for domestic duties and for developing safe and hygienic habits of children. A gender action plan will \nguide this mainstreaming. \n2.  Key Actions.

Islamabad. \n ", "82  Appendix 15   \nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.   Background \n \n1.  The Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program (SCIP or the Investment Program) is \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \nEach tranche of the MFF includes several subprojects to support the improvement of urban \nservice  delivery  in  selected  towns  of  Sindh  Province.  The  MFF  appraisal  will  include  the \nappraisal of the first loan tranche supporting urban planning, institutional reforms, program \nimplementation  support,  plus  complementary  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  urban  areas  of  Khairpur,  Larkana,  New  Sukkur,  Rohri, \nShikarpur, and Sukkur.  \n \n2.  The sanitary landfill subprojects under tranche 1 are anticipated to have non-severe land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. Three short land acquisition and resettlement plans \n(LARPs) and one land acquisition and resettlement due diligence report (LARDDR) have been \nprepared for three sites. No LAR impacts are anticipated for the water supply and wastewater \nsubprojects under tranche 1. The potential LAR impact of subprojects under tranches 2\u20135 \ncannot as yet be ascertained. However, subprojects will be similar to those in tranche 1 and \nsubject to the provisions of the LARF prepared for the Investment Program. ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) will not be triggered by the Investment Program. \n \nB.  General Procedures \n \n3.  LAR  measures  under  the  Investment  Program  will  follow  the  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of Pakistan and Sindh Province, as well as ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) and Operations Manual (OM) Section F2/OP & BP 2006. The appraisal of the MFF and \neach tranche and the approval of each subproject with LAR impacts will require preparation of \nthe following documents: \n(i)  The LARF for the MFF applicable to all subprojects. The existing LARF will be \nreviewed, if necessary, updated, and resubmitted for ADB and the Government\u2019s \napproval as a condition to approve each new tranche under the MFF. \n(ii)  The initial poverty and social assessment for each of the Investment Program\u2019s \ntranches,  indicating  if  LAR  impacts  are  likely  to  occur,  their  type,  likely \nmagnitude, and whether any indigenous peoples may be affected.  \n(iii)  For each subproject under a tranche requiring LAR, either a LARDDR or a LARP \nbased on detailed design. The LARDDR, to be prepared for subprojects where \nthe ADB policy on involuntary resettlement will not be triggered (para. 5), will \nprovide detailed information on how land has been acquired. The LARP, to be \nprepared when the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement is triggered, will detail \nthe compensation and/or rehabilitation plan to be implemented before civil works \nbegin.  \n \n4.  As per ADB policy and practice, the MFF, each tranche appraisal, and the approval of \nthe start of a subproject\u2019s civil works will be based on the following LAR-related conditionalities: \n(i)  The MFF and first-tranche appraisal: Conditional to the preparation of (a) a LARF \nfor the MFF acceptable to ADB, and (b) separate LARPs and/or due diligence \nreports for all subprojects requiring LAR included in tranche 1. \n(ii)  Following tranche appraisals: Conditional to (a) review and/or update LARF (if \nnecessary), and (b) preparation for each project with LAR of a LARP and/or \nLARDDR fitting the revised LARF. ", "Appendix 15  83 \n(iii)  Provision of notice to proceed to the subproject contractors: Conditional to the full \nimplementation of the LARP for each relevant subproject. Such a condition will \nbe clearly explained in the text of the civil works contract, including satisfactory \nrehabilitation of all private, communal, and public infrastructures that may be \ndamaged during the course of the subproject\u2019s implementation. \n \nC.   Land Acquisition Modalities and Application of ADB Policy \n \n5.  There are two modes for land acquisition available under the Investment Program: \n(i)  Mode 1: acquisition of unoccupied Government-owned land for a negotiated \nprice or agreed transfer arrangements between the parties concerned; and \n(ii)  Mode  2:  involuntary  land  acquisition  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894, \nthrough the provincial Board of Revenue and/or the district\u2019s land acquisition \ncollector (LAC) concerned.  \n \n6.  Mode 1 is adopted for the acquisition of land for facilities and neither requires the right of \neminent domain nor triggers ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Mode 2 is subject to the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  LARPs  as  required  under  ADB  policy  and  indicated  in \nsection D.  \n \n7.  Based on the above, ADB will approve the selection of subprojects with land acquired \nunder mode 1 based on a LARDDR clearly documenting (i) government ownership of the land; \nand (ii) evidence that the acquired plot is not rented, encroached, or encumbered.  \n \nD.  LARP Preparation and Implementation \n \n8.  Project-specific resettlement issues have been addressed to assist non-titled persons \nand bridge the gap between existing practice and the main guidelines of the ADB policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement. To reconcile inconsistencies between the Pakistan Land Acquisition \nAct  of  1894  and  the  ADB  policy,  the  Government  of  Sindh  has  drafted  a  LARF  for  the \nInvestment  Program  guiding  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  LARPs.  It  ensures \ncompensation at replacement cost of all adverse impacts and the provision of subsidies or \nallowances  for  affected  households  that  may  be  relocated,  suffer  business  losses,  or  be \nvulnerable or severely affected. \n \n9.  LARF Eligibility and Entitlements. The LARF determines the eligibility and entitlement \nof affected persons (APs), as outlined in the entitlement matrix in Table A15.

Institutional Responsibilities. As the Investment Program\u2019s Executing Agency, Sindh\u2019s \nPlanning and Development Department (P&DD) will have responsibility for overall strategy, \ntechnical appraisal, and provision of counterpart finances, including LAR finances. P&DD will \noversee the subprojects\u2019 compliance with the LARF through a program support unit (PSU). \nConcerning land acquisition and resettlement, the PSU will be entrusted with tranche appraisal \ncoordination,  interagency  liaison,  internal  monitoring,  and  finance  administration.  LARP \npreparation functions will be initiated by PSU until each urban services corporation (USC) is \nsufficiently established. Land acquisition and resettlement tasks within the PSU will be carried \nout by a qualified safeguards officer, reporting to the PSU program director. Under the first \ntranche of the Investment Program, the North Sindh Urban Services Company (NSUSC) will be \nestablished, and in the context of the Investment Program, will function as an implementing \nagency.1  \n \n11.  When NSUSC capacity for LAR is sufficiently established,2 NSUSC will assume from the \nPSU the LAR implementation tasks under Parts B and C of the Investment Program, including \nsocial and environmental safeguards tasks assigned to a safeguards cell within NSUSC or \nanother USC. The safeguards cell will be responsible for the preparation and implementation of \nall LAR-related tasks, including updating the LARF (if needed), preparing and implementing the \nLARPs,  carrying  out  liaison  functions  with  the  district  revenue  offices  and  other  relevant \ngovernment  offices,  handling  first-instance  compliance  and  grievances,  and  delivering  all \ncompensation and assistance for non-land, crops, or trees losses to the APs. The district officer \n(revenue),  as  the  LAC,  and  local-level  revenue  staff  (Mukhtiarkar  at  the  taluka  level  and \nTapardar at the tapa level) verify and validate LARPs and compensation rates and deliver to the \nAPs compensation for land, crop, and tree losses. Various provincial government line agencies \ndetermine compensation rates different from land. The office of the taluka nazim will play a \ncoordinating role and the elected taluka councilors will represent the rights of the local citizens \non grievance committees. \n \n12.  Disclosure and Public Consultation. APs as well as relevant government agencies will \nbe involved in consultations on APs\u2019 needs and preferences for compensation or rehabilitation \nmeasures. Key information in the LARF, including the entitlement matrix, will be translated into \nSindhi and disclosed to APs in the NSUSC, other USC, TMA, and local unions council offices. A \nSindhi  information  pamphlet  summarizing  the  LARP  will  be  provided  to  all  APs  requiring \ntranslation. An information pamphlet summarizing the LARF in Sindhi will be made available to \nthe communities. \n                                                 \n1  Under subsequent Investment Program tranches, similar urban services corporations (USCs) will be established \nand will assume the same responsibilities for LAR.  \n2  The NSUSC safeguards cell will be set up within the initial 3 months of loan effectiveness and supported \nintermittently by an international resettlement consultant. Social and environmental safeguards tasks will be \nassigned to this safeguards cell under the capital works unit, comprising two permanent staff experienced in land \nacquisition and resettlement and environmental protection. ", "86  Appendix 15   \n \n13.  Grievance Procedure. Initially, an aggrieved AP will address the safeguards cell of \nNSUSC or other USC, whose officers will strive for an informal settlement within 10 days from \nlodging of the complaint. If the complaint cannot be settled, the grievance will be referred to the \nGrievance Committee comprising the Mukhtiarkar and Tapadar of the relevant taluka and tapa, \nthe elected taluka councilor of the respective tapa, the Taluka officer infrastructure and services \nof the concerned TMA, the social safeguards officer of the safeguards cell of NSUSC or other \nUSC, as well as the social safeguards consultant hired under the Investment Program. Within \n30 days the committee will discuss the matter and refer land and crop compensation related \ngrievances to the LAC and/or district officer (revenue), or grievances pertaining to all other types \nof assets and incomes to the NSUSC or other USC safeguards cell, and obtain a resolution. If \nthe complaint still remains unresolved, it can be re-lodged by the AP within 1 month of the LAC \nor safeguards cell decision with the Grievance Committee, which refers it to the management of \nNSUSC, or subsequent USC. The AP must produce all relevant documents supporting his or \nher claim. The Management of NSUSC or other USC, will rule on the issue(s) within 21 days of \nits re-lodging with the Grievance Committee. The NSUSC\u2019s or other USC\u2019s decision must be in \ncompliance with the provisions of the LARF. If the grievance redress mechanism fails to satisfy \nthe aggrieved AP, he or she can submit the case to the appropriate court of law as set out in \nsections 18 to 22 of the Land Acquisition Act (1894). \n \n14.  Monitoring and Evaluation. NSUSC, or subsequent USC, assisted by the design and \nsupervision  consultant,  will  monitor  LARP  implementation  internally  and  report  to  ADB  in \nquarterly project implementation reports. An external monitoring organization will be tasked with \nexternal monitoring (once, if subproject LARP implementation is under 6 months, biannually \notherwise) as well as post-project evaluation. It will provide external monitoring reports as well \nas an evaluation report to the USC, P&DD\u2019s program support unit, and ADB.  \n \n15.  Finances and Schedules. The LARF mandates that each LARP will provide a detailed \nbudget and a schedule linking LAR tasks and disbursement of compensation with the initiation \nof civil works. \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples Issues \n \n16.  Indigenous  people,  i.e.  tribal  communities,  existing  outside  the  cultural  and  legal \nmainstream  of  Pakistan  society,  are  not  present  in  the  area  of  the  Investment  Program. \nTherefore, the ADB Policy on Indigenous People will not be triggered by the subprojects under \nthe Investment Program. \n \nF.  Specific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans \n \n17.  LARPs for tranche 1 have been prepared for the sanitary landfill sites at Khairpur, Rohri, \nand Shikarpur. An LARDDR has been prepared for the landfill site at Larkana.
