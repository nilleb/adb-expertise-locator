INTRODUCTION\n1. The Bank's medium-term operating objectives include the promotion of law\nreforms to facilitate the creation of a policy, legal and regulatory environment which is\nsupportive of economic growth. A key area of law reform given its central role in the\nbanking and financial sectors and its impact on foreign as well as domestic investment,\nis that pertaining to secured transactions.1\n2. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the importance\nof the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests in collateral to the legal\nand regulatory framework for meeting the credit demands of a market economy.2 As\nAsian economies become more market-driven, lenders and borrowers need market-\noriented legal and regulatory frameworks and methods of operation to reduce risks.\nSecured lending is one such technique. A recent study for the Bank revealed both this\ntrend and opportunities to improve further the security interest regimes in six major\neconomies of Asia.3\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Despite the large body of literature about secured transactions law reform,\nthere has been no recent and comprehensive survey of emerging trends in secured\ntransactions law reform in the region and no comparative empirical analysis of the ways\nin which secured transaction regimes affect key stakeholder groups in terms of the\neconomic efficiency of secured transactions. Actual and potential lenders and borrowers\nare key stakeholders because they have an interest in secured credit. The government\nis also a stakeholder because of its interest in the level of credit and credit risk in the\neconomy, not least because in a crisis the government itself may be called upon to\nrescue financial institutions with troubled loans. Lenders, borrowers and the government\nhave an interest in the economic efficiency of secured transactions in terms of better\nmanagement of credit risk, better access to credit and the lowering of transaction costs.\nAn economically efficient secured transactions regime lowers transaction costs,\nencourages lending and enhances investment through comprehensive availability of\ncollateral as a basis for secured lending and by a national computerized registration\nsystem providing public notice of security interests in property as well as easy, certain\ndetermination of priority among creditors with reduced reliance on the court system.\nFor the purpose of this PETA 'secured transactions or a security interest in a transaction means a\nlegal interest held by a creditor in property owned by a debtor or a third party, which entitles the\ncreditor upon failure of a debtor to pay or perform an obligation to take possession of the property\nand sell it in order to satisfy the obligation.\nSee the Bank's 1993 Symposium on Legal Aspects of Debt Recovery and Credit in Asia and the\nPacific; TA No. 2823-VIE: Secured Transactions Registration System Technical Assistance in Viet\nNam; see also Law and Development Bulletin, Vol. Ill, No. 1, April 1997.\nRETA No. 5665 Symposium on the Role of Law and Legal Institutions in Asian Economic\nDevelopment 1960-1995 which examined the People's Republic of China, Japan, India, Republic of\nKorea, Malaysia and TaipeiChina.", "2\n4. The experience of the selected ASEAN, South Asian and transition\neconomy DMCs is of great potential value in enhancing our understanding of current\ntrends in secured transactions law reform and of the economic efficiency of secured\ntransaction regimes. Certain aspects of their experience may provide important models\nfor improved access to credit and reduction of risk to all stakeholders (including\ngovernments).4 These need to be examined for purposes of broader application in the\nAsia-Pacific region.\n5. This regional technical assistance (RETA) seeks to examine systematically\nthe relationship between the legal framework for secured transactions and the actual use\nand enforcement of security interests by lenders and borrowers in India, Indonesia,\nPakistan, the People's Republic of China and Thailand. In evaluating the economic\nefficiency of secured transactions in these DMCs, the RETA will seek to illuminate the role\nof secured transactions in decisions to lend and borrow, and the role of the efficient\nsecured transaction regimes in lowering transaction costs, encouraging lending and\nenhancing investment. The RETA thereby intends to help shape future secured\ntransaction law reform in the countries of the region and future Bank programming.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n6. The objectives of the RETA will be to\n(i) analyze the secured transaction laws and their implementation in each of\nthe DMCs selected for the RETA study, including the legal regimes for the\ncreation, perfection and enforcement of security interests; the types of\ncollateral over which such security interests can be created; the impact of\nstamp duties, valuation practices and costs (such as notarial tees and\nregistration costs); procedural impediments to effective enforcement of\nsuch security interests, including the impact of court congestion; and the\navailability of legal substitutes for formal security interests;\n(ii) analyze the actual practice of lenders and borrowers in the use of security\ninterests in each of the RETA DMCs by considering the data from\ninterviews, questionnaires and aggregate sources, including the\ncircumstances in which lenders engage in secured lending rather than\nunsecured lending, the types of collateral actually in use, the comparative\nrole of substitutes for collateral (such as guarantees, sureties, post-dated\nchecks, etc.) relative loan pricing for secured and unsecured credit, levels\nof credit availability related to the prevalence of secured lending, and\ncosts of enforcement; and\nSee World Bank/AUSAID Land Titling Projeci in Thailand undertaken by the Department of Land\nAdministration of Australia (DOLA).", "3\n(iii) develop a comparative report, a broad strategy for secured transactions\nlaw reform for the RETA DMCs and recommendations on actions required\nfor implementing such reform and overcoming obstacles taking into\nconsideration:\n\u2022\t the findings of the RETA DMC studies above;\n\u2022\t secured transaction law reform models created by international\nbodies such as EBRD; and\n\u2022\t experience with secured transactions regime reforms in the Bank's\ndeveloped and developing member countries.\nB. Scope\n7. The countries that are to be the focus of the RETA's study are India,\nIndonesia, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China and Thailand. These countries have\nbeen selected because they represent a cross section of ASEAN, South Asian and\ntransition economies as a basis for a comparative study of the Asia-Pacific region.\n8. The components of the RETA will consist of:\n(i) five individual country studies in the selected DMCs which will present and\nanalyze the current secured transactions law regime, recent reforms to\nsuch regime and the actual operations of such regime based upon legal\nand banking research and empirical data and analysis drawn from\nstatistical sources and interviews;\n(ii) a preliminary comparative report based upon an analysis of the country\nstudies, on the experience of other countries (as drawn from the\ninternational literature on the subject) and model laws, and which will draw\na broad strategy for secured transaction law reform;\n(iii) a symposium to discuss the country studies, the preliminary comparative\nreport, individual country law reform strategies and future assistance. The\nsymposium will bring together key policy makers, senior government\nofficials, lenders, borrowers and the RETA research team; and\n(iv) preparation of the final comparative report for publication.", "4\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n9. The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $300000 as more fully set out\nin Appendix 1. The TA will be provided on a grant basis under the Bank-funded TA\nprogram. Funding will cover remuneration for the international consultants and the\ndomestic consultants; airfare and per diems for the international consultants and\ndomestic consultants; airfare and per diems for other participants in the symposium; the\ncosts of the symposium; and the costs of report preparation and publication.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n10. The RETA will require the services of about 6 person-months of a firm of\nconsultants which will be internationally recruited in accordance with the Simplified\nTechnical Proposal procedure and the Bank!s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nThe RETA will also require about 24 person-months of domestic consultants who will\nbe nominated by the international consultants. The domestic consultants will be\nrecruited in accordance with arrangements for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. The international consultants will have expertise in secured transactions\nlaw reform and design, and implementation and operation of computerized registration\nsystems for secured transactions. The international consultants will provide the team\nleader as well as at least one other international expert. The domestic consultant will\nhave expertise in domestic secured transactions law and empirical analysis involving\nthe key stakeholder groups. A minimum of two domestic consultants for each RETA\nDMC will be employed by the international consultants.\n11. The regional symposium, to be held in Manila, will be organized by the\ninternational consultants with the assistance of Bank staff. The Office of the General\nCounsel will administer the RETA.\n12. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 2.\n13. The RETA is to be carried out over a period of approximately 9 months.\nIt is expected to commence in March 1998 and be completed in November 1998.\nIV. THE PRESIDENTS DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $300,000 for Secured Transactions Law Reform, and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'OOO)\nItem\nA.\t International Consultants\n1.
