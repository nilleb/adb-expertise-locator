INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support climate finance \nbusiness development activities relating to climate-resilient agribusiness investments across 22 \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) members.1 These members were chosen because they are \neligible for support by the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), which focuses on climate-smart \ndevelopment planning and action. The TA will focus on investment opportunities that improve \nclimate resilience and gender equity within the agribusiness value chain, including agricultural \ninputs, farming, processing and logistics, and retail. The scope is consistent with the concept note \nADB submitted to the CIF\u2019s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) subcommittee.2 The TA \nwill involve some preliminary desk-based market analysis and preliminary screening of climate-\nresilient  and  gender-responsive  opportunities  based  on  existing  studies;  developing  an \ninvestment pipeline; preparing further funding applications and project structuring; and ADB \nprocessing. This approach is consistent with the scope for a knowledge and support TA activity \nbecause it involves a sector specific search for potential transactions and inputs for project \nconcept paper preparation. \n \n2.  In accordance with the Staff Instructions on Business Processes for Knowledge and \nSupport Technical Assistance,3 the director general, Private Sector Operations Department \n(PSOD) will approve this report.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which calls for \nADB \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d and \u201censure that 75% of the number of its \ncommitted  operations  (on  a  3-year  rolling  average,  including  sovereign  and  nonsovereign \noperations) will be supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2030\u201d and also that \n\u201cat least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations will promote gender equality by \n2030.\u201d4 The TA is also in line with ADB\u2019s Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024,5 which \ncalls for a focus on climate resilience in agribusiness. The TA complies with ADB\u2019s Climate \nChange Operational Framework, 2017\u20132030, which supports climate adaptation actions, with a \nfocus on building climate resiliency in agriculture.6  The TA is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy in the each of the 22 CIF eligible members (Appendix 3). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In Strategy 2030, ADB committed to prioritizing support for \u201cresilience and sustainability \nof countries, especially for vulnerable populations.\u201d ADB also committed to focus on \u201cadoption of \nadvanced technologies and climate-smart agricultural practices\u201d to promote rural development \nand food security. Additionally, Strategy 2030 specifies that ADB will support developing member \ncountries (DMCs) in \u201cdeveloping integrated approaches to adapt to climate change and improve \nclimate and disaster resilience\u201d and will \u201chelp DMCs increase agricultural productivity and reduce \npoverty by boosting farm and nonfarm incomes,\u201d including by promoting the use of climate-smart \n \n1  The TA is intended to support business development across all developing member countries (DMCs) that are eligible \nto receive funding from CIF. Those countries are Armenia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, \nKyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Papua New \nGuinea, the Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA is funded through the Strategic Climate Fund\u2019s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, approved in concept \nvia email on 2 July 2020. \n3  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nagricultural practices. Therefore, this TA would support a key operational area of regional \ndepartments and offer an opportunity for sovereign and nonsovereign collaboration. \n \n4.  Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are experiencing an increase in temperatures, \nunpredictable rainfall patterns, and an increasing number of extreme weather events such as \nfloods and prolonged droughts. These changes have far-reaching impacts on agriculture and food \nsecurity for growing urban and rural populations. For agribusinesses, these changes can seriously \nimpact productivity and profitability (or even viability) over the medium to long term. Thus, it is \nimportant that agribusinesses understand and anticipate these risks to their businesses and \nprepare accordingly by strengthening the resilience of operations and supply chains. It is also \nimportant that they can access any potential opportunities arising with climate change (e.g., new \nclimate-resilient high-value crops or crop varieties suitable to a given agro-climatic environment). \n \n5.  Current levels of investment in climate mitigation and adaptation in Asia are insufficient to \nmeet climate goals. ADB estimates that Asia will need to invest $1.7 trillion annually from 2016 to \n2030 to maintain current growth rates, including $200 billion annually related to climate change \nmitigation and adaptation costs.  Current annual investment is $881 billion, illustrating a significant \nshortfall in meeting needs.7 Climate change is already imposing significant costs on Asia and the \nPacific. Improving the resiliency of agricultural practices will help reduce the severity of future \nclimate impacts, particularly on vulnerable rural populations, while supporting a more sustainable \ndevelopment pathway (footnote 7). \n \n6.  Additional investment in women as agents of change for climate-resilient development is \nalso required.  The economic activity of women is highly concentrated in agriculture, and evidence \nshows that women are particularly adept at leading resilience strategies for climate-related shocks \nand stresses at the local level.8 In Strategy 2030, ADB prioritized investment to ensure equal \naccess of women to business opportunities and finance and expanding women\u2019s jobs, including \nin agribusiness value chains and access to finance.9 \n \n7.  Agribusiness financing is a growing and strategic sector for ADB. PSOD\u2019s Agribusiness \nInvestment  Team  (AIT)  is  providing  financing  (debt  and  equity)  and  TA  to  support  the \ndevelopment of companies along the agribusiness value chain, including in: \n(i)  inputs, through seeds, fertilizers, machinery, irrigation, and animal feed; \n(ii)  farming, through greenhouses, plantations, orchards, livestock, poultry, aquaculture, \nhorticulture, and grains; \n(iii) processing, through primary processing of food ingredients and secondary processing \nof packaged foods and beverages; and \n(iv) logistics  and  retail,  through  logistic  centers,  cold  storage,  food  distribution,  and \nsupermarkets.10 \n \n8.  AIT is aiming to increase the number and share of projects promoting increased climate \nresilience. Only 27% of AIT projects (6 out of 22) have had climate change adaptation features, \n \n7  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia's Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n10 Many of the agribusiness companies, especially in small and emerging markets, are likely to be involved in trade \nand/or recipients of foreign direct investment from abroad. This is aligned with pillar 2 (expanding global trade and \ninvestment opportunities) of operational priority 7 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration. \n ", "3 \nwhich represent only 5.5% of ADB\u2019s overall financial support to agribusiness. Similarly, 59% of \nPSOD-AIT projects (13 out of 22) have had gender-equality features, representing 41% of ADBS \noverall financial support to agribusiness. The TA will aim to develop the pipeline with projects that \nsupport climate-resilience and gender equality in agriculture, including: \n(i)  contract farming arrangements and providing increased knowledge of climate-resilient \nfarming practices and increased predictability of sales for smallholder farmers, with \nspecial assistance to vulnerable women farmers and small farmers from below-\npoverty-line households (e.g., use of information and communication technology to \nengage with or provide climate-resilient trainings to contract farmers, with consistency \nof farming techniques to prevent climate-related or other shocks and to improve yield \npredictions); \n(ii)  diversification to more climate-resilient crops, plant varieties, and processed food with \ningredients  that  are  less  sensitive  to  adverse  climate  events,  specifically  when \ncompared to climate related data or down-scaled weather information (e.g., research \nfields, selective breeding, gene banks, or partnerships with research organizations); \n(iii) climate adaptation features in companies\u2019 investments (e.g., irrigation, flood-resistant \ninfrastructure, and climate-controlled facilities such as greenhouses); and \n(iv) climate change adaptation and mitigation equipment, inputs, and techniques (e.g., \nenergy  production  through  biogas  digesters,  biomass  and  specifically  mitigation \nmeasures for agricultural waste burning, solar energy, animal feed reducing emissions, \nproviders of extension services, and suppliers of inputs or equipment). \n \n9.  Additional resources are needed to develop a pipeline of new climate-resilient projects \nand strengthen the climate-resilient focus in all projects supported by PSOD-AIT. The current \nPSOD-AIT, which comprises six permanent international staff (including one head and five project \nteam leaders), primarily focuses on the processing of transactions, including concept approval, \ncommercial, financial, environmental, and social and legal due diligence. Current resources are \ninsufficient to allow PSOD-AIT to actively develop a more climate-resilient pipeline of projects, in \nparticular in relatively small and frontier markets where business development is inherently more \nchallenging. The addition of a consultant dedicated to monitoring markets and identifying projects \ndisplaying  climate-resilient  aspects  at  early  stages\u2014in  particular  in  the  most  vulnerable \ncountries\u2014would considerably strengthen PSOD-AIT\u2019s climate-resilient project pipeline. PSOD-\nAIT also needs help to enhance the climate adaptation features of all investment and TA projects, \nas there are opportunities for boosting resilience of all agribusiness projects. \n \n10.  The TA will help address barriers, including the limited levels of private sector investment \nin climate-resilient agribusiness, particularly in the developing and middle-income countries \neligible for CIF support footnote 1). The TA will also prioritize investment in women as agents of \nchange for climate-resilient development.   \n \n11.  The TA will, where possible as determined by the results of a market gap assessment, \nprioritize investment in small and emerging markets and countries most vulnerable to climate \nchange as defined below: \n(i)  Fiji, Kiribati, Maldives, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and \nVanuatu;11 and \n(ii) Bhutan,  Cambodia,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic, \nMyanmar, Nepal, and Tajikistan.12 \n \n11 Classified by ADB as small island developing states, which are vulnerable to climate change. Kiribati, Papua New \nGuinea, and Solomon Islands are also classified by ADB as fragile and conflict-affected situations. \n12 Classified as group A countries by ADB. \n ", "4 \n12.  The TA will allow for an experienced consultant to be recruited on a full-time basis, for a \nperiod of about 3 years. The consultant should have significant experience in private sector \nbusiness development as well as transaction processing, preferably in agribusiness with a \ndevelopment impact and with pre-existing business networks in some CIF countries. Because \nbuilding cross-country sectoral expertise in a wide range of frontier markets and nurturing \nrelationships with potential clients take time, a relatively long-term commitment is important to \nensure the success of the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA will help address barriers including the limited levels of private sector investment \nin climate-resilient agribusiness in the countries (footnote 1). The TA is aligned with the following \nimpacts: (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; and (ii) promoting gender- and socially inclusive rural development \nand food security.13 The TA will have the following outcome: investment in climate-resilient and \ngender-responsive agribusiness expanded.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Internal climate resilience and gender and socially inclusive market gap \nanalysis and preliminary screening conducted. The TA will support a simple internal desktop \nmarket gap analysis to identify and assess climate resilient and gender and socially inclusive \nagribusiness financing needs, gaps, availability, and opportunities in all 22 CIF eligible DMCs \n(footnote 1). The study will also investigate the potential for collaboration between regional \ndepartments, resident missions, and PSOD towards Strategy 2030 operational priorities, and will \nconsult with regional departments and resident missions. The study will be an internal document \nto be used for business development purposes. This analysis will draw on existing studies and \nsources, as well as conversations with and facilitated by ADB resident missions in the 22 CIF \neligible countries, and seek to identify the most promising areas in the next 36 months for private \nsector investment. The results of this assessment will help prioritize business development \ndescribed in outputs 2 and 3 below (expected to comprise about 5% of the TA). \n \n15.  Output 2: Pipeline of potential climate-resilient agribusiness projects with gender \nadditionality developed. Based on the results of the market gap analysis, the TA will develop a \npreliminary pipeline of potential PSOD projects across the region. The TA will provide technical \nsupport to plan and prepare the investment projects, including preliminary due diligence and \nstructuring potential financing solutions (expected to comprise about 15% of the TA). \n \n16.  Output 3: Funding applications and project structuring and processing prepared. \nFunding applications or investment proposals would be prepared for submission to available \nsources of concessional finance (including ADB\u2019s bilateral blended finance facilities) and other \nsources of public and private finance, including ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (expected to \ncomprise about 80% of the TA). \n \n13 ADB. 2019.

The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nStrategic Climate Fund and administered by ADB.15 The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n18.  PPCR-funded projects, when administered by ADB, are subject to ADB\u2019s implementation \nguidelines. There are no additional requirements related to monitoring and reporting and no \nineligible and/or eligible expenditure items outside of those already adopted by ADB.  PPCR funds \nare disbursed on a pro rata basis. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will administer the TA. AIT will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants.
