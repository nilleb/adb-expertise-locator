INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness and efficiency of passenger railway operations. A Fact-Finding Mission visited \nthe PRC in June 2008 and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA project\u2019s \nobjectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 20081 country program for the PRC.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The annual growth of passenger transport was 9% and freight transport grew at 7.6% \nduring 1978\u20132006. Railways represent the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, and, \nin 2006, the modal split for freight ton-kilometers (km) was 47.5% for railways, 27.9% for inland \nwaterways and sea shipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. In \n2006, road traffic accounted for 52.8% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with 34.5%, \ncivil aviation with 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. \n \n3.  Rail is the primary mode of transport for long-distance and bulk transport in the PRC, \nand  rapid  economic  growth  has  resulted  in  an  accordingly  high  demand  for  railway \ntransportation. At the end of 2007, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised 78,000 route-km. The \nsystem annually carries about one third of the PRC\u2019s total passenger traffic and about one half \nof its freight traffic. Between 1978 and 2006, railway freight grew from 535 billion ton-km to \n2,172 billion ton-km, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 5.14%. Railway passenger traffic \ngrew at 6.65% annually in the period, rising from 109 billion passenger-km to 666.2 billion \npassenger-km. The average railway journey increased from 134 km in 1978 to 535 km in 2006. \nBy comparison, the average journey per passenger on roads grew from 35 km to 55 km over \nthe same period. For freight, the average railway haul was 770 km in 2006 as compared to \n65 km for road. Because of the spatial distribution of natural resources, processing plants, and \nproduction centers, railways will continue to play a major role in the transport sector. However, \ntheir capacity has lagged behind demand due to constraints in the railway system. Given that \nsystem\u2019s  important  role,  the  Government  has  adopted  an  aggressive  plan  to  improve  the \nrailways. It has planned network extensions and construction in the underserved areas having \ngood potential to use rail services.  \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system\u2019s capacity, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture local \nrailways to promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety \nof the existing system by using new technology and modern management tools in planning and \noperation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercializing \nservices, (v) initiating institutional and structural reforms to boost autonomy and accountability, \nand (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related services.  \n \n5.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new Railway Development Plan covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 100,000 km by 2020. \nIncreasing train speed is identified as a major goal. Priority will be given to developing railways \nin unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. The route \nnetwork length will increase by 16,000 km in the western region of the PRC to reach a network \nlength of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve operational efficiency, the Ministry of Railways (MOR) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2008. \n ", "2   \nhas initiated action to separate passenger and freight trains on key rail corridors. The estimated \ninvestments for the 2020 railway development plan are CNY2 trillion or about $300 billion. \n \n6.  The  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  of  the  Government  emphasizes  railway \ndevelopment and seeks to speed up railway construction. The plan envisages (i) constructing \n17,000 km of new lines so that the network reaches a total length of 92,000 route-km, and \n(ii) the length of the double-track lines and electrified lines reaching 45% of the network length. \nThe plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated passenger railway network by constructing 7,000 km of \ndedicated passenger lines, with Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan as the centers; \n(ii) develop coal transport corridors by increasing capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the \nrailway network in the poor western region (which will reach 34,000 km); (iv) build international \ncorridors  at  the  borders  in  the  southwest  and  northwest;  and  (v)  develop  a  countrywide \nintermodal  network  consisting  of  18  extra-large  container  terminals  and  36  medium-size \ncontainer terminals. A total investment of CNY1.5 trillion (CNY1.25 trillion for construction and \nCNY250 billion for rolling stock), or about $200 billion, is planned over the 5-year period.  \n \n7.  ADB is the lead lender in the PRC railway sector and has focused on the development of \nrailways  in  less-developed  inland  provinces  to  promote  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  ADB \nprovided 15 loans, totaling over $3.0 billion, to finance constructing about 1,921 km of provincial \nrailways and 5,541 km of national railway projects plus a sector-wide intervention for enhancing \nrailway safety on the PRC network. The World Bank has provided 12 loans, totaling over \n$2.9 billion, since 1984 for (i) 11 national railway projects to expand railway capacity on high-\npriority corridors, modernize system-wide technology, and strengthen institutional capabilities; \nand (ii) one local railway project. Japan has provided about Y578 billion for 15 railway projects \nsince 1979 to expand rail transportation capacity.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping to (i) expand the system by \nconstructing new lines in unserved, less-developed areas; (ii) modernize railways, enhance \nsafety, and increase capacity to improve efficiency on key routes of the national railway system; \n(iii) commercialize railway operations in order to sustain efficient operations; (iv) promote energy \nconservation and environmental sustainability; and (v) increase railway competitiveness in the \ntransport sector through restructuring and reform. The strategy will continue to focus on railways \ndevelopment in underserved areas of poor interior provinces to link lower-income regions with \ngrowth centers so as to facilitate pro-poor growth, a prerequisite to reducing poverty.   \n \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a significant component of ADB assistance to the railway \nsector, and it has effectively complemented the lending operations. Since 2002, there has been \nactive engagement in policy dialogue and discussion with the MOR, National Development and \nReform Commission, and Ministry of Finance, and there is broad agreement on reforms as an \nengine to further developing railways within the transport sector. Since 1989, 13 advisory TA \nprojects  totaling  about  $6.1  million  have  been  provided  for  developing  an  emergency \nmanagement  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network,  institutional  development  of  dedicated \npassenger lines and local railways, tariff and organizational studies for the Jing\u2013Jiu railway, \nenhancing commercial and business operations, marketing and business development, human \nresource development, and improving financial management and accounting systems.  \n \n10.  Even  though  the  PRC  railways  have  made  significant  progress  and  notable \nachievements in recent years, they are unable to meet the rising demand for passenger and \nfreight transportation. High economic growth rates and increasing urbanization are the two \nmajor factors driving the high transport demand. With gross domestic product expected to grow \nat 7% annually and reach $3,000 per capita by 2020 from the current level of some $1,700, and \n ", "  3\nas over 50% of the total population is expected to reside in urban areas by 2020, the challenges \nare enormous for increasing passenger transportation capacity and the quality of service offered. \nThe PRC railways face tremendous challenges in providing affordable, efficient, safe, and \nreliable passenger transport for the various segments of the society.  \n \n11.  Passenger transport on the railways has grown faster than the freight transport (between \n1978  and  2006,  the  growth  in  passenger  transport  was  6.65%,  against  5.14%  in  freight). \nPassenger transport also provides a better rate of return to MOR. Passenger transport accounts \nfor only 22.6% of the converted ton-km, but it contributes 36.6% of the combined total of freight \nand passenger revenues. Given the high demand for passenger railway transport, MOR has \ndeveloped a plan to develop 12,000 km of dedicated passenger railway network by 2020 at an \nestimated investment of about CNY1.25 billion. ADB has supported the concept of dedicated \npassenger  network  in  the  PRC  railways  and  is  financing  the  Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an  passenger \ndedicated line (PDL), the construction of which started in September 2005. Construction has \nalready started on a total of 17 PDLs and intercity railways totaling over 7,100 km. Developing a \ndedicated passenger network was a new concept for the PRC railways, and managing such a \nnetwork is different from running the conventional railway system that carries both freight and \npassengers on the same track. MOR had no experience in operating and managing such a \nnetwork and was therefore looking for international experience and best practices for managing \nit efficiently. ADB is providing TA2 to (i) prepare transportation plans for dedicated passenger \nrailway operations, (ii) prepare a sales and marketing strategy for MOR to adopt regarding the \ndedicated passenger lines, (iii) suggest appropriate pricing policies and a tariff structure for \nMOR\u2019s adoption, (iv) suggest an appropriate system for transport services that can be adopted \nby MOR, and (v) recommend a suitable decision-support system that MOR can adopt.  \n \n12.  Development of the PDLs is posing a new challenge that consists in their conflicting \nrelation to passenger operations on the existing mixed traffic lines (MTLs). Some of the PDLs \nare constructed by choosing the most congested sections of particular corridors, which means \nthe existing connecting lines bring the traffic to these PDLs. Also, a number of PDLs are \nconstructed in corridors where MTLs already exist in parallel and cater to both passenger and \nfreight traffic. Thus, these PDLs compete not only against such other transport modes as roads \nand aviation but also with the existing MTLs. The two types of lines have different business \nstrategies. PDLs are characterized by higher speeds, better service quality, fewer stops, and \nhigher fares as compared to the MTLs. In short, the two complement one another even as they \ncompete. Many other passenger railway systems in the world have faced similar challenges \n(e.g. France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom).  \n \n13.  MOR proposes to study the characteristics of the network passenger flow and analyze \nthe comparative advantages of the PDLs and MTLs. The aims are to (i) understand what \nchanges in train operation planning would be necessary when PDLs are put into operation, \n(ii) learn what are the target customer groups for PDLs and MTLs, (iii) identify what transport \nproducts could be designed separately for MTLs and PDLs, and (iv) study the system of rational \ndivision of labor in the PDL and MTL organizations in order to realize the full potential of the \nPRC railways in meeting passengers\u2019 diverse needs. Given this background, the Government \nand MOR sought ADB assistance to help the PRC railways research international experience \nand  prepare  a  strategy  to  enhance  railway  passenger  operations\u2019  efficiency  and \ncompetitiveness.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

The impact of the proposed TA is an affordable, sustainable, efficient, and competitive \npassenger railway transport system developed in the PRC. The outcome will be a strategy to \nenhance  the  efficiency  and  competitiveness  of  railway  passenger  operations.  The  TA  will \n(i) review the current practices adopted by MOR for managing passenger operations on PDLs \nand  MTLs,  (ii)  research  best  international  practices  and  experiences,  and  (iii)  recommend \nactions that should be realistic for the Government and MOR to implement. Appendix 1 gives \nthe  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  study  would  make  use  of  experience  in  other \nrailways and involve active participation of railway management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  International consultants, supported by national consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment  prepare  the  recommendations  and  a  plan  that  MOR  can  implement.  The \nconsultants will (i) undertake analytical review of the form and characteristics of the transport \norganization setup of PDLs and MTLs, (ii) review the transport demand for PDLs and MTLs, \n(iii) review the impacts of role division alternatives on providing passenger transport services in \nterms of service quality and affordability, (iv) identify the key issues for developing an optimal \nmodel  and  method  for  reasonable  role  division  and  coordination  of  transport  organization \nbetween PDLs and MTLs, and (v) make recommendations on optimizing usage of the PDLs and \nMTLs in order to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of railway passenger operations. \nThe TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the Government, MOR, and other relevant \nagencies. The study will build upon ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue and the outputs of the recent \nTA provided for policy reform support.3  \n \n16.  Key activities will include a review of existing studies by MOR, the Government, ADB, \nand  other  multilateral  institutions;  data  analysis;  and  consultation  with  other  stakeholders, \nincluding the Ministry of Finance and government officials. An international training program with \nparticipation from the relevant departments will be organized to learn from experiences of other \nrailways. Two workshops, one each at inception and at interim stage of TA implementation, will \nbe organized to discuss and review the study\u2019s findings, and a seminar will be organized at the \nfinal report stage to disseminate the TA\u2019s findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $640,000. ADB\u2019s TA funding program will finance \n$500,000  on  a  grant  basis.  MOR  will  finance  the  remaining  $140,000,  covering  office \naccommodation and the counterpart staff required to implement the TA.

MOR, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. A steering committee\u2014comprising representatives of MOR\u2019s relevant departments\u2014\nwill be set up to oversee implementation and provide guidance and direction to the consultants. \nIn addition, MOR will appoint a project coordinator who will supervise and coordinate day-to-day \nTA activities, including to monitor progress, resolve problems, arrange meetings, and liaise with \nconcerned government agencies. To facilitate the consultants\u2019 work and ensure that MOR \nbenefits from their experience, MOR will also provide adequate counterpart staff with relevant \nwork  experience  during  implementation.  Workshops  and  a  seminar  will  be  held  to  review \nfindings at the inception, interim, and final stages of TA preparation. A final report will be \npublished when the TA concludes. \n \n19.  ADB will engage a team comprising an international consulting firm in association with \nnational consultants using simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and \ncost-based selection method (weighted 80:20) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA will require about 14 person-\nmonths of international and about 17 person-months of national consulting services to carry out \nthe terms of reference (Appendix 3). The international consultants will have experience with \nsimilar assignments in the following fields of railway passenger transport: (i) transport planning, \nincluding knowledge of models, methods, and principles of transport segregation between high \nspeed and conventional railways; (ii) transport organization strategic management; (iii) pricing and \ntariff  policies;  (iv)  sales  and  marketing  strategy;  and  (v)  transport  services.  The  national \nconsultants will have expertise in railway passenger transport, including: (i) transport planning, \n(ii) sales  and  marketing  strategy,  (iii)  pricing  and  tariff  issues,  (iv)  transport  services,  and \n(v) management systems. The TA is expected to commence in February 2009 and be completed \nby September 2009. Procurement of equipment, supplies, and materials by consultants under \nthe TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nequipment will be turned over to MOR after the TA\u2019s completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.

Scope of Services \n \n1.  The impact of the technical assistance (TA) is to promote an affordable, sustainable, \nefficient, and competitive mode of railway passenger transport in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). To achieve this objective, the proposed TA will critically evaluate the quality and quantity \nof passenger transportation in the PRC and assist the Government and Ministry of Railways \n(MOR)  to  prepare  a  strategy  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  competitiveness  of  railway \npassenger operations.  \n \n2.  The TA will (i) undertake an analytical review of the form and characteristics of the \npassenger dedicated line (PDL) and mixed traffic line (MTL) transport organizations, (ii) review \ntransport demand for PDLs and MTLs, (iii) review the impacts of role division alternatives on \nproviding passenger transport services in terms of service quality and affordability, (iv) identify \nthe key issues for developing an optimal model and method for reasonable role division and for \ncoordinating transport organization between PDLs and MTLs, and (v) make recommendations \non optimizing PDL and MTL usage that will enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of \nrailway passenger operations. The study will make use of experience in other (international) \nrailways, involve active participation of railway management, and recommend actions and a \nplan that should be realistic for the Government and MOR to implement. The international \npassenger transport organization management specialist or passenger transport planner will be \nthe team leader. \n \nB.  Terms of Reference \n \n3.
