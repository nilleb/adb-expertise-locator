INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in Manila in \nDecember 2011, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB to \nprovide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to help the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection (MEP) in enhancing the environmental statistics institutional framework. This TA was \nthen included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for the PRC.1 In March \n2012, an ADB mission visited the PRC, and reached an understanding with the government on \nthe  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  costs  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Environment statistics describe the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the state and \nchanges of the environment, and their interaction with human activities and natural events. \nEnvironment statistics are integrative; they measure human activities and natural events that \naffect  the  environment;  and  they  monitor  the  impacts  on  the  environment,  and  the  social \nresponses to environmental impacts. It is an emerging statistical field in official statistics in most \ncountries  and  is  indispensible for  evidence-based  policies  and  decision  making to support \nsustainable development.3  \n3.  The  PRC\u2019s  environmental  statistics  system  was  established  in  the  1980s  and  has \nevolved significantly. The system quantitatively summarizes the PRC\u2019s industrial and urban \npollution protection and prevention, environmental management, and capacity development for \nenvironmental protection systems. The October 2011 State Council\u2019s opinions on \u2015strengthening \npriorities of environmental protection\u2016 emphasized the need to (i) improve statistics for the \nemission reduction monitoring and evaluation system, (ii) encourage implementation of the \nmajor pollutants\u2019 emission control, and (iii) establish an environmental information resource \ncenter that will enable environmental statistics and information works to meet higher standards. \nThese statistics play a big role in management and environmental protection decision making in \nthe PRC, which contributes to sustainable development.  \n4.  Pollution  sources  have  changed  markedly  with  PRC\u2019s  rapid  social  and  economic \ndevelopment. Environmental management approaches and requirements have also evolved to \nan extent where the existing environmental statistics system can no longer support them. The \ncurrent  system  for  environmental  statistics  is  unable  to  provide  sufficient  coverage  of  all \npollution  sources,  and  as  a  result  statistical  techniques  and  methods  for  environmental \nmanagement are still weak. The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan 2011\u20132015 emphasizes that the \nsupport for agricultural pollutants\u2019 control statistics is still insufficient, and that the application of \nenvironmental data and comprehensive analysis is quite weak, which makes it difficult to meet \nthe needs of policy analysis.  \n5.  ADB provided TA to the government in 2005 to help develop the regional supervision \ncenters (RSCs) of MEP (then the State Environmental Protection Agency).4 In 2009, ADB \nprovided additional TA on Strengthening Enforcement of Environmental Laws and Regulations, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

The TA workshops and seminars provided      \neffective fora to discuss the mandates, functionality, and staffing of the RSCs, while these RSCs \nwere being established through parallel government efforts. The proposed TA will build on the \nachievements of past ADB projects, and draw lessons from these TA projects to support MEP\u2019s \nefforts  in  improving  the  institutional framework  required to  (i)  improve  the  effectiveness  of \nimplementing the existing environmental statistics system, and (ii) ensure that environmental \nstatistics can be effectively used for supporting environmental management.  \n6.  Building on the key findings and recommendations of the past initiatives, the government \nrequested ADB to provide TA to help MEP (i) improve the institutional framework for the PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental statistics, and prepare a detailed action plan in this regard; and (ii) prepare \ntechnical guidelines on accounting methods for livestock-related pollutants. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.    The  TA  will  contribute  to  improved  environmental  management  and  sustainable \ndevelopment in the PRC by supporting the country\u2019s process of environmental statistics reform. \nThe expected impact of the TA will be enhanced environmental monitoring and management in \nthe  PRC.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  an  improved  environmental  statistics \ninstitutional framework in MEP.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Output  1:  A  review  of  international  experiences  in  environmental  statistics \nsystems and livestock-related pollution accounting approaches prepared. The TA will \nreview  international  experiences  in  environmental  statistics  and  reporting.  The  following \nsuboutputs will be produced as part of this output:  \n(i)  a summary of international experience in data collection, reporting, verification, \nquality  assurance  control,  data  application  and  analysis,  and  institutional \narrangements,  including  the  supporting  legal  and  policy  framework  for \nenvironmental statistics; \n(ii)  a summary of accounting methods for livestock-related pollutants from different \nAsian countries, with subsequent recommendations for the PRC\u2019s accounting \nsystem for agricultural pollutants; \n(iii)  a  review  and  synthesis  of  international  environmental  data  analysis  and \napplication, 6  and  environmental  statistics  management  from  major  Asian \ncountries,  resulting  in  recommendations  for  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  data \nanalysis and application system; and \n(iv)  a final report that incorporates suboutputs (i)\u2013(iii) and makes recommendations. \n \n9.  Output  2:  A  detailed  report  and  implementation  road  map  for  an  improved \nenvironmental  statistics  institutional  framework  in  the  PRC  prepared.

The  TA  will  also  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  road  map  for \nenhancing the environmental statistics system, and clarify short-term objectives and long-term \ntasks. The objective of this framework will be to outline the detailed procedures and steps for \nenvironmental statistics reform. The framework will address in detail the relevant technical \nstandards, regulations, and provisions for each step of the cycle of the environmental statistics \nsystem (i.e., from the preparation to its application for environmental management). The TA will \nproduce a policy brief summarizing the key recommendations for an improved environmental \nstatistics system in the PRC. \n10.  Output  3:  Technical  guidelines  on  accounting  methods  for  livestock-related \npollutants  prepared. Specific suboutputs related to the preparation of technical guidelines \ninclude  \n(i)  draft technical guidelines based on international and national experiences;  \n(ii)  detailed  accounting  methods  for  major  livestock-related  pollution  parameters \n(i.e., chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonia);  \n(iii)  detailed reports of  the pilot studies;  \n(iv)  technical training sessions on accounting methods for livestock-related pollutants \nand environmental data analysis and applications, with target groups to include \nlocal environmental protection bureau staff, and the management of selected \nlivestock farms; and  \n(v)  finalized  technical  guidelines  on  accounting  methods  for  livestock-related \npollutants. \n11.  The TA will implement the pilot project in selected locations (Ma\u2019anshan, Anhui Province; \nSanming, Fujian Province; and Zaozhuang, Shandong Province). MEP is developing detailed \ncriteria for the selection of pilot project sites. The pilot projects are anticipated to take about 6 \nmonths to be completed. The results of the pilot projects will form the basis for development of \nthe technical guidelines on accounting methods for livestock-related pollution. MEP will seek to \nestablish partnerships with city-level expert institutions when implementing the pilot projects.7 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and their \ntravel and per diem, office facilities, domestic transportation, workshop costs, administrative \nsupport, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from 1 November 2012 to 30 April 2014. \nMEP will be the executing agency. A TA management office will be established in the Foreign \nEconomic Cooperation Office (FECO)  of MEP to carry out day-to-day TA operations. The \ndirector of the Project Management Division 1 of FECO will serve as the executive director of \n                                                \n7  Partnership with relevant expert institutions will be established once the target cities for the pilot projects have been \ndetermined. \n ", "4   \nthe TA management office responsible for coordinating day-to-day operational matters among \nADB, consultants, and related government agencies.  \n \n15.
