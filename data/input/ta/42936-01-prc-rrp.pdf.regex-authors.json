", "THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nequity investment in Tongfang (Harbin) Water Engineering Co., Ltd. (TVVE), and (ii) a proposed \nloan to TVVE for the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project \nPrivate Sector Facility in the People's Republic of China (PRC). TVVE will use the proceeds of \nthe proposed equity investment and loan to finance its portfolio of water supply and wastewater \ntreatment subprojects in Heilongjiang province, the PRC. If approved, the project will constitute \nthe 27th private sector investment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the PRC. \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  The project is considered the latest component of the assistance program that ADB has \nbeen providing to the Songhua River Basin (SRB) with regard to water supply and wastewater \ntreatment since the successful ADB technical assistance (TA) project in 2002.1  Most of the \nsubprojects that the project will cover are linked to the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution \nPrevention and Control Master Plan (SRBPCMP), to which the TA has provided substantial \ninputs. In 2003, when the TA was implemented, ADB's public sector and private sector \noperations formed an in-house partnership and started to apply joint efforts to address the \nenormous funding requirements in the potential projects being identified. \n3.  ADB started discussions with TVVE in the seminar conducted by ADB (a joint activity of \nthe PRC Resident Mission and ADB Private Sector Operations Department [PSOD]) in July \n2007. All TVVE's subprojects have common impacts, which are to improve the urban \nenvironment and enhance the quality of life in Heilongjiang province, and to contribute \nsignificantly to pollution control in the SRB. ADB identified TWE as a proper private sector \nvehicle to tackle the water concerns in the SRB and contribute to the implementation of the \nSRBPCMP, in which ADB public sector operations already play a significant role. \nB.  Sector Background \n1.  People's Republic of China Wastewater Sector \n4.  The PRC initiated market-oriented economic reforms in 1978, and since then rapid \nurbanization has accompanied high levels of economic growth. Policies to open the country to \ninternational trade and investment have made the PRC one of the world's fastest-growing \neconomies. Gross domestic product in 2008 was CNY30,067 billion, compared with CNY362.4 \nbillion in 1978. Per capita gross domestic product in 2008 was CNY24,640. The country has \nreached the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of cutting the 1990 poverty rate by half, and \nis on track to reach most of the other MDGs. In the process, the PRC's urban population has \nmore than tripled, from 190 million in 1980 to 607 million in 2008, accounting for 45.7% of the \nnational population, and is expected to reach 47.0% by 2010, 50.0% by 2015, and 55.0% by \n2020. This represents the largest and most rapid rural\u2014urban migration in global history and \nunderstandably presents numerous challenges to policy makers, urban planners, and those \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of urban services. \n1 \nADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \nControl Management. Manila. ", "2 \n5. Rapid urbanization in the PRC has taken a severe toll on the environment, and has also \nchallenged the capacity of local governments to promote good governance, effective planning \nand management, sustainable financing, and timely delivery of public services. While significant \nprogress has been made in building urban infrastructure over the past two decades, it tends to \nbe concentrated on the more highly developed eastern and southern coastal plains. The \nexpansion and upgrading of public services has not kept pace with rapid industrial growth. The \nmigration to urban centers currently taking place in the inland regions (in response to \ngovernment policies to promote economic development and job creation in these areas) is \nputting a further strain on urban infrastructure and services. \n6. Cities in the north and west of the PRC and around the SRB are experiencing \nwidespread pollution caused by the discharge of untreated wastewater. Shortages of safe \ndrinking water are also common, particularly in the north of the PRC. The government has \nclassified more than 108 cities as having serious water problems, and 60 as being critically \nshort of water. The situation has been exacerbated by the pollution of raw water sources by the \ndischarge of inadequately treated agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewater. \n7. According to latest figures mentioned in the 2008 China Environment Status Report, 2  \n65% of the national annual total wastewater generation, equivalent to 57.2 billion tons (t) per \nyear, was treated. The annual total chemical oxygen demand discharge was 13.207 million t (a \ndecrease of 4.4% from 2007 levels) and that of ammoniacal nitrogen discharge was 1.27 million \nt (a decrease of 4.0% from 2007 levels). These reductions in pollution are results of increased \nefforts mainly in point source pollution interception and treatment. Despite these welcome \ndevelopments, water quality improvement is still slow in most of the country's surface waters \nand groundwater sources that have become polluted to unacceptable levels. In 2008, the \nMinistry of Environment's river water quality monitoring results disclosed that approximately \n45% of the 200 major rivers had a water quality of less than class IV or V. 3  Eutrophication due to \nnutrient pollution has occurred frequently in many of the PRC's lakes. Water quality is \nconsidered adequate in only 72% of the 222 surface drinking water sources serving 113 major \ncities, and approximately 90% of urban water bodies are polluted. Major pollution sources are \nfrom urban sewerage as well as nonpoint sources of pollution. The World Bank estimates the \nPRC's annual economic losses due to pollution-related water shortages amount to about \n0NY147 billion. \n2.  Songhua River Basin \n8. The SRB is the third-largest river basin in the PRC, after the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. It \nhas an area of 557,000 square kilometers (km2) and a population of 62 million. Agriculture is \nwell developed and there is a large industrial base. The Songhua River catchment covers \nportions of three provinces and one autonomous region\u2014Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning \nprovinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. About 48.4% of the catchment is \nlocated in Heilongjiang province (covering 59.4% of the provincial territory), 24.1% in Jilin \nprovince (71.6% of the provincial territory), 27.4% in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \n(12.9% of the autonomous regions territory), and 0.1% in Liaoning province (0.36% of the \nprovincial territory). The Songhua River has two headwaters: in the west, the Nenjiang River, \nwhich originates from Yilehuli Mountain of the Greater Hinggan mountain range; and in the \n2  Government of the People's Republic of China. Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2008. Annual State of the \nEnvironment Report. Beijing. \nPRC water quality standards have five classes of quality covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is pristine, \nwhile class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water \nsupply. ", "3 \nsouth, the Second Songhua River, which originates from the Heavenly Lake on top of the \nChangbaishan Mountain. The two rivers converge at Sanchakou (at the border of Heilongjiang \nand Jilin provinces) to form the Songhua River which joins the Heilongjiang River, enters the \nRussian Federation, and eventually discharges to the sea. \n9. The SRB is seriously polluted and is acknowledged by the government to be one of the \nfour most polluted river basins in the PRC. Water pollution in the SRB, especially in relation to \nthe protection of drinking water resources for the municipality of Harbin, has received increased \nnational and international attention following a widely publicized pollution incident in the SRB in \nNovember\u2014December 2005. The Songhua River is contaminated with a number of known and \nsuspected trace organic chemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants. It is classified by the \ngovernment as class IV in some sections of the Songhua River (and even falls into class V \nduring the 6-month low-flow winter season), and is considered unsuitable for municipal domestic \nwater use. In March 2003, ADB approved the Harbin Water Supply Project ($100 million)4  to \naddress the needs of Harbin City, with a population of 3 million, for clean and reliable drinking \nwater from an alternative water source (the Lalin River), since the existing source from the \nSonghua River was highly polluted. \n3.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n10. Key problems and opportunities include (i) shortage of good quality drinking water; \n(ii) inadequate wastewater treatment capacity and inefficient operation; and (iii) insufficient \ninvestment, particularly through private sector participation, in the sector. A key element for \nsuccess in accelerating the achievement of MDG target 10 is the development of bankable \nprojects, which are able to leverage government funds and raise the balance of the investment \ncapital required from other sources, including commercial and development banks and the \nprivate sector. \n11. Reducing the pollution of rivers and lakes and improving the supply of clean drinking \nwater is part of any pro-poor development strategy. Poor people are most vulnerable to \nenvironment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical attention \nfor digestive tract ailments associated with drinking polluted water. The pollution of rivers and \nlakes reduces already scarce drinking water sources. Bottled water is a very expensive \nalternative to potable tap water. The financial burden of buying bottled water falls most heavily \non the poor and can account for a disproportionately high proportion of their limited income. \nMuch remains to be done to reduce the adverse impacts of water pollution on the poor and to \nend shortages of clean drinking water. \n12. The responsibility for developing water infrastructure falls on local municipalities. \nHowever, funding for water infrastructure in municipalities in underdeveloped areas, such as the \nSRB, is limited, mainly because (i) they are constrained by limited financial budgets and overall \ninfrastructure needs, (ii) they do not have direct access to multilateral or other external financing \nsources, and (iii) some municipalities may not be able to meet the government's counterpart \nfunding requirements. Private sector funding is clearly needed for both the water supply and \nwastewater treatment sectors. Private sector participation can also lead to more use of new \ntechnology and enhance efficiency. \nADB. 2003.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople's Republic of China for the Harbin Water Supply Project.  Manila. The project districts are receiving the new \nhigh quality of water. ", "4 \n13. In the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP), the government prioritized environmental issues, \nincluding water and air pollution, through policy reform, more investment, and better urban \ninfrastructure management. Recognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution \ncontrols are essential for sustainable economic growth, the government has incorporated \nenvironmental protection as a national priority in its development strategy. In addition to \nenacting environmental protection laws and implementing regulations that emphasize \npreventive measures, the polluter-pays principle, and decentralized environmental management, \nthe government has also undertaken numerous programs, including for wastewater \nmanagement.8  The government has decreed that, by 2010, the wastewater treatment rate in all \ncities of the PRC should not be lower than 60%, and that it should not be lower than 70% for the \nmajor cities' with secondary treatment facilities. The treatment level required is dependent on \nthe water environmental functions or quality class of the receiving water body. To achieve water \nquality class I, II, or III, secondary wastewater treatment would normally be required. \n14. The government's strategy focuses on (i) developing water sources; (ii) protecting \nexisting sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; (iii) introducing water-efficient \ntechnologies and operations; and (iv) using appropriate pricing mechanisms to encourage \nconservation and generate necessary funds for operation, maintenance, and investment. The \ngovernment's ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that all water supply \nand wastewater projects be financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \n15. The government is focusing more attention on improving water quality in the SRB during \nthe current FYP and the next two FYPs. The PRC top leadership has expressed strong support \nfor pollution reduction and water quality improvement in the SRB, and the overall target is to \nensure that water quality in the SRB meets the PRC class III water quality standard by 2020. \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n16. The project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020,8  which identified infrastructure and \nenvironment as two of the five core areas in which ADB will employ its financial and institutional \nresources to maximize results, efficiency, and impact. To contribute to public health, in urban \ninfrastructure ADB will focus on water supply, sanitation, and waste management. ADB \ninvestment in infrastructure is fundamental to achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth, \nand can also contribute to environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Under \nStrategy 2020, ADB's infrastructure operations will emphasize public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs) and private sector engagement. ADB will promote a larger role for the private sector in \nfinancing infrastructure, either as a project sponsor or as an institutional bond or equity investor. \nThe equity investor role carries great promise for augmenting the supply of capital for \ndeveloping infrastructure in the region. In another core area\u2014environment\u2014ADB will assist \nThe PRC Water Prevention and Control Law was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law was enacted \nto prevent and control water pollution, protect and improve the environment, safeguard human health, and ensure \neffective utilization of water resources. The law also establishes standards for water environment quality and for \ndischarge of water pollutants and enumerates the planning. supervision, and management of the prevention and \ncontrol of water pollution. \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China.

", "5 \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) and their municipalities address a range of environmental \nproblems resulting from rapid urbanization. \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n17.  The project is in line with ADB's country strategy and program in the PRC, 9  which has \nimproving the environment as one of its five priority areas of focus. The project reflects the \ninfrastructure focus of ADB's private sector operations in the PRC. In the infrastructure sector, \nADB prioritizes pioneering projects with bankable contractual and financial structuring to \nencourage private sector participation and enhance management expertise. The proposed \nproject is a supplementary private sector facility of the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution \nControl and Management Project,1\u00b0  which was approved by ADB on 11 December 2008. The \ntwo ADB projects are trying to create a new, comprehensive PPP model, which is replicable in \nthe water sector or other urban infrastructure-related businesses in the PRC and other DMCs. \n3.  Consistency with the Water Policy \n18.  The project is consistent with ADB's Water Policy11  and the Water Financing Program \n2006-2010. 12  In response to the huge unmet water needs in Asia and the Pacific, and \n13 \nconsistent with the recommendations of various international initiatives   to double water \ninvestments, ADB has made water a core business area and envisages doubling its water \ninvestments to more than $2 billion annually.14  \n4.  Consistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n19. During the processing of the Harbin Water Supply Project, ADB held extensive \ndiscussions with the government on addressing pollution control in the SRB. Consequently, in \n2002 ADB provided TA for water quality and pollution control management in the SRB. \n20. The TA project, which was highly successful,  15  had the following impacts: First, it \ndeveloped a long-term vision for the SRB, consisting of a strategic plan identifying water quality \nobjectives, targets and reforms, and the strengthening of the existing river basin and pollution \ncontrol management practices, and proposed a long-term physical investment program. Second, \nit  strengthened the capacity of key organizations responsible for pollution control and \nmanagement at both the river basin and regional level, and prepared a road map outlining the \nkey milestones leading to the development of a river basin management framework within the \nPRC. Third, it identified knowledge gaps relating particularly to nonpoint sources of pollution, \nwater quality assessment (notably micropollutants), and water quality inventories. Fourth, it \n9 \nADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People's Republic of China. 2008-2010. Manila. \n10\nADB. 2008.

The \nstrategic plan includes the identification of an investment plan to be implemented over 15 years. \nFifth, it assisted the government to develop a long-term water pollution control plan for the SRB \nbeyond 2010, and provided strategic policy inputs to the 11th FYP and the SRBPCMP. The \nSRBPCMP (2006-2010), approved by the State Council on 29 March 2006, is an action \nprogram to set pollution control targets for the SRB for 2006-2010, requiring that urban \nenvironmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. Untreated wastewater is \na major problem in the SRB, and the SRBPCMP specifies that the wastewater treatment rate in \nlarge and medium-sized cities should not be less than 70% by 2010. The significant increase in \nwastewater treatment capacity under the proposed project would contribute to the target of \nimproving the water quality in the SRB from the current class IV and class V to class III by 2020. \n21. The Jilin Water Supply and Sewerage Development Project 16  ($100 million), approved in \n2005, was the first major ADB investment directly addressing pollution control in the SRB. The \nJilin Urban Environmental Improvement Project 17  ($100 million), approved in 2007, was the \nsecond, and it follows the priority list of the SRBPCMP. The Songhua River Basin Water \nPollution Control and Management Project ($200 million) was the third major ADB investment in \nthe SRB, and it also follows the priority list of the SRBPCMP. The proposed project will be the \nfourth ADB investment, and the first private sector operation, complementing the previous public \nsector operations in the SRB. This comprehensive strategic approach to addressing pollution \ncontrol in the SRB will serve as a model for demonstration and replication elsewhere in the PRC \nand other DMCs. The proposed project will help the concerned counties and cities in \nHeilongjiang province to achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2012. Key areas for \nreplication include (i) the approach to studying the complex issues of SRB water quality and \npollution control management; (ii) the river basin approach to managing water quality; \n(iii) the strategic pollution control action plan, which combines technical assessment, identifying \ninvestments on a prioritized basis, and institutional planning; (iv) prioritized investments and \nrelated capacity building; and (v) PPP. \n22. Underdeveloped wastewater collection and wastewater treatment has led to the \ndischarge of untreated wastewater into local rivers, and eventually to the pollution of the SRB. \nWater quality in some sections of the Songhua River and its tributaries does not meet class V of \nthe PRC surface water quality standard. The lack of adequate wastewater management \ndegrades local rivers, poses a threat to public health, and adversely affects the quality of life in \nthe SRB. There is an urgent need to expand the sewer network and wastewater treatment \ncapacity. In accordance with the SRBPCMP, local governments have identified the prioritized \nprojects, to be funded by the public sector or the private sector, or jointly. \n23. The proposed project builds on and furthers ADB policy dialogue with the government in \nseveral key areas, including (i) cost recovery and tariff reform, (ii) wastewater management, (iii) \nupstream and basinwide pollution prevention and control, (iv) water conservation, (v) corporate \ngovernance and enterprise reform, and (vi) private sector participation. The cost recovery \nregulations are stipulated in the national guidelines on water supply and wastewater treatment. \nADB has supported the water tariff reform process through two water tariff TA projects 18  with the \n16 ADB. 2005.

The water tariff TA projects (i) \nstrengthened the financial sustainability of municipal water supply companies; (ii) piloted \nimplementation of the national guidelines in the selected case study cities of Chengdu, Fuzhou, \nand Zhangjiakou; and (iii) recommended financial regulations for water supply companies and \ndesigned nationwide training programs. The NGWT requires water supply companies to adopt \nfull cost recovery as their main objective when they set water tariffs. The full cost-recovery \nformula for water tariffs also includes a return on equity to attract private investors. The NGWT \nis being implemented nationwide. In 2002, ADB provided a TA project on Preparing the National \nGuidelines for Urban Wastewater Tariffs and Management Study.19  The TA was completed in \n2003 and assisted the government to refine the wastewater tariff principles, develop national \nguidelines for wastewater tariffs, and improve urban wastewater management. ADB is also \nsupporting the government to develop national policy frameworks for wastewater and solid-\nwaste tariffs, including tariff calculation methodologies focusing on small cities and towns. 2\u00b0  \n24.  ADB has also provided TA support to the government on the use of market-based \ninstruments to enhance private sector partnership in public utilities, mainly for water supply, and \nwastewater.21  This TA analyzed the issues in the context of international best practices and how \nthese could be adopted in the PRC. ADB conducted a seminar (a joint activity of the PRC \nResident Mission and PSOD) in Beijing on 25 July 2007 on ADB's nonsovereign lending \noperations for the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. \nIII.

The project, which provides for an equity investment and loan by ADB, will support the \nexpansion and capital expenditure plan of TVVE to build, rehabilitate, expand, upgrade, privatize, \nand/or operate water supply and wastewater treatment facilities in the SRB the PRC. \n1.  The Sponsor and Borrower \na.  Sponsor \n26.  The project sponsor is Tsinghua Tongfang Co., Ltd. (TTC), a reputable listed company \nheadquartered in Beijing. TTC was established by the renowned Tsinghua University in 1997, \nby merging several businesses owned by the school. TTC went public in the same year, and \nlisted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Tsinghua University, through Tsinghua Holdings Co., \nLtd., is still the largest single shareholder of TTC. \nb.  Borrower \n27.  TVVE was established in May 2004 for the purpose of TTC's first, and still the largest, \nsanitation investment\u2014the Harbin Taipin Wastewater Treatment Plant with a capacity of \n325,000 t/day. \n19 ADB. 2001.

In 2006, TVVE, with strong support from TTC, entered into a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG) to undertake certain tasks \ndefined in the SRBPCMP, after it successfully built and commissioned the Harbin Taipin \nWastewater Treatment Plant. TTC's funding capacity and TVVE's technical strength, \nconstruction and operation experience, and investment structuring strategy are well recognized \nby the local governments, and in turn help TVVE to develop the market in Heilongjiang. \n2.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n29.  The project will enhance the urban environment and improve public health and the \nquality of life for urban residents in the project cities and counties in Heilongjiang province. This \nwill be achieved by expanding wastewater treatment coverage and improving the supply of \npotable water. The outcome of the project will be reduced pollution and improved water supply \nand wastewater management, through PPP, in the SRB. \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n30.  One of the key development impacts of the project will be to expedite the delivery of \nurban water supply, sanitation, and wastewater services in the PRC, and thereby accelerate the \nachievement of MDG target 10 in the PRC. The shortage of clean drinking water sources and \nwater pollution are threatening public health and the economic growth of the country. \nInvestments in wastewater treatment will improve the environment and help arrest pollution of \nwater sources, facilitating delivery of water that meets national standards and reducing threats \nto public health. Poor people tend to suffer the most economically from increased medical costs \nor loss of income as a result of waterborne diseases. An increase in the water supply will enable \nincreased industrial output, among other benefits. Access to piped water supply increases \nproductivity by eliminating time spent in fetching and queuing for water\u2014time which can now be \nchanneled to other productive activities. Investments in water and wastewater will reduce these \ncosts and contribute to improving the living conditions of the poor and promoting inclusive \neconomic growth. \n2.  Private Sector Development \n31.  The project will promote private sector participation in urban water supply, sanitation, \nand wastewater management in the PRC, and thereby increase the amount of private capital \ninvested in the urban water sector. This is crucial for the sustainable and efficient delivery of \nbasic services as the resources available within government, especially at the local level, are \nlimited. The project has a strong demonstration effect on PPP, and will establish a precedent in \nmeeting huge funding requirements in environment protection. The project, together with other \nrelated ADB sovereign operations, provides a good example of how the government and ADB \ncan mobilize sufficient resources\u2014from sovereign, quasi-sovereign, multilateral, bilateral, \ndomestic private sector, foreign government, and foreign investors\u2014to address a common \ndevelopment concern and jointly work on a sustainable solution. ", "9 \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Holding Company \n32. TVVE, after attracting strategic investments from ADB and other investors, will focus on \ndeveloping water supply and wastewater treatment facilities in the SRB. \n33. TVVE will maintain the current business strategies and procedures, with support from \nADB for environmental and social safeguards management. \n2.  Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Subprojects \n34. TVVE sets up different project companies, which are all wholly owned, or effectively \nwholly owned, by TWE, to manage various water supply and wastewater treatment subprojects \nin different cities in Heilongjiang province. Each subproject will be one type of PPP with the \nrelevant local government, such as build\u2014operate\u2014transfer for one VVVVTP, or privatization of \nexisting water supply facility in a particular area. The project developer is selected through \neither public tendering or bilateral negotiation with underlying competitive selection. For any \ngreenfield subproject, the feasibility study, environmental impact assessment, and project \ndesign are prepared by the project developer and approved by local government. Each \nsubproject is implemented in accordance with granted approvals, and during construction and \noperation is subject to government inspections on various aspects, including environment, \nsafety, quality, and sanitation. \n35. The inflow and outflow volumes are metered with minimum offtake quantities in all the \nsubprojects. The qualities of inflow and outflow are monitored on a real-time basis, 24 hours a \nday, by the local environmental protection bureaus through remote testing equipment. The \nbureaus also conduct random inspections on treatment processes. \n3.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n36.  TTC and TWE were advised of ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require TWE to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities. Such obligations shall be contained in the loan and equity \ninvestment documentation, which will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential \nviolation of these undertakings. \nD.  Unique Features \n37.  Integrated river basin management.  The proposed project is an integral part of the \nbasin-wide Songhua water resources management initiative, and the SRBPCMP. It will \ncomplement ongoing ADB sovereign operations to address pollution control in the SRB. The \nwater quality improvements will contribute to integrated water resource management and \npollution control, a basinwide management program, and transboundary pollution prevention \nand control. The proposed project reflects a continuation of ADB's effort to improve the \nenvironment of the SRB.

Public\u2014private partnership.  The proposed project is catalyzing additional public and \nprivate sector investments in reducing pollution in the SRB. ADB's East Asia Department and \nPSOD are adopting a PPP approach to address the significant wastewater treatment funding \nneeds for the SRB. The HPG is also strongly promoting PPP in the water supply and \nwastewater treatment sector to solve the funding shortage problem, and improve management \nand operational efficiency. The PPP models being applied in the project include privatization, \nbuild\u2014operate\u2014transfer, operation concession, etc. Further, the project will source equity funding \nfrom foreign strategic investors. Due to the competitiveness of private water companies in \nSingapore and the strong potential of their involvement, the Government of Singapore, \nrepresented by the Public Utilities Board and Singapore Cooperation Enterprise, has committed \nto provide support to the HPG with regards to water resource management and water projects \ndevelopment. ", "11 \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  The ADB Assistance \n1.  Equity Investment \n39.  The proposed equity investment will involve the acquisition of ordinary shares in TVVE for \nup to the lesser of 15% of the total paid-up equity capital of TVVE or $10 million, funded from \nADB's ordinary capital resources. \n2.  Loan \n40. The proposed ADB loan facility will comprise an A loan, to be funded by ADB, and a B \nloan, to be funded by commercial banks under an ADB participation agreement. \n41. The A loan is for up to 0NY250 million, provided from ADB's ordinary capital resources \nwithout government guarantee, and will be funded from the proceeds of yuan-denominated \nbonds issued by AD B.22  \n42. The B loan, for up to $100 million, will be participated in by international commercial \nbanks. \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n43.  ADB's assistance for the project is justified based on its development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It will support the government's development plan and ADB's operational \nstrategies. ADB's participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \nThe project aims to contribute towards meeting MDG target 10 on water and \nsanitation in the PRC. In the PRC, 268 million people need to be provided access \nto safe drinking water, and another 372 million need the provision of sanitation, in \norder to reach MDG target 10 by 2015. \n(ii) The project supports the government's 11th FYP, which has accorded priority to \nthe resolution of problems related to water pollution and scarcity of water \nresources. The project will contribute to the achievement of the government's \ntargets in urban sewage treatment and water supply capacity. The government \nwill continue to promote urbanization to develop and expand markets and to \ncreate jobs. This will in turn increase the demand for water-related infrastructure. \n(iii) The project will help improve critically needed water infrastructure in the SRB \nwhere there is a pronounced water resource shortage. Municipalities and \nindustries to be covered by the project will benefit from a package of benefits that \ninclude capital, high-grade technology transfer, and managerial expertise. \n(iv) The project is consistent with ADB's Water Policy (footnote 11) and the Water \nFinancing Program 2006-2010 (footnote 12). In response to the huge unmet \nwater needs of Asia and the Pacific, and consistent with the recommendations of \nvarious international initiatives to double water investments (footnote 13), ADB \nhas made water a core business area and envisages doubling its water \ninvestments to more than $2 billion annually (footnote 14). \n22 \nThe disbursement in yuan will be subject to ADB's funding availability. If ADB is unable to procure sufficient yuan to \nfund the A loan. TVVE can request ADB to disburse all or part of the A loan in dollars. ", "12 \n(v) The project is in line with ADas country strategy and program in the PRC which \nhas improving the environment as one of its five priority areas of focus. The \nproject reflects the infrastructure focus of ADIB's private sector operations in the \nPRC. In the infrastructure sector. ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with \nbankable contractual and financial structuring to encourage private sector \nparticipation and enhance management expertise. \n(vi) The project also aims to catalyze both public sector and private sector \ninvestments in pollution control management in the SRB. The PPP approach \ntaken by ADB's East Asia Department and PSOD has a strong demonstration \neffect for any future large infrastructure investment program requiring significant \ncapital. The approach should replicable in other sectors, provinces, or DMCs. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment and loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i) an equity investment of up to $10,000,000 in Tongfang (Harbin) Water \nEngineering Co., Ltd. from ADB's ordinary capital resources: and \n(ii) an A loan of up to CNY250,000,000 to Tongfang (Harbin) Water Engineering Co., \nLtd. from ADB's ordinary capital resources without government guarantee: and a \nB loan in an amount of up to $100,000,000 to be funded by international \ncommercial banks, \nfor the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project Private Sector \nFacility, and on such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n26 March 2010 "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20100910180147+08'00'", "Creator": "OmniPage CSDK 16", "ModDate": "D:20100913081648+08'00'", "Producer": "OmniPage CSDK 16"}, "author_page": "Vice-President  X.
