It will be driven by the demand\nand needs of LGUs that now lack urban infrastructure and municipal\nservices  needed  for  urban  development.  LGUs  that  meet  the\nselection criteria will be eligible for subproject financing from LBP.\nThe  Project  also  aims  to  improve  the  institutional  capacity  of\nparticipating LGUs to provide, operate, and maintain essential urban\ninfrastructure services.\nClassification Poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment Initial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken  for\nrepresentative core subprojects.\nRationale The  high  rate  of  urban  growth  in  the  Philippines  combined  with\ninadequate local investments has led to serious deficiencies in the\nprovision  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services,\nparticularly in Mindanao. Despite its abundant natural resources and\nfertile soil, Mindanao is among the poorest regions in the country.\nThe incidence of urban poverty is nearly twice the national urban\naverage, and the provision of municipal services is well below the\nnational average. The institutional capacity of LGUs in Mindanao to\nundertake their devolved functions and deliver adequate municipal\nservices varies widely. Because of prolonged civil strife and partly\nbecause of high urbanization coupled with low institutional capacity,\nLGUs  can  hardly  meet  the  demand  for  basic  urban  services.\nConsequently, there is an urgent need to improve urban service\ndelivery  by  (i)  upgrading  and  expanding  infrastructure,  and  (ii)\nimproving  the  capability  and  capacity  of  LGUs  to  provide  and\nmanage services. Improved basic urban services will help reduce\npoverty and raise living standards, strengthen links between urban\nand rural areas, and support the peace process.\nObjectives and Scope The Project aims to improve the quality of life of urban residents in\nMindanao by enabling their local governments to provide, upgrade,\nand  rehabilitate  basic  municipal  infrastructure  and  services.  The\nProject consists of two parts. Part A, physical infrastructure, covers\ninvestments in water supply, sanitation, drainage, flood control, solid\nwaste management, urban roads, bridges, public markets, and other\npublic  facilities  for  about  40  LGUs  in  Mindanao.  Under  part  B,\ninstitutional capacity building, LGUs will be trained and assisted in\npreparing  comprehensive  land  use  plans  and  implementing  the\nfinancial  resource  mobilization  program  so  as  to  improve  their\ncapacity  to  plan,  provide,  manage,  and  maintain  municipal\ninvestments  and  services.  The  Project  will  also  (i)  enhance  the\naccess of poor communities in the project area to affordable basic\ninfrastructure and services, and (ii) contribute to balanced regional", "iii\ndevelopment and improved urban environment.\nCost Estimates The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $60.0  million  equivalent,\ncomprising $27.6 million equivalent (46 percent) in foreign exchange\ncost and $32.4 million equivalent (54 percent) in local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan ($ million equivalent)\n    Foreign    Local\nSource    Exchange Currency       Total Percent\nAsian Development Bank     24.6                 5.4            30.0      50\nNordic Development Fund      3.0      3.0 6.0      10\nNational Government           -                   7.3 7.3      12\nLocal Government Units          -      7.3 7.3      12\nLand Bank of the Philippines   -      9.4 9.4      16\nTotal                                      27.6               32.4              60.0           100___\nLoan Amount and LBP will be the Borrower and the Republic of the Philippines will\nTerms guarantee the loan to LBP at 1 percent annual fee. The foreign\nexchange risk will be covered by the Republic of the Philippines at a\n4 percent annual fee to LBP on the withdrawn amount of the loan. A\nloan  of  \u00a53,676,050,000  (equivalent  to  $30.0  million)  from  ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have an 18-year term, including a\ngrace period of 4 years; an interest rate determined in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of\n0.75 percent per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0 percent; conversion\noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the\ndraft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion\nGuidelines, and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement.\nCofinancing LBP  will  provide  $9.4  million  equivalent  from  its  own  funds  to\ncofinance  the  infrastructure  investment  component.  The  Nordic\nDevelopment  Fund  (NDF)  will  provide  approximately  $6  million\n(special  drawing  rights  4.5  million)  equivalent  to  support  the\ninstitutional capacity-building component, and the Republic of the\nPhilippines will be the Borrower of NDF credit. NDF\u2019s concessional\nloan carries no interest, and has a 40-year maturity, including a 10-\nyear grace period.\nRelending LBP will relend the loan proceeds to LGUs for urban infrastructure\ninvestments, according to the agreed-upon criteria. The relending\nrate will be fixed for the term of the subloan and will be set at the\ntime of subloan drawdown to minimize interest rate risk. It will be\nbased  on  the  sum  of  the  prevailing  interest  rate  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), its foreign exchange risk premium, and its\nguarantee  fee,  plus  LBP\u2019s  spread.  The  participating  LGUs  will\ncontribute about 12 percent of the infrastructure investment costs\nfrom their own funds. In accordance with the prevailing relending\nterms for LGUs finance, the subloans to LGUs will have a maximum\nmaturity of 15 years, including a maximum grace period of 3 years.\nGrant funds from the national Government will be channeled through\nLBP as the government depository bank.", "iv\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2008\nImplementation LBP  will,  for  the  infrastructure  investment,  (i)  coordinate  project\nArrangements implementation  with  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local\nGovernment  (DILG),  (ii)  oversee  the  review  and  approval  of  the\nsubloans, (iii) prepare and maintain project and imprest accounts\nseparately for project-related accounting, and (iv) have them audited\nannually for the infrastructure investment component.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), to be guaranteed by the Republic of the\nPhilippines, for the Mindanao Basic Urban Services Sector Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1998, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA)1 to formulate a Project to improve the access of Mindanao\u2019s urban residents to\nmunicipal infrastructure and services. The TA, completed in May 1999, identified the scope for\ninfrastructure investments in Mindanao and the capacity-building needs of local government\nunits (LGUs).2 The TA also covered feasibility studies for pilot LGUs. The proposed Project was\nformulated on the basis of a sample of 13 LGUs. Subprojects were prepared for three LGUs and\ndetailed  feasibility  studies  were  made  for  five  representative  components.  The  Loan  Fact-\nFinding Mission was undertaken intermittently from June to December 1999, and LBP confirmed\nits  willingness  to  cofinance  the  proposed  Project.  Following  consultations  with  pilot  LGUs\nthrough  workshops,  and  the  Government\u2019s  endorsement,  an  Appraisal  Mission3  visited\nMindanao  in  September  2000  and  held  discussions  with  key  Government  officials  and\nrepresentatives of LBP, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and potential beneficiaries. The\nMission reached an understanding with Government and LBP on the project concept, scope,\ncost, financing, implementation arrangements, capacity-building components, and policy action\nagenda.  This  report  is  based  on  those  discussions  and  the  reports  prepared  by  the  TA\nconsultants. The project framework is shown in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1.  Urbanization and Demand for Infrastructure\n3. The Philippines has a population of about 75 million, of which 52 percent, or 39 million,\nis urban.4 Although the national population growth rate slowed from 3.0 percent to 2.3 percent\nper year between 1960 and 2000, the urban population grew at an average annual rate of more\nthan 5 percent over the same period. The urban population increased from 8 million in 1960 to\n39 million in 2000. By 2010, the Philippines is expected to have about 90 million people, 60\npercent (54 million) of them living in the urban areas.\n                                                \n1 TA 3021-PHI: Mindanao Urban Planning and Basic Services Project, for $1,000,000, approved on 27 May 1998.\n2 Government in the Philippines comprises four levels of administration: national, provincial (78), city (83) and\nmunicipality  (1,527),  and  barangay (equivalent  to  community:  41,960).  All  authorities  below  the  national\nGovernment are generally referred to as local government units (LGUs). The proposed Project uses the term LGUs\nto refer to city and municipal administration.\n3 The Mission comprised K. Choe, Urban Economist/Mission Leader; F. Yue, Programs Officer; K. Emzita,  Counsel;\nS. Akimura, Urban Development Specialist; S. Handayani, Social Development Specialist; H. Huang, Control\nOfficer; A. Palacio, Financial/Economic Analyst, Staff Consultant; J. Mendoza, Policy/Institutional Specialist, Staff\nConsultant; and C. Ledesma, Thomsons Ratings Banking/Financial Specialist, Staff Consultant.\n4 The definition of \u201curban\u201d provided by the National Economic and Development Authority  is based on a population\ndensity of more than 500 residents per square kilometer  and the existence of certain basic facilities, such as a\nchurch, a plaza, a market, and a public building in cities and municipalities.", "2\n4. The fast growth in the urban population has resulted in a substantial backlog in the\ndelivery of urban services. Despite gradual improvements, only about 60 percent of those living\nin urban areas have access to household water supply, and almost none have access to\nsewerage systems. Almost 40 percent of solid waste remains uncollected or is thrown into\nunsanitary open dump sites. Traffic congestion is common as there is only 1 kilometer (km) of\nurban roads for every 1,800 people. Every year, flooding occurs due to inadequate drainage\nand  flood  protection  facilities.  This  causes  damage  to  property  and  loss  of  human  lives.5\nInsufficient and unsanitary facilities in public markets, which are usually located at town centers,\ninhibit productive economic activities and threaten public health.\n5. The Philippines faces the difficult task of providing and maintaining an adequate level of\nbasic infrastructure and municipal services. Rapid urbanization continues to place enormous\npressure on government institutions, which must supply the urban services needed to sustain\neconomic growth and to improve the quality of life. The poor urban communities in particular are\ndisadvantaged by the high level of service deprivation and environmental degradation.\n2.  Urban Poverty\n6. About  eight  million  urban  people,  or  21.5  percent  of  the  urban  population6  in  the\nPhilippines,  live  below  the  poverty  line,  which  is  defined  as  a  minimum  yearly  income  of\nP12,577 per person.7 Most urban poor live in a blighted environment, with little or no access to\nbasic urban infrastructure and services, sanitation, capital assets or financial sources, and\nemployment  and  livelihood  opportunities.  If  unmeasured  deprivation  of  access  to  basic\ninfrastructure services as well as unaccounted-for informal settlers were taken into account, at\nleast one third of the urban population would be considered urban poor.8 Though the incidence\nof poverty in urban areas is lower than the national average (37.5 percent of population), the\nuneven concentration of poverty and poor living conditions in urban areas makes urban poverty\nrelatively harsher than rural poverty. Urban poverty statistics based on income data alone do not\ncapture the dire living conditions of the urban poor, and urban poverty has been recognized as a\nkey sector issue9 that must be urgently addressed.\n3. Sector Institutions\n7. The passage of the Local Government Code (LGC) in 1991 triggered decentralization of\nauthority and responsibilities for financing, managing, and developing urban areas from the\nnational Government to LGUs. The national Government retains responsibility for policy and\nstrategy formulation, legislative and regulatory control, advisory services, and capital investment\nin  national  infrastructure.  Because  urban  development  is  a  complex  process,  several\ndepartments and agencies are involved in the urban sector. At the central level, the Department\nof  the  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG)  is  mandated  to  guide  and  strengthen  the\nadministrative performance of LGUs. The Department of Finance (DOF) and the Department of\nBudget and Management (DBM) are responsible for fiscal management, resource allocation,\nand budget sharing between the national and local governments. The National Economic and\nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) makes national and regional plans, and the Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Coordinating Council (HUDCC) formulates urban sector policy. The Department of\nPublic Works and Highways (DPWH) carries out national physical infrastructure development\n                                                \n5 In 1997 alone, the damage caused by flooding was estimated to cost over P2 billion.\n6 According to the most recent poverty data available (ADB, 2000. Philippines: Country Assistance Plan).\n7 The current threshold is equivalent to only three fourths of the international standard measure, \u201cdollar per day.\u201d\n8 ADB, 1999. Urban Sector Profile: Philippines.\n9 National Anti-Poverty Commission, Philippines. National Anti-Poverty Action Agenda 2000.", "3\nand the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) enforces environmental\nregulations,  issues  environmental  compliance  certificates  for  projects,  and  monitors  urban\nenvironmental development. Each agency has a specific role in urban development, but their\nvarious responsibilities are not well coordinated. To improve the efficiency of urban sector\nmanagement, coordination by the national Government needs to be strengthened to set the\nplanning framework and ensure consistent management guidelines. The institutional framework\nthat clearly defines the roles of the government departments and the relevant agencies must be\ndeveloped.\n8. At  the  regional  level,  the  regional  development  councils  facilitate  intragovernment\ntransactions,  and  coordinate  and  prioritize  development  and  investment  proposals.  DILG\nregional and field offices (province, city, and municipal) are the extension arms of the DILG for\nsupervising and monitoring local government functions and implementation of national programs\nby LGUs. DILG has strong vertical links to maintain dialogue with LGUs at all levels. DILG has\nnot yet operationalized any means to assess the operations, performance, and governance of\nLGUs and to promote their managerial and technical productivity.\n9. At city and municipal levels, LGUs are classified into six income classes according to\ntheir revenue, land area, and population, with class I LGUs having the highest income and class\nVI the lowest. The first class cities and municipalities should have had an average annual\nincome of, at least, P120 million and P20 million (in 1991 constant price), respectively, while the\nsixth class cities and municipalities may have had an average annual income less than P20\nmillion  and  P4  million  (in  1991  constant  price),  respectively.  Under  the  LGC,  all  LGUs,\nregardless of income, are expected to provide the local infrastructure and municipal services\nneeded by residents. LGUs need to be self-reliant to finance essential urban infrastructure and\nservices, such as water supply,10 sanitation, drainage, flood control, solid waste management,\nmunicipal roads, bridges, public markets, transport terminals, and other municipal enterprise\nfacilities.\n4. LGU Finances\n10. About two thirds of LGU revenues come from the internal revenue allotment (IRA)\nprovided by the national Government, and the remaining third from local taxes and other local\nrevenues. With their substantial reliance on the national budget and expanded taxing powers\nunder the LGC, LGUs are expected to set aside 20 percent of their IRA for local development\nfunds.\n11. Apart from the IRA, LGUs may avail themselves of debt financing for investment capital\nfrom the Municipal Development Fund (MDF), government financial institutions (GFIs) such as\nLBP and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), or private banks (primarily the Philippine\nNational Bank, which was a GFI until its recent privatization). The development funds from IRA\ncan be a significant source of cash flows that can be tapped into for the long-term capital\nrequired for infrastructure development. However, many lower class LGUs have underutilized\nborrowing  capacity  and  are  constrained  in  delivering  basic  services  because  of  lack  of\ninvestment capital. In general, private banks are reluctant to lend to LGUs mainly because (i)\nthe banks have no access to information on the financial status of LGUs, (ii) LGUs do not have\ndeposits at hand to serve as collateral, and (iii) the banks do not specialize in term lending for\ncapital investment. GFIs, which are the authorized depository banks for LGUs, therefore have\n                                                \n10  About 1,000 water supply utilities managed by LGUs in smaller urban and rural areas deliver the service to over\n31 million people, while 500 water districts under the Local Water Utilities Administration serve 33 percent of the\ntotal urban population.", "4\nan edge over private banks when it comes to lending to LGUs. Though the GFIs can use the\nLGUs\u2019 deposits or scheduled deposits (such as IRA funds) as collateral, their resources are\nlimited to short-term lending. LGUs also do not have direct access to official development\nassistance loans since these loans usually require guarantees from the national Government.\nFor their financing needs, lower-income LGUs rely mostly on the MDF,11 which has a rigid\napplication and approval process. Underresourced LGUs must be given more access to and\ninformation about financial intermediaries for their long-term capital needs.\n12. While LGUs have taxation authority under the LGC, lack of experience among their staff,\nlack of political will, and inefficiencies in fiscal management have generally kept them from\nexercising such authority effectively. Lower-income LGUs tend to rely more on the IRA portion\n(up to 90 percent of annual revenues) than higher-income LGUs do (35 percent for highly\nurbanized  cities),  and  thus  have  low  capital  reserves.  LGUs  are  more  likely  to  generate\nrevenues from municipal enterprises rather than from improvements in the tax base through\nstrategic  financial  planning  and  fiscal  management.  Lower-income  LGUs  (those  between\nclasses III and VI) have relatively weak financial management capability and cannot meet the\ngrowing demand for better services. The imbalance calls for an improved tax basis and active\nlending by creditors. Comprehensive capability and capacity building is needed to promote\nbalanced growth and to help underresourced LGUs improve their capacity to function properly\nand thus achieve efficient decentralization.\n5. Mindanao\n13. Mindanao is composed of five administrative regions (IX, X, XI, XII, CARAGA), and the\nAutonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), with a total of 24 provinces, 19 cities, and\nabout 408 urban and rural municipalities. Of the 17 million people living in Mindanao, about 6\nmillion (35 percent) are classified as urban dwellers. Mindanao is lagging behind the rest of the\ncountry economically: over one third of its labor force is unemployed or underemployed, and per\ncapita income is only 75 percent of the national average. The Mindanao urban sector accounts\nfor only about 50 percent of gross regional product for the region, lower than the proportion of\nthe urban sector as a whole in the national economy (about 80 percent).\n14. Deficiencies in urban infrastructure and service levels in Mindanao are higher than the\nnational average. For example, the incidence of the use of drinking water from potentially\npolluted sources is 24 percent in urban Mindanao, compared with 12 percent in the Philippines\nas a whole. Similarly, whereas almost 80 percent of households in the urban Philippines have\naccess to water-sealed toilets, only 60 percent of households in Mindanao enjoy such facilities.\nThe inadequacies in basic infrastructure services in Mindanao are due partly to the difficulty of\naccess to capital markets and partly to the weak technical, institutional, and financial capacity of\nthe LGUs in the region. The National Anti-Poverty Commission, in its National Anti-Poverty\nAgenda 2000, states that measures for strengthening institutional capacity are fundamental to\naddressing poverty reduction.\n15. Poverty  is  also  an  endemic  problem  in  Mindanao.  In  1997,  among  the  regions,\nMindanao had the highest incidence of poverty in its urban areas (37 percent). The incidence of\npoverty was highest (51 percent) in the urban areas of ARMM and lowest in the urban areas of\nregions IX (26 percent) and XI (27 percent), respectively, but the two latter regions had a higher\n                                                \n11  The Municipal Development Fund (MDF) was established in 1984, under DOF. It is a conduit for foreign\nassistance, in the form of revolving funds, to LGUs. The funds are generally available to lower class LGUs\n(classes III, IV, V, and VI).", "5\nproportion  of  the  extreme  poor.12  Given  the  urban  poverty  threshold  of  about  P11,500  in\nMindanao, a survey carried out in representative core pilot LGUs13 at the end of 1998 revealed\nan average of nearly 50 percent poverty in the urban areas. Many urban dwellers, particularly\nthe poor, have limited access to basic infrastructure and essential municipal services that cities\nare expected to offer.\n16. The Government aims to promote balanced economic growth with equity throughout the\ncountry, in part by developing strategic urban areas as regional socioeconomic centers. For the\ndevelopment of Mindanao, the Government has recognized the importance of peace and order.\nFollowing the signing of the Formal Peace Agreement in September 1996, Executive Order 371\ncreated the Special Zone for Peace and Development (SZOPAD)14 to (i) provide basic services\nin depressed areas, (ii) promote investment opportunities, and (iii) provide capability-building\nassistance  to  local  community  organizations.  The  recent  resurgence  of  armed  conflict  in\nMindanao has again made peace and order the focal concern for long-term sustainable social\nand economic development in the region. At the same time, the Government recognizes that, in\naddition to the political dimension, economic development is fundamental to lasting peace.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n17. The Government policy framework for the urban sector is contained in the National\nUrban  Development  and  Housing  Framework  (NUDHF),  1999\u20132004.15  The  NUDHF  covers\nmajor policy recommendations on (i) urban development as a means of economic growth, (ii)\nurban  land  management  as  integrated  development  planning,  (iii)  urban  environmental\nmanagement to improve the quality of life, (iv) physical infrastructure as strategic interventions\nto improve productivity and provide employment  opportunities, (v) affordable shelter for the\nurban poor, and (vi) improvements in LGU governance capacity. Approved in May 2000, the\nNUDHF  is  a  major  step  to  the  sound  development  of  the  urban  sector,  linking  urban\ndevelopment with economic growth, spatial integration, institution building, and a better quality\nof life for urban residents.\n18. The Philippine National Development Plan: Directions for the 21st Century sets long-\nterm (up to the year 2025) development goals. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan\n(MTPDP), 1999\u20132004, establishes shorter-term (up to 2004) objectives for the country based on\nthose goals. The overarching development objective is economic growth with social equity. The\nconcept encompasses both industrial development and agricultural growth, at the same time\nemphasizing poverty reduction as a critical element of the development strategy. At the national\nlevel, these policy and strategic initiatives imply the key policy directions of reducing regional\ndisparities and closing the poverty gap between Mindanao and the rest of the country.\n19. The overall policy framework for the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is in the\nSocial Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act, passed in 1997. The Government has adopted an\narea-based,  sectoral,  and  focused  intervention  approach  to  poverty  reduction,  which  is\nincorporated in the MTPDP. The MTPDP sets forth the national development policy for the next\nfive years to reduce social and economic inequality and at the same time ensure steady growth\nof income. The Project supports the Government\u2019s objectives and approaches to area-based\nsectoral poverty reduction.\n                                                \n12  The extreme poor are those with an annual income of less than P8,000.

To achieve both development and sustainable peace and order, the Government has\nalso recognized the need to create a more effective coordinating mechanism to synchronize and\nintegrate the implementation of all development plans, projects, and programs for Mindanao.\nExecutive Order 261 on 5 July 2000 established a Mindanao Coordinating Council to guide and\ncoordinate both immediate rehabilitation and long-term development efforts. Mindanao has,\nmoreover,  been  given  an  increasingly  high  priority  in  economic  planning  and  Government\nbudget allocation.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n21. Several external assistance agencies are involved in the urban sector. ADB has been\ninvolved in the Philippine water supply sector for over two decades, and began assisting the\nbroader  urban  sector  in  1995.  ADB  has  adopted  a  comprehensive  urban  development\napproach, providing assistance to improve basic urban infrastructure and build institutional\ncapacity among the participating LGUs. The Regional Municipal Development Project16 focused\non the development of rapidly growing provincial cities, including General Santos and Iligan in\nMindanao.  The  Subic  Bay  Area  Municipal  Development17  and  Clark  Area  Municipal\nDevelopment18 projects included infrastructure improvements in LGUs in the special economic\nzones,  together  with  comprehensive  institutional  development  support  for  the  participating\nLGUs.  The  recently  approved  Pasig  River  Environmental  Management  and  Rehabilitation\nSector  Development  Program19  also  has  a  strong  focus  on  urban  poverty  reduction  and\nenvironmental improvement.\n22. In addition to providing TA for integrated urban development projects, ADB continues to\nuse TAs to build institutional capacity. To strengthen the institutional, legislative, and regulatory\nframework of the Philippine urban sector, it has provided three advisory TAs20 to relevant urban\nsector agencies. ADB has also paid particular attention to strengthening the overall financing\ncapability of LGUs. Among the TAs provided for this purpose are a TA to strengthen the in-\nhouse capabilities of LBP to finance LGU infrastructure projects,21 a TA loan to LBP for a\nrevolving credit facility for private sector participation in local infrastructure development,22 and a\nTA  to  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  to  develop  the  financial  capacity  and\nresource mobilization of LGUs. 23\n23. Over the last three decades, the World Bank has assisted the Philippine urban sector\nthrough a series of comprehensive urban infrastructure development programs, including the\nRegional  Cities  Development  Project,  the  Municipal  Development  Project,  and  the  Local\nGovernment Finance and Development Project. These projects aim to promote decentralization\nand to strengthen Government financing mechanisms for local investment projects.

Other external assistance to the Philippine urban sector in recent years has focused\nlargely on strengthening the technical and administrative management capabilities of LGUs in\nthe context of decentralization. The United Nations Development Programme has provided\nsome  support  to  strengthen  local  environmental  planning  and  management  capacities  of\nselected cities under its Sustainable Cities Program. By far the largest bilateral contributor in the\nurban sector has been Japan, primarily through the Japan Bank for International Cooperation\n(JBIC) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). JICA has supported a program\nproviding  road  construction  equipment  assistance  in  Mindanao.  Other  bilateral  agencies,\nincluding the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the United States\nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  the  European  Union,  and  the  Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency,  have  provided  assistance  in  decentralization,  capacity\nbuilding, and the rehabilitation programs of SZOPAD. USAID has been actively supporting a\nnumber of local development programs in Mindanao such as the Growth with Equity Program\nand the Governance and Local Democracy Program.\n25. In the course of project processing, ADB maintained close coordination with various\ninternational aid agencies active in the urban sector, such as JICA, JBIC, the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs  of  Finland,  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF),  the  Nordic  Investment  Bank,  the\nSwedish International Development Agency, the AusAID, and the Islamic Development Bank.\nThe coordination enabled ADB to exchange information with these agencies on sector-related\nactivities and to seek cofinancing possibilities. As a result, NDF24 has expressed interest in\nparticipating in the social infrastructure sector, and has agreed to cofinance the institutional\ncapacity building program of the proposed Project.\nD. Lessons Learned\n26. Based on the results of the midterm review of the Regional Municipal Development\nProject and the experience of other international agencies, the following lessons have been\nlearned: (i) the commitment of local institutions and communities is essential; (ii) advance action\nis needed for recruiting consultants and establishing project implementation arrangements and\noffices to avoid start-up delays; (iii) financial incentives, such as matching grants, should be\nconsidered for underresourced LGUs to encourage them to engage in environmental projects;\n(iv) funds must be channeled efficiently to LGUs to elicit their participation; and (v) LGUs should\nbe given comprehensive assistance in capacity building to sustain development impact.\n27. The most important considerations in project design are ensuring strong commitment\nfrom the participating LGUs to avoid delays, and building local government capacity to operate\nand maintain facilities and promote the policy agenda. The proposed Project adopts a demand-\ndriven approach, which will require early commitment from the LGUs, and thus make the project\nless susceptible to changes in political leadership and development priorities. LGUs and end\nusers will be fully involved from the start to build a sense of ownership of the demand-driven\nsubprojects. LGUs\u2019 participation will require acceptance of the recommendations resulting from\ninstitutional capacity-building programs built into the proposed Project. The sector approach to\nthe proposed Project will likewise allow greater flexibility during implementation.\n                                                \n24  NDF has provided consulting services and equipment for economic social infrastructure development during the\nlast decade in Bangladesh, Kyrgyz, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, and\nSir Lanka together with ADB. Loan 1750-PHI: Education and Skills Development, for $25.0 million, approved on\n24 August 2000, is the first project in the Philippines cofinanced by NDF ($8.0 million equivalent) with ADB.", "8\n28. ADB\u2019s experience in the Philippines urban sector has shown that the projects should\ninclude  a  component  of  grant  financing  from  the  national  Government  for  nonrevenue-\ngenerating subprojects, particularly those of low-income LGUs, to balance development across\nLGUs. Furthermore, channeling the loan proceeds requires efficient and effective operations.\nThe use of governmental financial intermediaries, such as LBP or DBP, will improve operations\nof sublending to LGUs because of their better field presence.\nE. ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy\n29. ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the Philippines25 conforms closely to the Government\u2019s\ndevelopment priorities. The strategy places increased importance on poverty reduction and\nsocial development by (i) promoting equitable growth, (ii) improving basic social services, and\n(iii) improving management and protection of the environment. In the urban sector, ADB\u2019s\ndevelopment strategy calls for (i) encouraging integrated urban development initiatives; (ii)\nassisting the Government in strengthening its institutional structure; (iii) supporting LGUs in\nfinancial,  institutional,  and  administrative  capacity  building;  (iv)  rationalizing  the  financing\nmechanism  for  urban  development  under  the  decentralized  government  system;  and  (v)\ndeveloping public-private partnerships in delivering and managing essential urban infrastructure\nservices.\n30. The urban sector strategy also calls for incremental and systematic expansion of ADB\u2019s\ninvolvement in the sector. The increasing complexity of the sector and the large number of its\ninstitutions require in-depth analysis and focus on policy and institutional issues, which in turn\nrequire emphasis on capacity building. Projects must be carefully prepared and their institutional\naspects  emphasized  to  maximize  project  benefits  and  increase  sustainability.  Project\ninterventions to address equity issues are also needed. The project intervention in Mindanao,\nwhich involves both infrastructure investments and capacity building for LGUs in the region, is\nconsistent with ADB\u2019s strategy.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n31. ADB has had continuing dialogue with the Philippine Government since the start of its\nassistance  to  the  urban  development  sector.  The  policy  dialogue  in  conjunction  with  the\nproposed Project has covered a wide range of issues in the sector, ranging from overall sector\ndevelopment to specific capacity building needs in the project area. This includes the need to (i)\nformulate an integrated investment plan consistent with urban development sector framework\nand  policy,  (ii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  management\nfunctions, (iii) develop guiding principles for cost sharing in LGU infrastructure development, (iv)\nexpand access to GFIs, and (v) support decentralization based on better fiscal and resource\nmanagement by LGUs. The major directions of the policy dialogue are outlined below. The\ncurrent situation and agreed-upon policy actions are presented in a time-bound action plan\n(Appendix 2).\n1. Sector Development Policy\n32. With ADB support, the Government has prepared the NUHDF for 1999-2004, using a\nconsultative  participatory  approach,26  to  provide  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for\ndevelopment  and  to  guide  interventions  in  the  sector.  Through  ADB-supported  public\n                                                \n25  ADB. 1998. Country Operational Strategy, Philippines.\n26  Numerous consultation workshops involving core technical working groups of national Government agencies were\nundertaken. Nationwide consultation seminars were also carried out to get the views of local governments, civic\norganizations, nongovernment agencies, and the private sector.", "9\nconsultations, the Government recognizes that improvement can occur only gradually, over the\nlong term and through the coordinated effort of various agencies in the development process.\nMoreover,  it  realizes  that,  despite  decentralization,  the  national  Government  must  provide\noverall guidance to local governments as they put its principles into action. The Government\nplans to draw up an action plan, including an integrated investment program,27 to operationalize\nand implement the NUDHF.\n2. Sector Management\n33. ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in  assessing  alternative  ways  of  improving  the\ninstitutional structure for urban sector development.28 To promote efficient and sound sector\ndevelopment, (i) the legal framework for the key agencies in the urban sector was reviewed, and\n(ii)  recommendations  for  improving  interdepartmental  coordination  were  prepared.  The\nGovernment has agreed to review the functions and responsibilities of agencies involved in\nurban sector development, and to define clear and appropriate institutional functions.\n34. The policy dialogue with the Government has also dealt with urban sector management.\nThe LGC provides the legal framework for the roles and responsibilities of LGUs in overall\ndevelopment, and DILG supervises LGU administration. However, beyond the administrative\nstructure  itself,  very  few  measures  deal  specifically  with  the  supervision,  monitoring,\nassessment, and improvement of LGUs\u2019 administrative performance. The Local Productivity and\nPerformance  Measurement  Program  initiated  by  DILG  in  1999  focused  mainly  on  limited\nmonitoring indicators of administrative functions. The Government expects to strengthen the\nperformance measurement scheme, including governance, and to test the scheme through the\nproposed Project area, before applying it nationwide.\n3. LGU Finance in the Urban Sector\n35. The LGU financing policies29 of the Government are intended to encourage LGUs to rely\nless on transfers from the national Government and more on locally generated resources, and\nto increase LGU access to private funds. Only very limited and selected national Government\ngrants  are  made  primarily  to  the  weaker  LGUs  for  environmental  nonrevenue-generating\nprojects. A TA (footnote 23) has been provided to strengthen public finance and the cost-\nsharing framework for LGUs supporting the Government\u2019s policy to rationalize cost-sharing\nschemes for urban infrastructure development between the national Government and LGUs.\nThe general principles for financial cost sharing between them remain an important policy issue\nfor further study and consensus within the Government. Under the Project, policy dialogue with\nthe Government in this area dwelt particularly on reforms needed to accelerate development in\nMindanao. Accordingly, a grant financing scheme to finance weaker LGUs\u2019 revenue- as well as\nnonrevenue-generating components was agreed upon with the Government under the proposed\nProject.\n4. Involving GFIs in LGU Financing\n36. The major sources of capital finance for LGUs are the MDF Office and the two GFIs:\nDBP  and  LBP.  While  MDF  operations  are  being  restructured  to  streamline  operational\n                                                \n27 The Urban Development and Housing Investment Plan will be prepared with external assistance.\n28 TA 3475-PHI: Institutional Strengthening of Housing and Urban Development Sector, for $150,000, approved on 2\nAugust 2000.\n29  Department of Finance. 1996. LGU Financing of Basic Services and Infrastructure Projects: A New Vision and\nPolicy Framework.", "10\nefficiency,30 the development mission of LBP should be supported by a sound financial position\nand access to long-term capital financing. LBP, with its widespread branch network throughout\nthe country, particularly in the project area, has led in providing financial assistance to LGUs. To\nensure effective project implementation, the Government agreed to channel its counterpart fund\nusing the same conduit, LBP, instead of the MDF Office. Also, to ensure LBP's long-term\ninvolvement and continued financial support for LGUs, LBP\u2019s staff will be trained to process,\nevaluate,  and  administer  development  projects  through  an  institutional  capacity-building\nprogram.\n5. Building the Capacity of LGUs\n37. Institutional strengthening and capability building, especially at the local government\nlevel, is an important long-term objective, particularly in the context of decentralization. ADB has\nbeen an active partner of the Government to address the need to improve local governance and\nefficient delivery of Government services at the local level. LGU capacity-building measures\ninclude the developing and upgrading strategic and managerial capacities, particularly for the\nenhancement  of  local  tax  revenue  in  connection  with  land  resource  and  tax  property\nmanagement.  To  promote  effective  land  resource  management,  the  Government  urges  all\nLGUs to prepare and submit comprehensive land use planning. ADB assistance under the\nProject  will  help  strengthen  LGUs  capacity  for  strategic  financial  planning  by  connecting\nproperty taxation with comprehensive land use planning.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n1.  Project Rationale\n38. Urban growth in the Philippines has outpaced the provision of basic urban infrastructure\nand  services,  adversely  affecting  the  quality  of  life  and  the  environment.  LGUs,  with\nresponsibility for urban development are hard pressed to meet the rapid increase in the demand\nfor municipal services. The urban poor, in particular, do not have adequate access to basic\nservices and facilities. A comprehensive and sustainable solution to the problem of inadequate\nbasic urban infrastructure is, therefore, urgently needed.\n39. Mindanao, the Philippines\u2019 second largest island, is often referred to as the food basket\nof the country because of its rich natural resources. But peace and order problems have slowed\nits development. Compared with the rest of the country, urban poverty is more widespread,\nincome  per  capita  is  lower,  and  the  urban  areas  offer  even  less  coverage  of  municipal\ninfrastructure and basic services. Existing disparities within Mindanao also hamper equitable\ngrowth. The 1996 Peace Agreement and the associated creation of SZOPAD were intended to\nspeed up development in areas racked by civil strife. Only limited success has been achieved,\nhowever, partly because of low access to the capital markets and lack of opportunities for local\ngovernments to initiate and implement development programs. The proposed Project supports\nthe Government\u2019s peace and development framework, and its efforts to rehabilitate urban areas\nin Mindanao and to promote equitable development in the country.\n                                                \n30 An executive order was issued by the President of the Philippines (E.O. No. 41) to convert MDF into a Municipal\nDevelopment Fund Office under the Office of Secretary of DOF.", "11\n40. The urban economy of the Philippines contributes a major share of the gross national\nproduct.31 Improvements in urban infrastructure in Mindanao will not only improve the efficiency\nof  urban  economic  activities  but  also  benefit  surrounding  peri-urban  areas.  The  proposed\nProject contributes to overall economic growth by providing basic urban infrastructure with a\nfocus of balanced regional development and by strengthening the capacity of participating LGUs\nto plan, provide, manage, and maintain municipal services. About 2 million people in urban\nMindanao, including at least 0.8 million below the poverty line, would benefit from the targeted\nsectoral intervention. The proposed approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy,\nwhich  pursues  the  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction  by  addressing  deficiencies  in\ninfrastructure,  supporting  decentralization,  and  adopting  a  holistic  approach  to  urban\ndevelopment.\n2. Project Area\n41. The project area will cover LGUs with a minimum urban population of 20,000 in the year\n2000 or expected to exceed 20,000 by 2002. Of the 427 city and municipal LGUs in Mindanao,\nabout 108 would meet this criterion. The 108 LGUs\u201467 in SZOPAD including 12 in ARMM, and\n41 in non-SZOPAD area \u2014 have some five million people, or more than 80 percent of the urban\npopulation of Mindanao. There are 19 cities and 89 municipalities, 55 percent of them in income\nclasses III to VI in the LGU sample. From the preliminary assessment of demand for urban\ninfrastructure, about 40 LGUs are expected to participate. Those that signified their interest and\npotential demand for investment are listed in Appendix 3.\n3. Sector Approach\n42. A sector lending approach will be used for the Project, which entails a large number of\ninvestments of varying sizes (mostly $0.2 million-$6 million) spread throughout Mindanao. This\nwill  provide  the  needed  flexibility  to  make  adjustments  in  the  investment  programs  as\nimplementation proceeds. The sector lending mode is considered appropriate in view of the\nfollowing considerations:\n(i)  The  overall  sector  policies  and  strategies  of  the  Government  for  urban\ninfrastructure development are sound, and a development planning framework\nfor Mindanao has been formulated.\n(ii)  A sound investment plan exists. The Project will finance a time slice (2002-2007)\nand an area slice (Mindanao urban LGUs) of the plan. Appendix 4 outlines the\nphysical investment plan for the urban sector of Mindanao.\n(iii)  The Executing Agencies (EAs), DILG and LBP, have the necessary experience\nto implement the Project. DILG has been implementing three projects with ADB\nsupport, and LBP has been implementing five. Part B of the Project will assist\nLGUs in implementing the infrastructure investments.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n43. The long-term development goal of the Project is to improve the quality of life of urban\nresidents in Mindanao by providing, upgrading, and rehabilitating basic municipal infrastructure\nand services. The immediate objectives are to (i) provide, upgrade, and rehabilitate basic\n                                                \n31 About half of the population in the Philippines is rural: it contributed about 20 percent of gross domestic product in\n1998, while the urban half accounted for almost 80 percent.", "12\nmunicipal infrastructure and services to increase the productivity of the urban and peri-urban\neconomy; (ii) improve the access of urban poor communities to basic municipal services; and\n(iii)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  and  capability  of  LGUs  to  provide,  manage,  and\nmaintain adequate municipal services and basic urban infrastructure.\n44. The proposed Project addresses the need for more equitable growth by balancing LGUs\u2019\ncommitments  through  a  demand-driven  approach  and  providing  financing  opportunities  for\nlower-income LGUs. The proposed approach reflects previous experiences in the sector, and\nwill help to minimize development gaps between stronger (high-income, or classes I and II) and\nweaker (low-income, or classes III to VI) LGUs. The Project will help strengthen LGUs within\nand outside the SZOPAD area, and enable them to initiate and execute development projects.\n45. The Project has two parts: A, infrastructure investment; and B, institutional capacity-\nbuilding  program  (ICBP).  Part  A  will  finance  subprojects  initiated  by  about  40  LGUs\n(subborrowers) in Mindanao. The subprojects will comprise urban infrastructure and services\ncomponents. Initial contacts and consultation with potentially interested LGUs indicate that\nabout one third of the components will be nonrevenue-generating (roads, bridges, sanitation,\ndrainage, flood protection, solid waste management, etc.) while two thirds will be revenue-\ngenerating (water supply facilities, public markets, bus terminals, and other public enterprises).\nThe components eligible for financing under part A are the following:\n (i) Local roads and bridges: rehabilitating and constructing of local roads, sidewalks,\nand bridges; providing maintenance equipment; and improving streetlights.\n(ii) Sanitation,  drainage,  and  flood  control:  providing  for  sludge  collection  and\ntransportation equipment, constructing low-cost sludge treatment facilities, and\nconstructing low-cost wastewater treatment facilities; upgrading drains or river\nembankments to increase capacity; and constructing new facilities necessary to\nease flooding.\n(iii) Solid waste management: providing equipment, vehicles, and facilities for solid\nwaste  management;  upgrading  facilities  and  disposal  sites;  and  constructing\ndisposal and recycling facilities.\n(iv) Water supply: rehabilitating and upgrading source works, treatment facilities, and\ntransmission  systems;  rehabilitating  or  upgrading  distribution  systems  and\nreducing  unaccounted-for  water;  and  constructing  source  works,  deep  wells,\npumping facilities, low-cost treatment facilities, and transmission and distribution\nsystems, including level III house connections, managed by LGUs.\n(v) Public market and bus terminals: constructing public market facilities and bus\nterminals, or improving sanitary and safety conditions of markets infrastructure\nfacilities;  improving  access  roads  or  footpaths  to  markets;  improving  lighting\nconditions and market kiosks.\n (vi) Other public facilities: rehabilitating or constructing public facilities, and upgrading\nor creating local municipal enterprises mandated by LGC to improve economic\nproductivity and quality of life for the LGU residents. These facilities include\nenvironmental management services or facilities related to general hygiene and\nsanitation (slaughterhouses), municipal buildings, public parks, parking spaces,\nand other structures.", "13\n46. Part B - ICBP, has four components: (i) project management support, (ii) subproject\npreparation  and  implementation  support,  (iii)  LGUs\u2018  capacity-building  program,  and  (iv)\ninstitutional strengthening of DILG in Mindanao. The ICBP will be implemented by DILG through\nthe Project Development Office (PDO) with the assistance of consultants. The components are\ndescribed below. Outline terms of reference for the proposed ICBP are in Appendix 5.\n(i) Project management support: assistance in project management and subproject\nimplementation, including start-up activities, detailed implementation schedules,\nbudgets, report formats, establishment of project implementation units (PIUs),\nprocurement  packages,  progress  reports,  completion  reports,  overall  project\nperformance monitoring system (PPMS), and resolution of issues.\n(ii) Subproject preparation and implementation support: assistance to participating\nLGUs, including subproject preparation, feasibility studies, preparing subproject\nappraisal reports (SPARs), bid documents, and procurement. The support will\ntake the form of on-the-job training for PIU staff in the LGUs concerned by a local\nexpert  pool  of  organizations  or  consultant  teams.  LBP  lending  centers  in\nMindanao will conduct joint appraisal as part of on-the-job training. PIUs will also\nbe assisted in preparing project completion reports for each subproject, covering\nits physical and institutional aspects.\n(iii)  LGU capacity-building program: assistance to LGUs in land use planning and\nfinancial management. Fund mobilization, budgeting, and cash management of\nthe LGUs will be reviewed, and strategic actions will be recommended to improve\nbudget  preparation,  resource  mobilization,  collection  efficiency,  and  financial\nrecords  management.  Financial  strategic  planning  will  be  linked  to\ncomprehensive  land  use  planning  to  enhance  local  revenues  from  property\ntaxation. While preparing land use plans, local government officials will receive\non-the-job  training  in  how  to  reflect  strategic  development  planning,  capital\ninvestment programming, and financial resource mobilization in a timely and\norderly manner. Knowledge transfer will be emphasized to sustain coherent and\neffective development planning skills.\n(iv) DILG institutional strengthening program: assistance to DILG in developing a\nself-assessment  tool  for  measuring  LGUs\u2019  administration  capacities,  and\nmunicipal infrastructure and service delivery performance. Local authorities will\nbe provided with a practical assessment tool for evaluating their service delivery,\nincluding level of citizens participation in governance, adequacy of municipal\nservice  delivery,  budget  allocation,  personnel  administration,  and  revenue\ngeneration. Participating LGUs will apply the tools, identify service improvement\nareas, and determine the extent of improvements achieved. The assessment tool\nwill be tested and refined during project implementation. The regional office of\nDILG and its attached training agencies such as the Local Government Academy\nwill be trained to administer, apply, and disseminate this assessment tool among\nurban LGUs in Mindanao, aiming for nationwide application for long-term sector\ndevelopment.\nC. Cost Estimates\n47. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $60.0 million equivalent, including physical\nand price contingencies, interest and other charges during construction, fees, taxes, and duties.\nOf the total cost, about $27.6 million equivalent (46 percent) is in foreign exchange and $32.4\nmillion equivalent (54 percent) is in local currency. The foreign exchange costs include $1.3", "14\nmillion interest and other charges during construction and front-end fees. Cost estimates are\nsummarized in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6.\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)a\n   Foreign    Local     Total\nItem Exchangeb Currency     Cost\nA.

The total project cost was derived from the cost estimates of representative basic urban\nservices for the 13 indicative LGUs.32 Further detailed cost estimates were computed for sample\ncomponents in three core pilot LGUs from among the 13. The core pilot LGUs were selected\nfrom different classes of cities and municipalities across the provinces of Mindanao, to assess\ntheir  borrowing  capacities  and  infrastructure  investment  needs.  The  proposed  Project  will\ninvolve about 40 LGUs at an average investment of $1.3 million for two components per\nsubproject LGU.33 Investment demand by subsector was estimated based on the percentage\ndistribution of subsector costs from the 13 indicative LGUs. It is expected that about 23 percent\nof infrastructure investment demand will be in the subsector local roads and bridges; 6 percent\nin sanitation drainage and flood control; 14 percent in solid waste management; 12 percent in\nwater supply; 27 percent in public market and bus terminals; while about 18 percent of the\ninfrastructure investment would be in other public facilities.\n                                                \n32  They are Parang (ARMM), Dipolog (Region IX), Kidapawan (Region XII), Tangub (Region X), Panabo (Region XI),\nSurigao (Region CARAGA), Zamboanga (Region IX), Valencia (Region X), Samal (Region XI), Koronadal (Region\nXI), Tubod (Region XII), Cotabato (Region XII), and Linga (Region CARAGA). The first three are the core pilot\nLGUs.\n33  An eligible LGU, as a subborrower, will prepare a subproject. LBP will execute a subloan agreement for a\nsubproject with the LGU. The subloan agreement for a subproject may contain more than one component.", "15\nD. Financing Plan\n49. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2, and details are in Appendix\n6. The ADB loan will finance 50 percent34 of the total Project cost. LBP will receive a loan of\n$30.0 million equivalent, including $1.3 million in interest and other charges during construction\nand 1 percent front-end fee, for infrastructure investment finance. The proposed ADB loan will\nfinance $24.6 million (82 percent) of the foreign exchange cost and $5.4 million (18 percent)\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  NDF  has  agreed  to  provide  the  Government  of  the\nPhilippines  parallel  cofinancing  of  $6.0  million  equivalent,  including  $3.0  million  in  foreign\nexchange costs. The Republic of the Philippines is the Borrower of NDF credit, and DILG is the\nEA for the part financed by NDF.35 LBP will provide $9.4 million equivalent from its own funds36.\nThe  participating  LGUs  will  provide  from  their  own  funds  the  equivalent  of  $7.3  million,\nrepresenting 12 percent of the total project cost, or 14 percent of the infrastructure investment.\nThe national Government through DILG will finance the remaining balance of $7.3 million\nequivalent as grants to LGUs.\nTable 2:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\n Foreign    Local  Total\nSource Exchange Currency   Cost Percent\nA.

LBP has requested a loan of \u00a53,676,050,000 (equivalent to $30.0 million) from ADB\u2019s\nordinary capital resources to finance the Project. The loan will have an 18-year term, including a\ngrace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent,\nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan\nAgreement, the Loan Regulations, ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms and\nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government and LBP have provided ADB\nwith (i) the reasons for LBP\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on\nthe basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the\nLBP\u2019s own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice\n                                                \n34  The Project was prepared substantially during 1999 and 2000, envisioning complete processing by 2000.\nTherefore, it is proposed that the cost-sharing limit applicable to the Republic of the Philippines in year 2000, i.e,\n50 percent, be applied to this project.\n35  As one of the conditions for ADB loan negotiation, the Credit Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines\nand NDF was executed on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, and all conditions precedent to  its\neffectiveness were fulfilled.\n36  Generated from the money market and deposits.", "16\nfrom ADB. NDF\u2019s credit carries no interest and has a 40-year maturity, including a 10-year\ngrace period, but has a 0.75 percent charge on the disbursed amount and a 0.5 percent\ncommitment fee on the undisbursed amount. LBP subloans to LGUs will have a fixed interest\nrate, with a maximum maturity of 15 years, including a  3-year grace period, coinciding with the\nprevailing terms used by the Government for LGU financing. LBP will reflect ADB\u2019s lending rate\nat  the  time  of  subloan  drawdown  to  minimize  the  interest  rate  risk.  The  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines will guarantee the proposed loan to LBP at 1 percent fee annually and will cover the\nforeign exchange risk at a yearly fee of 4 percent.\n51. The financing mix for part A is based on the use of (i) loan proceeds, (ii) LBP funds, (iii)\nDILG grants, and (iv) LGUs\u2019 counterpart funds to finance the cost of the subprojects. The\nparticipating LGU will use its own counterpart funds for activities such as preparing the detailed\nengineering  design,  acquiring  land,  and  other  preparatory  actions.  On  average,  about  14\npercent of a component cost is expected to be financed from LGU\u2019s own fund, 18 percent from\nLBP resources, 56 percent from ADB loan proceeds, and the remaining balance of 12 percent\nfrom the DILG Government grant.\n52. To  encourage  the  development  of  Mindanao  Urban  LGUs,  the  proposed  Project\nprovides grants. More incentives to participate will be given to lower-income than to higher-\nincome  LGUs  by  providing  a  high  level  of  grant  financing.  Also,  nonrevenue-generating\ncomponents will receive a grant 5 percent higher  than that for revenue-generating components.\nThe cost-sharing arrangements are given in Table 3. DILG grants will be channeled mainly to\nlow-income LGUs. LGUs in classes III-VI may receive grants up to 25 percent of the cost of\nnonrevenue-generating components and up to 20 percent of the cost of revenue-generating\ncomponents. Upon receiving proof that funds from all other sources have been committed,\nDILG, using the government depository bank (LBP), will disburse the grants to the LGUs. The\nflow of grant funds is presented in Appendix 7.\nTable 3: Cost- Sharing Arrangements\nRelending Government LGU Total\nLGU Class and (ADB: 75 % Grant Equity Cost\nComponent Type LBP : 25 %) (%) (%) (%)\nHigh-Income LGUs (Class I  to II)\nRevenue-Generating 80 0 20 100\nNonrevenue-Generating 75 5 20 100\nLow-Income LGUs (Class III to VI)\nRevenue-Generating 70 20 10 100\nNonrevenue-Generating 65 25 10 100\n53. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to LBP will be relent to LGUs through subsidiary loan\nagreements, satisfactory to ADB. The relending rate will be fixed for the term of the subloans\nfunded by ADB, and will be set at the time of subloan drawdown on the basis of the sum of\nADB\u2019s prevailing interest rate, foreign exchange risk premium (4 percent), and guarantee fee (1\npercent); and LBP\u2019s spread (2 percent up to 5 percent maximum based on LGU\u2019s credit rating).\nThe relending rate for subloans funded by LBP\u2019s internal funds will be at the market rate subject\nto repricing.37 The Government grant from DILG to LGUs will be established through subproject\nagreements.\n                                                \n37  Based on the 91-day T-bill rate, plus LBP spread of 1.5 percent.", "17\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization and Management\n54. Appendix  8  gives  the  organization  chart  for  project  implementation.  The  major\nresponsibilities and roles of the participating agencies and organizations are outlined below.\n55. LBP, the EA for part A, will relend to LGUs who will implement the physical investment.\nDILG, the EA for part B, will facilitate and monitor project implementation and oversee capacity\nbuilding. As joint EAs, LBP and DILG will coordinate the activities through the Technical Review\nand Coordinating Committee (TRCC). Each LGU will set up a PIU. PIUs for the three core pilot\nLGUs have already been established.\n56. A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  comprising  senior  officials  or  designated\nrepresentatives from LBP, DILG, and other government agencies38 has been established to\nprovide overall guidance to the Project and address policy issues. The PSC is chaired by the\nsecretary of DILG (or his designated representative) and will meet quarterly. A TRCC chaired by\nthe Executive Vice-President of LBP (or his designated representative) and comprising senior\nofficials from LBP, DILG, and other government agencies39 has also been created to coordinate\nproject implementation on a monthly basis. The regional DILG offices and LBP lending centers\nin Mindanao will assist in project dissemination and promotion, in coordination with LGUs. The\nProgram Management Department (PMD) under LBP is the secretariat of TRCC.\n57. LBP has established PMD to administer the LGU lending facility for part A, and assign a\nteam of qualified staff at the head office to establish the facility. A designated staff with suitable\nqualifications will coordinate with LBP offices in Mindanao, the PDO of DILG, and PIUs of\nparticipating  LGUs  to  (i)  appraise  subproject  feasibility  studies,  (ii)  prepare  Project-related\naccounting  and  auditing  activities,  and  (iii)  monitor  disbursements  for  the  infrastructure\ninvestment component. PMD, in coordination with the lending centers, will conduct appraisal,\nand  TRCC  will  review  the  subproject  appraisal  for  the  proposed  components  against  the\neligibility criteria and endorse qualified subprojects.\n58. DILG has established PDO with a team of qualified staff, including a financial accountant\nat headquarters to manage part B and develop subprojects for part A. PDO will carry out day-to-\nday project management and coordination with LBP. It will (i) manage, coordinate, facilitate, and\nmonitor overall implementation; (ii) promote project awareness and prepare feasibility studies\nfor  the  subprojects;  (iii)  coordinate  and  prepare  Project-related  reports;  (iv)  assist  the\nparticipating LGUs in recruiting consultants for detailed engineering design; and (v) hire and\nsupervise consultants for building the capacity of LGUs and strengthening DILG. Advisory\nconsultant teams will be divided into two main teams to support PDO. For overall project\nmanagement, a project management team will be established in PDO, while a subproject\npreparation and implementation support (SPIS) team will be located in DILG regional offices in\nMindanao. The project management team will coordinate and supervise the SPIS team. The\nSPIS  team  will  prepare  subproject  feasibility  studies;  promote,  facilitate,  and  develop\nsubprojects; and give hands-on assistance to LGUs, particularly those from the low-income\nclasses, in preparing feasibility studies. The SPIS team is composed of DILG regional staff and\nconsultants, and will work closely with LGUs in Mindanao. The SPIS will coordinate with PDO\nand PIUs of the participating LGUs in the region.\n                                                \n38 At least assistant secretary level, from DBM, NEDA, DOF, DPWH, DENR, and HUDCC.\n39 NEDA, DOF, DBM, DPWH, DENR, and HUDCC will be represented in the TRCC to review and endorse to LBP\nsubprojects costing more than $2.5 million.", "18\n59. LGUs will be responsible for preparing and implementing all physical components. Each\nLGU will set up a PIU. Each LGU will appoint a suitably qualified full-time subproject manager to\ndirect the implementation of each subproject and to undertake reporting, benefit monitoring, and\nevaluation. A sufficient number of staff from the concerned LGUs will be assigned to the PIUs to\nimplement their subprojects and to carry out procurement and construction supervision. With\nLGU  counterpart  funds,  the  PIUs  will  hire  a  team  of  domestic  consultants  for  detailed\nengineering  design.  The  domestic  consultants  will  prepare  engineering  drawings  and  bid\ndocuments, and assist in prequalifying contractors and evaluating bids, civil work contracts, and\nprocurement contracts; supervise contracts; and exercise quality control.\n60. To ensure effective implementation of the capacity-building component, the Government\nwill guarantee the performance of obligations by the various government agencies according to\nthe  project  design.  For  this  purpose,  DILG  issued  a  Commitment  Letter,  which  was\nacknowledged by DOF, as a representative of the Republic of the Philippines. Further, the\nRepublic of the Philippines will enter into Guarantee and Project Implementation Agreements\nwith ADB. The Commitment Letter was executed, on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB,\nand included the following:\n(i)  DILG  will  assume  project  execution  and  implementation  functions  in\ncoordination with the Borrower,\n(ii) DILG will contribute $6 million equivalent for grants to qualified LGUs and\n$1.3 million equivalent for the ICBP, and\n(iii) DILG will execute part B under the agreement between NDF and ADB.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n61. The Project will be implemented over six years, starting in January 2002 and ending by\n31 December 2007 (Appendix 9). About 40 subprojects will be prepared in three batches over\nthe first 2.5 years. The third batch of subprojects will be implemented from the third year\nonward. Given the small size of the investments, a subproject is expected to be implemented in\nabout three years.\n3. Subproject Application, Selection, Preparation, and Appraisal\n62. LGUs participating in the Project will (i) be urban LGUs with a population of at least\n20,000, (ii) express interest in and commitment to the Project, and (iii) have the financial\ncapacity to comply with LBP\u2019s credit rating system. LGUs satisfying these initial eligibility criteria\nwill submit a supporting letter from their LGU council to PDO, requesting that the LGU be\nallowed to participate in the Project. To qualify for the preparation of feasibility studies, LGUs\nwill (i) propose subprojects that have development potential and are consistent with the regional\nplan; (ii) propose subprojects for which there is demand, as substantiated by the local governing\nbody; (iii) have the technical, and administrative capacity to undertake capacity building; (iv) be\nendorsed by the Regional Development Council for the proposed subprojects; and (v) have\ncounterpart funds available and no adverse credit background. LGUs with readily available\nfeasibility studies can apply directly to PMD. PMD will prepare SPARs, and the SPIS team will\nassist PMD in preparing SPARs as part of the institutional capacity-building program.\n63. The investment components will be identified on the basis of needs and demands;\ntechnical, economic, and financial feasibility; and the LGU\u2019s financial and institutional capacity.\nThe criteria for appraising the subprojects will ensure that the needs of urban communities are\nidentified in the socioeconomic analysis and considered in prioritizing and designing investment\ncomponents. The detailed LGU eligibility selection criteria and subproject appraisal criteria are\npresented in Appendix 10.", "19\n64. The results of the appraisal will be contained in the SPAR; for small subprojects (costing\nless than $0.5 million) the SPAR can be a summary report; for subprojects costing more than\n$0.5 million a full report will be prepared. TRCC will review the SPARs and endorse those that\nconform to the project design criteria and are within the financial capacity of the LGUs. LBP will\nreview  and  endorse  the  proposed  subloan.  DILG  will  review  and  endorse  the  proposed\nsubproject for grants. The first three subprojects financed under the loan and any subproject\ncosting more than $2.5 million equivalent will require ADB approval before LBP approves the\nsubloan. It is estimated that about four (or about 10 percent) of the subprojects are expected to\ncost  above  $2.5  million.  Loan  review  missions  will  review  selected  subprojects  during\nimplementation.\n4. Detailed Engineering Design and Construction Supervision\n65. Detailed  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision  for  subprojects  will  be\nfinanced by the counterpart funds of the LGUs concerned. Domestic engineering consulting\nfirms will be hired by the PIUs, in consultation with the LGUs concerned and PDO, following\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. PDO will finalize the shortlist and invite technical proposals from\nthe shortlisted firms. PIUs will evaluate the proposals, select firms, and enter into contracts for\nthe required services. PDO will provide overall guidance and technical support in preparing the\ndetailed engineering designs, and will evaluate the final designs for each physical component.\nFor  subprojects  costing  more  than  $2.5  million,  ADB  will  review  the  terms  of  reference,\nevaluation criteria, service contracts, and evaluation results to ensure the competence and\nexperience of the selected consultant.\n5. Consulting Services\n66. For part A, domestic consultants, to be financed by the counterpart funds of the LGUs\nwill be recruited by each PIU for the LGU concerned following procedures acceptable to ADB.\nAll consulting services under part B will be financed from the NDF fund with a counterpart\ncontribution from DILG. For part B, consultants will be selected and engaged of in accordance\nwith the general procurement guidelines of NDF, with ADB\u2019s approval of terms of reference,\nevaluation criteria, evaluation results, selection and award of contract. It is estimated that 644\nperson-months of consulting services (130 international, and 514 domestic) will be required.\nConsultants will assist in implementing the Project (257 person-months) and provide support in\ninstitutional development and capacity building (387 person-months). The project management\nconsultants will assist in reviewing the design and contract documents, and will assist PDO in\nsubproject  development,  coordination,  monitoring,  and  evaluation,  and  in  the  financial  and\nenvironmental  aspects  of  overall  project  implementation.  The  subproject  preparation  and\nimplementation support consultants will work closely with PIUs in preparing subproject feasibility\nstudies,  reviewing  detailed  engineering  designs,  preparing  supplementary  technical\ndocumentation, assisting subproject managers, and preparing progress reports.\n6. Advance Action\n67. ADB  has  approved  advance  action  in  recruiting  consultants  and  preparing  detailed\nengineering designs and contract documents for the overall Project, starting with the pilot LGUs\nin Parang, Kidapawan, and Dipolog.\n7. Procurement\n68. Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured according to ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement applicable to loans to development finance institutions for relending\nto subborrowers. As loan administrator, LBP must satisfy ADB that (i) subborrowers followed", "20\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB; (ii) goods and services financed with the subloan\nproceeds were purchased at a reasonable price, considering other relevant factors such as\ntiming and efficiency of delivery, reliability of the goods and their suitability for the subproject,\nand availability of maintenance and spare parts; and (iii) all goods and services financed under\nthe loan were procured from ADB member countries. LBP will require subborrowers to follow\ninternational competitive bidding procedures for civil works contracts worth over $2 million and\nsupply  contracts  worth  over  $500,000,  and  where  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency\ndictates. The indicative contract packages is shown in Appendix 11. To promote compliance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, LBP and DILG project managers and other selected\nstaff will be trained and briefed on procurement as appropriate. Goods and services financed by\nNDF will be procured according to the general procurement guidelines of NDF.\n8. Resettlement and Land Acquisition\n69. A resettlement plan for a core subproject was prepared by the pilot LGU assisted by the\nconsultants (Appendix 12), in accordance with Government procedures and ADB's policy on\ninvoluntary resettlement. The plan will be a model for other subprojects that involve involuntary\nresettlement, land acquisition, and removal of other private and public assets. The resettlement\nplan ensures the following:\n(i) LGUs will be responsible for all land acquisition and ensure the timely acquisition\nor  availability  of  all  land  or  rights-of-way  required  for  subprojects  to  avoid\nunnecessary delays in construction.\n(ii) If a subproject component requires land acquisition or resettlement or both, the\nLGU  should  submit  the  resettlement  plan  for  ADB's  review  and  approval  to\nensure that it includes mitigating measures to restore or enhance the social and\neconomic base of the affected persons. An initial report in this regard will be\nprepared at the time of subproject identification and updated at each succeeding\nstage of subproject preparation (feasibility study, detailed design).\n(iii)  The Government, through DILG and DENR, will ensure that LGUs require all\ncontractors to restore temporarily acquired land to a condition suitable for its\noriginal purpose.\n(iv)  PDO consultants will monitor land acquisition, resettlement, and socioeconomic\nrehabilitation and reports for each subproject will be submitted to ADB before a\nsubloan can take effect. The results of the resettlement will be reported upon its\ncompletion and one year after that.\n9. Disbursement\n70. Loan proceeds will be disbursed according to procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook, January 2001. To facilitate the disbursement of small expenditures under the loan to\nLBP, the latter will set up an imprest account of $2.0 million exclusively for the Project. The\naccount  will  be  replenished  and  liquidated  on  the  basis  of  the  statement  of  expenditures\nprepared by LBP lending centers in Mindanao and consolidated at the LBP head office. The\nceiling  for  individual  payment  claims  in  the  statement  of  expenditure  is  $100,000  per\nexpenditure item. For force account works, LBP should use the reimbursement procedure, not\nthe statement of expenditure procedure. NDF will administer the disbursement of the NDF fund\nproceeds to DILG. ADB\u2019s Projects department will be notified of drawdown requests made by\nDILG to NDF, and disbursement will require ADB\u2019s prior approval.", "21\n10. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n71. DILG,  LBP,  and  the  LGUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to\ndocument the funds sources and expenditure for goods and services, including counterpart\nfunds provided in cash or in kind. DILG and LBP will (i) have the project accounts, records, and\nfinancial statements of PDO and PMD audited annually, according to sound auditing principles,\nby auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB;\nand (ii) submit to ADB, within nine months from the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the\nauditor\u2019s report on the consolidated project accounts and financial statements, including the\nauditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the ADB loan proceeds, compliance with financial covenants,\nand provision of counterpart funds. The imprest account and statement of expenditure are also\nsubject to annual audit. The audit report should include a separate audit opinion on the use of\nthe  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure.  LBP  will  submit  its  unaudited  financial\nstatements, provided by Mindanao lending centers of LBP,  to ADB within three months from the\nend of the fiscal year. In addition, DILG and LBP will jointly submit to ADB semiannual progress\nreports  on  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  cover  physical  performance,  summary\nprofiles  of  feasibility  studies,  summary  SPARs,  and  progress  made  in  the  DILG  capacity-\nbuilding program. Within three months after a subproject is completed, LBP and DILG will\nprepare and submit to ADB a subproject completion report for each LGU, summarizing the\noverall status of subproject implementation and operational performance. Within six months\nafter the end of the Project, DILG and LBP will prepare and submit to ADB a completion report\nsummarizing the overall status of project implementation, operational performance, the targets\nachieved under the Project, and PPMS.\n11. Anticorruption Measures\n72. The proposed Project will comply with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and guidelines. EAs\nwill ensure the timely submission of audited project accounts. Subprojects will be selected,\ncomponents  approved,  and  goods  and  services  procured  according  to  the  agreed-upon\nguidelines and criteria.\n12. Midterm Review\n73. A midterm review will be carried out about three years after the ADB loan effectiveness\nto enable the Government and LBP to make the needed adjustments in project design and\nimplementation arrangements. The review will cover the status of subproject preparation and\nimplementation, performance of consultants, subprojects in the pipeline, assistance to LGUs in\ninstitution and capacity building, and possible reallocation of loan proceeds.\n13. Project Performance Monitoring System\n74. Each  participating  LGU  will  implement  a  PPMS  for  each  completed  subproject  to\nevaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  benefits  accrued.  With  the  help  of\nconsultants, PDO will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans according to ADB\nguidelines.  The  PPMS  activities-establishing  benchmarks,  collecting  information,  monitoring\nbenefits,  and  evaluating  social  impact-will  be  undertaken  by  the  project  LGUs.  PDO  will\nconsolidate data and prepare a PPMS for the overall Project. The first set of data will be\ncollected within three months after the start of a subproject. The results will be included in the\nsubproject completion report to be prepared by LGUs and eventually in the project completion\nreport to be prepared jointly by DILG and LBP.", "22\nF. Executing and Implementing Agencies\n1. Land Bank of the Philippines\n75. LBP  will  be  the  EA  for  part  A  of  the  Project.  LBP,  a  wholly  Government-owned\ndevelopment finance institution established in 1963, has built up relevant capacity for LGU\nfinancing while implementing five ADB-supported projects.40 Its social mission is to promote\ncountryside development. It has been a major contributor to rural credit delivery, assisting in\nimplementing  the  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program.  This  mandate  was  later\nbroadened to include universal banking. LBP is exempt from the public service compensation\nsystem of the Government. 41\n76. LBP\u2019s total asset base increased by 5.56 percent to P210 billion, while its deposit base\nrose  by  7.0  percent  to  P152  billion  in  FY2000.  As  of  end-2000,  the  five  largest  sectors\ncomprising LBP\u2019s loan portfolio were farmers and fisherfolk cooperatives, P12.5 billion; small\nand medium-scale enterprises, P11.4 billion; government-owned and controlled corporations\nand government agencies, P19.7 billion; LGUs, P7.5 billion; and infrastructure development,\nP9.4 billion. LBP is managed by a board of nine directors comprising the secretary of finance,\nLBP president, and secretaries of agrarian reform, agriculture, and labor. As of 2001, LBP has a\nstaff of 8,466 nationwide, and has 38 branches, 1,000 personnel and 10 area-lending centers in\nMindanao. LBP is now one of the top five banks in the Philippines. LBP is the most active GFI in\nLGU lending, as reflected by a negligible past-due rate. Its outstanding loan portfolio of P7.5\nbillion benefits 281 LGUs nationwide, primarily by meeting their infrastructure needs.\n77. In the third quarter of 2000, LBP started a major reorganization and its management\nstructure has been streamlined. The functions of the local government financial services unit\nwere distributed as follows; implementation and credit approval processes were put under the\nagrarian and domestic banking sector, while the product development responsibilities were\ntransferred to the financial products development and evaluation group. During the second\nquarter of 2001, PMD has been set up directly under the Executive Vice President of agrarian\nand domestic banking sector. The PMD will supervise the implementation of foreign and locally\nfunded projects and programs, among others. As the LGU financing functions were distributed\nand decentralized, lending centers throughout the country will undertake the financial appraisal\nof proposed subprojects and administer the LGU loans. The SPIS team from PDO will support\nstrengthening of staff expertise on subproject appraisal.\n78. LBP\u2019s finances were affected by the Asian financial crisis. To protect its asset quality\nfrom the effects of the regionwide crisis, LBP since 1999 has provided provisions for bad loans\nmore than 20 times higher than the precrisis level. As a result, its asset quality position has\nimproved, and its loans-to-deposits ratio has declined from 87 percent in 1998 to 75 percent in\n2000, reflecting improvement of liquidity. These measures to achieve respectable asset quality\nand liquidity have, however, lowered LBP\u2019s profitability. Return on assets (ROA) fell from 1.2\npercent in 1997 to 0.6 percent in 1998, and was 0.3 percent at the end of 1999. By the end of\n2000, ROA was around 0.2 percent. While its agrarian lending also constitutes a drag on its\n                                                \n40  Loan 1216-PHI: Small Farmers Credit Project; for $75.0 million, approved on 22 December 1992; Loan 1664-PHI:\nMetro Manila Air Quality Improvement (Air Pollution Control Facility); for $25.0 million, approved on 16 December\n1998; TA Loan 1729-PHI: LGU Private Infrastructure Project Development Facility; for $3.0 million, approved on\n20 December 1999; Loan 1163-PHI: Mt. Pinatubo Damage Rehabilitation Project, for $37.0 million, approved on\n23 April 1992; and Loan 1435-PHI(SF): Rural Microenterprise Credit Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 23\nApril 1996.\n41  Further  details  of  the  organization  and  financial  statements  of  LBP  are  in  Appendix  13  as  well  as  in\nSupplementary Appendix G.", "23\nprofitability,42 the sudden drop in ROA during 1999 and 2000 is not necessarily due to its\nagrarian  lending.  The  increase  in  its  provisions  for  bad  loans  during  1999  and  2000  is\nattributable to high levels of delinquency in its commercial lending. LBP provided an action plan\nfor  reducing  its  nonperforming  portfolio  and  improving  its  profitability  by  restructuring\nnonperforming loans and injecting more capital. Due diligence result indicates LBP\u2019s projected\nROA for 2001 will be 0.6 percent, under the action plan provided by LBP. However, it was not\nfeasible for LBP to comply with the financial covenant for TA Loan 1729-PHI (footnote 22) in\n2000, in which the minimum ROA is set at 0.55 percent for 2000. The financial covenants under\nits existing loans with ADB (i.e., the LGU Private Infrastructure Project Development Facility, the\nAir Pollution Control Facility, and the Small Farmers Credit Project [footnote 40]) need to be\namended to correspond to the proposed financial covenants under this Project [para. 106 (v)].\n79. To ensure the financial viability of the LBP loan and sound financial management, it has\nbeen agreed that LBP will maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent as required by the\ncentral bank of the Philippines, and provide solid provisioning to safeguard its asset quality\nposition. The current financial status of LBP and the agreed-upon summary action plan are\ndiscussed in Appendix 13.\n2. Department of the Interior and Local Government\n80. DILG will be the EA for part B of the Project. DILG is the line department of the\nGovernment that is responsible for developing the capability of local governments to deliver\neffective basic services. Aside from its regional and field offices, DILG has an Office of Project\nDevelopment Services, which develops and monitors foreign-assisted projects and programs.\nDILG is now implementing three ADB-funded projects,43 and is gaining valuable lessons in the\nprocess. Consulting assistance in project management will help DILG to satisfactorily perform\nits implementation functions and roles. The Government recently proposed further amendments\nin the LGC provisions, strengthening the fiscal capacities and powers devolved to LGUs. The\ninstitutional and capacity-building approach of the proposed Project will support the Government\npolicy of enabling urban sector institutions to perform better and in a sustainable manner.\n3. Local Government Units\n81. As  implementing  agency,  a  participating  LGU  will  establish  a  PIU  for  subproject\nimplementation.  The  LGC  of  1991  represented  a  major  shift  in  public  administration  by\ndevolving to LGUs various functions previously carried out by the national Government and\nempowering them to operate with a greater degree of autonomy. LGUs now have the primary\nresponsibility for guiding, financing, and managing urban development. Although the experience\nand  capacity  of  individual  LGUs  in  carrying  out  the  devolved  functions  are  varied,  it  is\nreasonable to say that over the years all LGUs have gained some experience in planning,\nimplementing, and managing investments. LGUs organizational structure and staffing patterns\nare  also  varied,  depending  on  the  class  and  size  of  its  revenues44  (some  lower-class\nmunicipalities have only a staff of 60 while some first class cities have over 1,300). PIUs will be\n                                                \n42 Without the mandated Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses, LBP would have registered an ROA of\n1.1 percent, which is on par with the average for its peer banks in the Philippines.\n43 Footnotes 16, 17, and 18.\n44 According to a Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum, every LGU will design and implement its own\nstructure and staffing, considering its service requirements and financial capability, subject to the minimum\nstandards and guidelines prescribed by CSC. The guidelines set the limit to staff by imposing a staff salaries\nbudget ceiling of 45 percent (for LGUs income class IV to VI ), and 55 percent (for LGUs income class IV to VI) of\nthe revenue in the preceding fiscal year. Maintenance and other operational expenses generally account for about\n25-35 percent of local expenditures.", "24\nestablished under each LGU\u2019s city planning and development office to be responsible for the\ndesigning and implementing the LGUs subproject. PDO will provide technical assistance and\nadvise implementation of subprojects. The Project will further improve the participating LGUs\ncapacity to guide the development process, and plan and implement investments.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Considerations\n82. An initial environmental examination was undertaken for core pilot subprojects. The\nGovernment has adequate laws and institutional framework for environmental screening and\nmonitoring  of  subprojects  of  the  size  and  complexity  to  be  undertaken  under  the  Project.\nEnvironmental impact assessment (EIA; the Government uses the term environmental impact\nstatement) will be prepared for subprojects as required by the Government\u2019s EIA procedures\nand by ADB\u2019s environmental policies and procedures. After the Environmental Management\nBureau of DENR approves the initial environmental examination or EIA, the summary reports\nwill be sent to ADB for approval. Disbursements for the subprojects will be contingent on the\nissuance of an environmental compliance certificate by the Government and clearance by ADB.\nMitigating measures, design changes, or monitoring systems required in answer to conditions\nstated in the environmental compliance certificate will be incorporated in the detailed design and\nimplementation  of  the  subproject.  An  environmental  assessment  training  seminar  for\nparticipating  LGUs  will  enable  them  to  properly  carry  out  environmental  assessment  and\nmonitoring for the subprojects. The Government has agreed to include appropriate measures in\nthe design of each subproject to address environmental concerns during construction and\noperation. The cost of preparing an initial environmental examination or EIA will be covered by\nthe LGU.\n2. Social Considerations and Community Participation\n83. A social analysis was undertaken for core subprojects. Direct views of the community\nconcerned  were  obtained  and  reflected  in  subprojects  formulation.  For  participating  LGUs,\nsocial assessment and analysis will be conducted following Government policy and ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations  (1994).  Subproject\ncomponents will be selected and prioritized by LGUs in a participatory manner involving as wide\na cross section of the community as possible. For a subproject that affects an ethnic minority or\nindigenous  people  adversely  and  significantly,  an  indigenous  people  development  plan\nacceptable to ADB will be prepared and submitted for ADB\u2019s review.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. General\n84. The Project will improve access to municipal services, quality of life, and environmental\nstandards for about 2 million people living in 40 LGUs, including about 0.8 million urban poor.\nThe extent of the benefit will depend on the type of investment. Aside from improvements in the\nphysical urban infrastructure, the technical, operational, and financial management capacity of\nLGUs will be strengthened through the institutional development and capacity-building program.", "25\n85. Feasibility studies were made for five components in three core pilot LGUs during project\nformulation45:  (i)  The  proposed  water  supply  system  (Parang)  comprises  upgrading  water\nsources,  providing  new  transmission  mains,  constructing  pumping  stations,  improving  an\nexisting  treatment  plant,  building  new  water  storage,  and  a  distribution  system  for  house\nconnections. The proposed system is expected to cover 26,800 people in six communities. (ii) In\nDipolog, foreshore development includes a 340-meter-long sea protection wall and 1.4 hectares\nof serviced land for commercial use and public roads, drainage, and park facilities. (iii) The\nbypass roads in Dipolog are to widen and upgrade existing access roads to the southern part of\nthe urban area, a total of 2.5 kilometers. Kidapawan proposed to build (iv) additional bus\nterminals to accommodate 200 buses a day for the increased traffic in the town, and (v) a solid\nwaste management facility, including sanitary landfill site and improved collection system.\nB. Economic and Financial Analyses\n1.  Approach\n86. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were computed for all components. Cash flow\nprojections and financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) were calculated for revenue-generating\ncomponents for which costs are expected to be recovered directly from user charges, fees, and\ntariffs. A sensitivity analysis was also done. The domestic price numeraire was used in the\neconomic evaluation because project outputs are mainly nontradable. For valuation of tradable\ngoods, a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.22, based on the standard conversion factor of\n0.837, was used. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 was applied to the wage of unskilled labor at\nthe domestic price level.\n87. The financial evaluation of revenue-generating components examined the degree of cost\nrecovery from the investments and, hence, the financial sustainability of those investments.\nCapital expenditures (land, civil works, equipment, detailed engineering design and construction\nsupervision, and resettlement costs) were assumed to coincide with the life cycle costs and\nrevenues of the subproject. Revenues were estimated on the basis of the proposed user\ncharges for the new and improved facilities. In principle, user charges were set at a level that\nwould  cover  all  operation  and  maintenance  costs  plus  the  financial  costs  of  the  project\ncomponent. Prices (tariffs) are expected to increase over time to keep up with rising costs\n(inflation) and allow the proper operation of the proposed facilities over the life of the asset.\n2. Economic Analysis\n88. The water supply components in Parang will generate economic benefits in terms of (i)\nunmet  demand  for  piped  water  supply  services  in  the  municipality  concerned,  and  (ii)\nincremental water consumption by new water users. The least-cost analysis demonstrated the\nsubstantial benefits to the municipality from lower water costs. Many people in the subproject\narea now buy water at exorbitant rates from private water vendors or draw water from their own\ndeep wells, which are often unhygienic. The poor in particular will directly benefit from these\ncomponents.\n89. Economic  benefits  from  the  foreshore  development  component  are  improved  living\nconditions,  employment  opportunities,  and  environmental  sanitation  of  the  foreshore  area.\nFinancial benefits and costs were adjusted for their shadow values. The high EIRR of the\nproposed foreshore development in Dipolog is due mainly to the relatively low project costs.\n                                                \n45 Summaries of subproject appraisals are in Supplementary Appendixes A, B, and C.", "26\nHowever, the resettlement program in Dipolog will maximize the economic benefits from this\ncomponent.\n90. For the bypass road component, vehicle operating cost savings for direct potential road\nusers, including reduced maintenance costs and savings in travel time for passengers and\ngoods, were considered. For the bus terminal, users\u2019 willingness to pay for improved bus\nterminal and stalls was considered in estimating economic benefits.\n91. The major indicators of the economic viability of the core subprojects are summarized in\nAppendix 14. All the components are economically viable. The base EIRRs of 14-38 percent are\nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12 percent). When subjected to sensitivity\nanalysis, the EIRRs were generally robust, while those for the bus terminal were sensitive to\nchanges in both cost and benefits.\n3. Financial Analysis\n92. For upgraded services, the full cost will be charged, but within the level that consumers\nare willing to pay.46 User charges for the terminal in Kidapawan will be raised substantially to\nmake the project viable.\n93. For the water supply components, water tariffs were analyzed in view of the results of\nthe socioeconomic survey. For example, residential consumers in Parang now pay an average\nof P60 per cubic meter for water from water vendors. Once the improved water system is in\nplace, they would pay P12 per cubic meter. At these tariff levels, households could increase\ntheir consumption of water to over 120 liters per person per day on the average, with significant\nhealth and economic benefits, while still keeping within the current level of affordability. For\nforeshore development, the financial analysis focused on the city\u2019s options of leasing or selling\nthe developed area for commercial use.\n94. All components are expected to meet all operating costs, including debt servicing, after\nthey start operations. Financial analysis shows that they will be financially viable. The FIRRs of\n13-30 percent exceed the weighted average financial cost of capital for relending (about 6\npercent in constant term). When subjected to sensitivity analysis, the FIRRs were generally still\nrobust, except in the case of bus terminals, and at a level with the weighted average financial\ncost of capital. The financial evaluation is summarized in Appendix 14.\n4. LGUs\u2019 Borrowing Capacity\n95. The financial statements, balance sheets, and revenue and expenditure forecasts of\nthree pilot LGUs were examined during project preparation to gauge their financial capability.\nLGUs, particularly municipalities, derive their revenues principally from the IRA and secondarily\nfrom local sources. Each year over the last five years, the IRA and locally generated revenues\nachieved average real growth rates of 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\n96. The past performance of the LGUs would seem to support a 10 percent yearly increase\nin real prices in IRA and local revenue taxes, and a 5 percent yearly increase in real prices in\nnontax revenues. The cash flow projections indicate that for the proposed  investments, all three\nLGUs have the capacity to borrow for the proposed investments, up to 20 percent of their\nregular  income,  as  required  by  LGC.  The  projected  financial  statements  for  2001\u20132015\n                                                \n46  Socioeconomic household surveys in the subproject areas ascertained affordability and willingness to pay for\nrevenue-generating components.", "27\n(Appendix 14) also indicate improvements in the financial condition of LGUs over the medium\nterm.\nC. Impact on Poverty\n97. Poverty incidence in urban Mindanao is at least 15 percent higher than the national\naverage. The Project is designed to reduce regional development gap, and to promote equitable\ngrowth of Mindanao by targeting urban LGUs. Attention has been given to improve the living\nconditions  of  the  poor  and  in  the  LGUs  with  limited  local  resources.  Improving  urban\ninfrastructure and related services will not only enhance the productivity of urban economy but\nalso  benefit  the  poor  by  improving  their  living  standards,  and  by  providing  employment\nopportunities. Improvement of roads, bridges, or public markets that everybody can access will\ngenerally enhance the productivity of urban economic activities. A positive distributional effect to\nthe  urban  poor  is  expected.  The  urban  poor  will  also  benefit  directly  from  a  number  of\nsubprojects. For example, civil works of subprojects will hire unskilled laborers for construction,\nand provide employment and income-earning opportunities for the poor; or the water supply\nproject will substantially bring down household expenses spent for water vendors as well as\ntime spent in fetching water, resulting in real income savings for the poor.\n98. Under the sector approach, about 40 LGUs (or about 2 million population) are expected\nto receive benefits of the Project. More than 40 percent of beneficiaries fall below the poverty\nline. It is expected that about 0.8 million beneficiaries will be the urban poor. However, the\ndistributional impact on poverty will vary depending on the numbers and investment size of\nsubproject components across subsectors. Overall, the increased employment and income-\nearning opportunities during project implementation will be one of the substantial benefits to the\npoor. It is estimated that about 100,000 person-months of employment opportunities will be\ngenerated. Analysis of the socioeconomic survey demonstrates wide distribution of benefits\nfrom the subprojects throughout the project areas. The Project impact on poverty is presented in\nAppendix 15.\n99. However,  ensuring  equitable  access  of  the  urban  poor  communities  to  improved\nservices is a major social challenge. To address this, the proposed Project includes direct\nintervention and indirect incentive mechanisms to bring urban services for the poor. For direct\nintervention, subprojects are required to adopt direct participation and representation of the poor\nthrough a community participatory planning approach when the LGU prioritizes investment\nneeds. Indirect incentive mechanism is included as up to 25 percent of grant financing for a\ncomponent such as sanitation, drainage, and flood protection measures, from which the poor\nliving in flood-prone areas will benefit significantly. The grant financing from the Government\nprovides incentives for low-income LGUs to invest in a nonrevenue-generating component for\npositive environmental and distributional benefits from infrastructure services.\nD. Social Dimensions\n100. Appendix 15 outlines social impact assessment. The proposed Project provides for basic\ninfrastructure such as roads, markets, water supply, drainage or other social infrastructure\nservices  to  support  the  overall  level  of  economic  and  social  well  being.  The  levels  of\ninfrastructure services in the targeted LGUs are lower than the National average. Therefore, the\nProject serves both short- and long-term development needs. In addition, the proposed Project\nwill have a direct as well as an indirect impact on employment and income generation. The\nconstruction of most of the basic urban infrastructure and services will be labor-intensive and\nwill require low-skilled workers who can come from the ranks of the urban poor. Bus terminals\nand  roads  will  improve  access  to  economic  centers  in  towns  with  public  markets  and\nslaughterhouses.", "28\n101. Improving the provision of water supply, sanitation, roads, solid waste disposal, and\nother infrastructure will also lead to better health, enhance the quality of life, and save time.\nPeople living in communities that will be supplied with water facilities for the first time will spend\nless time transporting water. The time they save can be used in other activities. Women, who\ntogether with children suffer most from poor living conditions in urban areas, are not the specific\ntargets  of  the  Project,  but  they  will  benefit  from  improved  living  conditions  as  a  result  of\nimproved infrastructure. Gender considerations are built into the Project to equalize access to\nthe  benefits  from  poverty  reduction  and  employment  creation,  and  to  ensure  that  project\nplanning and implementation take the needs of the whole community into account.\nE. Environment\n102. Subprojects will have a positive environmental impact. They will repair, upgrade, or\nreplace  failing  or  inadequate  infrastructure  and  public  facilities,  and  will  therefore  improve\nhealth, quality of life, sanitation, and environmental conditions. Five components in three pilot\ncore LGUs were selected for environmental assessment: (i) the Miputak-Torne bypass road and\nforeshore development in Dipolog, (ii) the water supply and distribution upgrade in Parang, and\n(iii)  bus  and  jeepney  terminal  and  solid  waste  disposal  facilities  in  Kidapawan.  Initial\nenvironmental examinations, prepared for each of the subprojects in the three pilot LGUs,47\nrevealed that none of the pilot subprojects were located in an environmentally sensitive area,\nand any adverse environmental effects would be minor and easily mitigated.\nF. Risks\n103. Risks that could affect the overall success of the Project have been identified. The main\nrisk  comes  from  the  civil  strife  in  Mindanao.  The  Peace  Agreement  signed  in  1996  is  a\nsignificant step in the long peace process, and has led to significantly improved peace and\norder. However, sporadic conflicts still occur in the rural areas. The safety issue may therefore\nmake inspection of progress difficult in some of the subproject areas - as land travel through the\nrural area would be risky\u2013and, to some extent, affect project implementation.\n104. Other project risks include potential lack of interest among LGUs in participating in the\nProject; lower than expected LGU financial resources; implementation delays, particularly at\nstart-up, due to delay in creating PIUs, or in recruiting consultants; shortcomings in subproject\npreparation  and  appraisal  that  could  reduce  the  desired  socioeconomic  benefits;  lack  of\ncommitment to institutional development; and continued shortage of services for the poor. Also,\na subproject started under one mayor of an LGU may not necessarily be completed by the\nsubsequent mayor.\n105. To minimize these risks, the design and implementation arrangements for the Project\nhave the following features: (i) a modest-size Project has been formulated to minimize the\nfinancial burden on the national Government and LGUs; (ii) a consultant recruited directly by\nDILG  with  NDF  finance  will  assist  in  starting  up  the  Project  and  setting  up  project\nimplementation units; (iii) advance action for hiring consultants is in place; (iv) to participate in\nthe  Project,  LGUs  must  contribute  equity  and  counterpart  funds  and  be  committed  to\ninstitutional strengthening; (v) consultants will help prepare and strengthen subprojects; (vi)\ncommunities will take part in designing subprojects; and (vii) to reduce the risks of political\n                                                \n47 The results of the initial environmental examinations of core pilot subprojects are in Supplementary\nAppendix K.", "29\nsuccession in a given LGU, the grant financing will be disbursed at the last stage and LGU\u2019s\nequity contribution will be required at the beginning stage of a given subproject.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n106. The  Government,  LBP,  and  DILG  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in\naddition to the standard assurances that have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  LGU and subproject selection criteria. LBP will ensure that priority is given to\nlower-income LGUs so that LGUs from classes III to VI are at least 20 percent of\nthose that qualify for subloan financing. LBP will also see to it that LGUs and\nsubprojects qualify for subloan financing by meeting the following screening and\nselection criteria.\n(a)  An LGU passes the initial screening if it has a population of at least\n20,000; has no military conflict and is safe for construction; demonstrates\nfinancial capacity to borrow; and obtains a prime, high, or medium credit\nrating from LBP.\n(b)  To be selected for subloan financing, an LGU must have deficiencies in\ninfrastructure  and  demand  for  improvements,  commitment  to  the\nproposed subproject, no adverse credit background with LBP, available\nequity  and  willingness  to  contribute  to  the  financing  of  the  proposed\nsubproject,  and  technical  and  administrative  capacity  to  undertake\ninstitutional capacity building and subproject management;\n(c)  A  subproject  qualifies  for  subloan  financing  if  it  is  endorsed  by  the\ndesignated  representative  of  a  qualified  LGU  following  a  process  of\nconsultation,  conforms  to  all  the  relevant  government  laws,  and\nprocedures, will not have significant adverse effects on the environment,\nand  demonstrates  cost-efficiency  and  a  degree  of  technical\npreparedness.\n(ii) Counterpart funds. LBP and DILG will ensure that the counterpart funds needed\nfor project implementation are provided on time. To this end, LBP and DILG will\ntake  all  measures  necessary  or  appropriate  for  the  prompt  disbursement  of\nappropriated funds to the qualified LGUs. DILG will include in its subproject\nagreements with LGUs that appropriate operation and maintenance costs will be\nallocated to ensure sustainability of the infrastructure services.\n(iii) Social considerations. DILG will ensure that in prioritizing investments and in\nplanning  and  constructing  subprojects,  each  LGU  consults  with  community\nleaders  and  involves  community-based  organizations  and  informal  groups,\nincluding representatives from poor communities. Each LGU will also develop\nand implement a public information and education campaign to publicize the\ninvestment program and encourage community-based organizations and informal\ngroups  to  participate.  For  a  subproject  that  affects  an  ethnic  minority  or\nindigenous  people  adversely  and  significantly,  an  indigenous  people\ndevelopment plan acceptable to ADB must be prepared and submitted for ADB\u2019s\nreview.", "30\n(iv)  Performance measurement. DILG will ensure that the Local Productivity and\nPerformance Measurement Program is refined and further strengthened so that\nappropriate adjustments can be made and can be pilot-tested in measuring the\nperformance of the participating LGUs.\n(v)  Financial condition. LBP will ensure that it maintains\n(a)  a capital adequacy ratio of not less than 10 percent for 2001;\n(b)  a minimum return on assets of 0.55 percent in 2001, after expenses for\nthe  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program,  and  0.6  percent  for\nsubsequent years and later;\n(c)  a  minimum  coverage  ratio  of  95  percent  of  the  cumulative  loan  loss\nreserves to past due loans to cover its past due accounts with respect to\nagrarian loans, and a minimum coverage ratio of at least 50 percent of its\ntotal past due loans; and\n(d)  a loans-to-deposits ratio not exceeding 90 percent, and a minimum quasi-\nliquid ratio48 of 25 percent.\n(vi)  Environmental assurance. The Borrower will ensure that the subprojects will be\ncarried out in accordance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations\nof the Government and with ADB\u2019s environmental policies and procedures. A\ndetailed and summary EIA report or an initial environmental examination will be\nprepared for subprojects as applicable, and submitted to the Government for\napproval and to ADB for clearance. Disbursement for subloan agreements will be\nsubject to obtaining an environmental clearance certificate from the Government\nand clearance from ADB. The Borrower will further ensure that any contractual\nagreements entered into by a qualified LGU with any private sector entity for\nundertaking a subproject will include legally binding commitments, satisfactory to\nADB, that the subproject concerned will be implemented in accordance with the\napplicable environmental laws and regulations and with ADB\u2019s environmental\npolicies and procedures.\n(vii)  Resettlement and land acquisition.

Sector Investment Program\n1. The Project is formulated as a sector loan and will support a time slice (2002-2007) and\nan area slice (Mindanao urban local government units [LGUs]) of the Government\u2019s urban\ninfrastructure development. To assess the project contribution to Mindanao\u2019s urban investment\nprogram, the urban infrastructure investments of the cities/municipalities in Mindanao were\nestimated over a 10-year period (2001-2010) and the project period (2002-2007). LGU total\nrevenues and expenditure on capital works were forecasted. Table A4.1 sets out the 1998\ninternal revenue allocation (IRA) to Mindanao cities and municipalities along with the locally\ngenerated revenues. Revenues for 2001-2010 were estimated assuming an average annual\nreal growth rate of 9 percent for IRA and local revenues. A review of the municipal finances of\nthe three pilot LGUs indicated an annual average real growth rate of 11 percent for IRA and 10\npercent for locally generated revenues over 1994-1999. Thus, the assumed 9 percent growth for\nIRA and locally generated income is slightly lower than recent experience for the pilot LGUs.\nTable A4.1: Forecast of Mindanao LGUs Revenuesa\n(million)\nTotal IRA Local Income Total\nConstant 1998 P $ P $ P $\n1998 Mindanao LGUs Revenues\nCities   5,765 144 3,104   78   8,870 222\nMunicipalities   5,748 144 3,095   77   8,843 221\n         Total 11,513 288 6,199 155 17,713 443\nRevenues Forecast b\n2001 14,910 373 8,028 201 22,938 573\n2002 16,252 406 8,750 219 25,002 625\n2003 17,714 443 9,538 238 27,252 681\n2004 19,308 483 10,396 260 29,705 743\n2005 21,046 526 11,332 283 32,378 809\n2006 22,940 574 12,352 309 35,292 882\n2007 25,005 625 13,464 337 38,469 962\n2008 27,255 681 14,675 367 41,931  1,048\n2009 29,708 743 15,996 400 45,705  1,143\n2010 32,382 810 17,436 436 49,818  1,245\n                 Total (2001-2010)  226,552    5,663  121,967    3,049  348,489  8,712\nTotal revenues (2001-2010) 226,552 5,663 121,967 3,049 348,489  8,712\nTotal capital expenditures c 45,304 1,133 13,416 335 58,721  1,468\nUrban infrastructure d 22,652 566 6,708 167 29,360   733\nIRA = internal revenue allocation, LGU = local government unit.\na  \n Exchange rate at P40 per $1.0.\nb  Average annual (real) increase of 9 percent for IRA and for locally generated revenues.\nc  About 20 percent of IRA and 11 percent of local revenues is allocated to capital expenditures.\nd\n  An estimated 50 percent of total capital expenditures by cities and municipalities is allocated to urban infrastructure.\n2. Cities and municipalities are required to allocate at least 20 percent of their annual IRA\nto capital infrastructure. A review of the municipal accounts for the three pilot LGUs indicates\nthat they actually allocated about 31 percent of their total income (IRA plus locally generated\nrevenues) to capital expenditures over 1994-1999. Field investigations indicate that cities and\nmunicipalities spend an average 13 percent of their local revenues on capital infrastructure, in\naddition to 20 percent of the annual IRA. A lower value of 11 percent as a conservative estimate\nwas used for forecasting. Based on analysis in the pilot LGUs, it was further estimated that\nabout 50 percent of capital expenditures is in their urban areas as distinct from their rural area.\nThe total expenditures for urban capital infrastructure in Mindanao over the period 2001-2010 is\nthen estimated to be about P29 billion ($0.73 billion) as shown in Table A4.1.", "42 Appendix 4, page 2\n3. For the six year implementation period (2002-2007), total capital investment for the\nurban areas of Mindanao is estimated to be about $440 million. Excluding three large cities\n(Davao, General Santos, and Iligan) that are fully committed in terms of capital works over the\nforeseeable future, about $312 million would be required for the urban areas of Mindanao. The\nproposed project investment would account for 16 percent of the total urban infrastructure\ninvestment for the Mindanao urban LGUs over the project period (Table A4.2).\n                 Table A4.2: The Project Investment Slice\n$\nItem (million)\nTotal expenditure on urban infrastructure 2002-2007 440\nTotal expenditure excluding three large cities a 312\nProject investment      51.4\nProject investment as percentage of sector investment program\n2001-2010    7\n2002-2007  12\n2002-2007 (excluding three large cities)  16\na\n Davao, General Santos, and Iligan.\nB.  Previous and Existing Lending Facilities to Urban LGUs in Mindanao\n4. Urban areas in Mindanao in general and in the special zone for peace and development\n(SZOPAD) in particular, have in recent times not benefited to the same extent as other urban\nareas in the country from the funds for demand-driven urban sector development initiatives. The\nWorld Bank-assisted Program for Essential Municipal Infrastructure Utilities, Maintenance and\nEngineering Development projects (also known as municipal development projects [MDPs])\nhave been a significant source of national funding for LGUs for municipal infrastructure, service\nand facilities provision, and improvement. However, MDP I concentrated on LGUs outside a 50-\nkilometer radius of Metro Manila and MDP II restricted beneficiary LGUs to those outside the\nMetro Manila area. MDP I was closed in 1998, and MDP II fund is fully allocated currently (Table\nA4.3).\n5. Under MDP I, SZOPAD received 9.7 percent and Mindanao 17.3 percent of the funds.\nFrom MDP II, Mindanao as a whole received its fair allocation of investment of about 21.5\npercent, but SZOPAD received only 6.8 percent of the total amount of investment. For both\nMDP I and II, SZOPAD received a lower amount of funds compared with the rest of the country\n(based on the proportion of their respective urban populations). SZOPAD areas tend to be\nbehind in urban development from the perspective of funding accessibility.\n6. A summary of the analysis (Table A4.4) also indicates that existing lending facilities\n($66.3 million) can only satisfy 15 percent of the urban investment needs in Mindanao ($440\nmillion) over the next six years. A total of nine urban LGUs have participated in both MDP\nprojects,  and  two  cities\u2014Iligan  and  General  Santos\u2014are  also  benefiting  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Philippines Regional Municipal Development Project.1 The nine LGUs are\nall in class I and II, indicating that most urban LGUs in Mindanao have yet to benefit from a\nproject financing facility aimed at LGU investments in municipal infrastructure and services.\nThere is a need to establish an investment fund to which lower class LGUs in Mindanao can\nhave equitable access.\n                  \n1 Loan 1367-PHI: Regional Municipal Development Project, for $30 million, approved on 25 August 1995.", "43 Appendix 4, page 3\nTable A4.3: Participation in PREMIUMED Projects\nProject Beneficiary LGU Package $  (million)\nPREMIUMED I Digos, Davao del Sur 0.5\n(MDP I: closed in 1998) Dipolog City 1.0\nSZOPAD General Santos City 1.1\nIligan City 1.3\nPagadian City 0.2\nTotal SZOPAD 4.1 (9.7 percent of total)\nOther Mindanao 3.2\nTotal Mindanao 7.3 (17.3 percent of total)\nTotal Philippines 42.2\nPREMIUMED 2 Digos, Davao del Sur 0.5\n(MDP II: fully allocated) Dipolog City 1.8\nSZOPAD Manila, Davao del Sur 1.0\nSta.

The assistance will be conducted in such a way that both the LGU and the private\nstakeholders are involved at every step and that both groups are sufficiently empowered to\nperform their respective roles in the process. The component will emphasize not only the\npreparation of sound plans but also the introduction of an effective planning framework and\nsystem as a regular component of local governance immediately preceding the completion of\nthe  plans.  This  planning  framework  and  system  will  include  effective  implementation  and\nmonitoring strategies that proceed in an annual cycle with continuous improvement .\n2.  LGU Financial Resource Mobilization and Strategic Planning\n7. The objective will be to prepare a comprehensive strategic plan for mobilizing financial\nresources  for  the  participating  LGUs.  The  assistance  will  examine  appropriate  steps  for\nimproving  revenues  and  capital  budgeting  from  the  (i)  property  tax,  (ii)  user  charges  on\nmunicipal  services,  and  (iii)  nontraditional  sources  of  revenues,  to  improve  LGUs  fiscal\nperformance by following the principles of a corporate business plan.\n8.

Institutional Strengthening of DILG\n9. The local productivity and performance measurement developed by DILG is basically a\nself-assessment tool, providing local authorities a practical method in evaluating their service\ndelivery performance and identifying service improvement areas as well as determining the\nextent of improvements achieved. The local productivity and performance measurement for\nwider application needs further refinement, particularly in Mindanao. The long-term objective of\nthis  program  is  to  build  DILG\u2019s  capacity  to  undertake  local  productivity  and  performance\nmeasurement on a sustainable basis. The immediate objective of the assistance will be (i) to\nreview local productivity and performance measurement in light of the practical operational and\nvalue-added  applicability  of  the  system;  and  (ii)  to  assess/refine/develop  a  performance\nmanagement  and  monitoring  system  suitable  for  LGUs,  particularly  in  Mindanao,  through\niterative application processes over the project period. LGUs will use the assessment results to\nreduce performance gaps, and to devise corrective actions to improve public administration and\ngovernance under the local autonomy. Further, DILG will strengthen its capacity to monitor\nLGUs performance over the time horizon to improve its mandated role as an overseeing agency\nof LGU, under the local government code.\n10.

The  Project  will  cover  all  local  government  units  (LGUs)  in  income  classes  I-VI  in\nMindanao. Each subproject may have one or more basic urban infrastructure services and\nfacilities  (component)  for  one  LGU  (subborrower).  The  Project  adopts  a  demand-driven\napproach.\nA. LGUs Eligibility and Selection Criteria\n2. An LGU is eligible if (i) its minimum urban population is 20,000 in the year 2000, or is\nexpected to exceed 20,000 by 2002; (ii) there is no military conflict in the subproject location\nand construction is safe;  (iii) the LGU has a rating of either prime, high, or medium grade based\non  the  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (LBP)  \u2014  Local  Government  Financial  Credit  Rating\nSystem; in the case of lower-medium-grade LGUs, LBP management\u2019s approval is necessary;\nand (iv) the LGU can demonstrate financial capacity to borrow (20 percent of development fund\nfrom internal revenue allotment minus current debt services).\n3. For LGUs that meet the eligibility criteria, the following selection criteria will be applied:\n(i)  the  LGU  should  demonstrate  deficiencies  in  existing  infrastructure  and  demand  for\nimprovement  through  a  supporting  letter  from  the  Regional  Development  Council  of  the\nrespective regional offices of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) (or\nRegional Planning and Development Board for the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao\n[ARMM]), and local development council\u2019s resolution, endorsing the proposed subcomponents;\n(ii) the LGU should demonstrate interest and commitment, through a supporting letter from the\nmayor, to participate, modify, and adjust the local land use planning development plan and\nfinancial management system based on the recommendation of the capacity building program;\n(iii) the LGU must have the technical and administrative capacity to undertake institutional\ncapacity-building and subproject management, represented by (a) minimum staff numbers in\nplanning and engineering departments, (b) adequate financial staff and capability, and/or (c)\nduly hired consultants, if needed; (iv) the LGU should demonstrate availability of and willingness\nto contribute equity to finance the proposed subproject; and (v) the LGU should have no past\ndue obligation with LBP or other creditors, and no adverse credit background per investigation\nconducted by LBP.\nB. Component Eligibility and Selection Criteria\n4. The following components or a combination of them are eligible for financing under the\nproposed  credit  facility:  (i)  revenue-generating  infrastructure  components:  municipal  water\nsupply  system,  public  market  improvement,  bus  and  jeepney  transport  terminals,\nslaughterhouses or other public facilities, maintenance and operating equipment (related to\nabove components); and (ii) nonrevenue-generating infrastructure components: sanitation and\nsewer system, local roads and bridges, traffic management and engineering, flood control and\ndrainage, other environmental infrastructure projects, solid waste management, open space and\npublic memorial parks, seashore protection, maintenance and operating equipment (related to\nabove components).\n5. The  proposed  components  under  each  LGU  must  use  appropriate  technology  and\nrepresent the least-cost solution. To be in accord with the Government\u2019s development plans and\nfocus, identified components should (i) be endorsed by appropriate representatives of the LGU\nand by community approval through a consultation process; (ii) aim at providing, upgrading,\nmaintaining or operating basic urban infrastructure that will contribute to either the social or\neconomic  development  of  the  LGU  concerned;  (iii)  be  in  accordance  with  all  appropriate", "55 Appendix 10, page 2\ngovernment laws, standards, and procedures; (iv) be well-focused, demand-responsive, cost-\nefficient, and technically well-prepared and justified; (v) be devoid of major or significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts; and (vi) be within the financial capacity of the subborrower in terms of\nan equity contribution and the ability to serve the resultant debt. Finally, the LGUs will have\ntaken all necessary steps to acquire the required land, rights to land and water (for water supply\ncomponent),  and  rights-of-way  to  expeditiously  implement  the  component,  and  will  have\nobtained all required permits.\nC. Appraisal Criteria\n6. A structured approach will be adopted for the appraisal and approval of subprojects\nunder part A. Of the estimated 108 eligible subproject LGUs, 40 percent participation has been\nassumed. About 30 percent of subprojects (costing less than $0.5 million) have been classified\nas small, 60 percent (costing $0.5 million-$2.5 million) as medium-size, and 10 percent (costing\nover $2.5 million) as large. The size and scope of each subproject will be determined by the\ndemonstrated needs of and affordability to the project town, taking into account the institutional,\nfinancial, and operational capabilities of the LGU concerned. For all components, upgrading of\nexisting facilities and strengthening of their service capability will be first priority before the\nsystems are expanded. Technical design standards will be appraised, taking into account the\noverall  strategy  to  apply  appropriate  and  affordable  technology  and  to  provide  adequate\nflexibility for the wide variety of geographic and physical conditions in the project area. To meet\nprudent  technical  and  relending  criteria,  the  appraisal  will  further  consider  the  following\nparameters:\n(i)  Technical viability. The technical design must follow sound engineering practices\nas well as national Government guidelines; a cost-effective solution should be\nconsidered in comparing technical options.\n(ii)  Financial and economic analyses are required if a subproject is either medium-\nsize  or  large.  Financial  analyses  will  be  conducted  only  if  the  proposed\ncomponent is a revenue-generating one. Economic analysis will be undertaken\nfor both revenue- and nonrevenue-generating components.\n(iii)  Environmental acceptability. Environmentally sensitive areas will be avoided, if\npossible.  The  LGUs  concerned  should  provide  evidence  of  environmental\ncompliance  by  obtaining  an  environmental  compliance  certificate  from  the\nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources.  Compliance  with\nGovernment guidelines and requirements acceptable to ADB must be ensured.\n(iv)  Social  impact  analysis.  Components  should  meet  the  people\u2019s  needs  and\ndemands, and be responsive to the poverty reduction partnership agreed upon\nby  the  Government  and  ADB.  Criteria  for  assessment  should  include\nappropriateness  of  community  participation  and  consultation  processes,\naffordability,  willingness  to  pay,  stakeholder  analysis,  socioeconomic\ndistributional effect, number of poor beneficiaries, and gender issues.\n(v)  Financial capacity assessment. The local government\u2019s financial capacity will be\nassessed. Ability to borrow will be determined and availability of local counterpart\nfund assured.\n(vi)  Institutional capability. LGUs capacity to prepare, implement, and manage the\nsubproject must be assessed based on its capability to manage its existing urban\ninfrastructure and services.\n(vii)  Risk analysis. Subproject risks should be identified\u2014including permit and land\nacquisition requirements \u2014 and addressed at appraisal to minimize risks.", "56 Appendix 10, page 3\n(viii)  Benefit monitoring and evaluation. The subproject must include provisions for\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation to ensure that objectives are achieved.\nD. Selection and Approval Procedures\n7. Both  DILG  and  LBP  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  promoting  and  marketing  the\navailability  of  an  LGU  credit  facility  in  Mindanao  under  the  Project.  An  LGU  interested  in\nparticipating will submit initial applications to either the project development office (PDO) of\nDILG or Program Management Department (PMD) of LBP, including (i) a letter of interest briefly\nsummarizing the objectives and scope of the proposed subproject; (ii) a copy of the local\ndevelopment plan; and the (iii) LGU\u2019s financial condition at present and in the last three years.\n8. The Technical Review and Coordinating Committee (TRCC) will review the applications\nand  initially  assess  the  subprojects  considering  (i)  consistency  with  the  approved  local\ndevelopment plan and regional physical framework plan; (ii) LGU credit rating in accordance\nwith LBP\u2019s criteria; (iii) LGU financial capacity to repay the subloan and availability of equity fund\nto start up the proposed subproject; and (iv) institutional capability of the LGU to prepare,\nimplement, and manage the subproject. TRCC will endorse and inform the LGU concerned\nwhether the proposed subproject is eligible for further processing. A full feasibility study should\nbe prepared for the medium-size and large subprojects, and a short feasibility study for small\nsubprojects.\n9. Once endorsed by TRCC, the LGU concerned will prepare a full feasibility study of the\nproposed subproject, assisted by the subproject preparation and implementation support (SPIS)\nteam of PDO. PDO, in coordination with regional offices of DILG and LBP\u2019s lending centers, will\nsupport this preparation, and any subsequent modification, clarification, and processing of the\nsubloan applications to PMD in a timely manner. PMD may also accept a  feasibility study\nalready prepared by the LGU by informing PDO. The document should include (i) technical\nevaluation  of  each  component  proposed  in  a  subproject,  (ii)  evaluation  of  the  institutional\ncapacity  of  the  subborrower;  (iii)  a  socioeconomic  assessment  and  a  demand  survey  as\nappropriate  including  economic  analysis  of  nonrevenue-generating  components;  (iv)\nenvironmental examinations for environmentally sensitive components; (v) financial analysis,\nincluding  cash  flow  projection  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  revenue-generating\ncomponents; and (vi) financial projections demonstrating the entity\u2019s capacity to repay the loan.\n10. PMD  assisted  by  SPIS,  as  needed,  will  appraise  the  feasibility  study  and  make  a\nsubproject appraisal report (SPAR) for each LGU subproject (may include more than one\ncomponent in a SPAR). For medium-size and large subprojects, PMD will provide properly\nqualified experts to prepare full SPARs. Based on the official SPARs, PMD will recommend that\nTRCC approve or reject the subproject. Subproject (and components therein) selection and\napproval will be based on (i) sound technical solution with least-cost approach, (ii) financial and\neconomic viabilities, and (iii) LGU\u2019s financial capacity. The financial return must be greater than\nthe rate of the weighted average cost of capital. If user charges are associated with such\nsubcomponents, the users\u2019 willingness to pay for the services should exceed the charges\nnecessary for full cost recovery unless the LGU concerned will provide subsidized services in\naccordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) criteria for subsidies. The economic\nreturn from investment in nonrevenue-generating subcomponents should exceed the economic\nopportunity costs. All SPARs will be subject to review by LBP\u2019s loan approving group. The\ndetails of the appraisal procedure, participants, and discussions of the appraisal team will be\ndocumented in semiannual progress reports. TRCC will review and assess the technical and\neconomic soundness of the subproject, and may endorse the subproject on condition that LGU\nwill commit to undertake a performance management and monitoring indicator strengthening", "57 Appendix 10, page 4\nprogram. Upon TRCC\u2019s approval of the subproject, DILG will execute a subproject agreement\nand  LBP  will  execute  a  subloan  agreement  with  a  prospective  borrower.  The  subproject\nagreement  will  contain  the  objective,  scope,  implementation  arrangements  and  schedule,\ntentative procurement package, and the costs. The subloan agreement will contain the terms of\nfinancing the subproject, with the DILG letter of grant financing conditions and the subproject\nagreement as attachments.\n11. Before  forwarding  the  SPAR  to  LBP\u2019s  loan  approving  group,  PMD  will  seek  ADB\napproval if a subproject costs more than $2.5 million. If a subcomponent is regulated by DENR\nAdministrative Order  96-37, the concerned LGU should obtain an environmental clearance\ncertificate before disbursement is permitted. Even if a large subproject (para. 6) is not regulated\nAdministrative Order by 96-37, ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements will be followed.\nThe project implementation unit (PIU) concerned will submit an initial environment examination\nof the subproject to ADB for review before disbursement is made. For subprojects with identified\nadverse environmental impacts, ADB may request that an environmental impact assessment\nbe  prepared  and  reviewed  before  disbursement.  Documentation  relating  to  the  subproject\nappraisals and relevant supporting documents of the LGU concerned will be retained by PMD\n(with copy to PDO) and made available to ADB on request. ADB will review a selected number\nof these subprojects on ex post facto basis.\nE. Project Monitoring\n12. PDO will regularly monitor the physical and technical implementation, and institutional\ndevelopment  of  subprojects.  PMD  will  monitor  financial  progress  and  the  position  of  the\nsubborrower. The subborrower will submit a quarterly progress briefing letter to lending centers\nof LBP and PDO, from which PMD of LBP will compile a semiannual progress report on\nfinancial aspects and PDO will prepare semiannual progress reports on overall project progress.\nPDO will integrate and submit a consolidated semiannual progress report for ADB\u2019s review.\nEach subborrower will prepare and submit a subproject completion report  three months after\nphysical implementation is completed. Through the assistance of PMD and PDO, the PIU of\neach  LGU  will  establish  benefit  and  monitoring  indicators  in  six  months  after  signing  the\nsubproject agreement. Monitoring will be through the subproject progress briefing letters, and\nsubproject  completion  reports  will  include  benefit  and  monitoring  results.  A  copy  of  the\nsubproject completion report will be submitted to ADB. A project completion report for the whole\nproject will be prepared by PDO in collaboration with PMD. A draft project completion report will\nbe submitted to ADB for comments five months after physical completion, and will be completed\none month after receiving ADB\u2019s comments.", "58 Appendix 11\nINDICATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGES\nPackages (no.)

Scope of Resettlement Plan\n1. A resettlement plan was prepared for a foreshore development component in Dipolog\ncity to provide a guiding strategy and principles in preparing resettlement under the proposed\nsector project. The resettlement plan will be disclosed six months before project implementation\nto give the affected parties sufficient time to review and approve the plan. The component\nproposed by Dipolog requires land acquisition necessary to improve the foreshore bounded by\nTomas Claudio Street and Rizal Avenue. Specific improvements will include (i) a concrete\nroadway with provision for parking, (ii) development of small parks, (iii) repair of the existing\nseawall, and (iv) improvement of the wave deflector. The component will affect about 127\nfamilies (635 persons), with a small portion of private land belonging to one family.  Dipolog has\ndisclosed the resettlement plan since August 2000, through extensive public consultations with\naffected persons and by submitting the document to the City Planning Development Office for\npublic disclosure.\nB.     Socioeconomic Information\n2. The informal dwellers comprise mostly young persons: 22 percent below age 10 and 46\npercent below 25 years.  The female population is slightly higher by 7 percent than the male.\nNinety-nine percent of the residents are living on public land.  Only 1 percent own a private lot.\nAll the families own the housing structures; 69 percent are sole occupants while 31 percent\nhave one or two household sharers. The length of stay in the present area indicates a level of\nstability: 47 percent have lived in the area for over 30 years, and 53 percent have lived there for\nover 10 years but less than 30 years. The reasons for staying in the area are proximity and\naccess to basic services. Housing conditions are poor. About 84 percent of the houses are of\nlight materials, and 16 percent are semiconcrete structures. There is very little investment in\nhousing structures due to lack of security of tenure and low level of income.\n3. Average household expenditures are less than the household income by about P700,\nwhich suggests a little amount for savings. The average household income is P4,500/month,\nwhile average monthly expenditure is P3,800. The major expenditure is on food (53 percent),\nfollowed by school needs (13 percent). Of the total households surveyed, over 40 percent live\nbelow the poverty line (urban poverty threshold per capita is estimated as P12,336 in 1999 for\nRegion IX).\nC.  Principles of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan\n4. The Project will be governed in accordance with the established policies set by the Asian\nDevelopment Bank  (ADB), the Implementing Rules and Regulations mandated by the 1992\nUrban  Development  and  Housing  Act,  and  other  local  laws.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement  states:  (i)  avoid  involuntary  resettlement,  where  feasible;  and  (ii)  minimize\nresettlement where population displacement is unavoidable.  The overall guiding principle is to\nensure that resettlement will put the affected persons in a situation at least equal to or better\nthan where they were before the subproject component is implemented. Various national and", "60 Appendix 12, page 2\nlocal  policies  exist  to  strengthen  and  support  local  urban  development  initiatives  and\nresettlement. The 1987 Philippine Constitution states: \u201cUrban or rural poor dwellers shall not be\nevicted nor their dwelling demolished, except in accordance with law and in just and humane\nmanner.\u201d  The law further states: \u201cNo resettlement of urban dwellers shall be undertaken without\nadequate consultation with them and the communities where they are to be relocated.\u201d  The\nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Urban  Housing  and  Development  Act  of  1992\nestablish directives to ensure the observance of proper and humane relocation and resettlement\nprocedures.  This law determines procedures to be observed in the execution of eviction and\ndemolition orders involving underprivileged and homeless citizens, and provides guidelines on\nrelocation that the LGUs must strictly observe.\nD. Entitlements\n5. The  results  of  the  census  and  tagging  conducted  by  the  City  Social  Welfare\nDevelopment Office will be the basis for defining the eligibility of beneficiaries. There are two\ncategories of losses: (i) loss of housing structures, and (ii) temporary loss of incomes during\ntransfer and reconstruction.  For loss of housing structures, transportation assistance to the\nresettlement  site  for  salvaged  housing  materials,  along  with  new  housing  materials  worth\nP3,500, will be provided. For temporary loss of incomes, a short-term employment scheme\nrelated to demolition and relocation will be implemented such as absorbing one of the family\nmembers in the construction work, and providing food for work in house construction.   Persons\nwill be hired for 10 days and will be paid the minimum wage (P198.00 per day).  This strategy\nwill enable affected households to have an income in the interim.  While cash compensation is\nnot encouraged, nevertheless it will be given to affected parties on public land who choose not\nto be resettled, but opt to settle someplace else.  Such compensation will be considered as a\ndisturbance fee equivalent to P10,000, depending on the size and quality of the structure. A\ndisturbance fee will also be given to a renter as equivalent to loss of money on advanced rent.\nOnly one household owns titled land, a small portion of which and a part of the structure will be\nsliced.  Cash compensation will be based on the cost of replacing the portion of land and\nstructure at current market values.\nE. Participation and Grievance Mechanism\n6. Participation among stakeholders will be given much importance in the resettlement\nplan. To ensure that stakeholders take part in meaningful activities and participate in a decision\nthat will affect the direction of their lives, a community-based group will be organized to channel\ninformation, grievances, and resources. These will be through regular meetings and dialogues\nwith  the  affected  persons,  government,  nongovernment  organization  (NGO),  and  the  host\ncommunities, facilitated by the City Social Welfare Office and the NGO partner. The local\ncommittee on grievance will handle the process to redress grievance.\nF. Institutional Framework\n7. The institutional arrangement for the resettlement program activities is as follows: (i) the\nCity Planning Development Office will be the overall coordinating office in the resettlement\nprogram; (ii) the City Social Welfare Development Office will assign two social workers who will\nbe responsible for managing the Social Development Service Unit in the office; (iii) the City\nLegal Office will be responsible for land negotiation, arbitration and/or filing proceedings for", "61 Appendix 12, page 3\nexpropriation;  this office will also chair the action on grievances of affected persons; (iv) city\nassessors and the city budget officer will be responsible for land appraisal based on the existing\nlaw on just and fair compensation, and payment of landowners for land acquired for the right-of-\nway and resettlement area; and (v) the City Planning Development Office will be responsible for\nsite development, demolition, and provision of transportation facilities for relocation and transfer.\nThe PIU of the concerned  LGU will coordinate the subproject component activities.\nG. Finance and Implementation Schedule\n8. The  preliminary  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  the  resettlement  plan  is  estimated  at\nP6,914,585.  This includes land development (road network, electricity, water, and drainage),\ncost of relocation and transfer, compensation, livelihood, contingency, cost of land, census and\nsocioeconomic  survey,  resettlement  design,  construction,  and  supervision.  Social  welfare\nservices representing 41 percent of the total resettlement cost will be the counterpart share of\nthe LGU.  The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included in the project cost estimates.\nThe resettlement program will be implemented within two years.  The social preparation stage\nwill start upon confirmation of ADB\u2019s approval of the subproject component.\nH. Monitoring and Evaluation\n9. There will be two types of monitoring and evaluation activities. Internal monitoring will be\nconducted  jointly  by  the  PIU  of  the  concerned  LGU  and  the  community  beneficiaries.    A\nmonitoring team composed of staffs from PIU, City Planning Development Office, City Social\nWelfare  Development  Office  and  the  representative  beneficiaries  of  the  community  will\ncompose the community-based monitoring committee.  They will be responsible for monitoring\nand evaluating the resettlement once a year thereafter, for a period of three years.  An NGO will\nbe commissioned to conduct postevaluation of the resettlement program to assess whether the\nresettlement objectives have been achieved and to verify the results of internal monitoring.", "62 Appendix 13, page 1\nLAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES\nA. Overview\n1. Established by Republic Act 3844 on 8 August 1963, the Land Bank of the Philippines\n(LBP) is a government-owned financial institution and is the Executing Agency for the local\ngovernment unit (LGU) lending facility. LBP\u2019s original mandate was to provide financial support\nto the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, as well as to provide farmers with financial\nsupport to sustain their productivity. To support such activities, the bank engages in commercial\nbanking operations. A universal bank whose authorized capital has been raised from P9 billion\nto P25 billion, LBP has a policy mission and a developmental orientation since it also engages\nin special lending programs such as lending to LGUs. The bank is exempt from government\nregulations on compensation, position classification, and qualification standards.\n2. LBP is managed by a board of nine directors, comprising the following: the Secretary of\nFinance (chair), president of LBP (vice-chair), secretaries of agrarian reform, agriculture and\nlabor, and four other members appointed by the President of the Philippines to represent the\nagrarian reform beneficiaries, the landowners, and the private sector. Under the office of the\nLBP President and corporate executive office, there are four major sectors namely; Corporate\nServices and Subsidiaries Sector, Operations Sector, Institutional Banking Sector, and Agrarian\nand Domestic Banking Sector. The LBP President is assisted by 3 executive vice-president, 6\nsenior  vice  president,  14  first  vice-presidents,  26  vice-presidents,  and  55  assistant  vice-\npresidents. LBP manpower head count has been streamlined from a high 8,945 in end-1999 to\n8,466 in May 2001.\n3. The loan portfolio quality of LBP reflects its policy mission to serve the financing needs\nof the agrarian and agriculture sectors. This mission resulted in the deterioration of LBP\u2019s loan\nportfolio in 1998 when the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon led to slower growth in the\nagriculture sector. In 1999, its portfolio registered a worse-than-average nonperforming loan\nfigure primarily as a result of the souring of a number of its big-ticket commercial loans, limited\nopportunities in its other lending sectors as a whole, and its exposure to the farmers and\nfisherfolk cooperatives. As of fiscal year-end (FYE) 1999, the bank had a past-due ratio of 16.4\npercent, higher than the industry average of 13.6 percent during the period. Broken down into\nits commercial and agrarian components, nonperforming loans for the period were 15.9 percent\nand 20.9 percent, respectively. Total provisions the bank set aside for its loans were equivalent\nto 64.1 percent of nonperforming loans for the commercial and 92.6 percent of nonperforming\nloans for the agrarian side.\n4. LBP\u2019s LGU lending activities have grown significantly over the years, reaching P7.5\nbillion  as  of  end-2000.  Projects  financed  include  the  construction  of  water  and  telephone\nsystems, bus terminals, and public markets. The following are the major factors LBP  considers\nin  the  evaluation  process:  financial  condition  of  the  LGUs,  the  income  class,  budget\nmanagement capabilities and level of training of LGU officials, the views of the Department of\nInterior  and  Local  Government  and  the  Department  of  Finance,  the  viability  of  projects\nundertaken by the LGUs, economic conditions in the LGU and surrounding regions, and  the\npolitical situation the LGUs face. LBP has a solid track record in LGU lending as reflected by\nthe very low past-due rate of only 0.2 percent.\n5. LBP\u2019s  2000  financial  statements  show  an  expansion  in  the  company\u2019s  banking\noperations despite its inability to obtain any cash infusion from the national Government. Its\ntotal asset base increased by 5.56 percent to P210 billion between FY1999 and FY2000. The", "63 Appendix 13, page 2\nbank\u2019s deposit base has been steadily growing as well, rising 7.0 percent to P152 billion in\nFY2000 and 14.87 percent to P142 billion in FY1999. The deposit profile of LBP showed that\nout of its total deposits, 67.42 percent were generated from government or government-related\ninstitutions while the remaining 32.58 percent were sourced from private depositors. The bank\naims to diversify its deposit base further by attracting more private deposits, to reduce its\ndependence  on  interest-sensitive  government  funds.  LBP\u2019s  net  loans,  on  the  other  hand,\nremained relatively steady at P105 billion while its loan-to-deposit ratio declined to 75 percent in\n2000 from 87 percent in 1998.\n6. Based on LBP\u2019s projections, the bank expected to earn approximately P1.50 billion in\n2001, rising gradually in the following years. The projected income performance is lower than\nthe level achieved prior to the Asian economic crisis, when the yearly net income exceeded P2\nbillion. A major reason for this is the need to continue to build up its provisions for probable loan\nlosses so as to protect its long-term viability and its creditors. Provisioning activities for the past\ntwo years have been significant (para. 9). As a result of the need to ensure its viability and\nprotect its creditors, and because of Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses that\nare charged to LBP\u2019s operations, its return on asset (ROA) (after the Comprehensive Agrarian\nReform  Program)  has  been  around  the  0.20  percent  level  in  2000.  These  net  income\nprojections,  however,  are  conservative  and  are  based  on  a  very  aggressive  provisioning\nposture. As the domestic economy has stabilized and is expected to improve in the coming\nyears, the amount of provisioning may be less (but still sufficient) than the amounts indicated in\nLBP\u2019s conservative projections. This will improve LBP\u2019s ROA after Comprehensive Agrarian\nReform Program expenses from 0.20 percent in 2000 to more than 0.70 percent in 2004. This is\nbased on a provisioning level of P2.40 billion\u2013P2.65 billion a year for 2001-2004, which is way\nabove the provisioning level (approximately P0.3 billion) that existed before the Asian economic\ncrisis. As of end-2000, LBP\u2019s capital adequacy ratio  based on Central Bank of the Philippines\nstandards stood at 10.6 percent. The detailed description and financial statements of LBP are in\nSupplementary Appendix G.\nB.  Action Plan\n1. Strengthening Asset Quality\n7. Due to the Asian economic crisis, the asset quality of the whole banking sector has\nsteadily deteriorated over the years. With a nonperforming loan ratio  of approximately 3.5\npercent (end-1996) for the sector just before the crisis occurred, the nonperforming loan ratio\nhas jumped to 17.8 percent as of June 2000 for the whole commercial banking sector. The\npressure on asset quality continues due to the combination of the struggling macroeconomic\nperformance of the Philippines and the lag effects of the crisis. It must be noted that the asset\nquality  of  LBP  lags  behind  that  of  its  peers,  partly  due  to  its  policy  mission:  its  lending\noperations include providing credit to agriculture and other specific sectors, areas that entail\nhigher risks. As of end-2000, the exposure to farmers and fisherfolk cooperatives accounted for\nover 10.0 percent of LBP\u2019s gross loan portfolio, while the small and medium-scale enterprises\naccounted for another 10.0 percent. The weakest sector, agrarian lending, has a high past-due\nrate of 21.3 percent as of end-June 2000. Consequently, LBP\u2019s nonperforming loan ratio as of\nJune 2000 stood at 18.1 percent, higher than the industry average of 14.7 percent. Significant\nasset quality pressure can threaten the viability of a bank in the absence of such provisions. To\nprotect its creditors, LBP agrees to (i) cover its past-due accounts of agrarian loans to at least\n95 percent of cumulative loan loss reserves to past-due loans; and  (ii) continue building up its\nprovisions for probable loan losses to achieve a minimum coverage (total provisions divided by", "64 Appendix 13, page 3\npast-due loans) of at least 50 percent of its total past-due loans; this is higher than the current\nindustry average of approximately 44 percent.\n2.  Increasing Capitalization\n8. A  major  aspect  of  LBP\u2019s  financial  position  is  its  level  of  capitalization.  Its  capital\nadequacy ratio (based on Central Bank of the Philippines standards) declined from 13.1 percent\nin 1997 to 12.1 percent in 1998 and to 10.1 percent as of end-2000. This can be traced to its\nlower profitability, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses charged to its banking\noperations, and the steady expansion of its risk assets, among others. Furthermore, the Social\nSecurity System redeemed P1.2 billion worth of preferred shares in 1999, thus reducing LBP\u2019s\nlevel of capitalization. Indeed, its capitalization level declined in absolute terms from P15.26\nbillion in 1998 to P14.2 billion as of end-1999 by Central Bank of the Philippines standards.\nLBP\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  improved  to  11.6  percent  as  of  April  2001.  The  level  of\ncapitalization, however, is an important factor since it acts as an ultimate buffer when asset\nquality problems impose notable pressure on the bank. LBP agreed to maintain its capital\nadequacy ratio based on Central Bank of the Philippines standards to at least 10 percent. In the\nnext two years, LBP\u2019s capital adequacy ratio is projected at 11.7 percent at end-2001 and 11.5\npercent at end-2002.\n3. Building Up Provisions to Enhance Repayment Capacity\n9. Repayment capacity is enhanced when provisions for probable loan losses are built up.\nThis prudent banking move, however, will reduce profitability. Regarding LBP\u2019s profitability, net\nincome in 1999 decreased by 37.5 percent as it declined to P627 million from approximately P1\nbillion in 1998. These income figures are below those of previous years due to LBP\u2019s heavy\nprovisioning for the past two years: P7.5 billion in 1999 and P4.8 billion in 1998. These are\nmuch higher than the P1.5 billion in 1997, P0.1 billion in 1996, P0.5 billion in 1995, and P0.2\nbillion in 1994. This aggressive provisioning posture on the part of LBP is  considered prudent,\nas the aftereffects of the Asian economic crisis are still seeping into the banking system. LBP\nplans to set aside provisions of approximately P2 billion or more to enhance its credit standing\nand loan repayment capacity. Because of the importance of provisioning, it is inevitable and\nwise to impose a more realistic profitability requirement. LBP\u2019s net income resulted in its ROA\nat the 0.20 percent level FY2000. These results, however, are conservative and are based on a\nvery aggressive provisioning posture. As the domestic economy has stabilized and is expected\nto improve in the coming years, provisioning may be less (but still sufficient) than the amounts\nindicated  in  LBP\u2019s  conservative  projections.  This  will  improve  LBP\u2019s  ROA  after  the\nComprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  expenses  from  year  2001  onward.  Thomsons'\nRatings Philippines projects that LBP can balance the required provisioning for probable loan\nloss and profitability without affecting its credit standing (Table A13). Therefore, LBP agrees to\nmeet the following targets: ROA (after Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses) of\n0.55 percent for 2001, and 0.6 percent for 2002 and subsequent years. These profitability\ntargets can be attained based on a P2.5 billion provisioning level each year for 2001-2004. This\nprovisioning level is still aggressive in nature and is way above the level that existed before the\nAsian economic crisis.\n4.  Maintaining Health and Improving Liquidity Position\n10. LBP\u2019s  loan-to-deposit  ratio  stood  at  75  percent  in  2000,  an  improvement  from  the\nprevious year\u2019s 87 percent in 1998 (82.75 percent in 1997 and 87.87 percent in 1996).   On the\nother hand, its quasi-liquid assets ratio stood at 38.31 percent as of end-1999, higher than", "65 Appendix 13, page 4\n1998\u2019s 33.35 percent, 1997\u2019s 35.01 percent, and 1996\u2019s 35.66 percent.  LBP agrees to improve\nliquidity position as follows: (i) loan-to-deposit ratio of not more than 90 percent; and (ii) a\nminimum quasi-liquid asset ratio of 25 percent (defined as cash on hand, checks and other\ncash items, marketable securities, and due from Central Bank of the Philippines and other\nbanks, divided by total assets). The loan-to-deposit ratio at 90 percent is considered reasonable\nas it will increase LBP\u2019s headroom to lend out such funds, and subsequently enhance its\nprofitability. As such funds are not part of the deposit base, they have the effect of increasing\nthe  loan-to-deposit  ratio.  Furthermore,  as  the  domestic  economy  improves,  lending\nopportunities increase, causing a positive impact on LBP\u2019s profitability.\nTable A13: Land Bank of the Philippines Projecteda Profit and Loss Scenario (Pmn)\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nRevenues\nLoans 10,620 11,085 12,543 15,624 16,755\nInvestments 6,398 9,207 8,599 8,931 10,096\nForeign Exchange 577 197 201 668 702\nOthers 1,691 1,010 1,036 1,982 2,081\n             Gross Revenues 19,286 21,499 22,379 27,205 29,634\nExpenses\nInterest on Deposits 6,199 6,445 6,607 10,008 11,009\nOther Financial Expenses 1,339 1,825 2,257 1,991 2,073\nTotal Cost of Funds 7,538 8,270 8,864 11,999 13,082\nProvision for Loan Losses 2,599 2,417 2,400 2,650 2,550\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses 6,552 9,138 9,343 8,721 9,593\n            Total Expenses 16,689 19,825 20,607 23,370 25,225\nNet Income Before CARP 2,597 3,835 4,409\nCARP Expenses Charged to Banking 1,832 1,380 1,349\nNet Income Before Provision for Income Tax 765 1,674 1,772 2,455 3,060\nProvision for Income Tax 265 174 195 737 918\nNet Income 500 1,500 1,577 1,718 2,142\nCARP = Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.\na\n LBP provided projections for 2001 and 2002 as of 18 January 2001, while Thomson Ratings Philippines provided\nthose for 2003 and 2004.\n5.  LBP\u2019s LGU Lending\n11. In view of the preference for granting heavy equipment loans to LGUs in Mindanao, LBP\nwill (i) duly comply with the sublending eligibility criteria set forth under the Project, and (ii)\nensure that its field staff receive on-the-job training for capacity-building in part B of the Project.\nC.  Implication of Mindanao Basic Urban Services Facility\n12. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) loan to LBP would have negligible impact on\nLBP\u2019s profit/loss and net income statements, since the ADB loan accounts for less than 1\npercent of LBP\u2019s total resources annually. However, LBP is slowly addressing the mismatch in\nfunding by trying to attract more long-term deposits. The ADB loan will largely be beneficial in\naddressing this asset liability mismatch by attracting long-term maturing deposits, rather than by\nimpacting on net income. From an asset-liability perspective, access to long-term funds from\nforeign and domestic agencies allows the bank to allocate up to 35 percent of its loans for long-\nterm purposes. The presence of these funds helps in addressing the mismatch in the bank\u2019s\nfunding structure where 89 percent of its deposits were short-term and only 11 percent had\nlong-term maturities as of FY2000.", "66 Appendix 14, page 1\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\nA. General\n1. The  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  five  components1  were  guided  by  the\nfollowing Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines: (i) Framework for the Economic and\nFinancial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects, (ii) Guidelines for the Economic\nAnalysis of Projects, (iii) Guidelines for Preparation and Presentation of Financial Analysis of\nProjects,  and  (iv)  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects.  All\nsubprojects are subject to analysis of subborrower\u2019s financial capacity. Medium-size or large\nsubprojects should provide financial and economic analyses of proposed components in a\nsubproject. Economic internal rates of returns (EIRRs) are calculated for all components, and\nfinancial internal rates of returns (FIRRs) are calculated for revenue-generating components.\nB. Economic Analysis\n2. The economic life of the infrastructure components is assumed to be 20 years, except\nthat for solid waste management, which is assumed to be 7 years.  After this period, residual\nvalue is considered to be nil. Economic evaluation used the domestic price numeraire because\nproject inputs are mainly nontradable.  For valuation of tradable goods, a shadow exchange rate\nfactor of 1.22 was used based on the standard conversion factor of 0.837. A shadow wage rate\nfactor of 0.7 was applied to the wage of unskilled labor at the domestic price level.\n1.   Parang Water Supply\n \n3. The economic benefits of the water supply components relate mainly to  (i) an unmet\ndemand  for  piped  water  supply  services  in  the  municipality,  and  (ii)  incremental  water\nconsumption by new water users.  The municipality will receive substantial benefits from lower\nwater costs as many people living in the subproject area depend on expensive water sold by\nprivate water vendors and/or their own deep or shallow wells, which are often unhygienic. The\nbenefit streams include (i) nonincremental economic benefits obtained by switching from private\nvendor supplies to the public water systems, and valued at the quantity of water consumed prior\nto connection to the public water supply system multiplied by the economic supply price, and (ii)\nincremental economic benefits estimated by multiplying incremental water consumption with the\naverage demand price. Consumption was based on a linear demand curve. Cost savings result\nfrom not having to buy water from private water vendors. Recurrent costs include the cost of\npower, system operation and maintenance, and chemical expenditures for water treatment.\nOnly  incremental  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  Project  are  included.  The  proposed\nimprovement of the water supply system is further expected to reduce the unaccounted-for\nwater to at least 25 percent.  However, there are no estimates of how much unaccounted-for\nwater is technical (leakage) or nontechnical (water consumed but not paid for).\n2.   Dipolog Bypass Road\n4. The proposed bypass road aims to (i) ease traffic congestion along the present national\nhighway,  (ii) get vehicles out of the central business district, and (iii) provide an alternative route\nto motorists and other road users who want to avoid the central business district of Dipolog. The\nexisting route is 3.4 kilometers (km) long, while the proposed route would be 2.5 km.  The new\nroad will save some 10 minutes of travel time at busy periods. For the bypass road component,\nvehicle operating cost savings, including reduced maintenance costs and savings in travel time\n                                                          \n1\n  The  Bus Terminal and Solid Waste Projects in Kidapawan City, the Foreshore Development and the Bypass Road Projects in\nDipolog City and the Water Supply Project in Parang municipality.", "67 Appendix 14, page 2\nfor passengers and goods, were considered for direct and potential road users.  Total benefits\nwere calculated based on the traffic count surveys conducted for the purpose. Using 4.5 percent\ntraffic growth rate, the diverted traffic was projected for the whole planning period.  For the with-\nproject case, vehicle operating cost estimates were based on estimated diverted traffic via the\nproposed bypass road plus the vehicle operating cost of the remaining traffic at the old route.\nAnother benefit of the project is decongestion, but this was not quantified due to insufficient\ninformation  on  the  total  traffic  volume  in  the  central  urban  streets  to  model  the  impact  if\ncongestion is reduced.  The benefits of the bypass are therefore underestimated to some\ndegree. Maintenance cost was estimated on the basis of the equivalent maintenance kilometers\nmethod.  Routine maintenance for the project will cover drainage cleaning, vegetation control,\nrepainting  of  pavement  markings,  cleaning  of  road  accessories,  and  shoulder  repair  costs\ncomputed at P0.165 million annually.\n3. Dipolog Foreshore Development\n5. The economic benefits of the foreshore development component are largely expected\nfrom  the  following:  (i)  protecting  the  foreshore  area  from  sea  erosion,  (ii)  improving\nenvironmental sanitation in the area by relocating the squatters who are the main sources of\npollution, (iii) employment and economic opportunities with the development of the area for\nbusiness  and  commerce,  and  (iv)  improved  living  condition  of  the  affected  squatters  and\nemployment opportunities in the resettlement area.\n6. For calculating the EIRR, the relevant benefits are those that can be quantified in\nmonetary terms.  The measurable community benefits used in the economic analysis were the\nwillingness  of  potential  consumers  (stallholders  and  those  who  will  purchase  or  lease  the\ndevelopment site) to pay.  The high level of the EIRR of the proposed foreshore development in\nDipolog  is  due  mainly  to  the  relatively  low  opportunity  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  high\ndevelopment benefits. The economic benefits of this component will be maximized on account\nof the resettlement program currently being undertaken in the city.\n4. Kidapawan Solid Waste Management\n7. In compliance with the requirements of the Department of Environment and Natural\nResources (DENR), controlled dumping is proposed for Kidapawan.  Controlled dumping is the\nintermediate stage in upgrading disposal from open dumping to sanitary landfill.  It comprises a\nminimal-engineered disposal site with minimum prescribed site infrastructure and operational\nmeasures and facilities that will mitigate some of the adverse impacts brought about by open\ndumping.  Considerably less investment is required in capital works or equipment purchases\nthan for sanitary landfill. While city staff are locating a permanent site for the landfill, the\nproposal is considered the most cost-effective alternative. Intangible environmental and health\nbenefits of improved solid waste management were identified as the primary benefits associated\nwith  the  solid  waste  project.  However,  these  benefits  cannot  be  quantified  directly.  The\nmeasurable community benefits used in the economic analysis were taken to be the willingness\nof the community to pay. The social survey indicates a willingness to pay about P64 per month\nper family. The expressed willingness to pay is accepted here as the measure of benefits\nregardless of whether residents actually do or do not pay the amount.\n5.  Kidapawan Bus Terminal\n8. A new bus terminal is proposed to reduce traffic congestion and inconvenience at the\nexisting terminal. The new terminal will accommodate an estimated 200 buses per day and 38\nrentable stalls, with an expected annual traffic growth at about 4.6 percent per year. The primary", "68 Appendix 14, page 3\nbenefits of these improvements are estimated by the willingness of bus, jeepney operators, and\nstallholders to pay. Unquantifiable time savings benefits from reduced traffic are likely; thus, the\ntotal economic benefits are underestimated. Economic costs were estimated on the basis of the\nlonger distance to the site, as additional vehicle operating costs per bus (P7.09) and jeepney\n(P1.90 per km).\n6. Results\n9. The major indicators of the economic viability of the components are summarized in\nTable A14.1.  All components are economically viable, with base case EIRRs of 14-38 percent,\nexceeding the 12 percent economic opportunity cost of capital.\nC. Financial Analysis\n10. FIRRs and fund flow projections were prepared for the cost recovery components in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban\nDevelopment Sector Projects.  FIRRs were calculated for water supply, foreshore development,\nand the bus terminal.  Solid waste management in Kidapawan was not subjected to financial\nanalysis, mainly because the city officials expressed their intention of subsidizing the operation\nand not collecting garbage or tipping fees for the proposed controlled dump, as the service\nwould generate beneficial external effects, and subsidy could be justified in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Criteria for Subsidies. The expected revenue estimates are based on user charges.  The\nanalyses  were  conducted  in  2000  constant  prices  and  accounted  for  all  costs  incurred  in\nconstruction except price contingencies.  Incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs\nare included in the analyses.  The resulting FIRRs are compared with the calculated weighted\naverage cost of capital (WACC) for each component. WACC was based on the weighted\ninterest of borrowings, grant, and local equity.\n1.   Parang Water Supply\n \n11. To recover the costs of the facilities and services, the primary sources of revenue would\nbe monthly user tariffs and connection fee from new customers. The resulting charges in\nconstant 2000 prices were computed at P12 per cubic meter (m3) for domestic connection, P24\nper m3 for commercial connection, and P18 per m3 for institutional connection.  A connection fee\nof  P800  will  be  charged  to  all  those  who  will  connect  to  the  new  system.  The  potential\npopulation to be served was estimated to be about 20,313 with 120 liters per capita per day.\nO&M costs include expenditures for salaries, power, chemicals, spare parts, and miscellaneous\nexpenses. Only the incremental O&M costs were included in calculating the FIRR.  The design\nyear for the project was expected to be 2011. The WACC for the water supply project was\ncalculated to be 12.4 percent.  Computed net revenues and the FIRR for the base case\ncompared favorably with the WACC estimate.  However, conventional sensitivity tests show that\nthe FIRR is sensitive to significant adverse changes in costs and revenues.\n \n2. Dipolog Foreshore Development\n \n12. The area available for lease or sale for commercial development is estimated to be\n2,950 square meters (m2). City officials confirmed their intention of leasing half of the developed\narea and selling the remaining half to private developers.  Financial analysis focused on these\noptions.  The best estimate of P10,000 per m2 (at 2000 price level) was used as the expected\nsale value.  Commercial lots in the central business district currently sells at twice that value.  A\ntotal of P24.9 million is anticipated over three years, 2003-2005.  The potential lease revenue is\nbased on 7 percent of the sale value, estimated to be P2.065 million annually.  An additional\nsource of income would be 68 stalls to rented out for P20 per m2 per day, equivalent to P2.978", "69 Appendix 14, page 4\nmillion a year. For the project financial viability analysis, the FIRR, which is the discount rate\nthat equalizes the present values of costs and revenues over the project life, was calculated.\nThe base FIRR is 30.3 percent, which is above the assumed WACC of 12.4 percent.  The\nFIRRs, with associated sensitivity tests, are given in Table A14.1.\n \n3. Kidapawan Bus Terminal\n \n13. Currently, about 200 buses and 55 jeepneys use the existing terminal facility.  The same\nnumbers are expected to use the new terminal.  The approximate charge per vehicle that would\nresult in a fully self-funding operation would be P35 per bus and P17.50 per jeepney.  It is\nrecognized  that  the  proposed  charges  are  significantly  higher  than  the  current  charges.\nHowever, they are comparable with charges for newly constructed transport terminal facilities in\nother cities in Mindanao.  Another source of income for the terminal would be the 38 stalls that\nwould be rented out at P5.00 per m2 per day. Recurrent costs would be incurred for both\nwithout- and with-project cases.  Those costs are assumed to be the same for both cases and\nare therefore net to zero for the marginal cash flows.  The WACC for the terminal component\nwas calculated to be 11.8 percent.  The return on the marginal investment (FIRR) for the base\ncase marginally exceeds the estimated WACC. (Table A14.1).\n4. Results\n14. The major indicators of the financial viability of the components are summarized in Table\nA14.1.  All components are financially viable, with base case FIRRs of 13-30 percent exceeding\nthe computed WACC for each component.\nD. Tariff Structure and Affordability\n1. Parang Water Supply\n \n15. The poverty threshold income for Parang was estimated to be P76,734 per annum\n(P12,789 per capita).  An estimated 48 percent of households fall within this income group.  An\nannual tariff of P2,592 would represent 3.4 percent of that income.  This is less than 5 percent,\nwhich is assumed to be the acceptable maximum expenditure for water for the low-income\ngroup.  As per the social survey, current household expenditure for water from vendors and\nother sources averaged P2,500 per annum.  This amount is paid for only about 3.5 m3 of water\nper household per month.  It is unlikely that the slight increase in the proposed tariff would be an\nissue to the consumers, considering the improvement in both quality and quantity of water to be\nsupplied by the subproject.\n \n2. Dipolog Foreshore Development\n16. The results of the financial and economic analyses hinge on the price for which the\nproposed land development can be sold or leased.  The city administration confirmed the ability\nor willingness of potential buyers or lessors to pay the quoted price, and that demand would be\nmore than adequate based on current fair market price in the urban center.\n \n3. Kidapawan Bus Terminal\n17. For the Kidapawan bus terminal component, the proposed user charges will be raised\nsubstantially,  largely  due  to  the  gap  between  the  current  rental  fee  charged  by  the  city\ngovernment to the bus/jeepney operators and the proposed fee to ensure project viability.\nHowever,  the  city  will  ensure  that  full  cost  recovery  charges  do  not  exceed  the  level  of\nwillingness to pay elicited during the socioeconomic survey.", "70 Appendix 14, page 5\nE. Affordability to the Local Government\n18. The  financial  capabilities  of  the  Implementing  Agencies,  the  local  government  units\n(LGUs), were evaluated based on financial statements and forecasts of future revenues and\nexpenditures.  The internal revenue allotment (IRA) is a major source of revenues for LGUs,\nfollowed by locally generated revenues.  The annual average real growth rates for IRA and\nlocally generated revenues were 11 and 10 percent, respectively, over the last five years.  The\nannual growth rate used for revenue and expenditure projections in real prices are as follows:\n(i) an average 10 percent increase in IRA from 2001 to 2005 and 5 percent annual increase\nthereafter;  (ii) a 10 percent annual increase in local taxes;  (iii) a 5 percent annual increase in\nnontax  revenue;  and  (iv)  a  5-10  percent  annual  increase  in  expenditures.  Table  A14.2\nsummarizes  the  financial  projections  of  the  three  LGUs  (in  current  2000  prices).  Detailed\nrevenue  and  expenditure  statements  are  reported  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  A,  B,  C,\nrespectively, for each LGU.\n19. The cash flow projections indicate that all three LGUs have the capacity to borrow for the\nproposed investments. The Local Government Code requires the LGUs\u2019 annual debt service  to\nbe comfortably within the 20 percent limit, with the highest level at about 8 percent when\nprincipal repayments start to be due.  The projected financial statements from 2001 to 2015 also\nindicate that the financial condition of LGUs will improve over the medium term.\nTable A14.1: Summary of the Economic and Financial Analyses\nComponent EIRR FIRR\nPercent Sensitivity Switching Percent Sensitivity Switching\nIndicator    Value  Indicator   Value\nA.

Poverty Analysis\n1. The Asian financial crisis resulted in substantial government revenue shortfalls, which\nnecessitated cutbacks on its spending, particularly in the economic and services sectors, which\nfell by 33 percent in real terms from 1997 to 1998. This also meant cutbacks in the delivery of\nsocial services. The crisis also severely affected the local government unit (LGU) expenditures\non economic services and led LGUs to increases in unemployment and underemployment rates\nin 1998. Over one third of the labor force in Mindanao is unemployed or underemployed, and\nper capita income is only 75 percent of the national average.\n2. Social  indicators  are  also  low  in  the  project  area:  the  average  value  of  the  life\nexpectancy index for the Philippines is 0.72, and the lowest value in one of the provinces of the\nproject area is 0.47. The project area has higher than average infant mortality rate in the project\nregions and the worst in the Philippines. The human development index ranges between 0.491\nfor the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and 0.649 for Region 10, compared\nwith 0.740 for the Philippines as a whole.\n3. Among  the  island  groups,  Mindanao  remains  the  poorest,  with  the  highest  poverty\nincidence (head count) of 50 percent (Table A15). The 1997 incidence of poverty in Mindanao\u2019s\nurban area (37 percent) was nearly twice the national average for urban areas (21.5 percent).\nOf the total 7.4 million urban poor, about 2.1 million (28 percent) reside in urban Mindanao. The\nfigure was highest in the ARMM at 51 percent and lowest in Region 9 and 11 at 26 percent and\n27 percent, respectively. The survey for a project preparatory technical assistance  in three\nrepresentative pilot LGUs in Mindanao at end-1998 revealed an even higher urban poverty\nincidence averaging 50 percent.\nTable A15: Poverty Threshold and Poverty Incidence (1997)\nPoverty Urban Poverty Total Poverty Urban Urban Poor HDI\nThreshold Threshold (P per Incidence Poverty Population (based on\nRegion (P per capita per year) (head count Incidence (\u2018000) international\ncapita per in percent) (head count comparative\nyear) in percent) data)\nPhilippines 11,319 12,577 36 21 7,455 0.740\nMindanao 10,586 11,567 50 37 2,137 0.601\nRegion 9 9,732 11,299 46 26 250 0.603\nRegion 10 10,440 11,259 53 40 696 0.649\nRegion 11 10,503 11,704 44 27 631 0.629\nRegion 12 11,119 12,468 56 40 269 0.622\nARMM 11,134 12,603 63 51 287 0.491\nARMM = Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, HDI = human development index.\nSource: Technical Working Group on Income Statistics, National Statistical Coordination Board.

To  date,  the  current  Mindanao  conflict  has  caused  damage  to  lives  and  property,\ndisplaced hundreds, and used up funds that could have been channeled to essential services,\nespecially for the vulnerable and marginalized groups. Provision of basic social services was\nhampered and investor confidence fell. The urban poor have been driven by circumstances to\nbecome informal settlers and homeless, residing in danger zones such as riverbanks, foreshore,\nunder the bridges, beside the railways. A considerably higher proportion of households headed\nby women also characterizes the urban poor. Deficiencies in urban infrastructure and service\nlevels in Mindanao are significantly higher than the national average. The incidence of the use\nof drinking water from potentially polluted sources is 24 percent in urban Mindanao, but 12", "73 Appendix 15, page 2\npercent in the Philippines as a whole. Similarly, whereas almost 80 percent of households in the\nurban  Philippines  have  access  to  water-sealed  toilets,  only  60  percent  of  households  in\nMindanao  enjoy  such  facilities.  Lack  of  access  to  basic  services  and  infrastructure  has  a\nnegative impact on the productivity of urban economies and the already poor living conditions.\nB.  Social Impacts of the Project\n5. Employment and Income. A number of the subproject components will have a direct\nimpact  on  permanent  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities.  Improvements  to  the\npublic market area in Kidapawan, for example, will increase the market share from its catchment\narea and lead to increased income for the market stallholders. Temporary employment will also\nbe created during construction of the subproject components. While the local community at\nlarge will benefit from basic services improvements, a positive distributional effect to the urban\npoor is also expected to occur. For example, a large proportion of the employment created by\nthe Project will be in low-skills jobs, which can be done by the urban poor.\n6. Time Savings. Improved basic services can save communities much in terms of time.\nThe Dipolog bypass road, for example, will lead to travel time savings for vehicles diverted to\nthe road; it will also lead to reduced traffic congestion and consequent travel time savings for\npeople at the city center. The Parang water supply system will reduce time spent in carrying\nwater from outside sources to the home.\n7. Health Benefits. Much of the basic infrastructure to be provided through the Project is\ndirectly  or  indirectly  linked  to  health  benefits.  Water  supply  is  a  basic  necessity  and,  as\nillustrated in Parang, people are willing to pay a high premium for it. Improved water quality can\nprevent disease and illness, the benefits of which need not be measured solely in reduced cost\nof medicine and days lost from work but also in reduced human discomfort and stress. Similar\nhealth benefits are expected from improved sanitation and garbage disposal, since solid waste\ndisposal problems are often more acute in poorer areas. In projects such as improvements to\nwater supply, there may be greater health benefits to poor people as they would most likely use\nmore polluted sources of water without the proposed piped water supply system. Moreover, they\nwould probably have to travel shorter distances to obtain water. It is often the case that in terms\nof felt needs, communities are unable to make the connection between lack of basic services\nand health levels.\n8. Gender Impact. There is often a positive gender distributional effect. In the case of\nwater supply projects, women and female children are often responsible for carrying water to\ntheir homes. Transportation projects, which improve movement around an urban area, can\nbenefit women who are often responsible for food shopping, delivering goods to markets, and\naccessing health care facilities and schools. Public market projects can often bring a positive\ngender distributional effect, since female heads of households frequently earn income as petty\ntraders in the public market. Better services with expansion of the public market area will have a\npositive gender impact.\n9. Peace  and  Order.  Mindanao  remains  one  of  the  poorest  areas  in  the  Philippines.\nPoverty  often  contributes  to  a  situation  of  social  unrest  and  disorder,  as  people  become\ndissatisfied  with  their  socioeconomic  conditions  and  their  inability  to  influence  change.\nImproving the social and economic situation of urban areas will contribute to a feeling of human\nwell-being and will promote peace and order.\nC.  Demand and Willingness to Pay for Improved Infrastructure\n10. The assessment for each subsector indicated that the need for an improved system was\nmatched by a willingness to pay. The majority of beneficiaries would only be willing to pay a\nprice similar to their current water bill, or a small proportion (10 percent) would be willing to pay", "74 Appendix 15, page 3\nat the most up to 20 percent more than their current water bill. The survey from the core pilot\nLGUs also revealed a very high preference (81 percent) for improved sanitation services.\nWillingness to pay for sanitation services is correspondingly high. Responses varied with regard\nto patterns of solid waste collection in the pilot areas. In Parang, where there is low satisfaction\nwith current waste collection, there is a high willingness to pay. In Kidapawan, on the other\nhand, low satisfaction is not matched by a high willingness to pay. In Dipolog, the majority of the\nsurveyed population is satisfied with links to the provinces, Mindanao, and the rest of the\nPhilippines. The survey asked people to identify public buildings and facilities that they would\nconsider priority areas for improvement. In the entire pilot LGUs, improvement to the public\nmarket is the main area of concern. Other significant choices for improvement are the intercity\nbus terminal, main bus terminal, sea transport terminal, and sports center.\nD. Participation of Community and Nongovernment Organizations\n11. Subproject  components  are  identified  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and\nseminars  with  extensive  stakeholder  participation.  The  LGU  decision  on  the  selection  and\nprioritization of components was also carried out in a participatory manner, involving relevant\nstakeholders, particularly the poor, women, and local civic organizations. A community-based\nparticipatory approach to project planning and implementation, which is built on community\npriority needs, will in general both maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts.\nE.  Urban Services for the Poor\n12. As  over  40  percent  of  poverty  incidence  is  common  and  wide  spread  in  LGUs  in\nMindanao, most subproject interventions will serve the urban poor substantially in both direct\nand indirect ways. The proposed Project includes direct intervention and indirect incentive\nmechanisms  to  provide  urban  services  for  the  poor,  such  as  (i)  direct  participation  and\nrepresentation  of  the  poor  in  a  community  participatory  planning  approach  for  prioritizing\ninvestment needs; (ii) up to 25 percent of grant financing for subproject components such as\nsanitation, drainage, and flood protection measures, from which the poor living in flood-prone\nareas would benefit significantly; and (iii) priority to the poor in hiring laborers in construction\nactivities. Other components will indirectly benefit the poor. Improving LGU-wide infrastructure\nservices and the urban environment will enhance the general well-being and the quality of life\nfor poor communities.\nF. Potential Beneficiaries and Poverty Impact\n13. The  economic  impact  of  the  Project  has  been  identified  as  more  employment\nopportunities and improved quality of living standards. The impact of the Project on poverty will\nvary with the individual components proposed and executed by LGUs. Most of the subproject\ncomponents will directly benefit the primary beneficiaries and indirectly benefit the entire urban\npopulation of the LGU concerned.\n14. The total population of the urban areas in the 108 LGUs eligible to participate in the\nProject is estimated to be about 5 million. The total number of potential beneficiaries would be\nabout 2 million people, projecting about 40 percent LGUs participating in the Project. However,\nnot all of the 2 million would benefit to the same extent. The coverage of the project impact very\nmuch depends on individual components selected according to demand, as the Project adopted\na sector approach. Since urban infrastructure and services are for public use (except water\nsupply charging fees for private connection), people from the peri-urban areas as well as the\nresidents of the participating LGUs would benefit. Among them, more than one third (or 0.8\nmillion) of the beneficiaries are expected to be urban poor.\n15. Based on the infrastructure demand revealed by the indicative 13 LGUs, it is estimated\nthat the distribution of infrastructure investment would be (i) about 27 percent for public markets", "75 Appendix 15, page 4\nand bus terminals, (ii) about 23 percent for roads and bridges, (iii) 14 percent for improvement\nof solid waste management, (iv) 6 percent for flood protection and sanitation, (v) 12 percent for\nwater supply, and (vi) about 18 percent for other public facilities.  Based on the analysis of three\ncore pilot subprojects, the needs to hire low-skill laborers for construction activities will be\nalmost 20 percent of all civil works. It is estimated that the Project will generate over 100,000\nperson-months of employment opportunities for the poor. Taking into account the distribution of\nphysical investment across subsectors, it is estimated that the Project will provide (i) better bus\nterminals and public market facilities for over 220,000 poor people, (ii) improved roads and\naccessibility for at least 190,000 poor people; (iii) improved solid waste collection for about\n110,000 urban poor, (iv) flood protection and improved sanitation facilities for about 50,000\npoor, (v) affordable water systems for 100,000 poor people, and (v) other public facilities to raise\nthe living standards of 140,000 poor."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010910164825Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R143-01rrp.doc", "ModDate": "D:20040211113206+08'00'"}}
