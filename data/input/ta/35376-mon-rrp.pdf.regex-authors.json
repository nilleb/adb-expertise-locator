The project is unlikely to have adverse environmental \nAssessment  impacts. \n   \nProject Description  The  Customs  Modernization  Project  aims  to  finance  (i)  the \n  migration  and  upgrading  of  the  customs  automated  data \n  processing  system  (GAMAS);  (ii)  the  improvement  of \n  infrastructure at major customs houses and customs border posts; \n  and (iii) institutional strengthening, including business process re-\n  engineering,  capacity  building  in  relation  to  the  above  two \ncomponents, interagency coordination, regional cooperation, and \npublic\u2013private partnerships. \n   \nRationale  The Project reflects the Government\u2019s efforts to promote trade \nand improve the investment climate through customs reforms and \nmodernization.  It  is  a  response  to  (i)  the  recent  accession  of \nMongolia to the International Convention on the Simplification and \nHarmonization  of  Customs  Procedures  (Revised  Kyoto \nConvention) and the forthcoming enactment of a new Customs \nLaw, (ii) the Government\u2019s recent move toward a national single \nelectronic  window  (SEW)  service  and  e-government,  and \n(iii) Mongolia's attempt to gear up the fight against corruption.  \n \nThe GAMAS needs upgrading to enable it to meet the increasing \ndemands of customs administration. The GAMAS is still manually \noperated and labor-intensive and has a decentralized architecture. \nThe existing capacity of the GAMAS server and network system is \nlow and the system can no longer cope with the growing number \nof  customs  declarations  or  maintain  proper  trade  statistics. \nModern customs business processes such as risk management \nand  post-clearance  audits  cannot  be  effectively  or  widely \nintroduced because of the lack of an internet-enabled system and \na centralized database. \n ", "ii \n  Customs  inspection  equipment  and  anti-smuggling  detection \nfacilities are inadequate in most customs border posts. The only \ncustoms  laboratory  is  in  the  headquarters  of  the  Mongolian \nCustoms General Administration (MCGA) in Ulaanbaatar, to which \nsamples of goods have to be transported for examination. These \nconstraints constitute bottlenecks to trade.  \n \nIn concert with the new anti-corruption legislation, the issue of \ngovernance  needs  to  be  addressed  by  improving  business \nprocesses  and  providing  MCGA  with  modern  techniques  and \ntools. Training and capacity building, partnerships with the private \nsector,  and  cooperation  with  other  border  agencies  and  with \nneighboring customs administrations are needed. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project aims to increase the volume and facilitate the smooth \nflow  of  Mongolia\u2019s  external  trade.  This  will  be  achieved  by \nimproving efficiency, transparency, and sustainability in customs \nservices and administration. The Project will lower the incidence \nof  corruption  and  smuggling,  enhance  duty  and  tax  revenue \ncollection,  provide  a  platform  for  customs  information  and \ncommunications technology (ICT) to integrate into SEW and e-\ngovernment  systems,  reduce  trade  barriers,  and  improve  the \ninvestment environment. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $6.76 million \nequivalent, including contingencies and financing charges during \nthe implementation period.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  \nSource  Total  % \nCost \nADB Loan (Special Funds)  5.00       74.0 \ne-Asia and Knowledge         0.50         7.4 \n    Partnership Fund (Grant) \nGovernment   1.26       18.6 \n  Total  6.76  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank \n  Source: ADB estimates  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \nTerms  3,375,000  ($5  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The \nproposed loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 August 2010. \n   \n ", "iii \nEstimated Project  28 February 2010. \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established to oversee \nArrangements  the  Project  and  to  coordinate  issues  related  to  project \nimplementation.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  Vice  Minister  of \nFinance and will meet twice a year or as needed. ADB will attend \nthe PSC meetings as an observer.   \n \nA project management office (PMO) will be established within the \nMCGA to undertake day-to-day project implementation. The PMO \nwill be headed by a qualified PMO director acceptable to ADB. \nThe PMO will provide secretariat support to the PSC. \n \nMCGA will be the Implementing Agency, and the director general \nof MCGA will be the project director. The PMO director will report \nto the project director. \n \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance  \n   \nProcurement  Goods,  works  and  related  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the \nproposed  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to \ntime).  Contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures. \nContracts valued at less than $500,000 will be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  Before  NCB \nbegins,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocurement procedures to ensure they are consistent with ADB \nrequirements. Any modifications or clarifications to the Borrower\u2019s \nprocedures will be documented in the procurement plan. Minor \nitems of equipment and materials estimated to cost $100,000 or \nless will be procured through shopping procedures.  \n \n   \nConsulting Services  A  grant  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership  Fund  will  fund  a  total  of  4.5  person-months  of \ninternational and 44.5 person-months of national consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  either  as  individuals  following  the \nindividual  consultant\u2019s  selection  (ICS)  method  or  as  consulting \nfirm(s)  to  be  selected  following  the  consultants\u2019  qualification \nselection (CQS) method. The Government has agreed to recruit \nindividual consultants under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  While  working \nclosely with the PMO, the consultants will report simultaneously to \nADB and MCGA.  Services in relation to surveys and publications \nwill be engaged through the least cost selection (LCS) method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time).   \n   \n ", "iv \n   \nProject Benefits and  The proposed Project will strengthen implementation of continuing \nBeneficiaries  customs legal reforms and business process re-engineering. It will \nbe in line with Mongolia\u2019s recent accession to the Revised Kyoto \nConvention,  will  assist  the  Government  in  moving  toward  the \nnational SEW and e-government, and will mark an important step \nin mainstreaming governance in ADB\u2019s operations in Mongolia. \n \nMajor quantifiable economic benefits of the Project include the \neconomic impact of efficiency gains and trade expansion. The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at \n19.6%. Improved efficiency and governance will enhance revenue \ncollection by the customs. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks to the Project include (i) cost overruns in the migration \nand upgrading of the GAMAS, (ii) resistance from vested interest \ngroups  that  benefit  from  the  current  lack  of  transparency  and \ninefficient customs clearance system, (iii) inadequate or poorly \nimplemented new business processes, and (iv) insufficient budget \nprovision for operation and maintenance costs. \n \nContinued  and  strong  support  of  the  Government  will  mitigate \nthese risks. Good governance and proper supervision of the PMO \nand  other  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  is  also \nimportant.  Effective  coordination  among  related  government \nagencies will help to mitigate the risks.  \n   \nGrant Portion  Financing of the Project comprises a grant portion, to be provided \nby the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, funded by the \nRepublic  of  Korea.  The  grant  aims  to  ensure  the  successful \ncompletion of the Project by strengthening the institutional and \nhuman capacity of MCGA in project implementation. \n \nThe  grant  portion  amounts  to  $500,000  (including  a  $50,000 \ncontingency). It will mainly cover expenses for consulting services, \ntraining,  workshops,  conferences,  surveys,  materials,  and \npublications. \n \nMCGA will implement the grant in consultation with MOF. The \norganization and implementation arrangements for the loan will \nalso apply to the grant (including the PSC, project director, and \nPMO).  The grant and the loan will take effect simultaneously.  \n \n ", " \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan; and (ii) a proposed administration of a grant from the Government of the Republic of Korea  \nto Mongolia for the Customs Modernization Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Macroeconomic and Sector Context. The gross domestic product (GDP) of Mongolia \ngrew by 10.6% in 2004, the highest level of growth since 1990, mainly because of increased \noutput in the livestock and mining sectors. In 2005, high global prices for copper and gold and \nforeign direct investment continued to boost the mining industry, and the GDP grew by 6.2%. \nThe service sector, bolstered by increased tourism and trade, made a significant contribution to \ngrowth. For 2006\u20132010, GDP growth is expected to average 5% a year. Mongolia needs to \nencourage the tourism sector and trade, as its current narrowly based economy is vulnerable to \nweather-related natural disasters and declines in commodity prices. \n \n3.  Foreign trade plays an important part in Mongolia\u2019s economy.1 Foreign trade turnover \nreached $1.2 billion in 2000, and continued to increase by an average of 18.3% a year to \n$2.2 billion in 2005.  \n \n4.   Fiscal Revenue. Direct and indirect taxes are the major sources of fiscal revenue. State \ntaxes include personal income tax, corporate income tax, value added tax, customs duties, and \nexcise tax. Local taxes account for less than 10% of central Government\u2019s tax revenue. \n \n5.   The majority of state taxes are collected by the General Department of National Taxation \n(GDNT), which is under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The GDNT administers all categories of \nthe  state  taxes  not  otherwise  collected  by  the  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration \n(MCGA). \n \n6.   Customs Duties and Administration. The MCGA is also under the MOF and it collects \nrevenue from customs duties (for both imports and exports), excise tax, and value-added tax \n(VAT) on all goods imported for use, sale, or consumption in Mongolia.    \n \n7.   The legal basis of the MCGA is contained in the Customs Law of Mongolia, 1996.2 The \nCustoms Law defines the organizational structure of the customs and the principles, rules and \nprocedures of customs activities, control, clearance, statistics, and enforcement. The Customs \nLaw is being amended to take into account Mongolia\u2019s accession in 2006 to the International \nConvention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (the Revised Kyoto \nConvention).  \n \n                                                 \n1   World  Trade  Organization.  2005.  Trade  Policy  Review  (Mongolia)  \u2013  Report  by  the  Secretariat.  Available: \nhttp://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/s145-0_e.doc  \n2  Enacted on 1 July 1996 and since then amended seven times.  ", "2 \n8.   Other legislation related to MCGA\u2019s revenue collection authority includes (i) the Law on \nCustoms Tariff and Duties,3 (ii) the Excise Tax Law,4 and (iii) the VAT Law of Mongolia.5 In \naddition, MCGA also collects surcharges imposed on imports of motor gasoline and diesel fuel.  \nCustoms fees are also imposed for services provided by MCGA as laid down in customs \nregulations and orders. \n \n9.   MCGA Organization and Financial Management. MCGA has about 1,050 employees \norganized in nine divisions,6 three special entities,7 16 customs houses and offices, and 42 \ncustoms border posts8 under the leadership of one director general and two deputy directors \ngeneral.  \n10.   MCGA was one of the pilot government agencies required to prepare financial reports \nas part of the implementation of ADB-supported public sector management reforms.9 MCGA \nmaintains  accounting  records  and  prepares  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the \nAccounting  Law.10 MCGA  also  conducts  post-clearance  audits  and  undertakes  financial \ninspections. Although budget formulation for MCGA still relies on the previous year\u2019s actual \nspending, the Government\u2019s macroeconomic objectives are also taken into consideration in the \nbudgeting process. MCGA\u2019s financial management system is deemed generally adequate for \nthe proposed Project. \n \n11.   Sector Financing. The resources allocated by the Government to MCGA cover current \nexpenses  and  capital  investment.  Current  expenses  include  salaries  and  wages,  social \ninsurance,  and  operating  and  maintenance  expenses,  while  capital  investment  covers \nconstruction and rehabilitation of customs facilities and customs control equipment. In 2005, the \ntotal expenditure of MCGA amounted to $4 million and consisted of $2.5 million (63%) for \ncurrent expenses and $1.5 million (37%) for capital investment. In 2006, the allocation for \ncurrent expenses amounts to $2.88 million, while the allocation for capital investment has been \nincreased to $1.73 million. An additional allocation of $1.28 million has also been endorsed for \ncapital investment on customs facilities and control equipment. Total resources allocated in \n2006  for  capital  investment  have  therefore  reached  $3  million,  a  100%  increase  over  the \nprevious year.  \n12.   As shown in Table 1, the total customs revenues collected by MCGA in 2005 amounted \nto MNT291 billion. This was 34.9% of total Government revenues, or 13.6% of GDP. Customs \n                                                 \n3  A flat import tariff rate of 5% is applied to most imports, while export duty is imposed on a small number of goods, \nincluding raw cashmere, camel wool, wooden logs, and sawn timber products. Export taxes are imposed ad \nquantum, e.g., MNT4,000 per kilo of raw cashmere. \n4  The Excise Law provides for the imposition of excise duty on goods locally manufactured and on imported goods. \nThe goods subject to excise duty include (i) alcoholic beverages, (ii) tobacco and tobacco products (such as \ncigarettes), and (iii) passenger vehicles. \n5  Article 12 of the law provides for MCGA to administer the imposition and collection of the VAT on imported goods \nalong with the customs duties. The VAT rate has been reduced from 15% to 10% as approved by the Parliament \non 29 June 2006.   \n6  Consisting of (i) customs policy and international cooperation, (ii) revenue collection, (iii) risk management and \noperational control, (iv) customs enforcement, (v) post clearance audit, (vi) statistical information and monitoring, \n(vii) public management and governance, (viii) finance and investment, and (ix) information technology (IT). \n7   The Customs Central Laboratory, the Customs and Economic Institute, and the Detector Dogs Training Unit.  \n8  Out of the 42 customs border posts, 8 are permanent and the rest are seasonal.  \n9  ADB. 1999.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems Identified \n13.  Effectiveness  of  GAMAS.    The  MCGA  developed  a  customs  automated  data \nprocessing system (GAMAS) in 2002 to replace the ASYCUDA system11 used since 1996. \nGAMAS was first developed for a Microsoft Windows-based environment to capture customs \ndata from import and export declarations submitted by the trading community.  \n \n14.  GAMAS was written using Visual Basic, a programming language, and is designed to \nrun in an SQL environment.12 However, Visual Basic and SQL have been overtaken by more \nadvanced  programming  languages.13 Furthermore,  GAMAS  does  not  make  use  of  new \ntechnologies such as data warehousing or security features such as digital signatures. Because \nit lacks these features, GAMAS is primarily manually-operated and people-driven, i.e., traders \nare required to move from one customs processing point to another to seek official stamping \nand signatures. Human intervention in this process causes delays in customs clearance and is \nvulnerable to corrupt practices. It leads to a lack of transparency and to unpredictability.  \n \n15.  GAMAS\u2019s architecture is decentralized. The application system and database run on the \nlocal server of each customs house and border post. This is partly due to the vastness of the \ncountry and partly due to the lack of reliable communication infrastructure. Data are transmitted \nto the main database server at MCGA headquarters once a day if possible, but in most cases \nonly weekly. Border posts without telephone lines send data to headquarters on a floppy disk. \nThis  process  is  a  major  impediment  to  uploading  daily  transactions  from  local  production \nservers to the main database. Likewise, whenever there is any change to the codes or a system \nupgrade, the updated information has to be transmitted to the various servers over the network \nor  using  a  floppy  disk.  This  leads  to  time  lags,  often  lasting  several  days,  and  makes  it \nimpossible to achieve a synchronized system and data upgrade across all customs houses.  \n \n                                                 \n11  Automated system for customs data developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. \n12  Structured query language, a computer language designed to store, manipulate, and retrieve data stored in \nrelational databases. \n13  Such as Java using J2EE technology. \n ", "4 \n16.  The unreliability of the transmission mechanism may lead to a loss of data, which may \nnot be detected. The time lag in transmission of data to the central database does not allow \nreal-time compilation of reports and statistics, an essential tool for decision-making. Currently, \nthere is not enough server capacity to run GAMAS and customs brokers and traders have \ncomplained that its processing speed is too slow. This situation can be partly attributed to a \nsteady and significant increase in the volume of customs declarations over the period 2001\u2013\n2005.  \n \n17.  Additional functionalities are needed for GAMAS so it can track and monitor imported \ngoods stored in public or private customs bonded warehouses (CBW) efficiently. While goods \nare temporarily stored in CBW, customs duties and other taxes are suspended until they are \nintroduced into the local market. As MCGA does not maintain an electronic inventory system \nand manual records are kept by the CBW operators for monthly submission to MCGA, there is a \nrisk of goods being withdrawn illegally, particularly from private CBWs.  \n \n18.  In short, the programming tools, functionalities, and communications infrastructure of \nGAMAS need upgrading to meet the increasing demands of customs control and administration. \nModern customs business processes, such as risk management, post clearance audits, and \nelectronic submission of trade documents, cannot be effectively and widely introduced without \nan internet-enabled system and a centralized database. \n \n19.  Customs Physical Infrastructure. Customs inspection equipment and anti-smuggling \ndetection facilities are inadequate in most customs border posts. A physical inspection of a \nmajor border crossing at Zamyn-Uud, close to Erlian in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nrevealed that the customs infrastructure was inadequate. The border post had only one terminal \nfor passengers and cargo. The road outside the Zamyn-Uud customs office serves as a holding \narea and inspection centre. Delays in customs clearance result in long queues of cargo vehicles \noutside the office.  \n \n20.  Laboratories  are  unavailable  outside  the  Central  Customs  Laboratory  (CCL)  in \nUlaanbaatar. The absence of laboratories in regional customs houses is unfavorable to effective \ncollection of revenue and the prevention of smuggling of illegal goods. Imports of petroleum are \naffected by the lack of laboratories as the basis for taxes is the octane strength of the fuel. The \npresent approach of sending the samples to the CCL, often over long distances, causes delays.  \nTransportation time may range from 5 to 7 days, which means longer clearance times for the \ncargo.  \n \n21.  Governance Issues and Vulnerability to Abuses. The vulnerability of the customs \nadministration to abuses such as corruption has been highlighted by a number of recent surveys \nand assessments of governance in Mongolia. These include a perception index14 issued by the \nMongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) and an assessment report15 \nfinanced by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Mongolia was \nranked    85  out  of  159  nations  in  the  Transparency  International  (TI)  2005  Corruption \nPerceptions Index.16  \n \n                                                 \n14  MNCCI. 2005.

In the country performance assessment ratings conducted by ADB in 2005, Mongolia\u2019s \nscore  was  at  par  with  the  average  of  all  ADF  countries  with  respect  to  \u201ctransparency, \naccountability and corruption\u201d.17 The 2004 ADB governance assessment of Mongolia18 indicated \nthat the import taxes collected still fall short of their potential because of exemptions, collection \ninefficiencies, and corruption. The report referred to a study made by the Korea Institute of \nPublic Finance, which suggested a number of measures to improve tax administration practices \nand efficiency, including enhancing computerization, improving staff training, and preparing \nmanuals to decrease inspectors\u2019 discretionary powers. These ideas have been incorporated in \nthe design of this Project. \n \n23.  Partnership  with  the  Private  Sector.  Efficient  and  effective  observance  and \nenforcement of customs laws, rules, and regulations cannot be achieved unless the private \nsector, in particular the trade community, understands and supports the legal requirements, \ncomprehends the procedures to be followed, and is provided with information and services to \nfacilitate their compliance. Upstream involvement and feedback from the private sector are \ncritical for an information and communications technology (ICT) and business-process-driven \ncustoms  modernization  project,  as  the  success  of  the  project  will  also  depend  on  the \nacceptability of the new system to private sector end users. Feedback from the private sector \nwill also be conducive to timely adjustment of policy and regulations, and to preventing abuses \nand corruption.  \n24.  MCGA has been paying increasing attention to the customs\u2013business partnership. To \nthis end, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in March 2006 between MCGA \nand MNCCI. This provides a framework for regular consultative meetings for representatives \nfrom customs administrations and business associations. MCGA is also planning to expand \ncustoms\u2013business  partnerships,  including  exchanging  information  of  mutual  concern, \nestablishing  official  channels  for  consultations,  and  sharing  best  practices  on  customs \nwarehouses, bonded exhibition sites, and customs special zones. Further work needs to be \ndone  on  performance  surveys  of  customs  services  and  private  sector  involvement  in  the \nupgrading of GAMAS.  \n \n2.  Opportunities  \n25.  Support for Trade Facilitation. Since 1990, Mongolia has gradually evolved into a \nprivate-sector-led and market-oriented economy. As a land-locked country situated between the \ntwo large economies of the PRC and the Russian Federation, Mongolia needs a sound trading \nenvironment  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  and  to  leverage  transit  trade  for  its  rapid \neconomic development and poverty reduction. Mongolia joined the World Customs Organization \n(WCO)19 in 1991 and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997, and acceded to a number \nof conventions, including the Revised Kyoto Convention.20 From the time of its accession to \nWTO, Mongolia has brought down its tariff rate from 15% to 5% across the board on most \nimported goods. This constitutes an almost 70% cut in the tariffs for a country that has no import \nquotas.  \n \n                                                 \n17 The score was 3.0 on a scale of 1 (very weak performance) to 6 (very strong performance).

Manila.  \n19 The WCO currently comprises 170 members. Its mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of customs \nadministrations and help them contribute to the achievement of national development objectives, particularly in the \nfields of trade facilitation, revenue collection, protection of society, and supply chain security. \n20  Mongolia deposited its instrument of accession on 1 July 2006.  \n ", "6 \n26.  The revised Customs Law and the Customs Tariff Law have been prepared by the \nGovernment  for  consideration  by  Parliament  in  the  autumn  session  of  2006.  The  revised \nCustoms Law follows the requirements of the Revised Kyoto Convention and is designed to \nmodernize the legal environment in line with the Project.21   \n \n27.  Mongolia is pursuing bilateral and regional customs cooperation with its neighboring \ncountries. The MCGA and the PRC customs held their third meeting on the pilot testing of joint \ncustoms  border  control  in  April  2006.  At  that  meeting  they  discussed  the  possibility  of \nharmonizing cargo manifests. A tripartite transit traffic agreement is expected to be signed soon \nby the PRC, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation. The PRC\u2019s accession to the WTO and \nnegotiations on the Russian Federation\u2019s accession will undoubtedly create new prospects for \ncooperation.  \n \n28.  Government  Information  and  Communications  Technology  Policy.  The \ndevelopment of the ICT sector is a key priority for the Government. In October 2004, the \nInformation Communications Technology Authority (ICTA) was established and placed directly \nunder  the  Prime  Minister.  Its  role  is  to  regulate  and  coordinate  ICT  policies,  which  was \npreviously the responsibility of the Ministry of Infrastructure. The establishment of the ICTA laid \nthe foundation for Mongolia\u2019s ICT agenda.    \n \n29.  In October 2005, the Government of Mongolia adopted the \u201ce-Mongolia\u201d program, which \nenvisages that, by 2012, Mongolia will become one of the top ten countries in Asia in terms of \nICT development.  \n \n30.  Also in 2005, the Government and the Korean IT Industry Promotion Agency (KIPA) \nformulated an e-government master plan for 2005\u20132010. Its objective is to develop national \ncompetitiveness and enhance the quality of the public service through an efficient, effective, \nsystematic and productive e-government system. Under the plan, Government agencies will \nprovide on-line services to the general public. It envisages computerization of all government \nservices, integration of government information systems, and standardization of government \nadministration. The migration and upgrading of the GAMAS at MCGA is part of the e-Mongolia \nand e-government initiatives.  \n \n31.  A single electronic window (SEW)22 service has been incorporated into the MCGA\u2019s \nstrategic plan for 2006\u20132008. The objective is paperless declaration and online processing at all \ncustoms houses and border posts, remote access to customs data, and an online exchange of \ninformation with related government and nongovernment organizations.  \n \n32.  Government Commitment to Good Governance. The Government is committed to \ngood governance, transparency, and accountability of public administration. In November 2001, \nthe Government formally endorsed the Anticorruption Action Plan for the Asia-Pacific23 and \n                                                 \n21  For instance, the draft Customs Law requires that \u201cin the application of Customs control, the Customs shall use \nrisk management\u201d (Article 5.3). The MCGA is required to apply customs IT for speedy transmission of foreign- \ntrade-related documents, timely exchange of information, and simplification of customs procedures (Article 75.1). \nThe Goods declaration may be lodged in writing or through the electronic information exchange network (Article \n44.1) and the electronic documents certified by digital or electronic signature form shall be considered original \ndocuments (Article 42.5.1). \n22 SEW is an integrated electronic platform that allows the parties involved in trade and logistics to lodge standardized \ninformation and documents with a single point of entry, and to fulfill regulatory requirements through one-time \nsubmission of individual pieces of data.  \n23The action plan resulted from a joint initiative of ADB and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment. Available: http://www1.oecd.org/daf/ASIAcom \n ", "7 \nprepared a \u201cto do list\u201d,24 including 10 steps to accelerate implementation of a National Program \nfor Combating Corruption (NPCC), approved by the Parliament in July 2002. In January 2006, \nMongolia  ratified  the  United  Nations  Convention  against  Corruption  (UNCAC).25 An  Anti-\ncorruption Law was passed by Parliament on 6 July 2006. \n \n33.   The  action  plan  of  the  Government  for  2004\u20132008  includes  a  section  on  public \nadministration and civil participation, which provides guidance on how to create conditions for \npublic services online, including customs clearance. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Operations \n34.  ADB\u2019s Strategy. ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program (CSP)26 for Mongolia was \nadopted in October 2005, and covers the period 2006\u20132008. The CSP focused on two major \npillars of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: stable and broad-based growth, and \ninclusive social development. The CSP also noted that weak governance could pose a risk to \nthe achievement of CSP objectives if the recent deterioration was not arrested. In addition to \nongoing  assistance  on  financial  governance 27 and  the  implementation  of  Public  Sector \nManagement and Finance Law reforms in social sectors, the CSP underscored the need for \nintegrating governance into sector projects.  \n \n35.  Recognizing  that  customs  reforms  and  modernization  are  priorities  if  governance \npractices  and  the  investment  climate  for  the  private  sector  are  to  improve,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  agreed  to  include  the  current  project  in  the  2006  lending  program.28 The \nadjustment to the 2006 lending program was reflected in the CSP update (CSPU), 2007\u20132009 \nfor Mongolia, which was approved in September 2006.29 The project is directly relevant to the \nfirst pillar of the CSP, as customs modernization will facilitate and promote trade, which is an \nengine for economic growth and development. \n \n36.  ADB  Assistance  in  Trade  Facilitation.  Regional  trade  facilitation  and  customs \ncooperation  is  one  of  the  four  priority  areas  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  Program,  begun  in  1997  by  ADB.30 The  program  on  regional  trade \nfacilitation and customs cooperation is coordinated by the Customs Cooperation Committee \n(CCC), consisting of the heads of the customs administrations of the CAREC countries. The \nprogram  aims  to  promote  concerted  customs  reforms  and  modernization,  and  to  support \ninteragency cooperation and partnership with the private sector.  \n                                                 \n24 Government  of  Mongolia.  10  Steps  to  Accelerate  Implementation  of  the  National  Anticorruption  Plan.

Manila.  \n28  There is no project preparatory technical assistance for the proposed Project. However, an ADB-funded needs \nassessment on trade facilitation and customs modernization in Mongolia and the preliminary findings from a study \non Mongolia trade facilitation and logistics development strategy have been extensively used in the project design.   \n29 ADB. 2006. Mongolia: Country Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009). Manila. \n30 Over the years, CAREC has evolved into a multicountry and multi-institutional framework that comprises eight \nparticipating  countries  (Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nMongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and an alliance of six multilateral institutions (ADB, the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, the United \nNations Development Programme, and the World Bank), with ADB serving as the program secretariat. The four \npriority areas of CAREC are transport, trade facilitation, trade policy, and energy. ADB takes the lead in transport \nand trade facilitation, while the International Monetary Fund takes the lead in trade policy and the World Bank in \nthe energy sector.  \n ", "8 \n \n37.  Since the first CCC meeting in 2002, the program has addressed (i) the simplification \nand  harmonization  of  customs  procedures,  (ii) development  of  simplified  transit  systems, \n(iii) data sharing and ICT for customs modernization, and (iv) risk management and post-entry \naudit. The program uses a pragmatic and results-oriented approach, which encourages country-\nspecific customs modernization and bilateral initiatives. ADB\u2019s support includes the provision of \ntechnical assistance for analytical work and capacity building, and project loans for customs \nmodernization.31   \n \n38.   Mongolia  is  an  active  participant  in  the  CCC,  and  co-hosted  its  fourth  meeting  in \nSeptember 2005 in Ulaanbaatar. Concurrently, a National Trade Facilitation Committee was \nestablished in 2005 under the auspices of the MNCCI. This provides an institutional basis for \nmoves toward broad-based and integrated trade facilitation. \n   \n39.   In 2005, ADB funded a customs modernization needs assessment32 for Mongolia. The \nGovernment reviewed the findings of the assessment report and subsequently asked ADB to \ndevelop a project to be included in the lending program for 2006, to address the shortcomings \nand finance the investments identified in the assessment. Another study funded by ADB is being \nfinalized,  which  aims  to  integrate  CAREC\u2019s  ongoing  cross-border  customs-driven  trade \nfacilitation initiatives with \u201cbehind-the-border\u201d trade facilitation initiatives, and to provide help in \nformulating a trade facilitation and logistics development strategy for Mongolia.  \n \n40.   ADB takes the lead in regional transport cooperation under the CAREC program. In July \n2004, an ADF loan was approved to fund the construction of a road between Choyr and Zamyn-\nUud, which forms part of Mongolia\u2019s north\u2013south road transport corridor linking the highway \nnetworks of the PRC and the Russian Federation, and passing through major economic centers \nof Mongolia.33 Another regional road project in western Mongolia has been programmed under \nboth CAREC and Mongolia\u2019s CSP 2006\u20132008. This will develop the Altai road transport corridor \nlinking southwest Siberia in the Russian Federation with the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nof  the  PRC.34 These  regional  transport  projects  will  accelerate  and  greatly  enhance  trade \nfacilitation and regional cooperation if they are accompanied by customs modernization.  \n \n4.  Lessons  \n41.  Lessons that can be applied to this Project are largely drawn from regional activities \nunder  the  auspices  of  the  CCC.  Knowledge-sharing  has  been  a  major  component  of \ncooperation under the CCC, in particular the experience of automated customs services, and  \nseveral CCC meetings have been devoted to this purpose.35 Other customs administrations in \nCAREC countries have developed or are developing their own unified automated information \nsystems  (UAIS).  Regional  customs  modernization  and  infrastructure  development  projects \nsupported by ADB are currently being implemented in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2004.

Major lessons reflected in the project design include the following. \n \n(i)  ICT upgrading should be preceded by customs legal reforms and associated \nbusiness process reengineering, so as to avoid computerizing outdated customs \nprocedures.36  \n(ii)  It is important to formulate at the very outset an ICT master plan, which aims at \nproviding strategic guidance for integrated investment on customs modernization. \n(iii)  No  single  existing  ICT  solution  is  considered  ideal  for  all  customs \nadministrations. The key is to ensure that the ICT systems in different trade-\nrelated agencies in or across the countries are able to interface with each other. \n(iv)  E-payment and revenue reconciliation systems are useful tools in ensuring real-\ntime and accurate matching between the amount specified in the declaration \nform and the payment received by the customs.37 \n(v)  Backup and security solutions for ICT systems becomes more important as the \ncustoms administration moves toward paperless declaration and a centralized \ndatabase environment. \n(vi)  Customs  modernization  is  a  long-term  and  costly  endeavor,  which  requires \ncomprehensive planning, and phased development and roll-out. \n(vii)  Users must be well-trained in the system, so they can use it optimally and \nmaintain and upgrade it.  \n(viii)  Migration from manual operation to automation and from client servers to an \ninternet-enabled system should be accompanied by a change in management \nprocesses.  \n(ix)  Normal  functioning  and  regular  upgrading38 of  the  ICT  systems  will  entail \nrecurrent expenses, which have to be fully budgeted for. \n \n5.  External Assistance \n43.   In addition to ADB, the Government is working with a number of other international \ninstitutions  and  bilateral  aid  partners  on  customs  modernization  and  related  areas.  These \ninclude  (i)  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO),  which  provides  training  on  customs \nvaluations, rules of origin, the Revised Kyoto Convention, and the framework of standards; (ii) \nthe World Bank, which recently approved a grant project for governance assistance to Mongolia, \nunder  which  a  subcomponent  will  be  dedicated  to strengthening  tax  administration  by  the \nGDNT; (iii) the PRC customs, which donated an X-ray machine for non-intrusive inspection of \ncargo at Zamyn\u2013Uud border post; and (iv) the Government of the Republic of Korea, which \nprovided technical assistance to help prepare an ICT master plan for Mongolian e-Customs.39 \nMore details on external assistance to Mongolian customs are in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n36 Protocol of Missions in the ICT Working Group, Seminar on Trade Facilitation and Customs Modernization, 4\u20138 \nAugust 2003, Issyk-Kul, the Kyrgyz Republic.

As a recipient of assistance from various organizations, the Government is keen to \nimprove the synergy of related programs and initiatives, and to ensure a smooth interface \nbetween ADB\u2019s support for e-customs and the World Bank\u2019s support for e-tax. Direct contacts \nhave been established and maintained between ADB and other funding agencies. There is a \nclear division of labor among the funding agencies, who regularly follow up and exchange \ninformation on their programs. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n45.  The Project aims to increase the volume and facilitate the smooth flow of Mongolia\u2019s \nexternal trade. This will be achieved by improving efficiency, transparency, and sustainability in \ncustoms services and administration. The Project will help lower the incidence of corruption and \nsmuggling, enhance duty and tax revenue collection, provide a platform for customs ICT to \nintegrate  into  SEW  and  e-government  systems,  reduce  trade  barriers,  and  improve  the \ninvestment environment.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n46.  The  Project  will  comprise  (i)  migration  and  upgrading  of  the  GAMAS  for  customs \nservices and administration, which will be made internet-based and interfaced within a national \nSEW for e-government; (ii) improvement of the infrastructure at selected major customs houses \nand customs border posts; and (iii) institutional strengthening.  \n \n1.  Migrating and Upgrading of GAMAS \n47.   This  component  includes  (i)  migrating  and  upgrading  the  GAMAS  to  provide  an \nelectronic processing environment supporting internet-enabled and Windows-based systems, \n(ii) interfacing GAMAS with the planned national SEW as part of e-government initiatives, and \n(iii) improvement of communications and network infrastructure. \n \n2.  Improvement of Customs Infrastructure     \n \n48.  The second component includes (i) improving customs border facilities and provision of \nequipment,  such  as  X-ray  machines  and  surveillance  equipment  at  selected  key  customs \nhouses and border posts, and (ii) provision of equipment to enhance the analytical capacity of \ncustoms  laboratories.  This  component  includes  construction  of  a  data  center  in  the  new \nheadquarters building of MCGA and expansion of the cargo terminal at the border control \ncomplex in Zamyn-Uud, which will be funded by the Government.  \n \n3.  Institutional Strengthening  \n \n49.  Institutional strengthening comprises: (i) implementation and further enhancement of \nbusiness processes; (ii) training in relation to the first two components, following a detailed \ntraining plan to be formulated at the beginning of project implementation; (iii) promotion of \ninteragency coordination, in particular with the State Specialized Inspection Agency (SSIA) and \nthe Mongolia Agency for Standardization and Metrology (MASM), and regional cooperation with \n ", "11 \nneighboring and CAREC countries;40 and (iv) public\u2013private sector partnerships, which includes \nsupport for private sector consultation and participation, and conducting quality and compatibility \ntesting of software used by the trading community (including traders, customs brokers, logistics \noperators, and banks) for interfacing with the upgraded GAMAS in an electronic processing \nenvironment. Because some customs staff may find it hard to use the new technology and more \nadvanced equipment, training of trainers and users,41 and maintenance training will be carried \nout. A manual of reengineered business processes will be prepared.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n50.   The Project is linked to three key Government initiatives: trade facilitation, e-government, \nand good governance. The Government strongly supports the Project and is eager to implement \nit in 3 years. Other notable features include (i) the use of local expertise to the extent possible \nfor upgrading GAMAS (building on previous in-house software development under the current \nGAMAS); (ii) implementation of one-stop services for customs clearances, laying the foundation \nfor inter-agency coordination, and moving forward the Government\u2019s plan on e-government and \ne-Mongolia; and (iii) the way the Project complements other ADB initiatives to promote regional \ntrade facilitation under the CCC. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n51.  The  Project\u2019s  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $6.76  million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies  and  financing  charges  during  the  implementation  period.  The  costs  are \nsummarized in Table 2. Detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nProject Component  Amounts \nA. Base Costa \n     1.

Financing Plan \n52.  The Government has requested a loan of $5 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources,  representing  74%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  Project.  The  Borrower  will  be \nMongolia. The proposed loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.  \n \n53.   Most activities in relation to institutional strengthening under the Project will be funded by \nan  untied  grant  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund, \nadministered by ADB.42 This will amount to $500,000 and will cover 7.4% of the total project \ncost.  \n \n54.  Mongolia will provide the remaining $1.26 million equivalent as counterpart financing. \nThis  will  include  financing  part  of  the  infrastructure  improvement  at  selected  key  customs \nhouses,43 taxes  and  duties,  and  an  in-kind  contribution  for  project  implementation  and \nmanagement. The counterpart financing will account for 18.6% of the total investment.

The financing of the Project includes a grant portion, which comes from the e-Asia and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2006. Republic of Korea: e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. Manila. \n43 Namely, (i) construction of a data center, for $257,000, as part of the new MCGA headquarters building; \n(ii) expansion of the cargo terminal at the border control complex in Zamyn-Uud for $180,000; and (iii) provision of \ncustoms inspection equipment to customs houses in Zamyn-Uud and at the Central Post Office, for $71,000. \n44 The maximum percentage of the total cost of loan projects in Mongolia that ADB may finance used to be 80% (a \ncommon percentage for group A countries under ADB\u2019s classification of DMCs). This rule applied until 25 August \n2005, the date on which the ADB Board approved a new cost sharing policy (ADB. 2005. Cost Sharing and \nEligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. Manila). This required that the \ncost-sharing ceiling be set during the CSP preparation for the DMC concerned and for the aggregate ADB portfolio \nover the CSP period. Since the new ceiling for Mongolia will not be determined until the next country partnership \nstrategy, the cost sharing limit of 80% for ADB in the loan project is still applicable (see para. 5, Operations Manual \nSection H3/OP). So far, ADB has approved only one project loan to Mongolia in 2006 (ADB. 2006. Third Education \nDevelopment Project. Manila), in which the ADB loan amounted to $13 million and government counterpart \nfinancing to $3.38 million. With this second ADB loan to Mongolia in 2006, on an aggregate basis, ADB loans will \namount to 77.8% of the combined total project costs and Government counterpart financing to 20% (the remaining \n2.2% will be covered by the grant portion).  \n ", "13 \n1.  Objective and Outputs \n56.  The grant aims to ensure the successful completion of the Project within 3 years through \nstrengthening the institutional and human capacity of MCGA in project implementation.  \n \n57.  Major outputs of the grant will include (i) simplified and improved business processes, \n(ii) upgraded  ICT  skills  of  customs  officers  and  personnel,  (iii)  improved  coordination  with \nrelated agencies (including the SSIA and the MASM), (iv) enhanced partnership with the private \nsector, and (iv) deeper cooperation with customs of neighboring countries. \n \n2.  Grant-Financed Activities \n58.  The $500,000 (including a $50,000 contingency) grant will cover eligible costs in relation \nto institutional strengthening under the Project. The Government counterpart financing for the \ngrant amounts to $90,000 and will cover office accommodation and furniture for the consultants \nto be engaged under the grant, the imputed value of counterpart staff, and other contributions in \nkind. Major expenses and activities to be covered by the grant will include consulting services,45 \ntraining, workshops and conferences, surveys, and materials and publications. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan for the grant are in Appendix 6. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n59.  Executing and Implementing Agencies. MOF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for \nthe Project and MCGA will be the Implementing Agency (IA). The EA is responsible for the \noverall execution and coordination of the Project, including endorsing disbursement applications \nunder the proposed loan, and the overall management and monitoring of the Project. The IA is \nresponsible for the timely and satisfactory implementation of the Project. \n \n60.  Project Steering Committee (PSC). A PSC will be established to oversee the Project \nand to coordinate issues related to Project implementation. The PSC will be chaired by Vice \nMinister of Finance. The members will be representatives of MOF, GDNT, MCGA, Ministry of \nIndustry and Trade (MIT), Information Communications Technology Authority (ICTA), SSIA, \nMASM, and MNCCI. The PSC will be established and will hold its first meeting within 1 month of \nloan effectiveness. It will meet twice a year or as needed to review the progress of the Project \nand guide the future direction of the Project. ADB will attend the PSC meetings as an observer. \n \n61.  Project Director. The director general of MCGA will be the project director and will \nrepresent  the  IA  for  the  purpose  of  this  Project.  The  project  director  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for project implementation and may appoint a senior member of staff from the \nMCGA as his alternate.   \n \n62.  Project Management Office (PMO). A PMO will be established in the MCGA within 1 \nmonth of loan effectiveness to undertake day-to-day project implementation. The PMO will be \nheaded by a qualified director selected on a competitive basis with selection arrangements that \nare acceptable to ADB. The PMO director will (i) coordinate the activities under the Project; \n(ii) be directly responsible for overall project quality, monitoring, and supervision; and (iii) report \n                                                 \n45  Please see paras. 67\u201368 and Appendix 9 for more details on the fields of expertise and engagement of consulting \nservices to be financed by the Fund.  \n ", "14 \nto the project director. The PMO director will be assisted by a group of qualified technical and \nadministrative specialists, including an ICT and procurement specialist, and a finance and \nadministrative officer. These staff will also be selected on a competitive basis with selection \narrangements that are acceptable to ADB. The PMO will remain adequately staffed throughout \nthe project implementation and will be supported by consultants, interpreters, and contractual \nstaff as needed.  \n \n63.  The PMO\u2019s responsibilities will include the following: (i) secretariat support to the PSC; \n(ii) planning and scheduling of project activities; (iii) administration of procurement activities; \n(iv) bookkeeping and maintenance of project accounts, and preparation of liquidation and claim \nreports; (v) implementation of the work program of the Project; (vi) supervision and monitoring of \nthe work program of the Project and project performance; (vii) preparation and submission of \nvarious reports to ADB and the MOF, including quarterly and annual project monitoring and \nprogress reports; (viii) coordination of field activities; and (ix) liaison with ADB, government \nagencies, and private sector stakeholders.  \n \n64.  Implementation Arrangements for Grant Portion. MCGA will implement the grant in \nconsultation with MOF. The organization and implementation arrangements for the loan will \napply to the grant (including the PSC, project director, and PMO).  The grant and the loan will \ntake effect simultaneously. The grant will be implemented until the completion of the loan \nproject.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n65.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years, from March 2007 to February 2010. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n66.  Goods, works, and related services to be financed out of the proposed ADB loan will be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to \ntime). Contracts valued at $500,000 or more will be procured through international competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  using \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. Before commencement of NCB procurement, \nADB and the Borrower will review the Borrower\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure they are \nconsistent  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocedures  will  be  documented  in  the  procurement  plan.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and \nmaterials estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured through shopping procedures. The \nEA and IA were advised of the need to maintain transparency and accountability in procuring \ngoods, works and services, as required under ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date).46 The procurement plan is in Appendix 8.   \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n67.  The grant will fund a total of 4.5 person-months of international and 44.5 person-months \nof  national  consultants.  The  consultants  will  work  on  business  processes  and  ICT \nimplementation (4.5 person-months international, and 5 person-months national), interagency \ncoordination (3.5 person-months national), and project performance monitoring (36 person-\nmonths national). A draft of the outline terms of reference is in Appendix 9. \n                                                 \n46 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  \n ", "15 \n \n68.   The consultants will be engaged either as individuals following the individual consultant\u2019s \nselection  (ICS)  method  or  as  consulting  firm(s)  to  be  selected  following  the  consultants\u2019 \nqualification  selection  (CQS)  method.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  recruit  individual \nconsultants under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) for recruiting individual consultants. While working \nclosely with the PMO, the consultants will report simultaneously to ADB and MCGA. Services in \nrelation to surveys and publications will be engaged through the least-cost selection (LCS) \nmethod  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n69.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  EA  and  IA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing \nAgency and Implementing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n70.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.47 To expedite project implementation through the timely release of loan proceeds, \nimmediately  after  loan  effectiveness  the  Government  will  open  an  imprest  account  at  a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB with an initial deposit of $100,000 equivalent from loan \nproceeds. The imprest account will be managed and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and other arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. The \nceiling of total advances in the imprest account at any time is not to exceed the estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is less. Direct \npayment procedures will be used to withdraw loan funds amounting to $100,000 equivalent or \nabove for direct payment to designated suppliers and contractors. Statement of expenditure \n(SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenses and liquidate advances from the \nimprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE \nprocedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot checks of \nexpenditures covered by SOE through review missions. Sufficient supporting documentation, as \ndefined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be kept to substantiate all expenditures \nincurred from the loan proceeds. In addition to the loan imprest account, a grant imprest \naccount  will  be  established  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  shall  be \nestablished, managed, replenished and liquidated in the same manner as the loan imprest \naccount.  \n \n                                                 \n47  ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila.  \n ", "16 \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n71.  To ensure effective implementation, there will be continued monitoring and evaluation of \nthe Project, with timely reporting. The PMO will furnish brief quarterly and annual reports to \nADB, to be submitted within 1 month after the period to which they relate, indicating progress \nmade and problems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to be taken \nto remedy the problems, proposed program of activities, and expected progress during the \nfollowing period. Within 3 months of completion of the physical project, the EA will submit to \nADB a project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of implementation progress, \ncosts,  benefits,  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  and  other  details \nrequested by ADB. \n \n72.  The PMO  will maintain separate accounts and prepare financial statements for the \nProject according to international accounting standards. The PMO will arrange to have the \nproject account and related financial statements audited annually by independent auditors with \nsatisfactory qualifications and experience in international accounting and auditing acceptable to \nADB.  The audit report will cover the audited project account and the financial statements for \neach fiscal year (including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with \nloan covenants and the use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure \nprocedures). It will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year.  \n \n73.  The  Government  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  that  the  audited  project \naccount and financial statements be submitted on time and of the possible suspension of \ndisbursements  under  the  proposed  ADB  loan  in  the  event  of  non-compliance  with  this \nrequirement. \n \n8.  Project Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n74.  To  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance to stakeholders, ADB uses the project performance management system (PPMS). \nWithin 1 year of loan effectiveness, MCGA will establish an appropriate PPMS in the PMO, as \nagreed with ADB. Under the PPMS, the PMO will periodically review the Project to assess and \nevaluate  its  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and \nachievements. Project monitoring and evaluation reports will be submitted by the PMO to ADB \non  a  quarterly  basis.  On  project  completion,  the  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  evaluated \naccording to a schedule and terms of reference to be agreed by the EA and ADB. \n \n9.  Project Review \n75.  ADB will conduct a loan inception mission within 3 months of loan effectiveness.  ADB \nand the EA will jointly review the Project implementation twice a year and will monitor the overall \nperformance of the PMO. After 1.5 years of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review of \nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out  jointly  by  the  EA  and  ADB,  to  identify  any  problems  and \nconstraints encountered and assess the need for a mid-course modification of the project scope \nand implementation arrangements. Technical and budgetary changes to the initial design in the \nproject document, arising from PPMS findings, will also be considered, as will be the inclusion of \nadditional activities or the consideration of a possible expansion of activities or areas over the \nremaining project life. \n \n ", "17 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n76.  The proposed Project will strengthen implementation of the continuing customs legal \nreforms and the business process reengineering required by Mongolia\u2019s recent accession to the \nRevised Kyoto Convention. It will help the Government move toward a national SEW and e-\ngovernment.    It  will  also  mark  an  important  step  in  mainstreaming  governance  in  ADB\u2019s \noperations in Mongolia, and complement the World Bank\u2019s Governance Assistance Project.48 \nThe Project is expected to reduce the processing time for customs clearance and therefore to \nresult in trade expansion.   \n \n77.  Other benefits of the proposed Project include (i) prevention of smuggling and drug \ntrafficking through the establishment of a central database, timely exchange of information on \nhazardous  goods,  better  inspection  equipment,  and  more  effective  customs  laboratories; \n(ii) reduced corruption, improved governance, and enhanced revenue collection by improving \nthe  transparency  of  customs  services,  and  minimizing  direct  interfaces  between  customs \nofficers and traders and their representatives; (iii) strengthened human resource management \nand institutional capacity; (iv) improved coordination between customs and related agencies; \n(v) improved  relationship  betweens  customs  and  the  business  community  through  public\u2013\nprivate partnerships; and (vi) support for regional customs cooperation through the provision of \nICT infrastructure to address issues of common concerns such as transit development, joint \nborder control, and data-sharing. \n \n78.  Assuming  that  major  economic  benefits  can  be  quantified  to  include  the  economic \nimpact of efficiency gains and trade expansion, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \nthe Project is estimated to be 19.6%. Sensitivity analysis that was based on assumed changes \nin three key variables49 suggested that the EIRR of this Project would stay within an acceptable \nrange of 16.1% to 22.9%.50 \n \n79.   Major risks that may adversely affect delivery of the outputs and outcome of the Project \nand achievement of its impact include: \n \n(i)  cost overruns in upgrading GAMAS to an internet-enabled system;  \n(ii)  inadequate or poorly implemented business processes;  \n(iii)  MCGA\u2019s inability to retain competent and experienced ICT personnel; \n(iv)  inability  of  some  customs  staff  to  make  use  of  new  technology  and  more \nadvanced equipment, or to go along with change management;  \n(v)  lack of coordination with trade-related agencies; \n(vi)  resistance from vested interest groups that benefit from lack of transparency and \ninefficient customs clearance systems;  \n(vii)  misunderstanding and/or lack of support from the trade community and other \nparts of the private sector; and \n(viii)  lack of working capital or insufficient budget provision for operations, routine \nmaintenance, and upgrading of the new ICT systems. \n \n                                                 \n48  More information available: \nhttp://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228\n424&Projectid=P098426 \n49  In other words, the effects of possible changes in three key variables: (i) scenario 1 \u2013 benefits from trade \nexpansion only attain half of the projection in the base scenario, (ii) scenario 2 \u2013 efficiency gains outperform the base \nscenario by 20%, and (iii) scenario 3 \u2013 project costs exceed the estimates in the base scenario by 20%. \n50  See Supplementary Appendix B. \n ", "18 \n80.  These risks are mitigated in the project design and Government assurances. The grant \nresources administered by ADB will help to strengthen project implementation through the \ndeployment  of  experienced  international  and  national  consultants.  Further  support  will  be \nprovided by regular ADB review and monitoring missions. The Project incorporates measures \nfor  capacity  building  and  training,  public\u2013private  partnership,  interagency  coordination,  and \nregional cooperation. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n81.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the information technology division of MCGA \nwill be provided with adequate technical staff dealing with customs automation \nsystems throughout the project implementation. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  IA  implements  the  training  plan  to  be \nfinanced under this project. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nto the Project when and in the amounts required to enable Project agencies to \ndischarge their responsibilities under the Project; and to cover any shortfall of \nfunding for the completion of the Project. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that necessary budget allocations will be provided to \nmeet the recurrent costs under the Project for the operation and maintenance of \nthe Project both during Project implementation and after Project completion. \n(v)  The Government will provide adequate office space, including for consultants \nthroughout the implementation of the Project. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  any  land  which  might  be  selected  for  the \nupgrading of customs physical infrastructure under this Project will not cause any \ninvoluntary land acquisition, resettlement or limit on access to land as defined in \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n(vii)  The Government will ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, including \nthe prohibition of child labor, and equal pay for men and women for work of equal \nvalue for activities under this Loan. Compliance with these provisions will be \nstrictly monitored during the Loan\u2019s implementation. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that an independent audit will be conducted on the \nproject account and financial statement within 6 months after the close of each \nfiscal year during project implementation. \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  the  establishment  of  a  project  performance \nmanagement system acceptable to ADB within 1 year of loan effectiveness. \n(x)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  the \nestablishment of the PSC, including, at least, representatives from MOF, GDNT, \nMCGA, MIT, ICTA, SSIA, MASM, and MNCCI. \n(xi)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  the  IA  to \nestablish the PMO within the MCGA. \n(xii)  The Government will keep ADB updated on the adoption of the new Customs \nLaw.  \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that all goods and works procured (including without \nlimitation  all  computer  hardware,  software  and  systems  whether  separately \nprocured  or  incorporated  within  other  goods  and  services  procured)  do  not \nviolate or infringe any industrial property of right or claim of any third party. \n ", "19 \n(xiv)  Consistent with ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s commitment to good governance, \naccountability and transparency, the Government will ensure and will cause the \nIA  to  ensure  that  the  Project  funds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to \nimplement the Project and to achieve the Project objectives. The Government will \ncause the IA to (a) undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free  environment;  (b)  ensure  that  the  Government\u2019s  Anticorruption \nLaw and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly \nenforced and are being complied with during Project implementation, and that \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nare included in all bidding documents for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise \nof its right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project; (d) conduct \nperiodic  inspections  on  the  Project  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements; and (e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the IA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The \nBorrower will cooperate with any audit and investigation and extend necessary \nassistance, including access to all relevant books and records, and engagement \nof  independent  auditors  and  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory \ncompletion of such audits and investigations. All external costs related to the \naudits and investigations will be funded from the Loan. \n(xv)  The Government will ensure that all activities at the customs houses, particularly \nhandling, use, storage, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, and \ndisposal of other substances and wastes be conducted in compliance with the \napplicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).51  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n82.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,375,000 to \nMongolia  for  the  Customs  Modernization  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Financing Agreement presented to \nthe Board; and \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to \nthe  Government  of  Mongolia  for  the  Customs  Modernization  Project  to  be \nprovided by the Government of the Republic of Korea. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n      President \n28 November 2006 \n                                                 \n51  ADB. 2002.

The Mongolian Customs General Administration (MCGA) is committed to automating \ncustoms processing and clearance systems with the aim of instituting proper and effective \ncustoms control systems balanced by equal attention to trade facilitation. MCGA also seeks to \nimprove  the  effective  and  efficient  collection  of  revenue,  provide  accurate  statistics  and \ninformation on trade (to assist in the development of economic strategies and policies), and \ndevelop simplified customs procedures in line with international best practices.  \n \n2.  Legal  Framework.    Mongolia\u2019s  accession  to  the  International  Convention  on  the \nSimplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Revised Kyoto Convention) means \nthe Customs Law of Mongolia will have to be revised to incorporate the key provisions of the \nConvention. Several of the Revised Kyoto Convention procedures and standards have already \nbeen adopted by MCGA. For example, MCGA allows pre-clearance facilities for goods that are \nnormally  fragile  or  perishable  (and  therefore  require  special  storage  facilities)  based  on \ndocuments submitted.  \n \n3.  The strategies to be adopted by MCGA include:  \n \n(i)  implementing the revised Customs Law of Mongolia; \n(ii)  streamlining customs procedures; \n(iii)   simplifying and harmonizing customs procedures in line with the Revised Kyoto \nConvention,  including  (a)  maximizing  use  of  information  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT),  (b)  promoting  use  of  risk  management  techniques, \n(c) promoting  partnerships  between  MCGA  and  the  trading  sector,  and \n(d) providing for appeals in all customs-related matters. \n \n4.  Effectiveness of the Customs Automated Data Processing System. From 1996 to \n2002, the MCGA used the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) developed by the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development. As MCGA required modifications to the \nsystem to meet its needs and this could not have been done without incurring tremendous \ncosts,  the MCGA  embarked  on its  own  proprietary  computer-based  software  system.  This \nresulted  in  the  customs  automated  data  processing  system  (GAMAS)  which  replaced \nASYCUDA.  As  a  stand-alone  system  serving  only  the  needs  of  the  MCGA,  the  GAMAS \nprovides a means to capture data that builds on the physical format of the customs merchandise \ndeclaration (CMD).1   \n \n5.  GAMAS can sort and tabulate data, and determine the accuracy of computation. It can \nbe accessed using the internet and thus provide \u201creal-time\u201d information to customs offices \nthrough optic fiber lines or via satellite in remote regions. \n \n6.  GAMAS is also programmed to allocate officers to different customs offices on a weekly \nbasis.  It  can  also  select  the  officer  to  carry  out  an  examination  of  cargoes  presented  for \nclearance. This feature is meant to inject a sense of neutrality into the selection of an examining \nofficer. It is a form of control designed to prevent familiarity between the importer or exporter or \nthe customs broker. It can also be used to monitor the performance of staff. \n \n                                                 \n1  The CMD is a set of four copies of fan-fold document which is used for submission of the Customs declaration of \ngoods. The UN Lay-Out Key (UNLK) for Customs trade declaration is adopted with provision for entry of 54 data \nelements. \n ", " 24  Appendix 2 \n7.  However, GAMAS has not evolved into an electronic trade documentation system that \nallows electronic processing and clearance. Although CMD data are transmitted to MCGA, \ntraders are required to submit manual CMDs which are processed with the required official \nstamps and signatures. Furthermore, GAMAS was written in Visual Basic, a programming \nlanguage, and is designed to run in an SQL (structured query language) environment.  GAMAS \nserved as a tool for assessing and organizing databases. However, Visual Basic and SQL have \nbeen overtaken by more advanced programming languages. GAMAS in its present form has \noutlived its usefulness, especially as it does not support the single electronic window (SEW) \nconcept. \n \n8.  The government of Mongolia has prioritized the development of and maximum use of \ninformation  and  communications  technology  (ICT).  In  2001,  a  national  seminar  on \n\u201cDevelopment of Mongolian ICT\u201d was followed by the establishment of a National Committee for \nICT, headed by the Prime Minister. The Information Communications Technology Authority \n(ICTA) is responsible for policies, development and promotion of ICT. An ICT master plan \nprovides for the establishment of \u201ce-Mongolia\u201d (e.g., e-government, e-customs, e-commerce, e-\neducation). All government ministries and agencies will eventually be linked and will be able to \nprovide one-stop services. MCGA and its counterpart, the General Department of National \nTaxation (GDNT), the two major revenue collecting departments, are in the forefront of the \ngovernment\u2019s modernization plans. \n \n9.  The  reengineering  of  GAMAS  so  it  can  operate  in  a  single  electronic  window \nenvironment is a critical component in the modernization of MCGA. A single window, one-stop \nand synchronized processing and clearance system will reduce business costs, increase time \nsavings, and reduce corrupt practices. The new GAMAS will be a centralized system serving the \ncustoms community (including traders and customs offices and posts). Using such tools as data \nmining  and  data  warehousing,  the  MCGA  will  also  be  able  to  build  up  a  comprehensive \ndatabase. With the support of analytical software, MCGA will be able to create risk management \nprofiles and conduct post-clearance audits more effectively.   \n \n10.  MCGA\u2019s strategy in creating an improved and effective GAMAS includes the following: \n \n(i)  reengineering of GAMAS so it can serve as a unified automated information \nsystem and a single electronic window for processing trade documentation and \nelectronic clearances; \n(ii)  adopting international best practices using international standards of messaging \nand the data model of the World Customs Organization (WCO); \n(iii)   prioritizing the use of risk management techniques and post clearance audits \nagainst a 100% physical inspection, and development of an inventory system for \nthe control of goods in Customs-bonded and licensed premises; \n(iv)  ensuring the participation of other border control agencies (through dialogue and \nmeetings) in the development of a single administrative document and a one-\nstop clearance system; and \n(v)  putting in place change management programs to prepare customs officials, the \ntrading community, and other government agencies for the new processing and \nclearance  system  (redeployment  should  ward  off  fears  of  redundancy  for \nofficials).   \n \n11.  Inadequate  Customs  Physical  Infrastructure.  Customs  infrastructure  at  regional \noffices and border posts varies significantly and depends on the volume of trade within the \nregion. The border posts are normally located near the border towns of Mongolia\u2019s two major \n ", "Appendix 2       25   \n          \ntrading partners, the PRC and the Russian Federation. MCGA has already made preparations \nto  upgrade  major  regional  offices  and  border  posts.  The  border  posts  are  provided  with \ntechnical aids and equipment (such as X-ray machines) to support the MCGA\u2019s mission to \nefficiently and effectively collect revenue, and prevent entry/exit of illegal contraband.    \n \n12.  The review and upgrade of border posts will be concentrated at border crossings where \nthere is a high volume of trade and where trade is expected to grow, in particular where mining \nactivities are expected. The main problem of the major border posts is that passenger clearance \nis not separated from cargo clearance. This is aggravated by the fact that other members of the \ntrading community, such as the customs brokers and banks, are also housed in the same \npremises. There is no dedicated cargo clearance checkpoint. Technical equipment and aids are \neither not available or are installed where they are seldom used.  \n \n13.  Apart from the proper housing and location of the technical aids and equipment, border \nposts also lack utilities and energy supplies. The container inspection complex (CIC) at the \nborder point of Zamyn-Uud2 is often off-line and not working because of the unstable supply of \nelectricity, which causes delays in clearance and longer waiting time for haulers.   \n \n14.  Mongolia has a wide open border with its two big neighbors. Therefore, the request for \nsophisticated equipment and permanent fixed structures needs to be weighed against the ease \nwith  which  smugglers  can  create  their  own  entry  points.  Recurrent  operating  costs  of  \nequipment also need to be taken into consideration before they are purchased. Hand-held, \nmobile, and cheaper equipment should be given preference. For example, mobile equipment is \navailable  and  cheaper  than  the  station-type  equipment  for  radiation  detection.  The  same \narguments can also be made with respect to customs laboratories.  \n \n15.  Customs  Control  of  Goods  Imported  By  Mongolian  Citizens  Living  Near  the \nBorder. The possible loss of revenue through so-called \u201cant trafficking\u201d by residents at border \ntowns (buying goods from the PRC or the Russian Federation and then disposing of them in the \nMongolian  market)  can  be  controlled  by  monitoring  travelers  crossing  and  re-entering  the \nborder. A traveler management system can be used to capture data on travelers\u2019 visits to \nneighboring countries.  \n \n16.  Inter-Agency Coordination. The active participation and support of all the agencies in \nproducing a single administrative document is vital to trade facilitation. Delays are inevitable if \nagencies are left outside the single electronic window clearance. Inter-agency coordination \nshould  include  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MIT),  the  Mongolian  Agency  for \nStandardization and Metrology (MASM), and the State Specialized Inspection Agency (SSIA) \nand should include exchange of information, trade facilitation, and use of Harmonized System \n(HS) codes. \n \n17.  Regional  Cooperation.  MCGA  will  continue  to  participate  in  regional  customs \ncooperation, in particular the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. It \nwill work to improve bilateral ties with its two neighbors and is currently involved in consultative \nmeetings  on  border  crossings  with  them,  which  may  cover  mutual  assistance  to  target \ncontraband and smugglers crossing the border. World Customs Organization (WCO) regional \nintelligence liaison offices (RILO) are a major source of information covering the entire area of \ncustoms  offences.  Mongolia  is  a  member  of  RILO  (Asia/Pacific)  whereas  the  Russian \nFederation is part of RILO (Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS]). \n                                                 \n2  Constructed and installed with a grant from the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n ", " 26  Appendix 2 \n \n18.  Conclusion. The development of the private sector in Mongolia and the potential for the \ncountry  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  depends  to  some  extent  on  efficient, \ntransparent, consistent, and predictable customs procedures and processes. MCGA has taken \nan active stand in declaring to the business community that it intends to become an efficient and \neffective organization and that it is willing to work with the private sector to resolve obstacles \nhindering trade. MCGA\u2019s efforts to modernize customs and to develop GAMAS so that there is a \nsingle electronic window for trade documentation are a step in the right direction. Mongolia was \none of the first countries in the Asia and Pacific region to computerize its customs services and \nMCGA is now seeking to keep abreast of modern global practices. MCGA\u2019s commitment to this \nprogram is reflected in its plan to complete the Project within 3 years.    \n \n19.  The Government has put in place legislation to establish free trade zones (FTZ) to \nfurther promote FDI and the private sector. Although four zones have been designated, none is \noperational or even under construction. If the FTZs are established, MCGA\u2019s computerized \nsystem will enable it to monitor and control goods entering and leaving the FTZs.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3      27   \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Development  \n \n1.  Mongolia's economy is mainly based on mining and agriculture. Mongolia's key mining \nproducts are copper, gold, coal, and petroleum. These are supplemented by smaller industries \nin molybdenum, tungsten, and phosphate mining. Cashmere is a major export product and \nMongolia provides 20% of the global market. As it lacks an adequate cashmere processing \nsector, Mongolia exports raw cashmere to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for processing \nand re-imports the output to produce ready-made garments. Mongolia has been successful in \ntransforming a centrally planned economy into a market-oriented one. It is estimated that 75% \nof the economy is in private ownership. Nearly 1 million people (about 40% of the total) live \naround  the  capital  city  of  Ulaanbaatar,  where  there  are  also  over  30,000  independent \nbusinesses. Most people outside the urban areas are engaged in herding of cows, sheep, \ngoats, horses and Bactrian camels. \n \n2.   The gross domestic product (GDP) of Mongolia grew by 6.2% in 2005, following a surge \nin 2004 (10.6%). The biggest contribution to GDP growth in 2005 was made by the service \nsector, bolstered by increased tourism and transit trade. High global prices for copper and gold \nand foreign direct investment continued to boost the mining industry. For 2006\u20132010, annual \nGDP growth is forecast to average 5%, with significant contributions from mining. Mongolia \nrecognizes the significance of further expanding tourism and the transit trade, given that the \ncurrent narrowly based economy is vulnerable to weather-related natural disasters and declines \nin commodity prices.   \n \n3.  Mongolia is landlocked between two economic giants, the PRC in the south (with a \n4,500 km border) and the Russian Federation in the north (with a 3,050 km border). The PRC \n(45% of Mongolia\u2019s total export value), the United States (25%) and the Russian Federation \n(9%) are Mongolia\u2019s major trading partners. However, the Russian Federation is the major \nexporter to Mongolia (33% of total imports) followed by the PRC (24%).1 Mongolia\u2019s major \nimports are petroleum products followed by foodstuffs.   \n \n4.   Mongolia  provides  a  link  for  the  transit  trade  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian \nFederation. However, the transport infrastructure remains a concern, with only one rail line \nconnecting the north and south and less than 1,400 kms of paved road. ADB is financing a \nnational highway that links the Russian Federation to the PRC via Ulaanbaatar and is due for \ncompletion in 2009.   \n \n5.   Mining contributes more that 50% of the export trade. The discovery of large deposits of \ncopper in Umnugobi  province bordering the PRC is expected to result in an increase of mining \nand related activities in the area.      \n \nB.  Customs Administration  \n \n6.   The  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration  (MCGA)  is  a  major  collector  of \ngovernment revenue through the assessment and collection of import and export duties, excise \ntaxes, and value-added taxes. The MCGA is an integral part of the Ministry of Finance.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Based  on  the  Mongolian  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MIT)  statistics  posted  on  the  MIT  website  at \nhttp://mit.mit.pmis.gov.mn/ \n ", " 28  Appendix 3 \n7.   Legal Framework. MCGA derives its powers from the Customs Law of Mongolia2 which \nsets down the obligations of the customs, transport carriers, importers and exporters. It also \ncontains provisions on, for example, importation for home use, the use of customs facilities such \nas  customs  bonded  warehouses,  types  of  violations  and  penalties,  and  the  search  and \nexamination powers of customs officials. The Customs Law has an enabling article which \ndelegates  authority  to  the  MCGA  to  establish  regulations  pertaining  to  customs  clearance \nprocedures. \n \n8.   In addition, MCGA relies on the Customs Tariff Law of Mongolia, which provides the \nbasis for the creation of the customs tariff, the adoption and modification of customs duty rates, \nthe collection of customs duties, and the principles for the basis of valuation for the computation \nof customs duty.   \n \n9.   The MCGA customs tariff nomenclature is based on the Harmonized Commodity and \nCoding System, commonly known as the Harmonized System (HS) developed by the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO). Mongolia has been a member of the WCO since 1991. The tariff \nnomenclature contains descriptions in three languages, Mongolian, Russian and English. The \nrate of tariff is contained in a single column against each line item description. Most imports are \nsubjected to an ad valorem rate of 5%.  \n \n10.  MCGA also exercises control over excise taxes provided under the Excise Tax Law of \nMongolia. Excise tax is levied on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and tobacco products, motor \nvehicles  (passenger  cars),  and  petroleum  (motor  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel).  Excise  tax  is \napplicable  to  both  locally-manufactured  and  imported  goods.  Gasoline  surcharges  vary \naccording to the octane level. \n \n11.  Under the provisions of the Value Added Tax Law of Mongolia (which came into force on \n1 July 1998), MCGA is vested with the powers to impose and collect value added tax (VAT) on \nall imported goods brought into the country for consumption and use in the country.  The current \nrate of VAT is 10%.3   \n \n12.  Customs Control. MCGA has prioritized the modernization of the organization and the \nsimplification and harmonization of customs processes and procedures. The approaches taken \nby MCGA to simplify customs control and to support trade facilitation include the following. \n \n(i)  Mongolia deposited its instrument of accession to the International Convention \non the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (as amended), \ncommonly known as the Revised Kyoto Convention, on 1 July 2006. This recent \nmove  demonstrates  MCGA\u2019s  confidence  and  its  assurance  that  Mongolia\u2019s \nCustoms practices and procedures are transparent and in step with international \nbest practices. A key element was the provision for the use of risk management \nfor  the  clearance  of  cargo  and  includes  provision  for  the  greater  use  of \nautomation. \n \n(ii)  MCGA has prepared revisions to the Customs Law of Mongolia and the Customs \nTariff  Law.  The  draft  laws  are  expected  to  be  passed  in  the  next  sitting  of \nParliament and before the end of 2006. Key elements of the Revised Kyoto \n                                                 \n2 The Customs Law was adopted on 16 May 1996 and entered into force on 1 July 1996;  several amendments have \nbeen made to the Customs Law, most recently in March 2003. \n3 Reduced from 15% by a decision of the Parliament in July 2006. \n ", "Appendix 3      29   \nConvention  including  the  use  of  risk  management,  greater  utilization  of \nautomation and ICT, and provision for appeals against Customs decisions are \nincluded in the revised Law. In order to meet its World Trade Organization (WTO) \nobligations, MCGA has included the use of transaction value (TV) as the basis \nfor valuing customs duties. There are also provisions for the rules of origin to \ndetermine the country of origin of imports.4   \n \n(iii)  MCGA is using specialized equipment to cater for faster cargo clearance. Close \nto the Zamyn-Uud border post is a container inspection complex complete with \ncomputer systems and X-ray machinery. This complex was constructed by the \nPRC at a cost of $3 million. Container trucks and cargo trucks loaded with goods \nare escorted to this inspection site. Clearance takes about 3 to 5 minutes and \nimages of the screening are captured and attached to cargo declarations. The \nscreening report also is used to determine the extent of examination by customs \nofficers when the containers are presented at the integrated clearance offices \n(ICOs).   \n \n(iv)  MCGA  recognizes  the  inadequacy  of  its  regional  offices  and  border  posts, \nespecially where trade volume is high or expected to grow because of anticipated \nincreases in mining. The poor layout of offices and posts is delaying clearance \nand MCGA has drawn up plans to rehabilitate them. \n \n(v)  Private\u2013public  partnership  (PPP)  is  encouraged  and  practiced  by  MCGA \nmanagement. Regular dialogue, forums and seminars take place with the trading \ncommunity and national trade associations.  \n \n13.  Revenue Collection.  As the second largest collector of government revenue, MCGA \nderives revenue from import and export duties, excise tax, VAT, and fees for provision of \nservices. From 2001 to 2005, customs revenue has increased by a compound annual rate of \n20%. MCGA customs revenue averages 36% of total government revenue. In 2003, MCGA \nrevenue collection was $166.5 million, in 2004 it was $214.8 million, and in 2005 it was $240.8 \nmillion.  The efficient collection of revenue is critical to the national economy, poverty reduction, \nand other social programs.  \n \n14.  Information and Communications Technology.  MCGA has been pushing for greater \nuse of automation and ICT so it can improve its services to the trading community.  Beginning in \n1996, with the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) system, provided free by the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, MCGA embarked on computerization of \ncustoms  declarations.  In  2002,  MCGA  replaced  the  ASYCUDA  system  with  the  customs \nautomated data processing system (GAMAS). This system was developed by national experts \nand  operates  in  a  Microsoft  Windows  environment.    It  was  written  in  Visual  Basic,  a \nprogramming  language,  and  is  designed  to  run  in  an  SQL  (structured  query  language) \nenvironment. GAMAS is largely a data management system. The system was upgraded so it \ncan operate under an internet environment with several application systems being installed to \ncapture data and provide a basis for risk management and post-clearance audit.   \n \n15.  GAMAS was useful in its early years but it has failed to provide an avenue to an \nelectronic trade documentation system linking all parties concerned, such as traders, controlling \n                                                 \n4  Provisions for the rules of origin include products that have undergone substantial transformation and where \nproduction has taken place in two or more countries. \n ", " 30  Appendix 3 \nagencies responsible for clearance of controlled goods, banks, freight forwarders, logistics \noperators, and customs brokers. The manual processing of customs declarations continues to \nthis day. Although customs brokers and traders are able to transmit declaration data to customs, \nthere is no provision for electronic clearance. Data are received through GAMAS and largely \nvalidated for accuracy and acceptance of values (and the computation of taxes due). Approved \ndeclarations  are  provided  with  a  bar-code  by  GAMAS  and  this  is  printed  on  the  manual \nsubmission of the declaration. Using the manual declaration, the trader proceeds to the banks to \nmake payment of taxes. There is no immediate electronic payment through the banks. A major \nbenefit of GAMAS was that it eliminated the MCGA requirement to re-enter data from the \ndeclarations. \n \n16.  MCGA  is  committed  to  moving  toward  a  fully  automated  customs  processing  and \nclearance system, a goal that the Government of Mongolia considers vital to the national \ninterest. The single electronic window concept for MGCA is in line with the Government\u2019s overall \nnational ICT master plan. The reengineering of GAMAS will provide MCGA with an internet-\nenabled and centralized database environment. It will enable data warehousing and data mining \nfor  analysis  to  support  risk  management  and  post-clearance  audit,  improve  links  to  other \ngovernment agencies and foreign organizations, and eventually form a one-stop processing and \nclearance system.   \n \n17.  Regional  Customs  Cooperation.  Mongolia  has  observer  status  at  the  Shanghai \nCooperation Organization (SCO), which is increasingly focusing on economic cooperation. It \nalso has a strategic location between the PRC and the Russian Federation and the broader \nNortheast and Central Asia region.  \n \n18.  Mongolia is a participating country in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Program established by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1997. The other \nparticipating  countries  are  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  PRC,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \n19.  MCGA  participates  in  the  Regional  Trade  Facilitation  and  Customs  Cooperation \nProgram (RTFCCP),5 which comes under the umbrella of CAREC. RTFCCP addresses two \nobjectives: \u201c(i) promoting concerted customs reforms and modernization, and serving as a \nregional forum to address issues of common interest; and (ii) supporting an integrated trade \nfacilitation approach through interagency cooperation and partnership with the private sector as \na long term objective\u201d. The Program provides MCGA with a forum to pursue bilateral initiatives, \none  of  which  was  the  Agreements  on  Mutual  Administrative  Assistance  and  Customs \nCooperation signed with the Kyrgyz Republic in March 2004.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  RTFCCP is coordinated by the Customs Coordination Committee (CCC), consisting of the heads of the customs \nadministration of the CAREC countries.  \n ", "Appendix 4      31   \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO MONGOLIAN CUSTOMS \n       \nSource   Major Area of Assistance  Modality of Assistance  Status \nADB   \u2022  Regional trade facilitation and  \u2022  Assessment and  Needs \ncustoms cooperation under the  diagnosis studies  assessment \nCAREC Program  \u2022  Senior customs officials\u2019  completed in \n\u2022  Needs assessment on trade  meeting under CCC   2005;

No  \u2327 \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nThe Project is a continuation of support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for customs reform and \nmodernization for Mongolia under the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program of the Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \ntransparency of customs services, thereby contributing to enhancing the enabling environment for transit and \ninternational  trade,  foreign  direct  investment,  and  economic  growth.  The  poor  will  benefit  from  employment \nopportunities generated from enhanced trade, foreign direct investment, and economic growth.  \n \nThe Project is expected to reduce transaction costs for trade in two ways: (i) efficiency gains through automation of \ncustoms services and improved border clearance facilities, and (ii) reductions in corruption by minimizing direct \ninterfaces between customs officers and traders and their representatives. Reduced transaction costs make trade in \nsmall  volumes  possible  and  therefore  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  small  traders.  Improved  efficiency  and \ngovernance  will  enhance  revenue  collection  by  customs  services  departments.  This  revenue  represents  a \nsignificant percentage of the state budget. Adequate revenue collection is the key for sound fiscal management for \npoverty reduction and sustainable economic development. The poor will benefit from better provision of social \nservices from the government budget. More public investment in education, health, and other infrastructure is the \nway to reduce non-income-related poverty.  \n \nPoor people in disadvantaged areas, for instance in Western Mongolia, will benefit from smooth trade between the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation. Transit trade between the Russian Federation \nthrough Tsagaannuur border point and the PRC through Yarant border point is expected to increase. The project \nwill complement ADB\u2019s Western Road Development Project, which is scheduled to start implementation in 2007 or \n2008. Development of service industries along the transit routes, including the Western Road Corridor, will thus be \nencouraged. In the long run, improved customs procedures will make a positive contribution to the development of \nMongolia as a transit trade hub.  \n \nThe Project is expected to contribute positively toward the Government\u2019s fight against corruption and to reduce \nGovernment bureaucracy. The Government considers the lack of customs modernization as a major bottleneck to \npromoting a business-friendly environment. Activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are expected to \nbe encouraged, which will help reduce income related poverty.  \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                                           Poverty Classification: General Intervention \n \nMongolia has made significant progress in promoting parliamentary democracy and a market-oriented economy \nsince 1991. The transition has been very rapid compared with those in other former socialist countries. Economic \ngrowth has been moderate, averaging 5-6% a year over the last few years with a peak of 10.6% in 2004. \nMacroeconomic stability has been impressive and Mongolia has been pursuing reforms to the former centrally-\nplanned economy.  \n \nHowever poverty is widespread. The poverty incidence is lower in urban (30%) than in rural areas (43.0%). In \nUlaanbaatar, one third of the population is poor. The total population of Mongolia reached 2.5 million in 2004, of \nwhich 1.5 million are of working age, about 1.0 million constitute the labor force. The number of registered \nunemployed was 35,600 at the end of 2004, an official unemployment rate of 3.4%. \n \nThere is a general consensus on the causes and determinants of poverty in the Mongolia. The emergence of high \nlevels of poverty can be traced to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in \nproduction. This in turn led to rapidly increasing unemployment at a time when the state\u2019s capacity to respond was \nimpaired by the loss of budgetary support and a sharp reduction in the revenue base. Continuing high levels of \npoverty are largely due to the reform of state institutions and the restructuring of society and the economy according \nto market rules and mechanisms. In particular there are (i) difficulties in creating and sustaining opportunities for \ngainful employment on a substantial scale; (ii) problems relating to external and domestic markets for Mongolian-\n ", "Appendix 10      43   \nmade products, reflecting the landlocked nature of country, its trade and transit problems, and the small domestic \nmarket; (iii) the limited capacity of the state to address essential social needs because of fiscal constraints; and \n(iv) continuing corruption and inefficiency in the instruments of state governance that inhibit private enterprise and \nlegitimate entrepreneurial activity.  \n \nSevere winters during 2001\u20132003 also contributed to high poverty rates in Mongolia. In addition, the ending of the \nmulti-fiber  agreement  in  2004  meant  that  garment  production  decreased  compared  with  2003,  leaving \napproximately 5,000 workers unemployed at the end of 2004. Foreign investors left Mongolia. Non-income-related \npoverty indicators such as the unavailability of access to education, health, information, and technologies have kept \npoverty rates high. The outdated education system has restricted workers\u2019 ability to compete in more sophisticated \njob markets.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s policies to combat poverty in Mongolia have been reflected in a number of policy papers, such \nas the Government\u2019s Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy and its implementation progress \nreport in 2003, the Government\u2019s resolution No. 54 of 2006 on the Government\u2019s priorities, the Government Action \nPlan for 2004-2008, and the \u201ce-Mongolia\u201d program. The Government aims to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoal of halving the proportion of citizens with an income below the minimum subsistence level by 2015 compared \nwith the base level in 1990.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s policy is to reduce poverty through economic growth based on macroeconomic stability. In the \nmedium term, the Government will implement policies aimed at accelerating private-sector-led economic growth by \nstabilizing the economy, achieving low and stable inflation, and developing free market competition as well as \nappropriate monetary, credit and tax policies. The Government also realizes that fighting against corruption and \nGovernment bureaucracy will also help reduce poverty. \n \nThe Project supports the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategies. It will provide investment and assistance to (i) \nstrengthen governance and transparency, and improve institutional capability in customs services to improve the \nenabling environment for market-oriented and private-sector-led economic development; (ii) improve operational \nefficiency to facilitate trade and improve revenue collection, which will help ensure adequate provision of social \nservices; and (iii) provide a technical platform for furthering regional cooperation in customs service, which will in the \nlonger-term stimulate trade and economic growth, benefiting the poor and non-poor in the whole region. \n \nThere will be no negative effects on any population groups, including indigenous people.  \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  Yes    No   \n \nExtensive consultations were undertaken during project preparation with various stakeholders. These included the \nline ministries such as the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and trade-related government agencies such as the Mongolian \nAgency of Standardization and Methodology (MASM), the State Specialized Inspection Agency (SSIA), and the \nMongolian  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (MNCCI).  Transport  organizations,  private  sector \nrepresentatives, international organizations and/or agencies, local personnel at the borders and local authorities \nwere also consulted. Consultations were undertaken in relation to operational procedures and border development.  \n \nIs there a Participation Strategy?               Yes (cid:134)           No  \u2327 \n \nD.
