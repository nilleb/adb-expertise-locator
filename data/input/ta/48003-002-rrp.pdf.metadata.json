THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Qingdao Smart Low-Carbon District Energy \nProject.1  \n \n2.  The project will develop and demonstrate a low-carbon, energy-efficient district heating, \ncooling, and power production and distribution system in eight locations in Qingdao City. Instead \nof coal, the system will use natural gas, solar thermal, shallow-ground geothermal, and waste \nheat recovered from industrial plants as its energy sources.2 The project will also demonstrate a \nlow-temperature  district  energy  distribution  network  and  combine  it  with  a  smart  energy \nmanagement system.3 The project system is expected to lower energy intensity by 40% and \ncarbon intensity by 64% from the averages achieved by comparable standard systems now in \nuse in the northern PRC.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Qingdao  is  in  Shandong  Province  in  the  northeast  of  the  PRC  where  winter \ntemperatures drop to as low as \u201317 degrees Celsius (oC) and are typically below zero for 5 \nmonths a year. Heating is therefore an essential service for public health and well-being and \nsustaining people\u2019s livelihoods. Demand for heating grew along with urbanization at an average \nrate of 11% a year during 2011\u20132014 in Qingdao. The city air has become hazy and polluted in \nthe winter, a problem common in the PRC\u2019s urban regions. According to the local air quality \nmonitoring system, the average annual fine particulate matter concentration in 2014 was 84 \nmicrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), more than 8 times the level recommended by the World \nHealth Organization.5 It is estimated that on winter days 40% of this particulate matter comes \nfrom burning coal.  \n \n4.  Coal-based heating is a major cause of rising levels of outdoor and indoor air pollution \nduring the winter months and the growing risk of respiratory and heart diseases that results. The \nsick, children, the elderly, and the poor are affected the most. In June 2013, the Government of \nthe PRC issued a policy on 10 air pollution prevention and control measures, which included the \nreduction of coal use and greater use of natural gas and renewable energy. In July 2013, the \nQingdao municipal government (QMG) developed a comprehensive policy for urban air pollution \nreduction, which included a ban on the use of coal in district energy systems for new and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Shallow-ground geothermal technology uses the earth as a heat source in the winter and a heat sink in the \nsummer for heating and cooling systems. The project will use waste heat recovered from both industrial plants and \nmunicipal sewage plants. \n3  Instead of keeping the prevailing flow temperature of water at 75 degree Celsius (oC) and return temperature of \nwater at 55oC in the distribution network for heat, the project will employ current best practice of flow temperature \nof water at 50oC and return temperature of water at 40oC in the network, which is extensively used in many \nEuropean countries. The smart energy management system will optimize energy supply by responding to real-time \ndemand. \n4  Compared with the average energy intensity of 0.56 gigajoules per square meter (m2) in the PRC, the project will \nachieve 0.35 gigajoules per m2. Compared with the 70 kilograms of carbon emissions per m2 produced by coal-\nbased systems, the project system will produce 20 kilograms per m2. \n5  In 2014, the average concentration of fine particles (of less than 2.5 micrometers) in some large PRC cities, which \nhave drawn much national and international attention, was 95 \u03bcg/m3 in Hebei, 86 \u03bcg/m3 in Beijing, and 83 \u03bcg/m3 in \nTianjin. Air pollution in Qingdao is equally severe. In contrast, the average concentration is 22 \u00b5g/m3 in Metro \nManila in the Philippines and 10 \u00b5g/m3 in Yokohama in Japan. ", "2 \nadditional heating areas, and a plan to eliminate the use of coal over time in urban areas. In \nJanuary 2014, the PRC set new targets for provinces to reduce air pollution by 5%\u201325% during \n2015\u20132020.  The  United  Kingdom,  where  smog  rose  to  serious  levels  in  London  in  1952, \nshowed that a rapid switch from the use of coal to gas as a basic energy fuel can greatly reduce \nair pollution.6 \n \n5.  Qingdao was selected as pilot city for low-carbon development by the government\u2019s \nNational Development and Reform Commission in December 2012. One-third of carbon dioxide \nemissions in the city come from residences and the heating industry, many of which still use \ncoal-based systems and high-loss heating networks.7 This makes the replacement of boilers \nand centralized district heating networks using coal with decentralized systems using natural \ngas and renewable sources a high priority of Qingdao in the effort to reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions.8 \n \n6.  The district heating systems in the PRC also tend to overheat buildings, which leads to \nsignificant energy loss through the building envelope. This happens because heat suppliers do \nnot know and cannot react to the customer demand for heat in real time. Use of a smart energy \nmanagement system will prevent overheating, save energy, and improve the quality of heating \nservice. These systems provide interactive communications and energy control between heat \nsuppliers and customers to indicate and meet household demand. \n \n7.  The project design (para. 2) responds directly to the urgent national, provincial, and \nmunicipal government priorities to develop low-carbon cities and reduce urban air pollution \n(paras. 4\u20136). When the project is completed, the design can be replicated in other major cities to \nbring  their  systems  in  line  with  current  international  best  practices  for  achieving  energy \nefficiency.9 By providing cleaner district energy services and improving air quality, the project \nwill directly benefit about half a million people in the project area, or about 15% of the city\u2019s \nurban population, as well as commercial enterprises and public agencies. It will indirectly benefit \nthe residents of the other parts of Qingdao by removing some of the sources of pollution now \nemanating from the project area. \n \n8.  While preparing the project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established a platform \nfor  an  exchange  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  between  the  Qingdao  District  Heating \nAssociation and the Swedish Council for District Heating and District Cooling, an international \nleader  in  the  development  of  low-carbon  and  energy-efficient  district  heating  and  cooling \nsystems. This will help Qingdao gain knowledge of (i) district energy policies and regulations, (ii) \ndistrict energy technologies and new applications, and (iii) lessons learned in other relevant \nprojects beyond the PRC.10 In addition, to disseminate knowledge and experience gained from \n                                                \n6  The  World  Bank  recommends  that  natural  gas  be  used  for  heating  rather  than  coal. World  Bank.  2007. \nEnvironmental Health and Safety Guidelines. Washington, DC. This is because it emits 50% less carbon dioxide, \n82% less nitrogen oxide, negligible particulate matters, and 98% less sulfur dioxide. A heating source using natural \ngas can be operated independently and located within the building being heated (distributed energy). \n7  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Enabling the Protection of Jiaozhou Bay \nWater Quality. Manila. \n8  A decentralized or distributed energy system can reduce the amount of energy lost in transmitting heat and/or \npower from where they are generated to where they are to be used because the source is within the same building \nor nearby. In addition, upgrading and/or expanding current heating pipelines to meet demand is difficult when the \nunderground space for service infrastructure is already congested.  \n9  It can be replicated in 180 cities in 14 provinces and  2 autonomous regions and in the municipalities of Beijing and \nTianjin where heating is provided by a district system. \n10 ADB facilitated the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Swedish Council for District Heating \nand District Cooling and the Qingdao District Heating Association on 29 May 2015. \n ", "3 \nthe  Qingdao  project,  ADB  will  support  district  energy  conference  in  the  PRC  and  publish \nknowledge products and policy notes. \n \n9.  The project is closely aligned with (i) the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,11 which \nidentifies  environmentally  sustainable  growth  as  a  priority  for  helping  developing  member \ncountries move to a low-carbon growth path by improving energy efficiency and introducing \nrenewable energy; (ii) ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC,12 which \nidentifies environmental sustainability as one of the three pillars of ADB assistance; and (iii) \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy,13 which prioritizes energy efficiency, renewable energy development, and \naccess to energy for all. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The impacts will be (i) greater energy efficiency in district energy systems, and (ii) a \ndecline in cases of respiratory and heart diseases. The outcome will be the avoidance of \nemissions of carbon and pollutants by district energy systems in Qingdao.  \n \nC.  Output \n \n11.  The output will be the construction of a smart, distributed district energy system in \nQingdao.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n19.  Heat source assessment. An assessment of the heat sources available for the project \nestablished the following:  \n \n(i)  Natural gas. The project will consume an estimated 155 million cubic meters of \nnatural gas annually, equivalent to less than 2% of the gas consumed in 2014 in \nQingdao.  A  gas  supply  agreement  has  been  concluded  with  the  Qingdao \nTaineng Gas Company, a 100% subsidiary of QEG. \n(ii)  Solar energy. Qingdao has good solar irradiation of 4,200\u20135,400 megajoules per \nsquare meter annually, which is suitable for solar heating. \n(iii)  Wastewater heat. The temperature of wastewater is 12oC\u201314oC in winter, which \nis within the range of ideal heat source temperatures (above 10oC in winter). \n(iv)  Ground heat. The ground temperature is stable year-round at about 15\u00b0C and is \nwithin the range of ideal heat source temperatures. \n(v)  Waste  heat  recovery  from  industrial  plants.  Available  waste  heat  from \nindustrial plants is estimated at 240 megawatt-thermal equivalent, and a heat \nsupply agreement has been concluded with the source industries. In the event \nthat heat supply from industrial plants is interrupted, natural gas boilers to be \ninstalled under the project will provide backup. \n \n20.  The technical due diligence confirmed that the use of these diverse heat sources is \nviable and that the envisioned project methods have been applied successfully in Germany and \nScandinavian  countries. 17  However,  QEG\u2019s  limited  experience  in  this  technology  poses \nperformance risks. To mitigate these risks, technical consultants engaged under the project and \na local design institute with experience in the technical design of an advanced district energy \n                                                \n17 The applications include (i) combined, natural gas-based cooling, heating, and power; (ii) waste heat recovery from \nindustrial and municipal sewage plants; (iii) underground heat pumps; (iv) absorption heat pumps; and (v) solar \nthermal. \n ", "7 \nsystem  will  help  QEG  in  reviewing  and  optimizing  the  systems\u2019  technical  design  and  in \nsupervising project implementation (para. 19). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The economic benefits of the project will include those provided by a more efficient \nheating system and environmental improvements. An economic analysis considered all the \nproject-related costs, benefits from cost savings from the use of alternative fuels and system \nefficiency improvements, and local and global environmental benefits. The project\u2019s estimated \neconomic internal rate of return was 16.81% without the environmental benefits and 16.98% \nwith  them,  making  the  project  economically  viable  since  both  figures  exceed  the  12.00% \neconomic  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  testing  indicated  that  the  project  would  likely  remain \nsustainable under a variety of adverse economic impacts. \n \n22.  The project will generate revenue from the sale of heat, cooling, electricity, and the \ncollection of the service connection fees from new customers in the project areas. Financial \nanalysis of the project indicated a financial internal rate of return of 10.35%, well above the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.92%. Sensitivity analysis showed the project to be likely \nsustainable under several potential adverse scenarios. A financial performance analysis and \nfinancial  projections  indicated  that  QEG  has  the  financial  capacity  needed  to  provide \ncounterpart funding, service the project debt, and cover operation and maintenance costs. \n  \nC.  Governance \n23.  ADB has assessed the financial management risk of QEG as moderate. This is based \non its limited direct experience in following ADB disbursement procedures, which could delay \ndisbursements.18 To address the risk, QEG and QMG were given disbursement training during \nproject  preparation.  More  training  will  follow  during  implementation,  and  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements are deemed adequate with these mitigation measures. QMG has \nestablished a good track record in financial management while implementing several other \nADB-financed projects.19  \n \n24.  An  assessment  of  QEG  procurement  capacity  showed  it  to  have  the  skilled  and \nexperienced  staff  and  well-established  procedures  and  systems  needed  to  manage \nprocurement  in  a  manner  consistent  with  ADB  requirements.20 Staff  received  procurement \ntraining three times during the project preparation period, and QEG has conducted international \ncompetitive bidding for other projects financed by foreign development partners. QEG engaged \na tendering agency with good experience on 15 June 2015 specifically for this project, and ADB \n                                                \n18 The financial management assessment was conducted under project preparatory technical assistance in May \n2015.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  QMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  Social benefits. The project will directly benefit 420,000 people in the project area, of \nwhom about 210,000 are female and 7,495 are from poor households. It will provide direct \nbenefits to 22,000 children in 15 schools and an additional 7,000 in 55 kindergartens, as well as \npatients and medical staff in 7 hospitals. The project will (i) reduce cases of respiratory diseases \nby improving indoor and outdoor air quality, (ii) reduce carbon monoxide poisoning by providing \nsafer district heating services, (iii) provide a better medical environment by providing cleaner \nand more reliable heating services, (iv) improve living conditions by providing adequate and \nreliable heating services, (v) reduce household spending on heating by shifting consumers from \nthe use of stoves and decentralized heating systems to centralized energy-efficient heating \nsystems, (vi) provide a better learning environment for students during the winter by providing \nschools with cleaner and more reliable heating services, and (vii) increase income through the \ncreation of 350 temporary jobs during construction. \n \n27.  Gender impact. The project\u2019s gender category is some gender elements. Its benefits for \nwomen will include (i) access to a reliable, cleaner, and safer heating system; (ii) an easing of \nthe domestic chores related to space heating (1 hour per day); (iii) a reduced incidence of \nrespiratory diseases related to indoor air pollution; and (iv) a lowering of the current rate of \ncarbon monoxide poisoning and accidental fires. \n \n28.  The project will (i) organize energy conservation-awareness campaigns in partnership \nwith a women\u2019s federation at least twice during implementation, targeting all 100,000 women in \nthe project area (including 11,000 female students); (ii) aim to fill  50% of the 310 permanent \npositions to be created during operation with women employees; (iii) ensure that QMG provides \na 100% subsidy for heating tariffs to poor households headed by women and that heating \ncompanies  waive  their  connection  fees  for  these  households;  and  (iv)  conduct  customer \nsatisfaction surveys in a gender-responsive manner to improve service delivery. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  complied  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements,  including \nthose under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The risks during project construction \nidentified by the IEE included those related to (i) noise and dust, (ii) construction waste, (iii) \ncommunity disturbance and public safety, and (iv) occupational health and safety. It found \npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  during  system  operation  to  be  related  to  (i)  the \nemission of nitrogen oxides, (ii) noise, (iii) the disposal of wastewater from the heat source \nplants, and (iv) occupational health and safety. The IEE concluded that all the construction and \noperational risks it pinpointed could be mitigated by implementing measures specified by the \n                                                \n21 The tendering agency has a grade A certificate as an international tendering agent from the government and \nexperience from five ADB projects and five World Bank projects currently being implemented.  \n ", "9 \nenvironmental  management  plan,  monitoring  implementation,  and  assigning  institutional \nresponsibility for ensuring proper environmental management. \n \n30.  QMG and QEG carried out meaningful consultations with the public in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  QMG  and  QEG  are  committed  to  managing  the \nenvironmental risks cited by the IEE and have agreed on a comprehensive set of environment-\nrelated loan covenants and to participate in a training program that will strongly emphasize \nenvironmental  safeguards.  The  IEE  was  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  3  August  2015. \nEnvironmental  safeguard  documents  were  disclosed  to  the  affected  people.  Potential \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the project. An assessment of the climate change risks posed to the \nproject considered them to be moderate. The most significant threat comes from rising sea \nlevels, and no specific design modifications were required or justified since this will not affect the \nproject during its life span.22 \n \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.    The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project does not entail \npermanent  land  acquisition,  restrictions  on  land  use,  the  demolition  of  any  structure,  or \ninvoluntary resettlement. Installing underground heating pipelines will affect only publicly owned \nroads and sidewalks for a maximum of 6 months. The project is not expected to have adverse \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  It  will  be  implemented  in  a  large  urban  area  where  a  vast \npercentage  of  people  are  members  of  the  Han  ethnic  majority,  and  where  no  significant \ndifferences exist between the lifestyles and socioeconomic status of the Han majority and ethnic \nminorities. The project site is not close to any ethnic minority towns or villages.  \n \n32.  Environmental benefits. The project\u2019s completion will allow QMG to shut down coal-\nfired heating systems. The project system\u2019s natural gas use will generate an estimated annual \ncarbon dioxide emission of 490,000 tons. This will be offset by emission reductions expected \nfrom QMG\u2019s low-carbon and air pollution control program.23 By using natural gas and renewable \nenergy sources, the project system will eliminate the consumption of the 537,867 tons of coal \nthat would occur each year under a business-as-usual scenario. This will prevent the emission \nof 1,398,456 tons of carbon dioxide, 12,909 tons of sulfur dioxide, 3,765 tons of nitrogen oxide, \nand 5,379 tons of particulate matter. Compared with a traditional heating system, the project \nsystem will emit 53% less carbon dioxide, and less than 5% of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, \nand particulate matter.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n                                                \n22 The assessment found that the project\u2019s critical structures are roughly 2\u20134 meters above the current sea level. An \naverage sea level rise of even 1 centimeter a year would result in a sea level only 25 centimeters higher than \ntoday\u2019s by the end of the project design\u2019s estimated 25-year life span. Slow-onset sea level risks can be addressed \nthrough adaptive incremental interventions. \n23 QMG has been implementing other low-carbon and air pollution control measures that include the (i) elimination of \nold vehicles and construction of 10 metro lines to reduce the emissions from road traffic; (ii) development of \nrenewable energy (wind, solar, and hydropower); (iii) enforced installation of desulphurization, denitrification, and \ndust removal facilities in coal-fired power plants and boilers; (iv) elimination of small coal-fired boilers; and (v) \nshutdowns of polluting industries. The progress made through these measures will be monitored during the project \nimplementation.  \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe contract award may be delayed.   ADB provided procurement training to QEG during project preparation \nand will give additional training to both QEG and the tendering company \nduring implementation. \nDisbursement could be slow.   ADB will provide disbursement training to QEG and QMG during project \npreparation and implementation. \nThe project\u2019s district energy system  Technical consultants under the project will assist QEG in reviewing and \nachieves less than anticipated energy  optimizing the technical design and the specifications for the detailed \nefficiency.   design, selecting quality contractors and suppliers, and supervising \nproject implementation to ensure high probability of achieving design \nefficiency levels. \nAsian Development Bank = ADB, QEG = Qingdao Energy Group, QMG = Qingdao municipal government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n34.  Overall, the risks associated with the project have been adequately addressed. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government and QMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n36.  The government and QMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$130,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Qingdao Smart Low-Carbon District \nEnergy  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n16 November 2015 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nEnergy efficiency in district energy systems improved.a  \nCases of respiratory and heart diseases decreased.a  \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome   By 2022     \nCarbon and pollutant  Annual standard coal  Data from the project\u2019s  The project \nemission from district  consumption of more than  annual environmental  system achieves \nenergy system in  537,867 tons avoided.
