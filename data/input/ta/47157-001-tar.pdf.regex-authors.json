INTRODUCTION \n1.  Viet Nam has faced a new set of challenges since graduating to \u201cmiddle-income country\u201d \nstatus  in  2010.  In  a  dynamic  and  fast-changing  environment,  enhancing  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ncompetitiveness requires a diverse range of government interventions. These include creating \nan enabling policy and regulatory environment, and providing adequate physical and social \ninfrastructure. An efficient, effective, and ethical contingent of civil servants is essential for \ndelivering the public goods that are necessary to achieve sustainable growth and meet the \nincreasing demands of the society. In leading the country down this new development path, the \ngovernment should move towards more accountability and results-oriented management. The \nkey  driver  of  change  is  centered  on  a  civil  service  reform  program  since  the  quality  and \nenforcement of government policies rest on the performance and accountability of its civil \nservants.  \n \n2.  The Government of Viet Nam, recognizing its strategic importance, issued the Civil \nService Reform Implementation Plan1 in October 2012 and requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  implement  the  plan.2 In  response  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s request, ADB conducted close consultations with the government agencies to \nprocess  the  proposal,  including  holding  a  fact-finding  mission  in  September  2013.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2012\u20132015 includes advisory TA for supporting civil service \nreform in the 2013 TA program.3 The government concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the \nproposal. Details of  the Design and Monitoring Framework (DMF) are in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Development challenges. At the end of 2012, 500,000 of the estimated 2.3 million civil \nservants were employed by government agencies with the remaining 1.8 million working as \npublic service providers (in schools and health centers, for example). One of the challenges \nconfronting  implementation  of the government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2006\u2013\n2010 is the ineffectiveness of its existing institutions because of capacity constraints, weak \ncapabilities, and inadequate skills. The civil service in Viet Nam is characterized with lifelong \nemployment  and  seniority-based  promotions  that  provide  little  incentive  to  improve \nperformances. The  result  is  an  ineffective  human  resource management  system. The  civil \nservant grades do not necessarily reflect competence. The promotion examinations are generic \nto the grade rather than specific to the competence needed for a job.  \n \n4.  The  government  lacks  systematic  personnel  planning.  Generic  and  unclear  job \ndescriptions make it difficult to recruit the most suitable persons for a staff position. Performance \nevaluations cannot be done effectively because the rater and the staff being rated often do not \nshare a clear and common understanding of the required competences and tasks. Training \nfocuses too much on general theoretical and legal information in large lecture halls. Since \ntraining courses are largely designed to meet the general requirements, the content is not \nrelated to the practicalities of the work environment.  \n \n5.  Government\u2019s strategy and plan. The government has identified institutional reform, \nincluding  transforming  the  civil  service,  as  one  of  the  three  pillars  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment for 2011\u20132020. The Public Administration Reform (PAR) Master Program, 2011\u2013\n                                                \n1  The Civil Service Reform Implementation Plan was issued under Decision 1557 on 18 October 2012. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 April 2013. \n3  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n2020 (Resolution 30 issued on 8 November 2011) calls for the reform of (i) administrative \nprocedures,  (ii)  human  resource  management  (HRM)  to  improve  the  performance  of  civil \nservants and public service employees, and (iii) public financial management. The program \nreorients the annual resource allocation process from input-based to output- or target-based \nbudgeting. The PAR index was introduced on 17 December 2012 to evaluate the operations of \nstate agencies and local authorities. The index will enable the government to monitor, evaluate, \nand rank the results of the public administrative reforms in ministries and provinces based on \nseven criteria, including administrative management and institutional implementation. \n \n6.  The Law on Civil Servants (2010) provides the legal framework for reforming the HRM \nsystem to achieve accountable and results-oriented management. The challenge is to translate \nthe law into HRM policies that are based on the principles of meritocracy. An integrated HRM \nsystem, including human resource planning, recruitment, training, promotion, and performance \nmanagement, needs to be developed.  To that end, a standardized system for job analysis, job \ndescriptions, competency system and performance evaluation needs to be introduced to ensure \neffective human resource management, integrating recruitment of right persons for right jobs, \ncompetence-based  training,  transparent,  fair  performance  assessment  and  promotion.  To \nfacilitate implementation of the reform, a comprehensive Civil Service Reform Implementation \nPlan was issued in October 2012 and a National Steering Committee was set up in November \n2012  under  the  leadership  of  a  deputy  prime  minister.  The  Implementation  Reform  Plan \nidentifies  an  adoption  of  a  standardized  system  for  job  analyses  and  descriptions  with \ncompetency  as  critical  task  and  a  precondition  for  implementing  integrated  HRM.  The \ngovernment issued Decree 36 in April 2013 to legalize and guide the development of such a \nsystem. \n \n7.  Lessons. Under ADB\u2019s TA for Supporting Civil Service Reform, ADB supported the \ndevelopment of Viet Nam\u2019s first Law on Civil Servants.4  That TA showed that the use of job \nanalysis and descriptions with competencies is a paradigm shift for Viet Nam.5 Hence, the \nchallenges in managing the change must not be underestimated. Strong leadership and active \ninvolvement of the job incumbents in the analysis process are necessary. Transparent and fair \nprocedures for the allocation of work, as well as specific duties and responsibilities, need to be \nput in place and communicated widely. To manage the change process, the characteristics of \nViet Nam\u2019s civil service system need to be well understood and the new system must fit the \ncountry context. The need for strong leadership and effective coordination between the Ministry \nof  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  and  other  agencies  in  identifying  and  promoting  champions  for \nchanges is another lesson learned from the previous TA. \n \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be quality of human resource management (HRM) improved in \ngovernment agencies with 70% of government agencies adopting result-oriented HRM with job \ndescriptions, competency frameworks, and performance evaluations by 2020. The outcome will \nbe an integrated HRM system implemented and sustained in government agencies with a \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Supporting Civil Service Reform. Manila. \n5  One of the activities of the TA for Supporting Civil Service Reform (footnote 4) was a small-scale test of using job \nanalysis and job descriptions in some units of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and \nQuang Ninh Province. ", "3 \n \nstandardized  system  for  job  analysis,  job  descriptions,  and  qualification  standards  system \n(competencies framework) applied in at least six government agencies by 2016.6 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will deliver four outputs: (i) a standardized system for job analysis and job \ndescriptions without gender discrimination, (ii) competency frameworks (qualification standards) \nby grades and managerial positions, (iii) guidelines on performance evaluation procedures, and \n(iv) dissemination of lessons learned and good practices for change management. The TA will \nreview experiences of the earlier TA, and develop job analysis and job descriptions in one \nselected ministry and one province as a model for replication in the remaining ministries and \nprovinces.7 \n \n10.  Standardized  system  for  job  analysis  and  job  descriptions  without  gender \ndiscrimination. The TA will scale up the techniques for conducting job analyses and preparing \njob descriptions that were tested under ADB\u2019s TA for Supporting Civil Service Reform (footnote \n4) in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and Quang Ninh province as \na model for replication in other agencies.8 A handbook on how to do job analysis and job \ndescriptions will be developed and approved by MOHA in the first quarter (Q1) of 2015 for \ndissemination. The handbook will also cover gender equality issues and government targets. \nShort training courses will be designed by Q4 2015 and delivered to task forces at MOHA and \ntarget agencies. Coaching and mentoring will facilitate the implementation of functional analysis \nand preparation of job descriptions across departments at the target ministry and the province, \nstarting  from  Q4  2014  until  Q2  2016.  Training-of-trainers  courses  on  methodologies  and \ntechniques for conducting job analysis and preparing job descriptions will also be delivered to at \nleast 300 human resource officials (at least 35% of them women) in ministries and provinces. \nMOHA, with support from the consultant team, will collect feedback, exchange experiences, and \nprovide technical advice to job analysts across agencies, including participants in the training-of-\ntrainers program. An online training course will be designed and posted on MOHA\u2019s website by \nQ2 2015 to facilitate capacity building on a wider scale. A road map on the human resource \ninformation system (HRIS) will also be developed to plan the scope of work needed for the \nbackbone  information  technology  system  supporting  the  reform  of  human  resource \nmanagement. \n \n11.  Competency  frameworks  (qualification  standards)  by  grades  and  managerial \npositions.  The TA  will  support  a  diagnostic  study  and  survey  on the  current qualification \nstandards system and identify areas for improvement by Q4 2014. The study will also analyze \ngender equality issues, related roles and responsibilities in the current competency framework, \nand  ways  to  improve  gender  competencies,  supporting  women\u2019s  entry  and  promotions. \nConsultations will be conducted with male and female staff at national and subnational levels on \nthe  survey  findings,  and  to  share  international  best  practices  and  develop  guidelines  on \ncompetency frameworks by Q4 2015. From this work, the TA will pilot proposed competencies \nin  some  selected  agencies,  including  MONRE  and  the  Quang  Ninh  Provincial  People\u2019s \nCommittee. The pilot in these targeted agencies will take into account gender equality issues. \n                                                \n6 In addition to the implementation at the two targeted pilot agencies supported  directly  under the TA, the \nstandardized methodology and techniques for job analysis, job descriptions, and qualification standards system \n(competencies framework)  will be applied in at least four other agencies. \n7 MONRE is selected as the pilot target ministry and Quang Ninh Province as the pilot province. As a priority, job        \nanalysis and job descriptions will also be conducted in ADB-funded PMUs in these two agencies. \n8 Whereas the previous TA for Supporting Civil Service Reform only supported the testing on a small division-wide \nscale, the new TA will support piloting on a much larger scale, i.e., ministry-wide and province-wide, with a view to \ndeveloping official ministry and/or provincial job descriptions. \n ", "4 \n \nConsultations  and  feedback  will  be  incorporated  to  develop  guidelines  and  competencies \nframeworks by Q4 2015 to replace the current standards. \n \n12.  Guidelines on performance evaluation procedures. The TA will support a diagnostic \nstudy on the current performance management system, including policies, legislation, practices, \nand responsibilities of key stakeholders by Q1 2015 and share international best practices. \nPerformance appraisal procedures will be developed and tested at selected agencies, including \nMONRE and the Quang Ninh Provincial People\u2019s Committee, by Q1 2015. Consultations on the \nlessons learned will help develop guidelines on performance appraisal procedures by Q4 2015. \n \n13.  Dissemination of lessons learned and good practices for change management. \nThe TA will help develop a knowledge management and communication plan by Q4 2014. A \nhandbook on conducting job analysis and preparing job descriptions will be developed by \nMOHA by Q1 2015 for implementation. The handbook will be widely disseminated by Q2 2015 \nand will be applied by the trained HR managers in at least four other agencies. Training courses, \nincluding e-learning modules, will be delivered to human resource managers and civil servants \nthrough workshops, seminars, and MOHA\u2019s website. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.250 million, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of personnel, office accommodation and \ntransport, data, other administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from September 2014 to August 2016. MOHA will be the \nexecuting  agency.  Upon  TA  approval,  a  central  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished  under  MOHA  to  implement  the  TA  and  support  interagency  coordination.  The \ncentral PMU will prepare the handbook. Gender expertise should be included for preparing the \nHandbook. A senior official (director level) will be appointed as the project director under the \nsupervision of a vice-minister. MONRE and the Quang Ninh Provincial People\u2019s Committee will \nbe the implementing agencies. Based on the experience from the TA for Supporting Civil \nService Reform, a task force will be set up in each implementing agency. A technical steering \ncommittee chaired by MOHA will be set up and will include the project director of the central \nPMU, MOHA representatives, heads of task forces, and ADB representatives. The committee \nwill meet at least twice a year to monitor TA implementation and ensure that the TA objectives \nare achieved. \n  \n16.  About 12.5 person-months of international consultant services and 83 person-months of \nnational consultant services will be required. The international consultants will be recruited \nindividually, while the national consultant services will be recruited through a firm using the \nquality-based selection (QBS) method. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  TA \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Resource persons will be engaged to provide \nexpertise  on  jobs  and  competencies  in  various  fields.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The firm to be recruited will also be responsible for delivering \ntraining programs and procuring equipment. \n ", "5 \n \n17.  ADB  will  collaborate  with  development  partners 9  that  have  ongoing  projects  on \nadministrative procedures reform and HRM. The TA will complement the development partners\u2019 \nongoing support by providing a framework guiding the implementation of the HRM reform \nprojects  in  ministries  and  provinces.  ADB  will  also  cooperate  with  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, which is supporting the training of public leaders and civil servants. The \nTA  will  provide  inputs for  training  needs  assessments  and training  programs  designed  by \ngovernment agencies and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. ADB, MOHA, and the \nconsultants will share knowledge with development partners through joint workshops, training \nevents,  and  publications.  Further,  ADB  will  circulate  reports  to  the  PAR  partnership,  the \ninternational development coordination group for the PAR sector. \n \n18.  A  dissemination  plan  that  integrates  communications  and  knowledge  management \napproaches will be developed as part of output 4. Progress will be monitored using the intended \noutcomes and outputs described in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1 million to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the \nImplementation of Civil Service Reform Plan, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                \n9  The Danish International Development Agency and the United Nations Development Programme are providing \nongoing support on implementing a one-stop-shop mechanism for public service delivery and improving the \nperformance of civil servants in nine provinces. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and \nDesign Summary  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators with Baselines \nMechanisms \nImpact       \n      Assumption \nQuality of HRM in  By 2020  Report on public   \ngovernment agencies  The % of government  administration  The government has \nimproved  agencies adopting results- performance index  strong commitment and \noriented HRM with job  leadership on civil service \ndescriptions, competency  reform \nframeworks, and   \nperformance evaluations for  Risk \ncompetitive and   \naccountable recruitment and  Resistance to change of \nperformance evaluation  some agencies and civil \nincreases to 70% (2014  servants \nBaseline=0)  \nOutcome       \n       \nIntegrated HRM system  By 2016:  Studies and report  Risks \nimplemented and sustained  Standardized system for   on public   \nin government agencies  job analysis, job description,  administration  Resistance to change in \n  qualification standards  performance index  some agencies and civil \n  system (competency  servants \nframework) applied in at   \nleast six government  Weak coordination among \nagencies  MOHA, line agencies, and \n(2014 Baseline=0)   local authorities \nOutputs       \n       \n1.
