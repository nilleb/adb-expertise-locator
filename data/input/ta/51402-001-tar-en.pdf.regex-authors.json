INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested knowledge and \nsupport technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen the \ndesign of an integrated, sustainable, and innovative transport plan for the Xiong\u2019an New Area. \nThe TA will provide good practice recommendations on transport policies and support knowledge \nsharing activities with the aim to develop Xiong\u2019an into a green, modern, and technologically \nadvanced district. \n \n2.  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan (2018\u20132020) for the PRC.1 \nThe TA supports the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to (i) making cities more livable, \nand  (ii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Established in 2017, Xiong\u2019an covers the counties of Xiong, Rongcheng, and Anxin in \nHebei province, 150 kilometers (km) southwest of Beijing. With an estimated population of \n1 million, the area has low-intensity, high-concentration, and labor-intensive development such \nas garment, shoe, and plastics manufacturing. Low-technology light industry is the main economic \ndriver contributing to more than 50% of gross domestic product (GDP), while agricultural activities \ncontribute 20%. The average per capita GDP is CNY19,200, which is below the average GDP in \nHebei province.  \n \n4.  Xiong\u2019an will support the noncapital functions of the central government in Beijing. With \nplans to attract international and national resources and set up research centers focusing on \nadvance technology (such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud technology, e-commerce, and \nbiomedical research), Xiong\u2019an is set to become the incubation center for future technological \ndevelopment (such as quantum communication, stem cell research, and nanomaterials). \n \n5.  Xiong\u2019an has limited road and rail links. Four airports serve the area\u2014the nearest is the \nnew Beijing airport (about 100 km away) and the remaining three are 140\u2013170 km away. Xiong\u2019an \nlacks the connectivity and transport infrastructure required to carry out and sustain its expected \nfunctions. With the projected movement of people and industries into Xiong\u2019an, the existing \ntransport capacity will not be enough to support mobility in the area. \n \n6.  The overall planning framework for Xiong\u2019an was disclosed to the public in April 2018.3 \nBased on its development objectives and indicators, detailed plans have been prepared and \npolicy design to attract the necessary human resources and move the noncapital functions of \nBeijing has started. In 2019, planning work for Xiong\u2019an will continue with a focus on attracting \ninnovative and high-technology businesses into the area. By 2020, the development plan for \nXiong\u2019an  will  be  finalized  and  the  initial  framework  and  setup  of  the  advance  technology \nbusinesses will be completed. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2018.

Hebei. \n ", "2 \n7.  Urban transport planning (as well as urban spatial and land use planning) and urban \ninfrastructure construction are supervised by different public agencies in the PRC. The Xiong\u2019an \nPlanning and Construction Bureau oversees the planning and coordination of agencies. \n \n8.  Transport forms an important part of this new area development. To ensure that the area \nwill be livable and accessible with high-quality and sustainable infrastructure, land use and \ntransport plans should be well coordinated. The transport plan should contain elements of \naccessibility, mobility, and innovation that are at par with international standards and best practice. \nAn integrated and sustainable transportation development for Xiong\u2019an will promote sustainable \nurban development, decrease emissions, reduce transport safety incidents, reduce congestion, \nand increase attractiveness and competitiveness for residents and businesses.  \n \n9.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT) provides guidance and support on the development of \nthe sustainable transport plan and interregional linkages in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region and \nneighboring cities. MOT also provides technical and capacity development support on transport-\nrelated matters for Xiong\u2019an. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable transport development realized.4 \nThe TA will have the following outcome: an integrated, sustainable, and innovative transport \ndevelopment plan strengthened.5 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Knowledge support on integrated, sustainable, and innovative transport \nplan for Xiong\u2019an provided. Output 1 will provide the tools for policy makers and planners to \ndevelop Xiong\u2019an into a green, modern, and smart city. The output will be delivered via study \nreports, two workshops, and one seminar. \n(i)  Output 1a: Recommendations on transport development planning will be provided \nbased on international experience and perspectives. Areas of recommendation will \ninclude  \n(a)  integrated and inclusive infrastructure (e.g., transport network, regional \nconnectivity, and passenger terminals and freight hubs layout);  \n(b)  user-oriented services (e.g., personalized services that provide comfort, \nconvenience, and safety for passengers, and economical and efficient \nservices for freight);  \n(c)  innovative  technologies  (e.g.,  intelligent  transport  systems,  connected \nvehicles,  autonomous  vehicles,  shared  mobility,  3D  printing,6 drone,7 \nmodern travel demand modeling simulation8); and \n(d)  Green transport (e.g., new energy technologies that reduce emissions for \nprivate and public transport, including land and water transport).  \n                                                 \n4  State Council. 2017.

The workshops and seminar will be \nattended by the TA steering committee comprising members from Xiong\u2019an, the \nMinistry  of  Transport,  research  institutes,  and  stakeholders  working  on  the \nXiong\u2019an development plan. \n \n12.  Output 2: Pilot demonstration of an innovative technology showcased. Based on the \nfindings of output 1, consultations with stakeholders, and the finalization of the Xiong\u2019an transport \nplan, appropriate pilot project(s) may be identified and implemented. The pilot demonstration of \nselected project(s) will feature the current state-of-the-art high-level technology available, which \nis aligned with Xiong\u2019an\u2019s development objectives. Funding of the pilot project(s) may be identified \nwithin the existing TA or outside source(s). \n \n13.  Output 3: Institutional framework and organizational structure recommendations \nprovided. To achieve a holistic and sustainable transport development in Xiong\u2019an, a fresh \nperspective of institutional framework and organizational structure will need to be established. \nRecommendations on how to integrate and coordinate different government, civil society, and \nprivate sector functions for transport planning and operations will be designed to meet the long-\nterm development objectives of Xiong\u2019an. Output 3 will be delivered jointly with output 1 through \nstudy reports, workshops, and a seminar.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.
