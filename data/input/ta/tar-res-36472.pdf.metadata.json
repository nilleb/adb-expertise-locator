The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing support to agriculture research \nsince 1975, as a means of enhancing crop and livestock productivity, fostering environmental \nsustainability of agricultural systems, and reducing poverty in much of rural Asia. A policy on \nagriculture and natural resources research (ANRR)1 was formulated and approved in 1995, \nwhich reiterated the strong need for sustained assistance to research and particularly to the \nmember centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The \nANRR policy also recommended channeling ADB support for ANRR directly to the international \ncenters  through  an  annual  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  modality  that  supports  a \npackage of high priority research proposals from international agricultural research centers \n(IARCs). Accordingly, the first RETA was approved in 1996 for $5.2 million,2 and five more \nRETAs have been approved since, the last one being in 2001.3 \n \n2.  During 2002, 11 IARCs submitted 14 research proposals to ADB for funding. These \nwere reviewed by the members of the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development \n(ANNRD) Committee4 at a meeting held on 4 April 2002. The following criteria were endorsed \nfor selecting proposals for funding: (i) linkage and likely impact of the proposal on poverty, \nincluding indirect impact, such as through capacity building for national agricultural research and \nextension  systems,  and  for  policymakers;  (ii)  direct  relevance  to  ADB  operations;  and  (iii) \nreadiness  and  completeness  of  the  proposal.  The  Committee  also  decided  to  additionally \nconsider the capacity and past performance of the sponsoring IARC and the emphasis in the \nproposal on technology transfer to farmers and national partners. Accordingly, each proposal \nwas evaluated, and four were selected for inclusion in the proposed RETA for the Seventh \nAgriculture and Natural Resources Research at International Agricultural Research Centers. \nThese include three research projects submitted by CGIAR centers\u2014the International Center \nfor Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid \nTropics (ICRISAT), and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\u2014and one by a \nnon-CGIAR center\u2014the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC).5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite the dramatic economic transformation that swept Asia in the last half of the 20th \ncentury, the Asia and Pacific region still accounts for more than half of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion \npoor,  who  live  in  extreme  poverty  and  subsist  on  less  than  $1  a  day.  Measured  by  the \nheadcount ratio, the incidence of poverty is the highest in South Asia, where, despite increased \nurbanization, a vast majority of the poor still live in rural areas. Poverty and rural economic \nadvancement therefore assumed the highest priority in the international development agenda, \nand various summits have proclaimed strong commitments to poverty reduction. The United \nNations  Millennium  Declaration  of  September  2000  adopted  poverty  reduction  as  its  main \nagenda and pledged to bring down the numbers of people living in extreme poverty to half by \n2015. ADB declared poverty reduction as its overarching goal in March 2000 and initiated \npartnership agreements with its developing member countries (DMCs) to achieve this objective. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n4 In the reorganized structure of ADB, the responsibility for review and short-listing of RETA proposals has been \nvested in the ANRRD Committee, which is comprised of select nominees from the regional and other key \ndepartments.  \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 July 2002. ", "2     \n4.  It is widely accepted in the development community that growth in the agriculture sector \nis key to poverty reduction in Asia because of the large percentage of the poor who live in rural \nareas and are directly or indirectly dependent on it for employment, income, and nutrition. The \nimpact of agricultural growth on rural society was amply demonstrated by the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d \nthat took place in the 1970s and 1980s in Asia, under which cereal production doubled and rural \nincomes increased substantially. The green revolution was the first major attempt at applying \nmodern science and technology to agriculture in Asia. But after more than three decades, the \npackage of technologies and the model that was applied have been largely exhausted, and in \nmany instances new challenges have emerged that need to be addressed in order to reduce \npoverty and keep pace with food demand in rural Asia. \n \n5.  It is estimated that, during the next 30 years, Asia\u2019s population will increase by 1.5 billion \nand the food requirement by 40\u201350%. The challenge is formidable, because future production \nwill have to come largely from increasing cropping intensity and productivity from not so well-\nendowed lands; problems of degraded lands, soil, and water management will have to be \naddressed; ecological and resource management concerns will have to be integrated into the \nnew technology options; and agriculture will have to be diversified to include vegetables, fruits, \nlivestock, fisheries and a range of export crops. According to the estimates of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations,6 more than 550 million hectares of arable lands \nare  degraded  in  Asia.  These  include  areas  that  are  prone  to  drought,  desertification,  soil \nerosion,  loss  of  fertility,  and  depletion  of  forest  cover.  In  many  of  these  areas,  existing \ntechnologies cannot support further increases in production, and new technological options are \nneeded to increase food production and reduce poverty. There is therefore a major need and \nopportunity for supporting and catalyzing innovations in technology, enhancing capacities in \nnational research and extension systems, and supporting appropriate public policy to boost \ngrowth in the agriculture sector.  \n \n6.  ADB has been supporting agricultural research through an annual RETA since 1996 and \nhas so far approved six umbrella RETAs for a total of $31.7 million involving 14 CGIAR centers. \nIn December 2000, the Operations Evaluation Department reviewed ADB\u2019s policy on ANRR and \nevaluated the investments made in agricultural research from 1975 through 2000.7 The study \nconcluded that the policy on ANRR and support to agricultural research continued to be relevant \nto  ADB\u2019s  operations  and  development  objectives  and  should  be  continued.  On  research \ninvestments, the study evaluated a subset of projects funded by ADB in four of the major \nrecipient CGIAR centers and concluded that ADB financing had paid high dividends: a total \neconomic surplus of  $4.2 billion was directly attributable to ADB funding, and there was an \naverage internal rate of return of 65% for all funds invested for the projects. The study also \nconfirmed that the RETA modality is an effective means of channeling funds to the IARCs; and \nthat the IARCs had demonstrated their comparative advantages and proficiency in undertaking \nresearch, in leveraging additional funds, and in building capacity of the national agricultural \nresearch systems (NARSs). Appendix 1 provides a summary of all assistance provided by ADB \nto the IARCs, including CGIAR. \n \n7.  The proposed RETA will be the seventh umbrella RETA for agriculture and natural \nresources research at international agricultural research centers and is aimed at assisting the \nparticipating  DMCs  in  achieving  the  commonly  shared  goals  of  sustainable  agricultural \ndevelopment,  improving  rural  incomes,  and  reducing  poverty.  This  is  proposed  to  be \naccomplished through productivity enhancement of crops (including vegetables) and livestock, \nparticularly in rain-fed and upland areas; improved natural resource management in semiarid \n                                                 \n6  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2002.

", "      3\nareas; and improved in-house capacity for policy formulation. The RETA is therefore consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  ANRR  and  fully  meets  its  three  strategic  objectives  of  sustainable \nmanagement of natural resources, increase in agriculture productivity, and poverty reduction. \nThe proposed RETA also reinforces the priorities and approaches outlined in ADB\u2019s Long-Term \nStrategic  Framework8  and  the  poverty  reduction  strategy9  by  focusing  on  degraded  and \nresource  poor  areas  and  on  subsectors  like  livestock  and  vegetables,  which  have  been \nbypassed by the green revolution and where poverty is pervasive and the capacity to govern \nweak.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  proposed  RETA  aims  at  developing  and  disseminating  technologies  for \nenvironmentally sustainable farming systems; for increasing the resilience of small farming \nsystems, particularly in the uplands and semiarid areas; for utilizing indigenous vegetables to \nimprove  nutrition  in  rural  areas;  and  for  building  capacities  in  national  systems  for  policy \nresearch. The proposed RETA will thereby contribute to the efforts of the 12 participating \nmember countries of ADB to reduce poverty through increasing agricultural productivity and \nfarm incomes, improving human nutrition, conserving natural resources, developing human \nresources, and strengthening the capacity for public policy research.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.     The proposed RETA covers four research projects that share common goals of sustainable \nagriculture  development,  natural  resource  management,  poverty  reduction,  and  capacity \nenhancement in the NARSs. The projects will, however, be independently executed by the four \ncenters\u2014CIAT, ICRISAT, IFPRI, and AVRDC. All four centers have high levels of technical \nskills  and  professional  competence  to  provide  leadership  and  guidance  to  the  NARSs  in \nimplementing the proposed projects. These projects are (i) \u201cImproving livelihoods of upland \nfarmers using participatory approaches to develop more efficient livestock systems\u201d of CIAT; (ii) \n\u201cParticipatory watershed management for reducing poverty and land degradation in the semiarid \ntropics\u201d of ICRISAT; (iii) \u201cPoverty reduction through advisory network, policy research, and \ncapacity strengthening in South Asia\u201d of IFPRI; and (iv) \u201cPromoting utilization of indigenous \nvegetables  for  improved  nutrition  of  resource-poor  households  in  Asia\u201d  of  AVRDC.  These \nprojects address the strategic agendas of the ANRR policy, have been identified in consultation \nwith  the  12  participating  DMCs,  and  will  be  implemented  in  close  collaboration  with  their \nNARSs.  A  synopsis  of  the  projects  is  given  in  paras.  10\u201313,  and  the  detailed  project \ndescriptions, including their project frameworks, are provided in Appendixes 2\u20135.  \n \n10.  Improving  livelihoods  of  upland  farmers  using  participatory  approaches  to \ndevelop more efficient livestock systems. For upland farmers, livestock provides a major \nsource of cash income, draught animal power, transport, and manure for crop production. But \none major constraint in expanding livestock production is the reduced availability of traditional \nanimal feeds such as crop residues and natural grasses because of the growing pressure of \npopulation and the lack of supply of other good quality feed. ADB approved a project for CIAT to \ndevelop sustainable forage technologies for the upland farmers of Asia in 1999,10 which has \ndeveloped and introduced new forage technologies to reduce the labor input, increase livestock \nproduction, and improve soil and water conservation on small crop-livestock farms in the upland \nareas. The proposed project will build on the successes of the first phase project and expand \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

", "4     \nthe adoption of the new forage technologies, integrate them with indigenous fodders and crop \nresidues,  facilitate  local  multiplication  of  new  forages,  introduce  farmer-to-farmer  extension \nmethods at the new sites, and improve regional interaction and linkages. It is aimed at reducing \npoverty and developing sustainable and remunerative farming systems for poor farmers in the \nupland regions of Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n \n11.  Participatory watershed management for reducing poverty and land degradation \nin the semiarid tropics. The vast dryland areas of Asia have been neglected for a long time, \nbut of late there has been an increasing realization that these degraded areas will need to be \nutilized to meet the future demand for food. Additionally, these marginal areas house a large \npercentage of Asia\u2019s poor population (about 250 million), and on poverty grounds alone, they \nneed to be given priority attention. In 1999, ADB approved a project for improving management \nof  natural  resources  for  rain-fed  agriculture,11  which  demonstrated  that  good  watershed \nmanagement practices can effectively conserve soil and water, are easily adopted by farmers, \nand can give 50\u2013250% more income to farmers. The proposed project is aimed at expanding \ntechnological  options  for  dryland  farmers  and  contributing  to  sustainable  management  of \nagriculture and natural resources. It will build on the achievements of the first phase and further \ndevelop policy, institutional, and technological options and strategies for community watershed \nmanagement on a larger scale in People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n \n12.  Poverty  reduction  through  advisory  network,  policy  research,  and  capacity \nstrengthening in South Asia. This project is aimed at addressing the ANRR policy\u2019s strategic \nobjective of public policy research and capacity building for the NARSs. It will support activities \nunder IFPRI\u2019s multicomponent project called the South Asia Initiative, which is cofinanced by \nthe United States Agency for International Development and the European Commission and is \nfocused on providing policy support to the region. The proposed project will establish working \nlevel  mechanisms  and  synergies  between  policymakers  and  policy  research  institutions  to \nenable them to interact and formulate rational policies, generate information and facilitate quality \nresearch  in  collaboration  with  local  research  institutions,  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local \ninstitutions  to  carry  out  analytical  studies  and  policy  research,  promote  understanding  on \nemerging  macro  issues  in  the  sector,  and  facilitate  regional  cooperation.  The  countries \nparticipating in the project are Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. \n \n13.  Promoting utilization of indigenous vegetables for improved nutrition of resource- \npoor households in Asia. The proposed project addresses the problem of food and nutritional \nsecurity of the poor, and loss of biodiversity in the Mekong subregion and Southeast Asia by \npromoting the utilization of indigenous vegetables. Indigenous vegetables are recognized for \ntheir importance in supplementing the food and nutritional needs of people but have remained \nunderutilized  because  of  lack  of  understanding  of  their  importance  and  use  in  production \nsystems and lack of germplasm and seeds for widespread use. AVRDC developed and ADB \napproved  a  project  to  collect,  conserve,  and  utilize  indigenous  vegetables12  in  1999,  and \nthrough  it  assembled  and  conserved  more  than  2,500  accessions,  regenerated  and \ncharacterized more than 50% of the collected material, and commenced evaluation for wider \nadoption by farmers. AVRDC, through this proposed second phase project, will take forward the \nwork of regeneration, characterization, and evaluation of the assembled species; simultaneously \ndevelop sustainable management systems to promote the utilization of indigenous vegetables; \nand build technical and managerial capacities in the national staff to take over and sustain the \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998.

The countries participating in the project are Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the umbrella RETA is estimated at $9.2 million equivalent (Appendix 6). \nADB will finance $3.8 million equivalent (41% of the total cost) on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The sponsoring CGIAR and non-CGIAR centers will finance $2.2 million \nequivalent (24%) from their core budgets, the participating NARSs will contribute $2.6 million \nequivalent (29%), and other external funding agencies will contribute $527,000 equivalent (6%). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB  will  enter  into  an  individual  agreement  with  each  of  the  four  IARCs  whose \nproposals are included under this umbrella RETA. Each IARC will take responsibility for the \nsuccessful completion of its project and will be designated as the Executing Agency for it. The \n12 participating NARSs will be designated as the implementing agencies. They will work in \nclose collaboration with the concerned IARCs and provide them with letters of commitment to \nthis effect prior to RETA commencement. Each of the four executing agencies will appoint a \nproject coordinator and team leader, who will coordinate with the NARSs, plan and supervise all \nactivities  under  the  project,  monitor  their  progress,  and  report  on  it  to  ADB  and  other \ncollaborating partners. Similarly, each implementing agency will appoint a national team leader \nwho will take overall responsibility for coordination and implementation of the project.   \n \n16.  Each project will commence on 1 January 2003 and will be implemented over 3 years. \nProject  planning  workshops  will  be  organized  at  the  beginning  of  the  projects  to  firm  up \nimplementation arrangements with the participating NARSs and other collaborators, and these \nwill be followed by annual review and planning meetings. Each center will be required to submit \nthe following reports to ADB: (i) a comprehensive completion report within 3 months of project \nclosure  in  December  2005,  (ii)  semiannual  progress  reports,  (iii)  semiannual  financial \nstatements accounting for the use of project funds, and (iv) audited annual financial statements. \nFunds will be drawn down in semiannual installments based on each center\u2019s estimate of \nforthcoming expenditures and subject to satisfactory liquidation of expenditures for previously \ndisbursed funds. A project officer with suitable technical expertise will be assigned to administer \nthe projects at ADB and will be required to undertake at least one supervisory mission to each \nof the projects per year. The office of the Director, Agriculture, Natural Resources and Social \nSectors, in close consultation with the offices of the five regional directors for agriculture, \nenvironment  and  natural  resources,13  will  be  responsible  for  overall  administration  of  the \nproposed umbrella RETA, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of status reports. \n \n17.  All participating IARCs will procure goods and services according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. The centers will engage short-term specialists in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB, using the \nbiodata format. Before engaging the resource specialists, the centers will submit their curricula \nvitae to ADB for approval. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance, on a grant basis, to four international agriculture research centers\u2014CIAT, ICRISAT, \nIFPRI, and AVRDC\u2014in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $3,818,000 for the purpose \nof  the  Seventh  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Research  at  International  Agricultural \nResearch Centers. \n                                                 \n13  South Asia Department, Mekong Department, Southeast Asia Department, East and Central Asia Department, and \nPacific Department.

Introduction \n1.  A number of Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs), in \npartnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), are requesting ADB \nassistance in financing this project. \n \n2.  The DMCs would like to demonstrate that forage technologies, developed using farmer \nparticipatory approaches under the ADB-financed regional technical assistance (RETA) project \n\"Developing  Sustainable  Forage  Technologies  for  Resource-Poor  Farmers  in  Asia,\u201d1  can \ncontribute to improving the livelihoods of poor upland farmers. In this latter project, it was \ndemonstrated that new forage technologies could increase livestock production, reduce labor \ninput, and improve soil and water conservation on small crop-livestock farms in the uplands. \nThis project will determine how these outputs contribute to more sustainable livelihoods and \nhow they can be disseminated more widely.  The project focuses on reducing poverty through \nincreased and more efficient livestock production.  \n \n3.  The request for the project came from DMC representatives at a regional workshop on \nthe \"Impact of new forage systems on people, livestock and the environment\" held in January \n2002.2 The participants suggested that a new project should not simply focus on improved \nforages but on how adoption of improved forages might affect household livelihoods and land \nmanagement.  A  draft  proposal  was  circulated  including  elements  of  integrating  introduced \nforages  with  indigenous  fodders  and  crop  residues,  introducing  farmer-to-farmer  extension \nmethods,  creating  greater  market  awareness  among  farmers,  and  assessing  impact  on \nlivelihoods. An iterative process was used to incorporate the wide range of responses. \n \n4.  There  is  strong  support  for  the  project  from  implementing  agencies  in  Cambodia, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Issues \n5.  Livestock contribute more than 50% of the cash income of many upland farmers.3  Apart \nfrom cash income and capital accumulation, livestock provide draught animal power for land \npreparation and transport, and manure for organic fertilizer to improve crop production.  Raising \nincomes through increased livestock production is one of the more attractive alternatives for \nupland farmers, as there is an increasing demand in urban areas for livestock products.  \n \n6.  Feed  supply,4  in  terms  of  both  quantity  and  quality,  remains  a  major  constraint  to \nimproving livestock production. Traditionally, farmers use natural grasslands, indigenous feeds, \n                                                 \n1  Six countries are participating in the RETA project Developing Sustainable Forage Technologies for Resource-\nPoor Upland Farmers in Asia (2000-2002): Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.   \n2  CIAT.  2002.

However,  these  natural  resources  are  decreasing  with \nincreasing population pressure. Many are of low quality, and they cannot meet the needs for \nincreased  livestock  production.  Improved  forages  that  are  adapted  to  different  systems, \nclimates, and soils have been identified and incorporated into traditional farming systems by \ninvolving farmers in the process of evaluation.5 Impact has been demonstrated in reducing labor \nrequirements for feeding livestock, increasing livestock production, and raising income. In East \nKalimantan, Indonesia, there were increases in productivity, ranging from 50% to 65% due to \nincreased weight gain, reduced labor input, and sale of manure.6  In Viet Nam, calf mortality was \nreduced by 20% through maintaining the cow and calf near the house for 1 month, growth rate \nof pigs was increased from 330 grams (g)/day to 450 g/day by feeding legumes, and carp \nproduction was 25% higher when fed improved grasses compared with natural grasses. There \nwere large impacts on well-being; in general, time saved in feeding animals was used for \nattending meetings, training activities, and education; children were freed to attend secondary \nschool; while women said they had more time for off-farm activities and rest.  Issues that remain \nto be addressed include (i) are the improved forage systems sustainable? (ii) how can the use \nof improved forages be more fully integrated with indigenous fodders and crop residues? and \n(iii) what is the potential impact on overall household economy under different farming systems?  \n \n7.  How can these results be extended to new farmers? Growing forages as a crop is a new \nexperience for most farmers.  They have to learn to manage and utilize this new crop, and only \nwith time will appreciate the full potential of the new forage systems. Researchers know that \ntropical grasses and legumes can contribute to more sustainable land use under sloping upland \nfarming systems.  Legumes improve soil fertility, grass and legume hedgerows and cover crops \nreduce erosion, while trees can be used for live fences.  Experience from the current project \n(footnote 1) is that farmers initially evaluate forages for feeding livestock\u2014cattle, buffaloes, \ngoats, pigs\u2014and fish, but, as they begin to integrate them into their farming system, they see \nthe benefit for soil and water conservation. Initially, grasses receive the most attention because \nof their rapid growth and easier management. As there is success with grasses, farmers begin \nto appreciate that legumes have a complementary role in producing higher quality feed and \nimproving soil fertility. In Bukidnon, Philippines, soil conservation has become the first priority. In \nDaklak, Viet Nam, farmers are moving from \u201ccut-and-carry\u201d grass systems to grazing grass-\nlegume systems to reduce labor and improve nutrient cycling. In Tuyen Quang, Viet Nam, some \nwomen farmers are replacing a portion of their rice and maize with improved forages to fatten \ncattle in order to diversify, thus reducing risk and increasing overall productivity. This issue of \nfarmers  having  to  gain  experience  needs  to  be  recognized  when  developing  methods  for \nextending forage technologies. Experience has shown that farmer-to-farmer extension methods \ncan speed up the process of dissemination.  Also, effective local seed multiplication systems \nhave to be put in place, as forage seed and planting material are not traded in the local market. \n \n8.  Capacity building has been a major feature of earlier projects on developing new forage \nsystems (footnotes 1, 5). District extension agents have been key players in facilitating the \nprocess when they have acquired knowledge of forage agronomy and skills in working with \nfarmers in a participatory manner.  However, most extension systems in the region have worked \nunder the assumption of transferring technologies to farmers rather than presenting them with \ndifferent options that they can evaluate themselves.  Thus there is a need to institutionalize the \nuse of participatory processes more widely within government institutions.  \n \n                                                 \n5   Stur, W.W. 2000.

Farmers value livestock, in particular large ruminants, as important assets that can be \nsold in times of financial crisis. There is a need to develop a greater commercial consciousness \nof the role that livestock can play in regular income generation.  This involves an emphasis on \nturn-off7 and creation of improved marketing chains that respond to market demand, and in \nwhich farmers have some control in the marketing process. In Viet Nam, the project can link \nwith a new CIAT-managed Agroenterprise Development Project.  \n \n10.  These issues were discussed at the workshop held in January 2002. Recommendations \nwere as follows: \n \n(i)  In making use of improved forage systems, greater benefit would be achieved \nthrough fully integrating their use with other feed materials and increasing the \nuse of legume.  \n(ii)  In  dissemination,  more  focus  is  needed  on  application  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) at the village level, scaling up seed multiplication systems, and \nimproving  extension  methods,  so  as  to  demonstrate  impact  on  income \ngeneration and poverty reduction.  \n(iii)  There is a need for training in the application of M&E, reinforcement of existing \nskills, and institutionalizing the use of participatory approaches.   \n(iv)  Better understanding of market issues, together with improved farmer awareness \nof  market  prices  and  linkages,  would  lead  to  wider  adoption  of  improved \ntechnologies.  \n(v)  Greater  impact  could  be  achieved  by  strengthening  linkages  and  integrating \nefforts with other projects.   \n \n11.  The  proposed  project  will  complement  the  ADB-financed  RETA  project  to  the \nInternational Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) for Improvement of Integrated Crop-Livestock \nProduction Systems to Reduce Poverty in Rainfed Areas of Southeast Asia.8  Both projects \ninvolve research for development, capacity building, dissemination, and networking, but they \ndiffer in terms of the scope of activities. The ILRI project seeks to (i) improve the efficiency of \nutilization of crop residues, crop products, and the use of multipurpose block licks; (ii) provide \ntechnical training in these areas; (iii) initiate policy changes to facilitate smallholder farmer \nadoption of improved technologies; and (iv) extend improved feed technologies to a larger group \nof  farmers.  This  proposed  project  is  targeted  at  more  specific  interventions  involving  the \nutilization and dissemination of improved forage technologies. There is a greater focus on \nprocess in terms of developing appropriate farmer participatory approaches for generation, \ndelivery, and monitoring, and for institutionalizing these approaches within partner DMCs. The \nobjective extends beyond increasing livestock production  \nto  improving  livelihoods  of  poor  farm  households.  Collaboration  with  ILRI  is  planned  on \ndeveloping a common database for information sharing, making farmers at focus sites aware of \nalternative technologies from each project during dissemination, and integrating the networks \nfacilitated by the two organizations. \n \n12.  The project accords with CIAT's strategic plan9 for 2001-2010 and addresses ADB\u2019s \nstrategy on poverty reduction10 and is consistent with the ADB\u2019s policy on agriculture and \n                                                 \n7  Controlling and shortening the time in which animals achieve market weight. \n8 ADB. 2001.

The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Outputs \n13.  The overall goal is to contribute to reducing poverty in upland areas through increasing \nthe welfare of men and women farmers and the resilience of farming systems. \n \n14.  The purpose of the project is to: \n \n(i)  improve  the  sustainable  livelihood  of  small  farmers  in  the  uplands  through \nintensification of crop-livestock systems, using farmer participatory approaches to \nimprove and deliver forage and feed technologies; and  \n(ii)  improve delivery mechanisms in participating DMCs for the dissemination of \nthese technologies.   \n \n15.  The outputs of the project will be:  \n \n(i)  integrated feeding systems for livestock that optimize the use of improved and \nindigenous fodders and crop residues, and farm labor; \n(ii)  improved methods to develop forage feed systems and extend them to new \nfarmers, optimizing the use of M&E for feedback to others in the community; \n(iii)  increased capacity in DMCs, at different levels, to expand the use of improved \nforage and feed systems and respond to local needs; \n(iv)  comparison of development opportunities and market and logistic constraints for \nintensification of smallholder livestock systems across sites in five countries; and \n(v)  improved regional interaction and linkages with national and externally funded \ndevelopment projects that ensure synergistic and multiplier effects.  \n \n16.  The performance indicators and monitoring mechanisms of the project are summarized \nin the project framework (Table A2.1). \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  It is planned to achieve the expected outputs through staff of implementing agencies of \nthe  collaborating  DMCs  by  providing  technical  and  financial  support  to  them.  The  project \ncoordinator will prepare annual workplans with the site managers in each country and coach \nthem as needed.  All staff will use participatory approaches and tools in implementing the \nproject. Technical training will be provided to national coordinators and other key national staff, \nwho in turn will provide in-country training to research and extension staff. The key activities to \nachieve each output are listed in Table A2.1. \n \n18.  The main assumptions are that there is a continuing and increasing demand for livestock \nproducts, that there is continued collaboration with district and provincial staff, that personnel \nare assigned to the project on a long-term basis, and that they receive support from their \nsupervisors. Past experience shows that these assumptions will be met. All countries are now \nfocusing  on  alternative  commodities  to  rice,  with  livestock  production  having  high  priority. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1995.

Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated at $2.105 million  \n(Table A2.2). It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $950,000 to finance 45% of the total \ncost of the project. The remaining cost will be financed by CIAT ($300,000 or 14% of the total \ncost) and the DMCs ($855,000 equivalent or 41% of the total cost). \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  CIAT will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the project. CIAT is a member of the \nConsultative Group on International Agricultural Research and is dedicated to the reduction of \npoverty in developing countries of the tropics by applying science to agriculture to increase \nproduction while sustaining the natural resource base. CIAT is implementing the RETA 5866 \nproject \"Developing Sustainable Forage Technologies for Resource-Poor Upland Farmers in \nAsia,\" which will be completed in December 2002. Also, CIAT is implementing the Australian \nAgency for International Development-funded \"Forage and Livestock Systems Project\" in the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), which will continue until 2005. The CIAT team in \nAsia includes specialists in forage agronomy and animal nutrition, forage agronomy, systems \nresearch, soils and land management, agroenterprise development, and anthropology.  CIAT \nwill administer the project and coordinate it through its Regional Office in Vientiane, Lao PDR. It \nwill be assisted by a steering committee from the DMCs and ADB, which will monitor progress \nand approve yearly work plans.  CIAT will be responsible for technical and financial reporting to \nADB. \n \n21.  The  DMCs  and  geographical  areas  where  the  project  will  operate  are  Cambodia \n(northeast  uplands),  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (Hainan),  Indonesia  (East  Kalimantan), \nPhilippines (northern Mindanao), and Viet Nam (Tuyen Quang [northern mountains] and Daklak \n[south  central  highlands]).  These  are  areas  with  upland  farming  systems,  where  there  is \ncontinuing rural poverty, and where many marginalized communities are located. All countries \nexcept Cambodia participated in the previous project. Cambodia was included this time because \nit has a large livestock population and there is opportunity to increase productivity by introducing \nimproved forages. Districts will be involved directly in planning and implementation in East \nKalimantan,  Indonesia.  East  Kalimantan  has  been  requested  by  the  Indonesian  Director \nGeneral  of  Livestock  Services  to  provide  training  in  developing  forage  systems  for  other \nprovinces. More than 5,000 households will benefit from the project, including about 2,500 that \nwere involved in the first RETA project (footnote 1). There will be reduced activity in Lao PDR \nand Thailand. Lao PDR now has a bilateral project that is focusing on similar objectives and \ndoes not have the capacity to participate in both projects. Thailand has more technical and \nfinancial resources than the other countries and is proposing to participate through providing \ntechnical assistance in farmer seed production, and undertaking specific research studies as \nrequired by the other DMCs. Both will continue as associate members and will continue to \ninteract and share information as a member of the Southeast Asia Feed and Forages Research \nand Development network. As Cambodia will be a new member, activities will be focused mainly \non developing rather than extending forage systems. The list of implementing agencies is \nshown in Table A2.3. \n \n22.  CIAT will engage the services of a full-time project coordinator, who will be responsible \nfor  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  project  under  the  supervision  of  the  regional ", "  Appendix 2  21 \ncoordinator for CIAT in Asia. The project coordinator will be assisted by a team of CIAT subject \nmatter specialists, while each DMC will appoint a national coordinator who will coordinate the in-\ncountry research for development and will submit required quarterly and semiannual progress \nand financial reports to the project coordinator.  Between annual workshops, the CIAT team will \nprovide backstopping to the national programs by conducting regular visits to the different sites \nand also by arranging cross-country visits.  The project will continue links to generic CIAT \nprojects in tropical forages, participatory research, and impact assessment, and to bilateral \ndevelopment projects with relevant livestock and natural resource management components, \nwith the aim of sharing results on forage technologies and farmer participatory approaches, and \nbroadening the impact of the project.   \n \n23.  Services  of  international  consultants  will  be  used  to  undertake  field  studies  on \nconstraints for agroenterprise development, and on the economic impact of improved livestock \nsystems on the entire household economy and household livelihoods.  It is anticipated that there \nwill be one long-term (36 person-months) international resource specialist in forages and three \nshort-term experts for 2 months each in agro-enterprise development, monitoring, and impact \nassessment. The suggested terms of reference will be discussed further with national partners \nand provided to ADB after the first project planning workshop. \n \n24.  The project will be implemented over a period of 3 years beginning January 2003. The \nfirst workshop, to be held at the beginning of 2003, will provide an opportunity to introduce the \ngoal, objectives, strategies, and work plans of the project, to revise outputs, and to set priorities. \nThe EA, in consultation with the implementing agencies and other stakeholders, will determine, \nduring the first project planning workshop, the schedule of activities, the key milestones, and \nclearly  measurable  performance  indicators  and  submit  the  same  to  ADB,  immediately \nthereafter. The second workshop will be held at the beginning of 2004 to assess the progress \nmade and set future directions. The third and final workshop will be held at the beginning of \n2005 to assess the accomplishments to date and to finalize the year\u2019s program of activities.  \nThe EA will submit to ADB quarterly and semiannual technical progress reports, semiannual \nfinancial statements accounting for the use of funds, and an annual audit of the financial \nstatements  by  the  CIAT  Internal  Audit  Unit.    Funds  will  be  drawn  down  in  semiannual \ninstallments  based  on  the  EA\u2019s  estimates  of  the  forthcoming  activities,  and  subject  to \nsatisfactory substantiation of expenditures at the end of corresponding 6-month periods.  A \ncomprehensive completion report will be submitted to ADB by the EA within 4 months after the \ncompletion  of  the  project.    CIAT  will  be  responsible  for  the  procurement  of  equipment  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and for the engagement of international \nexperts in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, or through other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n25.  There will be both participatory and formal M&E. Participatory M&E systems will be \nestablished for the activities at each site.  Local groups of farmers and district officers will select \nindicators for different activities, providing a basis for determining progress towards achieving \nthe expected outputs. In addition, district officers will maintain records of 30 representative \nhouseholds at each site to obtain information for assessing the performance indicators.   \n \n26.  Within ADB, the staff assigned for the project will monitor the progress of the work and \nconduct reviews as appropriate. \n \n \n \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.1: Technical Assistance Framework, \nInternational Center for Tropical Agriculture \n \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nA.

Introduction  \n \n1.  The developing countries of Asia are characterized by high demographic pressure on \nrural areas (70%) coupled with major dependency on land as the means of livelihood.  About \n700 million hectares (ha) of rain-fed areas in Asia are prone to severe land degradation and \nface  severe  water  scarcity  for  growing  crops.  The  result  is  low  productivity,  poverty,  and \ndegradation  of  natural  resources.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  the  International  Crops  Research  Institute  for  the  Semi-Arid  Tropics \n(ICRISAT)  and  three  developing  country  members\u2014India,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam\u2014for  a \nproject on \u201cImproving Management of Natural Resources for Sustainable Rainfed Agriculture\u201d \n(under  RETA  5812.)01  The  ICRISAT  scientists  and  participating  country  partners  have \ndeveloped and successfully evaluated a \u201cconsortium model\u201d for sustainably managing natural \nresources in the watersheds through full farmer participation beginning with problem analysis. \nThe consortium model has been developed as an information exchange and interactive network \namong scientists who are working on similar issues in different countries, so that efforts are not \nduplicated, cross learning is facilitated, and the knowledge pool is built up. The results at the \nselected  five  benchmark  sites  (120\u201310,000  ha)  demonstrated  that  farmers\u2019  crop  yields \nincreased substantially (27\u2013286%), cropping intensity increased by 13\u201325% (mainly due to \nincreased groundwater availability), ground cover improved (18\u201325%), soil erosion was reduced \nby 1/3, and rainwater use efficiency increased (from 33 to 67%). \n \n2.  The participating country partners and ICRISAT have requested ADB\u2019s assistance for a \nfollow-up  proposal  to  consolidate  the  learnings  and  benefits  of  the  ADB-supported  project \n(RETA 5812) and demonstrate to a larger community of farmers, scientists of the national \nagriculture  research  systems  (NARSs),  and  other  stakeholders  the  best  techniques  of  the \nintegrated watershed management approach. The first phase developed the model at five \nbenchmark sites and it is proposed to extend the benefits by scaling it up to 25 benchmark \nwatersheds in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The \nintegrated  watershed  management  approach  that  will  be  applied  will  focus  on  increasing \nincomes  of  farmers  through  other  livelihood  sources  such  as  livestock-based  activities. \nIncreased biomass production with improved water availability in rain-fed areas would support \nlivestock-based activities for generating additional incomes.   \n \n3.  The participating countries were selected based on the target ecoregion of assured \nannual rainfall (800\u20131,300 millimeters [mm]) with medium to high water-holding capacity soils \n(150\u2013200 mm) in Asia. India, Thailand, and Viet Nam were selected for RETA 5812 because of \nthe large areas of rain-fed systems in these countries. These will be continued and the PRC has \nbeen  included  because  many  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  in  the  south  (provinces  of \nYunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan) have large rain-fed tracts and possess similar \nagroecological project areas as the other countries. About 5,000 farm families, corresponding to \nabout 30,000 rural people, in the selected benchmark sites will be the direct beneficiaries of the \nproject, but benefits and beneficiaries will multiply several-fold as the technologies spread and \ntheir adoption by the farmers is facilitated by trained staff of the NARSs and other partners.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

The \u201cgreen revolution\u201d in Asia led to major production gains in well-endowed areas; \nhowever, it bypassed development of vast dryland areas. Of late a realization has come that \nfuture increases in food production to meet growing needs have to come from the hitherto rain-\nfed lands. Recent research findings on efficient rainwater management and improved crop \nproduction technologies through integrated watershed management have shown good promise. \nThe research at the International Food Policy Research Institute has shown that increased \ninvestments in many rain-fed areas, particularly in agricultural technology, human capital, and \ninfrastructure, have had a much larger impact on poverty.2 \n5.  The rain-fed areas of Asia are home to about 237 million poor people and suffer from \nwidespread land degradation, water shortage, and dropping groundwater table. Global warming \nas  a  result  of  climate  change  may  further  degrade  these  drylands,  leading  to  reduced \nproductivity  and  desertification.  Increased  productivity  and  reduction  of  poverty  could  be \nachieved  through  minimizing  the  degradation  of  natural  resources  by  adopting  a  farmer-\nparticipatory comprehensive watershed management approach. These areas are priority areas \nof ADB, which has identified agricultural research as a key element in reducing rural poverty in \nAsia with emphasis on land- and water-saving innovations that permit growth in food production \nfrom already cropped lands.2  Rosegrant and Hazell3 argued in the same ADB publication that, \non poverty and environmental grounds alone, more attention will have to be given to less \nfavored lands in setting priorities for policy and public investments.  \n6.  The  important  lessons  from  the  work  carried  out  at  five  benchmark  sites  in  three \ncountries  supported  through  RETA  5812  revealed  that  strengthening  of  community-based \norganizations and collective action by the community are critical for managing natural resources \nin watersheds sustainably.  Further, technical backstopping of watersheds through a consortium \nmodel  increased  crop  yields  substantially  (27\u2013286%)  by  adopting  environment-friendly \nintegrated soil, water, nutrient, and pest management options.   \n7.  Increased  rainwater  harvesting  measures  resulted  in  increased  water  availability, \nincreased  biomass  production  through  increased  resource  use  efficiency,  and  increased \ncropping intensities.  Farmers could diversify their sources of incomes by increasing crop-\nlivestock-based activities and intensify land use through multiple cropping. Improved soil, water, \nand nutrient management (SWNM) options reduced runoff (25% to 14%), increased rainwater \nuse efficiency (33% to 67%), and reduced soil loss (6.4 tons (t)/ha/year to 1.5 t/ha/year). \nCarrying capacity of drylands increased by 2\u20134 times by adopting an integrated watershed \nmanagement  approach.  Long-term  studies  at  ICRISAT  revealed  that  improved  watershed \nmanagement  along  with  increased  productivity  also  resulted  in  increased  sequestration  of \ncarbon (7.4 t/ha) in soil and improved soil quality during the last 22 years as compared with the \ntraditional system followed by the farmers.  \n8.  Legumes derived 42\u201390% of their nitrogen requirements through biological nitrogen \nfixation. Loppings of Gliricidia planted on bunds provided 30\u201350 kilograms of Nitrogen/ha/year in \n                                                 \n2  Hazell, P.B.R. and S. Fan. 1998.

Organic  residues  could  be  converted  into  valuable  manure  using \nearthworms,  which  increased  crop  yields  through  improved  soil  fertility.  Integrated  nutrient \nmanagement and diversification of cereal-based systems using legumes such as soybean, \npigeonpea,  chickpea,  swordbean,  ricebean,  groundnut,  and  greengram  have  caught  the \nattention of farmers in the benchmark sites.  At the Thanh Ha watershed in Viet Nam, maize \narea decreased from 75% to 50% after the interventions with the concomitant increase in area \nunder legumes. In the Adarsha watershed in India pigeonpea area increased from 50 ha to 180 \nha.    In  Viet  Nam  mungbean-groundnut-watermelon,  mungbean-soybean-watermelon,  and \ngroundnut-watermelon systems gave 51\u2013268% more income than the traditional maize-based \nsystems.  \n9.  The  impact  of  watersheds  increased  substantially  when  such  programs  became \nlivelihood programs by involving youths, women, and landless people in the income-generating \nactivities. Capacity building for NARSs and farmers is critical for sustainability of watersheds, \nand appropriate social, institutional, and policy arrangements are needed. Successful watershed \nmanagement  models  at  benchmark  sites  generate  public  goods  through  reduced  soil \ndegradation,  increasing  biodiversity,  increased  carbon  sequestration,  and  improved  water \navailability.  \n10.  There is a need to strengthen and consolidate the promising results and the gains \nalready  made  in  the  area  of  natural  resources  management  during  implementation  of  the \nongoing project (RETA 5812) and develop a framework/mechanism for scaling up the benefits \nof  improved  technologies  at  the  ecoregional  scale  (Table  A3.1),  and  for  sustainable \nmanagement  of  watersheds  by  local  stakeholders.  Increased  availability  of  water  through \nwatershed management could lead to changes in cropping patterns and increased withdrawal of \ngroundwater. There is therefore need to develop social, institutional, and policy mechanisms for \nsustainable use of groundwater resources, and considering the dynamics of resource use, the \nneed for evaluating long-term impacts of watershed development on natural resources. \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purposes and Outputs \n11.  The proposed research project seeks to scale up and sustain the benefits of improved \nwatershed management by establishing 25 nucleus watersheds in four countries. The project \nwill also evaluate improved institutional and technological options to manage natural resources \nsustainably in the watersheds. The benefits will be assessed by assessing the on-site impacts \nof improved watershed management in the target ecoregion. The goal is to reduce rural poverty \nby increasing incomes and minimizing environmental degradation through integrated watershed \nmanagement in the rain-fed areas of Asia.  \n12.  The specific outputs of the proposed project will be: \n(i)  improved  policy,  institutional,  and  technological  options  and  strategies  for \ncommunity watershed management, improved utilization of agrotechnical and \nbioeconomic models and participatory methods, and knowledge sharing of viable \nwatershed management with NARSs and other stakeholders; and \n(ii)  on-farm participatory evaluation of land, water, nutrient, and crop management \noptions for improving and sustaining productivity of watersheds and strengthened \ncapacity to assess on-site impacts of improved management . \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The project focuses on the intermediate rainfall ecoregion (800\u20131,300 millimeters [mm] \nper annum) where soils have medium to relatively high water-holding capacity (150\u2013200 mm). \nThe  proposed  project  will  be  implemented  at  the  five  ongoing  benchmark  sites  (nucleus \nwatersheds) in India, Thailand, and Viet Nam, where scaling up will be achieved by establishing \n18 additional nucleus watersheds. Further expansion in the target ecoregion will be achieved by \nexpanding the activities to the PRC, where two nucleus watersheds will be established. The \nscaling up from 5 to 25 nucleus watersheds in four countries will ensure that the benefits of \nimproved watershed management research reach many small and poor households in the rain-\nfed areas of Asia.  \n14.  The lessons from RETA 5812 will be used to develop a strategy for scaling up the \nbenefits obtained at the nucleus watershed to satellite watersheds in the ecoregion. These \ninclude farmer participatory planning and implementation, convergence of various livelihood \nactivities using the consortium model, and the new approach of linking nucleus watersheds with \nsatellite watersheds to ensure faster flow of technological options from farmers to farmers. \nThese were found very effective in India and will be further evaluated, refined, and adapted in all \nfour  countries.  The  project  will  also  characterize  technological,  social,  institutional,  and \neconomic constraints at the watershed level in the target ecoregion and suggest remedial \nmeasures. With the increased productivity of biomass and increased groundwater availability, \nthe systems will be diversified by evaluating crop-livestock water management systems. To \nscale up the benefits from nucleus watersheds to larger areas, new approaches and institutional \nneeds will be worked out and evaluated. Adoption of improved options to manage watersheds \nwill  result  in  identifying  technological  and  institutional  options  to  minimize  environmental \ndegradation.  \n15.  The  project  will  include  the  following  activities:  (i)  identification,  evaluation,  and \ndevelopment of remedial measures to technological, social, and economic constraints at the \nwatershed implementation level; (ii) refinement and adaptation of improved technologies, policy \noptions, and institutional strategies to upscale community-scale watershed management; (iii) \ndevelopment and evaluation of crop-livestock and water management systems for efficient \nutilization of water resources at the watershed scale; (iv) identification of policy and institutional \nneeds for scaling up the benefits of watershed management and strategies for sustaining \nwatersheds beyond the project; (v) organization and strengthening of watershed association \nand  users\u2019  groups  including  special  interest  groups  such  as  women  for  sustainable \nmanagement of watershed at benchmark sites; (vi) knowledge sharing and capacity building \nthrough development of the skills of NARSs scientists, technology transfer agents, and farmers \nfor scaling up the benefits of watershed technology; (vii) monitoring and quantification of on-site \nimpacts of improved watershed management technologies on rural livelihoods, on the natural \nresource base, and on the markets for specific commodities being produced through new crop \nrotations that have been introduced in the watersheds; and (viii) development and adoption of \nnew  science  tools  for  implementing  and  assessing  the  long-term  impacts  of  watershed \nmanagement programs.  \n16.  In the capacity-building component the project will adapt the concept of \u201clearning sites\u201d \non the farmers\u2019 fields. The nucleus watersheds will become the sites of learning for the farmers, \nnongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders. Through capacity building the farmers \nwill become the \u201cmaster trainers\u201d for the farmers in the satellite watersheds. Specialized skill \ngroups  including  women  will  be  trained  in  income-generating  activities  for  improving  the \nlivelihoods of the landless and other specific groups such as women and youths.  ", "  Appendix 3  33 \n17.  The component for assessing the on-site impact will involve continuous monitoring and \nquantification  of  impacts  of  improved  technologies  on  rural  livelihoods  and  the  natural \nresources.  The knowledge about impacts on rural livelihoods and natural resources will help in \nsensitizing the NARSs, policymakers, and development investors about the need to manage \nnatural resources sustainably.  The project will also develop and adapt new science tools for \nmanaging natural resources in the watersheds. \n3.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  total  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $2.8  million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies (Table A3.2).  It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $1.3 million (46.4% of \nthe total cost) from the ADB-funded TA program. ICRISAT will provide $700,000 (25%), while \nthe NARSs will provide $800,000 equivalent (28.5%), primarily as in-kind contribution (local \nstaff, laboratory space and equipment, and watershed development funds in the case of India).  \n4.  Implementation Arrangements   \n19.  ICRISAT, which has provided excellent coordination and leadership in implementing \nphase I (RETA 5812), will be the Executing Agency. The NARSs will be the implementing \nagencies (IAs) (Table A3.3). ICRISAT will continue to be responsible for the overall technical \nand  financial  management  of  the  study,  including  providing  technical  backstopping  for \nparticipating  NARSs.  A  multidisciplinary  team  of  scientists  from  ICRISAT,  consisting  of  an \nagronomist,  soil  biologist,  soil  fertility  specialist,  resource  economist,  socioeconomist,  soil \nphysicist, soil and water management scientist, entomologist, technology exchange specialist, \nand crop modeler, will provide technical support. The steering committee, consisting of existing \ncountry coordinators and the project team manager of ICRISAT, will meet annually to approve \nthe  yearly  workplans  and  budgetary  allocations  to  the  NARSs.  The  Executing  Agency,  in \nconsultation with the IAs and other stakeholders, will determine, during the first project planning \nworkshop, the schedule of activities, the key milestones, and clearly measurable performance \nindicators and submit the same to ADB immediately thereafter. The project will be managed and \nsupervised by the same project manager who has successfully implemented phase I.  \n20.  The project will be implemented over 3 years beginning on 1 January 2003.  ICRISAT \nwill organize one project planning and two review workshops and one final symposium to \ndisseminate  the  research  results  and  provide  a  forum  for  discussion  with  institutions, \npolicymakers, and aid agencies working on such issues in the project areas. Results from the \n25 benchmark sites will also be widely disseminated through audio, video, and print media, and \non  ICRISAT\u2019s  website.  ICRISAT  will  submit  the  following  reports  to  ADB:  (i)  semiannual \nprogress report, (ii) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of study funds; and \n(iii) an annual audited financial statement. Funds will be drawn-down in semiannual installments \nbased on ICRISAT\u2019s estimate of the forthcoming 6-months expenditure, and ADB will disburse \nTA funds for the project subject to satisfactory liquidation of past expenditures by ICRISAT. \nICRISAT will procure goods and services and recruit short-term specialists in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants as appropriate, or \nthrough other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Within 3 months of completion, ICRISAT will \nsubmit to ADB a comprehensive project completion report.  \n5.  Potential Project Impact \n21.  The on-farm participatory integrated watershed management research supported by \nADB through RETA 5812 in India, Thailand, and Viet Nam has showed very promising results in ", "34  Appendix 3 \nterms of improved natural resources, improved environment quality, sustainable crop yields, and \nincreased incomes of the rural people at benchmark sites. Farmers\u2019 participatory watershed \nmanagement at benchmark sites showed increased groundwater (up to 5.5 meters) and surface \nwater availability. As an example, benefits from two technologies: improved land management \noption (e.g., planting on contour, ridges, and furrows) and in-situ generation of Nitrogen-rich \norganic material through loppings of Gliricidia planted on bunds for soybean crop grown in India \n(5.6 million ha), Thailand (0.6 million ha), and Viet Nam (0.15 million ha) were calculated, and it \nwas found that an ex-ante impact of proposed investments in terms of economic value would be \n$781 million in 10 years. This value is a conservative estimate, as the benefits for other rain-fed \ncrops, such as maize, sorghum, pigeonpea, mungbean, and groundnut, and also from other \ntechnologies  such  as  integrated  nutrient  management,  integrated  pest  management,  and \nincreased water availability would be far more.  \n22.  In addition, benefits such as improved water quality owing to reduced pollution of water \nbodies due to less use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reduced siltation of waterbodies, \nreduced risk of downstream flooding, and increased water availability in the watersheds will be \nachieved, which will improve environmental quality. Reduced soil erosion and improved water \navailability, along with increased productivity of rain-fed areas, will help sustain productivity and \nincrease incomes for the rural people.  Improved natural resources such as soil and water will \nhave a good impact on the livelihoods of women through improved water availability, reduced \ndrudgery, and improved health. The most important impact will be in terms of empowered \nstakeholders in the project area who are well trained in the sustainable management of natural \nresources and who will act as agents to sensitize other farmers, researchers, and policymakers \nfor managing watersheds sustainably.  \n23.  Most importantly, the farming community of the project area will learn new methods of \nmanaging natural resources, will be endowed with new knowledge, and will be empowered to \ntake  informed  decisions  for  managing  natural  resources.  Technology  dissemination  will  be \nfaster and wider, as farmers themselves will be the trainers for their peers. They will gain self-\nconfidence through increased awareness. Strengthening community-based organizations will \nalso assist in sustainably managing the natural resources in the project area. The benefits of \nincreased productivity and increased incomes by farmers will be realized on a larger scale in the \necoregion  through  adoption  of  improved  soil,  water,  nutrient,  crop,  and  pest  management \noptions. Improved water availability in the project area will result in increased cropping intensity \nand also improved drinking water availability with reduced drudgery for women. Adoption of \nimproved  SWNM  options  on  their  farms  and  improved  management  of  common  property \nresources at the community level will result in an improved natural resource base, which is a \nkey for their livelihood. Improved livelihood opportunities will result in increased incomes, less \nmigration from the villages, and improved living standards by achieving food security, improved \nhealth, and better socioeconomic status. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  35 \n Table A3.1: Technical Assistance Framework, \nInternational Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics \n \n \nPerformance  Monitoring   Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nA.

Introduction \n1.  To address the high levels of poverty through policy dialogue, policy research, and \ncapacity strengthening, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has undertaken \na multicomponent project in South Asia entitled the South Asia Initiative (SAI).  SAI involves \nthree programmatic approaches\u2014policy analysis and advisory network, applied research, and \ncapacity strengthening\u2014and six countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri \nLanka). The Policy Analysis and Advisory Network of South Asia (PAANSA) builds synergy \nthrough a network of policymakers, advisors, and analysts for effective policy dialogue. The \napplied research component allows quality research to be undertaken on critical policy issues \nfacing  the  food,  agriculture,  and  rural  sectors  of  the  region.  The  capacity  strengthening \ncomponent  develops  local  capacity  by  conducting  collaborative  research,  training,  and \nexchange  programs  with  local  institutions,  government  agencies  (national  planning \ncommissions  and  ministries  of  agriculture),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  the \nprivate sector. Since its inception in January 2002, SAI has held one PAANSA consultative \nmeeting, one country meeting in India, and one regional training workshop on methodology for \nassessing market reforms on food security.  SAI is holding a regional training in November 2002 \non the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade, and agriculture in South Asia; and a workshop \non agricultural diversification. In response to a request from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto prepare a technical assistance (TA) proposal, IFPRI proposes to work in four countries\u2014 \nBangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan.  ADB will play a role in expanding the activities and \nsize of the SAI and the network.  Although this project will complement other funding sources for \nsustaining the above program activities in South Asia, the majority of the currently available \nfunding  is  for  India.  ADB  funding  will  support  SAI  activities  primarily  in  Bangladesh  and \nPakistan.  \n \nB.  Issues \n2.  South Asia remains a hot spot on the global poverty map. More than 40% of the poor in \nthe world are living in South Asia. In fact, Bangladesh and eastern India alone have more poor \npeople living on under a dollar a day than sub-Saharan Africa. The decline in poverty that was \nwitnessed during the 1970s and 1980s as a result of the green revolution seems to have slowed \ndown during the 1990s. In absolute terms, the number of people living below the poverty line \nwas higher by the end of the 1990s than 30 years ago. Therefore, reducing poverty in South \nAsia  remains  a  daunting  challenge  to  national  governments,  international  development \nagencies,  and  aid  agencies.  In  November  1999,  ADB  adopted  a  new  poverty  reduction \nstrategy,1 which declares poverty reduction as ADB\u2019s main goal.  This project aims at supporting \nthis objective through collaborative policy research, policy dialogue, and capacity strengthening \nof policymakers and policy researchers in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan.   \n \n3.  IFPRI\u2019s interaction with policymakers, advisors, and researchers in South Asia during \npast research projects has resulted in several lessons regarding increasing the relevance of the \nresearch to policymakers in their efforts to reduce poverty.  First, there was the need to develop \nan  effective  mechanism  for  continued  interaction  among  researchers,  policy  advisors,  and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila. ", "  Appendix 4  41 \ndecision makers. This demand-driven need comes from both the researchers and policymakers.  \nResearchers demand the network because they often lack full understanding of key agricultural \npolicy issues, and of the political constraints under which agricultural policy decisions are made. \nPolicymakers  demand  this  mechanism  because  the  agricultural  policy  research  produced \ncontinues to be abstract and does not meet the information needs of the decision maker. In \nresponse to this demand, IFPRI filled the vacuum by developing PAANSA, a network of policy \nresearchers and decision makers who come from institutions within the government (planning or \npolicy analysis units of ministries of planning/ economic development/agriculture) and outside \nthe government and meet formally to exchange research information and feedback on research \nneeded to address poverty reduction. Since PAANSA is demand-driven, and local researchers \nand policymakers are partaking in activities without monetary incentives, it is expected that the \nmechanism will remain active upon the withdrawal of IFPRI after 5 years of intense involvement \nand  support.  Also,  linkages  between  SAI  and  other  existing  South  Asia  professional \nassociations  such  as  the  South  Asian  Network  of  Economic  Institutes,  the  Asia  Pacific \nAssociation of Agricultural Research Institutions, and the South Asian Economic Association are \nbeing explored.  Linking SAI with an existing, relevant, but not identical association will increase \nits sustainability after IFPRI. Second, the quality of policy research remains a concern, given the \nlow level of human capital available in many of these research organizations.  As a result, \ndecision makers feel reluctant to base their policy decisions on abstract or low quality research, \nand therefore there is wide gap between the researchers and policymakers. This gap needs to \nbe  bridged  in  order  for  research  to  create  an  impact  on  poverty  reduction  through  policy \nchanges. Also, improving the quality of research depends on better use of analytical tools and \nthe existing stock of human capital through collaborative research, training, and exchange \nprograms.  The  research  component  of  this  proposal  will  accomplish  this  task  through \ncollaborative  research.  Third,  to  ensure  the  sustainable  generation  of  high  quality  and \nmeaningful research for policymakers to use, there is a need for continuous strengthening of \nlocal policy research capacity.  This need will be met by this proposed TA through the training of \ntrainers in selected centers of excellence in South Asia. \n \n4.  Creating a mechanism for policy dialogue, generating high quality research information, \nand strengthening the capacity of researchers and policymakers are needed for designing and \nimplementing  appropriate  policies  and  programs  to  reduce  poverty  and  hunger.  In-country \ncapacity  to  undertake  policy  research  and  communications  among  the  policy  researchers, \nanalysts, and policymakers will help in achieving two of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable economic growth through policies and programs (pillar \n1) and facilitation of good governance through TA, capacity building, and policy dialogue (pillar \n3).   \n \n5.  This project is designed to address the above challenges by increasing policy and \ninstitutional competence for addressing the poverty reduction agenda. The collaborative policy \nresearch component aims to generate high-quality information that will result in policies and \nprograms that facilitate pro-poor, sustainable growth.  Strengthening the capacity of researchers \nand analysts in market reforms, trade, and quantitative methods will improve the quality of \nevidence-based research needed to make effective pro-poor policy decisions.  Moreover, this \nstronger capacity will allow in-country researchers to undertake research on emerging country-\nrelevant issues.  For example, market reform research could lead to policies that would reduce \ntransaction costs associated with the production and marketing of agricultural commodities, and \nultimately improve incomes.  Also, capacity in understanding markets and trade issues will lead \nto  research-based  policies  that  could  induce  private  sector  development  through  proper \ndecentralization  and  trade  policies  that  benefit  the  poor.  The  research  and  capacity-\nstrengthening components are in line with the first pillar of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. ", "42  Appendix 4 \n6.  In addition to high-quality research and strengthening capacity, good governance is \nneeded for effective policies and institutions.  One way to ensure good governance is through a \nparticipatory  process  that  involves  researchers,  policymakers,  and  policy  advisors.  The \nproposed project aims to promote better integration among policymakers and advisors in the \nministries  of  agriculture,  food,  and  finance;  planning  commissions;  policy  researchers  in \nresearch organizations; the private sector; and other stakeholders in NGOs. This process will \nlead to a better flow of evidence-based knowledge from research institutions to policymakers, \nenhancing the impact of policy decisions on reducing poverty.  This approach is in line with the \nthird pillar of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. It is also in accordance with the strategies and \npriorities of the selected countries in South Asia \n \n7.  IFPRI\u2019s consultation with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), several \nstate agricultural universities, national researchers, and policymakers highlighted the following \nthematic areas where research and capacity are needed: (i) understanding the determinants of \nagricultural growth, (ii) strengthening institutions for agricultural development; (iii) enhancing \ninput supply systems, (iv) improving water management, (v) providing rural infrastructure; (vi) \nunderstanding how agricultural markets behave under various liberalization policies, and (vii) \ngrasping the implications of WTO on Indian agriculture. Furthermore, IFPRI\u2019s memorandum of \nunderstanding with ICAR also highlights these issues in India. \n \n8.  Pakistan faces several challenges in reducing poverty and malnutrition: poor physical \ninfrastructure and facilities, fluctuations in food availability, high population growth, stagnant \nagricultural growth, and fragmented land holdings. To take advantage of the opportunities for \nreducing poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition, research and capacity strengthening are \nneeded in rural industry development, infrastructure development, land reform, credit access, \nexpansion of trade, and private sector development. The Pakistani policymakers in a regional \nmeeting of PAANSA in April 2002 highlighted these issues. \n \n9.  Bangladesh faces specific challenges: increasing inequality, inadequate mechanisms to \ncope with nutritional needs, lack of assets, lack of communication between decision makers and \nthe  poor,  ineffective  institutions,  and  polluted  groundwater.  Over  the  past  20  years,  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh has invested in infrastructure, agricultural research, and extension \nas  well  as  provided  incentives  for  private  investment  in  irrigation,  fertilizer,  and  seed \ntechnologies. These investments and policies have lead to substantial rural economic growth, \nbut poverty and food insecurity still exist. Based on IFPRI\u2019s work in collaboration with the \nMinistry of Food for the past 4 years, opportunities exist for poverty reduction through continuing \nmarket reform, diversifying agricultural production, increasing access to credit, taking advantage \nof globalization, developing pro-poor growth strategies, promoting the role of women in rural \ndevelopment, developing infrastructure, linking institutions, and inducing technical change.   \n \n10.  Nepal also faces many challenges in reducing poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition \nincluding inadequate targeting programs; centralized decision making; lack of monitoring and \nevaluation;  political  instability;  poor  social  and  economic  infrastructures;  and  low  levels  of \ntechnology,  transparency,  and  accountability.  However,  underlying  such  challenges  are \nopportunities to strengthen capacity in monitoring and evaluation, encouraging private sector \ngrowth,  involving  stakeholders  in  a  consultative  process,  increasing  smallholder  farm \nproductivity, providing access to basic services, and expanding trade opportunities.   \n \n11.  An initial consultative process under SAI on policy research priorities indicated that \nmanaging trade liberalization and market reforms to reduce poverty and achieve food security \nfor all is the major common and immediate challenge to the countries in South Asia.  This TA ", "  Appendix 4  43 \nactivity will pursue managing trade liberalization and market reforms to achieve food security \nand poverty reduction as a major thematic issue for policy dialogue, policy research, and \ncapacity strengthening of policy researchers in South Asia.   \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purposes and Outputs \n12.  This  project  aims  to  bring  together  policymakers  and  policy  researchers,  generate \ninformation  through  policy  research,  and  strengthen  local  capacity  for  policy  research  and \nanalysis in South Asia.  The objectives are (i) to create synergy among policymakers and policy \nresearchers in South Asia so they may make more rational and effective decisions to reduce \nhunger  and  poverty;  (ii)  to  conduct  quality  research  on  applied  policy  issues  for  poverty \nreduction in collaboration with local institutions and researchers; and (iii) to strengthen the \ncapacity of local institutions to carry out analytical studies and to further increase capacity for \npolicy research and analysis.   \n \n13.  There will be six major outputs from the TA: \n \n(i)  a mechanism for linking decision makers and researchers to identify emerging \npolicy research priorities and for policy dialogue;   \n(ii)  collaborative  research  studies  on  emerging  policy  issues  that  will  generate \nresearcher-based information for policy dialogue; \n(iii)  informed policy decisions based on the results of the collaborative research; \n(iv)  centers of excellence for policy research and capacity strengthening in South \nAsia;   \n(v)  a core set of training materials for strengthening the methodological, thematic, \nand communication capacities of trainers, policy researchers, and analysts in \npolicy analysis, implementation, and communication of policy recommendations; \nand   \n(vi)  sustained capacity even after the expiry of the current project through a series of \ncapacity-strengthening activities. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities    \n14.  Five main activities identified under this TA will help fulfill the above objectives and \noutputs. \n \n(i)  Four PAANSA consultative workshops will be held each year for 2 years in \nBangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan.  This activity will bring policymakers and \npolicy researchers together to discuss policy, research priorities, and results that \nwill enable policy changes (objective i in para. 12).   \n(ii)  Two policy research studies over the next 2 years will be conducted by local \nresearchers to understand the effects of trade liberalization and market reforms \non food security in Pakistan and Bangladesh (objective ii). These studies will \ncomplement similar studies being conducted in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka under \nSAI.  IFPRI will play a supervising and advisory role to the lead local researchers \nwho will be the primary authors. Other major areas of research funded by other \nagencies include:  \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \n(a)  diversification of agriculture to high-value products and agroprocessing \n(vertical integrations of farmers, processors, and retail distributions); \n(b)  water resources management; and \n(c)        agricultural technology including biotechnology. \n \n(iii)  There will be an exchange of two research collaborators over 2 years between \nIFPRI and collaborating institutions in Bangladesh and Pakistan to undertake the \nstudies mentioned above. This exchange will increase the capacity for policy \nanalysis and implementation in food production, marketing, distribution, trade, \nand consumption policies. The outputs will be jointly authored, and seminars and \ndissemination activities will be done in the country of research (objective iii).   \n(iv)  Four centers of excellence will be developed for strengthening capacity for policy \nanalysis by working with key institutions and researchers in South Asia through \noffering policy-related courses (objective iii). \n(v)  Four 1-week workshops will be held for training of trainers over 2 years.  The \nworkshops envisaged are (a) Analysis of Trade and Macro Policies for Poverty \nReduction, (b) Quantitative Methods for Policy Analysis in Crop Diversification \nand Agroprocessing, (c) Analysis of Market Reforms in South Asia for Poverty \nReduction, and (d) Communicating Policy Research (4 workshops, 2 each year) \n(objective 3).  It is expected that the trainers from the six countries will return to \ntheir countries and offer similar courses through their institutions. This model has \npaid rich dividends and helps in effective transfer of technology. The idea is to \ncreate  enough  human  capital  for  policy  research  and  analysis  through  the \ninteraction and training programs, such that the local collaborators will be able to \ncarry on with research and training even after the formal collaboration is over. \nThe TA framework described above is given in Table A4.1. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost for SAI is estimated at  $1,352,224. It is proposed that ADB provide a \ngrant of $567,500 for this TA, equivalent to 42% of the project cost. The remaining 58% will be \nfinanced  by  the  Ford  Foundation  ($250,012),  IFPRI  ($257,000),  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID)-Global Bureau ($110,746), USAID-Delhi Office ($99,973.9), \nand the European Commission ($67,019). The cost estimates and financing plan are given in \nTable A4.2. IFPRI has deliberately avoided asking the recipient countries for explicit financial \ncontributions  for  this  program,  since  they  already  contribute  to  IFPRI  core  accounts.  For \nexample, in 2001, the  Government of India gave over $30,000 to IFPRI. Further, the local \ncollaborating institutions contribute their staff time for their work under SAI, while funds from the \nproject  are  used  to  cover  the  research  costs.  Also,  IFPRI  has  signed  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with key institutions in the region such as the Indian Council of Agricultural \nResearch and the Bhutan Ministry of Agriculture to ensure their in-kind contributions to the \nactivities of SAI. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements  \n16.  IFPRI will be the Executing Agency for this proposed TA, collaborating with several \ngovernment, academic, and nongovernment institutions.  \n \n17.  IFPRI has considerable experience in implementing ADB RETA activities. Two senior \nresearchers of IFPRI will lead the project activities\u2014the director of the Markets and Structural \nStudies Division as the international expert on strategic alliances for policy impact (2 months per ", "  Appendix 4  45 \nyear for 2 years), and the head of the Strategic Training and Policy Communication Program (2 \nmonths per year for 2 years)\u2014with the assistance of a full-time senior research assistant (10 \nmonths per year for 2 years). IFPRI will be responsible for the development of PAANSA; \nimplementing,  supervising,  and  advising  the  collaborative  research  studies  on  trade \nliberalization, market reforms, and food security that will be carried out in collaboration with and \nBangladeshi  and  Pakistani  institutes;  coordinating  the  capacity  strengthening  activities  in \nBangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, the visitor exchange program (2 visits each year for 2 \nyears),  and  carrying  out  three  short-term  thematic  and  methodological  workshops  and  a \nworkshop on policy communications.   \n \n18.  The  Nepal  Agriculture  Research  Centre;  Tribhuvan  University,  Nepal;  the  Pakistan \nInstitute of Development Economics; and Lahore University of Management Sciences, Pakistan \nwill  collaborate  on  policy  research  and  in  implementing  the  workshop  on  Trade  and \nMacroeconomics Policies for Poverty Reduction.  \n \n19.  The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, New Delhi; ICAR; \nand the Centre for Economic and Social Change, Hyderabad will be the collaborating institutes \nin  India  for  policy  research,  policy  dialogue,  and  the  implementation  of  the  workshop  on  \nEconometric Analysis for Policy Formulation and Quantitative Analysis for Developing Poverty \nReduction Strategies. \n \n20.  The  Indira  Gandhi  Institute  of  Development  Research,  Mumbai,  India  will  be  a \ncollaborating institute for policy research and for implementing the workshop on Analysis of \nMarket Reforms in South Asia for Poverty Reduction. \n \n21.  The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies is the lead collaborating institute on \npolicy research in Bangladesh and for implementing the workshop on Communicating Food \nPolicy Research. The implementing and collaborating institutions and members are listed in \nTable A4.3. \n \n22.  The proposed TA will be monitored for its impact as part of IFPRI\u2019s institutionalized \nimpact assessment activities. The outputs and progress indicators will be monitored as part of \nthis impact assessment activity. The Executing Agency, in consultation with the implementing \nagencies and other stakeholders, will determine, during the first project planning workshop, the \nschedule of activities, the key milestones, and clearly measurable performance indicators and \nwill  submit  the  same  to  ADB,  immediately  thereafter.  At  IFPRI,  the  TA  will  form  a  major \ncomponent of the global and regional program titled Strategic Alliances for Policy Impact. Thus \nthe TA will be directly monitored for its contribution to poverty reduction. Further, the senior \nmanagement team of IFPRI will periodically review the progress made through the TA in terms \nof its outputs and outcomes. The quarterly progress report that will be submitted to ADB will \ninclude  indicators  of  progress.  There  will  be  several  outputs,  which  are  listed  in  the  TA \nframework  given  in  Table  A4.1.  Specifically,  the  proceedings  from  each  workshop  will  be \npublished  on  IFPRI\u2019s  website  and  disseminated  widely  to  participants  and  appropriate \npolicymakers and policy researchers in the South Asian region.  The results of the two research \nprojects will be published as IFPRI discussion papers and submitted for publication to regional \njournals for reaching wider audiences. The training manuals prepared under the TA will be used \nin SAI workshops, shared widely with the trainers in the region, posted on IFPRI\u2019s website, and \nannounced in IFPRI\u2019s training newsletter.   \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \n \nTable A4.1: Technical Assistance Framework, \nInternational Food Policy Research Institute \n \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nA.

Introduction \n1.  This project, Promoting Utilization of Indigenous Vegetables for Improved Nutrition of \nResource-Poor Households in Asia, is proposed for technical assistance (TA) as a second \nphase of the RETA 5839\u2014Collection, Conservation and Utilization of Indigenous Vegetables. A \nphase II for RETA 5839 is proposed because the wealth of materials (2,800 new accessions of \nindigenous vegetables in Asia, 50 leafy vegetables identified as promising for wider adoption \nincluding 12 accessions in three species identified as health promoting because of their high \nantioxidant activity) and related information assembled in Phase I provides a great opportunity \nto exploit a diverse array of plant species that are not well studied and yet have been part of \ntraditional agriculture for a long time and continue to be used because of their special culinary \nand nutritional value. In the proposed phase II, the materials will be evaluated for their potential \ncontribution  to  human  nutrition  and  promoted  for  inclusion  in  production  systems,  and  a \nsustainable management system will be developed to promote their conservation and utilization. \n \nB.  Issues \n2.  The TA will address the problem of food security, particularly nutritional security and loss \nof biodiversity, through promotion of utilization of indigenous vegetables. Indigenous vegetables \ncan alleviate the micronutrient deficiency that afflicts more than two billion people worldwide; the \nmild vitamin A deficiency in 40 million preschool children; as well as the iron deficiency that \nafflicts  about  1.5  billion,  particularly  pregnant  women  and  children.  Nutritionists  and  social \nscientists believe that integration of food rich in micronutrients, like vegetables, in the diet is the \nonly sustainable way to improve micronutrient status in the human body. Vegetables can also \nprovide additional health benefits as good sources of antioxidants, which counteract oxidants\u2014  \nhighly reactive compounds that can sequester metabolites that cause damage in cells, which \nmay lead to disease. \n \n3.  Malnourished workers have lower productivity, which hampers overall economic growth. \nA healthy diet can improve productivity. A study conducted by Dr. Katinka Weinberger of the \nAsian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC), in collaboration with the India \nNational Agricultural Research System (NARS), on 5,800 rural laborer households shows that \nwage levels would rise an average of 3.5\u20135.5% if households consumed recommended levels \nof micronutrients, such as iron and vitamin A. This positive effect on income was significant and \nsurprisingly large compared with the return associated with increasing primary education. \n \n4.  Despite the recognized importance of indigenous vegetables in supplementing the food \nand nutritional needs of people, they are underutilized. Possible reasons are lack of available \ngermplasm for widespread use, lack of seeds, lack of information on use and importance, lack \nof information about their performance and input requirements, and lack of information on how \nthey can fit into production systems. Unlike the major cultivated species such as cabbage, \ntomato, pepper, and eggplant, whose improvement and seed production are taken care of by \nthe private sector as well as by government institutions, indigenous vegetables are a neglected \nlot.  National programs tend to put priority on new high-yielding improved varieties of a few crop \nspecies. The underutilization of indigenous vegetable is also endangering genetic resources.  \nDisuse along with the pressures of development, increasing population, and vigorous marketing ", "  Appendix 5  55 \nof modern cultivars, representing only a few species by seed companies, are resulting in the \nrapid  disappearance  of  local  varieties  and  indigenous  species  that  may  carry  valuable \ncharacteristics and contribute to the country\u2019s biodiversity. \n \n5.  Phase I of RETA 5839 addressed the issue of food and nutritional security and loss of \nbiodiversity.  It  assembled  more  than  2,500  accessions  of  indigenous  vegetables.  These \ngermplasm materials are conserved at AVRDC and in the genebanks of its member countries. \nIn addition to the activities in Asia, AVRDC has complementary activities on leafy vegetables in \nAfrica, done in collaboration with the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) \nand the German Technical Assistance. AVRDC also has collaborative activities with the Council \nof  Agriculture,  Taipei,China  on  the  indigenous  vegetables  of  Taipei,China.  The  available \nmaterial for utilization is therefore expected to reach more than 3,000 accessions. The new \nmaterials will increase the collection available at AVRDC to more than 6,000. \n \n6.  After 2\u00bd years of implementation, 50% of the collected material has been regenerated \nand characterized through the project. Seeds of these are available for further evaluation.  \nCharacterization data served as the basis for preliminary selection, and about 50 accessions of \nleafy  vegetables  have  been  identified  as  promising  for  wider  adoption  and  are  ready  for \nevaluation in the periurban production system and for national preferences in the Philippines \nand Thailand. A selection of Amaranthus sp. from Indonesia was found to have a very rapid \ngrowth  phase  and  can  yield  twice  as  much  as  the  popular  pale  green  amaranth.  Four \naccessions of Amaranthus were identified as promising for use as sprouts.  Evaluation for \nethylene sensitivity, which is associated with longer shelf-life, and photoperiod sensitivity is also \nbeing  done.  The  NARS  in  Thailand  has  identified  four  promising  accessions  of  basil  for \ncommercial production. \n  \n7.  The project also provided training to NARSs. A total of 29 person-months of training at \nAVRDC headquarters was provided to eight national staff.  Hands-on training in exploration and \ncollecting indigenous vegetable germplasm was also given to five national staff from each of the \nparticipating  countries.  The  training  strengthened  skills  in  germplasm  documentation,  seed \npreservation, germplasm characterization, and evaluation including molecular characterization \nand  biochemical  evaluation.  These  are  skills  necessary  to  conserve  indigenous  vegetable \ngermplasm and enhance their utilization. \n \n8.  However, the work is incomplete if it stops at assembly, conservation, and preliminary \nevaluation  of  the  collected  material.  Utilization  has  to  be  promoted  and  sustainable \nmanagement system developed to promote conservation and utilization. \n \n9.  Other countries not directly involved in the first phase of the project have signified \ninterest and would like to join the collaborative activity. In 24\u201326 September 2001, the Forum of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-AVRDC Regional Network (AARNET) on \nVegetable Research and Development was held. AARNET is a country initiative meant to \npromote sustainable and improved production of quality and safe vegetables, especially in the \nurban areas, and to enhance vegetable research and development cooperation in the ASEAN \nregion in collaboration with AVRDC. One of the projects discussed and approved by the ASEAN \ncountry ministries, leading to collaborative efforts, was Collection, Conservation and Evaluation \nof Indigenous Vegetables in the ASEAN. This was in recognition of the need to improve the \ncollection, conservation, and utilization of indigenous vegetables in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, and Myanmar. The countries were chosen on the basis that \nthey are within the area where genetic erosion is fast taking place. One of the constraints \nidentified in the implementation of the activities on collection and evaluation of indigenous ", "56  Appendix 5 \nvegetables in ASEAN is the lack of financial support.  It was therefore suggested that request \nfor a phase II of RETA 5839 include complementary activities in other ADB developing member \ncountries (DMCs) not covered by phase I, viz. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Malaysia. Myanmar \nand Brunei will join the collaborative activity on indigenous vegetables but will get their funding \nelsewhere. \n \n10.  Under  the  proposed  project,  evaluation  and  promotion  for  utilization  of  indigenous \nvegetables will be pursued. In the proposed phase II, eight Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nDMCs will participate in the project\u2014Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet \nNam are participants in phase I.  Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Malaysia are members of AARNET, \nand the former two are part of the Hanoi Periurban Project of AVRDC.  Coordination of activities \nin these countries will be easier, and the chances of success are high. \n \n11.  This project is part of the global effort to face the challenge of poverty, dwindling natural \nresources, food security, and health. The proposal is in line with the Global Plan of Action for \nthe  Conservation  and  Sustainable  Utilization  of  Plant  Genetic  Resources  for  Food  and \nAgriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It complements the \nproposed Global Challenge Program of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural \nResearch on Global Genetic Resources: Conservation Management and Improvement for Food \nand  Nutritional  Security,  Agrobiodiversity  and  Sustainable  Livelihood;  and  the  Challenge \nProgram of IPGRI, AVRDC, and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry \nAreas on Underutilized Crops to Enhance Nutrition and Diversification of income. \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Purpose and Outputs \n12.  The purpose of the proposed TA is to promote food security and good health in rural \nhouseholds of Asia.  The TA will improve the nutrition of resource-poor households in Asia \nthrough enhanced utilization of indigenous vegetables. \n \n13.  The  expected  outputs  are  (i)  maintenance  of  collected  germplasm  and  related \ninformation to support research and utilization strengthened in the five participating countries of \nphase 1 and collection of indigenous vegetable germplasm promoted in three new participating \nDMC's; (ii) a participatory approach to select accessions of indigenous vegetables for utilization \ndeveloped and applied; (iii) nutritional value of selected accessions of indigenous vegetables \nevaluated; (iv) women members of households empowered through training in home gardening \nschemes, seed production, and nutrition education; and (v) utilization of indigenous vegetables \nin  the  school  garden  curriculum  of  elementary  schools  in  selected  pilot  countries \ninstitutionalized.  \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n14.  Under the project, the maintenance of over 3,000 collected germplasm accessions and \nrelated  information  will  be  strengthened  to  support  research  and  utilization.  The  following \nactivities undertaken in phase I will be implemented in the new member countries: (i) collecting \nof indigenous vegetable germplasm, their characterization, conservation, and multiplication for \nexchange and utilization; and (ii) training in genetic resources conservation and evaluation.  The \ntarget  is  collection  of  500  new  accessions  from  each  of  the  new  participating  countries.  \nEvaluation to identify promising selections will be intensified. Because of the strong individual ", "  Appendix 5  57 \npreferences  that  operate  in  the  choice  of  vegetables  to  grow,  market,  and  consume,  a \nparticipatory approach to the selection of species and lines within species will be developed for \nindigenous vegetables. Selection criteria will be identified and applied in the identification of \nselections for promotion. This will be complemented with evaluation for Vitamin A, iron, and \nantioxidant activity. A household-based seed production scheme will be developed for sustained \nuse of indigenous vegetables. Women will be trained in home gardening, seed production, and \nnutrition. Observations during collecting expeditions in Phase I showed that women play a major \nrole in home gardens. Dr. Weinberger of AVRDC found that women-headed households in India \nhad better diets than male-headed households. As women show greater concern for the diets of \ntheir families, they seem to be a receptive audience for nutrition education. The use of school \ngardens as a vehicle to promote use of indigenous vegetables and improve the health of \nschoolchildren will be assessed.  The expertise of each participating NARS will be tapped in the \nimplementation of the project. Success of the project is dependent on continued government \nsupport to germplasm conservation and utilization; effective design of evaluation schemes; \nwilling participation of growers, vendors, and consumers in the evaluation process; willingness \nof women members of households to undergo training; and commitment of selected schools to \nthe garden project. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the proposed project, including contingencies, is estimated at $3.0 \nmillion equivalent.  It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $1.0 million to finance about 33% \nof the total cost of the study. The remaining 67% will be financed by AVRDC ($1.0 million), and \nNARSs ($1.0 million equivalent). NARSs will provide mostly in-kind contribution through local \nstaff, research laboratory, office, and training facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Table A5.2. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  AVRDC, which has performed satisfactorily in implementing the phase 1 project will \nserve as the Executing Agency for the proposed project.  It will administer and coordinate the \nproject through its headquarters located in Shanhua; Tainan; Taipei,China. Each participating \nNARS will designate a national project manager to implement the study and prepare reports.  \nThe project will link with other AVRDC projects on indigenous vegetables: the Manila Periurban \nProject, the Hanoi Periurban Project, the AVRDC-Agriculture Research Center school garden \nproject in Thailand, AARNET, and the AVRDC Africa Regional Center project with IPGRI on \nAfrican  leafy  vegetables.  It  will  also  link  with  related  current  activities  of  NARSs,  e.g., \nDevelopment of Production Strategies for Biointensive Home Gardens (Philippines) and the \nschool garden projects in Thailand. This will promote project complementarity and synergy. \n \n17.  Backstopping by AVRDC will be provided in germplasm collecting, characterization, \nmultiplication, and conservation as well as participatory evaluation, nutritional analysis, and \nsocioeconomic analysis.  A consultant who will act as project manager will be hired.   \n \n18.  The project will be implemented over 3 years (2002\u20132004). The Executing Agency, in \nconsultation with the implementing agencies and other stakeholders, will determine, during the \nfirst  project  planning  workshop,  the  schedule  of  activities,  the  key  milestones,  and  clearly \nmeasurable performance indicators; and will submit the same to ADB immediately thereafter. \nAVRDC  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual  progress  reports,  semiannual  financial  statements \naccounting for the TA funds, and the audited financial statements. Funds will be drawn down \nevery 6 months based on AVRDC\u2019s estimate of the 6 months\u2019 activities, subject to satisfactory ", "58  Appendix 5 \nliquidation of expenditures every 6 months. AVRDC will submit a comprehensive TA completion \nreport to ADB within 3 months of completion of the project. \n \n19.  At ADB, the project will be assigned to a project officer with appropriate expertise in the \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department\u2019s  Agriculture,  Natural  Resources  and \nSocials Sectors Division. The project officer will monitor the progress of implementation and will \nconduct reviews as appropriate. \n \n20.  Results from the TA will be disseminated through capacity building and training of \nresearchers,  participating  women,  teachers,  and  schoolchildren  during  TA  implementation.  \nThrough a participatory approach, farmers and consumers of vegetables will directly evaluate \nindigenous vegetables for utilization. A socioeconomic survey and analysis will be conducted to \nevaluate the outcome of training of women. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  59 \nTable A5.1: Technical Assistance Framework, \nAsian Vegetable Research and Development Center \n \n       \n  Performance    Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nA.
