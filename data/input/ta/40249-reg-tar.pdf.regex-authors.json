The 1997\u20131998 financial crisis was a major setback in the development of several \nemerging East Asian economies.1 In the aftermath, growth plummeted and poverty indicators \ndrastically increased in the crisis-affected economies. The region, however, used the crisis as \nan opportunity to address deep-rooted economic problems. Emerging East Asian economies \nembarked on financial sector restructuring, instituted reforms in trade and the corporate sector, \nand strengthened their focus on governance issues and institutional reforms. Ten years after the \ncrisis, economic dynamism has returned to East Asia, although pre-crisis levels have not been \nreached in several areas. For example, average growth in gross domestic product (GDP), while \ngenerally robust, still has not risen to the peaks of the mid-1990s. In addition, investment \nremains weak throughout most of the region, although the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nViet  Nam,  and  some  other  economies  are  notable  exceptions.  Nevertheless,  the  region \ncontinues to be viewed as a successful development model that inspires several of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) developing member countries (DMC). \n \n2.  East Asia is back on track, though with some new dimensions. While Japan recovered \nfrom  a  decade  of  stagnant  growth,  and  PRC  emerged  as  a  major  economic  power, \nunprecedented interest in economic regionalism2 ensued as crisis-affected economies sought to \nbuild appropriate responses to new challenges. Despite the diversity across the region in terms \nof  economic  structures,  income  levels,  and  resource  endowment,  East  Asian  economies \nrealized that strengthening ties with each other and exploring regional initiatives provide a new \nplatform for the overall development process\u2014one that helps build and reinforce economic \nresilience and sustainability, and works toward the ultimate goal of poverty reduction. The \nbenefits of economic regionalism are being appreciated not only in terms of reducing costs and \nimproving quality through larger markets and economies of scale, but also with a growing \nunderstanding that this dimension offers a unique opportunity for creating new regional public \ngoods. Prompted by the crisis, Asian regionalism is emerging through government-led initiatives \nand market-driven developments, offering new perspectives on the development process. An in-\ndepth analysis of the evolution of East Asian economies 10 years after the crisis\u2014applying a \nforward-looking  approach  focused  on  the  emergence  of  regionalism\u2014will  increase \nunderstanding of the evolutionary nature of regional growth and development patterns, and offer \nrelevant lessons to a wide range of DMCs. \n \n3.  This regional technical assistance (RETA), to be managed by the Office of Regional \nEconomic  Integration  (OREI),  is  a  joint  effort  of  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  departments  [Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  Institute  (ADBI),  Economic  Research  Department  (ERD),  OREI,  and \nRegional Sustainable Development Department (RSDD)], in close collaboration with regional \ndepartments as well as other departments. The RETA will analyze the progress made in the \npast 10 years by East Asian economies, focusing on the emerging regionalism, with the aim of \nproviding relevant lessons to other DMCs. The study will adopt a forward-looking assessment of \nregional development prospects in the context of a new environment characterized by several \nemerging  initiatives  for  enhancing  regional  economic  policy  discussions.3  The  technical \nassistance (TA) framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n1 Emerging East Asian economies refer to Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; \nRepublic of Korea; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Myanmar; Philippines; Taipei,China; Thailand; \nSingapore; and Viet Nam.  \n2 Economic regionalism refers to market-driven dynamism and government-led initiatives focused on economic \nissues related to the region. \n3 The TA concept paper was cleared on 6 November 2006. The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on \n7 December 2006. ", "2  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The causes of the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis have been widely studied within and \noutside ADB. A decade after the crisis erupted, however, a synthesis of the lessons learned, \nstressing  how  affected  countries  turned  crisis  into  opportunity,  might  be  appropriate.  In \nparticular, the crisis triggered the emergence of economic regionalism through market-driven \ndevelopments  and  government-led  initiatives.  Because  it  offers  a  new  platform  to  sustain \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  the  emerging  economic  regionalism  deserves  full \nattention, especially from the perspective of a wide range of DMCs that are liberalizing their \nsocial and economic systems, and increasing their involvement in the global economy. An \nanalysis of the major dimensions that have emerged since the 1997\u20131998 crisis, focused on \neconomic  regionalism,  also  will  underline  possible  future  directions  for  the  region.  In  this \ncontext, key issues to analyze the emergence of economic regionalism include macroeconomic \nmanagement,  developments  in  the  financial  and  real  sectors,  and  social  inclusiveness  of \ngrowth.  \n \n5.  The crisis began with the sudden depreciation of the Thai baht in early July 1997, and \nspread  to  neighboring  economies  where  currencies  were  devalued  considerably  alongside \nsignificant increases in interest rates. The financial sector was identified as the immediate cause \nof the crisis. The double mismatch problem\u2014due to short-term foreign currency borrowings and \nlong-term  local  currency  lending\u2014the  presence  of  real  estate  bubbles,  and  the  one-way \nflexibility of exchange rate regimes in affected economies have been cited as major causes of \nthe  crisis.  However,  some  studies  have  pointed  out  that  declining  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness in the real sector was also an important factor behind the crisis. More efficient \nmanufacturing operations would have greatly increased resilience to the crisis and limited its \ncontagion effect within and across affected economies. Real sector weaknesses, reflected by \nfinancial sector vulnerabilities, exacerbated the extent and significance of the crisis. In addition, \nthe lack of sufficient social safety nets and other mechanisms to protect those most exposed to \nthe effects of the crisis contributed to a rapid increase in poverty, and amplified the negative \nimpact on income distribution. These are significant issues to address to improve understanding \nof the crisis, as well as to provide relevant lessons to a broad spectrum of DMCs. \n \n6.  With  East  Asian  economies  becoming  increasingly  interdependent,  the  regional \ndimension  of  macroeconomic  management  takes  on  greater  significance.  How  to  manage \nmonetary and fiscal policies, debt and international reserves, liberalization of the capital account \nin the balance of payments, and the choice of exchange rate regimes, along with how to \naddress global payments imbalances, are important issues for building economic resilience. As \nthe crisis highlighted financial sector weaknesses throughout the region, an analysis of how to \nstrengthen domestic financial systems and mobilize regional savings for regional investments \nthrough new regional initiatives has merit. Major topics include (i) financial sector regulation; (ii) \nsurveillance  and  supervision;  (iii)  continued  banking  sector  reforms;  (iv)  capital  market \ndevelopment, especially bond markets; and (v) corporate governance.  \n \n7.  Identifying ways to increase firms\u2019 productivity and competitiveness is important when \nassessing the real sector vulnerabilities that partially led to the 1997\u20131998 crisis. As firms face \nthe challenges of competing in the global economy, they need to embrace innovation, invest in \nhuman  capital,  improve  energy  efficiency,  and  introduce  environment-friendly  production \ntechnologies.  Enhancing  infrastructure  and  connectivity  is  essential  to  build  on  the  trade-\ninvestment nexus that has strengthened across East Asia during the past decade. In addition to \nthe physical infrastructure, related services that facilitate trade and drive investment also matter. \nRegional production networks now exist where locations are selected based on the availability, \ncost, and quality of production inputs, as well as on the efficiency of economic infrastructure, the ", "3 \nextent to which an economic environment is market-friendly, and the legal framework. The rapid \nincrease in intraregional trade in recent years reflects the movement of intermediate goods \nwithin these regional production networks. Thus, maintaining high levels of productivity and \ncompetitiveness is extremely important for sustaining regional development. \n \n8.  Governance reforms are needed to ensure that economic growth does not exclude the \nmost vulnerable sectors of society from social development, particularly in terms of income \ndistribution.  Poverty  reduction  requires  an  analysis  of  income  disparities,  the  demographic \nchallenges of aging societies, and ways of strengthening protection through social safety nets. \nThese  issues  are  becoming  more  relevant  as  economic  regionalism  grows,  and  they  are \nincreasingly discussed in regional policy dialogue forums.  \n \n9.  East Asia\u2019s recovery from the crisis and the new dimensions that have emerged across \nthe  region  in  the  past  decade\u2014particularly  increased  economic  regionalism\u2014pose  several \npolicy challenges. One is how to manage globalization as the region\u2019s emerging economies \nrapidly integrate into the global economy. A second is how to strengthen governance and the \ninstitutional framework. Rethinking the role of the state, and introducing appropriate public \nsector reforms, can improve real and financial sector efficiency, and enhance social sector \nprotection. A third policy challenge is how to shape a new regional economic architecture, and \nultimately move toward the creation of an Asian economic community\u2014as recently envisaged \nby Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+3 leaders4. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  This RETA aims to study the way emerging East Asian economies responded to the \n1997\u20131998 financial crisis by broadening and deepening regional cooperation and integration, \nand  by  building  a  new  platform  to  help  achieve  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n11.  The objective of the study is to enhance understanding of emerging Asian regionalism \n10 years after the financial crisis, while providing policy lessons relevant to a wide range of \nDMCs, especially those liberalizing their economic and financial systems to meet the challenges \nof globalization. By increasing the capacity to analyze the nature of the recovery from the crisis \nand the new economic regionalism dimension, the RETA will contribute to stronger policy \nmaking at the national and regional levels.  \n \n12.  A major outcome of the RETA will be the publication of a two-volume book comprising a \nsynthesis of several analytical and policy studies (volume I) and background economic papers \n(volume II). Another major output will be one or more international conference(s) to promote \ndiscussion of the issues in paras. 4 \u2013 9 to a wide range of stakeholders and media.5  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Adopting a forward-looking approach, the study conducted under this RETA will discuss \nissues related to the post-crisis East Asian economic development model. Each section will \nhighlight the emergence of economic regionalism and the relevance of policy lessons for DMCs. \nThe content of the study will be related to, but not limited to, the following topics:  \n                                                 \n4 Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n5 Given the scope of the analysis, the study conducted under this RETA will be an appropriate follow-up to ADB. \n1997.

The final report of the study will be published as a two-volume book, ideally before the \nend of 2007. The book, which will be written by a study team comprising ADB staff and \nconsultants, will synthesize analytical and policy studies (volume I) and background economic \npapers (volume II). To facilitate the preparation of the report, one international conference and \ntwo  workshops  (inception  and  report  finalization)  will  be  organized  in  2007.  The  inception \nworkshop, organized in March 2007, will serve to set up the study team, define the scope of \nwork, and assign responsibilities. The international conference, organized in early July 2007, will \nprovide an opportunity to make the study known to the public, receive feedback from a wide \nrange of individuals and institutions, and mark the 10-year anniversary of the crisis. The report \nfinalization workshop, organized in September 2007, will serve to complete the work and ensure \nconsistency  of  the  analytical  approach  and  policy  suggestions.  In  addition,  one  or  more \ninternational conference(s) addressing specific issues discussed in the report may be organized \njointly with national and international agencies to diffuse the study outcome further and receive \nfeedback from distinguished audiences. A book launch event will be organized to diffuse the \nstudy outcome properly. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The RETA will cost an estimated $980,000. The Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan, will provide a grant to finance the RETA. Details of the cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Implementing Agency and Executing Agency for the RETA, while OREI \nwill manage the RETA in collaboration with several ADB departments, especially ERD, RSDD, \nADBI, and regional departments. The RETA is expected to be carried out over 18 months from \nJanuary 2007 to June 2008. OREI will finalize the study outcome, structure, and implementation \nfollowing the advice of a steering committee and a working group composed of representatives \nfrom involved ADB departments. The steering committee will function as an advisory and quality \ncontrol body. The working group will act on more operational matters, such as specifying \ndetailed terms of reference for consultants and reviewing the draft papers prepared by the study ", "5 \nteam. Further, the working group will (i) ensure that the study is relevant to a wide range of \nDMCs; (ii) define a detailed time line for implementing the RETA; (iii) ensure that deadlines are \nfollowed; and (iv) promote participation of ADB staff in the study, especially in the preparation of \nbackground economic papers. The steering committee will supervise the finalization of these \npapers, as well as the synthesis of analytical and policy studies to be delivered by international \nconsultants. The final report outline is in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The RETA will require 30 person-months of international consulting services and 15 \nperson-months of national consulting services, as well as 1 person-month of resource persons\u2019 \nservices. The consultants will be selected and engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Participation \nin all RETA activities will be voluntary. The terms of reference for consultants and resource \npersons are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Seven  international  consultants,  who  will  be  engaged  for  approximately  15  person-\nmonths total, will write the main chapters included in volume I of the final report. A principal \nconsultant will write the introduction and conclusion chapters, and will assist OREI staff in \nconsolidating the papers produced by other consultants for the final report. A financial and \neconomic development specialist will write an overview of the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis and \nafter, focusing on the lessons from the crisis and the emergence of economic regionalism. A \nmacro-financial  expert  will  write  a  chapter  on  macroeconomic  management  in  an \ninterdependent region. A financial economist will write a chapter on the financial sector, focusing \non the initiatives and developments geared to mobilize regional savings. A productivity and \ncompetitiveness expert will write a chapter on the real sector, stressing the importance of the \ntrade-investment nexus and maintaining high levels of productivity and competitiveness in the \nregion. A social economics expert will write a chapter on the social inclusion of growth with a \nfocus on the importance of governance reforms. Finally, an international economist will write a \nchapter on policy challenges, covering issues such as managing globalization, strengthening \ngovernance  and  institutions,  and  shaping  a  new  regional  economic  architecture.  Other \ninternational consultants and resource persons will write several background economic papers \nto be included in volume II of the report, together with other background economic papers \nwritten by several ADB staff. These 10 international consultants will be engaged for a total of 10 \nperson-months. Finally, to ensure high quality of the report and the publications that will be \nproduced from it, an economics editor will be engaged for approximately 5 person-months.  \n \n19.  One national consultant, who will be engaged for approximately 12 person-months, will \nserve as the project coordinator for overall administration of the RETA. This consultant will (i) \nmaintain communication with the international consultants and resource persons, (ii) ensure the \ntimely delivery of papers, (iii) review the papers prepared for the study, and (iv) guarantee \nsmooth completion of the report and publication of the book. Another national consultant will be \nengaged for approximately 3 person-months, intermittently, as event coordinator to manage \nlogistics, organize workshops and conferences, and establish and maintain media contacts. In \naddition, approximately 10 resource persons also will be engaged for a total of 1 person-month \nto participate in the workshops and conferences as discussants, and to prepare short issue \nbriefs whenever needed. \n \nIV.
