INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) for Improving Market Linkages for \nCottage and Small Industries (CSIs) will help Bhutan develop the capacity of CSIs to gain \nexposure and profitably operate in domestic and international markets.1 The TA will support the \nGovernment of Bhutan in streamlining standardization and certification, while implementing an \nintegrated market access program to promote select CSI products. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  three  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB): addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and fostering regional cooperation and integration.  The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Bhutan.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Bhutan is one of the smallest but fastest-growing economies, with an annual average \neconomic growth rate of 7% since the late 1980s.3 Despite high growth rates, Bhutan has faced \na persistent development challenge: the economy remains relatively undiversified and heavily \nreliant on hydropower exports. CSIs account for 95% of all industries and employ an estimated \n99,228  people.4  CSIs  are  significant  because  of  their  potential  for  growth  and  economic \ndiversification.5 While CSIs are promising sources of employment and broad-based economic \ngrowth, they face a number of challenges. \n \n4.  Although CSIs are crucial to drive Bhutan\u2019s economic growth, they are prevented from \nrealizing their full potential by a poor entrepreneurship culture, limited access to finance and \neffective business development services, and weak market linkages. To gain exposure and \nsustained market access in higher-value domestic and international markets, a multipronged \napproach is required to support CSIs in certification and market access. \n \n5.  The Department of Cottage and Small Industry (DCSI), Bhutan Agriculture and Food \nRegulatory Authority (BAFRA), Department of Trade, and Bhutan Standards Bureau (BSB) are \nmandated to support CSI product standardization and certification. However, a proper institutional \nnetwork and coordination among these agencies are lacking. Fragmented strategy formulation \nand weak communication and coordination among agencies impede establishing a harmonized \nframework to standardize and certify products and set up a single-window service delivery \nsystem. \n \n6.  CSI products from Bhutan are not competitive in regional and international markets \nbecause  of  the  country\u2019s  inability  to  utilize  economies  of  scale,  high  transport  costs,  and \nunderdeveloped logistics sector. These challenges translate into higher prices for CSI products, \nmaking them uncompetitive. To capitalize on the unique features of CSI products certified under \n \n1  Cottage industries are those with investment of less than Nu1 million ($14,000 equivalent) and engaging up to four \npeople. Small industries are those engaging 5\u201319 employees, with an investment of Nu1 million\u2013Nu10 million \n($14,000\u2013$140,000 equivalent). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 September 2019. \n3  Government of Bhutan.

", "2 \nBrand Bhutan, CSIs must leverage the brand to gain exposure first and then sustained access to \nregional and international markets.6 \n \n7.  Packaging and labeling are important in influencing consumer choices and decisions. \nWhile proper packaging ensures the product\u2019s integrity and quality, consumers rely on information \non the label to understand the product\u2019s quality and value attributes. CSIs do not yet appreciate \nthe value of proper packaging and labeling and must learn to use better packaging methods to \nmeet Brand Bhutan standards and boost access to regional and international markets. \n \n8.  The government recognizes that a strong CSI base can become the bedrock of economic \ndevelopment. Recognizing the importance of CSIs, the government approved a Nu1.2 billion \nflagship program ($16 million equivalent) for CSI development in the 12th Five Year Plan.  The \nprogram aims to promote high-growth-potential CSIs to enable them to create a competitive niche \nin regional and international markets, and to mainstream CSIs into the economy (footnote 5). To \nhelp the government achieve the program\u2019s intended results, all possible support must be \nleveraged to consolidate these results and fill in the missing links. \n \n9.  In 2007, ADB supported the CSI sector through the Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized \nEnterprise  Development  Program,  which  carried  out  policy  reforms,  stimulated  credit,  and \nsupported business development services.7 The TA provides continuity and reflects lessons from \nprojects  supported  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction\u2014Advancing  Economic \nOpportunities for Women and Girls and Decentralized Coordination and Partnerships for Gender \nEquality Results\u2014in terms of (i) concerted efforts from agencies mandated to improve market \nlinkages for self-help groups\u2019 products; and (ii) emphasis on product design, packaging, and \nlabeling to gain access to higher-value markets.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: increased contribution of CSIs to gross \ndomestic product and employment (footnote 4).9 The TA will have the following outcome: CSIs\u2019 \naccess to higher-value domestic and international market improved.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: National framework for CSI product standardization and certification \nestablished.  To  achieve  this  output,  a  participatory  baseline  assessment  of  institutional \ncapacities will be conducted to establish a national product certification system and to provide \ncertification services from a single window. Based on the assessment, the TA will (i) support the \n \n6  Brand Bhutan is a certification process under the Department of Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs for products that \nreflect the values of Bhutan\u2019s society and history and the Gross National Happiness philosophy.  \n7  ADB. 2007.

Output 2: CSI products promoted using Brand Bhutan. The DCSI intends to use Brand \nBhutan to promote CSI products. The output comprises two components: \n \n(i)  Promote select domestic and export-oriented CSI products using \u201cMade in \nBhutan\u201d and\u201d Grown in Bhutan\u201d labels of the Brand Bhutan strategy. For \ngender mainstreaming, the TA will focus on three types of products in which \nwomen\u2019s  involvement  is  strong:  high-end  agricultural  products  (peanuts, \ndehydrated fruits, honey, and red rice); medicinal and aromatic plants (Sichuan \npepper and caraway); and textiles and crafts (tourist souvenirs, including traditional \npaintings using natural pigments, home decor, scarves, and shawls). Agro-based \nproducts under the One Village One Product initiative supported by the Queen\u2019s \nProject  Office,  and  products  with  strong  market  potential  under  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency\u2019s Decentralized Hands-On Program Exhibition \nwill also be promoted.13  \n(ii)  Raise awareness of Brand Bhutan among CSI entrepreneurs and build their \ncapacity to acquire certification. The TA will support targeted awareness and \nregistration in countries offering the best opportunities for trade and e-trade. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Integrated  market  access  program  to  promote  select  CSI  products \ndesigned and implemented. The TA will support CSIs in accessing domestic, regional, and \ninternational markets by (i) establishing a market improvement center focusing on product design, \npackaging, and labeling; (ii) developing the capacity of 100 CSI start-ups and business owners in \nproduct packaging and labeling, including hand-holding support during one cycle of product \nplacement.14 Priority will be given to products in output 2. To help develop the capacity of the \nDCSI, the TA will (i) train assigned DCSI officials (including economic development officers) in \nbusiness  development  services  (e.g.,  business  mentoring,  marketing,  project  proposal \npreparation); and (ii) support the development of the DCSI\u2019s online business development service \nportal. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff (including secretarial services as required), office \naccommodation  and  supplies,  furniture  and  utilities,  domestic  transport,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n \n11 Capacity development programs for the BSB will ensure that the agency can certify CSI products per the International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) product certification system. \n12 The government will provide capital-intensive equipment facilities while the TA will provide simple equipment for CSI \nproduct testing and certification for training. \n13 The One Village One Product initiative was supported by ADB. 2016.

ADB will administer the TA and ADB\u2019s South Asia Department will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the consultants. \n \n16.  The DCSI will be the TA executing agency. A small project management unit will be \nestablished within the DCSI to carry out day-to-day TA implementation. The Programming \nDivision and Enterprise Development Division, in coordination with the project management unit, \nwill work with the TA consultants to support two-way knowledge transfer though on-the-job \ntraining for DCSI staff members and the documenting of best practices in consulting reports, \nguidelines, and templates.
