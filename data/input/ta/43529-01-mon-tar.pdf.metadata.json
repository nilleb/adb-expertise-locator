INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will help the Government of Mongolia use information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) tools to improve urban transport services in Ulaanbaatar, the \ncapital of Mongolia.1 The TA supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Urban \nTransport  Development  Project2 and  is  financed  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund. The municipal government of Ulaanbaatar (MGU) requested ADB \nassistance to develop the policies, strategy, and technical specifications and to advise on \nappropriate technical solutions for ICT system installation. ADB undertook a fact-finding mission \nin October 2009 and an understanding was reached with the Ministry of Finance and MGU, the \nexecuting agency, on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, costs and financing, implementation \narrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia has experienced rapid urbanization over the last decade\u2014more than 60% of \nthe  country\u2019s  population  currently  resides  in  Ulaanbaatar.  Serious  urban  development \nchallenges now face Ulaanbaatar, including insufficient transport infrastructure and poor quality \nof public transport services and management. Investments in urban transport infrastructure, \nmanagement, quality of services, and road safety have significantly lagged behind the pace of \nurbanization. As a result, the city is suffering from heavy road congestion, insufficient traffic \nmanagement,  poor  safety  conditions,  and  a  weak  public  transport  system.  These  factors \ncontribute to economic inefficiency because of increased trip times, excessive fuel use, and \npoor air quality, which all diminish the quality of life. Without a viable public transport system, \nUlaanbaatar will soon experience even more serious traffic congestion which will negatively \naffect economic development and quality of life.  \n \n3.  Efficient  public  transport  management  institutions  with  clear  mandates  and  strong \ncapacity  are  required  to  implement  investments,  attract  financing,  coordinate  among \nstakeholders, and regulate service providers. The institutional capacity of MGU needs to be \nimproved  with  regard  to  (i)  development,  implementation,  and  enforcement  of  the  urban \ntransport policy and strategy; (ii) long-term investment planning, capital budgeting, and financial \nmanagement; and (iii) the design and management of urban transport projects financed by \ninternational development partners and private sector investors.  \n \n4.  Financial management of the public transport sector is one of the key areas requiring \nurgent  assistance.  Bus  fares  have  not  been  increased  since  1999  while  fuel  costs  have \nincreased more than five times during the same period. The municipal budget subsidizes about \n42% of the bus companies\u2019 annual costs, but the mechanism for allocating subsidies does not \naccount for actual passenger ridership and is inefficient. Bus operators do not have the financial \nresources to renew and expand their bus fleet and provide adequate transportation services. \nInteraction among the different modes of public transport is far from optimal. More than 20% of \nthe  city\u2019s  budget  is  spent  on  subsidizing  the  bus  expenditures  of  elderly  people,  military \npersonnel, and students. The bus fare compensation system is inefficient because the amount \nof  compensation  is  based  on  assumptions  of  passenger  flow  and  does  not  reflect  actual \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 April 2010. \n2  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Preparing the Urban Transport Development Project. Manila. \nADB is planning to finance the Urban Transport Development Project in Mongolia in 2011. The project aims to \nimprove public transport services in Ulaanbaatar by introducing a bus rapid transit system and improving public \ntransport management. \n ", "2   \npassenger numbers. This is exacerbated by illegal free riders using copied or fake identification \ndocuments. In addition, high levels of spending on public transport subsidies crowd out limited \nresources  from  other  important  city  budget  priorities  such  as  education  and  public  health \nprograms. Thus, improving the efficiency and management of the public transport system would \nbring wide-ranging benefits in multiple sectors in Ulaanbaatar. The success and sustainability of \nthe proposed Urban Transport Development Project largely depends on effectively addressing \nthe  inefficient  revenue  collection  and  passenger  subsidy  systems  and  the  uncoordinated \noperating environment of the existing public transport system. The TA will build on the ongoing \ntechnical  assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Preparing  The  Urban  Transport  Development  Project \n(footnote 2) and ensure that (i) the above issues are addressed in detail, (ii) the cost estimates \nfor the proposed ICT investments under the Urban Transport Development Project are accurate \nand financially viable, and (iii) a well-conceived plan for implementing these improvements is in \nplace before the Urban Transport Development Project is implemented. \n \n5.  Urban sector development, including urban transport infrastructure and services, is one \nof  the  key  sectors  for  ADB  assistance  in  Mongolia.  ADB  has  provided  support  to  the \ngovernment  for  urban  sector  development  since  1998.  The  Mongolia  country  operations \nbusiness plan for 2009\u201320123 includes the Urban Transport Development Project in the 2011 \npipeline. The TA will help the project employ integrated ICT solutions to improve public transport \nmanagement  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  proposed  TA  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  development \nstrategy and road map for the country as well as the sustainable transport action plan, which \naims to address transport needs and provide support to the transport sector in developing \nmember  countries  and  thereby  reduce  adverse  environmental  and  social  externalities \nassociated with transport.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The  TA  will  introduce  integrated  circuit  card  (ICC)  ticketing  and  automatic  vehicle \nlocation (AVL) systems that will improve the quality, efficiency, and transparency of the public \ntransport sector. The systems will (i) establish a transparent and accountable ICT system for \npassenger ticketing based on a smart-card system; (ii) optimize use of resources by eliminating \nillegal free riding; (iii) install an efficient ICT-based financial management system; and (iv) \nrationalize bus routing, dispatching, and scheduling based on actual passenger demand and \nobserved travel patterns. The proposed AVL system, which will be based on global positioning \nsystem technology, will help the public transport management body to (i) locate buses en route \nin real time, (ii) automatically detect deviations from schedule and allow operators to respond to \ndeviations by holding buses or dispatching additional buses, (iii) develop and implement more \nefficient bus operating schedules, and (iv) transmit real-time information about bus locations to \npassengers  and  bus  operators.  Introducing  these  systems  requires  careful  planning  and \nmeticulous preparatory work, including (i) establishment of a system management body, (ii) \ndevelopment of a financing mechanism, (iii) integration of the fare collection system of multiple \nbus operators, (iv) design of bus passenger services based on bus location data, and (v) \ndevelopment of a staged implementation program. \n  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA is improved quality of public transport services in Ulaanbaatar. The \noutcome of the TA is improved capacity of MGU to render public transport services using up-to-\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009.
