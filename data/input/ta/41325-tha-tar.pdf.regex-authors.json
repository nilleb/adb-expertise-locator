The Government of Thailand has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) for supporting more balanced development of the Thai capital \nmarket, increasing the range and sophistication of financial products, and strengthening the \nexisting  institutions  and  policy  framework\u2014making  the  Thai  capital  market  more  efficient, \ncompetitive, financially sound, and responsive to global trends.  \n \n2.   The  2007\u20132011  country  partnership  strategy1  identifies  capital  market  development \namong the core areas of cooperation between Thailand and ADB, and it is a top priority on \nThailand\u2019s domestic economic agenda. The TA project is included in the TA pipeline for 2008.2 It \nis the second of four TA projects expected for Thailand over the medium term to deepen bond \nand equity markets, broaden the investor base, strengthen financial stability, and enhance risk \nmanagement practices in the financial sector. This TA project aims to build on previous ADB \nadvisory TA that addressed weaknesses in important areas of capital market operations, and \nlaid the groundwork for the capital market to play an even stronger role in supporting Thailand\u2019s \neconomic development. A reconnaissance mission from ADB visited Bangkok, Thailand from 26 \nMarch to 1 April 2008 to discuss the desired focus and expected results of the TA with the \nGovernment and other key stakeholders. This report reflects the findings of the mission and the \nunderstandings reached with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While  the  capital  market  has  grown  substantially,  loans  from  financial  institutions \ncontinue to be the major source of private sector financing. As of 2007, bank financing to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) amounted to 86% while equities market capitalization was 71% and the \nbond market 54%. Thailand market capitalization ($203 billion) ranks far below Hong Kong, \nChina ($2,177 billion); Republic of Korea ($960 billion); Singapore ($486 billion); and Malaysia \n($290 billion). Share turnover velocity (71%) compares closely with Singapore (77%) but is \nbelow that of the Republic of Korea (195%) and Hong Kong, China (99%). Secondary trading of \nstocks by retail investors represents about 54% of daily trading value. Despite the high level of \nactivities in the secondary market, the investor base is still restricted to about 480,000 individual \nbrokerage accounts and about 80,000 accounts for mutual funds\u2014representing only 2% of the \ntotal  population.  The  institutional  investor  base  is  still  underdeveloped.  The  Government \nrecognizes that the Thai capital market needs to increase the range and sophistication of \nfinancial products, and to strengthen the existing institutions and policy framework. The capital \nmarket investor base, comprising both institutional and retail investors, needs to be broadened \nfurther. Improved access to debt, equity, and risk management products is required to support \nhigher levels of economic growth and investment.  \n \n4.  The TA report for supporting implementation of the capital market development master \nplan3 was submitted to the Government in November 2007 and was received very well. Many of \nthe report\u2019s recommendations have been, or are, in the process of implementation. The very \nsatisfactory implementation of that TA has enhanced the value of ADB interventions in the \nfinancial sector/capital markets in Thailand and encouraged the Government to request further \nTA  to  lead  to  more  balanced  development  of  the  Thai  capital  market  and  make  it  more \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2007.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for Supporting the Implementation of the Capital \nMarket Development Master Plan. Manila. \n ", "2 \ncompetitive internationally. In this context, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Bank of \nThailand (BOT) have requested expanded TA to cover some of the more difficult practical \naspects of the implementation program and to build on progress already made. They wish to \nbuild  professional  capacity  within  their  institutions  to  implement  these  reforms  and  have \nrequested focused assistance in the following areas. \n \n5.  Public Debt Management Office. A key amendment to the Public Debt Management \nAct (2007) allows the Government to issue government debt for bond market development \npurposes, regardless of the budget position. Surplus cash flow from issuance will be placed in a \nbond market development fund, which needs to be managed effectively to minimize the cost of \nissuance  to  the  Government.  It  is  hoped  that  the  fund  will expand  its  asset  and  liability \nmanagement capability so that it will make a return for the Government. Assistance is required \nto develop the fund\u2019s risk management and investment capacity so that fund surpluses may be \nused more constructively. Assistance is also required to develop an accounting system and \nprocedures to operate the fund on a sustainable basis. \n \n6.  Although the auction process is relatively well defined, some areas need to be further \nstreamlined. The process of debt consolidation, currently under way, needs to be undertaken \nconcurrently but gradually. This would have a positive impact on liquidity in government bond \nmarkets. Cash management practices in the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) also need \nto be streamlined. In addition, assistance is required to establish procedures for onlending and \ndevelop a framework for guarantees to state-owned enterprises and local government units. \n  \n7.  Fiscal Policy Office\u2014Capacity Building in the Bureau of Savings and Investment \nPolicy. The Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) is often required to play an advisory role in development \nof the financial sector/capital markets in Thailand. To carry out this role effectively, there is a \nneed to strengthen the technical knowledge and skills of staff in the Bureau of Savings and \nInvestment Policy to interact effectively with other relevant government agencies and market \nintermediaries  in  the  capital  market  and  to monitor  the  development  of  capital  markets  in \nThailand more constructively.  \n \n8.  Fiscal  Policy  Office\u2014Secondary  Mortgage  Corporation. This  was  set  up by  the \nEmergency Decree on Secondary Mortgage Finance Corporation B.E. 2540, 1997, as a state \nenterprise under MOF with capital of B1,000 million. Its objective was to become the Thai \nequivalent of Ginnie Mae4\u2014taking mortgages originated by the Government Housing Bank and \nother commercial banks, and securitizing them. However, Thailand has seen a relatively small \nnumber of securitization transactions as banks and finance companies identify securitization as \na last resort for raising finance. There are no balance sheet constraints, and the size of assets is \ntaken as an indicator of strength rather than weakness. Under the current scenario, there is a \nneed  to  define  the  role  of  the  Secondary  Mortgage  Corporation  (SMC)  clearly.  A  holistic \nevaluation of SMC needs to be carried out, in terms of its future positioning, shareholding and \norganizational structure, products to be offered (including credit enhancement), and building up \ninstitutional capacity to enable SMC to become a viable entity and justify its mandate in leading \nthe development of the securitization market in Thailand.  \n \n9.  Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission  (SEC)  has  worked  closely  with  the  Federation  of  Accounting  Professions  in \nimproving the Thai accounting standards, auditing standards, and code of ethics for accountants \nto align it with revised international standards. In 2006, SEC set up the International Financial \n                                                 \n4 A government corporation tasked with increasing the availability and affordability of home ownership in the \nUnited States. \n ", "         3 \nReporting Standards (IFRS) and the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) monitoring panel \nto study and express opinion on the IFRS and the ISA. SEC wishes to design procedures for an \nindependent review of audit practices adopted by auditors of listed companies, i.e., their work \nprocess and systems (including building of relevant databases, format of reporting, internal \nquality assurance system, and enforcement).  \n \n10.  The  Stock  Exchange  of  Thailand\u2014Capital  Market  Development.  To  be  globally \ncompetitive,  The  Stock  Exchange  of  Thailand  (SET)  is  pursuing  three  major  strategies \nsimultaneously:  (i)  promoting  capital  market  development,  (ii)  restructuring  SET,  and \n(iii) improving  the  exchange  alliance  with  regional  stock  markets.  ADB  is  supporting \nrestructuring of SET through the services of an international consultant, guiding the direction of \nan ongoing study. It is also supporting the exchange alliance process through regional TA \n(RETA) for enhanced cooperation among Southeast Asian equity markets.5 Thailand was a key \nplayer in setting up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Capital Market Forum \nwhose focus is mutual recognition and harmonization of standards of information disclosure, \naccounting standards, credit rating, and cross-border recognition of qualification and experience \nof market professionals, among fellow member countries. ADB is proposing to support these \ninitiatives through RETA for strengthening Southeast Asian financial markets, which is being \nprocessed. \n \n11.  In terms of capital market development, SET will play an important role as one of three \nco-secretariats of a newly formed Capital Market Development Committee.6 The committee is \nconsidering  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  and  systematic  master  plan7  for  capital \nmarkets by the end of October 2008. The plan will embrace all relevant dimensions including \nthe equity market, bond market, derivative market (including commodities), and money market. \nIt will aim to develop a comprehensive plan for the Thai capital markets for the next 10 years \n(2009\u20132018) and provide a degree of certainty to the direction of the Thai capital market, \nthereby creating more sophisticated capital markets in Thailand. Other proposed measures to \ndevelop different segments of the market will be reviewed in the process, including coordinating \nwith BOT and SEC. SET requires support for developing the master plan. \n \n12.  Bank  of  Thailand\u2014Mortgage  Insurance.  BOT  requires  assistance  to  develop  an \nefficient mortgage insurance system in Thailand to protect lenders and investors against loss \ncaused by borrower default in situations where the home value (net of foreclosure-related costs) \nis  insufficient  to  repay  the  mortgage  obligation  fully.  Thai  commercial  banks  usually  grant \nhousing loans based solely on the collateral of borrowers, within the loan-to-value limit of each \nbank. Currently, total housing loans amount to B771,142 million and have the potential to \nincrease over time, while the nonperforming loans are about B34,650 million or 4.5%. BOT is \nkeen to improve risk management in commercial banks on housing loans through mortgage \ninsurance.  \n \n13.  Bank of Thailand\u2014Exchange Control Policy. Thailand had resorted to imposition of \nvarious  capital  controls  and  measures  to  prevent  currency  speculation,  which  inevitably \nproduced a negative effect on the development of its financial and capital markets. The capital \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Supporting Enhanced Cooperation among Southeast Asian Equity Markets. \nManila.  \n6 The committee is headed by the finance minister as its chair, with the permanent secretary of MOF as its vice chair. \nIt is composed of MOF\u2019s FPO and PDMO, BOT, SEC, SET, and market players. FPO, PDMO, and SET are the co-\nsecretariat of the committee.  \n7  Given  the  changing  global  environment,  in  particular  the  financial  sector,  the  plan  developed  by  MOF  in \nDecember 2005 needs to be reviewed. \n ", "4 \ncontrols  imposed  in  December  2006  to  help  slow  the  appreciation  of  the  Thai  baht  were \ngradually recalled before BOT removed the 30% reserve requirement on unhedged short-term \ninflows in March 2008. BOT is now keen to have ADB support on how to balance the conflicting \npolicy objectives of developing Thailand\u2019s financial markets while ensuring its ability to manage \nspeculative capital inflows effectively. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The  TA  will  help  develop  a  functional  internationally  competitive  capital  market  in \nThailand. The expected outcome under the TA will be generation of secure and diverse funding \nsources that support basic capital and investment needs.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will consist of the following components: \n \n(i)  Public Debt Management Office. This component will build on work carried out \nunder  TA  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  capital  market  development \nmaster  plan  (footnote  3),  and  improve  the  structure  of  the  bond  market \ndevelopment fund and the bond issuance program under the new amendment. It \nwill  also  help  establish  the  framework  and  procedures  for  onlending  and \nguarantees to state-owned enterprises and local government units. It will assist in \ndeveloping the new framework for cash management of PDMO. This component \nwill  develop  a  debt  consolidation  and  issuance  strategy,  and  streamline \ngovernment auction processes.  \n(ii)  Fiscal Policy Office. This component will provide the following: \n(a) Support for capacity building by helping develop staff skills in FPO to \ninteract effectively with the market and monitor the development of capital \nmarkets in Thailand more constructively.  \n(b)  Support to SMC by carrying out a holistic evaluation of SMC and identifying, \nif appropriate, measures to revive SMC based on a sustainable business \nmodel.  \n(iii)  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  This  component  will  help  design \nprocedures for an independent review of audit practices adopted by auditors of \nlisted companies. Workshops will be held to train SEC on compliance with the \nIFRS and the quality control system in accordance with ISA 220 and ISQC1.8 \n(iv)  Stock Exchange of Thailand\u2014Capital market development. This component \nwill help draft a master plan to achieve the objectives identified by the Capital \nMarket Development Committee, which will include measures to (a) deepen the \nsecurities market; (b) offer high quality securities, including risk management, \nthrough new products; (c) expand the investor base and improve measures for \ninvestor protection and education; (d) improve competition and enhance market \nintermediaries and related institutions, including supporting market infrastructure, \nleading to reduced transaction costs; (e) improve regulation and coordination; \n(f) facilitate integration to global capital markets; and (g) carry forward the study \ndone under TA supporting implementation of the capital market development \nmaster plan (footnote 3) to help develop a liquid and integrated capital market \n                                                 \n8  International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 220, Quality Control for an Audit of Financial Statements and International \nStandard  on  Quality  Control  (ISQC)1,  Quality  Control  for  firms  that  perform  audit  and  review  of  financial \nstatements. \n ", "         5 \nwith a tax system that meets the needs of different market participants and \nencourages savings and investments. The tax system proposed under the TA will \nform part of the capital market master plan exercise and will develop a well-\ndefined tax implementation framework.  \n(v)  Bank of Thailand. This component will assist BOT to do the following: \n(a) Mortgage insurance. Develop an efficient mortgage insurance system to \nprotect lenders and investors against loss caused by borrower default.  \n(b)  Exchange  control  policy.  Balance  the  conflicting  policy  objectives  of \ndeveloping  Thailand\u2019s  financial  markets  while  ensuring  its  ability  to  manage \nspeculative capital inflows effectively. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost a total of $1,450,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$1,000,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will provide the remaining $450,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff and \nother support facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  Given the diversity of components (para.15), the TA will have three executing agencies \n(EAs). PDMO under MOF will be the EA for components (i), (iii), and (iv); FPO will be the EA for \ncomponent (ii); and BOT will be the EA for component (v). It is expected that coordination of the \noutputs will be achieved through the Capital Market Development Committee. \n \n18.  The TA will require 28 person-months of international consultant inputs and 13 person-\nmonths of national consultant inputs. It is expected to be implemented over 12 months, from \nJuly 2008 to June 2009. Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) because of \nthe wide diversity of expertise needed. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  The  consultants  will  be  required  to  submit  inception  and  interim  reports  within  the \ndeadline specified in the work plan agreed with ADB. Draft final reports will be submitted within \nthe deadline specified after incorporation of feedback from the EAs and ADB. Forums on capital \nmarket development for policy makers and regulators (such as MOF, BOT, and SEC, as well as \nSET,  Bond  Electronic  Exchange,  Thai  Bond  Market  Association,  and  Thailand  Futures \nExchange) and market participants (such as the issuers, financial intermediaries, and investors \nof the capital market) will be held during TA implementation. The consultants for component (iv) \nwill  present  the  TA  findings  and  the  proposed  plan  of  action  for  addressing  weaknesses \nidentified in the Thai capital market. Based on this presentation, the participants will discuss \ncourses of actions to be taken to formulate and implement the reform measures. The draft final \nreport, including a blueprint for the capital market and the sequenced action plan for undertaking \nthe required reform measures, will be submitted before a specified deadline. In parallel, the \nconsultants working on components (i), (ii), (iii), and (v) will submit separate periodic reports (to \nbe agreed during inception) to their respective EAs. The TA outputs will be published on the \nGovernment\u2019s website.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Thailand for Capital Market Development Phase II and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance     \nDesign   Indicators and/or  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nA functional, internationally  Market capitalization  Economic reports, official  \u2022 Macroeconomic \ncompetitive capital market in  increased to 150% of  statistics, and annual      stability \nThailand  GDP and bond market  reports of relevant agencies   \n  size to 100% of GDP by    \u2022 Political will and \n  2013  Perception surveys of  commitment to pursue \n  businesses  reforms and effective \nDomestic savings    implementation of TA \nincreased to 37% of  Market reports  recommendations by \nGNP by 2013, and    the Government \nforeign direct investment     \nincreased by 5% by  \u2022 Adequate resources \n2013  for implementation, \n   including mitigation \nmeasures \n \nRisks \n \n\u2022 Political instability \n \n\u2022 Resistance to reforms \nfrom vested interest \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nGeneration of secure and  Diverse range of  SEC/SET/Thailand Futures  \u2022 Strong leadership and \ndiverse funding sources that  financial products  Exchange annual reports  commitment to reforms \nsupport basic capital and  grounded on strong     \ninvestment needs.   institutional and policy  Market feedback  Risk \n  framework similar to     \n  markets in the Republic  Progress report of Capital  \u2022 Ability to coordinate \n  of Korea and Singapore  Market Development  effectively among all \n  by 2010  Committee   the agencies involved \n \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \n1.
