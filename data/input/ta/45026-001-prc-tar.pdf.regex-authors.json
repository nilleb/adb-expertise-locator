INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the annual country programming mission in December 2010, the Government of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for a study to support sustainable urban transport \nin Beijing. A fact-finding mission visited Beijing in July 2011 and reached agreement with the \nexecuting  agency  on  the  impact,  output,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangement, and terms of reference for consulting services. The TA is in the ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance  program  for  the  PRC  for  2011.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n2.  Beijing, the capital of the PRC, had 19.6 million residents in 2010 and an urbanization \nrate of 98.8%. One of the most economically advanced cities in the PRC, Beijing symbolizes the \ncountry\u2019s rapid economic growth and serves as a model of urban development. Its transport \npolicy  influences  other  large  cities  in  the  PRC.  The  magnitude  of  its  transport-related \nproblems\u2014and the implications for other large cities and for global climate change\u2014is also \nattracting considerable international attention.  \n \n3.  Rapid urbanization and motorization, combined with high population density, have led to \nserious congestion and air quality problems in Beijing. A recent study by IBM found that Beijing \nand Mexico City were the world\u2019s worst cities for traffic jams, with scores of 99 out of 100 in the \n\u201ccommuter pain index.\u201d While Beijing accounts for less than 2% of the PRC\u2019s population, it has \nmore than 10% of its vehicles.1 Per capita motor vehicle registration has surpassed the level of \nmany leading cities in the world (1.8 times the level in Paris, 2.3 times that in New York). The \nnumber of registered vehicles grew from 1 million in 1997 to 4.7 million in 2010, an average \nannual rate of 12.8%, and the number of vehicles is expected to double by 2015. \n \n4.  The adverse effect of congestion is estimated to cost the equivalent of 7.5%\u201315% of \nBeijing\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.  Congestion  and  air  pollution  costs  contribute  the  most, \nalthough climate change and accident costs are also substantial. Research has shown that \nmore than three quarters of the air pollution in Beijing comes from vehicle carbon monoxide and \nhydrocarbon emissions.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Travel  demand.  The  increase  in  travel  demand  plays  a  leading  role  in  producing \ncongestion both on the roads and in public transport in Beijing. As the population grows and \nincomes rise, people need or desire access to numerous social and economic activities, leading \nto  an  increase  in  travel  demand.  As  the  urban  environment  becomes  more  complex  and \nsprawled, average trip lengths also increase. \n \n6.  Infrastructure supply. During the past decade, the fourth, fifth, and sixth ring roads \nwere built in Beijing. These have become the backbone of Beijing\u2019s road network. However, the \nexpansion of ring roads could not cope with the increasing and induced passenger car travel \ndemand, and the ring roads have become congested during peak hours as vehicles pour into \nthe central business district. The solution\u2014to mitigate congestion by providing new roadway \ncapacity\u2014has created a vicious cycle in which new capacity soon leads to renewed congestion \nand a travel pattern that depends more on passenger cars. \n \n7.  Car ownership and dependency. Growth in Beijing\u2019s population, combined with rising \npersonal incomes, has resulted in increasing car usage and ownership. From 2003 to 2009, the \n                                                 \n1  2010. IBM Global Commuter Pain Study. \n ", "2  \nmodal share of passenger cars increased from 27.7% to 34.0%. Limitations in land use planning \nand inadequate public transport and nonmotorized transport have resulted in frequent and short \npersonal vehicle trips (2.64 trips per day in 2005, with 44% less than 5 kilometers), and rising \nprivate vehicle usage. The average annual driving distance per vehicle is 16,000 kilometers, \nwhich is slightly higher than in Los Angeles, 1.5 times higher than in London, and 2.4 times \nhigher than in Tokyo. Because of the high vehicle traffic volume in Beijing, private cars no \nlonger offer efficient mobility around the city, and the scope for finding additional space for more \nroad infrastructure is ever diminishing.  \n \n8.  Public transport operation. Public transport can play a vital role in the management of \ncongestion.  In  Beijing,  however,  public  transport  is  less  attractive  because  of  its  poor \nperformance, limited capacity, lack of network coverage and reliability, and discomfort and \ninconvenience for passengers. Although the demand for public transportation is significant, the \ncurrent public transportation system has limited capacity and is unable to increase its market \nshare.  The  lack  of  advanced  public  transport  systems,  such  as  bus  rapid  transit,  has \nexacerbated the situation. By 2009, the modal share of public transport in the central business \ndistrict was only 39%, which is much lower than in other leading cities (86% in Paris, 92% in \nNew York). \n \n9.  In December 2010, the Beijing municipal government (BMG) announced 28 new travel \ndemand management measures to reduce traffic congestion and vehicle emissions. These \nfocus on (i) introducing quantitative restrictions on vehicle ownership and peak-hour usage, \n(ii) providing  more  parking  spaces  and  park-and-ride  facilities,  and  (iii)  prioritizing  public \ntransport and road construction to address bottlenecks.2 \n \n10.  Many  of  these  recent  measures  focus  on  producing  early  or  temporary  relief  from \ncongestion. More comprehensive and long-term approaches are also urgently needed. These \nmay include congestion charging, optimizing the usage of existing infrastructure, providing good \nquality public transport to accommodate passengers diverted from private vehicle use, and \nadopting travel demand management (TDM) measures. In August 2011, Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Beijing Transport Research Center (BTRC) \nlaunched a TA project entitled Transport Demand Management in Beijing\u2014Emission Reduction \nin Transport. BTRC is the think tank of the Beijing Municipal Committee of Transportation, which \nis responsible for transport policy in the capital. The BTRC conducts studies on urban transport \ndevelopment strategy, policy, and planning in Beijing. The TA will conduct a detailed study to \nidentify at least three TDM measures for potential implementation in Beijing, and quantify the \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions that they could bring about. \n \n11.  Previous initiatives, studies, and data collection activities to address urban transport and \ntraffic management in Beijing have not been sufficiently coordinated and comprehensive to \ngenerate  integrated  solutions.  The  potential  short-  and  long-term  strategies  need  to  be \nevaluated  on  a  common  basis  to  determine  and  compare  their  likely  effectiveness.  This \n                                                 \n2  The measures include (i) restricting vehicle ownership by rationing new registrations using lotteries (the 2011 quota \nof 240,000 new registrations is a third of the 2010 level) and placing a 5-year moratorium on the acquisition of new \ngovernment vehicles (in Beijing there are 700 government vehicles, about 15% of the city\u2019s total fleet); (ii) giving \npriority to public transport and high occupancy vehicles by designating special lanes, building passenger transport \nhubs, and encouraging the use of school buses and company shuttle buses; (iii) restricting vehicle usage through \nthe use of number-plate-based traffic controls on congested roads during rush hour, and by the government using \nmodern technology such as teleconferencing to reduce travel demand; (iv) parking pricing measures and parking \nspace provision, including categorizing the city into three zones according to the traffic congestion level, and \nproviding an additional 50,000 parking spaces in downtown Beijing, 200,000 in other areas, and 30,000 at subway \nstations located outside the fourth ring road; and (v) road construction, including new tunnels in the eastern and \nwestern sections of the second ring road, and 37 kilometers of fast lanes and 200  kilometers of new roads in \ndowntown Beijing. \n ", "  3\nevaluation needs to consider a range of sustainability evaluation indicators such as emissions, \nhealth costs, and the quality of services in addition to the congestion index (which relies solely \non road speeds). The aim is to determine the individual measures and combinations that could \nprovide the basis for an effective integrated urban transport management policy and strategy for \nBeijing. \n \n12.  The TA is intended to support the BMG in finding suitable and sustainable solutions to its \nurban transport problems. In so doing, the TA will directly support the emerging urban transport \npriorities  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy.3 It is also aligned with the pillars of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,4 focusing on inclusive and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth.  The  TA  addresses  one  of  the  focus  areas  of  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan.5 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be that an energy efficient, environment friendly and intelligent \nurban transport system is developed in Beijing. This will be demonstrated by the announcement \nof the policy and strategies by the BMG, the start of planning and implementation, and the \nintroduction of sustainability indicators in the decision-making process for urban transport in \nBeijing. The outcome of the TA will be the submission of recommendations for sustainable \nurban transport policy and travel demand and traffic management strategies to the BMG.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  To  achieve  the  impact  and  outcome,  the  TA  will  (i)  produce  recommendations  for \nsustainable urban transport policy and traffic management strategies in Beijing, (ii) establish a \nBeijing urban transport policy and strategy evaluation model, and (iii) publish a knowledge \nproduct on sustainable urban transport strategy for Beijing.  \n \n15.  The TA will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, previous studies and data \nwill be reviewed, an inventory of urban transport strategies to be evaluated will be prepared, and \na detailed study approach and methodology will be designed including criteria for evaluating the \nexpected performance of the strategies. In the second phase, the existing Beijing transport \nmodel will be prepared for use by the TA, additional surveys and data collection will be designed \nand conducted, and the model and data will be used to evaluate the expected performance of \nthe strategy options for addressing Beijing\u2019s urban transport needs. In the third phase, the TA \nwill prepare case studies to elaborate on preferred strategy options, strategy recommendations \nfor consideration by decision makers, and a knowledge product for publication. \n \n16.  The Beijing Academy of Social Science (BASS) will provide the existing Beijing transport \npolicy data and the BTRC will make the Beijing transport model available. The model will be \nupdated by incorporating an additional module to simulate vehicle emissions and convert from \npeak-hour and nonpeak-hour time periods to an hour-by-hour time-dependent model. It will be \ncalibrated to test various policies and strategies. In addition to estimating speeds (the main \nindicator  currently  used),  the  model  will  measure  sustainability  indicators  such  as  energy \nconsumption, emissions, and health costs. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

Three main types of strategy options will be examined: (i) TDM strategies including \n(a) past strategies such as restricting vehicle ownership and usage, and parking pricing; and \n(b) potential new strategies such as charging schemes including congestion pricing, fuel pricing, \ndistance-based pricing, and fee and rebate schemes; (ii) infrastructure improvement strategies, \nbased on a review of Beijing\u2019s transport infrastructure development plans and identification of \nstrategy options with potential to contribute to a more sustainable balance between private \nvehicles, public transport, and nonmotorized transport, including metro development and bus \npriority  lanes;  and  (iii)  traffic  operation  improvement  strategies,  based  on  a  study  of  the \nrelationship between Beijing\u2019s road network structure and traffic congestion, and identification of \npromising improvement options such as on-ramp and off-ramp metering during peak hours. \n \n18.  For strategies that require further data, survey and analysis, or modeling, an overall \nsurvey plan, proposed modeling approaches, and analysis methodologies will be prepared. For \nTDM  strategies,  target  groups  will  be  identified  either  as  institutions  or  individuals,  and  a \nrevealed preference and/or stated preference survey will be conducted. The survey will be \ndesigned to identify the status of existing TDM measures, the level of participation by the users, \nand the requirements for further promotion of TDM measures. For infrastructure improvement \nstrategies, road and public transport inventory data will be obtained from the Beijing transport \nmodel,  and  performance  data  will  be  obtained  from  the  BTRC.  For  traffic  operational \nimprovement  strategies,  traffic  performance  data  compiled  in  the  Transportation  Model \nDepartment (TMD) of the BTRC will be analyzed to identify the recurrent bottlenecks and a site \nsurvey will be carried out to identify the operational problems for selected locations. \n \n19.  Workshops will be held toward the end of each of the three phases to consult with a \nwide  range  of  stakeholders,  partners,  and  external  experts.  The  first  and  second  phase \nworkshops will be used to review and consolidate work produced and to agree on work plans for \nsubsequent phases. The third phase workshop will consider the findings of the TA and decide \non the recommendations to propose to the BMG. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  Government  will \nprovide counterpart staff, office space with utilities and telecommunication access, materials, \ndata, and documents. \n \n21.  Additional funding is expected to be available on a grant basis from the $1.9 million \nallocation of the Climate Change Fund approved by the Climate Change Steering Committee on \n16 March 2011 for Promoting Sustainable Low Carbon Transport in Asia and the Pacific. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart staff, office space with utilities and telecommunication \naccess, materials, data, and documents, and other services to finance the total costs such as \ncost  of  utilities  for  the  consultants,  counterpart  professional  staff,  and  support  staff.  (See \nAppendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan.) \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  BASS,  a  research  institute  under  the  leadership  of  the  Beijing  Communist  Party \nCommittee and the municipality, will be the executing agency for the TA. BASS conducts \nresearch on economics, politics, culture, social coordinated development, and the long-term \nstrategic planning of the capital. The TA will be implemented over 18 months from March 2012 \nto June 2013. \n \n ", "  5\n23.  A steering committee will be established to facilitate the TA activities. Its main tasks will \nbe acquisition of necessary data from the government and its agencies, and consultations \nbetween stakeholders. BASS, the government, and the BTRC will be the main participants on \nthe  steering  committee;  other  necessary  agencies  will  be  identified  and  included  on  the \ncommittee during the TA. A coordination committee will also be formed to consolidate the \nactivities such as workshops and liaison between ADB and GIZ. The coordination committee will \ncomprise  steering  committee  representatives,  ADB,  and  GIZ.  The  steering  committee  and \ncoordination committee will work in parallel to ensure full support and assistance from the \ngovernment and relevant agencies, and to maximize the cooperation between ADB and GIZ. \n \n24.  The BTRC has agreed to collaborate with the TA. Its TMD will provide access to the \nBeijing transport model and traffic data. ADB and GIZ will promote close collaboration and \ninformation sharing between the two TA projects to maximize synergies and avoid duplication. \n \n25.  The  TA  will  require  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n14.5 person-months  of  national  consulting  services  to  carry  out  the  terms  of  reference \n(Appendix 3). Individuals and firms will need to be recruited. Individual consultants are needed \nbecause the TA is an advanced assignment that requires highly specialized expertise in TDM, \ntransport pricing policy, transport emission analysis, transport and traffic analysis modeling, and \nnetwork analysis. The firm will be recruited on the basis of the quality of the proposal (90%) and \ncost of services to be provided (10%) using simplified technical proposal procedures. The 90:10 \nweighting is appropriate because of the high level of expertise required by the TA. \n \n26.  Coordination of different consultants with different expertise will be important for the \nsuccess of the TA project. The project leader will be an experienced urban transport specialist \nwith extensive experience in urban transport, environment, and TDM. The project leader will be \nresponsible for coordinating the consulting activities and consolidating the outputs produced by \ndifferent parts of the consulting team. \n \n27.  BASS will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access, \nmaterials, data, and documents required by the TA project. BASS will also cover the cost of \nutilities for the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff. TA equipment will \nbe procured by the consultants and transferred to BASS upon completion of the TA. The TMD \nof the BTRC will provide the consulting team with access to the Beijing transport model updated \nin 2011 and traffic data compiled since 2007. An emissions module for the model will be \nprocured and calibrated by the consultants, and transferred to TMD upon completion of the TA. \n \n28.  The consultants will be required to submit an inception report, interim report, draft final \nreport, and other progress reports stated in Appendix 3. These reports and the performance of \nconsultants will be monitored and evaluated by BASS and ADB. Three workshops with a range \nof stakeholders, partners, and external experts will be held to review and disseminate the TA \nfindings. The final report will be published on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Beijing Sustainable Urban Transport, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nAn energy efficient,  By 2018, modal share of  BMG reports and statistics  BMG agrees in implementing \nenvironment friendly and  public transport increases    recommended policy and \nintelligent urban transport  from  30% in 2011 to 45%    strategies by the TA. \nsystem developed in     \nBeijing   By 2018, average annual  Risk \ndriving distance per vehicle  Acceptability of policy and \nis reduced from 16,000 in  strategies recommended by \n2011 to 12,000  the TA \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nRecommendations for  Policy and strategy  Resolution of working group  BMG remains committed to \nsustainable urban  recommendations submitted    policy and strategy \ntransport policy and traffic  to BMG by 2013  BMG reports  implementation to enhance the \nmanagement strategies    sustainability of Beijing urban \nfor Beijing are submitted    transport. \nto BMG.   \nTA results are politically and \nsocially acceptable by BMG. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

General \n1.  The proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) requires a wide range of \nexpertise in travel demand management (TDM) and nonmotorized transport (NMT) strategies, \nurban transport infrastructure development, traffic operation, and transport and traffic modeling \n(including  emissions  modeling  and  health  impact  modeling).  A  good  understanding  of  the \nexisting urban transport and policies and measures implemented in Beijing also is needed. The \nTA requires close coordination among these experts, with the executing agency and other key \nagencies involved, and between the different phases of the TA. \n2.
