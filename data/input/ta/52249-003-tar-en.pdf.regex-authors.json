INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will design a climate-friendly, \nenergy-efficient cooling initiative in Ningbo to simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions  and  improve  energy  efficiency  in  multiple  sectors  related  to  refrigeration  and/or \ncooling.1 \n \n2.  The TA is fully aligned with the priority of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), 2016\u20132020 on managing climate \nchange and the environment to support the government\u2019s priorities in realizing an \u201cecological \ncivilization\u201d.2 The TA supports the strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to mitigate climate \nchange and promote environmental sustainability.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In the past 30 years, the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has resulted in the \neffective control of ozone layer depletion and the use of ozone-depleting substances. As a \nsubstitute for ozone-depleting substances, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are being widely used as \nrefrigerants for refrigeration and/or air conditioning systems. Although HFCs are believed to have \na negligible impact on the ozone layer, they have global warming potential (GWP) several \nthousand times than that of carbon dioxide (CO ) and, with an annual growth rate of 10%, are the \n2\nfastest growing GHGs. \n \n4.  Because of the destructive effect of HFCs on the global climate, a legally binding deal was \nreached to phase out HFCs in the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol during the 28th Meeting \nof the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in 2016.4 The PRC is the world\u2019s largest user of HFCs, and \nthe urgency of taking actions in addressing HFCs-induced climate change is prominent. In \naddition, operation of refrigeration and/or air conditioning systems also consumes enormous \namounts of fossil fuel-powered electricity, and the large amount of fossil fuel consumption is also \nthe main source of GHG emissions and air pollution. European research data shows that CO  \n2\nemissions caused by cooling energy consumption have contributed nearly 10% of global CO  \n2\nemissions.5 \n \n5.  Although the PRC has made many efforts to improve energy efficiency in the industrial, \ncommercial, and residential sectors, the potential for energy savings and GHGs reductions in the \nrefrigeration and/or cooling sector is far from being tapped. According to the research supported \nby the Energy Foundation, increasing energy efficiency by 30% in residential and commercial air \nconditioners in the PRC by 2020 would result in energy savings equivalent to saving the power \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 December 2018. \n2  An \u201cecological civilization\u201d refers to achieving harmony between growth, people, and nature. It includes activities to \nmitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between the \nenvironment and the economy. ADB. 2016.

However, the lack of advanced technical solutions and effective financing mechanisms \nhas made investors prioritize less-efficient solutions in the refrigeration and/or cooling systems in \nthe PRC. The traditional way of doing small and isolated energy-saving projects makes it difficult \nto attract investment. Implementing a large-scale initiative could create opportunities for energy \nefficiency improvement in all sectors related to cooling from cold storage and/or refrigeration \nwarehouses, food services, supermarkets, industrial production, and supply chain transportation \nto air conditioning in commercial, public, and residential buildings. As one of the most important \nenergy production and manufacturing bases in the PRC, Ningbo\u2014the country\u2019s largest port and \na dynamic city of 7.6 million people\u2014presents a unique opportunity to showcase advanced \nsolutions and innovative financing mechanisms for climate-friendly refrigeration and/or cooling to \ndemonstrate best practices for other cities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: mitigated climate change and improved air \nquality and public health in Ningbo.8 The TA will have the following outcome: a climate-friendly \nand energy-efficient cooling initiative in Ningbo adopted.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Current national policies on energy efficiency improvement and reduction \nof GHG emissions in the cooling sector assessed. The TA will assess (i) the adequacy of \ncurrent national policies on energy efficiency improvement and reduction of GHG emissions in \nthe cooling sector, and (ii) how these policies are implemented at the local level. The current \nenergy efficiency and GHG emission standards for cooling equipment in the PRC will also be \nanalyzed. \n \n9.  Output 2: Advanced refrigeration and/or cooling technologies and applications \nidentified. A significant hurdle for greater cooling efficiency and cooling-related GHG emission \nreduction is the lack of application and access to advanced technologies. The TA will identify and \nassess a wide range of advanced technologies and relevant technical solutions in the PRC and \nother countries, including high-efficiency cooling systems, low to zero GHG emission refrigerants, \nnatural refrigerants such as CO , intelligent control and management technology for refrigeration \n2\nand/or air-conditioning operations, comprehensive utilization of industrial waste heat for cooling, \n                                                \n6 China National Institute of Standardization. 2018.

Output 3: Viable business models and innovative financing mechanisms for the \ncooling initiative in Ningbo developed. The current energy performance contracting (EPC) \nmodel implemented in the PRC cannot play a major role in delivering energy savings and emission \nreductions in scale. Internationally, especially in the United States, a new model\u2014SuperEPC\u2014\nhas become an important approach to energy savings.10 The TA will assess the feasibility of \nemploying the SuperEPC model for carrying out the city-scale initiative. The TA will also assess \nother innovative business models, including cooling as a service model,11 contracting for a full-\nblown operation model,12 and contracted maintenance services.13 The TA will also identify key \nbarriers as well as solutions regarding financing large-scale cooling efficiency deployment by \nassessing  the  feasibility  and  implementation  strategies  of  different  financing  mechanisms, \nincluding (i) leveraging private investment for future public\u2013private partnership in financing; (ii) \nresults-based financing to explore the feasibility of adopting variable rates and terms based on \nthe projects\u2019 performance of energy savings and emission reductions; (iii) the Green Cooling \nInvestment Fund that can be jointly established by governments, banks, fund management \ncompanies, energy service companies, other private investors, and other entities participating in \nthe initiative; and (iv) asset-based securitization:14 after the projects in the initiative establish a \nstable cash flow, the receivables generated by the private investment can be securitized. \n \n11.  Output 4: An internet+ cooling prototype for optimal resource utilization designed. \nThe internet+ concept and the sharing economy provide several benefits such as optimizing the \nutilization  of  resources,  avoiding  waste,  and  reducing  costs.  For  example,  under-utilized \nrefrigerated space in cold storage and supply chain transportation equipment can be shared by \nother facilities to optimize resources, save energy, and reduce emissions. The TA will apply the \nconcept of internet+ and a sharing economy in the cooling sector and assess the feasibility of \ncreating two types of an internet-enabled platform: (i) an application that enables the effective \nsharing of underutilized refrigeration and/or cooling resources, and (ii) an online equipment-\ntracking platform that gathers and analyzes real-time energy usage data from sensors installed in \nall retrofitted refrigeration and/or cooling equipment for identifying potential problems and spotting \nimprovement opportunities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n10 This model makes full use of emerging opportunities in different market segments and packages, several projects to \nform a single unified contract that encompasses multiple sectors, multiple energy sources, and diverse technologies. \n11 In this model, refrigeration and/or cooling equipment manufacturers will become service providers, while the industrial \nand/or commercial facilities purchase the refrigeration and/or cooling services from the service providers. \n12 This model enables customers to own their refrigeration and/or cooling systems and outsource the operations to a \nprofessional service provider to ensure an optimal operation to achieve energy efficiency and emission reduction \ntargets and lower operating costs. \n13 Under this model, a customer owns and operates its own refrigeration systems but enters into a long-term tuning \nservice contract with a professional service provider who will conduct performance and system checks regularly to \nkeep equipment operating at optimum conditions. \n14 Asset-based securitization converts non-tradable financial assets into tradable capital market securities, increases \ninvestment liquidity; revitalizes investors\u2019 financial assets; and attracts diversified investors, including institutional \ninvestors. \n ", "4 \n13.
