INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will operate for 18 months and will \ndevelop a plan to revitalize and build resilience in the Ravi River Basin in the province of Punjab, \nPakistan. The river basin is being heavily polluted with urban, industrial, and agricultural waste, \ncreating major human health, food, and water safety risks. These risks will continue to worsen \nwithout urgent action by the government and society. The TA will support activities to assess the \npollution problem, identify and close institutional gaps, raise awareness, and develop a long-term \nplan to revitalize and build resilience in the basin, with detailed investment recommendations. \n \n2.  This TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Pakistan.1 It is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan,  which  includes  support  for  wastewater  treatment,  river  basin \nmanagement,  and  pollution  control.2 The  TA  was  requested  by  the  Punjab  Environment \nProtection Department (EPD) through the Punjab Planning and Development Board and the \nEconomic Affairs Division of the federal government in July 2017, and confirmed through an aide-\nm\u00e9moire in November 2017. Support for the TA is included in the ADB Water Sector and \nEnvironment Thematic Group work plans. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Ravi River is one of the six transboundary rivers of the Indus River system. It flows \nfrom the Himalaya in northwestern India through eastern Pakistan. The river merges into the \nChenab River and then the Indus, which flows to the Arabian Sea. About 50 million people live in \nthe basin within Pakistan.3 This includes 24 million urban dwellers in Punjab\u2019s major cities of \nLahore (population 11 million) and Faisalabad (4 million), and in about 70 other urban areas. The \nbasin experiences huge flow variations, ranging from 10 cubic meters per second in the dry \nseason to 10,000 cubic meters per second in the wet season. \n \n4.  The river provides critical ecosystem services that support Punjab\u2019s economy. The river \nforms part of the Indus Basin Irrigation System within Punjab, the world\u2019s largest contiguous \nirrigation system, and irrigates 2.9 million hectares of agricultural lands that account for about \n30% of Pakistan\u2019s agricultural cultivation. The river\u2019s previously rich biodiversity hosted at least \n31 fish species, among other wildlife, that offered livelihoods for Punjab\u2019s rural poor.4 Its partial \nflow through the Lahore Canal also has recreational and cultural value to residents of Lahore. \n \n5.  Heavy pollution. Despite its economic value, the river basin has become heavily polluted \nsince the 1990s. Punjab\u2019s cities, industries, and agricultural areas have developed without \neffective infrastructure to control, capture, and treat their discharges of polluted water, and without \neffective policies and regulations in place to reduce the pollution at source. This problem is not \nunique to the Ravi basin but is made worse there because of its large population and many farms, \ncities, and industries. Pakistan treats only about 1% of its urban wastewater.5 The country \npartnership strategy notes that Pakistan\u2019s environmental management is weak and ineffectual, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 November 2017.

Islamabad. \n ", "2 \nwith root causes including policy and regulatory gaps, insufficient monitoring and enforcement, \ntechnical and capacity constraints, low public awareness, and low levels of investment. \n \n6.  Pollution of the river basin and its health risks are not well documented. The river is \nbiologically dead (i.e., lacking dissolved oxygen) along much of its reach downstream of Lahore, \naccording to a 2009 report by the Punjab EPD.6 The report noted major pollution sources as \nhousehold wastewater, industrial effluent, agricultural runoff, and solid waste.7 A 2014 report by \nthe World Wide Fund for Nature Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) assessed the situation of the river near \nLahore, mapping major urban drains and industrial discharges, and concluded that the Ravi is \nPunjab\u2019s most polluted river.8 \n \n7.  Major risks. Notwithstanding lack of data, experts agree that pollution has been creating \nmajor health, environmental, food, and water safety risks that hurt Punjab\u2019s economy and worsen \nits poverty. Poor sanitation and wastewater management in Pakistan cost 3.9% of gross domestic \nproduct in 2006, of which about 90.0% was health related.9 In 2015, more than 50% of all reported \ndiseases in Punjab were waterborne.10 Pakistan has insufficient water resources, and poor water \nquality makes this worse. Farmers, for instance, are forced to use polluted water to irrigate their \ncrops, which creates scarcity of safe food as heavy metals and harmful chemicals can accumulate \nin crops irrigated with polluted water. Fish and other wildlife cannot live in a dead river, depriving \nrural poor people of a critical food source and livelihood. The river\u2019s recreational and cultural value \nhas also declined, with media reports characterizing it as a \u201cdumping pit\u201d and \u201csludge carrier.\u201d11 \nPollution has a direct economic impact on local water suppliers as well. The Water and Sanitation \nAgency in Lahore, for example, reportedly needs to draw groundwater from depths of about 200 \nmeters\u2014with major pumping costs\u2014to avoid pollutant contamination at shallower depths. \n \n8.  Pakistan is among the world\u2019s most climate-vulnerable countries, and climate change may \nalter the river\u2019s flow and increase floods and droughts that worsen pollution risks. Regional climate \nchange models project that, by mid-century, the river\u2019s seasonal flow variations may increase \nbecause of rainfall variability, glacial melt, and rising water demand from higher temperatures.12 \nClimate change could raise the risk of extreme floods or droughts, which pose major economic \nthreats to the basin\u2019s 50 million people. Droughts and reduced flows can concentrate pollutants \nin the river, while floods can create pollution spikes by washing polluted soil and solid waste into \nthe river. \n \n9.  Required actions. Risks will worsen without urgent action by the government and society. \nThe government needs to strengthen its policies, institutions, and regulations to improve water \nquality management in the basin. Punjab\u2019s cities, industries, and agricultural areas need to invest \nin pollution control infrastructure and services. Policies and investments also need to be resilient \nto reduced river flows and increased flow variability that may be caused by climate change. \n \n                                                \n6  Government of Punjab, EPD. 2009.

Punjab has requested ADB support to ensure that its actions avoid repeating past failures. \nPollution in the Ravi River has been a known problem since at least 1995, though past clean-up \nefforts rarely moved beyond the concept stage.13 Two national water sector strategies from 2002 \nand 2012 highlighted the need to clean up the river and included investment proposals, but these \nhave not materialized.14 A government-endorsed wastewater treatment feasibility study prepared \nwith financial support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2009 recommended a \n$413 million investment, while a similar study by a French consultant in 2011 recommended a \n$118 million investment. Neither project went ahead (footnote 13). In 2012, the Lahore High Court \nordered  the  establishment  of  the  Ravi  River  Commission  to  help  clean  up  the  river.  The \ncommission reviewed the situation and prepared a report recommending a low-cost ($500,000) \nbioremediation plant in Lahore as a first step (footnote 13). Soon after, however, the Lahore \nDevelopment Authority proposed a $3 billion waterfront urban development project for the river \nthat could preclude the treatment plant and pose further environmental risks. These organizations \nhave been debating the issue in court and progress has stalled. \n \n11.  Technical  and  institutional  constraints  prevented  the  success  of  these  efforts.  The \ngovernment has struggled to prioritize  pollution risks to date because of lack of data and \nawareness on the risks and impacts of pollution, and cost-effective ways to reduce pollution. \nSolving the problem also needs a coordinated, multistakeholder response to reduce pollution at \ndifferent sources, including local governments, industries, and urban service providers in basin \ncities and towns. The Ravi lacks a river basin management agency or its equivalent that could \ncoordinate its many stakeholders and decide on issues such as the conflicting bioremediation and \nwaterfront development projects mentioned in para. 10. \n \n12.  With growing public awareness of the pollution crisis, the government of Punjab has \nappointed new environmental managers in the EPD and committed to take actions for the river \nbasin with ADB assistance. The EPD has already budgeted for a contribution of up to PRs200 \nmillion to support this effort. The TA aims to contribute to addressing the pollution crisis by \nimproving monitoring and enforcement capacity, filling regulatory and institutional gaps, raising \nawareness on pollution risks and cost-efficient ways to reduce pollution, and increasing levels of \ninvestment and public priority toward this crisis. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: water quality in the Ravi River Basin in \nPakistan improved.15 The TA will have the following outcome: environmental water management \nin the Ravi River Basin improved.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Comprehensive situation assessment of the river basin completed. Output \n1 will assess the pollution situation in the basin and its health impacts, its climate change risks \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2015.

This will include \nreviewing existing data sets, reports, lessons learned, and best practices to ensure that each of \nthese four assessments is broader and deeper than previous efforts. Output 1 will summarize the \nresults of these assessments in an ADB knowledge product aimed at public and government \naudiences in Pakistan and other ADB member countries. The output will raise public awareness \nto make the scale of the pollution problem clear and create support needed to achieve output 2. \n \n15.  Output 2: Environmental water management plan for the river basin completed. \nOutput 2 will develop a long-term, multisector plan to revitalize and build resilience in the basin, \nincluding recommendations for investment projects and institutional reforms. The output will \nfacilitate multistakeholder visioning exercises that will develop an analytical framework for the \nplan. Through a structured process that the TA will develop, the TA will select key government \nofficials who will receive local training from international experts and go on international study \ntrips to learn the best practices for river basin management and river revitalization in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and elsewhere. Output 2 will draft the plan, which will be digitally disseminated \nto local stakeholders, and identify priority infrastructure or institutional reform projects for follow-\non  ADB  investment.17 The  plan  will  identify  and  prioritize  projects  through  a  structured \nconsultation process and ranking method that the TA will develop and validate with its steering \ncommittee. Output 2 will prepare one or two prefeasibility studies, or update existing ones, and \nprovide  inputs  to  ADB\u2019s  project  processing  documents  to  seek  clearance  for  the  project \nconcept(s). \n \n16.  Methods  and  activities.  For  both  outputs,  the  TA  will  take  a  reflective  and \nmultistakeholder approach to learn from past failures and coordinate with key departments, major \npolluters, civil society, and development partners. This approach is a lesson learned from this \ncontext,  where  previously  unsuccessful  efforts  were  attempted  without  broad  consultation \nbetween various departments and other stakeholders. The TA team will review and consult on \nexisting data sets, reports, feasibility studies, and plans, and will structure the TA in a way that \nwill update and add value to these inputs. \n \n17.  The TA will coordinate, through an internal working group, with three ADB activities.18 The \nfirst  activity  will  transform the  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  into  a  holistic  water  resources \ndepartment. The TA will align its work with this transformation and will ensure that the department \nis consulted regularly during the process. The second activity aims to promote investments in \nnatural capital and ecosystem services, and may work in the Ravi River Basin. The TA may \ninclude the natural capital assessments and investments it develops  into output 1\u2019s public \nknowledge product and output 2\u2019s proposed projects. The third activity is a new ADB investment \nproject for wastewater treatment in Sahiwal city, which lies in the Ravi basin. The TA will \ncoordinate with this project, which will offer lessons on designing sustainable operation and \nmaintenance arrangements for wastewater treatment in the river basin. \n \n                                                \n17 Future investments may include urban planning and wastewater treatment, industrial and agricultural effluent control, \nsolid-waste management, surface water and groundwater storage and control infrastructure, and waterborne disease \ncontrol. Institutional reforms may include setting up a river basin management agency, strengthening the EPD, or \ndeveloping more flow transfers to the Ravi River using Punjab\u2019s system of link canals. \n18 ADB. 2016.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,210,000, of which (i) $460,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), (ii) $550,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund \n(PRCF) and administered by ADB, and (iii) $200,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nMulti-Donor  Trust  Fund 19  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (WFPF)  and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n19.  The PRCF finances TA operational expenses in all ADB developing member countries, \nincluding institution and capacity building, demonstrative programs, knowledge sharing, and \nnetworking. Eligible expenses include TA consulting services; ineligible expenses include staff \nconsultants, activities involving civil works, and large-scale equipment procurement. The PRCF \nwill finance different ratios of each output as described in Appendix 2. \n \n20.  The WFPF finances TA operational expenses in all ADB developing member countries, \nincluding project preparation, knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and institution and capacity \nbuilding. Eligible expenses include consulting services, equipment, and works. The WFPF will \nfinance different ratios of each output as described in Appendix 2. \n \n21.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace and utilities, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, meeting venues, pollution \nsampling equipment and laboratory analysis costs, data and documents, coordination among \ngovernment departments, and other in-kind contributions. The EPD has additionally budgeted up \nto PRs200 million in funds to support the TA outputs, which it will administer separately from \nADB\u2019s fund flow and will not involve jointly financed contracts with ADB. The EPD may use these \nfunds to support its counterpart contributions and to develop a pollution control project using \nnature-based treatment methods that align with the TA outputs. The TA will provide advice to the \nEPD on how best to use these funds. The EPD will confirm the allocation and use of these funds \nduring TA implementation, in consultation with ADB and the TA consultants and partners. The \nEPD\u2019s eventual use of these funds will be considered when ADB assesses the government\u2019s \ncommitment to ensuing loan projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB will administer the TA and will select consultants. ADB and the government of Punjab \nwill coordinate the TA activities and will oversee the timely delivery of the deliverables of each \npartner and consultant. The indicative implementation period will be March 2018\u2013September \n2019, which is sufficient to mitigate risks of delay. The Punjab Planning and Development Board \nwill chair a TA steering committee of government departments. The EPD, through its Strategic \nPlanning and Implementation Unit, will be the executing agency and provide day-to-day support \nto the activities and coordination of the steering committee and its technical working group(s). The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n23.  The TA steering committee will convene to make key decisions on TA progress and \ndeliverables, and may comprise senior staff from the following Punjab government agencies and \npartners (subject to confirmation and after TA approval): EPD; Irrigation Department; Agriculture \nDepartment;  Local  Government  and  Community  Development  Department;  Primary  and \nSecondary  Health  Care  Department;  Housing,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Health \n                                                \n19 Financing partners are the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "6 \nEngineering  Department;  Industries,  Commerce,  and  Investment  Department;  and  WWF-\nPakistan. \n \n24.  The TA will convene technical working group(s) to support the consultants and partners \nwith their day-to-day activities, and these groups may comprise mid-level staff from the steering \ncommittee member agencies, as well as from agencies such as the Punjab Food Department; \nPunjab Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries Department; local chambers of commerce; prominent local \nacademics;  Indus  Waters  Commission;  urban  water  and  sanitation  agencies;  urban  waste \nmanagement companies; urban development authorities; and the Urban Unit.20 The TA may also \nengage national agencies where relevant, including the Ministry of Water Resources, the Pakistan \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the Planning Commission. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  March 2018\u2013September 2019 \nimplementation \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Punjab EPD \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nInternational firm: quality-based  Consultancy services for  $1,055,000 \nselection, full technical proposal,  river basin assessment and \nperformance-based  management planning \nprocurement \nAdvance contracting  Procurement of the international consulting firm is undergoing advance \ncontracting by ADB. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
