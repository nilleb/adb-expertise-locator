Capacity  building  is  essential  to  integrate  developing  countries  into  the  multilateral \ntrading  system  as  called  for  by  the  Statement  of  G-7,  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \n(APEC) leaders\u2019 meetings and World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial conferences. As \ninternational  trade  plays  a  key  role  in  reducing  poverty  by  increasing  economic  growth, \ninternational institutions are invited to assist in this area. In 2001, WTO launched a new round \n(Doha Round) to revitalize the world economy by expanding trade.  \n2.  In January 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strengthened its services in the \ntrade sector by creating governance, finance, and trade divisions in each regional department. \nIn  addition,  in  May  2002,  ADB  and  WTO  concluded  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to \ncooperate in technical assistance (TA) activities involving WTO-related issues in the region. \nADB launched two WTO-related capacity-building programs in 20021 and 2003.2 They covered \ntwo high-level meetings for developing member country (DMC) negotiators on the WTO trading \nsystem and on key Doha Round issues; and six courses on trade facilitation, WTO customs \nvaluation  agreement,  WTO  trade-related  aspects  of  intellectual  property  rights  agreement, \nantidumping, rules of origin, and investment. Responses to an evaluation questionnaire indicate \nthat these activities are timely and relevant to the DMCs, and that they appreciate ADB\u2019s \ncapacity-building efforts on WTO-related areas. \n3.  Since the launch of the Doha Round in November 2001, negotiations have started in \nsuch areas as agriculture and trade in services, and new areas such as trade facilitation. Among \nthe DMCs, 22 are WTO members and 10 are WTO applicants. WTO members agreed to the \nframework or modalities for the Doha Round at the WTO General Council in July 2004, and set \nthe new concluding date for negotiations for 1 January 2006. All applicants to WTO may \nparticipate in the Doha Round. The Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference is set for Hong Kong, \nChina in December 2005, thus 2005 will be crucial for successfully completing the Doha Round.  \n4.  The proposed capacity-building program supported by the TA is directly linked to ADB\u2019s \noverarching objective of poverty reduction. It will strengthen the framework for liberalizing and \nfacilitating international trade under the WTO trading regime to hasten economic growth as \nincome level increases. It will also enhance the DMCs\u2019 capacity to formulate national trade \npolicies. Appendix 1 gives the TA framework. 3  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Since 2005 will be crucial for concluding the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), TA \nwould be timely and useful to provide the 32 DMC negotiators with technical and intellectual \ninputs and policy options on key Doha Round negotiating areas, such as agriculture, market \naccess, rule-making areas, and trade facilitation. While the two previous regional TAs covered \nseveral important WTO issues and agreements, two other key areas need to be addressed.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Developing Member Countries on the World Trade \nOrganization Trading System. Manila. The regional technical assistance (TA 6035) was approved on 4 June 2002. \n2  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building on Selected World Trade Organization Issues. Manila.   \nThe regional technical assistance (TA 6142) was approved on 28 November 2003.   \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 November 2004. \n   \n \n ", "2 \n6.  First is the accession issue.4 Of the 25 WTO applicants,5 10 (40%) are ADB DMCs. \nSince the launch of the Doha Round, only Cambodia and Nepal have been admitted to WTO. \nDMC  applicants  include  economies  in  transition  in  the  Central  Asian  republics  and  island \ncountries in the Pacific. Given the number of benefits of WTO membership, these 10 applicants \nshould be provided with technical knowledge to support admission as soon as possible. \n7.  The second area is WTO\u2019s dispute settlement mechanisms (DSMs), a right to due \nprocess enjoyed by all WTO members on equal footing. WTO prohibits its members from \ninvoking  unilateral  trade  sanctions  against  any  member.  Any  trade  dispute  between  WTO \nmembers must be settled under the DSMs agreed at the Uruguay Round. Recently, complaints \nhave been increasingly filed against the DMCs by other WTO members. This trend is likely to \ngrow. However, the DMCs\u2019 knowledge about the DSMs\u2014such as panel proceedings and strict \ntime limit at each stage of the panel\u2014remains insufficient.  \n8.  While the Doha Round started on 1 November 2001, its framework or modality for \nnegotiations was agreed on only in July 2004. The Doha Round aims, in particular, to reduce or \neliminate customs tariffs on both agricultural and industrial products, domestic support and \nexport subsidies on agricultural products, and other types of nontariff barriers in order to expand \ninternational trade. It is now timely and important to evaluate developments in the Doha Round, \ngive intellectual and technical inputs on key Doha Round issues, and provide the DMCs with \npolicy options for successful conclusion of the Doha Round.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  goal  of  this  TA  is  to  promote  the  full  integration  of  the  DMCs  into  the  WTO \nmultilateral trading system. To achieve this goal, the TA aims to increase awareness and \nexpertise of senior officials responsible for WTO and Doha round issues through delivering \nthree specific outputs: (i) successful conclusion of High-level meeting for director-general level \nand above negotiators; (ii) successful completion of training course on accession for senior \nofficials; and (iii) successful completion of intensive training course on dispute settlement.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA\u2019s capacity-building program has three key components: (i) a high-level meeting \nfor DMC negotiators on WTO key Doha Round issues, (ii) an intensive course on accession, \nand (iii) an intensive course on dispute settlement mechanisms (Appendix 2). In implementing \nthe three activities, the Economics and Research Department (ERD) of ADB will consult with \nAPEC, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, World Customs Organization, \nWTO, and other relevant organizations. Target participants will be actual DMC negotiators (e.g., \ndirectors-general and officials of higher ranks in charge of the DDA) for the high-level meeting \n                                                 \n4  The accession process starts with the application for WTO membership by a non-WTO member. Then, the WTO\u2019s \nGeneral Council decides on whether to establish a working party that would (i) examine the trade regime of an \napplicant as to whether the regime is consistent with the WTO General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, based on \nthe Memorandum on Foreign Trade Regime prepared by the applicant; and (ii) draft a working party report for the \nGeneral Council. Bilateral trade negotiations on trade in goods and services take place after the examination of the \ntrade regime. Finally, the General Council decides on the final package (working party report, protocol, and lists of \ncommitments). \n5  As of October 2004. \n   ", "  3\nand senior government officials (e.g., directors and officials of higher ranks in charge of one of \nthe two areas covered) for the two intensive courses. \n11.  High-Level Meeting on WTO Key Doha Round Issues, July/August 2005, Osaka. As \nthe DDA will be in a crucial stage of negotiations in 2005, the meeting will focus only on \nimportant topics. The three-day meeting for DMC negotiators will aim to (i) review and evaluate \nthe key DDA negotiating areas, (ii) provide technical and theoretical inputs to the DMCs, and (iii) \nexamine policy options for the DMCs on such areas as market access, agriculture, trade in \nservices, and trade facilitation.6 The Osaka Local Government is willing to host this event. \n12.  Intensive  Course  on  Accession,  February/March  2006,  Bangkok.  Ten  DMCs  in \nCentral Asia, Mekong Region, and the Pacific are currently applying for WTO membership: \nAzerbaijan, Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Samoa, Tajikistan, Tonga, \nUzbekistan, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam. While accession issues are examined at a WTO working \nparty  by  applicant,  the  degree  of  such  examination  varies  from  one  applicant  to  another \n(Appendix 3). A five-day course on accession will (i) review progress at the working party, based \non country presentations of each applicant; (ii) provide country experiences of some WTO \nmembers recently admitted to WTO; and (iii) provide technical inputs and advice by experts. \nThree midlevel officials from the ministries of trade, agriculture, and finance who are directly \ninvolved in the WTO accession negotiations, for the 10 WTO applicant countries, will participate.  \n13.  Intensive Course on Dispute Settlement Mechanisms, Singapore, May  2006.  A \nWTO  agreement  on  the  DSMs,  officially  entitled  Understanding  on  Rules  and  Procedures \nGoverning the Settlement of Disputes, provides the following mechanisms to settle disputes \nbetween WTO members. The first mechanism is consultations between the parties concerned. \nThe second is the creation of a panel to examine a particular case. If one of the parties is not \nsatisfied with the findings of the panel, it is referred to the third mechanism, review of the \nStanding Appellate Body of seven members. In addition, the parties concerned may accept \ngood offices, conciliation, and mediation. Strict time limits are set on panel proceedings to settle \ndisputes without delay. \n14.  A five-day course on the DSMs will (i) review the recent trend of dispute cases, (ii) \nexamine DSM principles, (iii) discuss DSM judicial and panel proceedings, (iv) provide case \nstudies, and (v) provide practical information when complaints are filed against the DMCs.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent to finance the travel, hotel \naccommodation, and other related expenses of resource persons and participants. The TA will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe details of the financing plan are shown in Appendix 4.  \n                                                 \n6  Negotiating positions vary from one member to another, reflecting the member\u2019s national interest. For example, \nagriculture is the most important and difficult area for every negotiating member. Negotiations have three pillars, \nnamely reduction/elimination of (i) customs duty on agricultural products (market access), (ii) export subsidies, and \n(iii) domestic support. Net exporters of agricultural products (United States, the Cairns group led by Australia, G20-\nBrazil, India, and other member countries) request radical reforms so that such disciplines over industrial products \nare applicable to agricultural products. On the other hand, net importers (European Union, Japan, Republic of \nKorea, Switzerland, and others) want progressive reforms and the consideration of nontrade concerns. \n   \n \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ERD  will  implement  the  TA  in  cooperation  with  the  Government  of  Japan. \nImplementation is expected to commence in January 2005 and to end in May 2006. To be cost \neffective,  ERD  will  develop  a  curriculum  for  each  of  the  two  intensive  courses,  with  the \nassistance of APEC, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, World Customs \nOrganization, World Intellectual Property Organization, and WTO. While the TA will finance \ntravel  and  per  diem  and,  in  certain  cases,  honorarium  for  resource  persons,7  key  APEC \neconomies are expected to send their experts at their own cost as in-kind contributions to the \nprogram. To avoid duplication of activities,  ADB is invited to all APEC meetings on WTO \ncapacity building to monitor and coordinate relevant projects conducted by APEC, WTO, and \nbilateral agencies. \n17.  DMC participants will come from Azerbaijan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Republic of \nKorea; Kyrgyz Republic; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Maldives; Mongolia; \nMyanmar;  Nepal;  Pakistan;  Papua  New  Guinea;  Philippines;  Samoa;  Singapore;  Solomon \nIslands; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; Tajikistan; Thailand; Tonga; Uzbekistan; Vanuatu; and Viet \nNam. The proceedings for the high-level meeting will be published, and the papers presented in \nthe three courses will be put on an interactive CD-ROM. The activities will be published on \nADB\u2019s web site. The participants will evaluate the activities through a structured questionnaire.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nCapacity Building of Developing Member Countries on Selected World Trade Organization and \nDoha Development Agenda Issues, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7  The resource persons will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Engagement of Resource \nPersons. \n   ", "5 Appendix  1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/  Monitoring   Assumptions and Risks \n  Targets  Mechanisms   \n \nGoal        \nCurrent applicants for WTO  Implementation of all  WTO official   \naccession in the Asia-Pacific  outstanding WTO  documents   \nregion join the World Trade  agreements (e.g. TRIPs     \nOrganization ( WTO) and all  and Customs Valuation     \noutstanding agreements are  agreements)     \nimplemented.       \n  Accession to WTO by \nAzerbaijan, Bhutan, \nKazakhstan, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, \nSamoa, Tajikistan, Tonga, \nUzbekistan, Vanuatu and \nViet Nam. \n \n \nPurpose        \nIncreased awareness and  Future panel cases  WTO official \nexpertise of senior officials  involving Asia-Pacific WTO  documents \nresponsible for WTO and Doha  members are resolved   \nround issues.  within the time limit  ADB follow-up on \n    actions taken \nAction being taken to   \nmake laws consistent with   \nWTO rules   \n \nEach applicant in the Asia-\nPacific region accepts the \nfinal package \nOutputs       Assumption:  DMCs are \nHigh-level meeting for director- 32 officials from 32  Dissemination of  prepared to allow their officials \ngeneral level and above  developing member  information from the  to attend. \nnegotiators successfully  countries (DMCs)  three training   \nconcluded    activities through the   \n  Proceedings published  ADB web site   \n  and CD-ROM produced,    Risks: While DDA involves 148 \n  uploaded in www.adb.org.  members and 25 applicants, \n    negotiations take place as \nTraining course on accession for  30 officials from 10 DMCs  scheduled and they show a \nsenior officials successfully  (Ministry of Trade,  clear political commitment to \ncompleted  Ministry of Finance and  accept a final package. \n  Ministry of Agriculture) \n   \n  Materials uploaded at \n  www.adb.org. \n   \nIntensive training course on  32 participants from 32 \ndispute settlement successfully  DMCs, with the rank of \ncompleted  directors and above \n  Materials uploaded in \n  www.adb.org. \n \n \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  6\n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/  Monitoring   Assumptions and Risks \n  Targets  Mechanisms   \n \nActivities       Assumption:  Resource \nOrganize the following:    N/A  persons from WTO, World \nHigh-Level Meeting on WTO  Scheduled for Osaka in  Customs Organization, United \nKey Doha Round Issues  July/August 2005  Nations Conference on Trade \n    and Development, and  Asia-\nIntensive Course on Accession  Scheduled for Bangkok in  Pacific Economic Cooperation  \nIntensive Course on WTO   February/March 2006  economies are available at the \n    targeted time for the  three \nDispute Settlement Mechanisms  Scheduled for Singapore  activities \nin May 2006.   \nInputs        \nNegotiators to the Doha Round \nfrom DMCs that are WTO \nmembers and applicants to \nWTO; July-August 2005 \n($200,000) \n \nSenior officials from ministries \nof finance, trade, and agriculture \ninvolved with WTO accession; \nFebruary-March 2006 \n($100,000) \n \nSenior trade officials directly \ninvolved with dispute settlement \nmechanisms; May 2006 \n($100,000)  \n \n \n \n \n \n    J.
