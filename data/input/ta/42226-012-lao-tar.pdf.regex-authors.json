INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA)1  to support the Lao PDR \nState Audit Organization (SAO) in order to improve the country\u2019s public sector governance.2 \nSupport for SAO would complement previous ADB support that contributed to professional \ndevelopment of SAO auditors.3 The TA is in line with the ADB country strategy and program \n(CSP), 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDR,4 which underlines good governance through policy and \ninstitutional development as the key to achieving sustainable economic growth. ADB fielded a \nfact-finding mission to Vientiane on 1\u20133 June 2011. The mission and representatives from the \nSAO  held  discussions  and  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Public financial management and accountability. A sound system of public financial \nmanagement (PFM) and accountability are key factors for good governance and for achieving \ndevelopment objectives. Effective supreme audit institutions (SAIs) are an important element of \nsuch systems. Other elements include budgeting, accounting and internal controls, financial \nreporting,  legislative  oversight  and  with  sufficient  independence  (in  funding,  setting  audit \nprograms, carrying out its work, and making findings public) and adequate capacity is important \nto  the  development  agenda.  An  SAI  is  a  critical  part  of  the  checks  and  balances  in  the \nmanagement of public finances. In addition, the 2007 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment Public \nExpenditure Review (IFAPER)5 underlined the critical role that an independent supreme audit \ninstitution could play in ensuring good governance.  \n \n3.  Public  procurement.  Public  procurement  is  at  the  center  of  the  budget  execution \nprocess.  Public  procurement  accounts  for  a  significant  part  of  public  sector  expenditures. \nProcurement refers to acquisition of goods (including works) and services on behalf of a public \nauthority. The government procurement of goods and services accounts for a substantial part of \nthe public expenditure. Public procurement systems entail the highest level of risk in terms of \nfraud and procurement irregularities and waste of public funds. A public procurement system \nmust ensure economy, efficiency, transparency and effectiveness consistent with the objectives \nof public sector programs and policies. In addition, the public sector procurement procedures \nmust provide an assurance against fraud and procurement risks, including conflicts of interest. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in Business Opportunities (proposed projects) on 8 July 2011. \n2  Since 1998, Asian Development Bank (ADB) has had a long standing relationship of support to the Lao PDR in the \narea of Public Expenditure Management. From 1998 to 2007, ADB strategically focused on and consistently \nsupported capacity development in the Ministry of Finance and SAO, providing around $3 million in TA over 7 \nyears, including through: (i) ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for \nEstablishing the National Audit Office. Manila (TA 2987-LAO). (ii) ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Institutional Strengthening of the National Audit Office. Manila (TA 3771-\nLAO).  (iii) ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Enhancing Government \nAccounting Regulations and Procedures Phase II. Manila (TA 4180-LAO). (iv) ADB. 2005.

Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for \nImproved Public Financial Management Systems. Manila (TA 4954-LAO). \n3 ADB.  2007.

Public  sector  procurement  policies  and \nprocedures should uphold the fundamental principles of public sector procurement. This can be \nachieved through the establishment of and meticulous compliance with comprehensive policies \nand procedures. Independent external oversight can provide assurance to stakeholders, and \nparticularly lawmakers responsible for public sector procurement, that policies and procedures \nare being followed. Independent supreme audit institutions, such as the SAO, are expected to \nprovide the most consistent and dependable independent oversight over the public procurement \nsystem, and assurance to stakeholders regarding the integrity and effectiveness of the public \nprocurement system. \n \n5.  State Audit Organization. The government continues to make progress in PFM under \nthe multi-year Public Financial Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP), that includes \nstrengthening SAO.7 External audit is the responsibility of the SAO operating in accordance with \nthe 2007 Audit Law, with the duty to report to the National Assembly. The SAO is rapidly \ngrowing in stature and size\u2014its staff has almost tripled over the past 3 years and two new \nregional  offices  have  been  established.  Matters  included  in  SAO  audit  reports  have  been \ndiscussed and debated in the National Assembly. The Audit Law 2007 enhances the SAO\u2019s \nindependence by having it report to the National Assembly rather than the Prime Minister, as \nwas previously the case. The SAO has begun capacity-building activities for improving financial \naudits with support from selected SAIs and other INTOSAI members. An action plan for 2009\u2013\n2020 has been developed that focuses on building the capacity and defining the resource \nrequirements of the SAO. However, the SAO needs support to build its auditing capacity over \ntime, with the objective of being able to perform its full mandate under the Audit Law 2007 to \ninternational standards within 3\u20135 years, thereby further enhancing public sector transparency \nand accountability in the Lao PDR.  \n  \n6.  The SAO faces major challenges in the development of its workforce, information and \ncommunication systems, and auditing systems and methodologies. The SAO must also respond \nto a number of immediate national priorities, requiring it to build capacity at both a central and a \nregional  level  simultaneously.  The  most  immediate  priority  is  to  position  itself  to  audit,  to \ninternational standards, the government\u2019s revenues from the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydroelectric \nproject,  and  their  allocation  to  poverty  reduction  programs.  The  SAO  needs  to  continue \nincreasing its expertise in the audit of budget execution, including procurement,8 In addition, in \nthe Lao PDR close to 80% public investment project procurement is estimated to be funded by \ndevelopment partners; ensuring the integrity of the procurement process for externally-aided \nprojects is therefore of fundamental importance.  \n \n7.  The  SAO  also  needs  to  strengthen  its  independent  relationship  with  the  National \nAssembly and its reporting practices. Legislative oversight normally takes place through scrutiny \nby the Public Accounts Committee (or similar committees established by the legislature) and a \nlegislative debate. The audit reports of the supreme audit institution of the country is issued to \n                                                \n7  In November 2005, the government approved a five-year Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program, \nwhich constitutes a cohesive framework for addressing weaknesses in PFM; the program has been renamed as \nthe Public Financial Management Strengthening Program .  \n8  ADB. 2009. Governance Risk Assessment. Manila. The 2009 governance risk assessment undertaken by ADB \nidentified (i) frequent collusion among suppliers; (ii) improper sole-source awards; (iii) split purchases to stay below \nthe necessary threshold; (v) rigged specifications; (v) estimates for acquisition that were often close to the bid \nprice; (vi) acceptance of inferior quality work; (vi) higher risks in provinces, as there are few decision makers; (vii) \nrefusal by banks on bid security, because of submission of fraudulent and/or forged documents; (viii) low IT \nquotations due to pirated software; and (ix) higher prices in outer years in multi-year framework contracts due to \nannual commitments. National Assembly members have also expressed concern over problems with bidding, the \nlack of bidders,  lack of transparency, selling of winning bids, and lack of project monitoring. \n ", "  3 \nprovide assurance to the lawmakers that the money voted by them was used for the intended \npurpose, have been brought to accounts and the programs supported by the budget achieve \nthe desired output and outcome. Detailed examination of the audit reports by the designated \nlegislative  committee  lends  finality  to  the  audit  process.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  process  of \nlegislative scrutiny is evolving, and there is a need to ensure that the SAO audit report is viewed \nor scrutinized thoroughly within the scope of the Law on National Assembly, Law on Oversight \nand the Audit Law, and that their recommendations are acted on by the executive branch. This \nwill complete the audit cycle, and strengthen SAO effectiveness. Discussions are currently \nongoing  to  strengthen  the  coordination  mechanism  between  the  SAO  and  the  Economic \nPlanning  and  Finance  Committee  (EPFC).  Meeting  these  needs  will  require  sustained, \ncoordinated support from development partners to (i) develop SAO\u2019s professional tools and \ncapabilities; (ii) position it to deliver on its auditing mandate; (iii) develop its workforce and \nhuman resources management practices; and (iv) develop its reporting practices, consistent \nwith its independent status.9 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be improved accountability in the management of public resources. \nThe outcome of the TA will be improvements in the audit of public sector procurement practice. \nThe  key  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  to  strengthen  SAO  audit  capability  of  public  sector \nprocurement  practices  and  legislative  oversight  of  the  SAO  audit  reports.  These  will  (i) \ncontribute to increased professionalism of SAO through training of SAO auditors in the auditing \nof public procurement transactions, (ii) enable the government to draw the economic benefits of \na sound and well-performing public procurement system, and (iii) enhance legislative scrutiny of \naudit reports and the parliamentary stage of the audit cycle.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Public procurement audit. The objectives of the project are to strengthen the public \nprocurement audit by SAO\u2014both for procurement under externally-aided projects and under \nnational programs in all public sector entities under SAO audit jurisdiction. The TA will seek to \nstrengthen the policy, principles, and procedures for audit of the overall public procurement \nsystem,  with  a  special  focus  on  procurement  under  externally-aided  projects  through \nestablishment of a policy and procedure for consistent and persistent oversight by SAO over \npublic sector procurement systems, procedures, and activities. The key outputs of the TA are: \n \n(i)  Strengthened procurement audit capability. The TA will aim to strengthen \naudit  professionalism  and  improve  skills  in  the  area  of  procurement  audit, \nbuilding  on  earlier  TA  efforts.  A  procurement  guide  was  prepared  under  a \nrecently concluded TA project (footnote 3), and this is an area of considerable \ninterest to the SAO. This TA will specially assist the members of the SAO to \nbetter understand and carry out procurement audits. Specifically, the TA will \nincrease  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  audit  staff  regarding  procurement  best \npractices; help auditors to identify risks relating to procurement processes and \nactivities; assist auditors in achieving a high level of quality and consistency \n                                                \n9  In December 2009 the SAO presented its action plan for 2009\u20132020 to a workshop of development partners and \nother stakeholders. The action plan was the result of a thorough and well-structured process of identifying the \nSAO\u2019s development needs, beginning with an internationally benchmarked peer review (carried out by the New \nZealand SAI) and taking account, at all times, of the wider context of the PFM reforms.  \n ", "4   \nwhen auditing procurement; provide a basis for measuring audit performance; \nand allow others outside the SAO to gain a better perspective and understanding \nof the SAO audit practices. The capacity-building activities will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  INTOSAI  audit  standards,  and  will  include  pre-procurement \nprocedures (examples include preparation of bid requirements, transparency in \nthe bidding process, checks and balances in the bidding process), and post-\nprocurement practices relating to audit and documentation.  \n \n(ii)  Strengthened  legislative  oversight.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  strengthen  the \ninstitutional interface between the National Assembly EPFC and the SAO. The \nTA will seek to support a system of legislative scrutiny of public procurement with \nhelp of the SAO audit reports. The designated legislative committee is mandated \nto examine the audit reports in a systematic manner with the assistance of the \nSAO. To facilitate their detailed review of the audit reports, it is necessary to \ndevelop detailed, step-by-step guidance, rules or manuals that are informed by \ngood  international  practices  and  provide  a  framework  for  the  committee\u2019s \ndetailed  examination.  Issues  covered  in  the  audit  reports  (e.g.,  review  of \naccounts, compliance standards and performance) are technical, and it will be \nnecessary  to  develop  capacity  in  the  designated  committee\u2019s  staff  through \ntraining, workshops, and pilot case studies. The core tasks to facilitate legislative \nscrutiny of the audit reports and strengthen legislative oversight will comprise (i) \ndeveloping  formal  rules  of  procedures  for  detailed  examination  of  the  audit \nreports; (ii) guidance notes and manuals to train stakeholders to strengthen the \nrecommendation  process,  and  the  substance  of  the  recommendations;  (iii) \ncapacity building in the EPFC secretariat and SAO staff; (iv) dissemination of \nprocedures through seminars; and (vi) study tours to build awareness regarding \ngood  practices.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  strengthening  the  coordination \nmechanism between EPFC, SAO and the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  \n \n10.  Assistance will be in the form of inputs, such as (i) support by international and national \nexperts with relevant competencies in core areas of external audit, including mentoring support \nduring  on-the-job  training;  (ii)  seminars,  workshops,  formal  training  (carefully  selected  for \nrelevance, from ADB member countries); (iii) the provision of equipment, including photocopiers, \ndesktop  computers,  laptops,  printers,  and  LCD  projectors  and  other  equipment  for  use  in \ntraining and during pilot audits; and (iv) study tours (subject to resources and on a selected \nbasis).  The  training-of-trainers  approach  will  be  stressed  to  increase  sustainability  and \nknowledge  transfer.  The  TA  will  seek  partnership  with  regional  SAIs  for  capacity  building \ninitiatives  through  seminars,  study  visits,  and  training  on  other  regional  SAIs,  including \nmeasures to outsource audit. and to outsource audits. 11 ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services \nOffice (COSO) will also support practical procurement and consulting recruitment training for \nprocurement audit staff for ADB-financed projects in the Lao PDR under the audit jurisdiction of \nSAO.12   \n \n                                                \n11 The SAO made a request to use senior officials from supreme audit institutions in the region within the scope of the \nSAO\u2019s existing cooperation agreement. According to this proposed arrangement, trainers will be selected who are \n(i) nationals of an ADB member country, and (ii) from selected SAIs with whom SAO has a cooperation agreement. \nThe TA will pay for per diem and hotel accommodations, while the cost of transportation will be met by the external \nsupreme audit institution. This will strengthen peer learning, and would be cost effective. \n12 ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office is responsible for consultant recruitment, executing agency procurement \nreviews, project implementation, portfolio management, and project performance management. \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $825,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nto finance $750,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will finance the balance of the cost, \nequivalent  to  $75,000  through  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  and  utilities, \nadministrative services, physical facilities, and other in-kind contributions. See Appendix 2 for \ndetails of the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The State Audit Organization will be the executing agency, and the implementing agency \nfor activities relating to SAO. In addition, the Department of Economy Planning and Finance of \nthe National Assembly will be the implementing agency for activities falling within the scope of \nits mandate and authority, and having linkages with the work of the SAO. A project management \ncommittee, under the responsibility of director general or deputy director general of the Cabinet \nOffice, will be established in the SAO to monitor activities under the TA. The director-general of \nthe Department of Economy Planning and Finance will undertake project management functions \nfor activities concerning the EPFC.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from November 2011 to October 2013. The \nTA will engage one international consultant for 12 person-months and one national consultant \nfor 24 person-months. The indicative terms of reference of the team of consultants is provided in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be recruited by ADB as individual consultants in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement of goods under the project will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe international principal audit adviser will be the team leader, who will be responsible for \ncompiling and controlling the quality of the all the reports under the TA. All equipment certified \nby the consultants will be turned over to the SAO after the implementation period in accordance \nwith ADB procedures. The monitoring of TA implementation will take place through ongoing \ncommunication  with  the  SAO,  implementing  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders,  as  well  as \nthrough regular missions, consultations and reviews. There will also be close coordination with \ndevelopment partners in implementation of TA activities. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Strengthening  the  Capacity  of  the  State  Audit \nOrganization, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved  Improvement in  PEFA assessment   Political commitment \naccountability in the  aggregate expenditure     \nmanagement of public  out-turn compared to  SAO reports on budget  Sustained support by \nresources   original approved  execution  development partners and \nbudget,  to within 10% of    regional SAIs \nthe budget targets  by  MOF budget execution   \n2015.
