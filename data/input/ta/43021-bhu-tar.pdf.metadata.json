INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bhutan requested technical assistance from the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  in  building  the  capacity  of  the  National  Environment  Commission  (NEC)  for \nmanaging  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation.  ADB  included  the  TA  in  its  country \noperations business plan for Bhutan in 2008.1 An ADB fact-finding mission visited Bhutan from \n24 August to 7 September 2009, and the government agreed with the TA impact, outcome, \noutput, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, and terms of reference. The TA will \nstrengthen NEC's capacity to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation in the spheres \nof energy and water resources management. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan is a least-developed, mountainous, and landlocked country whose population \nand ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change. It is expected that climate change will lead to \nincreasingly  erratic  precipitation  patterns,  including  delayed  arrival  of  seasonal  rainfall  and \nsnowfall, geographical shifts in the distribution of precipitation, flash flooding (exacerbated by \nglacial runoff), and acute droughts in the dry season. Eventually climate change will make \nsignificant impacts on river water flows, which are the backbone of the country's economy and \nlife. Exports of hydropower-generated electricity account for more than 40% of national revenue. \nSeventy  percent  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas  and  depends  heavily  on  irrigated \nagriculture. It is crucial that Bhutan protect its energy and water resources from climate change \nrisks. To do so, it will have to act on two fronts: mitigation and adaptation. \n \n3.  Mitigating  climate  change.  Mitigation  of  climate  change  will  require  policies  and \ndevelopment  actions  that  will  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  While  the  potential  for \nmitigation activities are limited in Bhutan itself because the country is a net sequester of carbon, \nfurther  development  of  hydropower  for  export  could  substantially  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions in the subregion including neighboring countries. Of total power generated in Bhutan, \n70% is exported to India. In July 2009, the Dagachhu hydropower project for power export from \nBhutan was validated for the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations \nFramework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC).  Once  this  project  is  registered  at \nUNFCCC, it will be the first cross-border CDM project where the baseline of the CDM benefits is \ndefined  by  the  Indian  power  supply  system,  which  consists  mainly  of  coal-fired  power \ngeneration. \n \n4.  NEC is the designated national authority for climate change issues and is responsible for \napproving CDM projects in Bhutan. However, it lacks sufficient staff, guidelines, and procedures \nto manage CDM activities. At present, NEC takes environmental protection alone into account \nwhen assessing CDM projects. It pays little attention to the role of sustainable social and \neconomic development in climate change. While CDM opportunities do exist, the country has \nnot tapped adequate resources available for climate change. Currently Bhutan and India are \nplanning more hydropower projects, totaling 10,000 megawatts (MW), in accordance with a \nmutual umbrella agreement. As a result, there will be an urgent need to develop a more \ncomprehensive assessment framework that ensures that water resources will be exploited in a \nsustainable  manner  and  CDM  and  carbon  trading  will  be  promoted.  Setting  low  carbon \nstandards will contribute to the country's sustainable development in the key ADB-supported \nsectors of power and transport, which together account for a large proportion of CO  emissions. \n2\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2009. \n ", "2     \nHigh consumption of firewood in rural areas will also require mitigation through development of \nalternative clean energy sources.2 \n \n5.  Adapting to climate change. Adaptation is considered integral to reducing vulnerability \nto the effects of climate change. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers and glacial lake outburst \nfloods (GLOFs) are serious threats to Bhutan.3 In 2006, NEC prepared the National Adaptation \nProgramme  of  Action  (NAPA),  which  included  45  adaptation  activities  and  nine  priority \nadaptation projects. Water resources management is one of the priority areas of the NAPA. It is \npredicted that global warming will decrease stable water flows from the Himalayas, in turn \nincreasing  the  risk  of  water-related  natural  disasters,  including  GLOFs,  flash  floods,  and \nlandslides. Such disasters could seriously damage not only human settlements but hydropower \nsystems as well. Of more than 3,000 glaciers and glacial lakes, 25 are assessed to be in danger \nof melting. Bhutan has started artificially lowering the water level of one glacial lake to prevent \nflooding, and is installing early warning systems in one river basin,4 but it lacks the finances to \ntake  similar  disaster-prevention  measures  for  its  other  glaciers  and  glacial  lakes.  Proper \nexploitation of water resources is another crucial issue. Planned hydropower projects must be \necologically sustainable and able to adapt to climate change. Climate change will likely increase \nthe sedimentation and soil erosion of rivers and watersheds, affecting irrigation networks, crop \nproductivity, forestry, and water supply. Coupled with temporal and spatial water-flow variations, \nthese changes will severely affect hydroelectricity production and the export revenues for the \ncountry. \n \n6.  Currently no ministry or agency is in charge of overseeing water resources management. \nProvisionally NEC has a mandate to coordinate water issues among relevant ministries and \nagencies. Along with formulating a Water Act, NEC proposes to establish the Bhutan Water \nAuthority to carry out integrated water resources management (IWRM), which will need to \nformulate specific guidelines, business procedures and clear responsibilities for sustainable \nwater usage among the stakeholders. Long-term infrastructure investment in energy and water \nresources in Bhutan should take CDM into account as a way of enhancing project benefits, and \nadapt  adverse  impacts  to  climate  change  in  integrating  energy  and  water  resources \nmanagement, to make sustainable use of such vital resources. \n \n7.  ADB operations and external assistance. ADB has assisted Bhutan in using energy \nresources  efficiently  \u2014  one  of  the  main  emphases  of  climate  change  mitigation.  Energy \nefficiency can further be promoted by use of hydropower, renewable energy, and cleaner fuel \nfor purposes of lighting, cooking, heating, and transport. Particularly, hydropower development \nis the largest driver of pro-poor economic growth in Bhutan. The government aims to develop an \nadditional 10,000 MW for trading power and carbon benefits by 2020. In 2008 ADB provided \nloans5 to assist Dagachhu hydropower export development through a public\u2013private partnership \nand CDM, with attached TA6 to develop institutional capacity to promote more hydropower \nprojects. In 2009, a project preparatory TA was approved to prepare the Rural Renewable \n                                                 \n2  In 2009, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) initiated work to study CDM potential from rural \nelectrification projects of ADB and JICA in Bhutan. \n3  The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that Himalayan glaciers \nare receding faster than in any part of the world and may even disappear by the year 2035. \n4  A GLOF from Thorthormi Lake was predicted to burst as early as 2010. The United Nations Development \nProgramme and Austria are mainly supporting a project to adjust the lake water level and reduce this risk. The lake \nis located in the Punakha\u2013Wangdi valley where the Basochhu hydropower plant and the upcoming Punachangshu \nhydropower plant are installed.  \n5  ADB. 2008.

Building  capacity  in  the  field  of  environment  management,  including  adaptation  to \nclimate change, is one of the key crosscutting themes of ADB's assistance for Bhutan. ADB has \napproved  three  TA  projects  targeting  capacity  development  within  NEC  to  improve \nenvironmental  safeguards  and  compliance  since  the  1990s. 9  The  Danish  International \nDevelopment Assistance (Danida) has also provided NEC with comprehensive assistance for \nenvironment and climate change activities, including preparation for UNFCCC's conferences of \nparties (COP15).10 The World Bank has supported sustainable land management, and the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is conducting a risk assessment of GLOFs in \none river basin.11 In 2006, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) helped NEC \nprepare the NAPA and the National Disaster Risk Management Framework, and UNDP is \ncurrently supporting the preparation of a second national greenhouse gas inventory assessment. \nDespite the importance of water resources in Bhutan, no external assistance has focused on \nIWRM  with  consideration  of  climate  change  adaptation.  Potential  adverse  impacts  on \nhydrological flows for power plants and irrigation will be sensitive to the national energy and \nfood security and inclusive economic growth. These impacts will also increase threats of water \nrelated disasters (including GLOFs). It is critical that NEC prioritize climate change adaptation \nas  an  essential  component  of  environment  management  to  assess  sustainable  natural \nresources usage. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA's impact will be a functioning and sustainable climate change mitigation and \nadaptation system for energy and water resources available in the country and the subregion. \nThis  impact  will  be  realized  through  the  incorporation  of  a  sustainable  climate  change \nframework in planning procedures within ministries and agencies managing energy and water \nresources in Bhutan. The TA 's outcome will be enhanced capacity of NEC to function as a \ndesignated  national  authority  that  will  prioritize  climate  change  risks  in  energy  and  water \nresources development and promote climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. The \nsuccess of the capacity development will be measured by (i) NEC\u2019s ability to properly evaluate \nproject design documents applied for CDM and its relevant framework (e.g., voluntary emission \nreductions);  (ii)  NEC\u2019s  ability  to  effectively  coordinate  the  work  of  ministries  and  agencies \n                                                 \n7 ADB.  2009.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA's outputs will focus on NEC's capacity development for climate change in energy \nand water resources. These include: (i) component 1: Institutional development strategy and \norganizational framework to manage climate change mitigation and adaptation activities; (ii) \ncomponent 2: NEC's own operational toolkits, including guidelines, manuals, and business \nprocedures and responsibilities to take into account environmental assessments and CDM \nappraisal, particularly in the spheres of hydropower (including transmission links), renewable \nenergy, and transport;12 (iii) component 3: NEC\u2019s operational toolkits defined in IWRM taking \nclimate proofing into consideration; (iv) component 4: Climate change modeling and a national \nroad map with a time-bound action plan and financing avenue for climate change activities; and \n(v) component 5: In-house workshops and training programs for managing the toolkits and \nbuilding awareness of sustainable energy and water resources development. \n \n11.  The  climate  change  mitigation  activities  will  primarily  target  hydropower,  renewable \nenergy, and transport emission control.13 The climate change adaptation activities will be based \non IWRM, and will focus on hydropower, watersheds, irrigation, environment management, and \nwater-related disaster risk management.14 \n \n12.  NEC will set up a climate change unit before the end of 2009. NEC will appoint the \ncounterpart team for each component, and the team and consultant will collaborate in producing \nthe  deliverables  through  a  learning-by-doing  approach.  The  training  will  target  the  NEC \nsecretariat and local offices, and selective officials from relevant ministries and agencies. To \nmake the training activities sustainable, NEC will train some NEC officials to be trainers who will \ncontinue to conduct the training programs after the TA has been completed.  \n \n13.  The TA will be coordinated with the work of other civil society groups and donors, \nincluding Danida, JICA, UNDP, and the World Bank, to avoid duplication of activities and \nmaximize the synergy effects of coordination. In consultation with these groups and donors, the \nTA  will  launch  mass  communication  and  awareness  programs  among  the  government's \nministries and agencies to build up the consensus of action plans on a national level.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent.  ADB will provide $700,000 \non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment of Bhutan will finance the remaining $50,000 equivalent of local currency costs \nthrough in-kind contributions, including office accommodation and facilities, counterpart staff, \ndata, and other information. The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                 \n12 It will define the baseline study, data collection, and analysis methodologies in planning, reviewing, evaluating, and \nmonitoring the projects. \n13 The main stakeholders for components 2, 4, and 5 include (i) NEC; (ii) the Department of Energy, Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs; and (iii) the Road Safety and Transport Authority.  \n14 The main stakeholders for components 3, 4, and 5 include (i) NEC; (ii) the Policy and Planning Division and the \nWatershed Management Division, Ministry of Agriculture; and (iii) the Department of Energy, and the Department \nof Geology and Mines, Ministry of Economic Affairs. They will also consult with other relevant ministries, including \nthe Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs for disaster management, the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement \nfor urban water supply, and the Ministry of Health for rural water supply.  \n ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  NEC will be the executing agency and one of implementing agencies (IAs) for the TA \nproject. The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Road Safety and \nTransport Authority will also act as IAs. The NEC's director general will be the project director, \noverseeing  day-to-day  TA  project  implementation.  For  each  of  the  components,  NEC  will \nestablish the counterpart project team and appoint its manager and members from the IAs to \nwork with the consultants and help them liaise with other government ministries and agencies, \nand  obtain  data  and  documentation.  NEC  will  provide  office  space, furniture,  and  support \nfacilities to the TA consultants. \n \n16.  The TA will require 25 person-months of consulting services (19 international and 6 \nnational).  The  consultant  team  will  cover  major  areas  of  expertise:  (i)  climate  change \nmanagement,  (ii)  transport  management,  (iii)  climate  change  economics,  (iv)  environment \nmanagement, (v) water resources management, and (vi) water regulation. The team leader will \nbe an international expert in climate change management. The international consultants will be \nexpected to spend more than 90% of their time in the field. The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. The study is expected to be implemented over 18 months, from April 2010 to \nSeptember 2011. A consulting firm or consortium of firms will be engaged by ADB through its \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and the TA-financed equipment will be \nprocured under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The \ndisbursements will be made under ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.15  \n \n17.  The consultant will submit to NEC, the IAs, and ADB an inception report focusing on the \nwork program no later than 1 month after commencing the consultancy services. Interim reports \nwill be submitted 6 months and 12 months after the start of the services. A draft final report will \nbe  submitted  16  months  after  incorporating  all  of  the  deliverables  and  the  performance \nevaluation achieved under the TA. Tripartite meetings will be held in Bhutan to discuss the \ninception, interim, and draft final reports among the consultant, NEC, the IAs and the ADB \nmission.  Every  6 months,  the  consultant  will  prepare  progress  reports  highlighting  any \nachievements and issues that are critical for the timely completion of the TA. Within 2 months of \nthe tripartite meeting to discuss the draft final report, the consultants will submit a final report in \na format acceptable to ADB after addressing all comments received from the government and \nADB. \n \nIV.
