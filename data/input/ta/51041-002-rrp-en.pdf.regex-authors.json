THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Horticulture Value Chain Infrastructure Project. \n \n2.   The  proposed  project  supports  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  plan  to  establish \nhorticulture clusters where production and post-harvest services can be consolidated to improve \nefficiency and economies of scale. It will finance the establishment of agro-logistic centers (ALCs) \nin two locations\u2014Andijan and Samarkand regions\u2014considering international best practices. The \nALCs will provide all necessary facilities and services in one place: trading, storage, processing, \nfood safety certification, customs clearance, transport, shipping, marketing advisory services, \ntrade finance, and commercial banking. Significantly larger volumes of product with improved \nquality will be marketed as a result of better post-harvest logistics that will facilitate reduced post-\nharvest losses and increased domestic sales and exports. The ALCs will enhance value chain \nlinkages with production, post-harvest processing, and handling following international quality and \nsafety standards. Increased export and domestic marketing of horticultural products will increase \nprice transmission to small-scale producers and small and medium-sized agribusinesses. It will \nalso diversify the country\u2019s agriculture from cotton to horticulture, which generates higher financial \nand economic returns and involves fewer social and environmental concerns.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector performance. Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average \nannual rate of 8% between 2010 and 2016, reaching $63.4 billion. Agricultural GDP grew at a \nslightly lower rate of 7.3% over the same period. This, and higher growth in other sectors, meant \nthat the contribution of agriculture to GDP continued its long-term decline from 34.4% in 2000 to \n17.6% in 2016. Within agriculture, the significance of horticulture has grown as a result of \ndiversification from cotton and grain crops. The combined share of cotton and grain in agricultural \nGDP fell from 7.0% in 2000 to 4.7% in 2016, while the share of fruit and vegetables grew from \n5.2% to 10.6% over the same period. Significant increases in cropping area between 2000 and \n2016 have been recorded in vegetables (by 59%) and fruit and berries (by 37%). Over the same \nperiod, the area under grains increased by 5% and the area under industrial crops, predominantly \ncotton, fell by 12%. Increases in fruit and vegetable production were relatively higher than \nincreases in area because significant improvements were recorded in crop yields. The structure \nof agricultural exports is also shifting. Between 2010 and 2017, cotton exports fell from $1.58 \nbillion to $0.48 billion. Fruit and vegetable exports grew from $0.07 billion in 2000 to about $1.00 \nbillion in 2017. As of 2017, the share of fruit and vegetables in exports was double that of cotton.  \n \n4.  Constraints  and  opportunities.  Horticulture  production  has  traditionally  been \nconstrained by limited access to good quality land, specialized horticulture machinery, appropriate \ninputs, and finance. The horticulture value chain is characterized by rudimentary marketing and \ntransportation  infrastructure,  weak  linkages  between  value  chain  actors,  and  limited  and \ntechnologically poor storage and processing capacity. There is no strategic coordination of \nwholesale market activity at the national level. All fruit and vegetable markets are managed at the \nlocal level, which has given rise to a range of wholesale and retail market outlets of varying \ncapacities and levels of professionalism. These weaknesses are reflected in high levels of post-\n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance for Preparing the Horticulture Value \nChain  Infrastructure  Project.  ADB.  2017.  Technical  Assistance  for  Preparing  the  Horticulture  Value  Chain \nInfrastructure Project. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nharvest losses. At the national level, losses are estimated to be up to 30%, while in the two project \nregions  losses  are  estimated  at  21%  in  Andijan  and  29%  in  Samarkand. Together,  these \nconstraints limit value addition in fruit and vegetable products and export potential.  \n \n5.  Significantly larger volumes of produce of improved quality could be marketed with better \npost-harvest logistics, notably product consolidation, cold storage, and transport. Out of 21 million \ntons of total horticulture output, only 15% is processed. About 69.0% of fruit is consumed fresh, \n20.0% is processed, and 11.0% is exported, while 81.0% of vegetables are consumed fresh, \n11.3% are processed, 4.3% are used for seeds, and 3.4% are exported. This indicates a \nsignificant opportunity for improved value addition from increased processing and exports of both \nfresh and processed products. An analysis of Uzbekistan\u2019s revealed comparative advantage \nsuggests that the country is more specialized in producing horticultural products than many of the \nworld\u2019s producers, indicating the country\u2019s potential to expand its exports both in traditional \nmarkets of the Russian Federation and Central Asia and in newer European markets.2 However, \naccessing the European markets, especially the European Union, will require improvement in \nhorticulture quality and safety standards and certification systems. In this context, there is \nconsiderable scope to improve storage, processing, marketing and technologies. \n \n6.  Government\u2019s strategies. The current government policy in agriculture centers upon \nfurther diversification and modernization. In 2017, the government issued the Strategy of Actions \non Further Development of Uzbekistan, which includes a reduction of land for cotton and wheat \nproduction to expand horticulture production.3 The government policy in respect of horticulture is \nto facilitate development that is market driven by the private sector, and is supported by improved \naccess to finance and improved technologies, especially to facilitate greater value addition and \nrealization of export potential. The Strategy of Actions targeted the implementation of investment \nprojects for the construction of new processing plants and modernization of existing plants, with \nsuch plants to be equipped with modern high-technology equipment for deeper processing of \nagricultural products. In 2018, the government adopted additional measures to further support for \nthe horticulture sector and identifies a number of constraints that need to be addressed to enable \nhorticulture producers, processors, and traders to improve product quality and access to domestic \nand  international  markets. 4  In  this  regard,  the  government  gives  specific  focus  to  the \nreorganization of marketing and introduction of logistic centers.   \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners have supported \nagriculture and horticulture through a variety of projects and technical assistance. The World Bank \nis implementing a horticulture development project with total financing of $650 million (including \n$500  million  additional  financing  approved  in  January  2018).  The  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural Development is implementing a $30 million horticulture development project. Other \ndevelopment partners have also provided broad support to enhance the business environment \nand capacity building for financial institutions and small businesses.5 ADB has been implementing \nthe Horticulture Value Chain Development Project and its associated additional financing project.6 \n                                                \n2  ADB staff analysis based on the FAOSTAT data (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home).

These facilities will ensure stable and high-quality supply to the ALCs \nto be established in the proposed project. \n \n8.  The proposed project will complement and enhance the impact of projects financed by \nADB and other development partners. It will finance the establishment of two ALCs\u2014in Andijan \nand Samarkand regions\u2014that will strengthen upstream and downstream value chain linkages \nand provide modern post-harvest infrastructure. The ALCs will provide all necessary facilities and \nservices in one place: trading, storage, processing, food safety certification, customs clearance, \ntransport, shipping, marketing advisory services, trade finance, and commercial banking. The \nALCs will help address the current high levels of post-harvest losses and expand horticulture \nproduce  sales  in  domestic  and  export  markets.  In  particular,  it  will  introduce  post-harvest \nprocessing, storage, and handling following international quality and safety standards. The ALCs \nwill be the focal points of horticulture clusters to be established in Andijan and Samarkand and \nthe neighboring regions in accordance with Resolution UP-5388 (footnote 4). In addition to \nincreased sales volumes, the ALCs will smooth crop seasonality and enhance price transmission \nto and price stability for small-scale producers, and small and medium-sized agribusinesses. ALC \nlocations will be Andijan and Samarkand, where agro-climatic conditions are favorable to multiple \nfruit and vegetable crops per year. Together, Andijan and Samarkand account for 25% of the total \narea in Uzbekistan under horticulture crops and for 30% of the total national production. They \nhave large dehkan (small-scale farms) farmer populations, accounting for 22% of all dehkan \nfarmers  in  Uzbekistan,  who  will  benefit  from  increased  market  opportunities.  Andijan  and \nSamarkand have significant urban populations, are well-connected to other urban centers in \nUzbekistan, and are strategically located for access to export markets through highway, railway, \nand airport connections. \n \n9.  Lessons and value added by ADB assistance. Lessons call for (i) investing in modern \nproduction and post-harvest systems; (ii) establishing integrated infrastructure including post-\nharvest handling, storage, processing, certification, market information, and logistics capacity to \npromote sustainable exports; (iii) engaging all key horticulture value chain actors in clusters to \npromote horizontal and vertical integration; and (iv) operating infrastructure according to the user-\npays principle to generate revenue.7 Together with ADB assistance under the Horticulture Value \nChain Development Project and its additional financing, the project will add significant value by \npromoting the development of holistic horticulture value chain clusters (footnote 6). The ALCs are \ndesigned to be financially sustainable with all facilities being leased out to private sector users \nand operators under the overall professional management of the ALC management company. As \nsuch,  overall  economic  efficiency  gains  will  be  increased,  price  transmission  to  producers \nimproved, and the state fiscal burden reduced. Moreover, the project will be a significant initiative \nto enhance entrepreneurship in horticulture and job creation. In this regard, the project business \nmodel has high potential for replication in all major horticulture production regions of Uzbekistan \nand other subsectors such as meat and dairy.  \n \n10.  The project supports the government\u2019s development strategy for 2017\u20132021 which aims \nto accelerate economic growth, promote private sector development, diversify and commercialize \nagriculture, and address regional disparity (footnote 3). The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n7  These are the key success factors based on lessons learnt from the two most successful agro-logistic models in the \nworld, namely the wholesale market and logistic network managed by Mercasa of Spain, and the Rungis wholesale \nmarket managed by Semmaris of France. \n ", "4 \n \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  Uzbekistan  which  supports  the  government\u2019s \neconomic diversification strategy and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2017\u20132020.8  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: contribution of the horticulture sector to \ninclusive economic growth and rural employment improved.9 The project will have the following \noutcome: production and value addition of horticulture products increased.10 \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: Agro-logistic centers established. Output 1 comprises the establishment of \nan ALC at Andijan with (i) about 25,000 square meters of trading area split evenly between \nwholesale and small farmer sales areas with an annual throughput of about 425,000 tons; (ii) \nabout 60,000 cubic meters of cold storage with an annual capacity of up to 1.5 million tons; (iii) \n12 processing lines with an approximate annual throughput of 600,000 tons for export and 80,000 \ntons for the domestic market; and (iv) provision of groundworks for future expansion of the ALC \nfor an increased volume of horticulture produce and/or trading, storage, and processing of \nalternative food products. The ALC at Andijan will be located in Andijan district away from but well \nconnected  to  Andijan  city.  The  site  is  located  on  National  Highway  4P112  and  A373 \n(Tashkent\uf02dFergana Valley road) and opposite the airport. It is in the center of the major production \nareas of Andijan region of Andijan, Asaka, Jalalkuduk, Pakhtaabad, and Shakhrihon districts. It is \nalso well-located for access to and from neighboring regions of Fergana and Namangan, and to \nexport destinations. The identified site covers a gross area of 51.43 ha, of which 40.90 ha will be \ndeveloped under the proposed project and the remaining area is reserved for future expansion.  \n \n13.  Output 1 also includes the establishment of an ALC at Samarkand with (i) about 35,600 \nsquare meters of trading area split evenly between wholesale and small farmer sales areas with \nan annual throughput of about 550,000 tons; (ii) about 60,000 cubic meters of cold storage with \nan annual capacity of up to 1.5 million tons; (iii) 17 processing lines with an approximate annual \nthroughput of 850,000 tons for export and 150,000 tons for the domestic market; and (iv) provision \nof groundworks for future expansion of the ALC for an increased volume of horticulture produce \nand/or trading, storage, and processing of alternative food products. The ALC at Samarkand will \nbe located in Jomboy district with good connection to Samarkand city. It is on National Highway \nM39 connecting Samarkand with Tashkent and is close to Samarkand airport. The location in \nJomboy will enable traders from southern regions of Surkandarya and Kashkadarya to avoid \npassing through Samarkand city, thereby avoiding traffic congestion in the city. It is in the center \nof the major production areas of Samarkand region of Bulungur, Jomboy, Samarkand, Toyloq, \nand Urgut districts.

The RRA, through the PMO, will recruit the PSC as \nan international firm using the quality- and cost-based selection (90:10) method in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The PMO and the \nPSC will assist the ALC management company in recruiting a turnkey contractor to design and \nconstruct the ALCs. The ALC management company will supervise the detailed design and \nconstruction with assistance of the PMO and the PSC.  \n                                                \n14 The climate finance was estimated on the basis of the project conceptual design. The adaptation cost of $20 million \nwas based on the investment cost of processing lines while the mitigation cost of $30 million was based on the \ninvestment cost of cold storage facilities. A detailed assessment of climate risks, mitigation and adaptation measures \nwill be undertaken once ALCs detailed designs are finalized to provide a firm basis for reporting climate finance \nduring project implementation. ", "7 \n \n21.  Operation of the agro-logistic centers and private sector participation. The ALC \nmanagement company will operate and manage the ALCs on commercial and cost-recovery \nprinciples. The ALC management company will lease out the ALC facilities to private sector users \nand/or operators under the user-pays principle. Prospective private sector clients will include \nproducers (farmers), processors, traders, exporters, and other support service providers such as \ntransport companies, banks, insurance companies, and brokerage houses. With all post-harvest \nactivities taking place within the premises, the ALCs will help strengthen linkages among value \nchain actors (both upstream and downstream) and increase efficiency gains and value addition \nalong the horticulture value chain.  \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 12). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 January 2019\u201331 December 2023 \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Rural Restructuring Agency  \n(ii)  Key implementing  Ministry for Foreign Trade and ALC management company \nagencies \n(iii)  Implementation unit  PMO under Rural Restructuring Agency, about 30 staff \nProcurementa  International competitive  1 contract (turnkey  $213.570 \nbidding for ALCs establishment  contract, with 2 lots)  million \nShopping for PMO equipment,  4 contracts  $0.121 million \nvehicles, and furniture \nConsulting servicesa  QCBS for PSC  314 person-months  $4.480 million \nLCS for financial auditing  50 person-months  $0.280 million \nRetroactive financing  Advance recruitment actions for PSC will be required to expedite \nand/or advance contracting  implementation startup.  \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ALC = agro-logistic center, LCS = least cost selection, PMO = project management \noffice, PSC = project supervision consultant, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na   All procurement of goods and works will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The ALCs are an innovative concept in promoting Uzbek horticulture, in which several \nvalue chain functions (sales, storage, processing, certification, customs clearance, and support \nservices) are housed in a single location. This will facilitate the smooth flow of produce from \nproducer  to  consumer  through  investment  in  modern  product  handling  technologies  and \nprofessional ALC management. This will address current issues relating to post-harvest losses \nand environmental concerns surrounding existing horticulture marketing systems. Each ALC will \nbe the focal point of horticulture clusters in Andijan, Samarkand, and their neighboring regions, in ", "8 \n \naccordance with the government policy for the sector. Given the ALCs\u2019 roles as mega-clusters for \nhorticulture while promoting quality and safety of horticultural produce and enhancing branding \nand marketing for Uzbek exports, project financing from the public finance window is fully justified.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The proposed project will help improve horticultural productivity and value addition in line \nwith  the  government  strategy.  By  addressing  the  constraint  on  post-harvest  handling  and \nprocessing in horticulture, it will facilitate and spur investment in intensive energy- and water-\nefficient technologies for fruit and vegetable production, storage, processing, and marketing \nfacilities. This will increase the volume and enhance the quality of Uzbek horticultural produce for \nboth domestic and export markets.  \n \n25.  The Andijan and Samarkand ALCs will contribute significantly to the national economy \nthrough both direct and indirect benefits. Direct benefits include (i) revenue from the rental of \nmarket trading areas to wholesalers and small farmers, (ii) post-harvest processing facilities for a \nrange of fruit and vegetable products, (iii) cold storage and frozen storage rented on a daily and \nmonthly basis, and (iv) floor space in the ALCs\u2019 administration building. These direct benefits are \nquantified and included in the financial and economic benefit\u2013cost estimations. The project will \nhave both short- and long-term indirect benefits though not readily quantifiable. Short-term indirect \nbenefits include the increase in economic activity that will be generated during the construction of \nthe ALCs. Long-term indirect benefits include (i) the reduction in post-harvest losses; (ii) the \nincrease in exports of fruit and vegetable products; (iii) efficiencies gained in the fruit and \nvegetable value chain; and (iv) more transparent price discovery and formation and stabilization \nof fruit and vegetable prices throughout the year. The financial and economic analysis of the two \nproject  sites  indicates  that  such  investments  are  both  financially  and  economically  viable. \nFinancial internal rates of return are 18.4% for the Andijan ALC and 18.5% for the Samarkand \nALC, both well above the assumed discount rate of 5.5%.15 Economic rates of return are 16.6% \nfor the Andijan ALC and 16.8% for the Samarkand ALC, both well above the economic viability \ncut-off rate of 9.0%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that both ALC cash flows are robust with \nrespect to potentially adverse movements in revenue and cost streams.16 \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The overall pre-mitigation financial management and procurement risks are classified \nmoderate. A financial management assessment of the RRA did not identify any issues that would \nadversely affect its project management role. The financial management assessment of MFT \nindicated that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. Key risks requiring \nactions by the MFT includes: (i) MFT staff are not experienced in managing ADB projects and in \nADB procedures, (ii) there is a lack of accounting staff trained and certified in international public \nsector accounting standards, (iii) fixed assets are not properly registered and labeled with \ninventory numbers, (iv) there is no internal audit function in place, and (v) there is no risk \nmanagement function in place. Corresponding financial management actions to address the \nstated risks are outlined in the PAM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the RRA, and the MFT. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n                                                \n15 The project weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 3.7%. However, the average lending interest rate for \nthe United States dollar at the financial institutions participating in the Horticulture Value Chain Development Project \n(Loan 3471-UZB) is 5.5%. Therefore, the rate of 5.5% was used as the financial discount rate in lieu of 3.7% to \nprovide conservative estimates of financial net present values and ensure the robustness of the financial cashflows. \n16 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "9 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n27.  The  project  supports  poverty  reduction  indirectly  through  horticulture  value  chain \ndevelopment. With 32% of the total workforce in agriculture, the proposed project will help many \nhorticulture farmers and entrepreneurs boost their investments, maintain and expand employment, \nand provide stable incomes for themselves and their employees and suppliers. The proposed \nproject is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The expected key outcomes of the project \ngender action plan are (i) enhanced female entrepreneurship in horticulture businesses, and (ii) \nincreased  participation  of  female  workers  in  the  horticulture  sector.17 ADB  conducted  due \ndiligence and confirmed that core labor standards were complied with in the horticulture sector.18 \nThe loan and project agreements include covenants on labor standards and safety. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n29.  Environment (category B). Environmental impacts from the project are expected to be \nminimal in magnitude and site specific and include dust and waste generation, noise and vibration, \nand transportation of construction materials. Environmental impacts during the operational phase \ninclude solid waste and impacts on surface and ground water sources and impacts arising from \nthe increased goods transport traffic. The RRA prepared two initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) for the two sites (Andijan and Samarkand) and conducted public consultation meetings.  \nThe  IEEs  included  mitigation  measures  for  construction  and  operational  impacts  in  the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). ADB disclosed the IEEs were disclosed on its website \nin September 2018. These impacts could be mitigated by proper implementation of mitigation \nmeasures developed in the EMPs. The RRA\u2019s PMO will be responsible for implementation of the \nEMPs to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguards requirements and national regulations.20 \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will require permanent acquisition of \nabout 130 ha of land (51.43 ha in Andijan and 78.00 ha in Samarkand). A total of 63 households \nwill be affected, of which eight households will experience severe impact on their livelihood, and \nnone of the households were found to belong to any vulnerable groups. The RRA prepared land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for both project sites to mitigate and address all the \nassociated losses in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and national legislation. \nADB disclosed the LARPs on its website in September 2018. When the project design is finalized, \nor additional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, the RRA will \nupdate the LARPs in accordance with applicable laws and obtain approval from ADB prior to any \nfurther implementation. All displaced people will receive compensation in accordance with the \nLARP provisions. The land required for the project will be made free of encumbrances prior to \ncommencement of construction.21 \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Uzbekistan is inhabited by ethnic groups across all \nits  12  regions  and  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan.  None  of  these groups  are  considered \nindigenous peoples as defined in the Safeguard Policy Statement for operational purposes.  \n                                                \n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Detailed Social and Gender Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB.
