The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u2013\n2006 for Pakistan1 noted that the delivery of social services, which since 2001 has been a \nresponsibility of local governments, is showing promising signs of improvement. ADB\u2019s support \nto social sectors continues through the devolved social services programs, which are designed \nto ensure effective and equitable distribution of resources to local governments for education, \nhealth,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS).  ADB\u2019s  strategic  focus  on  governance  will \ncontinue and will be mainstreamed as a cross-cutting issue in the devolved social services \nprograms.  The  2005  program  includes  the  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(BDSSP) loan and technical assistance (TA) for Balochistan Capacity Building for Devolved \nSocial Services.2 The proposed BDSSP will support policy reforms to strengthen devolved \nsocial services, expand performance grants for district governments, and support a TA loan to \nfacilitate policy reforms. The government of Balochistan (GOB) has asked ADB for a TA to \nenhance and strengthen the capacity of both the provincial and local governments to undertake \nand  accelerate  social  sector  policy  reforms,  strengthen  the  mainstreaming  of  governance \nreforms in the social sectors, and implement performance grants under the proposed BDSSP.  \n \n2.  The TA resources are limited in relation to the tasks to be accomplished. It is expected \nthat the momentum generated through the proposed TA will be sustained and scaled up with \nthe help of a TA loan being built into the proposed BDSSP. The TA\u2019s objectives, inputs, and \nimplementation  arrangements  are  based  on  extensive  discussion  with  GOB  and  other \nstakeholders  during  the  Fact-Finding  and  Appraisal  Missions  for  the  BDSSP  in  July  and \nSeptember 2005 (Appendix 1). The government agreed with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The province of Balochistan seems to be largely untouched by the buoyant economic \ngrowth  witnessed  in  Pakistan  in  recent  years.  A  number  of  factors  are  responsible  for \nBalochistan\u2019s  economic  backwardness  and  its  inability  to  capitalize  on  Pakistan\u2019s  overall \neconomic growth, including its physical geography and poor human development indicators. \nBalochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest province, accounting for nearly 45% of the country\u2019s surface \narea, with a thinly dispersed population of around 6.5 million.  \n \n4.  Rapid improvement in human capital is essential for Balochistan if it is to tap the benefits \nof global, market-driven economic growth. Despite making progress in education and health \nindicators, these indicators nevertheless remain among the lowest in South Asia: girls\u2019 net \nenrollment in primary school, for example, remains at slightly more than 20%. In addition, \ngeographical, cultural, ethnic, historical, political, and other factors have interplayed to pose \ngovernance and institutional challenges that have major implications for the quality of social \nservice delivery. Thus Balochistan needs social sector governance reforms and institutional \nstrengthening to improve the effectiveness of both public and private social service delivery.  \n \n5.  GOB is determined to pursue a robust course of economic and human development as \narticulated in the Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Local Government Ordinance \n2001 has created institutional opportunities for improving social service delivery through the \ninvolvement  of  local  governments  and  communities;  however,  policy  reforms,  institutional \nstrengthening, and capacity building of both district and facility managers and service providers \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006. Manila. ADB \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 August 2005.  \n ", "2   \nof education, health and water supply and sanitation sectors are essential to improve devolved \nsocial services. The proposed BDSSP has four principal policy areas, namely: (i) strengthening \nand  clarify  relationships  between  provincial  and  local  governments,  (ii)  strengthening  the \nrelationship between local governments and social service providers, (iii) strengthening the \nrelationship between citizens and policy makers and between citizens and service providers in \norder to empower the public; and (iv) enabling the private sector to engage in social service \ndelivery. \n \n6.  A TA loan of $5 million is built into the BDSSP to provide support for implementation, \ncapacity building, and policy reforms; however, this TA loan is unlikely to become available until \nthe second half of 2006.3 The first tranche actions, as well as advance actions pertaining to the \nproper implementation of performance grants, including measures to mitigate fiduciary risks and \nensure proper financial management of devolved social services, need to be undertaken as \nsoon as possible and before June 2006. Without such advance actions, the launch of the \nBDSSP is likely to encounter start-up delays. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  proposed  TA  will  improve  the  capacity  of  GOB  and  of  local  governments  to \nstrengthen  devolved  social  services,  thereby  accelerating  progress  toward  meeting  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  relating  to  education,  health,  and  WSS  (Appendix  1).  The \noutcomes of the TA will be to (i) support GOB and local governments in undertaking policy \nreforms to improve devolved social services, especially those linked to first tranche actions of \nthe BDSSP; (ii) support the implementation of performance grants under the proposed BDSSP \nin education, health, and WSS, including implementation of the public expenditure tracking \nsurvey (PETS) and quantitative service delivery survey (QSDS); and (iii) support GOB in taking \nadvance actions to ensure timely implementation of the proposed BDSSP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA, which will be spread over 12 months of implementation, will consist of the \nfollowing  four  components:  (i)  support  for  timely  implementation  of  first  tranche  actions \nproposed under the BDSSP, (ii) support for performance grant implementation, (iii) support for \nthe development of PETS and QSDS, and for pilot testing PETS in one local government, and \n(iv) support for taking advance actions and implementation support for the initial period of the \nBDSSP. These components will be achieved through (i) consultant support; (ii) support to \nundertake survey; (iii) capacity building for performance grant implementation; and (iv) other \nsupport, including support for developing a BDSSP web site, publishing reports, and so on.  \n \n9.  Support for Implementing First Tranche Actions under the BDSSP. A number of first \ntranche actions of the BDSSP require technical support, including (i) for developing a strategy \nfor rationalizing the roles and staffing of social sector departments; (ii) for empowering district \ngovernments in relation to services and general administration; (iii) for developing an incentive \nsystem  for  sector  managers  and  service  delivery  staff;  (iv)  for  developing  facility  specific, \nnonregularizable contract appointments; (v) for developing human development actions plans \nfor social sector district and facility managers and service providers; (vi) for strengthening WSS \n                                                 \n3 The TA loan is expected to be effective around March to May 2006, but despite advance actions, experience \nsuggests that the consultant support provided by the TA loan will not be available before June 2006 even under the \nbest-case scenario. \n ", "  3\nmanagement information systems; (vii) for framing a communications strategy for strengthening \ncommunity involvement in the management of social sector facilities; (viii) for formulating sector \nstrategies, minimum standards, and expenditure norms; and (ix) for developing guidelines for \nhospital management boards.  \n \n10.  Support  for  Performance  Grant  Implementation.  Both  the  Balochistan  Resource \nManagement Program and the BDSSP will provide support for devolved social sectors through \nthe performance grants mechanism (Appendix 2). The performance grants are to help eligible \ndistrict governments and selected tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) accelerate progress \ntoward achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in education, health and WSS within \nthe broad policy reform framework agreed on with GOB. Performance grants will be allocated in \naccordance with the formula agreed to under the provincial Finance Commission award for \ndistributing  resources  between  districts  and  TMAs.  The  administration  of  the  performance \ngrants will follow the implementation arrangements specified under the Balochistan performance \ngrant rules 2005. The administrative processes pertaining to performance grants are elaborate, \nand capacity building is required, especially training on the administration of performance grants \nat the district level, as is support for the provincial Finance Department for setting up systems \nfor implementing the performance grants. \n \n11.  The TA support for performance grants proposed under the BDSSP will be threefold. \nFirst, the TA will support the establishment of a program unit in the Finance Department of GOB \nfor implementing the performance grants by means of consultant support for one year. Second, \nthe TA will support the hiring of an international governance and institutional development \nconsultant and a domestic finance specialist to (i) design systems for administering performance \ngrants, especially for mitigating fiduciary risks; (ii) prepare training materials for performance \ngrant training; and (iii) conduct training workshops for district government and TMA officials and \norient district councils on performance grants. Third, the TA will provide support for organizing \ntraining programs for district government and TMA officials on performance grants in all the 28 \ndistricts. The international consultant will also develop an action plan for capacity building and \nstrengthening of the provincial Bureau of Statistics. \n \n12.  Support for the Development of PETS and the QSDS, and for Pilot Testing PETS. A \nfeature of the BDSSP is the inclusion of two surveys, PETS and QSDS, for strengthening the \nmonitoring mechanism for social service delivery funded by performance grants (see Appendix \n2 for more details). Traditional monitoring of service delivery has focused almost entirely on the \nfinancial aspect of service delivery, for example, examining whether a government spends its \nmoney on the right goods and the right people by looking at budget data. However, PETS and \nthe QSDS pay more attention to service provision, particularly issues related to institutions, \nincentives,  and  service  provider  behavior.  These  survey  tools  can  provide  a  better \nunderstanding  of  the  behavior  of  frontline  service  providers  and  the  relationship  between \nproviders, policy makers, and service users. The TA will provide international consultant support \nto design PETS and the QSDS and to fund a pilot survey of PETS in one local government.  \n \n13.  Support  for  Implementation  of  the  BDSSP.  The  BDSSP  is  expected  to  become \neffective in the first half of 2006, and the first tranche, subject to fulfillment of all the first tranche \nconditions, is expected to be released around June 2006. Even with advance actions, the \nsupport  available  from  the  BDSPP  TA  loan  will  be  difficult  to  tap  before  October  2006. \nImplementation support for the BDSSP is needed to coordinate first tranche actions, support \nadvance actions for recruiting consultant support provided under the TA loan, and coordinate \nthe  pilot  PETS  survey.  The  TA  will  provide  12  person-months  of  consultant support  by  a \nprogram  manager  who  will  help  the  provincial  Program  Office  coordinate  various  types of \n ", "4   \nsupport provided under the TA, in addition to initiating advance actions for the BDSSP. A \nprocurement specialist will be provided under the TA to help implement advance actions for \nprocuring goods and services, and hiring consultants under the TA loan. In addition, the TA will \nprovide support for developing a web site for the BDSSP and for other administrative costs. For \n3 to 6 months, the program manager\u2019s tenure will intersect with the initial phase of TA loan \nimplementation, which will ensure a smooth transition and sustain the momentum generated by \nthe TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA, including contingencies, is estimated at $400,000 equivalent, of \nwhich the ADB will finance $300,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA Funding \nProgram to cover all the foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency costs, mainly for \ndomestic consultants. GOB will contribute 25% of the total cost of the TA (Appendix 3).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Balochistan Planning and Development Department will be the executing agency for \nthe TA. The Steering Committee established under program preparatory TA for the BDSSP will \ncontinue  as  the  Steering  Committee  for  the proposed  TA.  Chaired by  the  additional  chief \nsecretary,  development,  the  Steering  Committee  consists  of  representatives  from  GOB\u2019s  \ndepartments  of  Finance,  Education,  Local  Government,  Health,  Public  Health  Engineering, \nServices  and  General  Administration;  from  district  governments  and  TMAs;  and  from \nnongovernment  organizations.  At  least  two  members  must  be  women.  The  committee  will \ncontinue to meet at least once every two months to monitor the progress of the TA and ensure \nthat advance actions for the proposed BDSSP are undertaken in a timely fashion. The Finance \nDepartment will be the implementing agency for that part of the TA relating to performance \ngrants. As the executing and implementing agencies are the same for this TA and the proposed \nTA loan under the BDSSP, the likelihood of any duplication will be curtailed.  \n \n16.  The TA is expected to commence by 1 December 2005, to be implemented over a \nperiod of 12 months, and to close by 30 November 2006. The consultants will prepare an \ninception report within 2 weeks of the commencement of services, which will provide a detailed \nwork program and establish time-bound outputs. In addition to any reports required at the end of \neach individual assignment, the program manager will submit monthly progress reports. The \nfinal report, including complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted within one month \nof the end of the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA will require about 61 person-months of consulting services, including 6 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  55  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. All consultants will be hired on individual basis. Appendix 4  provides outline terms \nof reference for the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Balochistan Capacity Building for Devolved Social Services, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthened devolved social  (cid:131) Improvement in indicators of  (cid:131)  Household  (cid:131) Political commitment for \nservices in Balochistan lead to  Millennium Development  surveys and  devolved social services \naccelerated progress toward  Goals pertaining to primary  facility surveys   \nachievement of the Millennium  education, health, and water  Risk \nDevelopment Goals relating to  supply and sanitation by  (cid:131) Political risks at the \neducation, health, and water  10% from the baseline  provincial and local \nsupply and sanitation   (2005) by 2010  government levels \nOutcome      Assumption \nReforms for strengthening  (cid:131) The first tranche actions of  (cid:131) Reports from the  (cid:131) Reforms lead to \ndevolved social services  the BDSSP achieved by May  provincial  increased efficiency and \nundertaken   2006  Program Office   effectiveness and \n(cid:131) Performance grants released  (cid:131) Monthly reports  improved quality \nto most district governments  by the program   \nby May 2006  manager  Risk \n(cid:131) Delay in initiating \nperformance grants \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.

PERFORMANCE GRANTS \n \n1.  Introduction.  Performance  grants  under  the  proposed  Balochistan  Devolved  Social \nServices Program (BDSSP) will be given to district governments as nonmatching grants to \nachieve progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals and the goals of the \nBalochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper pertaining to education, health, and water supply \nand sanitation.  \n \n2.  Administration  Process.  The  administration  of  the  performance  grants  under  the \nBDSSP will follow the Balochistan performance grant rules 2005, which lay out the process as \nfollows: (i) the government of Balochistan (GOB) makes a public announcement and notification \nof the performance grants; (ii) the secretariat of the provincial Finance Commission circulates \neligibility criteria and contract conditions for performance grants to district governments; (iii) \ndistrict  governments  send  eligibility  certificates  and  documents  to  the  secretariat  of  the \nprovincial Finance Commission; (iv) the secretariat scrutinizes the documents received from \ndistrict  governments  and  requests  additional  information  as  required;  (v)  the  district \ngovernments provide requested additional information; (vi) the secretariat  lists eligible district \ngovernments and invites them to complete contractual formalities; (vii) the district governments \ncomplete  contractual  formalities;  (viii)  the  provincial  Finance  Department  obtains  monthly \nexpenditure  reports  and  quarterly  progress  reports  from  district  governments;  and  (ix)  the \nprovincial government monitors performance grants through its sector line departments.  \n \n3.  Distribution  Formula.  The  funds  will  be  allocated  among  all  eligible  district \ngovernments in accordance with the formula established by the provincial Finance Commission.  \n \n4.  Fund Disbursement, Monitoring, Reporting, and Auditing. The Performance grants \nunder the BDSSP will be disbursed by GOB to district governments in one installment or in \nquarterly installments in accordance with the grant rules. Grants will be monitored principally by \nmeans of the mechanisms and systems specified in the grant rules, that is: (i) annual monitoring \nof allocations, programs, and  works by the relevant provincial sector department; (ii) monitoring \nby the relevant offices and monitoring committees of district governments; and (iii) special \nmonitoring by the Finance Department when quarterly progress reports are unsatisfactory.  \n \n5.  Through the proposed BDSSP, program units in district governments will review the \nreports of the monitoring committees of the union level and the Program Unit in the Finance \nDepartment will review the reports of the district councils\u2019 monitoring committees. In addition, to \nstrengthen monitoring and evaluation of performance grants, GOB plans to (i) introduce a public \nexpenditure tracking survey, (ii) introduce a quantitative service delivery survey, and (iii) pilot a \ncitizen report card to obtain public perceptions of the quality of service delivery. The BDSSP will \nprovide technical assistance to develop these mechanisms and support their implementation. \nUnder their terms of partnership agreements with GOB, district governments are required to \nfacilitate these surveys. These will be used to help evaluate the BDSSP\u2019s outputs.  \n \n6.  Reports submitted by the district governments will include monthly financial reports and \ndetailed expenditure statements for each category of grant submitted to the provincial Finance \nCommission Secretariat and the Finance Department and quarterly progress reports. The latter \nwill cover the financial situation and implementation progress and provide a detailed expenditure \n ", "          Appendix 2  7 \nstatement for each category of grant, to be submitted to the provincial Finance Commission \nSecretariat. Annual progress reports will be submitted to the provincial Finance Commission \nSecretariat  and  the  provincial  Finance  Department.  The  provincial  Finance  Commission \nSecretariat will consolidate all the reports of all the district governments into a single database \nand  prepare  an  annual  report  on  performance  grants.  The  BDSSP  Program  Unit  in  the \nprovincial  Finance  Department  will  use  the  various  reports  to  track  the  use  of  funds  and \nimplementation progress. Audits of BDSSP performance grants will be in accordance with \nGOB\u2019s  rules  and  requirements.  This  includes  internal  audits  by  district  governments  and \nexternal audits by the auditor general of Pakistan.  \n \n \nB.  PUBLIC  EXPENDITURE  TRACKING  AND  QUANTITATIVE  SERVICE  DELIVERY \nSURVEYS \n \n7.  When  used  as  indicators  of  the  supply  of  public  services  in  countries  with  poor \naccountability and weak institutions, budget allocations are poor proxies for the actual quantity \nand quality of public services delivered. Even if a government spends its money on the right \ngoods and the right people, the link between spending and its transformation into services may \nbe broken in two ways. First, public funds earmarked for certain purposes may not reach \nfrontline service providers, thus the public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) is intended to \ntrack the flow of funds through to service providers. Second, even when funds reach frontline \nservice providers, they may not have enough incentives to deliver services, for example, service \nproviders may be poorly paid and be insufficiently monitored, which can give rise to such \nproblems as excessive absenteeism. Thus the quantitative service delivery survey (QSDS) goes \nbeyond PETS to examine the efficacy of spending, incentives, and oversight. \n \n8.  Government  funds  earmarked  for  particular  purpose  flow  within  a  legally  defined \ninstitutional  framework.  The  funds  usually  pass  through  several  layers  of  government \nbureaucracy before reaching service providers, which take a primary responsibility for spending \nthe  funds.  In  developing  countries,  policy  makers  seldom  have  information  about  actual \nspending at the service provider level. PETS, a survey that is frequently conducted as part of \npublic expenditure reviews, aims at tracking the flow of funds to service providers to clarify the \nextent to which service providers actually receive funds allocated for certain purposes. It is \ntherefore a useful tool for identifying and quantifying political and bureaucratic capture and \nleakage of funds. PETS, which targets frontline providers (schools, clinics, and their staff) and \nlocal  governments  (politicians  and  officials)  needs  to  be  complemented  by  financial  data \npertaining to higher levels of government. \n \n9.  PETS provides information about the outputs and actions of service providers, and \nthereby generates information pertaining to policy makers and beneficiaries in relation to the \ncomplex process whereby public funds are used to provide services. When tailored to specific \ncircumstances,  PETS  can  help  identify  incentives  and  shed  light  on  the  interactions  the \nincentives give rise to, such as collusion and bribery. It can also reveal information about the \npolitical economy, such as the effects of various interest groups on spending outcomes.  \n \n10.  The World Bank pioneered PETS in Uganda in 1996, motivated by the observation that \ndespite a substantial increase in budget allocations to education, the school enrollment rate had \nnot improved. The survey found that, on average, only 13% of the budgeted funds actually \nreached schools in 1991\u20131995 and that the remaining 87% had disappeared into private hands \nor had been captured by local officials for other purposes. Another finding was that about 20% \nof funds intended for teachers\u2019 salaries was paid to \u201cghost\u201d teachers, that is, teachers who never \n ", "8  Appendix 2   \n \nappeared in classrooms. Following the survey, the Government of Uganda implemented an \ninformation campaign to disseminate information about fund transfers to schools, which resulted \nin a sharp drop in the leakages. \n \n11.  The QSDS is a variant of PETS that collects data on inputs, outputs, quality, pricing, and \noversight. Its primary objective is to examine the efficiency of public expenditures and the \nincentives of service providers.  \n \n12.  Implemented in Bangladesh in 2002, staff involved in the QSDS made unannounced \nvisits to health clinics. The objective was to check what proportion of the staff was actually \npresent. The survey found that, on average, 26% of vacancies for all types of medical service \nproviders were not filled and that absentee rates were as high as 40%.  \n \n13.  In general, data should be collected as close as possible to their original sources. Data \nare  collected  from  records  maintained  by  service  providers  for  their  own  use.  A  critical \ncomponent of PETS and the QSDS is the explicit recognition that respondents have incentives \nto misreport certain information because such information partly determines their entitlement to \npublic support. In particular, those involved in corruption are the most unlikely to provide truthful \nanswers to surveys. PETS and the QSDS deal with this difficulty by (i) collecting data from a \nvariety of sources, and (ii) assessing which respondents have incentives to provide inaccurate \ninformation so as to identify which data sources are the least contaminated by such incentives. \nThe success of both surveys depends critically on careful survey arrangements with enough \nattention paid to the respondents\u2019 incentives.  \n \n14.  PETS and the QSDS require considerable effort, funding, and time, therefore limiting \nthem to one or two sectors is reasonable. To date they have mostly been conducted in the \nhealth and education sectors, which have clearly defined frontline service delivery points (clinics \nand schools).  \n \n15.  PETS  and  the  QSDS  consist  of  questionnaires  for  interviews  with  frontline  service \nmanagers and staff and separate data sheets for collecting quantitative data from their records. \nThe questionnaires consider six core elements as follows: \n(i)  Characteristics of the facility. Survey staff record the facility\u2019s size; ownership; \nyears in service; hours of operation; catchment area population; competition from \nother service providers; access to infrastructure, utilities, and other services; and \nrange of services provided. Information about income levels and other features of \nthe population living in the vicinity of the facility may also be useful. \n(ii)  Inputs.  Because  service  providers  typically  have  a  large  number  of  inputs, \ncollecting data on all of them may not be feasible. Some inputs are typically more \nimportant than others, for example, labor and drugs account for 80\u201390% of costs \nin a typical primary health care facility. In addition, there may be important capital \ninvestments. The key point in relation to measuring inputs is that they need to be \nvalued in monetary terms. Where monetary values are not readily available, this \nrequires careful and consistent recording of quantities and the assembly of price \ninformation, for example, staff wages and allowances, for each key input. \n(iii)  Outputs. Examples of measurable outputs include number of inpatients and \noutpatients  treated,  enrollment  rates,  and  numbers  of  pupils  passing    final \nexaminations. Unlike inputs, outputs rarely convert to monetary values as public \n ", "          Appendix 2  9 \nservices are often free or subsidized. Efficiency studies frequently use hybrid \ninput-output measures, such as the cost per patient. \n(iv)  Quality. Quality is multidimensional, and survey staff should attempt to capture \nthis  multidimensionality  by  collecting  information  about  different  aspects  of \nquality. Examples include observed practices, staff behavior and composition, \navailability of crucial inputs, and provision of certain services such as laboratory \ntesting. Information collected from users can also capture aspects of quality. \n(v)  Financing.  Survey  staff  should  collect  information  on  sources  of  finance, \namounts, and type (in-kind versus financial support). \n(vi)  Institutional mechanisms and accountability. Public facilities do not face the \nsame competitive pressures as private facilities. Instead, they are subject to \nsupervision and monitoring by central, regional, or local government institutions; \ncivil society; political leaders; and the press. That means collecting information \nabout supervision visits, management structures, reporting and record-keeping \npractices, parent or patient involvement, and audits. \n \n16.  The surveys conducted so far have shown that budget allocations do not by themselves \nguarantee  improved  service  delivery.  The  two  major  problems  are  leakages  of  funds  and \nabsenteeism by service providers. A policy lesson derived from the observations is that the \nweak links in accountability mechanisms must be identified and made the focus of reforms. To \nmaximize the benefits of PETS and the QSDS, governments need to disseminate their results \nwidely and remain committed to transparency in relation to fund allocation and the use of \nresources. In particular, sharing information with the public is key for improving service delivery. \nSetting up better monitoring systems to prevent absenteeism is also important. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 3   \n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign Local  Total\nItem  Exchange Currency  Cost\nA.
