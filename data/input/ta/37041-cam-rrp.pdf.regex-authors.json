The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on 31 January 2006. \n   \nProject Description  Sihanoukville, Cambodia\u2019s only deep-sea port, is a fast-growing \ncity  with  major  ongoing  developments  to  (i)  expand  the  port \nfacilities,  (ii)  upgrade  the  airport,  and  (iii)  set  up  an  export \nprocessing zone, thus making Sihanoukville an import gateway to \nthe  southern  economic  corridor.  No  power  transmission  grid \nconnects Sihanoukville to the national grid. The city gets its power \nfrom a small, isolated power system based on diesel generators. \nThis mode of power generation is expensive, inefficient, as it does \nnot achieve economies of scale, and cannot meet the demand. \nThe  Project  will  complement  previous  investments  in  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  facilities.  It  will  (i)  extend  the \n230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line from Kampot to Sihanoukville, \n(ii) build  associated  substations  and  bulk  supply  distribution \nfacilities, and (iii) carry out institutional development and capacity \nbuilding for Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC). \n   \nRationale  The  power  sector  in  Cambodia  is  highly  fragmented,  with  24 \nisolated power systems centered on the various provincial cities. \nThe  lack  of  an  integrated  high-voltage  transmission  system, \ncoupled  with  the  high  cost  of  imported  diesel  fuel,  has  made \nelectricity  in  Cambodia  among  the  costliest  in  the  world.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  the  high  cost  of  electricity  and \ninadequate supply significantly limits economic growth and hinder \nthe country from attracting investments and stimulating economic \nactivities. ADB and other development partners are assisting the \nGovernment in building 230 kV backbone transmission lines in the \nsouthern part of the country, originating at a substation on the \nborder with Viet Nam and passing through Takeo to Kampot and \nalso to Phnom Penh. These facilities will allow EDC to import \nlower-cost electricity from Viet Nam at $0.05\u2013$0.07 per kilowatt-\nhour  (kWh)  (at  off-peak  and  peak  hours)  to  meet  the  power \ndemand  in  Phnom  Penh,  Takeo,  Kampot,  and,  ultimately, \nSihanoukville. ", "ii   \n  The transmission lines and distribution facilities to be built under \nthe  Project  are  priority  investments  in  the  planned  national \nbackbone power grid included in EDC\u2019s transmission master plan. \nBy extending the transmission line and distribution systems, the \nProject will (i) provide reliable, sufficient, and less costly power \nsupply  to  Sihanoukville  and  Kampot  provinces,  including  rural \nareas along the transmission line corridor; (ii) reduce tariffs for \nconsumers;  (iii)  reduce  distribution  losses;  and  (iv)  make  the \ncommercial  and  industrial  sectors  more  competitive.  The  bulk \nsupply distribution component will provide reliable medium- and \nlow-voltage supplies to rural villages along the transmission line. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will (i) extend the 230 kV power grid from Kampot to \nSihanoukville  and  provide  reliable  supply  of  electricity  at \naffordable  prices  to  consumers  in  Sihanoukville  and  adjacent \nareas along the transmission corridor, (ii) increase connections, \n(iii) stimulate economic growth in the southern economic corridor, \nand (iv) improve EDC\u2019s operational efficiency and performance \nthrough institutional development and capacity building. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $52.36 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $8.36 million.  \n  ($ million) \nFinancing Plan       \nSource  Total  %  \nADB Loan (Special Fund)  20.00  38.0 \nJBIC Loan  22.30  43.0 \nGovernment Funds  10.06  19.0 \nTotal  52.36  100.0 \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \n  ADB will provide a loan of $20.00 million from its Special Fund \nresources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% during principal amortization, and other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Borrower will onlend the entire proceeds of the loan to the \nTerms  Executing Agency for a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace \nperiod, at an interest rate of 4.2%. The Executing Agency will bear \nthe exchange risk on the onlent amount.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "  iii\nImplementation  EDC will set up a project management unit to manage the Project. \nArrangements  During  project  implementation,  a  team  of  international  and \nnational consultants will help prepare the detailed project design \nand bid documents, evaluate bids, and implement and supervise \nthe  Project.  Project  engineering  and  construction  will  be \ncontracted out, and the contracts will be administered by EDC.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed from the proposed ADB loan will be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). The \nmajor works for the ADB-financed portion of the Project will be \n(i) a turnkey contract for the civil works for three substations, and \n(ii) the improvement of the EDC information system.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  will  be  required  during  implementation  to \nassist EDC in (i) preparing preliminary designs and bid documents \nfor the bidding of the works; (ii) evaluating bids; (iii) supervising \ninstallation  and  construction;  (iv)  carrying  out  final  testing  and \ncommissioning;  (v)  performing  quality  assurance; \n(vi)   implementing  the  environmental  management  plan,  the \nresettlement  plan,  and  the  land  acquisition  and  compensation \nprogram; and (vii) monitoring and evaluating the performance of \nthe  Project.  About  40  person-months  of  international  and  45 \nperson-months of national consultant inputs will be required. EDC \nwill recruit the consultants through a firm, according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006)  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and hiring of \nnational consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Adequate and reliable supply of power to industry and commercial \nBeneficiaries  consumers  will  enable  the  sustainable  development  of  these \nsectors and promote socioeconomic development in the southern \nregion. The project benefits will be increased revenues to the \nGovernment  and  EDC  and  reduced  costs  to  consumers, \nparticularly  those  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  using \nprivate generation facilities without the Project. In addition, rural \nhouseholds along the transmission line corridor will have access \nto electricity for the first time. The provision of firm capacity supply \nwill  allow  the  diesel  generators  to  be  decommissioned,  thus \nreducing air pollution. The Project\u2019s net present value of economic \nbenefits is estimated at $17.4 million. The economic internal rate \nof return will be a high 20.9%. \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  project \ndepends largely on the load demand in the region. The key risks \nare (i) lower-than-expected demand for electricity, (ii) insufficient \nelectricity supply from Viet Nam, (iii) delay in the creation of export \nprocessing  zone  in  Sihanoukville,  and  (iv)  high  tariff  and \nconnection  charges,  discouraging  large-scale  consumers  from \nswitching from their own generation sources to EDC\u2019s grid supply. \nEconomic growth has been strong and is envisaged to continue, \nresulting in an increased demand for electricity. Viet Nam\u2019s power \ndemand is also increasing but the Government is committed in \nhonoring the power purchase agreement it signed with Cambodia. \nViet Nam is an active member of the GMS Regional Power Trade \nCoordinating Committee and supports this power interconnection. \nBy importing lower-priced electricity from Viet Nam, the Project \nwill allow EDC to keep tariffs low to ensure connections by large-\nscale  industrial  consumers.  In  addition,  the  Government  will \nreview tariffs to ensure that proper tariffs and connection charges \nthat reflect best international practices are set. \n \nEDC\u2019s weak financial performance is a potential risk. Concrete \nand  achievable  financial  indicators  have  been  developed  and \nagreed on with the Government. These will be closely monitored \nduring project implementation. \n \nCompensation,  resettlement,  and  income-restoration  measures \nmight  not  be  delivered  as  agreed,  thereby  impoverishing  the \naffected people and delaying the start of civil works. EDC will hire \ninternational and national resettlement specialists to assist in the \npreparation and implementation of resettlement plans. The Project \nwill ensure that the impact of resettlement is further minimized by \ncarefully locating the towers during detailed design. EDC will hire \nan independent organization to monitor the resettlement activities \nthroughout. \n   \n ", " \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Cambodia has a small population of about 13 million, of which about one third live in \npoverty. The country\u2019s infrastructure was largely destroyed during decades of civil war and \nconflict, and its socioeconomic indicators are relatively lower than elsewhere in the region. \nSince peace and stability has been achieved only in the last few years, the Government of \nCambodia (the Government) is taking measures to further improve its economic base and \nstimulate economic growth. But to achieve this, Cambodia must improve its basic infrastructure. \n3.  The power sector in Cambodia is both small and highly fragmented, with 24 isolated \npower systems covering various provincial cities and the capital, Phnom Penh. About 85% of \nthe population lives in the rural areas and most have no access to electricity. Nationwide, less \nthan 17% of the population has access to electricity supply. Electricity consumption per capita is \nestimated at 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2004, one of the lowest in the region.1 In addition, the \nlack of an integrated high-voltage transmission system, the absence of interconnections with \nneighboring countries, and the high cost of imported diesel fuel have raised electricity prices in \nCambodia  to  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world  after  Japan.2 Since  Cambodia  has  limited \nindigenous energy sources,3 it relies primarily on imported diesel, which is expensive for power \ngeneration. The lack of adequate and affordable electricity supply is a main constraint on \neconomic  growth.  Given  the  importance  of  electricity  in  stimulating  economic  growth,  this \nconstraint, if not removed, will significantly limit growth and hinder the country\u2019s ability to attract \ninvestments that would stimulate economic activities, create employment, and reduce poverty. \n4.  Cambodia has begun to rehabilitate its infrastructure with support from development \npartners. Power demand has increased significantly, at 12% per year on average from 2000 to \n2005. Increasing access to electricity, especially in provincial and rural areas, is essential to \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment gives priority to establishing a national power grid and expanding it to unserved \nareas. \n5.  The Government has requested the Asian Development  Bank (ADB) to assist it in \nexpanding  its  power  transmission  network  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country,  including \nconstructing  a  new  high-voltage  230  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  linking  Cambodia  and \nViet Nam  to  allow  Cambodia  to  import  reliable  low-cost  power.  ADB  approved  a  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)4 in January 2003. The first component of this TA entailed \na feasibility study of a 230 kV transmission line from the Vietnamese border to Takeo and \n                                                 \n1  In comparison, that same year the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic consumed 206 KWh per capita, Viet Nam \n550 kWh, and Thailand 1,890 kWh. \n2  Commercial and industrial users are now charged $0.21/kWh, and residential users $0.10/kWh. In comparison, the \naverage retail tariffs in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam are around $0.04/kWh, \n$0.07/ kWh, and $0.06/ kWh, respectively. \n3  Offshore findings of oil and gas have been reported but these will be confirmed in 2007, when ongoing drillings are \ncompleted and the results evaluated. \n4  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Power Distribution and Greater Mekong \nSubregion Transmission Project. Manila (TA 4078-CAM). ", "2 \nPhnom Penh. An ADB loan for the Greater Mekong Subregion Transmission Project5 was \napproved  in  December  2003.  The  project  is  now  being  implemented  and  the  230  kV \ntransmission line is expected to be commissioned in early 2008. The second component of the \nTA was a feasibility study of the construction of a 230 kV6 transmission line from Kampot to \nSihanoukville  and  the  associated  distribution  system.  The  TA\u2019s  findings  led  to  a  visit  to \nCambodia by an ADB fact-finding mission from 22 November to 1 December 2005. This report \nis based on the agreements reached with the Government during the mission. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the proposed project is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategies \n6.  The Government has drawn up policies to accelerate pro-poor economic growth in \nconjunction with its socioeconomic development plans. In 2004, the Government put together its \nRectangular  Strategy,  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  guide  the  country\u2019s  development  with \nemphasis on agriculture, the private sector, infrastructure, and capacity building. Acknowledging \nthe importance of the power sector in the overall development of the country, the Government \nmade the establishment of a reliable power supply and transmission grid a top priority in the \nstrategy. \n7.  The  Government\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy7 aims  to  provide  adequate, \nreliable, and stable power supply at affordable prices throughout the country. The key policy \nframework  consists  of  (i)  intensifying  investments  in  power  generation  and  transmission, \n(ii) connecting Cambodia\u2019s transmission lines to the power grids in neighboring countries to \nallow Cambodia to import lower-cost electricity and possibly engage in power trading in the \nfuture,  (iii)  establishing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  (iv)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation, and (v) expanding provincial and rural electrification. The Government is also \ncommitted to providing reliable and affordable electricity service to 90% of villages and 70% of \nrural households by 2030. To meet the growing demand for electricity, the Government is \ndeveloping a nationwide high-voltage transmission system as a backbone to give provincial \ncenters  access  to  electricity  from  efficient,  large-scale  power  stations,  and  other  low-cost \nsources of imported power. \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy8 \n8.  The  power  sector  plays  a  key  role  in  economic  growth  and  social  development  in \nCambodia. ADB\u2019s approach is to assist the Government in achieving its development objectives \nas  stated  in  the  Rectangular  Strategy  by  providing  continuing  support  for  power  sector \ndevelopment. ADB\u2019s development assistance strategy is to focus on (i) expanding the country\u2019s \nbackbone power transmission and distribution systems to unserved areas and providing reliable \nand affordable power supply to consumers, (ii) improving sector performance and operational \nefficiency through institutional strengthening and capacity building, (iii) promoting tariff reform \nand adopting sound development strategies and policies to maintain sustainable and efficient \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

Such an integrated approach will reinforce investment \nprojects, thereby maximizing efforts and lowering costs through economies of scale. Thus far, \nADB has provided four loans totaling about $110 million to finance power sector projects in \nCambodia. These loans are the Special Rehabilitation Assistance in 1992, Power Rehabilitation \nProject in 1994, Provincial Power Supply Project in 2000, and GMS Transmission Project in \n2003 (refer to para. 17 and Appendix 2). \n3.  Power Sector Performance and Development Strategies \n9.  The provision of power is the responsibility of Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodia (EDC), under the \noverall supervision of the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME). MIME is responsible \nfor formulating and implementing policies, strategies, and plans, and for setting guidelines and \nstandards. EDC owns and operates small power-generating plants that are fueled by expensive \nlight diesel and heavy fuel oil. EDC also purchases more than 50% of the power it distributes to \nits customers in Phnom Penh and 13 provincial towns from independent power producers (IPPs) \nat costs that range from $0.11/kWh to $0.17/kWh.  \n10.  Sihanoukville is Cambodia\u2019s only deep-sea port and is growing fast. There are major \nongoing development projects to (i) expand the existing port infrastructure facilities to handle the \nincrease in container traffic, (ii) establish an export-processing zone with backward linkages that \nwould  increase  employment,  and  (iii)  upgrade  and  expand  the  domestic  airport  to  handle \ninternational flights and attract tourists to Sihanoukville\u2019s beaches. Sihanoukville is also a part of \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Southern Economic Corridor Project, one of the three \ncore projects of the GMS economic cooperation program.9 \n11.  Power supply in Sihanoukville is now based on diesel generators that provide about \n20 gigawatt-hours (GWh) with a peak demand of 5 megawatts (MW) for 8,000 consumers (as of \n2004). The coverage of the distribution system is limited to the town, beach resorts, and port \nareas, and some villages along National Road 4. In 1998, ADB assisted EDC in installing a 5 \nMW  diesel  generator  in  Sihanoukville  and  upgrading  the  distribution  system.10 However, \nbecause  of  the  high  growth  in  power  demand,  the  power  system  is  once  again  severely \nconstrained and unable to meet the demand. EDC needs to purchase another 5 MW of power \nfrom IPPs or add another 5 MW of generating capacity to meet the growing demand of its \npresent customers. Electricity consumers, particularly commercial and industrial consumers, \nface the problem of high electricity tariffs. Rather than connecting to the power grid, many major \nconsumers choose to generate their own electricity as they can ensure reliability of supply and it \nis  cheaper  to  generate.  Self-generation  cost  is  around  $0.14/kWh  including  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. The present captive energy demand11 in Sihanoukville is estimated to be \nmore than 20 GWh. \n12.  To ensure reliable electricity supply to meet the growing demand and sustain economic \ngrowth, EDC needs to import additional power at lower cost from neighboring countries. ADB, \n                                                 \n9  An economic corridor is a geographic area in which infrastructure is linked directly with trade, investment, and \nproduction  opportunities.  Three  economic  corridors\u2014north\u2013south,  east\u2013west,  and  southern\u2014are  being \nimplemented as the flagship programs of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) with the endorsement of the GMS \ncountry leaders. The GMS countries are Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, \n10 ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Power Rehabilitation Project. Manila (Loan 1345-CAM[SF]). \n11 Captive demand refers to the energy consumption by those consumers that currently supply their own needs with \ndiesel generators or have access to private power supply from diesel generators. These consumers will shift to the \nEDC power grid once it is available. \n ", "4 \ntogether with other development partners, is assisting EDC in importing reliable and cheaper \npower from Viet Nam through the construction of a 230 kV high-voltage bulk transmission line, \nwhich is scheduled for commissioning in 2008 (footnote 4). The transmission line comes from a \nsubstation at the Vietnamese border through Takeo to Phnom Penh. It will evacuate a total \ncapacity of 200 MW at tariffs lower than the generating cost in Phnom Penh.12 In parallel, a \n230 kV transmission line from Takeo to Kampot will be built under a grant funded by German \ndevelopment cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW).13 This transmission line \nwill also be commissioned in 2008. This interconnection will relieve the strain on the country\u2019s \ngeneration capacity and also stimulate economic growth in the southern provinces of Takeo, \nKampot, and Sihanoukville. \n13.  The proposed project will directly complement previous investments in transmission and \ndistribution facilities. It will extend the 230 kV transmission line from Kampot to Sihanoukville, \nthus providing efficient and economical means to electrify those areas. The Project is identified \nas a priority project in the Government\u2019s current investment plan (2005\u20132020) (footnote 7). The \npower sector is analyzed in detail in Appendix 3. \n4.  Rural Electrification and Private Sector Participation \n14.  The provision of electricity to rural areas has been recognized as a key to reducing \npoverty in rural areas. With help from the World Bank, the Government has established the \nRural Electrification and Renewable Energy Fund, which will promote private sector participation \nin rural electrification and renewable energy development. \n15.  EDC has developed a rural electrification program, which consists of grid extension in \nthe outlying areas of major provincial towns, including Sihanoukville and Kampot, with the aim of \nachieving about 13,000 new connections in these two areas. The Project will assist EDC in \nproviding electricity supply to these rural areas. This will be done on a least-cost basis, using \nconventional 22 kV feeders for villages in the vicinity of the provincial towns. \n16.  Rural  electricity  enterprises  (REEs)  provide  electricity  services  in  small  towns  and \nvillages. These private entrepreneurs supply power to a few hundred local residents and small \ncommercial establishments. However, they supply power to end users at a cost that far exceeds \nEDC\u2019s, and for only 4 to 6 hours a day. Supplying bulk electricity power to REEs to enable them \nto supply the rural areas is the most realistic business model in the absence of a transmission \ngrid. In addition, EDC does not have the capability or the resources to provide electricity to such \nareas with low customer density. Furthermore, there are about 600 existing REEs that could \npurchase electricity at the transformer terminal and distribute it to their customers. The Project \nwill therefore assist REEs in expanding their business and connecting more rural customers by \nbuilding distribution facilities.  \n                                                 \n12 A power purchase agreement between EDC and Electricity of Viet Nam was signed in 2004. Tariffs agreed with \nViet Nam range from $0.05/kWh to $0.07/kWh for off-peak and peak periods. EDC will sell the purchased power to \nthe grid at $0. 08/kWh, which is lower than the cost of captive power generation. \n13 The financing and project agreement between KfW and the Government was signed in September 2005. The \nproject is being implemented as scheduled. \n ", "5 \n5.  Lessons \n17.  Of the four ADB-financed projects, two projects have been completed,14 while two others \nare  still  being  implemented.15 The  experience  from  these  projects  shows  EDC\u2019s  strong \ncommitment and generally satisfactory technical capabilities in implementing power projects. \nBut EDC\u2019s institutional capacity to deal with resettlement and environmental management is \nweak,  and  poor  implementation  has  delayed  resettlement.  In  addition,  deficiencies  in \nresettlement implementation have not been brought to light because of inadequate monitoring. \nEDC needs better institutional arrangements and more capacity building in resettlement and \nenvironmental management. ADB has provided technical assistance under Loan 2052 for social \nand environmental management, and will continue to do so for this proposed project. EDC is \nstrengthening its Environment and Social Unit. The Inter-Ministerial Resettlement Committee \n(IRC)  is  also  improving  its  resettlement  management  capacity.  ADB  is  providing  separate \ntechnical  assistance  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement  legal  framework  and \ninstitutional arrangements and its capacity for involuntary resettlement.16 \n18.  The  completed  projects  also  highlighted  the  need  to  (i)  continuously  improve  the \ncapacity  of  EDC  in  project  processing  and  implementation,  (ii)  increase  efficiency  and \ntransparency in budget utilization, (iii) formulate and implement anticorruption measures, and \n(iv) involve local communities and stakeholders in the identification and prioritization of project \nactivities  for  resettlement  and  environmental  management.  These  lessons  have  been \nincorporated into the proposed project. The Project will further strengthen the operation and \nmaintenance capacity of EDC\u2019s provincial branches. A procurement committee consisting of \nrepresentatives from government agencies concerned will be formed to ensure that all project-\nrelated activities, including anticorruption measures, are being carried out as planned (paras. \n46\u201347). \n6.  Policy Dialogue \n19.  While the Project will assist EDC in expanding and reinforcing its transmission and \ndistribution facilities, it will also continue the policy dialogue with the energy sector to expedite \npolicy formulation and institutional reform in  (i) formulating and adopting a comprehensive \nenergy sector strategy and implementation plan that is costed, (ii) improving EDC\u2019s financial and \noperational  efficiency  (paras.  23\u201327),  and  (iii)  carrying  out  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building (para. 33). \n20.  Energy sector development is constrained by a number of related factors including lack \nof  sound  sector  policy  and  legal  framework,  limited  access  to  the  capital  market  for \nimprovements  in  system  operations,  high  generation  costs  resulting  in  high  tariffs,  and \nunreliable power supply. The Government recognizes that it must develop a strategic framework \nto  govern  the  systematic  development  of  the  energy  sector  in  Cambodia  and  lead  to  the \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1992.

With  assistance  from  its  development \npartners, the Government is carrying out a major exercise\u2014the Energy Sector Strategy Review \n(ESSR)17 programmed over a 3-year period from 2005 to 2007. The stakeholders have agreed \nthat  a  government-owned  sector  development  strategy  with  the  funding  agencies\u2019  full \nparticipation would be the basis for a sector-wide approach to future assistance. The ESSR will \nassess the performance of the sector, diagnose key deficiencies, and develop appropriate \nstrategies and implementation plans within legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks, and \nprioritized investment programs. \n21.  EDC has not complied satisfactorily with financial covenants under previous loans. By \nthe end of 2005, it was able to meet only the debt-equity ratio covenant, and to reduce its \ntransmission and distribution losses. But it has not complied with the debt service coverage ratio \n(DSCR), accounts receivable from government agencies, and revenue breakeven covenants. \n22.  EDC\u2019s  poor  financial  performance  is  due  to  (i)  steep  increases  in  fuel  oil  price, \n(ii) depreciation of the local currency, (iii) high price of power purchases from IPPs in the late \n1990s, (iv) small (uneconomical) size of diesel generation plants, and (v) high level of duties \nand  taxes  levied  by  the  Government  on  imported  fuel  and  spare  parts.  EDC\u2019s  financial \nperformance  is  also  affected  by  late  electricity  payments  by  some  line  ministries  due  to \ninsufficient budget or improper use of budget allocation for other purposes. These problems \nhave been further compounded by the lack of timely action from the Government to address the \nproblems, to refund the value-added taxes to EDC, and to introduce automatic tariff adjustments \nto cover oil price increases and foreign exchange fluctuations that would permit EDC to meet its \nannual revenue requirements. \n23.  While EDC has made considerable progress in its operations in the last decade, a \nnumber of financial issues still need to be addressed. The Government, recognizing EDC\u2019s \nfinancial situation, took action in 2005 to increase EDC\u2019s tariff in Phnom Penh and Kandal \nprovince. Effective 1 July 2005, the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) revised the tariff \ncategory  of  major  consumers  in  these  two  service  areas  of  EDC  to  rationalize  tariffs  by \n(i) introducing an automatic foreign exchange adjustment to the cost of EDC's power purchases, \n(ii) having one tariff level for both industrial and commercial (small and medium) consumers, \n(iii) rationalizing the lifeline tariffs, and (iv) applying one tariff rate for the entire consumption of \nresidential consumers. A second action on electricity tariffs taken by the Government to further \nimprove  the  financial  position  of  EDC  increased  the  lifeline  tariff  and  applied  automatic \nadjustments for all industrial and commercial consumers not only in Phnom Penh but also in \nKandal and Kampong Speu provinces. The new power tariffs, which also raised the average \ntariffs by 11%, took effect on 1 November 2005.  \n24.  The Government has increased the budget allocation for electricity payments and settled \npart of the past-due arrears. The total government arrears were reduced from KR47 billion in \n2004 to KR28.8 billion by December 2005, representing about 3 weeks of electricity sales. The \nGovernment has helped EDC maintain a satisfactory debt-to-equity ratio by converting debt of \naround $60 million to equity. The debt-to-equity ratio improved from 58:42 in 1999 to 48:52 in \n                                                 \n17 The Energy Sector Strategy Review is a major policy review exercise programmed from 2005 to 2007, to create a \nstrategic framework that would govern the systematic development of the energy sector in Cambodia. The exercise \nwill be participatory, with the Government taking the lead and funding agencies including ADB, Department for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, JBIC, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nand the World Bank contributing. Major outputs include an update of the power development master plan, studies \non renewable energy strategy and power sector efficiency, a review of infrastructure, a hydropower master plan, a \nrural electrification master plan, a regulatory framework for the oil and gas industry, and an energy sector strategy \nand implementation plan. \n ", "7 \n2005. If total tariff increases are taken into account, EDC\u2019s financial performance has improved \nand should achieve breakeven in revenue terms by 2007. \n25.  The Government is also committed to taking further measures including (i) renegotiating \nand purchasing more electricity through competitive bidding from various IPPs and importing \nlower-cost  electricity  from  neighboring  countries,  (ii)  settling  past  arrears  of  line  ministries \nthrough  budget  allocation,  and  (iii)  continuously  reducing  EDC\u2019s  system  losses.  The \nGovernment has prepared a time-bound action plan, outlining concrete steps to fully reimburse \nEDC for the past arrears of line ministries as of the end of 2005 and for VAT (para. 74\u201375). \nDetails of EDC\u2019s financial performance and projections are given in Appendix 4. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The Project will (i) directly expand the 230 kV power transmission grid from Kampot to \nSihanoukville  to  provide  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  supply  at  affordable  prices  to \nconsumers in Sihanoukville and adjacent areas along the transmission corridor, and (ii) improve \nEDC\u2019s operational efficiency and performance through institutional development and capacity \nbuilding. \n27.  The  first  outcome  will  be  achieved  by  facilitating  the  importation  of  electricity  from \nViet Nam  through  the  project  transmission  lines,  thus  providing  sustainable  and  reliable \nelectricity supply at a lower cost than any alternative, and improving EDC\u2019s financial position. \nCurrently, the EDC tariff in Sihanoukville ranges from $0.13 to $0.20 per kWh. In rural towns, \nREEs supply electricity at tariffs as high as $0.38\u2013$0.63/kWh. Through the Project, electricity \nfrom Viet Nam will have a delivered electricity price in Sihanoukville of around $0.08/kWh, \nincluding losses, operation and maintenance, and all taxes. This will greatly ease the burden of \nconsumers by enabling them to use the savings for other purposes (education, health, or \nbusiness), and promote sustainable economic development. Rural villages and communities \nclose to the transmission line that are currently not served will also be supplied with electricity.  \n28.  The Project will also assist the Government in four key areas: (i) reducing electricity cost \nand formulating sound tariff policies, (ii) enhancing EDC\u2019s financial performance, (iii) reducing \ndistribution losses, and (iv) improving the efficiency of EDC\u2019s operations. \nB.  Outputs \n29.  The  Project  has  two  major  components.  Part  A  will  focus  on  the  infrastructure \ncomponents,  while  part  B  will  entail  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building.  The \nProject\u2019s infrastructure components were developed following technical, economic, and financial \nstudies that took environmental and social aspects into consideration. The feasibility study \n(footnote 4) considered various alternatives for power supply to Sihanoukville and involved a \nleast-cost analysis, including comparisons of power supply from diesel generation, transmission \nline, generators, etc. The study concluded that developing a double-circuit 230 kV transmission \nline and associated distribution facilities was the most cost-effective option for the supply of \nelectricity in the target areas. \n30.  Part A comprises five subcomponents:  \n(i)  Extension of 230 kV transmission line. The high-voltage 230 kV double-circuit \ntransmission lines will be extended from Kampot to Sihanoukville, for a total \nlength of about 78 kilometers (km). \n ", "8 \n(ii)  Construction of substations. A new 230 kV grid substation at Veal Renh, a 230 \nkV/22 kV substation in Sihanoukville, and a 230 kV line bay at Kampot substation \nwill be built. \n(iii)  Construction of medium- and low-voltage distribution system. The Project \nwill put up conventional medium-voltage 22 kV double-circuit distribution lines in \nSihanoukville connecting to the 230 kV substation and the existing 22 kV network, \nand 22 kV feeders from Sihanoukville and Veal Renh substations serving nearby \nvillages. To serve the villages along the transmission line corridor, 22 kV and \n400 V distribution lines will also be erected. \n(iv)  Consulting services to assist EDC in detailed project design, implementation \nsupervision, and other capacity-building support. \n(v)  Project  management  and  monitoring  activities,  including  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  environmental  mitigation,  monitoring,  training  for  EDC  staff  in \nenvironmental management, and resettlement implementation. \n31.  In part B, the operating efficiency and performance of EDC will be improved. Part B will \nhave the following four subcomponents: \n(i)  Strengthening  of  EDC\u2019s  provincial  operations.  With  the  extension  of  the \npower grid, EDC\u2019s operation and maintenance capacity in Sihanoukville and \nKampot provinces will also need to be strengthened. The provincial branches \nnow operate the diesel generators, maintain the distribution system, and collect \nthe  electricity  charge.  When  outages  occur,  EDC  sends  technical  staff  from \nheadquarters for system recovery. The Project will strengthen the EDC branches \nin Sihanoukville and Kampot by providing the necessary vehicles and equipment \nto detect outage points, thus speeding up system recovery and reducing its cost. \n(ii)  Training in operation and maintenance of the high-voltage transmission \nsystem. Considering the number of staff required to operate the high-voltage \ntransmission system to be developed in the coming decade, EDC staff will need \ncontinuous and increasingly more advanced training. \n(iii)  Improvement of EDC\u2019s data management system. EDC\u2019s critical statistical \ndata  are  now  scattered  in  its  headquarters  and  branch  offices,  hampering \ncentralized activities such as backup, reporting, processing, and management. \nThe  Project  will  support  EDC  in  establishing  a  consolidated  data  platform \nincluding  reliable  backup  systems  and  improved  communication  systems \nbetween headquarters and branches, by procuring the necessary hardware and \nsoftware. EDC can thus efficiently maintain electronic information and improve \ncustomer billing, archiving, and services. 18 \n(iv)  Training  of  EDC  staff  in  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental \nmanagement.  EDC  is  striving  to  strengthen  its  capacity  by  recruiting  more \nqualified staff and providing on-the-job training. The Project will finance higher-\nlevel education for two social and environmental specialists from existing EDC \nstaff at appropriate agencies in ASEAN countries. \n \n                                                 \n18 This component is an incremental step with a budget of $500,000 and will supplement EDC\u2019s existing programs to \ncentralize and archive customer and billing records. The proposed work involves installing and commissioning the \nstorage and data management system and its tape backup system including hardware and software installation, \ntraining, and other customer support services. \n ", "9 \nC.  Special Features \n32.  The Project has a regional cooperation focus. It forms part of the planned transmission \nbackbone grid: the transmission lines between Cambodia and Viet Nam will be connected to the \ngrid. Through the Project, EDC will be able to provide the southern provinces with reliable and \naffordable electricity from the lowest-cost source of power. The Project will increase importation \nof power from Viet Nam by around 50 MW by 2015 and will thus benefit both Viet Nam and \nCambodia. The Project will also contribute to the economic development of the GMS Southern \nEconomic  Corridor,  a  flagship  program  of  GMS  economic  cooperation,  by  providing  basic \neconomic infrastructure. \n33.  The provision of firm and reliable supply of electricity to Sihanoukville would allow the \ndecommissioning of the low-efficiency and high-cost diesel generating plants (around 5 MW). \nLarge consumers, who now run their own small, low-efficiency diesel generators (estimated at \n10 MW), will connect to the EDC power grid when cheap and reliable power becomes available. \nThus, EDC, the private sector, and the country as a whole will spend less foreign exchange on \nfuel imports and also benefit from reduced environmental pollution. \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n34.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $52.36 million equivalent. The cost estimates \nare based on 2005 price levels for base costs. Physical contingencies were estimated at 10% of \nbase costs, and price contingencies were calculated using ADB\u2019s current rates of inflation for \nlocal and foreign goods and services. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and set out \nin detail in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C. \nE.  Financing Plan \n35.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  for  a  loan  of  $20  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help finance the Project. The ADB loan will finance 38% of total project \ncosts. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% during principal amortization, and such other terms and \nconditions as are set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n36.  The  Government  of  Japan  supports  the  construction  of  transmission  lines  and  the \nexpansion of substations to promote stable electric supply through the importation of electricity \nfrom neighboring countries. In this context, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is \ninterested  in  supporting  the  southern  economic  growth  corridor,  which  lies  between \nKampong Cham, Phnom Penh, and Sihanoukville. JBIC will provide parallel cofinancing for a \nJapanese yen loan of about $22.3 million equivalent for the transmission and distribution line \npackages and part of the capacity-building activities, representing 43% of total project cost. The \nGovernment will fund $10.06 million of local project costs, representing 19% of total project \ncosts. If cofinancing does not materialize, the scope of the Project may have to be reconsidered. \nThe financing plan based on these initial assumptions is presented in Table 2. \n \n ", "10 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Total  \nItem  Cost \n     \nA.

The borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the entire proceeds of the loan will \nbe relent to EDC through a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will relend the ADB loan to EDC for a loan of 20-\nyear maturity, including a 5-year grace period, at an interest rate of 4.2%, and will relend the \nJBIC loan on the same terms. EDC will bear the Government\u2019s foreign exchange risk on the \nproposed loan. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be EDC. EDC has implemented two \nADB-funded projects in the power sector, and is implementing two other projects (footnote 15), \nin the process demonstrating that it has adequate capacity to implement similar projects. The \nProject will be implemented by a project management unit. To ensure continuous improvement \nof EDC\u2019s project management capacity, the project management unit will consist of EDC staff \nthat  have  been  part  of  previous  ADB-financed  transmission  line  projects.  During  project \nimplementation, EDC will also be assisted by a team of international and national consultants. \nEDC will assign at least three experienced and qualified engineers full-time to coordinate and \nwork with the consultants. EDC will also appoint two recent graduates in environment and social \nscience to its Environment and Resettlement Unit to gain experience through on-the-job training. \nThe consultants and the seconded EDC staff will ensure that the Project is executed on time \nand according to international standards. \n2.  Implementation Period \n39.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, from the first quarter of FY2007. The \nphysical works are expected to be completed by the end of 2009. After that, the contractor will \ntrain EDC staff for 6 months to operate and maintain the transmission lines. The implementation \nschedule is shown in Appendix 6. \n40.  Resettlement work will begin shortly after the appointment of the project implementation \nconsultants (PICs) and independent monitoring organization and after detailed design, with \nfieldwork for the detailed measurement survey to confirm the number of affected households \nand the nature and magnitude of impacts, determine compensation rates at replacement cost \nfor all categories of loss, and update and disclose the agreed resettlement plan (RP) for the \ntransmission component. After the detailed design of the distribution component, resettlement \nplanning will be undertaken and an RP will be prepared according to the agreed resettlement \n ", "12 \nframework (RF). The updated RP for the transmission component and the RP for the distribution \nsystem will be agreed on between the Government and ADB, disclosed according to ADB\u2019s \npublic communications policy, 19 and implemented satisfactorily according to ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement.20 \n3.  Procurement \n41.  Goods and services financed from the proposed ADB loan will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006), and those financed by JBIC will be procured according \nto JBIC guidelines. The contracts for the 230 kV substation package will be awarded on a \nturnkey  basis  through  international  competitive  bidding, using  a  single-stage,  two-envelope \nprocedure. To expedite project implementation, ADB has approved advance procurement action \nfor the ADB-financed components. The Government has been advised that approval of advance \naction for procurement will not commit ADB to subsequently finance the Project. A procurement \nplan,  which  sets  forth  the  proposed  contracts,  method  of  procurement,  and  related  ADB \nprocedures, is shown in Appendix 7. \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  PICs  will  be  required  during  implementation  to  assist  EDC  in  project  engineering, \nprocurement,  supervision  of  installation  and  construction,  final  testing  and  commissioning, \nquality assurance, design and implementation of environmental management and resettlement \nplans, and other technical inputs. About 40 person-months of international consulting services \nand  about  45  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  project \nsupervision. The terms of reference for the PICs are given in Appendix 8. \n43.  PICs will be recruited through a firm by EDC, according to the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers (2006). A quality- and cost-based \nselection procedure will be used. The Government has been advised that approval of advance \naction for consulting services does not commit ADB to subsequently finance the Project.  \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand EDC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n45.  Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for \nbidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the \nprocurement and execution of contracts, and the sanctions imposed on those who violate these \nstandards. Government  policy  and  experience  in  fighting  corruption  dictate  the  use  of  the \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "13 \nfollowing preventive measures: (i) a procurement committee will be formed to supervise the \nentire  procurement  process,  according  to  the  guidelines  prescribed  in  the  Government-\napproved Procurement Manual; and (ii) the Government will also cause EDC to initiate liaison \nmeetings every 6 months with the National Auditor Office to review and discuss information on \ncorrupt practices. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  ADB funds under the proposed project will be disbursed mainly for the construction of \nsubstations and for PIC services. ADB\u2019s loan disbursement procedures stated in the Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001), as amended from time to time, will be followed. An imprest \naccount will be used for local expenditures. At the start, the account will hold the amount of \nestimated local expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, but no more than \n10%  of  the  loan  amount  (i.e.,  $2.0  million).  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated under the statement-of-expenditures procedure should not exceed $100,000. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n47.  Progress reports for the Project will be prepared by EDC and submitted to ADB every \nquarter.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  the  physical  progress,  procurement  and \ncontractual status, resettlement progress, and highlights of any implementation issues including \nthe number of consumers connected. The progress reports will also contain a summary of \nproject  components,  including  details  on  the  latest  project  disbursements  for  incremental \nexpenditures and contract amounts. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB and \nJBIC within 3 months after the completion of the Project. \n48.  EDC will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within 6 months of the close of \nEDC\u2019s fiscal year (31 December), EDC will submit audited annual project accounts (APA) to \nADB, describing in detail the sources of funds and the expenditures made. In addition, EDC will \nsubmit audited corporate financial statements (CFS) within 6 months of the close of the fiscal \nyear, including statements of income and expenditures, assets and liabilities with notes to the \naccounts, and cash flows. An auditor acceptable to ADB must audit EDC\u2019s CFS and APA, and \nthe audit report together with the memorandum on issues identified during the audit process will \nalso be attached to the respective reports (see details in Supplementary Appendix D: Financial \nManagement Assessment of EDC). \n49.  According to current practice, EDC will continue to hire external auditors to audit its \ncorporate  financial  statements  and  all  separate  project  accounts  including  resettlement \nexpenditures.  International  accounting  standards  will  be  followed  in  the  preparation  of  the \naccounts, and International Auditing Standards in the performance of the audit. The auditors will \nbe required to provide an opinion on EDC\u2019s compliance with the Project\u2019s financial covenants \nand indicate the details of the actual calculations for all ratios as defined in the Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  A number of measurable performance targets will be selected during the implementation \nstage, according to ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring and evaluation system. The number \nof  electricity  customers  and  demand  in  various  categories  will  be  monitored  using  EDC\u2019s \nconsumer database, with a separate category for poor consumers (i.e., those consuming up to \n50 kWh of electricity a month). Efficiencies in utility operations will be measured by data on \n ", "14 \ndistribution losses, energy sales, employee-customer ratio, and average cost of service. The \ndegree of compliance with financial covenants will provide an indication of EDC\u2019s financial \nperformance  throughout  the  implementation  period.  The  monitoring  of  EDC\u2019s  Sihanoukville \nbranch  will  include  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  demand  management  and \nconsumer services component of the Project. Within the first year of connections, a baseline \nsurvey will be carried out by EDC to monitor connection rates of householders, electricity \nexpenditures, and other relevant indicators. Two years after the baseline survey, an impact \nsurvey will be carried out by EDC to monitor the Project\u2019s sustainability and development impact. \n9.  Project Review \n51.  ADB will review the Project regularly throughout its implementation. In addition, the \nGovernment, ADB, and JBIC will also jointly undertake a detailed midterm review of the Project \nafter 2 years of implementation. The midterm review will (i) appraise the project scope, cost \nestimates, implementation arrangements, number of connections, and compliance with loan \ncovenants;  and  (ii)  identify  any  issues  to  be  addressed  to  improve  project  impact  and \nsustainability. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n52.  The project benefits and impacts were assessed along with the potential associated \nrisks. Adequate and reliable supply of power to industry and commercial consumers will enable \nthe sustainable development of these sectors and promote the socioeconomic development of \nthe southern region. The project benefits are increased revenues to the Government and EDC \nand reduced costs to consumers, particularly the industrial and commercial consumers using \nprivate generation facilities without the Project. The provision of firm-capacity supply would \nallow existing diesel generators to be decommissioned, thus reducing greenhouse gas and \nother air-polluting emissions. The combined benefits and positive impacts outweigh the costs, \nand net benefits will accrue to the project area. \nA.  Economic Analysis \n53.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  follows  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. The evaluation is based on a comparison of benefits and costs with and \nwithout the Project. The least-cost analysis minimizes the present value of the southern grid \nexpansion cost between 2007 and 2035. All costs are expressed in world prices in constant \n2005 dollars and discounted over 30 years using a discount factor of 12%. The base case for \nthe analysis is the with-project construction of the transmission line between Sihanoukville and \nKampot in 2010. Without the transmission line project, the feasible least-cost alternative is to \nadd several diesel power plants in Sihanoukville to meet the increasing demand. The with-\nproject scenario would result in lower expansion costs than for the alternative without-project \nscenario. This shows that the Project is the least-cost option. \n54.  The financial capital costs are adjusted in the economic analysis to reflect the economic \ncost of project inputs. The capital costs are classified into tradable goods and services, and non-\ntradable goods and services. The non-tradable goods and services are converted to the world \nprice numeraire using a standard conversion factor. Costs for operating and maintaining the \ntransmission line are included in the analysis. The project benefits are the cost-savings in the \nsouthern transmission grid expansion between the with-project and the without-project scenario. \nThe calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 20.9 %. \n ", "15 \n55.  Sensitivity and risk analyses have been undertaken for key risk variables to examine the \nrobustness  of  the  economic  results.  The  result  shows  that  the  Project  is  economically \nworthwhile even under combined extreme adverse conditions (Appendix 9). \nB.  Financial Analysis \n56.  The financial benefits are essentially derived from the increase of electricity sales due to \nload growth, and from savings due to the lower price of energy purchased, and electricity loss \nreduction in the Project areas. A model was developed to forecast the trend in electricity \nconsumption for the following current customers of EDC: residential, commercial and hotels, \nindustries, and government agencies. The model also includes the forecast of captive demand \nof large hotels and industries that are currently generating energy for their own consumption. \n57.  A financial analysis of the Project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects. The following projections and \nassumptions were used: (i) the total system demand in the south is expected to reach 30 MW \nand 140 GWh in 2010 and 52 MW and 240 GWh in 2014, (ii) annual sales will grow 15% on \naverage from 2006 to 2013, and (iii) average tariff will increase from KR666 in 2006 to KR718 in \n2013. Given these assumptions for the benefit and cost analyses, the post-tax evaluation of the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project was estimated at 13.3% in real terms. The \ndetailed financial analysis is shown in Appendix 10. \n58.  Sensitivity analysis indicated that the Project was robust for a potential decrease in load \ngrowth, increase in construction cost, increase in price of power purchases, and 2 years\u2019 delay \nin completing the Project. Overall, the Project remains financially viable under the various \nranges of scenarios. \nC.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n59.  The Project is classified as environment category B\u2013sensitive. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been conducted. The IEE assessed the likely environmental impact of \nthe proposed project, the anticipated significance of such impact, and proposed mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring programs. Special attention was given to the assessment of the \nproject alignment, which may traverse the buffer zone of the Bokor National Park.21 The IEE \nprocess  also  included  extensive  public  consultations  with  stakeholders  from  the  local \ncommunities. The IEE concluded that the project will have insignificant environmental impact. \nThe IEE has been circulated to the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded onto the ADB Web \nsite in February 2006. \n60.  EDC is committed to providing adequate staff and budget resources to implement the \nenvironmental  management  plan,  which  was  prepared  for  the  IEE,  during  project \nimplementation  and  operation.  The  Government  will  ensure  special  care  and  adequate \ncoordination during the construction of the Project within or adjacent to the Bokor National \nPark\u2019s buffer zone, to minimize its impact on the park.  \n                                                 \n21 Around 20 km of the proposed transmission line route crosses the southern edge of the Bokor National Park buffer \nzone to avoid the greater net impact from the line that would result from crossing other sections of the coastal plain \nbetween  the  park  and  the  coastline.  The  main  impact  on  the  Park  will  be  the  loss  of  15  hectares  of \ndegraded/regrowth forest and the creation of modest visual impact. \n ", "16 \nD.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n61.  The social analysis undertaken as part of the feasibility study indicated the need for a \nshort RP for the 230 kV transmission line and for the Kampot and Sihanoukville substations \nbecause fewer than 200 persons will experience major impact.22 An RP has been prepared, \ntherefore, for the construction of the following: (i) the 78 km 230 kV double-circuit transmission \nline from Kampot to Sihanoukville, (ii) one 230 kV substation at Veal Renh, and (iii) one 230 kV \nsubstation at Sihanoukville. The 230 kV substation at Kampot will be extended within the \nexisting site, and will not entail any land acquisition. For the 230 kV transmission line and two \nsubstations, resettlement planning has identified 731 households that will be affected by land \nacquisition. Of these, it is anticipated that only 12 households would need to move out of the \n30 m right-of-way (ROW): 7 could move back on their remaining land outside the ROW, and 5 \nwould relocate within their own villages. Fourteen households would also have to relocate their \ntemporary field huts on their remaining land outside the ROW. Only two households would lose \nland to the two new substations. Of the rest of the 700 or so households, 220 would be \nmarginally affected by a loss of 100 m2 of land for the transmission line towers. A total of 3.92 \nhectares of land will be permanently acquired. It is also estimated that 3,000 trees would have \nto be removed to ensure sufficient vertical clearance for the 230 kV line. Except for land \nrequired for towers, the land within the ROW can continue to be used for agriculture. \n62.  Land acquisition may also be required for the 22 kV distribution system, but the location \nand  design  of  the  distribution  system  will  not  be  known  until  the  detailed  design  of  the \ntransmission line and substations is completed in the third year of the Project implementation. \nFor the distribution system, a hybrid loan23 approach has been taken, since the impact area \ncannot be determined before appraisal, because of the undeveloped stage of the technical \ndesign. The distribution system will require building poles mainly within existing road ROWs, \nand this should entail only minor impact, which cannot be identified until after the detailed \ndesign of the 230 kV transmission line and substations is finalized. An RF has been prepared \nfor the distribution system to guide the preparation of a short RP during loan implementation. \nThe summary RP and RF is in Appendix 11, and the complete RP and RF are attached as \nsupplementary appendixes. \n63.  Satisfactory resettlement planning and implementation, to mitigate adverse effects, will \nbe done according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, as well as the RP and RF \nadopted for the Project. The impact will be further reduced through careful location of the \ntransmission line alignment and towers during the detailed design. A gender analysis of the \naffected households has been included in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy \n(Appendix 12). Compensation for all lost assets will be provided at replacement cost and at \ncurrent market value, and socioeconomic rehabilitation measures will be provided to ensure that \naffected people will be at least as well off as they would have been without the Project. The \npoorest  affected  and  vulnerable  affected  people  will  be  assisted  in  improving  their \nsocioeconomic status. \nE.  Social Impact \n64.  The social analysis indicates that most of the affected people are Khmer and that 2.4% \nare of Cham descent but are not socioeconomically more vulnerable than the Khmer people \n                                                 \n22 Major impact involves the physical displacement of the affected people from housing or the loss of 10% or more of \ntheir productive income-generating assets, or both. \n23 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2/OP: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila (29 October), para. 40 defines \nhybrid loans and resettlement planning documentation. \n ", "17 \nliving in the project area. The findings do not set off ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The \nsocial and gender strategy in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix \n12) includes capacity building for commune leaders (men and women) and members from \nrelevant agencies. The increased capacity of the commune leaders and affected people will \nenable the effective implementation of resettlement and livelihood activities. The Project will \nincrease the potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases \nbecause  of  the  influx  of  workers  during  construction.  This  potential  will  be  mitigated  or \nminimized through a program to increase awareness and provide preventive measures for the \nlocal communities and the workforce. \nF.  Risks \n65.  The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Tariff and connection charges may \nnot give large-scale consumers enough incentives to switch from their own generation sources \nto EDC\u2019s grid supply. By evacuating imported lower-priced power from Viet Nam, the Project will \nallow EDC to maintain lower tariffs than would have been the case without the Project. In \naddition, the Government will carry out a tariff review to ensure that the tariffs and connection \ncharges are properly set.  \n66.  EDC\u2019s weak financial performance, particularly the arrears from government agencies, is \na potential risk. Concrete and practical financial improvement measures have been developed \n(see details in Appendix 4) and will be closely monitored during project implementation.  \n67.  Another potential risk is the generation source, i.e., whether the required capacity and \nenergy available will be provided. EDC has entered into a power purchase agreement with \nElectricity of Viet Nam to ensure that 200 MW of power will be provided to Cambodia from 2008 \nonward. \n68.  Compensation, resettlement, and income-restoration measures might not be delivered \nas agreed, thereby impoverishing the affected people and delaying the start of civil works. EDC \nwill have specialists to assist in preparing and implementing the RPs, with assistance from \ninternational and national PIC consultants. The impact of resettlement will be further reduced by \ncareful location of the transmission line alignment and towers during detailed design. The PIC \nwill engage an independent monitoring organization for the duration of the resettlement activities. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Financial  matters. During the course of project implementation the financial \ncovenants herein will be periodically reviewed and, unless otherwise agreed with \nADB, EDC will maintain the following financial covenants. \n(a)  A  minimum  DSCR  of  1.3  will  be  achieved  in  FY2007  and  will  be \nmaintained thereafter.  \n(b)  A maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30 will be maintained through 2010.  \n(c)  Revenue  breakeven  will  be  achieved  for  FY2007  and  maintained \nthereafter, such that total operating revenues are equivalent to or not less \nthan the sum of total operating expenses minus depreciation costs.  \n ", "18 \n(d)  The total accounts receivable of EDC will be maintained at a level that \ndoes  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  3  months  of  the  average  sales \nrevenues. \n(e)  The Government will allocate sufficient budget to offset the input VAT \nowed by EDC to the Government\u2019s Customs and Tax Department. \n(f)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  past-due  arrears  of  government \nagencies  with  EDC  for  FY2006  are  paid  or  credited  in  full  by \n30 June 2007.  \n(g)  The  Government  will  credit  or  directly  pay  to  EDC,  from  the  annual \nbudget  allocated  to  each  government  agency,  institution,  and  local \nauthority,  an  estimated  amount  for  each  entity\u2019s  expected  electricity \nconsumption for the coming fiscal year. \n(ii)  Operational matters \n(a)  EDC will maintain its transmission and distribution system losses at a \nlevel not exceeding 16% in FY2006 and thereafter. \n(b)  No later than 3 months prior to the commencement of each fiscal year \nfrom  FY2007,  EDC  will  furnish  ADB  and  JBIC  with  a  draft  power \ndevelopment plan that sets forth the EDC power development plans and \ninvestment requirements for the next 10 years. \n(iii)  Environmental \n(a)  The Government will ensure that the Government\u2019s laws and regulations \nfor  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  are  followed.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy \nbetween the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s requirements, \nthen ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) will prevail. \n(iv)  Land acquisition and resettlement \n(a)  Prior to the commencement of any resettlement activities including the \ndetailed  measurement  survey,  EDC  will  engage  and  mobilize \n(i) resettlement  specialist  consultants  to  assist  in  preparing  and \nimplementing the RPs, and (ii) an independent monitoring organization.  \n(b)  The Government will cause EDC to ensure that all resettlement activities \nas specified in the RPs and RF will be carried out promptly and efficiently \nin accordance with all government laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement, and the approved RP and RF. If there is a \ndiscrepancy between the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, then ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) will \nprevail. \n(c)  EDC  will  ensure  that  (i)  funds  needed  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement are allocated and disbursed in a timely manner; (ii) the RP is \nupdated and submitted to ADB after the detailed measurement surveys \nand detailed design are completed, and approved by ADB before it is \nimplemented; (iii) the updated RP will be disclosed to all affected persons; \nand (iv) ADB is promptly advised of any changes in the resettlement \nimpact,  and  if  necessary,  a  revised  RP  is  submitted  to  ADB  for \nconcurrence. \n ", "19 \n(v)  Others \n(a)  Social issues. The Borrower will ensure that EDC includes the following \nconditions  in  the  civil  works  contract  documents:  (i)  mandatory  \nprovisions on health, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions; \n(ii)  requirements that the contractor comply with all applicable labor \nlaws; (iii) employment targets for women; (iv) appropriate child-care \nfacilities in campsites with women employees; and (v) a dissemination \ncampaign  or  campaigns,  through  a  qualified  nongovernment \norganization  or  other  appropriate  body,  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS), and on the risks of trafficking \nwomen and children, to those employed during project implementation \nand communities in the project area. \n(b)  Benefit  monitoring. Within the first year of electricity connections, a \nbaseline survey will be carried out by EDC, and two years after the \nbaseline survey an impact survey will be carried out by EDC to monitor \nthe Project\u2019s sustainability and development impact. The impact survey \nneeds  to  include  specific  indicators,  which  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation with ADB. \n(c)  Anticorruption. The Government will establish a procurement committee \nto supervise the procurement process, in accordance with the relevant \nADB and government guidelines. The Procurement Committee will be \nestablished by the first quarter of 2007 and chaired by a representative \nfrom  EDC.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  EDC  initiates  semiannual \nliaison meetings with the Borrower\u2019s National Auditor Office in order to \nreview and discuss information with regard to corrupt practices. The \nBorrower will ensure that all project staff fully know and comply with the \nBorrower\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procedures. \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n70.  As  a  condition  for  ADB  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  obtained  the \napproval for cofinancing arrangement from JBIC or made other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for the foreign currency funds, which are anticipated to be provided by JBIC.  \n71.  A subsidiary loan agreement, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB, has been \nduly executed and delivered on behalf of the Government and EDC. \n72.  The Government will submit to the National Assembly for approval an additional budget \nallocation for MEF to enable MEF to offset all the past-due input VAT owed by EDC to the \nGovernment\u2019s  Customs  (about  KR43.5  billion)  and  Tax  Department  (KR19.7  billion)  as  of \n31 December 2005 and the estimated amount for FY2006. \n73.  The Government will submit to the National Assembly for approval an additional budget \nallocation for MEF to enable MEF to offset the arrears of the accounts receivable by EDC from \nthe Government\u2019s institutions, agencies, and local authorities, in an amount recorded by EDC at \napproximately KR22 billion as of 31 December 2005. \n ", "20 \nVI.

Overview \n1.  Cambodia  derives  its  domestic  energy  primarily  from  fuel  wood,  while  commercial \nenergy requirements are met mainly by imported petroleum products. The power supply system \nin Cambodia is dispersed and isolated. Except for Phnom Penh and some towns near the \nThailand  and  Viet  Nam  borders,  the  supply  typically  comprises  diesel  generators  and  the \nassociated distribution system. At present, only 17% of the population has access to electricity \nsupply, and electricity consumption was estimated to be 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per capita in \n2004, the lowest in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n2.  The provision of electricity in Cambodia is the responsibility of Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n(EDC), a government-owned national electricity utility supervised by the Ministry of Industry, \nMines and Energy (MIME) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). As such, EDC is an \nautonomous  limited-liability  company  with  a  consolidated,  nonexclusive  license  from  the \nnational regulator to provide full electricity service to the country as a whole. However, at \npresent, EDC operates only the isolated systems of Phnom Penh and five other provincial \ntowns, namely, Sihanoukville, Siem Reap, Battambang, Kampong Cham, and Takeo. Before \nlong, EDC is also expected to take over operational responsibility for seven other provincial \ntowns now under the responsibility of MIME and its provincial offices. EDC is responsible as \nwell for a number of areas where supply is provided by medium-voltage transmission lines from \nViet Nam. The rest of the country is supplied by independent power producers (IPPs) in larger \ntowns and rural electricity enterprises (REEs) in small villages and communes. \n3.  With the passage of the Electricity Law in 2001, the Electricity Authority of Cambodia \n(EAC)  was  created  as  an  independent  regulatory  body  mainly  responsible  for  licensing \noperators; setting tariffs, rates, and charges for electric power services; and approving and \nenforcing appropriate standards for the construction, operation, and maintenance of electricity \nsystems.  \n4.  According  to  the  Electricity  Law,  MIME  has  overall  responsibility  for  setting  and \nadministering  government  policies,  strategies,  and  plans  in  the  power  sector,  as  well  as \ngovernment decisions on such matters as (i) investments in the rehabilitation and development \nof the power sector, (ii) sector restructuring and private sector participation, (iii) promotion of the \nuse of indigenous energy resources, and (iv) planning and agreements on the export and import \nof electricity. \nB.  Power Generation and Supply  \n5.  In the past 5 years, EDC has made tremendous strides in its operation, through the joint \nefforts of the Government, EDC staff, and development partners like the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the World Bank. Electricity sales have more than doubled, and now grow about \n14% yearly on average. Assets have increased by about 50%. The installed generation capacity \nin the major provincial towns served by EDC in 2004 is summarized in Table A3 below. \n6.  Phnom Penh, which has a population of about 1 million, has the only relatively large \npower system in the country and accounts for 70% of the country\u2019s electricity consumption. \nFollowing the commissioning of several generation projects and 115 kV transmission lines, and \nthe upgrading of distribution facilities, EDC has increased its generation capacity continuously. \nEDC\u2019s power system in Phnom Penh serves about 151,000 consumers with a peak demand of \n122 MW in 2004.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  25 \n7.  The EDC branch in Sihanoukville operates an isolated diesel-based electricity supply \nsystem serving about 8,000 consumers with sales of 20.7 GWh in 2004 and a peak demand of \n5 MW. The coverage of the distribution system is limited to the town, beach and port areas, and \nvicinity areas along National Road No. 4 toward Phnom Penh. \nTable A3: Installed Generating Capacity  \n \nInstalled Capacity \nGeneration Plant  Location  (MW)  Ownership \nEDC C2  Phnom Penh  12  EDC \nEDC C3  Phnom Penh  14  EDC \nEDC C5  Phnom Penh  10  EDC \nEDC C6  Phnom Penh  18  EDC \nEDC multiple units  Sihanoukville  11  EDC \nEDC multiple units  Siem Reap  2.5  EDC \nEDC Russian units  Battambang  2.6  EDC \n         Subtotal    70.1   \nIPP-1  Phnom Penh  35  CUPL \nIPP Caterpillar  Phnom Penh  20  Jupiter Power \nIPP Kirirom Hydro  Phnom Penh  30  CETIC \nIPP multiple units  Siem Reap  4.7  Newland \nIPP Cummings  Battambang  2.9  Newland \nIPP multiple units  Kompong Cham  3.6  GTS \nIPP Detroit Diesel  Kompong Cham  0.8  Jupiter Power \nIPP multiple units  Takeo  0.9  Private \n        Subtotal                      97.9   \n Total Capacity     168   \nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, IPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt.  \nSource: EDC. \n8.  An ADB-financed project that included the construction of a new 5 MW diesel power \nplant and the upgrading of the distribution system for EDC Sihanoukville was completed in \n1998. However, because of high growth in power demand, the system is once again severely \nconstrained by a shortage of generating capacity. EDC is negotiating with IPPs to purchase \nadditional power of around 5 MW to supplement its generation capacity.  \n9.  The transmission and distribution networks in Phnom Penh and provincial towns have \nbeen rehabilitated and reinforced, and are being further expanded. Distribution losses have \ntherefore been progressively reduced, from 25% in 1999 to 18% in 2004. Power imports from \nViet Nam at reasonable cost have begun at medium voltage level in the border areas. Bulk \npower purchase agreements at high voltage level from Viet Nam and Thailand have been \nsigned. A 230 kV transmission line project from the Viet Nam border to Phnom Penh is now \nbeing constructed with financing from ADB, World Bank, and Nordic Development Fund. Other \ntransmission and distribution projects are proposed and will begin around 2010. These projects \nwill allow EDC to import a large amount of energy at an acceptable low tariff from neighboring \ncountries to relieve the strain on domestic generation capacity.  \nC.  Sector Development Policies and Strategies   \n10.  In January 2005, MIME issued the Cambodia Energy Strategy, which included proposed \ndevelopment  policies  and  strategies  for  the  power  sector.  The  power  sector  development \nobjectives over the next 15 years are to develop an adequate and reliable electric power source \nand a national power supply network to meet the growing demand. The strategies consist of \n(i) increasing  investment  in  generation  and  transmission  projects,  (ii)  establishing \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \ninterconnections with neighboring countries, (iii) establishing a regulatory framework for the \nsector, (iv) commercializing EDC and other state-owned enterprises, (v) encouraging private \nsector participation, and (vi) promoting an increase in the provincial and rural electrification ratio \namong households to 70% by 2020.  \n11.  The Power Generation Master Plan and National Transmission System Master Plan \nwere developed in 2003 and updated yearly thereafter. Base generation projects with large \ninstalled capacity are planned for Sihanoukville, considering its independent access to imported \noil and the need to reduce the amount of oil transported on the Mekong River. Peak generation \nplants will be developed in Phnom Penh to meet the high growth in peak demand. Small- and \nmedium-sized diesel units will be constructed in the provincial towns as necessary. A least-cost \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  national  transmission  and  distribution  system  was  formulated  to \nachieve the overall sector development objectives.    \nD.  Key Deficiencies and Challenges   \n12.  The  legal  and  policy  framework  for  the  power  sector  in  Cambodia  needs  to  be \nstrengthened. The lack of transparent and competitive processes in IPP project development \nhas (i) raised electricity costs, (ii) created conflict with the optimum use of the transmission line, \nand (iii) discouraged private sector investment. With support from the World Bank and ADB, the \nGovernment is formulating and will adopt a private sector policy.  \n13.  The technical and financial health of the distribution subsector is critical to the future of \npower  supply  development  in  Cambodia.  However,  the  current  policy  framework  is  not \nconducive to the adequate development of the distribution subsector, and more active policies \nand measures encouraging private sector participation across all geographic areas of the power \nmarket are needed to give the population better access to electricity more rapidly. \n14.  With the support of major funding agencies including the World Bank and ADB, an \nenergy sector strategy review is being conducted. The review includes (i) an update of the \nsector development situation, (ii) an assessment of the performance of key sector players, (iii) a \nreview of crucial issues including the long-term sector development strategic framework, and \n(iv) development of, and agreement with the Government, on strategic plans and priority actions \nfor the short to medium term. It will be critical for the Government to adopt and implement \neffectively the outputs of the strategic review.    \n15.  While EDC\u2019s financial performance has improved significantly in the past 5 years, it is \nstill very weak and precarious, mainly because of (i) escalating costs of fuel and purchased \npower, which increased by 24% and 29%, respectively, from FY2003 to FY2005, and the \ninability of EDC to pass on these costs to consumers through tariffs; (ii) large payment arrears \nespecially from government agencies; and (iii) inability of EDC to pass on to consumers (in its \nelectricity  bills)  the  value-added  taxes  (VAT)  it  pays  on  its  power  purchases,  effectively \nsubsidizing consumers at its own expense. \n16.  EDC continues to struggle with the high power generation costs, which are primarily due \nto (i) the expensive power purchased from IPPs, as many of the  IPP contracts were not \nawarded through competitive bidding; (ii) the small-scale generation capacity, which makes \nelectricity more expensive as economies of scale are not achieved; and (iii) the limited access to \nthe capital markets.  \n17.  The limited power grid coverage and unreliable power supply have led many large \nconsumers to continue to rely on in-house generation, with its low efficiency and high costs. \nMore investments in generation, transmission, and distribution projects by the Government and \nthe private sector, as well as external assistance, are highly required.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \nOF ELECTRICIT\u00c9 DU CAMBODGE \nA.  General Overview \n1.  Since its creation in fiscal year 1996, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC) has gradually \nimproved its financial performance. Until 2005, it was mostly unable to make a profit, mainly \nbecause  (i)  its  costs  and  revenues  are  very  sensitive  to  exchange  rate  and  fuel  price \nfluctuations;  (ii)  tariffs  could  not  cover  its  operational  costs;  (iii)  it  had  large  amounts  of \nreceivables  from  government  departments  and  local  authorities;  (iv)  its  dependence  on \nindependent power producers (IPPs) made its power purchases less competitive; and (v) its \ndistribution  losses  were  relatively  high.  However,  its  future  financial  performance  seems \nfavorable, as the Government and EDC have been vigorously devising remedial measures to \ndeal with the problems. The more significant remedial measures include (i) adjusting tariffs \naccording to fluctuations in fuel prices and foreign exchange gain or loss, (ii) allowing EDC to \npurchase from a wider range of sources, (iii) settling past-due government arrears through \nbudget  allocation,  (iv)  converting  to  equity  some  loans  from  international  financiers,  and \n(v) continuously improving EDC\u2019s transmission and distribution systems to reduce losses.  \nB.  Past Financial Performance \n2.  Despite an increase in energy sales from 320 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2000 to 681 \nGWh in 2005 (14%\u201322% annual growth), EDC mostly continued to operate at a loss. Its net loss \nincreased from about KR15 billion in 2000 to KR25 billion in 2005. Although its cash flow \nimproved from about KR4 billion in 2000 to about KR40 billion in 2005, EDC\u2019s revenues could \nnot cover its operating expenses. EDC also faced difficulties in its debt service requirement, as \nthe ratios were mostly less than 1. Investments in EDC were not attractive, as its rates of return \nwere below 2%. Overall, EDC\u2019s previous financial performance was poor. Details of EDC\u2019s \nfinancial performance and projections are presented in Supplementary Appendix E. \nC.  Past Key Financial Issues  \n \n3.  Insufficient Tariff. EDC\u2019s weak financial performance was mainly due to low tariffs, as \nits main sources of income were insufficient to cover its costs. Tariffs in the last 5 years mostly \nfell short, except in 2001\u20132002. \n \n4.  Outstanding  Government  Arrears.  EDC\u2019s  financial  performance  has  been  further \nadversely affected by the slow collection of accounts receivable from government departments \nand local authorities. EDC continued to struggle with the collection of government arrears and \ncompliance with the receivables covenant. Accounts receivable in 2004 totaled KR76 billion, of \nwhich  KR47  billion  represented  past-due  arrears  of  various  government  ministries  and \nagencies.  \n \n5.  Sensitivity to Exchange Rate and Fuel Price Fluctuations. More than 75% of EDC\u2019s \noperational costs were dollar-based because EDC\u2019s generation was almost exclusively based \non imported fuel and IPPs, both payable in dollars. Therefore, EDC was extremely sensitive to \nfuel cost and exchange rate fluctuations. The riel depreciated from $1:KR2,600 in 1995 to \n$1:KR3,800 in 2002 and about $1:KR4,000 in 2005. The steady increase in the price of crude \noil has also severely affected EDC\u2019s financial performance over the years. \n6.  Less Competitive IPPs. As of 2003, about 45% of the EDC generation capacity system \nwas provided by IPPs, and these are likely to continue to have a significant role in providing \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \ngeneration in towns. The earlier IPP experience was not good, as purchased power prices were \nhigh in the absence of competitive selection procedures. EDC had had little experience in \nnegotiating these contracts and had allowed itself to be advised by the investors themselves \nand by lawyers acting in the investors\u2019 behalf.  \n7.  Distribution Losses. Some networks suffered from power interruptions because of poor \nand minimally maintained distribution networks. Although EDC has continuously improved its \nsystems, the average losses were 25% in FY1999 and 11.5% in FY2005. \nD.  Compliance with Financial Covenants  \n8.  In  the  first  ADB  loan  for  power  rehabilitation  project,1 EDC  agreed  to  achieve  the \nfollowing loan covenants (by 2000): (i) 30% minimum self-financing ratio (SFR), (ii) 1.3 debt \nservice coverage ratio (DSCR), (iii) accounts receivable not exceeding 3 months of electricity \nsales, and (iv) debt-to-equity ratio not to exceed 60:40. The principal financial covenants for \nanother loan project2 focused on adjusting tariffs to achieve at least cash breakeven, improving \nDSCR to 1.2, and reducing the distribution losses to less than 17%. The progress and remedial \nmeasures under each covenant are as follows.  \n9.  Reduced Government Arrears. The Government has satisfactorily complied with this \ncovenant. In FY2003, the Government took measures to address the long-standing issue in the \n2003 financial action plans by offsetting receivables against taxes and duties. The Government \nhas increased its budget allocation for electricity payments and allocated a budget for settling \npast-due arrears. As shown in Table A4.1, the total government arrears were reduced from \nKR47 billion in 2004 to KR28.8 billion by December 2005. By the end of that period, the amount \nowed from government institutions that was more than 3 months overdue represented only \naround 3 weeks of electricity sales. Furthermore, MEF agreed to implement a government \narrears management plan focused on maintaining total accounts receivable at 3 months of \nEDC\u2019s average sales.  \nTable A4.1: Aged Accounts Receivable, as of 31 March 2005  \n \n[THIS INFORMATION WAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL ACCORDING TO EXCEPTION #18 \nOF ADB\u2019S PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY]. \n \n10.  Lower  Debt-to-Equity  Ratio.  EDC  has  satisfactorily  complied  with  this  covenant. \nDespite cumulative losses of KR87 billion in 2002 and KR146 billion in 2004, EDC\u2019s financial \nperformance improved because of the Government\u2019s conversion to equity of the following funds: \n(i)  $25  million  of  the  ADB  loan,  (ii)  $15  million  from  the  Japanese-funded  Phnom  Penh \ndistribution project, and (iii) additional contributions of about $20 million in 2002\u20132003. The \ndebt-to-equity ratio improved from 58:42 in 1999 to 48:52 in 2005. \n11.  Reduced  Distribution  Losses. EDC has fully complied with the distribution losses \ncovenant, as such losses declined from 25% in 1999 to 11.5% in 2005. EDC will continue to \n(i) identify and take advantage of loss reduction opportunities in the weakest areas of the \nsystem, (ii) require industrial and big commercial customers to install capacitors to maintain the \nminimum power factors, (iii) set up vigilance squads to conduct surprise checks at costumers\u2019 \npremises  to  detect  energy  theft,  (iv)  introduce  energy  audit  systems,  and  (v)  implement \nincentive  schemes.  With  such  measures,  the distribution  losses are  expected  to  decrease \nfurther.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1994.

However, EDC has not fully complied with other covenants (breakeven, DSCR of 1.3, \nand SFR of 30%) mainly because of its substantial operating losses. EDC still cannot pass on \nthe  escalating  costs  of  fuel  and  purchased  power  to  consumers  through  tariffs.  However, \neffective 1 July 2005, the Government has rationalized tariffs by (i) introducing an automatic \nadjustment to the cost of EDC\u2019s power purchases in dollar terms, such that the revised tariffs \napplied to industrial and commercial (medium and large) customers were linked to fuel price \nfluctuations, foreign exchange gain or loss, and quantity of power purchased from various EDC \nsources; (ii) having one tariff level for industrial and commercial (small and medium) consumers; \nand (iii) rationalizing the lifeline tariffs, such that subsidized rates (at KR350/kWh) were charged \nfor consumption not exceeding 50 kWh/month.  \n13.  Rounds of tariff setting took place not only in Phnom Penh and immediate environs but \nalso in all EDC branches to improve EDC\u2019s overall financial performance. The Government also \nacted to rationalize electricity tariffs by changing subsidized tariff rates and applying automatic \nadjustments to the tariff applicable to small commercial and industrial consumers in Phnom \nPenh, Kandal, and Kampong Speu provinces. The new power tariffs, which effectively raise the \naverage tariffs of local residential, embassy and foreign residential, and government consumers \nby 11%, took effect on 1 November 2005. These adjustments will contribute to achieving a tariff \nsurplus, as targeted in Table A4.2. \nTable A4.2: EDC\u2019s Revenue Requirements and Tariffs, 2005\u20132010  \n(KR billion) \nItem  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012 \nFuel Cost   35  21  27  27  27  27  27 \nPower Purchase  354  424  481  525  571  614  664 \nOther Operating Costs  34  34  42  46  50  55  60 \nDepreciation  40  49  56  59  61  63  66 \nTotal Costs  462  528  605  656  709  759  816 \nTotal Revenue   467  539  642  718  796  870  955 \nAverage Tariff  628  628  628  628  628  628  629 \nTariff Surplus (%)  1  2  6  9  11  13  15 \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge estimates. \n14.  EDC did not achieve the cash breakeven targets because of its substantial operating \nlosses.  EDC  continuously  struggled  with  the  collection  of  government  arrears,  as  several \nministries either had insufficient resources or assigned a low priority to the payment of electricity \nbills. For example, total consumption for FY2005 exceeded the KR67 billion budgeted by the \nGovernment. In September 2003, the Government decided that input value added taxes (VAT) \nwould  be  a  subsidy  to  customers  with  the  Government  reimbursing  EDC  for  past  VAT \n(calculated at KR40 billion from FY2002). EDC and MEF are preparing a detailed time-bound \naction plan for potentially offsetting the reimbursement of VAT against the repayment of EDC\u2019s \nloans to MEF (about $15 million as of December 2005). \nE.  EDC\u2019s Projected Financial Performance \n15.  Given the remedial measures discussed in paras. 10\u201314, the following are the main \nassumptions regarding EDC\u2019s future financial performance: (i) sales will grow from 943 GWh in \n2006 to 2,181 GWh in 2012, for an average annual growth rate of 15%; (ii) average tariffs will \nincrease from KR666 in 2006 to KR711 in 2012; (iii) the share of power imported from Viet Nam \nin the total power generated will increase from 0% in 2006 to 49% in 2012; and (iv) the riel will \ndepreciate versus the US dollar from $1:KR4,126 in 2006 to $1:KR4,404 in 2012.  \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \n16.  These assumptions indicate that EDC will make a small profit of about KR4.9 billion in \n2006, and then the profit will grow significantly over the rest of the forecast period. There will \nalso be significant improvements in most of EDC\u2019s financial ratios as follows: (i) the current \noperating ratio will always be higher than 1, indicating that cash flow is adequate to cover EDC\u2019s \nexpenses; (ii) rate of returns will also be more than 12%, indicating that investments will be \nprofitable; (iii) SFR, starting in 2010, will be more than 30%, indicating adequate self-financing \nfor investments; and (iv) DSCR will be more than 1.5 over the next decade, improving EDC\u2019s \nability to repay its debts. \nF.  Proposed Financial Covenants  \n17.  With the Government\u2019s decision to adjust average tariffs and implement other remedial \nmeasures, EDC can look forward to a better financial performance by FY2007 and beyond. This \nwould allow EDC to continue operating more efficiently and comply with the agreed covenants. \nDuring project implementation these financial covenants shall be periodically reviewed. Unless it \nagrees otherwise with ADB, EDC will be expected to adhere to the following covenants: \n(i)  A DSCR of 1.3 shall be achieved by FY2007 and maintained thereafter.  \n(ii)  A maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30 shall be maintained up to 2010.  \n(iii)  The revenue breakeven shall be achieved for FY2007. This means that operating \nrevenues are equivalent to or not less than the sum of total operating expenses \nminus depreciation costs.  \n(iv)  The total accounts receivable of EDC shall be maintained at a level that does not \nexceed the equivalent of 3 months of the average sales revenues.  \n(v)  The Government will allocate sufficient budget to offset the input VAT owed by \nEDC to the Government\u2019s Customs and Tax Department. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that past-due arrears of government agencies with \nEDC for FY2006 are paid or credited in full by 30 June 2007. \n18.  The Government will credit or directly pay to EDC, from the annual budget allocated to \neach government agency, institution, and local authority, an estimated amount for each entity\u2019s \nexpected electricity consumption for the coming fiscal year. \n ", "  \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1: Summary of Detailed Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n        (KR million)  ($ million)  % Foreign  % Total \nItem  Local  Foreign  Total  Local  Foreign Total  Exchange  Base Costs \nA.

The energy demand forecasts updated by Electricit\u00e9 du \nCambodge (EDC) in June 2005 are shown in Table A9.1. \n \nTable A9.1: South Grid Energy Demand Forecast (GWh) \n \nItem 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\nPhnom Penh       7 36       8 44       9 75    1 ,163    1 ,302    1 ,445    1 ,585    1 ,740    1 ,921    2 ,118\nKampong Speu        3 .0        3 .6        4 .2        4 .7        5 .3        5 .9        6 .6        7 .3        8 .1        9 .0\nTakeo        3 .8        4 .5        5 .3        6 .1        7 .0        7 .9        8 .9      1 0.0      1 1.2      1 2.5\nKampot        3 .9        4 .5        5 .0        5 .6        6 .1        6 .7        7 .4        8 .1        8 .9        9 .7\nSihanoukville         4 7         5 6         6 3       1 15       1 89       2 60       2 89       3 18       3 48       3 78\nTotal       7 94       9 13    1 ,053    1 ,294    1 ,509    1 ,726    1 ,897    2 ,083    2 ,297    2 ,527  \nSource: EDC, June 2005, (Sihanoukville: ADB estimates.) \n \n3.  These cities are not yet connected except Phnom Penh and Kampong Speu. In 2008, \nTakeo will be connected with Phnom Penh by a 230 kV interconnection line between Viet Nam \nand Phnom Penh and will be brought into the South Grid. In the same year, Kampot will also be \nconnected with Takeo and will be brought into the grid by a 230 kV transmission line under a \nproject funded by German development cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW). \n \n2.  Demand Forecast for Sihanoukville \n4.  For the demand forecast for Sihanoukville, the methodology used a combination of \nforecasts on the large consumer surveys and information on the Sihanoukville Growth Corridor \nDevelopment Plan. The load forecast for the city is divided into two parts: (i) the forecast for the \nEDC system, and (ii) the forecast for captive consumers that generate their own electricity.  \n5.  For the load forecast for the EDC system in Sihanoukville, estimates were developed to \nforecast  electricity  demand  for  four  sectors  between  2006  and  2035.  These  sectors  are \nresidential, commercial entities, small and large industry, and Government. The key parameters \nfor deriving the demand forecast for the EDC system are population growth, GDP growth, and \nconnection rates. The assumed population growth rate is 3.5%, which is higher than the national \naverage rate of 2.5%, because of the growth potential of Sihanoukville and surrounding areas. \nThe GDP growth rate adopted for the region is 4%, which again is higher than the projected \nnational  average  rate  of  3.5%.  Income  elasticity  of  demand  was  calculated  for  residential \nconsumption per consumer. Elasticity of 1.21 was obtained on the basis of the data. Rates of \n ", "40  Appendix 9 \nconnection  to  each  district  in  Sihanoukville,  and  consumption  and  consumer  growth  rates \nadopted for the other sectors, are shown in Table A9.2. A detailed forecast was prepared up to \n2015 and projected to 2035 using the assumptions in Table A9.3.  \n \nTable A9.2: Energy Demand Forecast Assumptions for EDC System in Sihanoukville \n \nResidential Consumers Connection Rates\nMittakpheap 51.6% in 2006, increasing 1% per year\nPrey Nob 10.0% in 2006, increasing 3% per year for 4 years and 2% per year thereafter\nSteung Hav 10.0% in 2006, increasing 3% per year for 4 years and 2% per year thereafter\nNos. of Consumers\nCommercial 9% of resident consumers\nIndustrial  10% p.a. growth for 2 years, reducing to 5% by 2013\nGovernment in line with population growth (3.5%)\nkWh/Consumer (% p.a. growth)\nCommercial 3.0\nIndustrial  6.0\nGovernment 1.0\n \nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, kWh = kilowatt-hour, Nos. = number, p.a. = per annum. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nTable A9.3: Sales Growth Rates of EDC System in Sihanoukville (%) (2016\u20132035) \n \nItem 2016\u20132020 2021\u20132025 2026\u20132035\nResidential 9.0 6.0 4.0\nCommercial 8.0 5.0 3.0\nIndustry 5.0 3.0 2.0\nGovernment 3.5 3.5 3.5\n \nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  The  energy  demand  forecast  for  captive  consumers  in  Sihanoukville  includes  the \nfollowing  elements:  (i)  existing  major  industrial  consumers,  (ii)  international  tourist  hotels, \n(iii) Sihanoukville port, and (iv) the planned special economic zone in the city. The forecast \nassumptions are shown in Table A9.4. \nC.   Least-Cost Analysis \n7.  The least-cost analysis minimizes the present value of the South Grid expansion cost \nfrom 2007 to 2035. All values are expressed in world prices in constant 2005 dollars and \ndiscounted over  30  years  using  a  discount  factor  of  12%.  The  analysis  has  the  following \nassumptions; (i) the dispatching power would be provided by committed independent power \nproducers (IPP) and committed Viet Nam imports, followed by EDC\u2019s diesel power plants and \ndiesel oil fuel\u2013type gas power plants, and (iii) 10% reserve margin would be maintained. These \nEDC  power  plants  are  phased  such  that  they  would  meet  the  South  Grid  load  demand, \n ", "  Appendix 9  41 \nminimizing the generation cost. The base case for the analysis is to construct the transmission \nline between Sihanoukville and Kampot in 2010.  \nTable A9.4: Load Forecast Assumptions for Captive Demand in Sihanoukville \nItem Assumption\nShoe factory 5% per year from 2006 to 2009, then constant\nBrewery 6% constant\nTextile factory (1) 5% per year from 2006 to 2010, then constant\nTextile factory (2) 5% per year from 2006 to 2009, then constant\nGarment factories 50% in 2006, then constant\nSeafood processing 5% per year constant\nInternational hotel 70% occupancy by 2006; 5 % per year from 2007 to 2008, then constant\nOther hotels one other similar development by 2006, 5% growth per year therafter\nSHV Port Autority 40% per year from 2005 to 2009, then 15% per year thereafter\nSHV SEZ (1) 200% in 2009, 67% in 2010, then constant\nSHV SEZ (2) 100% in 2009, reducing to 14% by 2015\n \nSHV = Sihanoukville, SEZ = Special Economic Zone. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  Without the transmission line project, the feasible least-cost alternative is to add several \ndiesel power plants in Sihanoukville to meet the increasing demand. It is assumed that the \nalternative represents the without-project case. The with-project scenario would result in lower \nsystem expansion costs compared with the alternative without-project scenario. This shows that \nthe transmission line is the least-cost option (Table A9.5). \nD.   Valuation of Project Costs and Benefits \n  1.  Project Costs \n9.   The financial capital costs are adjusted in the economic analysis to reflect the economic \ncost of project inputs in terms of the world price numeraire. The capital costs are classified into \ntradable goods and services, and non-tradable goods and services. The cost of unskilled labor \nis insignificant in total cost, and no shadow wage rate factor was applied. The non-tradable \ngoods and services are converted to world price numeraire using a standard conversion factor \nof 0.9. Classification of costs is based on the engineering estimate (Table A9.6). The costs, \nincluding  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  taxes,  duties,  and  price  contingency,  are \nestimated to be $45.2 million at constant 2005 prices. The costs of operating and maintaining \nthe transmission line are included in the analysis; these costs are estimated at 2.0% of the \ncapital cost yearly. \n2.  Project Benefits  \n10.   The  project  benefits  are  the  cost  savings  resulting  from  the  South  Grid  System \nexpansion between the with-project and the without-project scenario. For the without-project \ncase,  the  alternative  to  the  Project  is  to  construct  several  small  diesel  power  plants  in \nSihanoukville; this requires relatively high investment and operation costs. For the with-project \ncase, the Project will integrate Sihanoukville into the South Grid, and lessen the total system \nexpansion cost, since the large South Grid power plants are more economical than the city\u2019s \nsmaller plants.  \nE.

Introduction \n1.  The Project was subjected to financial analysis, on the basis of with- and without-the-\nProject scenarios, to arrive at the incremental benefits and costs, and compute the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR).  Project  viability  was  assessed  by  comparing  FIRR  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC). The sensitivity analysis, through sensitivity indicators, \nassesses the effects of likely changes in the key variables of the Project, such as demand, cost, \nand revenues, on the base-case FIRR. These show the influence of these variables on the \nviability of the Project. The switching values are used to determine those variables that are most \nlikely  to  affect  the  project  financial  performance.  The  following  paragraphs  explore  these \nassessments.  \nB.  Assumptions of Project Benefits  \n2.  The benefits are essentially derived from the increase in electricity sales due to load \ngrowth, and from savings due to electricity loss reduction in the project areas. A model was \ndeveloped to forecast the trend in electricity consumption for the following current customers of \nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC): residential, commercial and hotels, industries, and government \nagencies. The model also includes a forecast of captive demand of large hotels and industries \nthat now generate their own energy needs. For financial analysis, we have adopted the load \nforecast in Cambodia, presented in the Economic Analysis (Appendix 9), as the scenario for the \nproject area (Sihanoukville), which is considered realistically achievable at prevailing tariff levels.  \n3.  An analysis of the demand forecast revealed that the demand would exceed EDC\u2019s \ngenerating capacity until the transmission and distribution lines are completed. The Project will \nhelp the large hotels and industries gain access to cheaper power, as EDC\u2019s tariffs for hotels, \ncommercial entities, and industries (Table A10.1) are much lower than the costs of power \ngenerated by the private sector (Table A10.2). It is expected that these industries will gradually \nshift to EDC\u2019s supply since the transmission line from Viet Nam to Phnom Penh will be in \nservice by 2008, and the line from Takeo to Kampot, by 2009. \n \nTable A10.1: EDC Tariffs in Sihanoukville \n \nCustomers   Riel/kWh  $/kWh \nResidential  720.00  0.178 \nGovernment  760.00  0.188 \nHotel and commercial  740.00  0.183 \nIndustrial  670.00  0.166 \nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge. \n \nTable A10.2: Costs of Energy Generated from Various Sources \n($/kWh) \nMarket Price  Market Price \nSources of Energy  including Taxes  excluding Taxes \nCost of energy imported from Viet Nam  0.0641  0.0599 \nCost of energy from large diesel plant  0.0888  0.0868 \nCost of energy from small diesel plant  0.1093  0.1071 \nCost of energy from private diesel plant  0.2082  0.0776 \n$/kWh = dollar per kilowatt-hour \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, 2005. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \n \n4.  The benefits from the incremental sales were valued in terms of annual average tariff \nrevenue  and  the  demand  forecast  and  then  adjusted  to  constant  2005  price  levels.  The \ncomputations for each category of customers used prevailing tariff rates in Sihanoukville, as \nshown in Table A10.1, to arrive at the Project\u2019s total financial benefits. It is assumed that the \nrevenue flow for the Project will start in 2010, when the project construction will be completed, \nand end in 2036, in accordance with the economic life of the transmission and distribution lines.  \nC.  Project Cost Assumptions \n5.  The total cost of the Project is not segregated by subproject, but was derived from the \ntotal cost of the Project in proportion to total sales. The cost of energy purchased is the main \nsource of the project costs. It is more than 60% of the costs. It is valued at either the cost of \nenergy imported from Viet Nam that cannot be used by EDC in Phnom Penh (estimated at \n$0.060/kWh), and the additional cost of energy from future large diesel generating plants in \nPhnom Penh (estimated at $0.087/kWh). The generation costs of various power producers are \npresented in Table A10.2. \n \n6.  The capital cost of investment is about $47.3 million, derived from the total project costs \nafter deducting interest during construction and price contingencies, disbursed from 2006 to \n2010. The main costs include the cost of the transmission lines plus the associated 22 kV \ndistribution lines, both comprising equipment and civil works. Land acquisition, resettlement, \nand capacity-building costs are also included. \n \n7.  The following are additional costs for the Project: (i) the operation and maintenance \ncosts of the transmission line, estimated at 2% of the capital cost of the line per year; (ii) the \noperation and maintenance cost of the distribution line in Sihanoukville, estimated at KR15/kWh; \n(iii) allowance for the capital cost of the distribution system in Sihanoukville required to meet the \nforecast demand, estimated at $0.114/kWh of incremental demand; and (iv) allowance for duties \nand taxes on the capital cost of the Project, plus the cost of imported fuel and other charges. \n \n8.  The analysis runs from 2006, when the transmission and distribution lines are assumed \nto be constructed, until 2036, when the lines are assumed to be at the end of their economic \nlives. On the basis of the above assumptions for the benefit and cost analysis, the post-tax \nFIRR for the Project was estimated at 13.2% in real terms, as in Table A10.3. \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n9.  The Project is funded by ADB, from its Asian Development Fund (ADF), Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The cost of \ndebt between ADB and JBIC is assumed to be the same, with the following terms: (i) interest \nrate of 1% per year will be applied; and (ii) MEF will relend the loan to EDC for a 20-year term, \nincluding  a  5-year  grace  period,  at  4.2%  interest.  EDC  will  allocate  an  annual  budget  as \ncounterpart funds, with the nominal cost of 20.6%. The tax-adjusted cost is the 9% corporate tax \nrate, the same for the three financiers, Table A10.4 presents the financial parameters used by \neach financier including the computation of WACC. The resulting WACC was 4.3%, lower than \nthe FIRR of the Project. This indicates that the Project is financially viable. \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values \n10.  A  risk  analysis  was  undertaken  to  examine  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in  the \nfollowing key variables on the financial viability of the Project: (i) a 20% reduction in load \ngrowth/demand due to potential economic recession or other factors; (ii) a 2-year delay in the \nconstruction of the transmission line resulting in commissioning in 2013, as opposed to 2009 in \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nthe base scenario; (iii) an increase of 20% in the total construction cost of the Project; (iv) 30% \narrears in accounts receivable; (v) a 20% reduction in the commercial and industrial tariff rates \nonce  the  transmission  line  is  completed;  (vi)  a  combination  of  25%  arrears  in  accounts \nreceivable and 20% increase of power purchase price; and (vii) a combination of 20% increase \nin construction cost and 20% decrease in demand. The impact of these changes on FIRR, \nsensitivity indicators, and the switching value is presented in Table A10.5. \nTable A10.3: Financial Analysis of the Project \n($ million) \nCost of  Distribution  Taxes \nSales  Energy  Transmission  Distribution  Capital  Capital  and  Total  Net \nYear  Revenue  Purchased  O&M  O&M  Investment  Investment  Charges  Outflows  Inflow \n2007  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  14.0  3.5  17.5  (17.5) \n2008  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  18.7  2.2  20.9  (20.9) \n2009                 9.3  0.2  9.5  (9.5) \n2010  10.8  17.7  1.1  0.8  0.5  4.7  0.6  25.3  (14.5) \n2011  16.0  19.6  1.1  0.9  0.5  0.0  0.6  22.8  (6.7) \n2012  22.1  26.5  1.1  1.2  0.6  0.0  0.8  30.1  (8.0) \n2013  27.5  26.8  1.1  1.2  0.6  0.0  0.8  30.6  (3.1) \n2014  32.9  27.2  1.1  1.3  0.7  0.0  0.8  31.0  1.9 \n2015  38.5  27.6  1.1  1.3  0.8  0.0  0.9  31.5  6.9 \n2016  44.0  27.9  1.1  1.3  0.7  0.0  0.9  31.9  12.1 \n2017  49.6  30.1  1.1  1.3  0.7  0.0  0.8  34.0  15.6 \n2018  55.3  31.8  1.1  1.4  0.8  0.0  0.7  35.7  19.6 \n2019  61.2  32.5  1.1  1.4  0.9  0.0  0.7  36.6  24.6 \n2020  62.6  33.3  1.1  1.4  0.9  0.0  0.8  37.5  25.1 \n2021  63.7  33.9  1.1  1.4  0.7  0.0  0.8  37.9  25.8 \n2022  64.8  34.5  1.1  1.5  0.7  0.0  0.8  38.5  26.2 \n2023  65.9  35.1  1.1  1.5  0.8  0.0  0.8  39.2  26.7 \n2024  67.1  35.8  1.1  1.5  0.8  0.0  0.8  40.0  27.1 \n2025  68.4  36.5  1.1  1.6  0.8  0.0  0.8  40.8  27.6 \n2026  69.3  37.0  1.1  1.6  0.6  0.0  0.8  41.1  28.2 \n2027  70.2  37.5  1.1  1.6  0.6  0.0  0.9  41.6  28.6 \n2028  71.2  38.0  1.1  1.6  0.6  0.0  0.9  42.2  29.0 \n2029  72.2  38.6  1.1  1.6  0.7  0.0  0.9  42.8  29.4 \n2030  73.2  39.1  1.1  1.7  0.7  0.0  0.9  43.4  29.8 \n2031  74.3  39.7  1.1  1.7  0.7  0.0  0.9  44.1  30.2 \n2032  75.4  40.3  1.1  1.7  0.7  0.0  0.9  44.8  30.6 \n2033  76.5  40.9  1.1  1.8  0.8  0.0  0.9  45.4  31.0 \n2034  77.7  41.6  1.1  1.8  0.8  0.0  0.9  46.2  31.5 \n2035  78.9  42.3  1.1  1.8  0.8  0.0  1.0  46.9  32.0 \nDiscount \nNPV  FIRR \n              Rate \n         \n              5.8%  96.3   13.2% \n( ) = negative, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 10  47 \n \nTable A10.4: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) \n \nItem  ADB  JBIC  Government  Total \nA.

As shown in Table A10.5, the Project is robust for a potential decrease in load growth, \nincrease in construction cost, increase in the price of power purchases, and 2 years\u2019 delay in \ncompleting the Project. For example, a 20% increase of the construction cost will reduce FIRR \nto 9.1%; and a 30% increase in the power purchase price will reduce the FIRR to 8.2%. The \n30% arrears in accounts receivable will reduce the FIRR to 5.2%. The changes in these key \nvariables will not adversely affect the Project, as those FIRRs are still above its WACC. \n \n13.  The Project, however, is sensitive to the combination of arrears in accounts receivable \nand an increase in power purchase price. As shown in Table A10.6, the combination of an \nincrease in arrears and in power purchase price will reduce the FIRR to 4.3%, equal to the \nWACC. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \n14.  The sensitivity indicators indicate that the arrears in accounts receivable, the reduction in \nload growth, and the reduction in commercial and industrial tariffs are more sensitive than the \nadverse changes in other key variables. The FIRRs will be equal to the WACC of the Project \nunder the following conditions: (i) load growth is reduced to 20.8%, (ii) construction costs \nincrease by about 23%, (iii) arrears in accounts receivable reach 24%, and (iv) commercial and \nindustrial tariffs are reduced by 29%. But overall, the Project remains financially viable under the \nvarious ranges of scenarios for its sensitivity. \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \nA.  Introduction \n1.  A resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared for the core project involving a 78 kilometer \n(km), 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line between Kampot and Sihanoukville and two substations \nat Veal Renh and Sihanoukville. The RP is based on agreed objectives, policies, screening, and \nplanning procedures in accordance with the  Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s)  Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  laws  of  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia, \nprincipally the Land Law, revised in 2001, and the Electricity Law, 2001. \n2.  A resettlement framework (RF) has also been prepared to guide the preparation of one \nor more subproject RPs for the proposed medium- and low-voltage distribution systems. For \nthese systems, little if any land acquisition impact will be caused by the erection of conventional \nmedium-voltage 22 kV double-circuit distribution lines in Sihanoukville connecting the 230 kV \nsubstation and the existing 22 kV network, and 22 kV feeders from Sihanoukville and Veal Renh \nsubstations serving nearby villages, and the erection of 22 kV and 400 V distribution lines \nserving the villages along the transmission line corridor, as poles will be constructed mainly \nalong existing road or rail rights-of-way (ROW). The alignment of the distribution systems will be \nmade in consultation with local communities, with the objective of avoiding or minimizing impact \nwherever possible. \n3.  Provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  RP  and  RF,  and  in  the  RPs  that  will  be \nprepared  subsequently,  will  supersede  the  provisions  of  relevant  legislation  in  force  in \nCambodia wherever they diverge. \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact  \n4.  The  RP  for  the  transmission line and  substations  was  prepared  on  the  basis of  a \nfeasibility study using line locations on orthophoto maps (1997) and global positioning system \nlocation  surveys  of  the  transmission  alignment.  The  230  kV  Kampot-to-Sihanoukville \ntransmission  line  route  was  aligned  to  avoid  densely  populated  areas  and  minimize  the \nresettlement impact. The ROW will be cleared of all structures and trees above 3 meters (m), as \nuse of the ROW during operations will be restricted to crops and trees below this height. Only \n12 houses (occupied by 70 people) and 26 structures are located along the transmission line \ncorridor; of the 12 houses, 5 will be moved to new sites within the village and 7 to property \nadjacent to the ROW and owned by the household. Some 14 temporary sheds on government \nland in the buffer zone of Bokor National Park may also be moved outside the ROW onto \nimmediately adjacent land. The Project will acquire 3.9 hectares (ha) of agricultural land for the \nestimated 222 transmission line towers (2.2 ha) and two substation sites (1.7 ha). A total of 731 \nhouseholds are likely to be affected by the ROW. An estimated 2,929 trees, consisting of 2,087 \nfruit trees (mainly coconut palm, durian, mango, and cashew) and 842 non-fruit trees (mainly \nsandalwood and acacia), could also be affected. Some of these trees are in plantations held by \nnonresident owners. The livelihood impact of the loss of trees will be known only after the \ncompletion of the detailed design and detailed measurement survey during implementation. No \nfarmers are expected to be severely affected by the loss of land. Compensation at replacement \ncost will be paid for land under the structures, and an easement fee of 15% of replacement cost \nfor other residential land not under structures. All land within the ROW that is not permanently \nacquired for towers will continue to be the property of the owner, but with restricted use. \nC.  Project Resettlement Objectives, Principles, and Entitlement Policy  \n5.  Resettlement Objectives. The RP and RF aim to ensure that the losses incurred by \naffected people are redressed such that affected people are assisted in developing their social \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nand economic potential to improve or at least restore their incomes and living standards to pre-\nproject levels, and they are not worse off than they would have been without the Project. \n6.  Resettlement  Principles.  The  above  objectives  will  be  accomplished  through  the \nfollowing resettlement principles adopted for the Project:  \n(i)  Acquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people,  will  be \nminimized  as  much  as  possible  by  identifying  possible  alternative  project \ndesigns,  and  appropriate  social,  economic,  operational,  and  engineering \nsolutions that have the least impact on populations in the project area. \n(ii)  The populations affected by the Project are defined as those that may stand to \nlose,  as  a  consequence  of  the  Project,  all  or  part  of  their  physical  and \nnonphysical assets, including homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial \nproperties, tenancy, income-earning opportunities, social and cultural activities, \nand  relationships,  as  well  as  other  losses  that  may  be  identified  during  the \nresettlement planning. \n(iii)  All affected persons (AP) identified in the project-affected areas as of the date of \nthe updated census and inventory of losses after detailed design will be entitled \nto  compensation  for  their  lost  assets,  incomes,  and  businesses  at  full \nreplacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist \nthem  in  improving  or  at  least  maintaining  their  pre-project  living  standards, \nincome-earning capacity, and production levels. \n(iv)  All  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  assistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic \nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the \nobjectives outlined above. Those without legal title to land or structures occupied \nor used by them will be entitled to various kinds of resettlement assistance, \nprovided they have cultivated or otherwise occupied the land before the eligibility \ncutoff date. Resettlement assistance to non-titled APs will include compensation \nfor  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost  and  restoration  of  income  and  living \nstandards. \n(v)  The  rehabilitation  measures  to  be  provided  are  (a)  cash  compensation  for \nhouses and other structures at replacement cost of materials and labor without \ndeduction for depreciation or salvageable materials; (b) full title to replacement \nagricultural land for land of equal productive capacity acceptable to the AP, \nincluding the cost of landfill if needed, or, at the informed decision of the AP, \ncash equivalent to replacement cost at the current market value for buying the \nsame;  (c)  full  title  to  replacement  residential  and  commercial  land  under \nstructures that must be displaced for safety clearance, replacement land of equal \nsize in the same village, acceptable to the AP, or, at the informed decision of the \nAP, cash for replacement land at replacement cost at current market value for \nbuying the same; (d) easement fee for residential land not under structures, to be \nvalued at 15% of the replacement cost of the residential land at the current \nmarket value for buying the same; (e) cash compensation for crops and trees at \nreplacement  cost,  including  compensation  for  a  minimum  of  5  years\u2019  lost \nproductivity for trees and perennial crops depending on the tree or crop variety, \nplus provision of saplings, fertilizer, and extension assistance; (f) assistance to \ntenants  paying  rent  on  houses  owned  by  others  by  way  of  3  months\u2019  rent \nallowance;  (g)  compensation  for  lost  business  and  wages;  (h)  relocation \nallowances  and  rehabilitation  assistance:  (i)  cost-of-living  allowance  for  all \nrelocating  households  and  severely  affected  farmers  in  cash  or  in  kind, \nequivalent  to  30  kg  of  rice  per  family  member  each  month  for  6  months; \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n(j) relocation costs through cash payment of $20 per temporary field shelter, $40 \nper house relocated on the same plot, and $60 for houses relocated to another \nplot in the same village; and (k) priority access to project-related employment for \nAPs. \n(vi)  Special  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  RP  and  RF  for \ncomplementary  mitigation  and  enhancement  activities  to  assist,  during  the \ntransition  period,  socially  and  economically  vulnerable  groups  such  as \nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  children,  and  elderly  people  without  support \nstructures,  people  living  in  extreme  poverty,  and  indigenous  and  ethnic \nminorities.  In  addition  to  other  entitlements  and  allowances,  all  poor  and \nvulnerable APs will receive a cash allowance equivalent to 30 kg of rice per \nfamily member per month for 6 months and provided with any other necessary \nsupport to assist them in improving their socioeconomic status. \n(vii)  There will be no deduction in payments for salvage value, depreciation, taxes, \nstamp duty, fees, or any other payments. \n(viii)  Adequate  arrangements  will  be  made  for  the  timely  conduct  of  social \nassessments,  inventory  of  affected  assets,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  the \npreparation and implementation of RPs, including the timely conduct of internal \nand external monitoring of RP implementation. \n(ix)  RPs  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  with  the  participation  of,  and  in \nconsultation with, affected people, and draft and final RPs are to be disclosed to \nAPs in a form and language that they can understand, in an accessible place. \n(x)  Enough  time  will  be  allowed  for  replacement  structures  to  be  built  before \nconstruction begins. \n(xi)  Temporarily affected land and communal infrastructure will be restored to pre-\nproject conditions. \n(xii)  Any  AP\u2019s  loss  due  to  any  acquisition  or  restriction  on  access  to  common \nresources as a common property will be mitigated by arrangements that will \nensure,  as  a  first  option,  that  those  APs  will  have  continuing  access  to  an \nequivalent resource. If this option is not feasible, the alternatives will be identified \nin consultation with APs. \n(xiii)  The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures will be in place and all encumbrances on a contract area \nremoved before the Government and ADB approve the start of civil works for that \ncontract area. \n(xiv)  The Executing Agency will see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to \nensure effective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of \nthe land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n(xv)  Cultural  and  religious  practices  will  be  respected  and,  as  far  as  practical, \npreserved. \n(xvi)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and will be made available to \ncover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation within the \nagreed implementation period. \n(xvii)  Grievance  procedures  will  be  established  and  put  in  place  and  APs  will  be \ninformed of them before any resettlement activities begin. \n(xviii)  Details  of  the  RP  will  be  distributed  to  the  APs  and  placed  in  project  and \ncommune offices for the reference of affected people, as well any interested \ngroups. \n(xix)  Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system and an external \nmonitor hired before the start of any resettlement activities.  \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \n7.  The  project  entitlements  (detailed  in  the  Entitlement  Matrix  in  the  Supplementary \nAppendix) are designed to cover compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets; \nand to restore or enhance the livelihoods of all APs. APs will receive compensation in cash or in \nkind  (e.g.,  replacement  land)  at  replacement  cost  for  affected  assets,  as  well  as  various \nrehabilitation measures. \nD.  Consultation, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure  \n8.  APs and commune leaders were consulted during project preparation to discuss the \nresettlement impact, availability of replacement land, replacement costs for all categories of lost \nassets, and rehabilitation measures and assistance to ensure that APs can restore, if not \nimprove, their livelihoods. Further consultation will be carried out before the design is finalized, \nand will continue during RP updating, preparation, and implementation. A three-step procedure \nwill be established to deal with any resettlement-related issues, concerns, or grievances raised \nduring project implementation and based on preparation and approval of the RP. APs will be \nexempted from administrative fees associated with resolving the grievances. \n9.  A public information booklet was prepared and distributed to all APs before appraisal \nand discussed during commune meetings. Copies of the final translated RP will be placed in the \nrespective district and commune offices. The final version of the agreed and updated RP will \nalso be uploaded onto ADB\u2019s Web site. The updated RP and subproject RPs prepared during \nproject implementation will be disclosed to APs before submission to ADB for review and \napproval; disclosure will include the presentation of the updated public information booklet with \ncompensation unit rates, and discussion in commune meetings. Final RPs and updated RPs will \nalso be disclosed to APs in district and commune offices. \nE.  Gender, Ethnicity, and Poverty Issues  \n10.  Women, ethnic minorities, and poor households are among the most vulnerable groups \naffected by resettlement. The socioeconomic survey identified 37% of the sampled population \nas  being  below  the  poverty  line  or  otherwise  vulnerable,  including  4.7%  female-headed \nhouseholds and 7.0% households who were elderly without support or disabled. However, \nvulnerable households were not found within the households that might consist of project-\naffected people according to the present level of design. In much of the 230 kV transmission line \nproject area, the number and proportion of poor households is indicated to be negligible or \nminor. This situation will be reassessed after the detailed design and detailed measurement \nsurvey. Resettlement planning and implementation will pay special attention to (i) the role of \nwomen\u2019s economic activities in restoring living standards; (ii) access to credit and agricultural \nextension for women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; (iii) joint registration of any land-\nuse rights in the names of both husband and wife where households are allocated alternative \nagricultural or residential land; (iv) participation and consultation strategies that encourage the \ninvolvement of women, ethnic minorities, and poor households in resettlement planning and \nimplementation; (v) complaints and grievances lodged by women, ethnic minorities, and poor \nhouseholds; and (vi) collection of data disaggregated by gender and ethnic minority to support \nresettlement planning and monitoring. A gender strategy has been prepared for the Project and \nis included in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 12). A national \nconsultant  on  gender  and  development  will  be  among  the  consultants  who  will  assist  in \ndeveloping the gender strategy into an implementation plan. Capacity-building training will be \nprovided to men and women commune leaders and AP households to make resettlement \nplanning and implementation more effective. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements and Schedule  \n11.  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC),  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  appoint  a  full-time \nresettlement staff to coordinate closely with the involved ministries and other agencies, as well \nas reassess the actual compensation needs. It will ensure, through its project management \norganization  (PMO),  that  provincial  and  district  resettlement  committee  authorities  are \nappointed. The PMO has been established in Phnom Penh and the appointed authorities will \noperate  under  the  direction  of  the  provincial  governors  of  Kampot  and  Sihanoukville.  In \ncoordination with these relevant agencies, the PMO will manage and supervise the project and \nwill  create  a  social  and  environment  unit  (SEU),  and  will  assign  appropriate  qualified \nresettlement staff for the periods necessary, with responsibility for social issues, particularly (i) \nresettlement planning and management, (ii) HIV/AIDS awareness program, (iii) poverty and \nsocial impact assessments, and (iv) labor practices. EDC will hire at least one new full-time \nresettlement staff who is a recent social science graduate, to be trained on the job by project \nconsultants. \n12.  The project will be implemented over 4 years starting in 2006. The implementation of \nresettlement and related activities will take place after the mobilization of the project supervision \nconsultant, who will work closely with, and assist, the PMO in all resettlement-related activities. \nCivil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession of site for any section of the \nconstruction works unless the PMO has (i) completed, in accordance with the approved relevant \nRP  for  the  230  kV  main  transmission  line  or  any  subproject,  compensation  payment  and \nrelocation to new sites; and (ii) ensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the \narea required for civil works is free of encumbrances.  \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n13.  The implementing agencies (PMO and provincial resettlement committees) will conduct \nregular internal monitoring of the RP implementation. The PMO will submit quarterly monitoring \nreports to ADB. Also, the PMO will engage an independent monitoring organization (IMO) to \nconduct external scheduled monitoring and evaluation, focusing on the social impact of the \nproject and the ability of APs to improve or at least restore their pre-project living standards, \nincomes, and productive capacity. A post-project evaluation study will also be carried out by the \nIMO approximately 1 year after the main 230 KV transmission line is completed. \nH.  Resettlement Budget and Flow of Funds \n14.  The Project has budgeted $1 million for land acquisition and resettlement program costs, \nto  be  financed  from  counterpart  funds.  The  budget  includes  compensation  payments  and \nallowances to APs, relocation costs, mitigation and income restoration measures, administrative \ncosts, and 20% for contingencies. The budget for the transmission line and substation core \nproject is estimated to be $648,000, and another $160,000 (25% of the transmission component \nresettlement costs) is budgeted for the distribution component, which is considered sufficient to \ncover the marginal impact anticipated. The Inter-Ministerial Resettlement Committee will be \nresponsible for providing funds to the provincial resettlement committees for compensation for \nland acquisition and resettlement, including payments to APs directly for land, crops, and trees \nincluding houses, other structures, and any allowances. \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \nThe population of Cambodia is about 13 million, of whom about one third live in poverty. The country\u2019s \ninfrastructure was destroyed significantly during decades of civil war and conflict, and its socioeconomic \nindicators are considered relatively lower than those of other countries in the region. Poverty in Cambodia \nis overwhelmingly rural, from a low of 10\u201315% in Phnom Penh, to 40\u201345% in rural areas. The incidence of \npoverty declined only modestly over the last several years. This is due to a range of factors, including the \nshortage of sources of growth, backward linkages to the domestic economy, and the exclusion of the poor \nfrom the mainstream economy. For the economy to develop, the basic structure must improve. \nThe power sector in Cambodia is both small and highly fragmented, with 24 isolated power systems \ncentered on the various provincial cities and the capital, Phnom Penh. About 85% of the population lives in \nthe rural areas and most do not have access to electricity. Nationwide, less than 17% of the population \nhas access to electricity supply. Electricity consumption per capita is estimated to be 55 kWh in 2004, one \nof the lowest in the region. In addition, the lack of an integrated high-voltage transmission system and \ninterconnections to adjacent countries and the high cost of imported diesel fuel have resulted in electricity \nproduction that is among the world\u2019s costliest. Since Cambodia has limited indigenous energy sources that \nhave been explored so far, it relies primarily on expensive diesel generation. The lack of adequate and \naffordable electricity supply is identified as one of the main constraints on economic growth. Given the \nimportant role of electricity in providing power for economic growth, this constraint, if not removed, will \nsignificantly limit economic growth and hinder the country\u2019s ability to attract investments and economic \nactivities. \nDespite its weak infrastructure, Cambodia has started its process of rehabilitation with support from \ndevelopment partners. Power demand has increased significantly, with an annual growth rate of 12% on \naverage from 2000 to 2004. Increasing access to electricity, especially in provincial and rural areas, is a \nkey factor in the development of those areas. The Government\u2019s aggressive plan for infrastructure \ndevelopment gives priority to national power grid expansion in underserved areas. Given that the power \nsector plays a key role in economic growth and social development, Asian Development Bank\u2019s approach \nis to help the Government achieve its development objective.  \nSihanoukville, Cambodia\u2019s only deep-water port, is a fast-growing city with major ongoing projects to \nexpand the port facilities. The Government is developing Sihanoukville as an export processing zone and \nexpanding its international tourist industry. But currently there is no grid connection between Sihanoukville \nand the national main grid. The proposed Project will extend the transmission line from Kampot to \nSihanoukville.  The  extension  of  the  transmission  line  to  Sihanoukville will  promote  the  provision  of \nsustainable and reliable electricity supply at affordable prices to industrial, commercial, and residential \nconsumers in Sihanoukville and vicinity areas along the transmission corridor.  \nA reliable supply of electricity is important for economic growth and poverty reduction. Electricity supply \npromotes alternative sources of income that makes households less likely to fall below the poverty line. \nAccess  to  electricity  has  expenditure-reducing  effects,  which  are  particularly  important  for  poor \nhouseholds. Reduced expenditure on electricity allows households to spend more on food, education, and \nhealth services.  \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project is classified as a general intervention; therefore, according to the revised poverty guidelines, \nno poverty analysis is required. The resettlement plan (RP) includes measures for the affected people. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nConsultations regarding land acquisition and resettlement issues were undertaken with key government \nofficials and the affected people. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes     No \n \nThere is a strategy for further disclosure of the RP to affected people, who will be consulted and will \nparticipate in RP updating and implementation and monitoring. To increase the participation of various \nstakeholders, the Project includes capacity-building training for the affected people, commune leaders, \nand relevant government department and implementing agencies. Access to information and increased \nknowledge through capacity-building training would enable the affected households and commune leaders \nto participate effectively in consultations preceding resettlement activities and in compensation planning. \nThe gender sensitization training would increase awareness among the implementing agencies of the \nneed to create opportunities for participation among men and women from the affected households, as \nwell as men and women commune leaders, in resettlement and livelihood activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nRP  preparation,  updating,  and  implementation  will  pay  special  attention  to  (i)  the  role  of  women\u2019s \neconomic activities in restoring living standards; (ii) access to credit and agricultural extension for women, \nethnic minorities, and poor households; (iii) joint registration of any land-use rights in the names of both \nhusband  and  wife  where  households  are  allocated  alternative  agricultural  or  residential  land; \n(iv) participation and consultation strategies that encourage the involvement of women, ethnic minorities, \nand poor households in resettlement planning and implementation; (v) complaints and grievances lodged \nby women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; and (vi) collection of data disaggregated by gender \nand ethnic minority to support resettlement planning and monitoring.  \n \nThere is increased risk of HIV/AIDS to the project communities because of the influx of construction \nworkers. An HIV/AIDS awareness program for the communities will be developed and implemented during \nproject implementation Construction contracts will include a budgeted line item requiring contractors to \nprovide awareness and prevention programs for their workers. \n \nGender strategy: \n \n(i)  At the start of the Project, a capacity-building training program will be designed for the women \nvillage leaders from the affected communes. The participants will also include male commune \nleaders and representatives of mass organizations. The awareness and leadership skills training \nwill enhance women\u2019s participation at the commune level in resettlement-related discussions.  \n(ii)  The provincial and district resettlement working groups will include women representing the \ninterests of women and female-headed affected households. At the commune level, specific \nresettlement committees will be formed to participate in RP planning and implementation. \nSpecific strategies will be developed to encourage women and poor households to participate in \nresettlement planning and implementation and monitoring. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \n(iii)  During the Detailed Measurement Survey, men and women from the affected households will \nparticipate in the discussion of inventory and detailed measurement of losses. At the village, \nhamlet, and commune discussions for the preparation and implementation of the RPs, separate \nmeetings  will  be  held  with  the  women  from  the  affected  households  and  female-headed \nhouseholds to determine (a) the impact on the productive land and loss of other productive \nassets  and  income,  (b)  problems  related  to  relocation  of  houses,  and  (c)  the  additional \nmeasures or specific assistance required to address the needs of the households headed by \nwomen and women from the affected households. \n(iv)  Resettlement working groups and commune leaders will consult separately with the households \nheaded by women and women from households severely affected by displacement and those \naffected by the loss of 10% or more of productive assets to identify the assistance required in \nterms of selection of sites for productive land, extension services, training, and capital support to \nrestore their livelihood. \n(v)  Specific attention will be paid to (a) restoring the economic activities of the women affected by \nthe loss of productive trees and garden land; (b) providing them with access to agricultural \nextension assistance, training, and financial services; and (c) establishing links with a marketing \nfacility and relevant technical assistance, as required. \n(vi)  The RP will include joint registration of land-use rights in the names of both husband and wife in \ninstances where households are allocated alternative agriculture or residential land. \n(vii)  Attention will be paid to complaints and grievances made by women and poor households. \n(viii)  The  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  awareness  campaign  will  involve  the  women,  youth,  health \nworkers, and women community leaders. \n(ix)  Women,  as  well  as  men  from  severely  affected  poor  households,  will  be  prioritized  for \nemployment-related civil works for the transmission lines and substations. \n(x)  According to the Labor Code (1997) all employment for the Project will respect government \ncommitments to gender equity including (a) employment targets for women, (b) prohibitions \nagainst the use of child labor or trafficked labor, (c) nondiscrimination against the employment of \nqualified women, and (d) nondiscrimination in the payment of wages or benefits to men and \nwomen for work of equal value. \n(xi)  Monitoring indicators disaggregated by gender and ethnic group will be developed for the \nmanagement information system. \n(xii)  Gender sensitization training will be held for relevant staff from Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge and \nInter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee,  members  of  the  provincial,  district  resettlement \nworking groups, commune leaders, and the independent monitoring agency. \n(xiii)  A  national  consultant  on  gender  and  development  will  provide  consulting  assistance  in \ndeveloping the gender strategy into an implementation plan. Capacity-building training will \ninclude men and women commune leaders, men and women leaders from the AP households, \nand district-level women officials from the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs. The capacity-building \ntraining will focus on (a) information on effective consultation, RP activities, compensation, and \nlivelihood activities, to increase knowledge about resettlement planning, compensation, and \nimplementation; (b) information and linkages with poverty and rural development programs \nsupported by funding agencies, government, and nongovernment organizations, so that the \naffected people can get access to these programs; and (c) impact of the project on livelihood \nfrom productive trees. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
