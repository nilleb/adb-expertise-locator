THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The Proposal \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will help strengthen Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Southeast Asia developing member countries\u2019 (DMCs) institutional capacity and \npractices on project readiness, procurement, and financial management. The TA is included in \nthe Country Operations Business Plans for Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.1 The TA facility is directly linked to \nStrategy 2030 key operational priority of ADB, which calls for strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity of DMCs.2 The list of programs and projects to be supported under the \nproposed TA Facility is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The basic level of support for project-based procurement and financial management to \nDMCs is normally provided under a TA attached to a project. Client feedback on programs carried \nout under prior TA projects suggests that the level of awareness on ADB\u2019s operational procedures \nhas increased but knowledge and skills gaps remain. Further, there is increasing demand from \nthe  project  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for  additional  support  and  training  on \nprocurement and financial management not only at the project level, but also at the sectoral level \nto enhance institutional skills and experience in these specialized areas. \n \n3.  Under the proposed TA facility, ADB will bring together expertise and knowledge to \nstrategically coordinate the design and delivery of more cohesive capacity building programs. \nProgram  principles  and  tools  will  be  embedded  in  practice  and  institutionalized  to  ensure \nreplicability and sustainability. The TA facility will build on ADB\u2019s experience in supporting capacity \ndevelopment through ongoing TA projects administered by the Southeast Asia Department \n(SERD) and Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department (PPFD).3 It will not \nduplicate ongoing support and will instead complement the efforts of these TA projects in \nstrengthening  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  in  Southeast  Asia  DMCs. \nFurthermore, the TA facility will be flexible in supporting emerging needs in Southeast Asia, while \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2019.

Challenges and Opportunities \n \n4.  As of 30 November 2019, ADB\u2019s portfolio in Southeast Asia had 255 active loan and grant \nprojects for a net amount of $16.4 billion. The performance of the portfolio has been declining, \nand it is below ADB average.4 More projects encountered implementation delays leading to \nproject extensions. In 2018, the average period of extension was 2.1 years, and the average age \nof projects based on the year of loan signing increased from 3.4 years in 2017 to 3.7 years in \n2018. The complexity of the projects and the lack of understanding and familiarity of executing \nand implementing agency staff with ADB\u2019s project implementation requirements and procedures \ncontributed the most to these problems. \n \n5.  Project implementation challenges are largely due to (i) regulatory or business practice \nhurdles that impede project readiness; (ii) detailed designs being prepared only after project \napproval; (iii) weak capacity of project executing and implementing agencies, including lack of \nunderstanding and limited skills and experience in procurement and financial management; (iv) \nlimited exposure of project executing and implementing agencies to international standards and \nbest practices; and (v) inadequately prepared and designed project. \n \n6.  Project Readiness. To deliver ADB assistance on time and more effectively, projects \nmust be properly designed to support DMCs\u2019 needs with due consideration and application of \nADB\u2019s  policies  and guidelines.  Especially  for countries  where  there are  barriers  to  project \nreadiness financing, procurement can only start after designs are finalized which may be more \nthan a year after approval. Gathering and reflecting lessons from earlier project deficiencies and \nsuccesses, the TA facility will promote enhancements on project readiness by improving capacity \nof  and  providing  support  to  project  executing  and  implementing  agencies  during  project \nprocessing. \n \n7.  Procurement. Other reasons for project implementation delays include slow procurement \nand weak implementation capacity in handling procurement processes and complex contracts. \nOften, the project executing and implementing agencies do not have the capacity to prepare \nquality bid documents and reports that meet ADB\u2019s standards, resulting in resubmissions and \ndelays  to  the  procurement  cycle.  Furthermore,  new  features  of  ADB\u2019s  New  Procurement \nFramework (NPF) such as strategic procurement planning, contract management, and value-for-\nmoney approach need to be better understood. The TA facility will support the rollout of the NPF \nand its implementation by strengthening the implementation capacities of Southeast Asia DMCs \nand providing timely support to projects covered under the new framework.  \n \n8.  As a major development partner embracing sustainable and inclusive development, ADB \nassists DMCs to undertake critical reforms to build country systems in applying advanced \ntechnology,  reducing  life-cycle  costs,  assuring  the  financial  viability  of  investments,  and \nmaintaining infrastructure assets. By strengthening local capacity in these areas, DMCs will \nimprove their governance leading to sustainable investments, including those financed by ADB. \nADB has committed to partner with other development agencies of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development and multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, to \npromote and support the application of Method for Assessing Procurement Systems (MAPS) in \nDMCs. MAPS is an internationally recognized systematic tool reflective of leading international \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2018. 2018 Annual Evaluation Review. Manila. \n ", "  3 \nprocurement  practices  that  serves  as  a  guide  towards  sustainable  and  inclusive  public \nprocurement reform. The broad development objective of MAPS is to support governments to \nfurther improve the performance of the public procurement system, and yield optimal results in \nthe use of public funds and delivery of services to the citizenry, while maintaining high standards \nof integrity. \n \n9.  Financial Management. Weak financial management systems hamper the realization of \nDMCs\u2019 development goals. Delayed, incomplete, and/or poor-quality financial reports are some \nof  the  critical  and  ongoing  issues  identified  during  the  review  of  audited  project  financial \nstatements (APFS). As of  September 2018, 39% of APFS in Southeast Asia DMCs  were \nsubmitted late, while in the comparative period in 2019, the late submissions increased to 51%.5 \nAs part of financial management strengthening and upholding of ADB\u2019s fiduciary responsibility, \nan APFS is assessed and concluded as acceptable when the APFS is timely received from project \nexecuting and implementing agencies and follows the acceptable financial reporting standards. \nOut of 49% (109 APFS) received on-time as of September 2019, only 70% (76 APFS) were \nconcluded as acceptable (footnote 6). The capacity to prepare and produce financial reports \nvaries among DMCs. The APFSs vary greatly in form, content, and audit opinions. Preparing \ncomprehensive, reliable and relevant financial reports enhances the usefulness of financial \ninformation for monitoring and decision-making and improves transparency and accountability of \npublic and donor funds. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Project readiness, procurement, and financial management capacity of \nDMCs strengthened. The TA facility will provide (i) relevant seminars, training, and workshops \nto the DMCs; (ii) practical solutions to identified procurement and financial management issues \non an institutional level to remove hurdles; and (iii) hands-on support to project executing and \nimplementing agencies at key stages of project implementation including  procurement and \nfinancial management activities, with initial focus on at-risk projects. This output, which will \ncomplement other broader efforts, is expected to increase procurement-ready projects and \nimprove procurement timelines and financial management compliance.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Country procurement and financial management assessments prepared. \nThe TA facility will provide the following: \n \n(i)  Support the scoping and implementation of a government-led systematic country \nprocurement assessments using MAPS, and analysis of the results to develop long \nterm  strategic  roadmap  to  achieve  the  governments\u2019  public  procurement \ndevelopment agenda.6 The TA facility consultant will assist in the following aspects \nof MAPS assessments: (a) identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the public \nprocurement system and their relative importance and major risks; (b) identifying \nany substantial gaps that impede the efficient use of public funds; (c) making \nappropriate recommendations to address the identified gaps; (d) elaborate a \nstrategy and reform action plan to improve procurement performance to deliver \nbetter  economic  and  social  benefits;  and  (e)  early  engagement  of  other \ndevelopment partners in the selected DMCs in the MAPS process.  \n \n                                                \n5 ADB (Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department). 2019. Q3 2018 Operations Review. 19    \nOctober (internal).  \n6  It is expected that the proposed TRTA facility will support two MAPS assessments. \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Strengthen  country  financial  management  by  performing  gap  assessments, \ndetermining  financial  management  deficiencies  at  the  institutional  level,  and \nsupporting development of a long-term road map outlining short-, medium- and \nlong-term action plan and the associated areas of support required, to be used for \ncoordination of assistance efforts by ADB, World Bank and other development \npartners.  \n \n12.  The assessments will help ADB to strategically plan and design effective procurement and \nfinancial management arrangements for future projects to improve project performance. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,073,000 from TASF-6 and $427,000 from TASF-\nother sources). The TA facility may be replenished as funds are required or cofinancing from trust \nfunds become available. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The governments were informed that approval of the TA facility does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA facility will be implemented over a period of 3 years in Southeast Asian DMCs.7 \nADB will administer the TA facility. Overall TA facility coordination will be conducted by the Office \nof the Director General, SERD supported by the PPFD, in close collaboration with resident \nmissions in SERD.  \n \n16.
