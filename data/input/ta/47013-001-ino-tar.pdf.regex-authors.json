During the preparation of the second phase of the policy-led European Union (EU) \nsector budget support, the EU and the Government of Indonesia recommended that \u20ac37.3 \nmillion for additional technical assistance (TA) for the Minimum Service Standards Capacity \nDevelopment Program be provided, in particular to address disparities in provincial and district \neducation performance.1 The TA will contribute to (i) strengthening the capacity of the Ministry \nof Education and Culture (MOEC) and the administrations in selected districts for planning, \nbudgeting, and managing education services in accordance with basic education minimum \nservice standards (MSSs);2 and (ii) promoting advocacy for education MSSs. The EU and the \ngovernment have invited the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to manage the new TA resources \non behalf of the government. \n \n2.  The TA will include three outputs: (i) improved district education administration and \nschool management capacity to achieve the education MSSs; (ii) enhanced awareness of the \neducation MSSs by the general public and education services decision-makers; (iii) Effective \nintegration  of  MSSs  into  related  education  sector  functions  and  policies.3 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s decentralized education system. Indonesia's education system is one of \nthe world\u2019s largest, with about 300,000 schools, over 66 million students, and about 3.3 million \nteachers.  There  are  three  levels  of  formal  education\u2014primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary\u2014\nprovided  by  public  and  private  schools  under  the  MOEC  and  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs \n(MORA). The education system under MOEC is decentralized, while MORA has maintained \noversight  of  Islamic  public  and  private  schools  (madrasahs). 4 Under  the Law on \nNational Education System (No.20/2003),5 madrasahs are integral part of the national education \nsystem, following the national curriculum and education standards set by the government. \nIndonesia\u2019s highly decentralized system of government was implemented in 2001; under the \nsystem, district governments have been given increasing responsibility for public education. \nPolicy, strategy, and standard setting are concentrated in the central government, while the 33 \n                                                 \n1 The EU and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) contribute jointly to the Education Sector \nSupport Program. The program commenced in 2010 and consists of (i) two-phase, policy-led EU sector budget \nsupport with agreed arrangements for results-led grant disbursement; (ii) earmarked policy and program-led \nAusAID sector development grant support consisting of a school infrastructure program, a nationwide school- and \ndistrict-level management and leadership development program, and a program to support madrasah education; \nand (iii) a jointly financed  research and capacity development facility\u2014the Education Sector Analytical and \nCapacity Development Partnership, which is managed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Government of \nAustralia will contribute approximately A$500 million over 2010\u20132015, with indicative annual disbursements of \naround A$100 million; the EU earmarked \u20ac201 million over 2010\u20132012 with additional funding of \u20ac119 over 2013\u2013\n2015. This TA is part of the \u20ac119 million that has been earmarked for the second Education Sector Support \nProgram (ESSP) phase under Financing Agreement No. DCI/ASIE/2011/023-42, signed on December 2012. \n2  Under the TA to Indonesia for the Basic Education Sector Capacity Support Program, ADB provided assistance to \nthe government to develop MSSs. The TA was fully financed by the EU. The cooperation agreement between the \nEU and ADB was signed in December 2007 for \u20ac4.2 million. The TA was successfully completed on 31 December \n2010.   \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 March 2013.  \n4  Currently, there are about 45,000 madrasahs registered under MORA, of which 90% are private.  \n5  World Bank. World Bank and Education in Indonesia. \nhttp://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/0,,contentMDK:23187196~p\nagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:226301,00.html (accessed 11 March 2013). \n ", "2   \nprovinces are responsible for oversight, support and monitoring, and evaluation of over 500 \ndistrict or city administrations. The latter are ultimately responsible for providing basic education, \nincluding  early  childhood,  primary,  and  junior  secondary  education  services.  MORA\u2019s \nresponsibilities  remain  comparatively  centralized,  with  authority  delegated  to  provincial \nauthorities and district- and city-level MORA offices.  \n \n4.  Education sector reform progress. In general, the Indonesian education sector has \nmade sound progress against education sector targets to improve access to and the quality of \neducation  services,  achieve  the  education-related  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and \ncontribute to the wider government priorities of increasing international competitiveness and \npromoting inclusive socioeconomic growth through investment in human capital. Indonesia\u2019s \nConstitution requires that 20% of national and subnational public expenditure per year be \ndirected to education. Since 2009, the government has met and surpassed the 20% target. \nEconomic growth projections and the accompanying sector budget projections suggest that the \ncurrent level of support for education will continue and may even increase. Based on past \nperformance  and  current  economic  trends,  education  sector  reforms  appear  feasible, \nachievable, and appropriate.  \n \n5.  Education  sector  disparities.  The  sound  progress  at  the  national  level  masks \nsignificant disparities in education services at the district and city level, and additional effort is \nrequired to ensure that improved performance in education is realized throughout Indonesia. \nThe  government  has  recognized  that  there is  inequity  in  basic  education service  delivery; \nalthough participation in basic education has increased considerably in recent years, with near \nuniversal enrolment in primary education, persistent geographical inequities in access to junior \nsecondary education remain. There are significant differences in the provision of key inputs \nrelated to education quality, both regionally and between cities and districts. In particular, the \neastern region lags behind on almost all key aspects related to MSSs, including infrastructure, \nprovision of teachers, teacher qualifications, teaching and learning materials, supervision, and \nhours of instruction. In response, the government is placing a high priority on improving the \nequity  of  basic  education  service  delivery  through  targeted  programs  that  include  school \noperational funding, teacher upgrading, principal and supervisor capacity development, new \nschool  construction,  and  school  rehabilitation.  Other  key  priorities  related  to  strengthening \ngovernance systems include: (i) phased introduction of program-based budgeting approaches to \nstrengthen  the  public  service  planning  and  budgeting  systems;  (ii)  development  and \nestablishment  of  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  at  each  administrative  level;  (iii) \nimproved  financial  and  asset  management  procedures  at  all  levels;  (iv)  strengthened \naccountability and internal control systems; (v) strengthened human resources management \nand performance assessment systems; and (vi) establishment of a framework for introducing \nperformance-based remuneration systems. These initiatives are accompanied by a strong focus \non strengthening local-level capacity, with an emphasis on establishing effective community \nparticipation in school planning, management, and oversight of education performance.  \n \n6.  Importance  of  achieving  minimum  service  standards.  To  address  disparities  in \neducation quality and service delivery at the local level, the government emphasizes the need to \nachieve the education MSSs.6 The MSSs are viewed as necessary for supporting more effective \n                                                 \n6  Minimum service standards (MSSs) are a government-wide initiative, under the central auspice of MOHA, with line \nministries such as education assigned the responsibility of developing MSSs appropriate to their sector. With TA \nsupport from the EU and ADB (footnote 2), MOEC and MORA have defined MSSs which were formally endorsed \nby the government in 2010 through the Ministerial Regulation 15/2010. The MSSs focus on a relatively small \nnumber of school- and districts or cities-level inputs and process indicators that provide the minimum essential \n ", "  3 \nand efficient subnational planning and prioritization processes, in order to improve education \nperformance, and as a critical policy tool for strengthening governance, accountability, and \nequity-based provision of these services. Background information on education MSSs, including \na  discussion  on  lessons  from  MSSs  implementation  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  2;  the \nappendix also contains lessons from the EU-financed Basic Education Sector Capacity Support \nProgram (footnote 2) that are relevant to the design of this project.7 MOEC and MORA currently \nprovide support for achievement of the education MSSs, but many weaker districts or cities will \nneed supplementary assistance. Accordingly, the TA will provide capacity building support to \n110 poorly performing districts or cities, in an effort to create a critical mass of districts or cities \nto demonstrate the benefits of using MSSs as an effective planning and management tool to \naddress disparities, improve the efficiency of resource allocation, and strengthen accountability \narrangements with the intention of improving overall education service delivery. The districts or \ncities represent over 20% of all districts or cities in Indonesia, and achieving success in these \nareas  will  provide  valuable  evidence  that  can  inform  further  replication  of  MSSs  across \nIndonesia. Through the support of the nationwide education MSSs advocacy component, these \ngains can be widely publicized as examples of best practice and overall success in establishing \neducation  MSSs,  even  under  difficult  circumstances.  Publicizing  successful  MSSs \nachievements and highlighting the large number of districts or cities effectively implementing \neducation MSSs will send a strong message that these successes are systemic rather than \nisolated, and can be achieved nationwide. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  will  be  a  strengthened  education  system,  which  will  contribute  to  the \nimplementation of Indonesia's medium-term development policies for poverty reduction and \nimproved regional and global economic competitiveness. The outcome will be reduced regional \ndisparities in the provision of education services.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will include three outputs: \n \n(i)  Improved district education administration and school management capacity to \nachieve the education MSSs. \n                                                                                                                                                          \nconditions for learning. The districts or cities level MSSs include 14 indicators, divided over four clusters: access \nand infrastructure (4 indicators); provision of adequate numbers of teachers (2); qualifications of teachers (6); and \ndistrict quality assurance and management (2). The school-level MSSs include 3 clusters of 13 indicators: provision \nof resources for learning (4); teaching process (5); and school quality assurance and management (4). \n7 Specific lessons from the Basic Education Sector Capacity Support Program that are relevant to the design of the \nMSSs Capacity Development Program are: (i) more effective promotion of Ministerial Regulation 15/2010 is \nneeded; (ii) more explicit guidelines for interviewers and data collectors in assessing MSSs are needed; (iii) it is \nimportant that sustained capacity development be provided for MSSs at the districts or cities level; (iv) the share of \nlocal budget allocated for education is a key indicator of local-level relevance and commitment in achieving the \nMSSs for education; (v) education officials and school personnel need to understand their roles and responsibilities \nwith respect to MSSs; (vi) the timing of MSSs assessment and planning must be aligned with the school year and \nthe annual planning and budgeting cycles for schools and districts or cities; (vii) the MSSs must be integrated with \nannual school census and data collection processes; (viii) leadership and commitment  by the local government is \nof critical importance; (ix) good coordination between the district education office and the local office of MORA is \nessential; and (x) a single data set and agreed data collection processes between all users and stakeholders must \nbe developed to ensure trust and cooperation.  \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Enhanced  awareness  of  the  education  MSSs  by  the  general  public  and \neducation services decision-makers. \n(iii)  Effective integration of MSSs into related education sector functions and policies. \n \n9.  Output  1:  Improved  district  education  administration  and  school  management \ncapacity to achieve the education minimum service standards. A total of 110 pre-selected \ndistricts will receive district grants of \u20ac200,000 to strengthen district education administration \nand school management capacity in planning, budgeting, and managing education services to \nachieve the MSSs. This support is not intended to provide sufficient resources for the districts to \nattain the MSSs in all their schools, but is intended to act as a stimulus to facilitate a higher level \nof commitment to accomplishment of the MSSs among key decision makers and education \nofficials. The indicative list of districts and the selection criteria are in Supplementary Appendix \n3.8 \n \n10.   To  ensure  commitment  from  the  pre-selected  districts,  the  executing  agency\u2014the \nMOEC  Directorate  General  for  Basic  Education  (DGBE)\u2014with  the  support  of  the  district \nadvisory teams, will liaise with the respective local governments to verify their commitment to \nparticipate in the project. To be eligible for district grant support, the respective head of each \ndistricts  or  cities\u2014the  bupati  (regent)  or  walikota  (mayor)\u2014will  sign  a  memorandum  of \nagreement with DGBE within the first 4 months of project implementation confirming their intent \nto  be  actively  engaged  in  the  project,  and  specifying  counterpart  officers  and  indicative \nresources to be provided to facilitate MSSs activities.  \n \n11.  At the start of the project, DGBE, with support of the MSSs technical advisors,9 will \nprepare  MSSs  socialization  materials  based  on  existing  materials  for  district  capacity \ndevelopment.10 Subsequently, DGBE, with support of the district advisory teams and in close \ncooperation with MORA and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), 11 will facilitate awareness \nprograms in all project districts to underline the importance of MSSs and clarify the scope of the \nMSSs Capacity Development Program, including procedures to use grant funding. To generate \nsynergies and benefit from lessons, the MSSs technical advisors and the district advisory teams \nwill assist DGBE to review ongoing MSSs related capacity development projects and discuss \nstrategies for complementarities with provincial and district BAPPEDAs, MOHA, and MORA.  \n \n12.  The TA will include resources to conduct comprehensive MSSs status quo assessments \nin the project districts that will inform key local decision makers and assist them in prioritizing \nresources to achieve the MSSs. With the support of the district advisory teams, all project \ndistricts will carry out MSSs status quo assessments in the second quarter of 2013 to (i) \ndetermine  the  current  status  of  MSSs  achievement  at  schools,  madrasahs,  and  district \nadministrations,  and  identify  the  MSSs  gap;12 and  (ii)  evaluate  districts  or  cities  capacity. \nStandardized templates for the MSSs status assessment will help in building a sound MSSs \nbaseline, which will be used as a benchmark to monitor progress in achieving MSSs. District \n                                                 \n8   The DGBE will confirm the final selection of districts prior to TA implementation. \n9   MSSs technical advisors will consist of an international and two national consultants to be recruited under the TA. \n10 The socialization strategy will particularly consider materials developed and/or used by MOEC, MORA, MOHA, the \nDecentralized Basic Education project, the Basic Education Capacity\u2013Trust Fund, the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF), and AusAID. \n11 District advisory teams will consist of 3\u20135 consultants in each province to be recruited under the TA. \n12 Funds to conduct the MSSs status quo assessments in the 110 project districts will be provided through the district \nadvisory teams.  ", "  5 \nMSSs  progress  reports  will  form  the  basis  for  the  establishment  of  a  nationwide  MSSs \nmonitoring system, to be managed by DGBE in close cooperation with MORA.  \n \n13.  Based on the results of the 2013 MSSs status quo assessments, the project districts will \nprepare  overall  MSSs  plans,  which  will  identify  the  strategies  and  resources  needed  to \naccelerate  MSSs  achievement  and  develop  evidence-based,  efficient  planning  methods  to \nincorporate into the annual district development plans and budgets the strategies and resources \nneeded to reach the MSSs. The plans will also include specific proposals to promote MSSs \nachievement that are to be financed by the district grants provided under the TA. The district \nadvisory teams will support the development of the MSSs plans and specific grant proposals to \nbe financed by the TA, and will help to ensure that MSSs plans are formally incorporated in the \nannual district development plans, approved by local parliaments, and included in the 2015 \nand/or 2016 district DIPA (annual budgets). To evaluate the effectiveness of the district grants \ntowards achieving MSSs, all project districts will conduct an MSSs survey to assess progress by \nthe end of 2015. \n \n14.  Detailed project guidelines and manuals describing the eligibility criteria and procedures \nto  use  grant  funds  will  be  developed  and  approved  at  the  beginning  of  the  project.  The \nproposals for district grants will be reviewed by DGBE with the assistance of the MSSs technical \nadvisors and the operation management team (OMT). After DGBE approval, district grants will \nbe awarded through the district or city\u2019s DIPA for 2014 and 2015. The district advisory teams will \nassist in the implementation of activities and will monitor and report on the grant expenditures. \nThe district grants will be used to finance the following broad categories of activities: \n(i)  MSSs  progress  assessment:  support  for  data  collection,  data  analysis  and \nsynthesis, and  improving MSSs monitoring at  the district level;  \n(ii)  developing human resource capacity for analysis and strategic planning of the \ndistrict  education  office,  MORA  district  office,  BAPPEDA,  and  other  offices \nworking on MSSs; and for enhancing school MSSs supervision and monitoring;  \n(iii)  supporting working groups (of teachers, principals, and supervisors) in fostering \ngreater understanding of the education MSSs and in strengthening professional \npractice toward achievement of MSSs requirements;  \n(iv)  supporting  partnerships  between  schools,  their  communities  and  the  local \ngovernment  structures,  specifically  in  support  of  establishing  stronger \naccountability procedures in respect to the education MSSs;  \n(v)  supporting  MSSs advocacy at the district, sub-district, city and school levels; \n(vi)  facilitating  the  continued  engagement  and  commitment  of  districts  or  cities \ndecision makers toward the achievement of the education MSSs in their districts \nor cities through school or community visits and workshops; and \n(vii)  strengthening capacity of the districts or cities to monitor and assess progress \ntowards the education MSSs in all schools.  \n \n15.  In summary, the key achievements under this output will include the following:  \n(i)  MSSs  status  quo  reports  for  each  project  district  prepared  prior  to  the \ninterventions;  \n(ii)  MSSs district plans prepared describing strategies and resources required to \nachieve the MSSs, including strategies for enhanced community engagement; \n(iii)  proposals for district grants are formulated, approved, and implemented; \n(iv)  strategies and resources required to reach the MSSs are incorporated in the \nannual district development plans and budgets and reflected in district education \nplans by 2015; and \n ", "6   \n(v)  MSSs  monitoring  systems  are  established,  providing  regular  updated \ninformation on progress at school and district levels.  \n \n16.  Output 2: Enhanced awareness of education minimum service standards by the \ngeneral public and education services decision. The MSSs are intended to provide public \nservice recipients with a better understanding of the level of service to which they are entitled, \nenhance  accountability  of  service  delivery,  and  provide  government  decision  makers  and \neducation planners with a tool to improve efficiency in the distribution and use of education \nresources.  However,  the  general  public  and  many  local  government  officials  have  limited \nawareness of the MSSs. Consequently, MOEC, in consultation with MORA and MOHA, is \ndeveloping an MSSs community awareness program. This output will assist MOEC, MORA, and \nMOHA to deliver a multi-faceted advocacy and leadership strategy to support achievement of \nthe MSSs, with the objective of:  \n(i)  enhancing general public awareness  of MSSs and encouraging greater public \nparticipation  and  community  engagement  in  ensuring  schools  and  local \ngovernment are held accountable for achieving MSSs, and stimulating public \ndemand  and  advocacy  for  the  allocation  of  adequate  resources  toward  this \nimportant goal;  \n(ii)  enhancing  awareness  of  the  education  MSSs  among  key  stakeholders  who \ninfluence  education  policy  and  service  delivery  at  both  the  national  and \nsubnational levels; and \n(iii)  publicizing  progress  towards  education  MSSs  in  project  districts  to  generate \nnational interest and support for progress towards education MSSs in all schools \nand districts or cities.  \n \n17.  Nationwide publicity of the successful progress made in achieving the education MSSs \nin project districts should stimulate increased public pressure for achieving the education MSSs \nthroughout Indonesia. It will also provide key messages and examples of best practices for \nschool  and  districts  or  cities  education  planners  and  decision  makers,  and  will  help  build \nnational momentum for the establishment of MSSs. An established public relations firm will be \nrecruited to prepare and implement the advocacy campaign. Indicative terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n18.  Output 3: Effective integration of minimum service standards in related education \nsector functions and policies. To extend support for accelerating achievement of the MSSs \nnationwide  and  to  streamline  district-level  lessons,  the  TA  will  assist  DGBE  in  developing \nstrategies for effective integration of education MSSs into related education sector functions and \npolicies,  such  as  school  accreditation  schemes,  overall  school  performance  assessment \nprograms,  professional  development  programs  for  staff,  and  other  strategic  functions  and \npolicies. DGBE will closely coordinate their efforts with MORA and MOHA to ensure that the \nMSSs  will  be  integrated  into  education  functions  under  the  responsibility  of  MORA  (i.e., \nmadrasah accreditation scheme and madrasah supervision), and that MSSs achievements at \nmadrasahs  will  be  incorporated  in  the  overall  MSSs  monitoring  system.  A  team  of  MSSs \ntechnical advisors will help DGBE establish the overall MSSs monitoring system, which will be \nbased on MSSs reports generated by the districts. DGBE will set up a structure to regularly \ncollect and analyze district MSSs-related information, and prepare and publish MSSs progress \nreports  summarizing  achievements  and  regional  challenges  towards  the  achievement  of \nnationwide MSSs. To ensure uniform MSSs assessments across the 110 project districts, the \nMSSs technical advisors will guide the district advisory teams in the use of standardized formats, ", "  7 \nthereby ensuring the information gathered can be aggregated into the national MSSs monitoring \nsystem. \n \n19.  To promote MSSs awareness throughout the education system, the technical advisors \nwill assist DGBE to liaise with provinces to help in integrating MSSs plans into provincial \neducation plans, and reviewing options to mobilize provincial resources to support schools, \nmadrasahs, and district administrations. This will help accelerate the achievement of the MSSs. \nThe MSSs technical advisors will facilitate a collaborative and participatory process ensuring \nhigh-level consultations with all major stakeholders at the central, province, and district levels. \nBased on lessons from districts and monitoring reports, the TA will assist DGBE to incorporate \nMSSs strategies in the next education strategic plan. MSSs technical advisors will help DGBE to: \n(i)  prepare  the  terms  of  reference  for  supplementary  surveys  to  be  conducted  under  the \nAnalytical and Capacity Development Partnership,13 (ii) assess overall progress, (iii) determine \nadditional resource requirements, (iv) review capacity building needs, and (v) prepare capacity \nstrengthening plans.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n20.   The TA is estimated to cost $47.03 million (\u20ac37.03 million), of which $47.03 million \n(\u20ac37.3 million) will be financed on a grant basis by the European Union.  The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, workshop facilitation, remuneration \nand per diem for counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n21.      The TA will be implemented over 3 years, and is expected to commence in April 2013 \nand end in March 2016. The executing agency is the DGBE of MOEC. The DGBE director \ngeneral will be the director of the MSSs Capacity Development Program. The director will \nappoint a manager from within DGBE to facilitate and supervise the implementation of activities. \nA deputy manager will be assigned to assist the manager in implementing day-to-day work. The \nproject manager will lead a project implementing unit (PIU), which will be supported by four \nteams of consultants. The PIU will be adequately staffed to undertake (i) project management, \n(ii) financial management responsibilities, and (iii) fiduciary responsibilities. The PIU will be \nresponsible for validating and verifying all payment claims, in compliance with ADB's policies \nand procedures. The PIU will maintain the required financial systems and controls to record all \nfinancial transactions under the TA and prepare the TA annual project accounts. The manager \nwill  organize  and  execute  internal  reviews  and  the  final  evaluation,  facilitate  visibility \nrequirements of project activities, and ensure regular liaisons with MOHA, MORA, BAPPENAS, \nthe participating districts, and development partners, and particularly the EU. Annual work plans \nwill be formulated in cooperation with BAPPENAS, MORA, and MOHA through an iterative \nprocess of consultations and workshops.  \n \n22.  To support implementation of TA activities, three types of consultants at the national and \nthe district levels will be recruited by ADB: (i) an operational management team (OMT) and a \n                                                 \n13 The Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) is a facility to finance policy research and capacity \nplanning in the education sector. The ACDP is jointly financed by the EU and the AusAID under the overall ESSP, \nand is managed by the ADB. \n ", "8   \nteam comprising an international and a national MSSs technical advisor, who will be located at \nDGBE; (ii) MSSs district advisory teams; and (iii) an MSSs advocacy firm. \n \n23.  An MSSs technical oversight group (TOG) will be established, chaired by the director \ngeneral of DGBE, to provide supervision and strategic guidance for the project. The TOG will \napprove  annual  work  plans.  In  particular,  the  TOG  will  provide  guidance  for  planning, \nimplementing, and monitoring the MSSs advocacy strategy and promoting integration of MSSs \ninto education sector functions and policies, and inform the overall Education Sector Support \nProgram governance and oversight group. The TOG will meet at least twice a year. Membership \nof the TOG is described in Supplementary Appendix 4. \n \n24.  To support the implementation of project activities, an MSSs technical working group \n(TWG) will be established at DGBE to oversee implementation progress, review annual work \nplans, and monitor project implementation progress and effectiveness. The TWG will be chaired \nby  the  DGBE  secretary  (or  their  designated  representative)  and  will  meet  quarterly.  The \ncomposition of the TWG is provided in Supplementary Appendix 4. The TWG will facilitate \nregular technical dialogue with designated EU and ADB representatives and other development \npartners. The TWG will also identify strategic opportunities at the provincial and district level to \npromote MSSs awareness, and mobilize local resources with a particular focus on the poorest \ndistricts or cities. Meetings of the TOG and TWG will be prepared and facilitated with the help of \nthe OMT. \n \n25.  In the project districts, the Dinas Pendidikan (district education office) will establish \nproject implementation units, which will liaise with all major stakeholders (e.g., the BAPPEDA, \nthe district finance office, the bupati office, and the local parliament) to ensure that (i) the district \ngrant proposal is developed through a consultative process and is included in the DIPA system, \n(ii) subsequent activities are implemented as agreed, and (iii) MSSs strategies are integrated in \nrelevant policies and annual district development plans. \n \n26.  ADB will be responsible for managing and administering the TA. ADB will ensure that the \ninputs are managed effectively and efficiently. Recruitment of consultants will be in accordance \nwith ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and any \nprocurement will be in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).14 Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with  ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), except the district \ngrants that will be disbursed through an imprest account established at the Bank Indonesia by \nthe Ministry of Finance.  Advance will be provided based on 3 months estimated expenditures. \nThe ADB\u2019s Statement of Expenditure procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of \nthe imprest account (with a $15,000 ceiling per individual payment).15 The fund channeling \nmechanism is in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n \n27.  EU procurement guidelines forbid discrimination in procurement when engaging legal \npersons and firms, and procuring goods and services from persons and entities established in \nEU-recognized official countries, EU member states, and developing countries as specified by \nthe Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \n                                                 \n14 About 60-80 person-months of international consultant inputs, and 1,900 person-months national consultant inputs \nwill be recruited under the TA. \n15 District grants will be disbursed through an imprest account at the Bank Indonesia as governed by ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). ", "  9 \nDevelopment.16 Under the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership, the ADB Board of \nDirectors had approved allowing the procurement of eligible goods and services from countries \nthat are not ADB members if they are entitled to supply them under EU regulations. As activities \nunder the new outputs will be fully financed by the EU, the same practice will apply. An \nindicative procurement plan is in Supplementary Appendix 5. \n \n28.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  workshop \nfacilitation, remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The \nspecific  work  plan  allocations  under  the  three  outputs  and  annual  budget  plans  will  be \ndetermined in the inception phase. \n \n29.  MOEC\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity to carry out the project is \nadequate, and it has successfully implemented numerous internationally funded projects since \n1980. DGBE has sufficient capacity and staffing to manage the project activities. The grants will \nbe transferred to the selected project districts or cities within the public financial management \nsystem,17 as described in Supplementary Appendix 1. With the help of consultants, DGBE will \nprepare draft guidelines and manuals for fund handling of the district grants, which will include \neligibility criteria for the use of district grants, and procedures for reimbursement, and reporting. \nThe draft guidelines and manuals will be reviewed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and ADB to \nensure that the technical requirements for proposal and grant awards are in line with the \ngovernment financial management system and ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. Upon review \nand endorsement by MOF and ADB, the DGBE will issue the guidelines and manuals to guide \nthe project district administrations in preparing grant proposals for \u20ac200,000 with the help of the \ndistrict advisory team. The proposals will be reviewed and approved by MOEC with the help of \nthe OMT. District grant proposals will include activity and disbursement plans for 2014 and 2015. \nThese annual plans will be endorsed by the local governments and will be formally included in \nthe DIPA. \n \n30.  Activities will be implemented in accordance with the approved annual plans and pre-\nfinanced by the district administrations from the overall annual district DIPA. For reimbursement, \nthe Dinas Pendidikan will prepare financial reports and payment requests with the support of the \ndistrict advisory teams, and submit these to DGBE. With the help of the OMT, DGBE will assess \nthe reports and documents from the project districts, verify the accuracy of the utilization of \nfunds and completeness of the documents, and advise the districts to improve or complete \nreports and payment requests in the case of any discrepancy. Upon DGBE\u2019s confirmation of the \ncompliance  of  the  reports  and  payment  request  documents,  MOF  will  facilitate  the \nreimbursement of the expenditures to the district treasurer\u2019s account. The districts are required \nto keep all receipts and reports of all activities financed with TA funds for audits conducted by \nthe Supreme Audit Institution of the Republic of Indonesia (BPK). In addition, ADB will arrange \nfor annual audits of the project by an independent auditor, acceptable to both ADB and EU. \nFunds  have  been  included  in  the  TA  budget  to  meet  the  audit  expenses.  During  the  TA \nimplementation, within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year, annual audit reports will be \nsubmitted, which will include audited reports on district grant disbursements.  \n \n                                                 \n16  Regulation (EU) No. 2110/2005 of the European Council and Parliament, 14 December 2005. \n17 The prevailing guidelines for fund channeling and disbursement are the Ministry of Finance Regulations (PMK) No. \n191/PMK.05/2011 and 188/PMK.07/2012. \n ", "10   \n31.  Consolidated  financial  reports  will  be  prepared  by  DGBE  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment Financial Information System and will be submitted to ADB and MOF. BPK will \naudit the financial statements annually, including compliance reviews on the utilization of district \ngrants in accordance with the agreed guidelines. Annual BPK audits will be conducted at MOEC \nand at the project districts. DGBE, with support of the OMT and the district advisory teams, will \nassist project district administrations to undertake the necessary financial reporting required \nunder the project\u2019s financial compliance requirements, and train district staff in financial planning, \naccounting, auditing, and control, and implement a performance-based planning and budgeting \nsystem. The districts will likewise ensure proper monitoring, particularly of activities funded \nthrough district grants. To facilitate and oversee the release of district grants, the staff capacity \nof the Indonesia Resident Mission disbursement unit will be strengthened by additional staff. \nThe resident mission will conduct random spot checks biannually at project districts. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with MOEC, \nand will be explained to all project districts during the initial phase of the project.  \n \n32.  Reporting. The program director and manager, assisted by the OMT, will prepare an \ninception  report  including  an  initial  work  plan  for  2013\u20132015.  The  inception  report  will  be \nsubmitted to the EU and ADB within 3 months of project approval. The work plan and budget \nwill be reviewed and approved by the EU in conjunction with ADB. Unforeseen additional \nconsultant inputs will require prior approval from the EU. An indicative plan of key activities for \nthe first 2 years is in Supplementary Appendix 6. In addition to the inception report, the DGBE, \nsupported by the OMT and the technical advisors, will prepare the following reports to be \nsubmitted to the EU and ADB: (i) technical progress and financial reports to be submitted every \nsix months; (ii) successive annual work plans and budgets for calendar years 2013, 2014, 2015; \nand (iii) a completion report indicating achievement toward agreed outputs and outcomes and \nincorporating lessons and recommendations for any follow up.  \n \n33.  External monitoring. External evaluations (mid-term and final) independently financed \nby the EU are expected to take place during project implementation (indicatively, in 2014 and \n2015). These evaluations will be government-led and coordinated with ADB. \n \nIV.  THE RANKING VICE-PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n34.  The Ranking Vice-President recommends that the Board of Directors approve: (i) ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac37,300,000  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the European Union for the \nMinimum  Service  Standards  Capacity  Development  Program;  and  (ii)  the  expansion  of \nprocurement  eligibility  for  the  technical  assistance  to  allow  the  procurement  of  goods and \nservices including the engagement of consultants from non-ADB member countries.

Oversight of the MSSs across all government services are the responsibility of the \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA), with the line ministries responsible for issuing the regulation in \nconsultation with the Regional Autonomy Development Council (DPOD), and providing technical \nadvice on the content and measurement issues and monitoring education improvements.  \n \n2.  At the present time MSSs have been approved for 14 sectors. This achievement is a key \nplank in the continued progress of the decentralisation process in governance. It is important \nthat partners working with district/city governments on MSSs in education recognise competing \npriorities and also capitalise on opportunities for cross-sectoral learning and support. Local \ngovernment is required to make progress across the other 13 sectors for which MSSs have \nbeen issued and Mayors/Bupatis must report annually to MOHA on achievements. Capacity \ndevelopment  for  one  sector  should  have  flow-on  benefits  across  other  sectors;  enhanced \ncommunity  engagement,  transparency  and  accountability  in  one  sector  will  enhance \ngovernment as a whole. The design of the MSSs Capacity Development Program recognises \nthe value of strong partnership between line ministries and departments at both national and \nlocal level.  \n \nMSSs in Education  \n \n3.  Over the past two decades the Government has twice previously sought to introduce \nMSSs in education as a   means of providing equity for its citizens and providing a mechanism \nfor the accountability of local government. The two previous draft MSSs for the education sector \nfailed to become institutionalised, mainly because they focussed on aspirational output targets \n(eg. participation targets and exam results) with little guidance or support for districts on how to \nachieve these. It also appears that there was insufficient attention to the creation of an enabling \nenvironment and the development of capacity at district/city level for implementation.  \n \n4.  In 2008-10 the EU in collaboration with ADB, provided technical assistance through the \nBasic Education Sector Capacity Support Program (BE-SCSP)1 to the Government to develop \neducation MSSs that would be achievable and would contribute to enhanced service delivery in \nbasic education. In close collaboration with MOHA and MOEC, the BE-SCSP assisted the \nGovernment to develop a set clearly-defined MSSs with the intent to help districts to achieve \nnational targets for basic education, as defined in the RENSTRA 2005-2009, the EFA targets \nand the MDGs for basic education. Further, the TA has helped the Government to develop a \nstrategy  to  strengthen  district  capacity  to  plan,  budget,  manage,  implement  and  monitor \nachievement  of  MSSs  at  their  respective  districts.  The  implementation  of  strategies  to \naccelerate achievement towards MSSs had been piloted in five districts, which demonstrated \nthat progress is difficult without on-going leadership and support. \n \n5.  The MSSs were developed collaboratively with MOHA and MOEC, piloted and then \nreviewed by education stakeholders prior to final submission to government. These MSSs were \napproved by Regulation 15/2010 in July 2010. Since that time they have been actively promoted \n                                                 \n1  Under the TA 4391-INO: \u201cBasic Education Sector Capacity Support Program (BE SCSP)\u201d, ADB provided technical \nassistance to assist the Government in the development of the MSSs. The TA was   financed by the EU. The \ncooperation agreement between EU and ADB was signed in December 2007 for Euro 4.2 million. The TA was \nsuccessfully completed by 31 December 2010.   \n ", "22  Supplementary Appendix 2 \nand implemented. The MSSs are simple and focus on a relatively small number of school-level \nand  district/city-level  inputs  and  processes  that  are  regarded  as  providing  the  minimum \nessential conditions for learning. They can be readily judged to be either present or absent.  \n \n6.  The district level MSSs include 4 clusters of 14 indicators: access and infrastructure (4); \nprovision of adequate numbers of teachers (2); qualifications of teachers (6); district quality \nassurance and management (2). The school level MSSs include 3 clusters of 13 indicators: \nprovision  of  resources for  learning  (4);  teaching  process  indicators (5);  and  school  quality \nassurance and management indicators (4). Detail indicators of the MSSs are described in para \n30 and 31 of Appendix 2.  \n \n7.  The district/city is responsible to ensure that it meets the MSSs, both in the support of \nschools and in the management and planning of education in accord with MSSs standards. \nBecause the indicators can be judged to be either met or not met, the MSSs function as a \nsimple tool for assessing performance and guiding more effective and efficient sub-national \nplanning  and  improvement  processes.  As  such  they  become  an  effective  policy  lever  for \nstrengthening governance, accountability and equity-based provision of services. \n \nRole of the MSSs in reducing regional disparities and achieving MDGs \n \n8.  Using the MSSs, districts/cities can be compared on the extent to which they are fulfilling \ntheir responsibilities \u2013 for example, to adequately provide schools that are accessible, furnished, \nstaffed with qualified teachers and appropriately supervised. Schools can likewise be compared \non the extent to which they are providing the basic learning resources, the required hours of \ninstruction, appropriate teaching and assessment in classrooms and quality assurance practices \nand management of the school.  Analysis of information on the extent to which schools and \ndistricts/cities are complying with the MSSs and calculation of the MSSs gap provide entry \npoints for improvement at both the school and the district/city level.  \n  \n9.  Experience over the past three years since MSSs was mandated has demonstrated the \npower of information which, if communicated effectively and championed by political leaders, \ncan  trigger  action  to  meet  the  MSSs.  Gorontalo  district  is  cited  frequently  as  the  leading \nexample of this however there are also other districts where action is being taken to bring \nschools up to MSSs \u2013 i.e. in Aceh, Papua and Sleman, Gresik.  \n \n10.  Action  to  ensure  schools  meet  MSSs  supports  MDG2  (achieving  universal  primary \neducation by 2015) in significant ways. Firstly, by improving district capacity to plan for and take \nthe necessary steps to provide schools within access of all children; secondly by ensuring that \nall schools are able to provide the basic conditions for learning to occur. MDG2 is meaningless if \nschools exist but are unable to provide effective learning opportunities for students. MSSs \nspecify the minimum conditions for proper learning to occur \u2013 a sufficient numbers of qualified \nteachers, a safe environment for learning, adequate learning resources, appropriate classroom \npractices and supportive management.  \n \nWhat has been learned from MSSs implementation to date?  \n \n11.  Following the completion and approval of the MSSs, the EU funded BE-SCSP also \nsupported a Baseline Survey and a Pilot Program. These two activities provided information on ", "  Supplementary Appendix 2  23 \nthe status quo regarding MSSs, the cost of addressing the gap in service provision and action \nresearch into how districts would go about the task of applying the MSSs.  \n\u2022  The Baseline Survey 2 \n12.  The Baseline Survey was undertaken in 2010 with the following objectives \u2013 (i) to \nprovide information on the status quo of MSSs in districts/cities and schools in 2010 and provide \nthe baseline against which progress can be measured; (ii) to provide information for calculating \nthe \u201cMSSs-gap\u201d in order to estimate additional requirements (HR and finance) at district/city and \nschool level to meet MSSs in the next three years; (iii) to identify variation among districts/cities \nin terms of their readiness, fiscal capacity, and institutional capacity for implementation of MSSs. \nA  multi-stage  stratified  random  sample  was  designed  which  included  5,242  schools  in  60 \ndistrict/cities.  \n \n13.  Overall, for the district/city MSSs, the survey found very weak demographic planning and \nsupervision of schools: for example, less than 20% of schools received effective supervision \nfrom the district/city. Overall, there was near-adequate provision of numbers of teachers and the \nnumber of classrooms but very variable quality of both.  There were significant differences \nbetween city and district/city provisions. The qualitative evidence collected with the Baseline \nSurvey showed many schools to be in poor condition and classrooms not conducive to learning. \n \n14.  In relation to the school-level MSSs, the key areas of low compliance were related to \nprovision of resources for learning, adequate supervision of the teaching process and active \nengagement of the school community in all aspects of school-based management. For example: \nmore than two thirds of schools were not providing each student with a set of 4 textbooks; more \nthan 80% of schools did not have 100 enrichment books and 10 reference books; 80% (SD) \u2013 \n90% (MI) did not have the 6 items of science teaching resources specified; teachers were \ngenerally under-utilized and around 40% of schools were not providing the minimum hours of \ninstruction; in one third of MOEC  schools (SD) and almost half of the MORA schools (MI), \nprincipals did not visit classrooms regularly to provide supervision and feedback to teachers; \nmore than 80% of schools had some elements of effective school-based management but 40% \n(SD) to 50% (MI) did not meet the 3 criteria of an annual plan, an annual report and evidence of \nan effective school committee.   \n \n15.  The  Baseline  Survey  found  statistically  significant  differences  between    the  3 main \nregions of Indonesia (western, central and eastern) on provision of classrooms and furniture, \nprovision of qualified teachers and provision of textbooks and science kits in primary schools, \nthe hours of duty of teachers and the hours of instruction for students. Eastern region lagged \nbehind on almost all infrastructure items, provision of teachers, qualifications of teachers and \nprincipals and the provision of reference and enrichment materials.     \n \n16.  Using the data from the Baseline Survey an initial costing study was undertaken to \nproject the cost of meeting MSSs nationally. This study was limited to the \u201cbig ticket items\u201d for \nwhich reliable unit costs were available. For example, for districts/cities, the costs associated \nwith upgrading infrastructure (classrooms, science laboratories and staff rooms for teachers) \nwere estimated to be 18 trillion Rupiah for primary education and 8 trillion Rupiah for junior \nsecondary education, nationally.   For schools, the cost of providing textbooks (calculated with a \n                                                 \n2  Basic Education Sector Capacity Support Program: Executive Summary Report \u2013 Baseline Survey MSSs. Dec \n2010.  ", "24  Supplementary Appendix 2 \nlife of 3 years) was estimated to be 412,000 Rupiah per primary student and 731,000 Rupiah \nper junior secondary student.  \n \n17.  While the costing study was important, it can also be seen from the Baseline Survey that \nmany  of  the  MSSs  that  were  not  being  met  were  related  to  planning,  management  and \nsupervision arrangements at both school and district/city level. These MSSs can all be remedied \nby capacity development and do not require massive injections of recurrent capital. For example: \nprincipals visiting classrooms and providing feedback to teachers; principals providing more \ninformation  to  parents  and  engaging  their  communities  in  school  planning,  budgeting  and \nreporting; and supervisors visiting schools for the purpose of school improvement. These are all \nprocesses  which  support  increased  quality  of  education  and  can  be  established  through \nsustained capacity development.     \n \n18.  The equitable availability of student textbook provision is a stark example of this point. It \nis a fact that since the increase in school operating funds (BOS), the provision of adequate \nschool learning resources (e.g. textbooks and library materials) should now be within reach of \nall schools, but it is not. The reasons that many schools are unable to provide these basic \nlearning  resources  largely  reflect  poor  school-level  planning  and  poor  decision-making \nprocesses at both district and school level about competing priorities such as payments to \nhonorary teachers, many of  whom could be regarded as excess to requirements if trained \nteachers were deployed more efficiently.  Improved quality of planning and decision-making \nabout education resources such as textbooks is an outcome of sustained capacity development \nat school and district level.    \n \n\u2022  The Pilot Study in 5 districts3  \n19.  In 2010-11, a pilot program was conducted by MOEC with BE-SCSP assistance in 5 \ndistricts/cities to provide support for implementation and learn from these pilot districts what \nwould  be  the  likely  capacity  development  needs  and  enabling  conditions  for  successful \nimplementation of MSSs. The district/cities were Musi Bunyuassin, Sleman, Gresik, Gorontalo \nand Lombok Tengah. The criteria for the selection of these districts included: commitment of the \neducation office to engage in the pilot, availability of data at the district office and a record of \nachievement in improving education services in the district. The desired outcome of the pilot \nprogram in each district was the successful completion and approval of district development \nplans and school improvement plans to achieve MSSs. TA advisor assistance was provided for \nsocialisation  activities,  advocacy,  data  collection  and  analysis,  costing  and  budgeting, \nformulation of plans and preparation of decrees. While the districts varied considerably in size \nand on geographic and economic factors, a key common finding at the start of the pilot was the \nlack of accurate data to inform planning for MSSs.   \n \n20.  At the conclusion of the pilot, key findings relevant for the MSSs Capacity Development \nProgram are: (i) the need for more effective promotion of the Regulation 15/2010; (ii) the need \nfor more explicit guidelines for interviewers and data collectors in assessing MSSs; (iii) the \nimportance for sustained capacity development for MSSs at district/city level; (iv) the share of \nlocal budget allocated for education is a key indicator of relevance and commitment at local \nlevel;  (v)  education  officials  and  school  personnel  need  to  understand  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities for  MSSs; (vi) the timing of MSSs assessment and planning must be aligned \nwith the school year and the annual planning and budgeting cycles for schools and district/cities; \n                                                 \n3  Basic Education Sector Capacity Support Program: Final Report MSSs Pilot Districts 2012 ", "  Supplementary Appendix 2  25 \n(vii) the MSSs must be integrated with the annual school census and data collection process; \n(viii)    leadership  and  commitment  of  local  government  is  critical;  (ix)  a  good  coordination \nbetween district education office and the local office of MORA is essential; (x) a single data set \nand agreed data collection processes between all users and stakeholders must be developed to \nensure trust and cooperation. These lessons have been taken into account in the design of the \nactivities under the three outputs of the proposed project. Consultant teams at the national and \nthe district level will help to build up capacity of respective administrations and school/madrasah \nmanagements to address issues identified and improve overall understanding of the importance \nof the MSSs as efficient tool to improve resource allocation and monitor the quality of education \ndelivery. The engagement of a PR firm to deliver a multifaceted advocacy and leadership \ncampaign will provide additional support to address the need for more effective promotion and \nawareness creation of MSSs. \n \n21.  In addition, four key areas were identified for urgent action: MOHA issue a further \ncircular letter prioritizing MSSs in annual budgeting; a common electronic EMIS be developed \nfor all levels \u2013 including schools and district/cities; greater awareness of MSSs be promoted \nthrough annual reporting of MSSs status in the annual publications of BPS (Center of Statistic); \ncontinued technical assistance for both data collection and the use of data in formulating plans \nto improve education.  \n \n22.  In 2012, it was observed that three of the five districts/cities had attained the successful \noutcome: a district/city operational plan and an approved budget to support MSSs. It is expected \nthat the two districts who did not reach the outcome will achieve it in 2012.   \n \n23.  Reflection by MOEC senior officers on the pilot program include the observation that the \ndifferences between the districts that achieved the outcome and those that did not were related \nto: the strength of leadership and stability of staff within the education office; having a strong \ntechnical  focal  point  (e.g.  someone  qualified  in  basic  education)  within  the  office;  early \nengagement of the  legislative arm of the government in order to effect the necessary legislation \nand decrees in a timely manner; the active engagement of a wide group of stakeholders inside \nand outside of government.  \n \n24.  CIDA is currently implementing a project to enhancing Social Services (The Basics \nProject)  which  is  being  implemented  in  6  districts  in  each  of  two  provinces.  The  planned \noutcomes are that: (i) District/city governments and legislative councils develop and implement \nplans  and  budgets  leading  to  more  responsive,  pro  poor,  gender-based,  environmentally \nsustainable MDG/MSSs-based social service provision; (ii) Provincial and national governments \nprovide  improved  support  and  supervision  to  district/city  governments  in  the  planning  and \nbudgeting processes for MDG/MSSs-based social service provision; (iii) Civil society better able \nto provide input to government planning and budgeting processes for MDG/MSSs-based social \nservice  provision,  and  provide  technical  services  to  district/city  governments;  (iv)  Gender \nequality and environmental sustainability knowledge are incorporated into the planning and \nbudgeting processes for MDG/MSSs-based social service provision. A recent Basics national \nworkshop to review progress and innovations in implementing both Health and Education MSSs \nas a means of achieving MDGs highlighted a number of factors deemed critical to success. \nThese success factors were: Leadership \u2013 from the leaders of both the elected and executive \narms  of  government;  Partnership  and  cooperation  between  the  levels  of  government; \nCooperation between the elected and executive arms of government; Active engagement of \ncommunity  and civil society organizations in communication, mediation, providing technical \nassistance and monitoring; accurate data and facts to challenge assumptions and stereotypes \nand  underpin  decision-making;  Institutionalization  for  sustainability  \u2013  involving  local ", "26  Supplementary Appendix 2 \nrepresentatives from the start, providing information and training for all stakeholders, enshrining \nchanges by regulation and by inclusion in budget. 4 These factors are similar to those identified \nfrom the BE-SCSP pilot study and provide both a solid rationale and the content areas for the \nadvocacy strategy envisioned for this project.  \n \n25.  The Government is aware that achievement of MSSs in all districts/cities and schools by \n2014 is a challenging task. Yet without this foundation of the MSSs, the disparities between \nschools  will  continue:  good  schools  will  continue  to  improve  and  poorly  resourced,  poorly \nmanaged schools will continue to fail their communities.  \n \n26.  The fiscal environment is conducive to accelerating MSSs achievement. Since MSSs \nwas  regulated,  the  Government  has  demonstrated  the  will  and  fiscal  capacity  to  improve \ninfrastructure and increase the numbers of qualified and certified teachers. The commitment to \ndirect 20% of national budget to education has been met for the fourth consecutive year. At \ndistrict level, the average education share of district budget is now 35%. Encouragingly, the \npoorest quintile districts, which previously lagged behind others in education share of budget, \nclosed the gap in 2010. Poorest district spent 32% of their total budget on education in 2010 \ncompared with 27% in 2009. Notwithstanding this very positive trend, 29 of the poorest districts \nshowed a decline in their education share of district budget in 2010. This makes such districts \nprime targets for capacity development.5  \n \n27.  In addition, the key line Ministries connected with the implementation of education MSSs \nhave continued to work on the enabling environment: in March 2011, MOHA issued Circular \n100/67/6/SJ urging districts to accelerate their efforts to achieve MSSs. Also in 2011, a new \nJoint  Ministerial  Regulation  (MOEC,  MOHA,  MORA,  BKN)  was  issued  to  support  the \ndeployment of teachers in order to reduce disparities and to achieve MSSs in the provision of \nqualified teachers. \n  \n28.  These fiscal and legislative developments are critically important policy levers but more \naction is needed at the local level to effect change in a country as diverse and decentralized as \nIndonesia. Evidence from multiple program reviews together with experience gathered from \ncurrent programs has demonstrated that powerful levers can be applied at the local level. These \nlocal levers are: enhanced leadership and capacity of district representatives and officials; and \nthe empowerment of civil society to demand change. Put simply, elected officials and public \nservants need to understand their roles and be competent and supported in their execution; and \ncivil society must be informed and empowered to contribute to decision-making through active \nengagement in the democratic processes and through effective public advocacy for the services \nto which they are entitled.  \n \n29.  Development partners in the education sector are already contributing to these two local \nlevel  policy  levers  on  a  significant  scale.  An  informal  mapping  of  such  programs  being \nsupported by development partners (AusAID, UNICEF, CIDA, EU/Netherlands BEC-TF and \nUSAID) suggests that possibly a quarter of the districts in Indonesia  have been receiving some \nform, or multiple forms, of capacity development assistance in the past 3 -5 years, including \nschool based management training. However progress is slow and some of the poorest and \n                                                 \n4   Canadian International Development Agency: Basics Project.

Overview of the MSSs indicators as stipulated in the Minister of National Education \nDecree number 15/2010 consisting of two categories: (1) indicators for district/city education \nservices and (2) indicators for school level services.   \n \n31.  The indicators of basic education services, which are the responsibility of the district/city \ngovernment are: \n(i)  An education unit is available within walking distance at a maximum of 3 km \naway for elementary schools (SD/MI) and 6 km away for junior high schools (SMP/MTs) \nfrom permanent residential settlements in a remote region; \n(ii)  The number of students in each class for elementary schools (SD/MI) is not more \nthan 32 and for junior high schools (SMP/MTs) not more than 36. 1 (one) classroom is \nmade available for each class furnished with a sufficient number of desks and chairs \nfor students and teachers, and a whiteboard; \n(iii)  At each junior high school (SMP/MTs), a natural science lab is made available \nand furnished with desks and chairs for 36 students and a minimum of one set of \nnatural science lab tools for students\u2019 demonstration and experiments; \n(iv)  At each elementary school (SD/MI) and junior high school (SMP/MTs), a teacher \nroom is made available and furnished with desks and chairs for teachers, principal and \nother education staff; and at each junior high school (SMP/MTs), a principal\u2019s room is \nmade available and separate from the teacher room. \n(v)  At each elementary school (SD/MI), a teacher is provided for 32 students and 6 \n(six) teachers for each education unit and, in the case of a special region, 4 (four) \nteachers for each education unit; \n(vi)  At each junior high school (SMP/MTs), 1 (one) teacher is provided for each \nsubject and, in the case of a special region, one teacher for each cluster of subjects; \n(vii)  At  each  elementary  school  (SD/MI),  2  (two)  teachers  have  academic \nqualifications of bachelor\u2019s degree (S1) or 4-year program (D-IV) and 2 (two) teachers \nhold educator certificates; \n(viii)  At  each  junior  high  school  (SMP/MTs),  70%  of  teachers  have  academic \nqualifications of S1 or D-IV and half of them (35% of the total teachers) hold educator \ncertificates and, in the case of a special region, 40% have S1 or D-IV qualifications \nand 20% of them hold educator certificates; \n(ix)  At each junior high school (SMP/MTs), teachers have academic qualifications of \nS1 or D-IV and hold educator certificates, each for Mathematics, Natural Sciences, \nIndonesian Language and English Language; \n(x)  In each Regency/City, all SD/MI principals have academic qualifications of S1 or \nD-IV and hold educator certificates; \n(xi)  In each Regency/City, all SMP/MTs principals have academic qualifications of S1 \nor D-IV and hold educator certificates; \n(xii)  In  each  Regency/City,  all  school  and  madrasah  supervisors  have  academic \nqualifications of S1 or D-IV and hold educator certificates; ", "28  Supplementary Appendix 2 \n(xiii)  Regency/city  governments  have  a  plan  and  carry  out  activities  to  assist \neducation units in developing a curriculum and effective learning processes; and \n(xiv)  Supervisors make a visit to education units every month and 3 hours of the visit \nare used for supervision and guidance. \n \n32.  The indicators of MSSs for basic education services which are the responsibility of  \neducation unit (school or madrasah) include: \n  (i)  Each SD/MI provides each student with a set of textbooks declared eligible by \nthe  Government  for  the  subjects  of  Indonesian  Language,  Mathematics,  Natural \nSciences and Social Sciences; \n  (ii)  Each SMP/MTs provides each student with a set of textbooks declared eligible \nby the Government for all subjects; \n  (iii)  Each SD/MI provides a set of natural science visual aid and materials that cover \nhuman  skeleton,  globe,  optical  equipment  samples,  natural  science  kit  for  basic \nexperiments and natural science posters; \n  (iv)  Each SD/MI has 100 titles of enrichment book and 10 titles of reference book, \nand each SMP/MTs has 200 titles of enrichment book and 20 titles of reference book; \n(v)  Each permanent teacher works 37.5 hours per week in education units, including \nplanning learning, providing learning, assessing learning results, guiding or training \nstudents and carrying out supplementary tasks; \n(vi)  Education  units  undertake  a  learning  process  34  weeks  per  year  with  the \nfollowing face-to-face learning activities: \na) Grade I-II    : 18 hours per week; \nb) Grade III    : 24 hours per week; \nc) Grade IV-VI    : 27 hours per week;  \nd) Grade VII-IX   : 27 hours per week; \n(vii)  Education units adopt an education unit curriculum (KTSP) in accordance with \nthe effective regulations; \n(viii)  Each teacher adopts a learning plan (RPP) prepared on the basis of a syllabus \nfor the subject he/she teaches; \n(ix)  Each teacher develops and adopts an assessment program to help improve the \nlearning capacity of his/her students; \n(x)  The  principal  exercises  supervision  over  classrooms  and  gives  feedback  to \nteachers twice each semester; \n(xi)  Each teacher submits a subject evaluation report and a student assessment \nreport to the principal at the end of each semester in the form of a report on student \nachievements; \n(xii)  The school or madrasah principal presents reports on semester examination \nresults  (UAS)  and  Promotion  Examination  (UKK)  and  final  examination \n(school/national examination) to students\u2019 parents and send a recapitulation to the \nRegency/City Education Office (Dinas) or Religious Ministry Office at the end of each \nsemester; and \n(xiii)  Each education unit adopts school-based management principles (MBS). ", "  Supplementary Appendix 3  29 \nIndicative List of Districts to be included under the MSSs Capacity Development Program \n \n \n1.  In  the  absence  of  an  agreed  comprehensive  approach  to  develop  a  substantiated \nranking  of  districts  according  to  MSSs  performance,  the  Government  has  chosen  a  mix \napproach to select the 110 districts to participate in the MSSs Capacity Development Program, \nwhich is based on enrollment  rates and the Fiscal  Capacity  Index (FCI) of districts, as \nstipulated in the Minister of Finance\u2019s Decree number 226/PMK.07/2012 dated 26 December \n2012. \n \n2.  At the first step all districts with net enrollment rates of primary education (SD) and gross \nenrollment  rate  of  junior  secondary  education  (SMP)  below  75%  have  been  selected  (42 \ndistricts in 16 provinces)1 . \n \n3.  It was agreed to focus the project on a limited number of provinces, which will allow \nincluding a reasonable number of districts in these selected provinces \u2013 instead of covering all \nprovinces nationwide, which would increase transaction costs in managing project activities. \nWorking  in  a  reasonable  number  of  districts  within  the  selected  provinces  will  improve \nopportunities to create synergies and transfer lessons. The 16 selected provinces selected \nbased  on  enrollment  rates  represent  four  regions  in  Indonesia:  (i)  Sumatra;  (ii)  Java,  (iii) \nSulawesi and Kalimantan; and (iv) Bali, NTB, NTT Maluku-Papua. \n \n4.  The selection of the additional 68 districts within the 16 provinces is based on the FCI. \nThe Fiscal Capacity Index is considered as a broadly acknowledged approach to address \nregional disparities with a significant emphasis on poor people. The Fiscal Capacity <FC> is \ndefined as the summation of revenues received by a district2 <R> minus the expenditure for \npersonnel <P> in relation to the number of poor people sited in the respected district <PP>. \n \n/\nR \u2013 P     PP   =   FC  \n \n5.  The estimation of number of poor people located in a respective district is based on the \nnational census data of the Center of Statistics (BPS), released in 2011. \n \n6.  Fiscal Capacity Index <FCI> is defined as the relative fiscal capacity of a respective \ndistrict in relation to the average fiscal capacity of all districts across the country.   \n \n \nFC \n \n= FCI \n n \n/\n\u2211FC     n    \n  1 \n \n7.  Based on this principle, the MOF has published a list ranking districts according to their \nFCIs into four categories of a districts based on the FCI: (i) very high (FCI above 2.00); (ii) high \n(FCI between 1.01 and 2.00); (iii) medium (FCI between 0.50 and 1.00); and (iv) low (FCI less \nthan 0.50). \n                                                 \n1  2 districts in the provinces of Riau and North Maluku with enrollment rates below 75% were not included as the FCI \nof both districts is high, and the regional coverage of the project is limited to 16 provinces to circumvent large high \ntransaction costs in managing activities.   \n2   R  include  local  revenues  (PAD),  resource  sharing  (DBH)  and  general  allocation  (DAU)  from  the  central \ngovernment, and does not include Special Fund allocations and emergency funds. ", "30  Supplementary Appendix  3 \n \n8.  The list of districts under the MSSs Capacity Development Program also include the five \ndistricts, which had been supported as MSSs pilot districts under the EU financed Capacity \nDevelopment Technical Assistance: \u201cBasic Education Sector Capacity Support Program\u201d:  (i) \nKabupaten Musi Banyuasin (South Sumatera); (ii) Kabupaten Sleman (D.I. Yogyakarta); (iii) \nKabupaten  Gorontalo  (Gorontalo);  (iv)  Kabupaten  Gresik  (East  Java);  and  (v)  Kabupaten \nLombok Tengah (NTB). 3 These five pilot districts have successfully conducted district wide \nMSSs assessments and prepared MSSs roadmaps, which have been approved by the local \nparliaments. Lessons from the pilot districts will be useful examples for other districts. Study \nvisits can be arranged to learn from successful approaches to sensitize communities and local \nparliaments,  strengthen  school  inspection  and  continuous  teacher  development  programs, \nimprove  teaching  and  learning  environments  at  schools,  and  develop  well  coordinated \nstrategies with Bupatis, BAPPEDA, MORA, MOEC and other district  key stakeholders to jointly \nwork towards achieving MSSs district wide. Local officials from the pilot districts can also share \ntheir experiences at other districts and be engaged as resource persons to provide advice on \nhow to develop MSSs roadmaps, and integrate MSSs strategies into annual development plans \nand prioritize and budget targeted activities to be approved by local parliaments.   \n \n9.  The selected districts need to document their willingness and commitment to take part in \nthe  MSSs  Capacity  Development  Program.  To  be  eligible  for  district  grant  support  the \nrespective Bupati/Walikota will sign a memorandum of agreement confirming the intent to be \nactively engaged in the project, and specifying counterpart officers and indicative resources to \nbe provided to facilitate MSSs activities.  \n \n10.   Districts, which are unable to document their commitment within 4 months after the \nproject commenced, will be dropped from the list and replaced by districts with the lowest FCI in \nthe respective province or region if all districts of the particular province are already included in \nthe project.

MSSs progress assessment, support for data collection; data analysis and synthesis; \nimproving MSSs monitoring at  the district level;  \nii.  developing  HR  capacity  for  analysis  and strategic  planning;  providing  enhanced \nschool supervision and monitoring for MSSs; strengthening the capacity of Bappeda \nand the office of Bupati/Walikota  working on MSSs;  \niii.  supporting teacher and principals working groups as well as school supervisors in \nstrengthening of improved professional practice toward the achievement of MSSs \nrequirements, and fostering greater understanding of the education MSSs amongst \nteaching professionals;  \niv.  supporting  strengthened  and  formalized  partnerships  between  schools,  their \ncommunities  and  the  local  government  structures,  specifically  in  support  of \nestablishing stronger accountability procedures in respect to the education MSSs;  \nv.  supporting  MSSs advocacy at district/city level, sub-district/city and school level; \nvi.  facilitating  the  continued  engagement  and  commitment  of  district/city  decision \nmakers toward the achievement of education MSSs in their district/city, through: \nschool  or  community  visits,  workshops  presentations  etc;  strengthening  the \ndistrict/city capacity to monitor and assess progress towards the education MSSs in \nall schools.  \n \n21.  The District Advisor Teams will assist the district administrations in the implementation of \nmeasures financed by District Grants, and support districts to integrate strategies and resources \nrequired to meet MSSs in the annual development plans and budgets. Furthermore the District \nAdvisory Teams will support the facilitation of MSSs advocacy campaigns at their respective \ndistricts.  \n \n22.  The  District  Advisory  Teams  will  also  support  the  awareness  campaigns  in  their \nrespective project districts.  \n \n23.  District  Advisory  Teams  will  prepare  quarterly  monitoring  reports,  annual  reports, \nanalysis and synthesis of findings, and summarize \u201cgood practice at districts\u201d.  \n \nPersonnel required \n \n24.  About 60-80 national district advisors will be working with district/city personnel in the \neducation office (Dinas) through intermittent inputs. The total inputs will be approximately 1,700 \nmonths over the 3 years of the project.  The advisors will work in teams of 3 to 5 persons \ndepending on the proximity of districts and the logistics of travel. The skill mixes of the teams \nneed to include the following skills and experience:   \n\u2022  excellent communication and negotiation skills;  \n\u2022  prior experience in capacity development activities and managing projects ;  \n                                                 \n15  Detailed guidance related to eligibility criteria and procedures to use grant funds will be explained in the JUKLAK \nand JUKNIS (guidelines and manuals) that will be developed and approved at the beginning of the project.

MSSs Advocacy Firm16 \n \n25.        An established Public Relations (PR) firm will be recruited through an open tendering \nprocess in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) to prepare and implement a 3-year multifaceted advocacy campaign at the \nnational and local levels with the intent to:  \n \ni.  enhance general public awareness and encourage greater public participation and \ncommunity  engagement  in  ensuring  schools  and  local  government  are  held \naccountable for its provision, and stimulate public demand and advocacy for the \nallocation of adequate resources toward this important goal. \nii.  enhance the awareness of education MSSs among key stakeholders influencing \neducation policy and service delivery, at both the national and sub-national levels; \niii.  nationally publicizing the progress towards education MSSs in project districts to \ngenerate  broader  national  interest  and  support  for  greater  progress  towards \neducation MSSs in all schools and districts/cities.  \n \n26.  The  Firm  should  demonstrate  experience  in  delivery  of  national  and  regional \ncommunications/public  relations  activities,  innovation  in  targeting  strategies,  ability  to \ncustomize key messages for different communities and contexts. The Firm must have the \nresources  and  technical  capability  to  devise  and  implement,  on  a  rolling  basis,  a \ncomprehensive campaign of leadership support, advocacy and promotional activities. The \nnationwide campaign  will  target officials  at key  ministries,  civil society  organizations, the \nmedia, parents and teachers and include the following key strategies: \n\u2022  Sensitizing key stakeholder groups, who influence education policy and service \ndelivery at the national and local levels, on the significance of MSSs in relation to \nprovide  quality  education  services,  measure  performance  progress  and  inform \nresource allocation in the education system; Establish strategies to promote MSSs \nadvocacy including the involvement of local parliaments; \n\u2022  Sensitizing  the general public on the scope and benefits of MSSs; \n\u2022  Establishing positive media relationships, and effective media networks with MOEC, \nMORA, MOHA and among participating project districts/cities;  \n\u2022  Ensuring  strong  linkages  and  commonality  of  message  between:  the  current \nMOEC  communities  sensitization  program;  the  MOHA  MSSs  campaigns;  the \ndistrict/city-led advocacy activities under the block grants; and the EU supported \nnationwide MSSs advocacy campaign;  \n\u2022  Support MOEC and MORA to develop specific education MSSs strategies and \ncampaigns, including adequate materials, web-sites, etc  \n                                                 \n ", "46  Supplementary Appendix 5 \n\u2022  Measuring the impact of advocacy campaigns, potentially through measures such \nas using \u2018tag lines\u2019 and/or more sophisticated approaches.  \n\u2022  Enhance the public appearance of MSSs \u2013related discussions on television, both \nnational  and  local,  as  this  is  the  most  effective  medium  for  disseminating \ninformation.  \n\u2022  Promote the use of regular school/community meetings and notice boards that \nhave significant impact at comparatively low cost; initiate MSSs-school level events. \n\u2022  Consider  SMS  message-  based  campaigns.  Mass-SMS  through  negotiated \nagreements with telecoms companies may provide much wider and assured reach \nof these messages with significantly reduced workload \n\u2022  publicize  and  promote  achievements  and  good  practice  from  the  110  project \ndistricts/cities to encourage and motivate stakeholders to sustain their support of \nMSSs and to broaden commitment across regions. \n \n27.  It is expected that the Firm will include a Communications Expert with at least 10 years\u2019 \nexperience  in  creative  or  management  roles  in  relevant  areas  such  as  media  and \ncommunications, marketing, advertising, public relations, TV and radio promotions, journalism, \nknowledge dissemination, community engagement. There is scope  to outsource specific tasks \nto  firms  specializing  in  specific  media.  The  Communications  Expert  will  be  an  excellent \ncommunicator and negotiator, fluent in English and Bahasa Indonesia, demonstrating innovation \nand capacity to respond to the different regions and cultures of Indonesia. The expert should \nhave  tertiary  level  qualifications  in  communications,  marketing  or  media  and  the  ability  to \ncontract and supervise sub-contractors to deliver the products and services as needed.   \n \n28.  Scope  of  Services.  A  broad  range  of  strategies  will  be  required  to  communicate \neffectively, taking into account the different languages, cultures, community context, district/city \ncapabilities and personnel as well as the geographic context and ITC environments of the 110 \ndistricts. Key messages and the content and timing of campaigns should be developed in \ncollaboration  with  the  MSSs  Technical  Advisors  and  will  require  consultations  with  key \npersonnel in MOEC, MOHA, MORA and the district advisory team.   \n \n29.  The  campaign  will  reinforce  MOHA\u2019s  overall  approach  to  implementing  MSSs,  key \nprinciples underpinning good governance and the role of MSSs in improving education equitably \nacross  Indonesia.  The  agreed  messages  and  delivery  strategies  should  be  piloted  and \nevaluated prior to extensive roll-out. \n \n30.  The campaign should demonstrate innovation and responsiveness to local conditions \nand opportunities. For example, the Firm should consider using a range of organizations at local \nlevel \u2013 e.g.  NGOs to run focus groups, local drama groups for street theatre, local professional \ncommunications media for TV, radio, print and signage.  \n \n31.  The approach for the facilitation of the advocacy campaign will be a rolling design rather \nthan predetermined phases, with close liaison with activities conducted under Output 1. A \nspecific strategy targeting Bupati, Walikota and Members of Parliament should be developed in \nclose consultation with MOHA to be consistent with planned meetings and forums of regional \ngovernment.   \n \n32.  The campaign will be implemented with a rolling plan based on: \n(i)   Identification of stake-holders and the likely key MSSs value propositions for each: \n\u2022  Civil society \u2013 parents, community, NGOs ", "  Supplementary Appendix 5  47 \n\u2022  Education personnel at school level \n\u2022  District city staff   \n\u2022  Broader education institutions (eg. universities) \n\u2022  Elected representatives  \n\u2022  Opinion leaders, village spokespersons, women\u2019s groups, etc \n \n(ii)  Formulation of key messages and delivery strategies for:- \n\u2022  different regions \n\u2022  different stakeholder groups within regions  \n\u2022  different languages and cultural contexts \n\u2022  different ITC/literacy environments \n\u2022  pilot testing prior to roll-out \n \n(iii)  Support for Leadership \u2013  \nThe Firm should recognize the influence of local leaders and champions. The campaign \nshould assist district advisors to identify local champions and support them with activities \nand products that promote and strengthen the positive role of the community and elected \ngovernment officials in ensuring quality improvement. There should be a special focus \non increasing the role of women in school communities and in local government as \nchampions for MSSs.  \n \n(iv)   Feedback and support to the districts/cities \u2013  \nThe Firm should devote resources to celebrating successes, promoting and sharing \ngood practice and disseminating learning from the 110 project districts.  \n \n33.  Small scale piloting is recommended before widespread implementation of untested \nstrategies. Previous research for this project design provides the following recommendations \nbased on the recent BOS Advocacy Campaign supported by the World Bank: \n\u2022  Television, both national and local, is an effective medium for disseminating information. \nThe use of public figures and metaphors within high frequency TV slots has higher \nimpact; \n\u2022  School meetings and notice boards have significant impact at comparatively low cost;  \n\u2022  School events could be augmented through specific interventions such as the screening \nof the inspiring Indonesian film based upon a child\u2019s attempts to keep their school open: \n\u201cLas Kapalani\u201d. A mass production and dissemination of the DVD with introductory and \nclosing messages linked to MSSs advocacy could prove a useful and appealing vehicle \nfor community sensitization; \n\u2022  SMS messages have significant impact but are often not received by the target audience. \nIt can also be highly time consuming. That said, direct mass-SMS through negotiated \nagreements with telecoms companies may provide much wider and assured reach of \nthese messages with significantly reduced workload; \n\u2022  Strengthening good media relations are critical and can lead to a much more positive \ntone in reporting on education MSSs related issues; \n\u2022  Ensuring strong media networks so that regional success stories may receive wider, \neven national airing i.e. positive progress towards education MSSs in a particular district \nthat is picked up by other local and national media; \n\u2022  Print ads have limited effect and are not recommended; \n\u2022  Direct mailing/provision of letters, pocketbooks and other \u2018hand-outs\u2019 has limited impact \nand is not recommended. \n ", "48  Supplementary Appendix 5 \n5.   Un-Allocated TA (about 30 person months of international and national support, \nintermittent)  \n \n34.  A portion of the overall project budget will be reserved as Unallocated TA. There are four \ncategories of need for which the unallocated TA may support the project:  \n\u2022  Research, workshops and seminars identified and led by MOHA to address governance \nissues  relating  to  MSSs  across  all  sectors  at  district  level  (e.g.  involving  a  holistic \napproach  with  Health,  Education  and  other  services  at  local  level),  strengthening \npartnerships and learning from other sectors. \n\u2022  Research, workshops and seminars identified by MORA that will specifically support \nimplementation of MSSs in public and private madrasah. \n\u2022  Research, workshops and seminars identified by MOEC to strengthen harmonization \nbetween related programs implemented at local level, to review relevant international \nexperience, to strengthen partnerships and build capacity at national level.   \n\u2022  Specialist advice identified by the EA during project implementation.    \n35.
