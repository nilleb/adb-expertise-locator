INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) was included in Implementing Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) 2020  Strategic Framework: Wuhan Action Plan, \nendorsed  by  the  11th  CAREC  Ministerial  Conference  on  30  October  2012.  The  Strategic \nFramework for the CAREC Program, 2011\u20132020 (CAREC 2020) has two strategic objectives: (i) \ntrade  expansion;  and  (ii)  improving  industrial competitiveness.1 Within  CAREC  2020,  trade \nfacilitation is one of the four priority sectors of CAREC. Work in this area is guided by the \nTransport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  (TTFS),  approved  in  2007  at  the  6th  CAREC \nMinisterial  Conference.  The  TTFS  has  undergone  a  midterm  review  during  2012\u20132013  to \noptimize its implementation for the remaining period (2014-2020). As a result, a Refined TTFS \n2020 and Implementation Action Plan has been developed and approved in 2013 by the 12th \nCAREC Ministerial Conference on 23\u201324 October in Astana, Kazakhstan.  \n \n2.  At the core of the trade facilitation agenda is the customs cooperation work led by the \nCustoms Cooperation Committee (CCC), which consists of heads of customs administrations of \nCAREC member countries. The objectives of the CCC are to promote concerted customs \nreforms and modernization, and to serve as a regional forum to address issues of common \ninterest. \n \n3.  The CCC focuses its work on five priority areas: simplification and harmonization of \ncustoms procedures and documentation, information and communication technology (ICT) for \ncustoms  modernization  and  data  exchange,  risk  management  and  post-entry  audit,  joint \ncustoms control, and regional transit development. These priority areas are fully consistent with \nthe 10 building blocks for customs in the 21st century as promoted by the World Customs \nOrganization (WCO).  \n \n4.  The TA will support the CCC\u2019s priority area on regional transit development.2 The TA \nwas  discussed  during  the  12th  CCC  meeting  held  on  18  September  2013  in  Astana, \nKazakhstan. Members of the CCC agreed that the regional TA reflects the objectives of the \npriority  area  and  expressed  their  full  support.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. The TA will reinforce and complement work initiated by other TA projects of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) under the CAREC Trade Facilitation Program.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  International trade in Central Asian countries involves external customs transit through a \nneighboring country.4 The reason is their landlocked geography and that most of their trade is \nwith noncontiguous countries5. International rail and road routes, especially those in Kazakhstan \nand  Uzbekistan,  are  heavily  used  for  regional  transit  between  the  southern  Central  Asian \ncountries and their main trading partners Russia, Europe and PRC.6 It is estimated that the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012. CAREC 2020: A Strategic Framework for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, 2011\u2013\n2020. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 October 2013. \n3  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Integrated Trade Facilitation Support for Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation. Manila (TA 6437-REG); ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation: Working with the Private Sector in Trade Facilitation. Manila (TA 7353-REG). \n4  It involves transporting goods from the point of entry to the point of exit in the transit country without paying duties \nand taxes due on domestic consumption in that country. \n5  ADB, 2006 \u201cCentral Asia: increasing gains from trade through regional cooperation in trade policy, transport and \ncustoms transit\u201d.  \n6 \u201cInternational Transport in Central Asia: Current problems and ways forward\u201d, University of Central Asia, 2012. \n ", "2  \noverall transit freight traffic in 2009 in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan \namounted  near  62  million  tons  representing  58%  of  total  trade  of  these  countries.  Even \ndomestic  trade  between  certain  regions  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and \nUzbekistan  involves  customs  transit  through  another  CAREC  country.7.  Accordingly,  the \ncustoms transit regimes in place affect both intra- and extra-regional trade in CAREC countries \nand constitute a binding constraint on trade in the region. Poorly designed and implemented \ncustoms transit regimes in Central Asia make transit time long and unpredictable and are a \nmajor factor in higher trade costs. \n \n6.  The existing transit arrangements in the region are as follows: \n \n(i)  Bilateral and regional agreements. There are many bilateral and regional transport \nagreements designed to mitigate nonphysical barriers to the movement of goods and \npeople  between  CAREC  member  countries.  These  include  (i)  the  Cross-Border \nTransport Agreement under the framework of CAREC, which has been ratified by two \ncountries  (the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan)  and  is  being  studied  for  possible \naccession by a third (Afghanistan); and (ii) multilateral agreements, such as those under \nthe  Transport  Corridor  Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia  Program,  the  Economic  Cooperation \nOrganization, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Progress in finalizing and \nimplementing these agreements has been varied. They mainly address key constraints \non  cross-border  transport,  such  as  restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles  and \ndifferent vehicle dimension standards. In terms of transit, these agreements tend to \narticulate only broad goals as policy directions for developing regional transit systems, \nwhile the bilateral agreements often reflect a balance between the interests of the two \ncountry parties and do not give sufficient consideration to other parties\u2019 interests. The \nexisting bilateral and multilateral agreements in the region are not always in accordance \nwith the WCO\u2019s general principles of customs transit; and some core customs transit \nissues, such as guarantee procedures, are usually left out of these agreements.  \n(ii)  National transit regimes. National transit applies to customs transit not covered by \ninternational or regional agreements8. National transit regimes are limited to national \nterritory  and  do  not  provide  a  chain  guarantee 9  linking  the  adjacent  countries. \nConsequently, a transport operator has to submit separate transit documents in several \ncountries which increases transport time substantially. Providing separate guarantees in \nseveral countries is quite costly. In the absence of a guarantee, convoying is usually \nrequired and the fee for the service is rather high in some countries ranging from \nUS$100 to US$28510. Another problem is that accumulating sufficient vehicles to make \nup a convoy takes time. In addition, all the vehicles in a convoy arrive at the same time \ncreating  an  uneven  workload  for  customs  at  border  crossing  points  and  causing \nsignificant processing delays. \n(iii)  International  road  transport  customs  transit  system. International road transport \n(TIR) is the international customs transit system implemented in the region to facilitate \ncross-border movements by providing a single procedure from the point of departure to \n                                                 \n7  The transport networks inherited from the former Soviet Union crisscross their national borders. \n8  It occurs when transit goods that have entered the country of destination are transferred within the national borders \nfrom the point of entry into the country to a location where they clear customs (dry port or inland container depot). \n9  The principal of the transit operation is required to deposit a guarantee covering the value of taxes and duties that \nwould be due in the country of transit. A guarantee can be provided as a bond by a bank, or as a form of insurance \nby a guarantor who can be reinsured internationally by well-known and reliable insurance companies. \n10 ADB, 2006 \u201cCentral Asia: increasing gains from trade through regional cooperation in trade policy, transport and \ncustoms transit\u201d \n ", "  3\nthe point of destination, with an international guarantee chain.11 It allows trucks covered \nby TIR carnets to travel through transit countries without a customs escort and payment \nof customs deposits. However, in CAREC countries, TIR is predominantly used for long-\ndistance and high-value international shipments to Europe, Iran, and Turkey.12 It is rarely \nused for shorter-distance movements within CAREC, because it is not regarded by \nnational transporters as a cost-effective system for such shipments. The fixed costs of \nthe TIR system are too high for most transport operators from Central Asia.  \n \n7.  Currently, transit movements in the region are inhibited by a lack of regional cooperation \nespecially (i) the lack of mutual recognition of customs control procedures, and customs seals \nand stamps; and (ii) inadequate regional guarantee systems.13 Even when a trade corridor \ncrosses several countries, the basic transit procedure is implemented at the country level. It is \npartly due to transit difficulties through neighboring countries that some Central Asian countries \nhave spent a considerable amount of resources on the construction of new roads primarily to \navoid transit through a neighboring country. \n  \n8.  Authorities in each customs territory along CAREC corridors are ultimately responsible \nfor transit in that territory and can set their own rules. However, integrating transit across \nborders along a trade corridor instead of using a chain of national procedures will facilitate the \nmovement of goods in transit. Large gains are possible with cross-border cooperation and the \ncreation of a framework to integrate transit across territories into a single set of seamless \nprocedures.  \n \n9.  The  Refined  TTFS  focuses  on  the  development  of  six  CAREC  corridors  through \ninfrastructure investments and trade facilitation initiatives to improve the movement of goods \nand people through and across these corridors. In view of customs transit constraints in the \nregion and considering the corridor-based approach adopted, this TA proposes to assist in \nidentifying options for the establishment of an effective and affordable corridor-based customs \ntransit regime as an option for transport operators.14 The TA will also determine the feasibility of \nimplementing a pilot customs transit regime along a priority corridor involving two or more \ncountries. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced cross-border transit in CAREC. The outcome of \nthe TA will be improvement of regional cooperation in customs transit for intraregional trade \nalong CAREC corridors. \n \n11.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs: \n                                                 \n11  The international transit regime initially known in French as transports internationaux routiers (international road \ntransport) is now commonly referred to TIR. All CAREC countries except the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand Pakistan are contracting parties of the TIR Convention. The PRC and Pakistan are in process of accession. \n12  Major long-distance routes using TIR are (i) between Europe and Central Asia, (ii) between Iran or Turkey and \nCentral Asia, (iii) between Europe or Turkey and Azerbaijan, and (iv) between Azerbaijan and Iran. \n13 Cooperation and mutual recognition ensure that control measures undertaken by the customs office of the \nexporting country are accepted by customs offices in the transit and destination countries, and cargo will not be \nsubjected to repeated inspections unless otherwise justified in exceptional cases. \n14  The TIR coexists in many countries with national, bilateral and regional transit systems. Transport operators have \nthe freedom to choose a transit system with the understanding that operators are not forced to switch from one \nsystem to another once transit transport has started from the customs office of departure. \n ", "4  \n(i)  Establishment  of  a  single  regional  guarantee  mechanism.  Developing  a \nsingle  regional  guarantee  throughout  the  transit  period  instead  of  multiple \nguarantees is the core component of a regional transit regime. This would be a \nchain guarantee system that ensures that customs duties and taxes at risk are \ncovered by the national guarantee system of the transport operator.    \n(ii)  Assessment  of  requirements  for  a  streamlined  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for regional customs transit. Compatibility between the countries\u2019 \nnational  transit  legislation  will  be  assessed  to  minimize  additional  legislation \nrequirements, and to prepare a set of draft requirements for a regional transit \nsystem that takes into consideration national and international dimensions. \n(iii)  Identification of a set of recommendations on ICT system development for \nthe regional transit regime. It is important to identify ICT solutions that can add \nvalue  to  the  development  of  a  regional  guarantee  system.  Unlike  customs \nclearance,  which  happens  in  one  place,  transit  requires  an  exchange  of \ninformation from at least three places: transit initiation, transit termination, and \nguarantor (to validate and discharge the bond). The management and tracing of \ncargo manifests are not always properly and rigorously implemented, and in \nmany cases are not automated, causing major errors and delays. An ICT system \ncan be an instrument for seamless exchange of information on a transit manifest, \nand for initiation and termination of a bond. ICT options should be reviewed at an \nearly stage and should be decided on during the development of a transit system. \nThe TA will provide recommendations on the proposed role of and requirements \nfor an ICT system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The following activities will be undertaken under the TA: \n \n(i)  Single regional guarantee mechanism. The project will support consultations \nbetween  customs  authorities,  potential  guarantee  organizations  (banks  and \ninsurance companies), transporters, and members of the CAREC Federation of \nCarrier and Forwarder Associations with a view to designing a chain guarantee \nsystem to ensure that customs duties and taxes at risk are covered. This will \ninclude discussions with current guarantors under national transit systems to \nconsider how their national guarantees might be extended across borders.  \n(ii)  Legal and regulatory framework. Assistance will be provided to assess the \ncompatibility between CAREC countries\u2019 national transit legislation to minimize \nlegislation requirements. The results of the assessment will be used to prepare a \nset  of  draft  requirements  for  a  regional  transit  system  that  takes  into \nconsideration national and international dimensions.  \n(iii)  ICT support systems. An assessment will be done on the current use of ICT in \ntransit operations in CAREC countries, and opportunities will be identified for \nenhancing ICT to support the development of a regional transit system.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The project will be part of the \nTrade Facilitation Mechanism initiated by the Government of Japan in November 2010. The \ngovernments of CAREC countries will provide counterpart support in the form of necessary \n ", "  5\noffice space, counterpart staff, and other services to the consultants, and will assist in arranging \nmeetings with counterpart agencies. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will serve as the executing agency. The Public Management, Financial Sector and \nRegional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will be a focal point and will \nadminister the TA in close coordination with the CAREC Unit of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the WCO and will contribute \nto implementation of the memorandum of understanding between ADB and WCO signed on 4 \nMay 2010 during ADB\u2019s 43rd Annual Meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In addition, the Customs \nand Tariff Bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Japan International Cooperation Agency \nwere consulted in terms of relevance and approach of the proposals. It was decided that ADB \nwill provide them with information about activities to be undertaken during implementation and \nthat the Customs and Tariff Bureau will participate in workshops and events for experience \nsharing with CAREC countries. The TA will be implemented over 2 years and 2 months, from 1 \nMarch 2014 to 30 April 2016. \n \n15.  A total of 20 person-months of international consulting services and 70 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the \nTA. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All consultants will be \nselected and engaged through a firm, except for a transit facilitation project analyst who will be \nrecruited on an individual basis. The preferred selection method for the consultants is quality- \nand cost-based selection with a quality cost ratio of 80:20. All consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  The international consultants will be specialists in customs transit, transport, and trade \nfacilitation. They will be supervised by ADB\u2019s task manager(s), with a lead consultant serving as \nthe main focal point and providing overall coordination to a team of experts working mainly in \nthe  field.  National  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  international  consultants  by \nresearching  and  compiling  documents  and  information,  translating  documents,  organizing \ntraining seminars and other events, and providing administrative and logistical support. The \nnational consultants will have extensive, in-depth regional and local knowledge. \n \n17.  The TA outputs, particularly the findings and recommendations from assessments and \nstudies, will be disseminated through workshops, seminars, conferences, and publications, as \nwell as the CAREC website. Progress of the TA will be monitored using the intended outcome \nand outputs described in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Facilitation of Regional Transit Trade \nin Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nEnhanced cross- By 2020, transit trade in  National customs  CAREC governments \nborder transit in  the corridors where the  service reports  continue to support \nCAREC corridors  agreed customs transit    regional cooperation \nregime is piloted  CAREC trade and  initiatives to expand trade \nincreases by 15%  transport facilitation  and improve \ncompared to the 2010  progress reports  competitiveness in the \nbaseline1    region. \nCAREC Corridor   \nPerformance  Risk \nMeasurement and   \nMonitoring quarterly  Political instability in some \nand annual reports  CAREC countries may \n  disrupt reforms being \nCCC meeting reports   undertaken. \n \nTA completion report \nOutcome      Assumption \n  By September 2016  CAREC trade and   \nRegional cooperation  CAREC countries agree  transport facilitation  Regional transit \nin customs transit  to pilot a customs transit  progress reports  development remains a \nimproved for  regime for a corridor,    regional cooperation \nintraregional trade  involving at least two    priority for customs \nalong CAREC  countries  CCC meeting reports  authorities of CAREC. \ncorridors     \n  TA completion report  Risk \n \nControl mentality and \nprevalence of customs \nconvoys may hamper the \nadoption of the regional \ntransit system. \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.
