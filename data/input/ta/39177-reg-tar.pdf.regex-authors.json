Strengthening the development capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) is a \nmajor part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) efforts on harmonization, alignment, and \nmanaging for development results. In the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,1 ADB and \nother multilateral development banks (MDBs) agreed to work together with partner governments \non strengthening the use of country systems and institutions. This regional technical assistance \n(TA)2 supports these efforts. \n \n2.  The  use  of  well-designed  country  systems  has  significant  potential  to  improve \ndevelopment impact, increase country ownership, facilitate harmonization, simplify processes, \nand reduce costs. The concept of country systems suggests a move away from the traditional \nmodel in which ADB\u2019s financial management, procurement, and safeguard policies are applied \nonly to ADB-financed activities. The country systems approach supports the development and \nimplementation of effective government policies across a range of government activity. Country \nsystems and procedures typically include, but are not restricted to, national arrangements and \nprocedures  for  public  financial  management,  accounting,  auditing,  procurement,  results \nframeworks,  and  monitoring.  Applying  country  procurement  systems3  in  MDB-  and  donor-\nfinanced projects gives DMCs greater flexibility in their choice of procurement methods. It also \nrecognizes that there are country-specific needs that should be accommodated, especially for \nmiddle-income countries.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The quality of country systems varies widely, and it will be essential to ensure that \nprocurement  systems  proposed  for  use  in  ADB-financed  projects  promote  economy  and \nefficiency in a transparent and nondiscriminatory environment. Just as different countries may \nhave different performance levels, different sectors and different levels of government may also \nhave varying performance levels. The use of country systems for ADB-financed operations may \ntherefore be limited\u2014by agreement with DMCs\u2014to certain sectors and executing agencies that \nhave demonstrated strong capacity and performance. ADB will follow a step-by-step approach \nin using country procurement systems that are justified by the anticipated benefits in project \nadministration outcomes. This will be done in consultation with DMCs and other development \npartners,  particularly  the  World  Bank.  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  streamlining  procurement \nprocesses,  harmonizing  with  the  regulations  of  other  multilateral  institutions,  enhancing \ntransparency, strengthening and allowing greater flexibility and innovation in the procurement \nprocedures of DMCs is reflected in the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative; and in the updating of \nADB\u2019s guidelines for consulting services and procurement, approved by the ADB Board of \nDirectors in February 2006.  \n \n4.  Procurement outcomes will be improved by active and determined collaboration within \nthe international community. Moving forward on the agenda outlined in the Paris Declaration \nrequires support at the highest political levels in both donor and client countries. This ensures \nthat procurement reform is integrated into efforts to improve public sector performance, that it is \n                                                 \n1  High Level Forum. 2005. Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness: Ownership, Harmonization, Alignment, Results \nand Mutual Accountability. Paris.  \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 June 2005.  \n3  Country procurement systems refer to the legislative and regulatory framework and implementing regulations, \ndocumentation, and tools for procurement; the institutional framework and capacity for procurement; and the \nprocurement procedures. ", "2   \nprovided  with  sufficient  human  and  financial  resources,  and  that  progress  in  improving \nprocurement outcomes is actively monitored.  \n \n5.  Traditional  efforts  to  strengthen  procurement  systems  have  followed  a  relatively \nstandard sequence. Initial efforts seek to introduce changes in legislation. The passage of \nlegislation sets off a second stage of reform, which features the creation of a process for \nmanaging reform as well as the drafting of additional regulations and standard documents. This \nstage  is  complemented  or  followed  by  programs  to  train  procurement  officials  in  new \nprocedures. However, these efforts have largely been designed as a stand-alone process of \nimproving the techniques of procurement, often with little connection to other reforms. This \napproach to reform has placed the burden of improving overall performance exclusively on the \nshoulders of procurement officials presiding over systems that have few resources, limited \ncapacity, and are within weak governance environments. \n \n6.  The conventional approach to strengthening procurement may have a relatively limited \nchance of improving outcomes. In all countries, procurement practices, especially those that are \ninefficient and unfair, are fiercely defended by the entrenched and powerful forces they benefit. \nIn  the  face  of  determined  opposition,  effective  adoption  of  necessary  legal  changes  to \nprocurement practices can only be secured through an international partnership involving the \nactive support of top leaders from the public and private sectors.  \n \n7.  Good  procurement  enables  public  spending  to  develop  the  private  sector  A \ngovernment\u2019s most direct impact on the private sector is through its procurement behavior. The \ngovernment is often the largest investor and purchaser of services, especially in DMCs. The \nway it manages its commercial relations with the business community profoundly influences the \ndynamism of the private sector, and whether acceptable business practices will evolve or not. \nProcurement systems can promote competitiveness and improve the local market\u2019s ability to \nsurvive in international markets by awarding contracts on an economic basis, just as they can \npromote inefficiency and corruption by awarding contracts on the basis of personal relations or \nprivate negotiations. In this manner, a country\u2019s procurement system has a significant impact on \nnational investment rates and long-term growth rates. \n \n8.  A DMC\u2019s procurement system must be assessed for suitability in ADB-financed projects \nbefore it can be applied. In many cases, this will involve training and capacity building to bring \nthem to international standards. Initial work in this area has developed a baseline indicator \nsystem  for  measuring  the  quality  of  procurement  policies  and  institutions.4  It  offers  an \nassessment mechanism that is sufficiently flexible to be applied to differing capacity levels of \nnational,  subnational,  and  local  systems  in  different  countries.  DMCs  require  substantial \ntechnical guidance and support to sustain their medium- and long-term procurement system \nreforms. In many cases, this still requires the development of policy and regulatory frameworks, \nand  institutional  capacity  building.  ADB  will  work  together  with  the  World  Bank  to  assess \nappropriate  DMCs  and  sectors,  and  identify  and  close  the  gaps  before  applying  country \nprocurement systems in selected projects.  \n                                                 \n4  OECD/DAC  Roundtable  on  Procurement.  2005.

", "        3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will enable specific sector executing agencies (EAs) in selected DMCs to use a \ncountry procurement system in ADB-financed projects. The use of a well-designed country \nprocurement system has significant potential to increase country ownership of development \nprojects. It also improves development impact, facilitates harmonization, simplifies processes, \nand reduces project costs. Procurement systems will be assessed in cooperation with selected \nDMC governments. After mutually agreed standards, processes and monitoring, and safeguard \nmeasures are in effect; and EAs in selected sectors are properly trained, a country procurement \nsystem will be applied and tested on specific ADB-financed projects. The design and monitoring \nframework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will undertake the following key activities:  \n(i)  Conduct a diagnostics review of country procurement systems in three selected \nDMCs.  \n(ii)  Develop  specific  policy  and  capacity  improvement  recommendations,  and \nimplementing an action plan for selected DMCs and EAs on the use of country \nprocurement systems. \n(iii)  Develop ADB procedures on the use of country procurement systems. \n(iv)  Train  selected  EAs  to  apply  country  procurement  systems  for  ADB-financed \nprojects. \n(v)  Pilot-test country procurement systems for one or two projects in each of the \nthree selected countries, and monitoring the implementation in the initial stages.  \n \n11.  The  three  DMCs  will  be  selected  after  careful  consideration  of  the  joint  capacity \nassessment efforts between ADB and the World Bank, each country\u2019s commitment to improve \nits procurement system, and its willingness to fully support and cooperate with ADB under the \nscope of this project. The Central Operations Services Office (COSO) will coordinate with the \nregional departments and the World Bank on the detailed selection criteria. \n \n1.  Diagnostics Review \n12.  Before deciding whether to use a DMC\u2019s procurement system, the country procurement \nassessment report (CPAR)5 will first be used to assess the extent to which the system is \nequivalent to that of ADB. This refers to the extent to which the country\u2019s system achieves the \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s procurement and consultant guidelines and adheres to the operational \nprinciples that underlie them. In addition to the CPAR, ADB will use two systems of baseline \nindicators: a country system covering the quality of the procurement system, and a project \nsystem covering the procurement performance of the EA. An additional set of benchmarks will \ncover the country\u2019s standards for international competitive bidding (ICB).  \n \na.  Baseline Indicators \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n13.  The joint World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n(OECD)/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) procurement roundtable has developed a \n                                                 \n5  A CPAR is an analytical assessment of public procurement systems of borrowing countries. A CPAR is led by the \nWorld Bank, and in the past 4 years ADB has participated in 15 CPARs. \n ", "4   \nsystem of baseline indicators for measuring the quality of the borrower\u2019s procurement policies \nand institutional capacity. This new tool defines 12 baseline indicators, which are organized into \nfour groupings called pillars (Appendix 4). The tool is flexible enough to be applied in the very \ndiverse conditions and varying capacity levels of national, subnational, and local systems in \ndifferent countries. The indicators being refined as various stakeholders propose improvements. \nMeetings  of  the  harmonization  joint  venture  on  procurement  and  the  MDB  Heads  of \nProcurement  both  held  in  Manila  in  February  2006,  discussed  the  indicators  and  their \napplication. \n \n14.  The indicators are intended to give a broad overview of the comparative strengths and \nweaknesses of a country\u2019s procurement system. They are complex, and require professional \njudgment in arriving at a fair and objective assessment of a country procurement system. ADB, \nworking jointly with the DMC and the World Bank, will assess each indicator by comparing the \ncountry procurement system against the subindicators of the baseline. Each indicator will be \nassigned one of three ratings: not achieved, substantially achieved, and fully achieved. A DMC\u2019s \nsystem will need a \u201csubstantially achieved\u201d rating on every baseline indicator for ADB to rely on \nit. However, depending on the severity and importance of identified gaps, staff could propose \nthe use of the country\u2019s system if the rating lower than substantially achieved is not an area \ncovered by a mandatory subindicator, and ADB and DMC agree on measures to fill the gap.  \n \nb.  Performance Assessment \n15.  In a country where the baseline indicators on policy and institutional framework are \nsatisfactory, it is still necessary to examine the implementation practices, track record, and \ncapacity. Because there is already a widely accepted body of good practices in procurement, it \nis  possible  to  identify  specific  data  that  should  be  generated  and  can  be  measured  and \nmonitored to determine aspects of performance. The proposed performance indicators are \nshown in Appendix 5. During preparation of each proposed project, ADB will examine the EAs\u2019 \nprocurement track record. The assessment shall focus on a significant sample of contracts \ncovering  bidding  processes  for  ICB,  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB),  and  other  less \ncompetitive procurement methods. Overall record management, level of advertisement and \npublication of results, competitiveness of the processes, quality of the bidding process, use of \ncontract dispute resolution methods, and comparison of costs with private sector norms shall be \nevaluated. Finally, ADB will survey contractors and suppliers to determine their perception of the \nsystem\u2019s transparency and fairness. For each indicator ADB will assign a pass or fail rating and \nthen make an overall recommendation on the acceptability of the procurement system.  \n \nc.  ICB Assessment \n16.  Most aspects of a country procurement system\u2019s quality and performance assessment \napply to both ICB and NCB. However, for ICB a few additional issues are considered to be of \nprime importance in creating a reasonably level playing field and ensuring the procurement of \ngoods and services on the basis of economy, efficiency, equal opportunity, and transparency. In \nconsidering  whether  to  rely  on  a  country\u2019s  system  for  ICB,  ADB  will  assess  whether  the \ndomestic regulatory framework includes ICB provisions, and whether the provisions have been \nfollowed in a sample of contracts. ADB assigns a rating of \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d for \neach ICB indicator, based on the minimum standard shown in Appendix 5. \n \n2.  Addressing Gaps \n17.  If the results of the diagnostic review show that a country\u2019s procurement system does \nnot fully meet ADB\u2019s requirements, the review should also indicate the areas that need to be ", "        5\nimproved  and  the  specific  gaps  that  need  to  be  filled.  ADB  should  then  develop  specific \nrecommendations to help the country fill these gaps. The recommendations will be followed up \nwith an actual implementation plan, indicating that ADB will monitor its implementation and \nwhether additional ADB engagement is necessary for its implementation. Any recommendation \nreport  will  include  the  analysis  of  the  extent  a  DMC\u2019s  procurement  system  meets  ADB \nrequirements, assessment, and recommendations on the level of acceptability of the system. If \na DMC\u2019s procurement system meets ADB\u2019s requirements, then ADB will develop and implement \na training program for selected EAs in applying the country procurement system for ADB-\nfinanced  projects.  The  training  will  be  designed  in close  coordination  with  the responsible \nprocurement agencies. \n \n3.  ADB Procedures and Pilot-Testing \n18.  After  mutually  agreed  standards  and  processes  have  been  implemented,  ADB  will \ndevelop internal procedures on the use of country procurement systems in its financed projects. \nThis must first be accomplished before the testing and use of a DMC\u2019s procurement system is \nallowed. After these procedures are approved, staff in regional departments shall work closely \nwith COSO in identifying specific projects that can apply, and test the country system during \nprocurement. Following the TA completion, the procedures shall be carried out in projects where \nADB considers using the country procurement system. ADB shall retain responsibility for project \nappraisal and supervision in any project that uses a country procurement system. The decision \non the appropriate level of ADB supervision for each project shall continue to be based on a \ncomprehensive assessment that combines country, agency, and inherent project risk. Pilot-test \nprojects shall be selected based on the above assessments, as well as solid professional \njudgment on the quality and efficiency of the procurement procedures and practices.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 equivalent, $600,000 of which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Participating governments will finance \nthe remaining $100,000. The detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  COSO  will  implement  the  TA  in  consultation  with  relevant  procurement  and  sector \nagencies of selected DMCs. The TA will be implemented over 33 months beginning July 2006, \nand will require 43 person-months (16 international and 27 domestic) of consultant inputs in \npublic procurement policy, management, and capacity improvement. The consultants will be \nselected  as  a  firm  or  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. In addition to the scheduled reporting requirements, the consultant will submit a \ncomprehensive diagnostics report as well as country-specific recommendations for filling gaps. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.

Objectives \n \n1.  The conceptual approach and basic assumptions on what should constitute a sound \npublic procurement system are as follows: \n(i)  The overriding objective of a country procurement system is to achieve economy \nand  efficiency  in  the  use  of  public  funds  while  adhering  to  the  fundamental \nprinciples  of  nondiscrimination  and  equal  treatment,  due  process,  access  to \ninformation, and transparency. Performance and efficiency in procurement are \nultimately measured in transactions between public purchasers and suppliers; \nand  in  the delivery  of  the  required  goods,  works,  and services  to meet  the \ngovernment\u2019s obligations to the citizens.  \n(ii)  The  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  set  the  basic  conditions  for  the \nprocurement procedures, the results that can be expected, and the potential \nefficiency that can be achieved. Within this environment, the commitment of \npublic sector staff in managing the process, adhering to its requirements, and \ntaking advantage of the competition in the market is essential to achieve the \noverriding objectives of economy, efficiency, nondiscrimination, equal treatment, \nand transparency. \n(iii)  The legal and institutional development of any public procurement system is \nformed  by  the  prerequisites,  and guided  by a  genuine understanding  of  the \nconditions for creating a system that is efficient, transparent, and credible. Such \na  system  can  generate  efficient  and  cost-effective  procurement  in  the  best \ninterests of the contracting entities and of the country.  \nB.  Coverage of the System \n \n2.  The following four key areas, or pillars, have been identified as the basic elements of a \nnational public procurement system. Each pillar has several indicators.  \nTable A4.1: Baseline Indicators of Procurement Policies and Institutions \n \nPillar I. Legislative and Regulatory Framework \n1.

Methodological Basis for the System of Indicators \n \n3.  The indicators are intended to evaluate a procurement system at a macro level, giving a \nbroad overview of its comparative strengths and weaknesses. A simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d cannot \nanswer most of the questions, which are complex. Professional judgment is generally required \nto give an answer that assesses the national procurement system fairly and objectively against \nthe baseline. \n4.  The following sections provide details on the structure of a public procurement system, \nthe  12  indicators,  baselines  for  the  indicators,  and  methodology  for  using  the  system  of \nindicators.  It  is  anticipated  that  refinements  will  be  made  to  the  methodological  basis  as \nexperience is gained.  \nD.  System of Indicators \n \n5.  Twelve indicators, grouped under the four pillars, represent the core components of a \npublic procurement system. They are divided into subindicators for better assessment. Staff will \nassess the procurement system\u2019s achievements against the baseline for each subindicator, then \ncombine  the  subindicator  ratings  to  yield  the  indicator  rating.  There  are  two  kinds  of \nsubindicators:  \n(i)  Mandatory  subindicators,  which  cover  areas  of  such  critical  importance  that \nsatisfactory compliance is always required ex ante. \n(ii) Standard subindicators, which cover areas where compliance is required. A country \nsystem that receives a lower rating in these areas could still be used if the borrower \nand the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agree on measures to fill the gap. \n \nE.  Pillar I. Legislative and Regulatory Framework \n \n6.  The  legal  and  regulatory  framework  is  often  seen  as  the  starting  point  for  the \ndevelopment of a governance system. It sets the rules of the procurement process and provides \nthe legal basis for ensuring participants\u2019 rights and establishing their responsibilities. It is a \nfundamental element that links the procurement process to the overall governance structures \nwithin the country and defines the government\u2019s obligations in complying with internal and \nexternal requirements. \n7.  Indicator 1. The country\u2019s procurement legislative and regulatory framework complies \nwith applicable obligations deriving from national and international standards. The baseline is \ndefined by the following subindicators: \n \n(i)  Legislative  and  regulatory  framework.  The  legislative  and  regulatory \nframework is structured, consistent, and accessible to users and all interested \nstakeholders. It applies to and covers the following: (a) contracting entities at all \n ", "  Appendix 5  13 \nlevels, including government authorities, municipalities, regional authorities, and \nutilities/state-owned  enterprises  (standard  subindicator);  (b)  areas  of \nprocurement, which cover works, goods, and consulting services (mandatory \nsubindicator); and (c) all procurement using public funds, irrespective of contract \nvalue (mandatory subindicator). \n(ii)  Procurement methods. These are (a) open, competitive procurement of goods, \nworks, and services is used except in well-justified cases clearly defined in the \nlegislative and regulatory framework (mandatory subindicator); (b) international \ncompetitive tendering methods that are consistent with international standards \nare defined for specified contracts (e.g., where monetary thresholds exist) and \nare compatible with overall economy gains that can still be achieved by the public \n(mandatory subindicator); and (c) negotiated procedures and direct purchasing \nare permitted only under well-defined and well-justified circumstances, and are \nsubject to controls (mandatory subindicator). \n(iii)  Advertising  rules  and  time  limits.  These  are  (a)  accessible  publication  of \nopportunities for competitive procurement is required (mandatory subindicator); \n(b) publication of the results of contract awards based on defined thresholds is \nrequired (mandatory subindicator); and (c) minimum time limits for submission of \ntenders and applications are consistent with method of procurement, national \nconditions,  and,  when  applicable,  international  requirements  (mandatory \nsubindicator). \n(iv)  Rules  on  participation  and  qualitative  selection.  These  are  (a)  fair, \npredictable,  and  defined  rules  for  participation  rely  on  qualifications  and  the \nability  to  perform  the  requirement  (mandatory  subindicator);  (b)  use  of  price \npreferential clauses is limited and controlled. (mandatory subindicator); (c) if a \ndebarment  process  is  provided,  it  allows  due  process  and  appeal  (standard \nsubindicator); and (d) rules for participation of government-owned enterprises \nprovide equal treatment in competitive procurement (standard subindicator). \n(v)  Tender documentation and technical specifications. (a) the minimum content \nof  the  tender  documentation  is  specified  (standard  subindicator);  (b)  where \npossible,  technical  specifications  are  neutral  with  reference  to  international \nstandards  (mandatory  subindicator);  and  (c)  the  content  of  the  tender \ndocumentation is relevant to meeting requirements and process implementation \n(mandatory subindicator). \n(vi)  Submission, receipt, and opening of tenders.  (a) Tenders are opened in \npublic in a defined way that ensures the regularity of the proceedings (mandatory \nsubindicator).  (b)  There  is  a  clear  requirement  to  maintain  records  of  the \nproceedings  and  process,  and  to  make  them  available  for  review  or  audit \n(mandatory  subindicator).  (c)  Maintenance  of  security  and  confidentiality  of \ntenders before bid opening is required (mandatory subindicator). (d) Modalities \nfor  submitting  and  receiving  tender  documents  are  well  defined  (mandatory \nsubindicator). \n(vii)  Tender  evaluation  and  award  criteria.  These  are  (a)  objective,  fair,  and \npredisclosed  criteria  for  evaluation  and  award  of  contracts  (mandatory \nsubindicator); (b) a clear methodology for evaluating tenders based on price and \nother fully disclosed factors expressed in monetary terms or pass/fail criteria \n(mandatory subindicator); (c) evaluators\u2019 maintenance of confidentiality during \nthe  evaluation  process  (mandatory  subindicator);  and  (d)  complaint  review \nprocedures that provide fair, independent, and timely implementation, and allow \nthe award to be redirected, if necessary (standard subindicator). \n ", "14  Appendix 5 \n8.  Indicator  2.  The  country  has  appropriate  regulations,  documentation,  and  tools  to \nsupport implementation of its framework. \n \n9.  Implementing  procurement  regulations  must  be  available,  including  operational \nprocedures,  handbooks,  model  tender  documentation,  and  standard  conditions  of  contract. \nThey facilitate correct and consistent application of the legislative and regulatory framework as \nwell as effective procurement.  \n10.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  Implementation of regulations that provides defined processes and procedures \nnot included in higher-level legislation. \n(ii)  Model tender documents for goods, works, and services. \n(iii)  Procedures for prequalification. \n(iv)  Procedures  suitable  for  contracting  services  or  other  requirements  in  which \ntechnical capacity is a key criterion. \n(v)  User\u2019s guide or manual for contracting entities. \n(vi)  General  conditions  of  public  sector  contracts  covering  goods,  works,  and \nservices  consistent  with  national  requirements  and,  when  applicable, \ninternational requirements. \n \nF.    Pillar II. Institutional Framework and Management Capacity \n11.  Modernizing and maintaining a country\u2019s public procurement system is an ongoing and \ncomplicated  process.  It  benefits  strongly  from  the  existence  of  focal  points  within  the \ngovernment  administration  that  have  sufficient  capacity  and  qualifications  to  manage  the \nprocurement system and monitor public procurement. All bodies with legitimate interest in public \nprocurement, such as contracting entities, private sector entities, the government, and the \njudicial system, benefit from varying kinds of support. This pillar examines the institutional \ncapacity  to  oversee,  manage,  and  support  efficient  implementation  as  well  as  to  provide \nleadership in maintaining and modernizing the public procurement system. It can be used at the \nlevel of the central government but can also be adapted to look at other levels of government.  \n12.  Indicator 3. The public procurement system is mainstreamed and well integrated into \nthe public sector governance system. \n \n13.  Public procurement should be integral to a country\u2019s overall public financial management \nand  public  sector  governance  system.  A  well-functioning  procurement  system  provides \ninformation to support budget development and execution. It benefits from the public financial \nmanagement system with regard to timely appropriations and the availability of funds to support \nthe award and payments of contracts. Lack of integration between budgeting and procurement \ncan cause cancellations or render funds insufficient to make timely payments. These result in \nincreased costs and inefficiencies in the use of public funds. \n14.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  Procurement planning and data on costing are part of the budget formulation \nprocess and contribute to multiyear planning. \n(ii)  Budget  law  and  financial  procedures  support  timely  procurement,  contract \nexecution, and payment. \n ", "  Appendix 5  15 \n(iii)  Procurement  actions  are  not  initiated  until  budget  appropriations  have  been \nmade. \n(iv)  Contract execution is subject to budgetary controls to ensure sufficient funding. \n(v)  The budgeting system allows the timely release of funds to make payments \nagainst contractual obligations. \n \n15.  Indicator 4. The country has a functional normative/regulatory body.  \n \n16.  In most countries, normative bodies within the central government provide a range of \nfunctions  that  support  the  consistent  development,  maintenance,  and  application  of  the \nlegislative and regulatory requirements of a procurement system. Such bodies provide guidance \non the interpretation of rules, support training, and develop capacity. They also develop and \noversee the use of technology to support procurement, including e-procurement. Such bodies \nand their capacity are especially important in decentralized governments.  \n17.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  The  status  and  basis  for  the  normative/regulatory  body  is  covered  in  the \nlegislative and regulatory framework. \n(ii)  The body has a defined set of responsibilities that include at least the following: \nadvising  contracting  entities;  drafting  amendments  to  the  legislative  and \nregulatory  framework,  and  implementing  regulations;  monitoring  public \nprocurement; providing procurement information; managing statistical databases; \nreporting  on  procurement  to  other  parts  of  government;  developing  and \nsupporting initiatives to improve the public procurement system; and providing \nimplementing tools and documents to support training and capacity development \nof implementing staff. The responsibilities should be separate and clear to avoid \nconflict  of  interest  and  direct  involvement  in  the  execution  of  procurement \ntransactions. \n(iii)  The  body\u2019s  organization,  funding,  staffing,  and  level  of  independence  and \nauthority,  or  formal  power,  to  exercise  its  duties  should  be  sufficient  and \nconsistent with the responsibilities. \n \n18.  Indicator 5. The country has institutional development capacity. \n \n19.  The public procurement system is defined by a legislative and regulatory framework that \ncan be complex. It often requires the exercise of judgment in the application of the appropriate \nprocedures. The performance of the system relies heavily on the capacity of the participants, \nfrom the public and private sector, to understand and implement the procedures. Performance \nalso depends on the capacity of the various stakeholders who interact with the system. \n20.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  The  country  has  a  system  for  collecting  and  disseminating  procurement \ninformation,  including  tender  invitations,  requests  for  proposals,  and  contract \naward information. \n(ii)  The country should have a sustainable strategy to provide training, advice, and \nassistance to help the government and private sector participants understand \nwhat the rules and regulations are and how they should be implemented. \n(iii)  The country has systems and procedures for collecting and monitoring national \nprocurement statistics. \n ", "16  Appendix 5 \n(iv)  Quality  control  standards  are  disseminated  and  used  to  evaluate  staff \nperformance and address capacity development issues. \n \nG.  Pillar III. Procurement Operations and Market Practices \n \n21.  In a well-functioning system, an efficient and competitive private sector market is a key \npartner of the public procurement system. If the private sector market is to be effective, it must \nhave confidence in the competence of the contracting authorities at all levels to implement and \nadminister the public procurement system in accordance with the legislative and regulatory \nframework. \n22.  Indicator 6. The country\u2019s procurement operations and practices are efficient. \n \n23.  Procurement  operations  capacity  and  practices,  which  are  at  the  core  of  a  well-\nfunctioning procurement system, depend on the staffing, knowledge, skills, and capabilities of \nthe human resources. They also rely on the system incentives and controls that influence \nhuman behavior and institutional performance.  \n24.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators for contracting agencies: \n \n(i)  The level of procurement competence among government officials within the \nentity is consistent with their procurement responsibilities. \n(ii)  The procurement training and information programs for government officials and \nfor private sector participants are consistent with demand. \n(iii)  There are appropriate administrative systems for public procurement operations \nand information databases to support performance monitoring and reporting, and \nto respond to the information needs of other related government systems. \n(iv)  The entity has internal control mechanisms governing procurement operations at \nthe contracting level, including a code of conduct, separation of responsibilities \nas  a  check/balance  mechanism,  and  oversight/control  of  signature/approval \nauthority. \n(v)  There are established norms for safekeeping records and documents related to \ntransactions and contract management. \n(vi)  There are provisions for delegating authority to others who have the capacity to \nexercise responsibilities. \n \n25.  Indicator 7. The country\u2019s public procurement market functions well.  \n \n26.  Market performance depends on the capacity and depth of the country\u2019s market. \n27.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  The country\u2019s public procurement market has enough participants to provide \ndomestic competition. \n(ii)  The public sector pays prices for goods, works, and services that are comparable \nto prices paid for similar requirements in the domestic markets. \n(iii)  The  quality  and  consistency  of  the  private  sector\u2019s  submissions  to  the \ngovernment should be sufficient to allow the award and completion of contracts. \n(iv)  Bidders participate in response to competitive tender invitations at a rate that is \nconsistent with marketplace capacity. \n ", "  Appendix 5  17 \n(v)  The  private  sector  demonstrates  confidence  in  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework governing the procurement process by participating in it and using its \ncomplaint or protest mechanisms.  \n \n28.  Indicator 8. The country has contract administration and dispute resolution provisions. \n \n29.  Contract  administration,  a  key  element  in  managing  the  outputs  of  a  public  sector \nprocurement system, oversees quality and timely performance and provides early access to \ninformation that  is  needed  for  good  management.  Contract  administration  is  critical  to  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  major  public  investment  projects  and  to  the  fair  and  timely \nresolution of disputes.  \n30.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  Clear procedures for contract administration include efficient and streamlined \ninspection and acceptance procedures, quality control procedures, and methods \nto review and issue contract amendments on time. \n(ii)  Contracts include dispute resolution procedures that provide an efficient and fair \nprocess to resolve disputes that arise during the performance of the contract. \n(iii)  Procedures exist to enforce the outcome of dispute resolution. \n \nH.  Pillar IV. Integrity of the Public Procurement System  \n \n31.  A fair, transparent, and credible public procurement system has mechanisms and the \ncapacity for independent control and audit of procurement operations to provide accountability \nand compliance. Similarly, there must be a system for participants to lodge complaints and \nchallenge  decisions  with  administrative  and  judicial  review  bodies,  which  have  the \nindependence and legal power to impose corrective measures and remedies against contracting \nentities in breach of the legal and regulatory framework. To create a sound and fair environment \nfor public procurement operations, legislation and special measures should address the issues \nof fraud and corruption, including conflict of interest.  \n32.  Indicator 9. The country has effective control and audit systems. \n \n33.  Internal and external controls in implementing agencies and an effective external audit \nsystem are key elements of a governance and public financial management system. They are \nparticularly important to the effective and efficient operations of the public procurement system. \n34.  The baseline is defined by the following subindicators: \n \n(i)  A legal framework, organization, policy, and procedures for internal and external \ncontrol and audit of public procurement operations are in place to provide a \nfunctioning control framework (mandatory). \n(ii)  Enforcement  and  follow-up  on  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  control \nframework provide an environment that fosters compliance (mandatory). \n(iii)  The internal control system provides timely information on compliance to enable \nmanagement action (mandatory). \n(iv)  The internal control systems are sufficiently defined to allow performance audits \nto be conducted (standard). \n(v)  Auditors are sufficiently informed about procurement requirements and control \nsystems to conduct quality audits that contribute to compliance (standard). \n ", "18  Appendix 5 \n \n35.  Indicator 10. The country has an efficient appeals mechanism.  \n \n36.  The  appeals  mechanism,  which  includes  a  complaint  review  and  remedy  system, \ncontributes to the compliance environment and integrity of the public procurement system when \nit operates efficiently and provides unbiased decisions.  \n37.  The baseline is defined by the following standard subindicators: \n \n(i)  An  independent  complaint  review  system  gives  participants  in  the  public \nprocurement process the right to file a complaint within the framework of an \nadministrative and judicial review procedure. \n(ii)  Decisions are deliberated on the basis of available information, and the final \ndecision  can  be  reviewed  and  ruled  upon  by  an  authority  with  enforcement \ncapacity under the law. \n(iii)  The complaint review system has the capacity to handle complaints efficiently \nand has the means to enforce the remedy imposed. \n(iv)  The system operates fairly. Outcomes of decisions are balanced and justified on \nthe basis of available information, and with decisions aimed at correcting the \nprocurement  process  rather  than  compensating  for  a  loss  of  contracting \nopportunity. \n(v)  Decisions are published and made available to all interested parties and the \npublic. \n(vi)  The administrative review body or authority is independent from the regulatory \nbody, executing agency, and audit/control agency. \n \n38.  Indicator 11. The public has broad access to information. \n \n39.  In procurement, particularly in e-procurement, access to information is critical to the \nmany stakeholders in the system. Although access to information is covered under various \nbaselines, the importance of this element justifies a dedicated indicator.  \n40.  The baseline is defined by the following subindicators: \n  \n(i)  Information  must  be  published  and  distributed  through  available  media  with \nsupport from information technology, when feasible (mandatory). \n(ii)  Systems to collect key data related to performance of the procurement system \nand to report regularly are in place (standard). \n(iii)  Records must be maintained to validate data (mandatory). \n \n41.  Indicator 12. The country has ethics and anticorruption measures in place.  \n \n42.  The procurement system should be perceived to operate with integrity. It must clearly \ndefine unacceptable practices and state the consequences of engaging in fraudulent, corrupt, or \nunethical behavior. \n43.  The baseline is defined by the following subindicators: \n \n(i)  The  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  procurement,  including  tender  and \ncontract  documents,  must  include  provisions  addressing  corruption,  fraud, \nconflict of interest, and unethical behavior and set out (either directly or with \n ", "  Appendix 5  19 \nreference to other laws) the actions that can be taken regarding such behavior \n(mandatory). \n(ii)  The legal system must define responsibilities, accountabilities, and penalties for \nindividuals and firms found to have engaged in fraudulent or corrupt practices \n(mandatory). \n(iii)  Rulings and penalties must be perceived as being enforced (mandatory). \n(iv)  The  government  has  an  anticorruption  program  that  provides  and  enforces \nspecial measures to prevent and detect potential fraud and corruption in public \nprocurement in accordance with criminal laws (standard). \n(v)  Stakeholders  (the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  ultimate  beneficiaries  of \nprocurement or end users) support the creation of a procurement market known \nfor its integrity and ethical behavior (standard). \n(vi)  The country has a secure mechanism in place for reporting fraudulent, corrupt, or \nunethical behavior (standard). \n(vii)  Codes  of  conduct  or  codes  of  ethics  for  participants  in  the  public  financial \nmanagement  system  provide  a  system  for  indicating  who  is  accountable  for \nspecific decisions (standard). \n \nI.  Assessment Ratings of Baseline Indicators  \n \n44.  For  each  subindicator,  the  baseline  represents  a  desirable  good-practice  standard. \nComparing actual conditions and practices against this standard provides a profile of the system \nthat identifies strengths and weaknesses, along with a descriptive analysis that includes details \nsuch as methodology and rationale.  \n  1.  Proposed Levels of Achievement  \n \n    a.  For Rating the Subindicators \n \n45.  The  assessment  team  compares  the  borrower\u2019s  procurement  system  with  each \nsubindicator and assigns one of the following ratings: (i) satisfactory, if the borrower\u2019s system \nsatisfactorily meets all the baseline requirements for the subindicator; and (ii) not satisfactory, if \nthe  borrower\u2019s  system  does  not  satisfactorily  meet  all  the  baseline  requirements  of  the \nsubindicator. \n    b.  For Rating the Indicators \n \n46.  The  subindicator  ratings  for  each  indicator  are  combined  to  yield  a  rating  for  that \nindicator, which is determined according to the following criteria: \nTable A4.2: Rating Criteria \nIndicator Rating   Assessment key \nFully Achieved  All subindicators forming this indicator are rated satisfactory. \n(FA) \nSubstantially  All mandatory subindicators included in this indicator are rated satisfactory, and \nAchieved (SA)  at least 70% of all subindicators included in this indicator are rated satisfactory.  \nNot Achieved  Any mandatory subindicator included in this indicator is rated not satisfactory, or \n(NA)  less than 70% of all subindicators included in this indicator are rated satisfactory. \nSource: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance Committee.  \n ", "20  Appendix 5 \n \n    c.  For Rating the System (Group of Indicators) \n \n47.  The overall rating of the borrower\u2019s procurement system is based on the collective \nassessment of the 12 baseline indicators. A borrower\u2019s system needs a \u201cFully Achieved\u201d or \n\u201cSubstantially Achieved\u201d rating on every baseline indicator for ADB to rely on it. However, \ndepending on the severity and importance of identified gaps, staff members may propose the \nuse of the borrower\u2019s systems if (i) the ratings that are lower than \u201cSubstantially Achieved\u201d are in \nareas  not  covered  by  mandatory  subindicators,  and  (ii)  ADB  and  the  borrower  agree  on \nmeasures to fill the gap. \n ", "Appendix 6        21 \nPERFORMANCE AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING INDICATORS \n \n \nTable A5.1: Performance Indicators \n \nIndicator Name  Indicates  Measured by  Satisfactory Threshold \nA.
