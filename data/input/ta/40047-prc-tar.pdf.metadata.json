At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), technical \nassistance (TA) for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) development was \nincluded in the country strategy and program update 2007\u20132008.1 The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) undertook TA fact-finding in September 2006 and agreement was reached with the \nGovernment\u2014including the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and National Development and Reform \nCommission  (NDRC)  at  the  central  government  level,  and  the  provincial  governments  of \nGuangdong  and  Hunan  provinces\u2014on  the  TA\u2019s  impact  and  outcome,  outputs,  costs  and \nfinancing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe parties also agreed that the TA will focus on Guangdong and Hunan provinces as pilot \ncases. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government accords high strategic priority to developing TVET during the Eleventh \nFive-Year Program (EFYP) period (2006\u20132010) and beyond. This reflects the significant social \nand economic benefits that improved TVET can generate by helping to (i) address a range of \nmedium and long-term economic and social development issues; and (ii) build a harmonious \nsociety, which is a key objective of the EFYP.  \n \n3.  Strengthening TVET will help to address the severe shortage of skilled workers in the \nPRC. Nationally, only about 33% of all urban employed are skilled labor, with highly skilled \nworkers/technicians accounting for less than 4%. Moving up the skills ladder from lower-end \nmanufacturing  and  processing  to  high  value-added  industries  is  crucial  for  firms  to  gain \ncompetitiveness, and many firms in key areas are suffering from severe shortages of skilled \nworkers. More broadly, increasing the number of skilled workers is essential for the PRC to \nsustain high economic growth.  \n \n4.  Improved TVET will help correct structural skills mismatches in the labor market. While \nsevere skills shortages exist, it is estimated that between one quarter and one third of tertiary \ngraduates and several million secondary school graduates cannot find jobs upon graduation \neach  year.  This  indicates  a  serious  mismatch  between  labor  market  demand  and  supply. \nMaking  the  TVET  system  more  sensitive  and  responsive  to  labor  market  needs,  and \nstrengthening links between TVET and the private sector are essential measures to mitigate this \nmismatch.  In  particular,  an  effective  TVET  system  will  produce  better  suited  labor  market \nentrants, and facilitate training/retraining of those switching or in between jobs. This will improve \nthe overall effectiveness of the labor market and help to lower unemployment.2  \n \n5.  Improved TVET will also help to address the skill and employment related issues raised \nby massive rural\u2013urban migration. Over 200 million surplus laborers have migrated from rural to \nurban areas, most with limited readily employable skills. Rural\u2013urban migration on this scale is \nexpected to continue at a rate of about 10 million a year for the EFYP period and beyond. A \nstrengthened TVET system can play a vital role in enabling migrant workers to find better jobs \nwith higher and more stable income, as well as contributing to a more orderly and effective \nprocess of rural\u2013urban migration and urbanization.  \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006.

The existing TVET system in the PRC is far short of addressing these key issues and \nproducing the significant economic and social outcomes required to meet the country\u2019s medium \nand long-term development needs. Key constraints are discussed below.  \n \n7.  Inefficient TVET System. While acute skills shortages exist, what is taught and learned \nin TVET institutions often does not meet labor market needs. In Guangdong province, where \nplacement  rates  routinely  reach  over  90%,  TVET  graduates  often  lack  practical  skills  and \nhands-on experience,3 indicating that the high placement rate reflects the excess demand rather \nthan  the  quality  of  the  graduates.  Such  inefficiencies  waste  human,  financial,  and  other \neducation resources. They also reveal the underlying lack of focus of the TVET system on \nimparting employable skills and experience, and weaknesses in labor market linkages.  \n \n8.  Effective mechanisms need to be developed to improve TVET system efficiency. These \ninclude:  (i)  strengthening  labor  market  linkages  through  improved  flows  of  labor  market \ninformation;  (ii)  strengthening  links  with  employers  and  industry  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation of TVET; (iii) a curriculum and syllabus that reflect market needs, and adequate \ntime allotted for practical training; (iv) improving teacher qualification where many teachers lack \nthe technical skills, practical knowledge, and experience to teach TVET; and (v) strengthening \nschool management and providing incentives to principals and teachers to focus on education \nand training in line with market needs. Continued efficiency improvements to make TVET more \nresponsive to market needs\u2014turning out graduates with not only practical skills but also the \ncapability to learn, adapt, and solve problems\u2014is a key requirement for the education system in \nthe 21st century. Efficiency improvements are a prerequisite for further investments and capacity \nexpansion in TVET, and key to utilizing existing capacity better. \n \n9.  Resource Gaps. Existing TVET capacity is unable to meet the PRC\u2019s present and future \nneeds for skills because of years of underinvestment. The PRC has an estimated total training \ncapacity  equivalent  to  only  10%  of  its  total  number  of  workers,  against  30\u201340%  in  many \nadvanced economies. The sector also suffers from underfunding. Data from selected provinces \nshow that protracted underfunding has resulted in a lack of buildings, equipment, consumables, \nand teachers. These shortcomings have contributed to lowering the quality of TVET teaching \nand  learning,  and  hinder  its  ability  to  expand.  The  central  Government  has  earmarked \nsignificant resources (CNY10 billion) during the EFYP period for a number of national goals, \nincluding (i) increasing TVET enrolment at the senior secondary level from about 6.0 million to \n8.5 million by 2008; (ii) establishing key TVET institutions at the national, provincial, and county \nlevels; and (iii) strengthening national training programs, including one focusing on migrant \nworkers. However, given that TVET is mostly funded by local budgets, considerable financing \ngaps are expected to remain. It will be essential to explore innovative approaches to resource \nmobilization to meet the financing needs of TVET. \n \n10.  Weak  Public-Private  Partnerships  in  TVET.  While  the  private  sector  is  active  in \nproviding short-term skills and vocational training, its overall role in TVET is modest. Privately \nowned institutions account for only around 10% of all TVET. Private training agencies tend to be \nsmall,  and  concentrate  on  training  programs  that  require  less  equipment  and  have  lower \noperating costs. The Government encourages private sector participation in TVET but legal, \nadministrative, financial, and other obstacles remain which hinder the growth of private provision \nof  or  partnership  in  TVET.  Given  the  right  incentives,  it  is  in  the  best  interest  of  private \nenterprises\u2014as main direct beneficiaries\u2014to participate actively in TVET. In recent years, some \nsuccessful local examples of public-private partnerships in TVET have emerged. It is essential \n                                                 \n3 This is consistent with the findings of a recent small-scale survey of employers conducted by the ADB. \n ", "  3\nto assess these local experiences and distill what is effective and more widely applicable. It is \nalso important for the PRC to learn from good practices in enhancing public-private TVET \npartnership internationally.  \n \n11.  Migrant Workers\u2019 Lack of Job and Income Opportunities. The generally low level of \nmigrant workers\u2019 skills is a key reason why most migrant workers remain in a few low-skilled \nindustries with little prospect of upward mobility, and is an underlying cause of many social \nissues  relating  to  migrant  workers  in  urban  areas.  TVET  can  provide  improved  skills, \nknowledge, and experience for gainful urban employment. However, only about 20% of migrant \nworkers currently receive any training and most is very basic (as short as 15 days). How to \nprovide migrant workers with TVET is a key issue to be explored. Public sector assistance, \nincluding interprovincial arrangements, may be necessary to ensure that (i) training provided to \nmigrant workers in their home province be relevant to job market needs in host provinces, and \n(ii)  migrant  workers  have  easy  and  nondiscriminatory  access  to  training  and  jobs  in  host \nprovinces. This will benefit migrant workers themselves, reduce labor market transaction costs, \nand ensure that migration flows are more adequately supported.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be an effective TVET system to support employment and labor \nmarkets in the PRC. The outcome of the TA will be consideration by higher authorities of the \ncentral and selected provincial governments of key policy recommendations for improving and \nstrengthening TVET.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will review TVET in two provinces: (i) a key industrial province heavily reliant on \nmigrant labor, and (ii) a less developed central province that serves as a source of migrant \nworkers. Guangdong is among the most developed coastal provinces and faces severe skills \nshortages which constrain upgrading its manufacturing and processing into higher value-added \nindustries. The experience in Guangdong will have direct relevance for other advanced coastal \nprovinces. Hunan is a province in the central region where economic development lags behind \nthat of the costal areas. Hunan\u2019s experience and lessons in TVET development will be useful to \ncentral and western provinces with similar conditions. Hunan is also a major source of supply of \nmigrant workers to Guangdong. Working with both provinces on partnership building will enable \nthe  TA  to  take  a  broad  and  innovative  approach  to  addressing  issues  related  to  migrant \nworkers. \n \n14.  The review, analysis, and recommendations for improving TVET will be reflected in the \nmain TA report. TA outputs will include (i) key policy recommendations formulated on measures \nand mechanisms for improving TVET for Guangdong and Hunan provinces, some of which will \nhave  wider  applicability  in  the  PRC;  and  (ii)  a  publication  on  key  TA  findings  and \nrecommendations.  The  policy  recommendations  will  be  drawn  from  the  main  TA  report\u2019s \nanalysis and assessment of key issues identified and discussed (paras. 2\u201311). Policy measures \nand mechanisms identified for implementation will be costed and prioritized. Key TA findings \nand policy recommendations will be packaged as knowledge products for wide dissemination \namong stakeholders and the general public through a variety of media including websites, \nprinted materials, and at conferences.  \n ", "4   \n15.  Two  surveys  will  be  conducted  and  their  results  analyzed  early  during  TA \nimplementation. One survey will be on migrant workers\u2019 participation in TVET, with a view to \n(i) better  understanding  the  status,  issues,  and  challenges  to  more  active  participation  by \nmigrant workers in TVET; and (ii) identifying effective means and measures to provide better \njobs and income for migrant workers through TVET. The other survey will be on TVET financing, \naimed at identifying solutions to issues in mobilizing adequate resources for financing TVET, \nincluding  willingness  to  pay  on  the  demand  side,  and  ways  of  enhancing  public-private \npartnership.  \n \n16.  Four workshops and one national conference will be held. The workshops will serve as a \nvenue and platform for (i) sharing TA findings during implementation, (ii) building consensus \namong the stakeholders, and (iii) consultation and feedback. The workshops will be issues-\noriented and are tentatively scheduled to be held, separately in Guangdong and Hunan, at TA \ninception  and  midterm.  The  national  conference  will  be  held  towards  the  end  of  TA \nimplementation to (i) disseminate the TA\u2019s findings, (ii) exchange experiences and information \non TVET development within PRC and in other countries, and (iii) provide inputs for further \nrefining of the TA reports and outputs.  \n \n17.  A study visit will be conducted early during TA implementation to offer key officials (i) an \nopportunity to observe first-hand good practices in countries with successful experience of \nTVET development, and (ii) a platform for exchanging experiences and lessons learned with \nother countries. The participants will include central and provincial government officials directly \ninvolved in policy making and implementation of TVET. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution, \nestimated at $200,000 equivalent, will be in kind and cover remuneration of counterpart staff, \noffice space and meeting venues, furniture, administrative support, and logistics. Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months from January to September 2007. \nThe Bureau of Finance of Guangdong Province (BOFG) will be the Executing Agency of the TA, \nresponsible for the overall execution and coordination of TA activities. Within BOFG, a TVET \nproject group will be established with members from relevant agencies including the Provincial \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, Bureau of Education, and Bureau of Labor and Social \nSecurity. A key responsibility of BOFG is to coordinate closely and cooperate with Hunan \nProvince. The Bureau of Finance of Hunan Province (BOFH) will be the Implementing Agency \nof the TA, responsible for the effective implementation of the TA activities to be carried out in \nHunan. Within BOFH, a TVET project group will be established with members from Provincial \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (PDRC), Bureau of Education (BOE), Bureau of Labor \nand Social Security (BOLSS), and other relevant agencies. A key responsibility of BOFH is to \ncoordinate closely and cooperate with BOFG. \n \n20.  BOFG and BOFH will be responsible for providing information, coordination/liaison, and \nother conditions necessary for the consultants to complete their tasks successfully\u2014including \nsuitably furnished office space with utilities and telecommunication access; and materials, data, \nand  documents  required  by  the  TA.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  TA  activities  in  their \n ", "  5\nrespective provinces, BOFG and BOFH will each appoint a provincial project coordinator who \nwill be responsible for liaising and coordinating within their respective provinces, between the \ntwo provinces, and with ADB and the consultant team. ADB will establish an advance payment \nfacility with the BOFG and BOFH to facilitate timely implementation of the TA in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants. \n \n21.  A national project steering committee will provide overall guidance and coordination, \nincluding interprovincial and interagency coordination, to ensure effective and timely project \nimplementation. The project steering committee will be chaired by a representative from MOF, \nwith members from NDRC, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Labor and Social Security, and \nwill meet as needed. \n \n22.  A team of international and national consultants will be engaged for a total of 34 person-\nmonths (6 person-months from 1 international consultant and 28 person-months from 6 national \nconsultants)  in  the  fields  of  sector  planning  and  development,  TVET  sector  reform  and \ndevelopment,  private  sector  participation,  TVET  financing  and  resource  mobilization,  labor \nmarket linkages, and TVET for migrant workers. In addition to policy and sector expertise, the \nconsultants will have experience on issues specific to Guangdong and/or Hunan provinces. The \ninternational consultant will be the team leader and one national consultant will be the deputy \nteam leader. The team leaders will be responsible for the quality and timely delivery of all TA \ndeliverables and outputs, including the inception, midterm, and draft final TA reports; as well as \nfinalizing key TA recommendations in a knowledge product prior to TA completion.  \n \n23.  The consultants, including the implementation of an overseas study visit to be funded \nunder the TA, will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. TA reports prepared by the consultant will be presented in English and \nChinese. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
