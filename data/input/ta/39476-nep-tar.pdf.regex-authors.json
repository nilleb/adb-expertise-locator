The Government of Nepal is regarded as a leader in the implementation of managing \nfor development results (MfDR) in the South Asia region since it has taken concrete steps in \ndeveloping some core elements of results-based management while implementing its Tenth \nFive Year Plan (FYP, FY2003\u2013FY2007)1, which is also the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction \nStrategy (PRS), and the Three Year Interim Development Plan (TYIDP, FY2008\u2013FY2010). The \nresults frameworks of the Tenth FYP, TYIDP, Medium Term Expenditure Framework, and \nsector business plans are important tools in aligning resources with expected results. Project \nprioritization  criteria  introduced  since  the  Tenth  FYP  has  helped  curb  the  number  of \ndevelopment projects and focus resource allocations to priority sectors that better contribute to \npoverty reduction goals. The Poverty Monitoring Division of the National Planning Commission \n(NPC)  has  been  regularly  monitoring  progress  towards  achieving  the  PRS.  The  poverty \nmonitoring  and  analysis  system  (PMAS)  and  the  district  poverty  monitoring  and  analysis \nsystem (DPMAS) have been developed to facilitate the monitoring of development interventions \nand their national and local impact. Together with other development partners, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has helped the Government implement the Tenth FYP through its \ncountry strategy and program (CSP, 2005\u20132009)2 which is also ADB\u2019s first results-based CSP.  \n \n2.  In  2005,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  support  the  capacity  development  of \ngovernment institutions to operationalize MfDR. Accordingly, between 2006 and 2008, two \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects3 were implemented to support the introduction of MfDR in \nthe NPC, three pilot agencies of the central government (the Ministry of Physical Planning and \nWorks [MPPW], the Ministry of Local Development [MLD], and the Ministry of Education and \nSports [MOES]), and four district development committees (Dang, Dhanusha, Jhapa,  and \nJumla). In 2007, the Government requested additional technical support to consolidate the \nachievements of the two TA projects and to extend MfDR approaches to other government \nagencies. ADB confirmed an advisory TA project in its 2008 country assistance program. The \nFact-Finding Mission on 3\u201318 June 2008 gathered inputs on the TA scope and design, and met \nwith  government  agencies,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders.  It  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  costs  and  financing, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  counterpart  support.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005)5 sets out an ambitious international \nagenda to improve aid practices and effectiveness, and is designed to help developing countries \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Central to this agenda is that all countries and \ndonors should improve their management of resources to achieve better, verifiable development \nresults, guided by a commitment to mutual accountability. The 2006 Asian Regional Forum on \nAid Effectiveness agreed that the Paris Declaration was relevant and important for increasing \n                                                 \n1  Government of Nepal. 2003. Tenth Five Year Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2007). Kathmandu. \n2  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009). Manila. \n3  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Government of Nepal for Operationalization of Managing for Development \nResults.  Manila  (TA  4765-NEP,  approved  on  13  February);  and  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  for \nMainstreaming Managing for Development Results in Support of Poverty Reduction in South Asia. Manila (TA \n6306-REG, approved on 27 January).   \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 May 2008. \n5  The Paris Declaration was the culmination of deliberations and discussions at the Second High-Level Forum on Aid \nEffectiveness held in Paris in March 2005. \n ", "2     \nthe impact of aid in reducing poverty and inequality, increasing growth, capacity development, \nand accelerating achievement of the Millennium Development Goals across the region. It also \nconcluded that the experience and skills on MfDR approaches and practices was inadequate in \nsector agencies of development member countries. ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \n(2008\u20132010)6 for  Nepal  recommended  significant  strengthening  of  Government  efforts  to \nimplement  MfDR,  focusing  more  on  longer-term  development  outcomes  and  impacts, \nparticularly at the sector and local levels, for which long-term institutional and human capacity \ndevelopment is needed.  \n \n4.  The Government has taken a number of steps to develop some core elements of MfDR. \nIt  has  established  an  MfDR  framework  and  put  in  place  mechanisms  that  link  planning, \nbudgeting,  project  and/or  program  implementation,  and  monitoring  to  development  results \n(outputs and outcomes). The Nepal PRS, Immediate Action Plan, Medium Term Expenditure \nFramework, PMAS, DPMAS, and project performance information system are core elements of \nthe Government\u2019s MfDR process. However, these elements need to be integrated, streamlined, \nand institutionalized within an MfDR framework at all levels of the Government.  \n \n5.  With TA support provided by ADB, operationalization of MfDR has been piloted in NPC, \nMPPW, MOES, MLD, and four district development committees. This included (i) readiness \nand/or status assessments, (ii) development of results frameworks with indicators and business \nplans, (iii) capacity-development programs, (iv) development of project prioritization guidelines \nfor NPC and a manual on operationalizing MfDR in central ministries, (v) strengthening of \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  systems,  and  (vi)  implementation  of  DPMAS.7 However,  MfDR \nawareness, capacity and utilization of results-based tools, and information are still at a very \nearly stage of development in Nepal. Substantially more time is required to ensure that MfDR \ntools and approaches are actually put to use. The tools and techniques also need to be refined \nand modified as they are put to use. The pilot ministries and NPC have requested additional \nsupport to further internalize the MfDR tools and approaches\u2014for example, the business plans \nand results frameworks will need to be linked to the annual budget, and they will need to be \nintegrated into the design of key projects and programs. MfDR capacity development by its very \nnature is a long-term prospect; therefore, further support will be essential to consolidate past \nachievements and institutionalize an MfDR culture.  \n \n6.  The Government approved the TYIDP in December 2007, which consists of a policy \nand result matrix with sectoral result frameworks. The TYIDP has explicitly endorsed MfDR \nsince  it  declares  that  \"process  will  be  started  to  institutionalize  MfDR  at  all  levels  of \ndevelopment  process\". The  Nepal Portfolio  Performance  Review,  conducted  jointly  by  the \nGovernment,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  the  World  Bank,  and  ADB  in \nSeptember 2007, has agreed to prepare results frameworks in six major sectors and strengthen \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132009). Manila. \n7 TA  4765-NEP  supported  operationalization  of  MfDR  in  NPC,  MLD,  MPPW,  and  three  district  development \ncommittees through improvements to results-based log frames and business plans, the link between planning and \nbudgeting,  development  of  baseline  data  for  performance  indicators,  and  strengthening  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation. Capacity development included internal and external training programs for key personnel in both central \nand district offices. TA 6306-REG completed MfDR readiness assessment of two ministries (MPPW and MOES), \none department (Drinking Water and Sewerage) and one district development committee using seven variables \n(operating  environment;  clarity  of  mandate,  purpose,  and  results;  adequacy  of  resources;  management \ninfrastructure; values and culture; vision and leadership; and monitoring mechanisms). The main weaknesses were \nidentified in the operating environment, adequacy of resources, clarity of results, and monitoring mechanisms. The \nregional TA focused on creation of a learning culture and supported capacity development. In addition, organization \nresults chains were developed for all the agencies, management information systems were enhanced in MPPW \nwith provision of new equipment and networking, and capacity-development programs were organized.       \n ", "      3 \nmonitoring and reporting at the central level and line ministries. While results frameworks have \nbeen developed in three line ministries (MPPW, MLD, and MOES) with ADB assistance, the \ndevelopment of other ministry results frameworks will require substantive and long-term support.  \n \n7.  As part of its MfDR initiatives, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has piloted small-scale \nperformance-based budgeting in its tax and custom offices and is now planning to introduce \nresults-based budgeting in public sector agencies that are directly responsible for delivery of \npublic goods and services. Based on the learning and experiences of the pilots, MOF intends to \ndevelop policies and programs to implement results-based budgeting on a wider scale. Long-\nterm institutional and human capacity development will be essential to institutionalize results-\nbased budgeting in public sector management. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The intended impact of the TA is improved development effectiveness and poverty \nreduction through adoption of MfDR approaches in public sector management. Its outcome is \nthe operationalization of MfDR approaches and practices in selected public sector agencies. \nThe TA will help the Government (i) internalize MfDR approaches in NPC, MPPW, MLD, and \nMOES,  building  on  the  achievements  of  previous  support;  (ii)  operationalize  MfDR  in  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) and Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR); \n(iii) develop a results-based budgeting system in two public sector agencies; and (iv) build \ncapacity on MfDR.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be implemented through extensive consultations with related Government \nagencies to ensure their active participation and contribution. In addition, close coordination will \nbe maintained with other development partners that are supporting the Government\u2019s MfDR \ninitiatives.8 The TA will have four components.  \n \n10.  Internalization of MfDR Approaches in NPC, MPPW, MLD, and MOES. MfDR tools \nand techniques\u2014such as results frameworks and indicators, business plans, guidelines on \nproject prioritization, and a manual on MfDR operationalization\u2014have been developed by NPC \nand the pilot ministries with previous ADB support. The TA will help create a management \nculture focused on results by supporting the internalization of these MfDR approaches in NPC, \nMPPW, MLD, and MOES. Support for MfDR internalization will include (i) assessing the specific \nneeds and priorities of MPPW, MLD, and MOES;9 (ii) helping the pilot ministries revise their \nresults framework, indicators, and business plans in line with the TYIDP and the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  priorities;  (iii)  developing  an  action  plan  to  integrate  results  frameworks  and \nbusiness  plans  into  the  planning,  budgeting,  project  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems, and supporting its implementation during the budget cycle; (iv) assisting \n                                                 \n8  Other donor agencies\u2019 support on operationalization of MfDR include the Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s \nongoing support on monitoring and evaluation system and United Nations Development Programme\u2019s planned \nproject  on  inclusive  planning  and  monitoring  systems  for  achievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goals. \nTherefore, ADB\u2019s proposed TA will not cover strengthening of the government\u2019s monitoring system, including the \nDPMAS. The TA, however, will closely coordinate with the two projects during implementation.    \n9  MLD, for instance, has requested support on (i) linking of the business plan to the budgeting and monitoring \nprocess, and (ii) mainstreaming MfDR in its national Local Governance and Community Development Support \nProgram. \n ", "4     \nNPC to streamline and reformulate results-based management principles in its project entry and \nsupervision system; (v) enhancing the capacity of staff and institutions to mainstream MfDR in \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  processes;  and  (vi)  creating  organizational \nunderstanding and appreciation of MfDR by organizing workshops and seminars.   \n \n11.  Operationalization  of  MfDR  in  MOWR  and  MOAC.  Based  on  the  learning  and \nexperiences of the previous TA projects, operationalization of MfDR in MOAC and MOWR10 will \nbe supported by undertaking a status assessment (using ADB's MfDR readiness assessment \ntool)11 and  developing  comprehensive  results  frameworks,  results  indicators,  and  business \nplans, which will be mainstreamed into the planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems. The \nbusiness plans will be linked to the sectoral results framework of the TYIDP. The business plan \nas a strategic management tool will clarify thematic priorities and budgetary allocation and \nprovide a basis for developing performance indicators, performance contracts, and performance \nmeasures. The results framework will present a logical relationship among outputs, outcomes, \nand  strategic  development  goals.  Extensive  stakeholder  consultation  will  be  undertaken  in \ndefining results, assessing risks, identifying indicators, and reviewing reporting mechanisms.  \n \n12.  Development of a Results-Based Budgeting System. Results-based budgeting (RBB) \naims to shift the focus of budgeting from internal control and inputs to efficiency and outcomes. \nThe TA will support MOF to pilot RBB in two government agencies that are directly engaged in \npublic service delivery. Potential agencies indicated by MOF include the Transport Management \nOffice and the Traffic Management Office (of Nepal Police). The TA will assist the Government \nto develop criteria to assess the readiness of agencies for the implementation of RBB (using \nADB's MfDR readiness assessment tool) and also facilitate the selection of the pilot agencies, \neither the two mentioned above or other viable ones. The TA, in close collaboration with MOF \nand pilot agencies, will develop implementation modalities, which will include key results areas \nand monitorable performance indicators on service delivery that are organization-specific. The \nTA will support the implementation of the two pilots, as well as monitor and publicize the results \nof the pilots.  \n \n13.  Building  Capacity  on  MfDR.  For  effective  institutionalization  of  MfDR,  a  pool  of \nspecialists with enhanced skills and capability on MfDR tools and processes needs to be \ndeveloped in government agencies. The TA will (i) undertake a needs assessment of the level \nof understanding and competency on MfDR in the pilot agencies, and (ii) design capacity-\ndevelopment  programs.  Seminar,  workshops  and  training  programs  will  be  organized  to \nenhance  knowledge  and  awareness  of  MfDR  at  the  strategic  management  level,  and  to \nenhance competency and skills in using MfDR tools and techniques at the operational levels. \nThe capacity-development programs will remove widespread misunderstandings as well as lack \nof conceptual clarity of MfDR among senior managers and at the operational level. In addition, \ntraining-of-trainers programs will be organized to disseminate MfDR concepts and skills to \npublic sector managers.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide the equivalent of \n$100,000 to finance part of the local currency costs for counterpart staff, office facilities, facilities \n                                                 \n10 The two line ministries have been selected after consultation with NPC and MOF.     \n11 ADB's MfDR readiness assessment tool can be accessed at http://www.mfdr-readiness.org \n ", "      5 \nfor seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  NPC will implement the TA as the executing agency (EA). The chief of the Poverty \nMonitoring Division will be the project director and will be responsible for directing project \nimplementation,  evaluating  and  endorsing  capacity-development  programs,  supervising  and \nmonitoring consultants\u2019 outputs, coordinating with other TA implementing agencies and relevant \ndonor partners, and facilitating the reporting by the consultants to the steering committee. NPC \nwill implement the TA through MPPW, MLD, MOES, MOF, MOAC, and MOWR. The pilot \nministries and agencies will appoint a senior official as the focal point to facilitate and coordinate \nthe implementation of the TA; in addition, the focal points will organize an MfDR group within the \nministry to widen engagement of staff in TA activities. The Government will establish a steering \ncommittee chaired by the NPC vice-chair to provide overall guidance on TA implementation. \nThe  membership  will  comprise  secretaries  of  ministries  that  are  implementing  the  TA,  a \nrepresentative of MOF, and the project director, who will also function as its member secretary.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  2  years  from  February  2009  to  February  2011. \nConsulting services required for the TA include (i) 20 person-months from an MfDR expert as \nteam leader (intermittent service to be spread over 24 months) and (ii) 30 person-months from \ntwo MfDR specialists (18 person-months of intermittent input spread over 24 months, and 12 \nperson-months  of  intermittent  input  over  18  months).  All  consultants  will  have  extensive \nexperience in implementing MfDR in public sector organizations. A national consulting firm will \nbe selected using the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time); the distribution of \nweight to technical (bio-data technical proposal) and financial proposals will be 80:20. Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will submit (i) an \ninception report within 1.5 months after the TA starts, (ii) a progress report every 4 months, (iii) \na draft final report after the core TA activities are completed, and (iv) a final report after the \nGovernment\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  comments  are  incorporated.  The  consultants  will  provide  all  the \nreports to the EA (eight copies) and ADB (two copies), and organize a final workshop to \ndisseminate the experiences and learning of the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA will provide limited equipment to selected pilot agencies. The equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). All equipment will be retained by the agencies that are using them upon TA completion. \nThe TA will support short-term training programs on MfDR concepts, tools, and application in \npublic sector undertakings within the region for staff directly engaged in its implementation. The \nselection of institutions and individual participants will be based on the criteria recommended in \nthe  consultant's  capacity-development  program.  Upon  completion  of  external  training,  the \ntrainees will submit a comprehensive report on the training\u2019s relevance and achievements to the \nheads of their organization, with a copy to MOF and ADB.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Strengthening Capacity for Managing for Development Results, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Reporting   \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       Assumptions \nImproved  \u2022 Better achievements of  \u2022 Annual progress  \u2022 The Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  development results by  reports on TYIDP  commitment to adopt MfDR \neffectiveness and  government projects and  \u2022 Annual reports of  approaches in public sector \npoverty reduction  programs  line ministries  management \nthrough adoption of  \u2022 Enhanced MfDR capacity and  \u2022 Household income  \u2022 Commitment from \nMfDR approaches    accountability for results in  and expenditure  leadership of NPC and line \n  government agencies   survey  ministries to enhance \n\u2022 Improved public service  \u2022 Joint review reports  capacity on MfDR and \ndelivery   (donors and the  improve performance  \n  Government)  Risks \n  \u2022 ADB evaluation  \u2022 Government's commitment \n  mission   on MfDR falters \n  \u2022 Political instability negates \ndevelopment agenda \n\u2022 Ineffective resource use, or \ninability  to  make  use  of \nresources, by line ministries \n \nOutcome     Assumptions \nMfDR approaches  \u2022 Provision made for  \u2022 Government  \u2022 NPC and line ministries \nand practices  Government directives on  circulars and  remain committed to \noperationalized in  MfDR   notifications  adoption of MfDR  \nselected public  \u2022 Improved results orientation in  \u2022 NPC/MOF\u2019s directive  \u2022 Line ministries try to absorb \nsector agencies    planning, budgeting, and  on results based  and apply the capacity-\n  monitoring systems of five  planning and  development outcomes \nministries   budgeting   \u2022 Close guidance and \n\u2022 Increase in projects screened  \u2022 Approved results  supervision provided by the \nand approved using results  frameworks,  steering committee \ncriteria by NPC   business plans, and  \u2022 Regular ADB review \n\u2022 Better links between NPC,  indicators  Risks \nMOF, and line ministries on  \u2022 TA review progress  \u2022 Weak  support  from \nresults management   \u2022 Steering committee  leadership of line ministries  \n  meeting minutes  \u2022 Ineffective resource use, or \n  \u2022 Survey reports on  inability  to  make  use  of \nservice delivery  resources, by line ministries \n  \u2022 Slow  response  to  issues \narising  in  the  process  of \nMfDR implementation  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
