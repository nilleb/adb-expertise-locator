THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia,  during  the  country  programming  mission  held  in \nUlaanbaatar in April 2019, requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a lending \nsupport to prepare the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (Phase 2). The ensuing loan is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021 and the proposed \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) is included in ADB\u2019s nonlending pipeline for 2020.1 \n \n2.  Mongolia has a small but growing tourism sector. Government plans to expand the sector \nare focused on nature-based tourism in protected areas (which encompass 21% of Mongolia\u2019s \narea) and cultural heritage. The project will support the development of sustainable tourism within \nthree aimags (provinces) of western Mongolia, Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, and Uvs. The project will have \nfour outputs: (i) inclusive planning and capacity for local tourism businesses enhanced; (ii) \nenabling infrastructure for tourism constructed; (iii) sanitation and waste management improved; \nand (iv) management of cultural heritage sites and protected areas strengthened. These outputs \nwill result in the following outcome: sustainability and inclusiveness of ecotourism in western \nMongolia increased. The project outputs will strengthen the institutional framework for tourism \nplanning and increase the number of local beneficiaries from tourism; establish a tourism center \nin Uvs Aimag and a rock art and research center in Khovd Aimag, including Mongolia\u2019s first \u2018digital \nmuseum\u2019 for rock art; and install small management facilities at selected cultural heritage sites \nand protected areas e.g., fee collection stations, information signs, elevated walkways, and low-\ncost, gender-sensitive toilets. The designs will also address two cross-cutting issues: (i) recovery \nof the local tourism sector from the coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) and measures to \nstrengthen the sector from the risk of future disease outbreaks, and (ii) adaptation and/or \nmitigation measures to address the potential impacts of climate change (including extreme floods, \nstorms, and harsh winters) to the project structures as well as visitor safety. \n \n3.   The ensuing project will be implemented over 6 years and is estimated to cost $30.3 \nmillion, of which ADB is requested to finance $30.0 million through a project loan. A $2.0 million \ncofinanced grant will be processed in parallel with the loan.2 The central and local governments \nwill provide in-kind contribution equivalent to $0.3 million. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The executing agency, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), has limited \ntechnical and financial resources to implement the ADB requirements for loan preparation. The \ntransaction TA will help the government prepare a project design that complies with the ADB \nrequirements and international best practice.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.

Cost and Financing \n \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $0.85 million, of which $0.80 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1. \n \n7.

The MET will be the executing agency. The Department of \nTourism Policy Coordination (DTPC) of MET will be the implementing agency for the loan and the \nDepartment of Protected Area Management (DPAM) will be the implementing agency for the \ngrant. The DTPC will coordinate MET and local government support for project preparation. A \nmultisector steering committee chaired by MET will provide guidance to the project. The DTPC \nand the DPAM will nominate key focal points that will support the daily TA coordination, including \nfacilitation of meetings and site visits and timely government review and feedback on the draft \nproject designs. The governments of Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd and Uvs aimags will each assign a \nproject focal point, who will coordinate with the executing and implementing agencies and TA \n ", "3 \nconsulting firm for the fieldwork and stakeholder consultations.
