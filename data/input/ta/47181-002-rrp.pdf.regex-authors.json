THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Water Resources \nManagement  in  Pyanj  River  Basin  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a grant and technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) for the project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the JFPR grant and \nTA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project addresses issues of water resources management (WRM) at river \nbasin, water supply, and water user levels in the Pyanj River basin (PRB) in southern Tajikistan. \nThe project will improve the government\u2019s WRM capacity in the PRB, and increase agricultural \nproduction, food security, and water supply and use efficiencies in the Chubek Irrigation System \n(CIS).2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Sector Overview \n3.  Agriculture accounts for about 25% of Tajikistan\u2019s gross domestic product and export \nrevenues, and 39% of tax revenues. Tajikistan is the country in Central Asia most vulnerable to \nfood  insecurity,  given  limited  productive  irrigated  land  (which  accounts  for  95%  of  crop \nproduction)  and  underdeveloped  agriculture,3 as  well  as  poor  rural\u2013urban  connectivity  and \nlimited community resilience to climate-induced shocks. Agricultural land, which accounts for \n25% of the country\u2019s total land area, has declined since independence in 1991. In 2010, less \nthan 20% of agricultural land was classified as arable. Cultivated land per capita is 0.1 hectares \n(ha), the smallest in Central Asia. Forty five percent of the country\u2019s employment and 57% of all \nrural employment is still in agriculture. Forty seven percent of the population are living on less \nthan $1.33 per day. Almost 80% of the country\u2019s working poor live in rural areas and half of the \nworking poor are in agriculture, where they receive low wages.4  \n \n4.  Irrigation  is  critical  for  agricultural  development,  food  security,  and  economic \nadvancement. The total area developed for irrigation is about 748,000 ha. However, the actual \nirrigated area including areas with poor irrigation and drainage (I&D) conditions is estimated at \n700,000 ha because of deteriorating I&D infrastructure, salinization, waterlogged soils, and state \nauthorities\u2019 limited capacities and resources, as well as low capacities of farm management and \nwater use. The agency responsible for irrigation estimated in 2012 that all interfarm canals and \nmore than one-third of pump stations required major rehabilitation, and there was more than \n53,000 ha of land with unsatisfactory ameliorative status because of deteriorated drainage \nsystems. Coupled with limited farm inputs, this has resulted in low agricultural productivity in \nTajikistan. For example, yields of major crops (2.2 tons [t] per ha for wheat, 1.7 t/ha for cotton) \nare significantly lower than in Uzbekistan (4.5 t/ha for wheat, 2.3 t/ha for cotton).   \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2014.

Climate Change Impacts \n \n5.  Tajikistan is considered highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. \nClimate scenarios indicate that Tajikistan will experience temperature increase of up to 2\u00b0 \nCelsius by 2050, which will lead to increased crop water demand. It will also lead to accelerated \nglacial  retreat,  with  glacial  extent  expected  to  decline  by  50%  during  2010\u20132050.5 Peak \nseasonal runoff is expected to shift from early spring to late winter.6 These changes will also \nhave significant consequences for food security and rural livelihoods.  \n \n6.  Among Central Asian countries, Tajikistan has the second lowest level of total actual \nrenewable water resources per capita (Uzbekistan has the lowest). From 1990 to 2004, annual \ndiversions from surface and groundwater declined from 13.7 cubic kilometers (km3) to 12.3 km3 \nand water delivered declined from 12.0 km3 to 9.0 km3. This resulted in a decrease of water \ndelivery efficiency from 88% to 75%.7 These decreases are attributed to the deteriorating WRM \ninfrastructure (particularly I&D, as 91% of diverted water has been used for irrigation), and the \nweak operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity of WRM institutions.  \n \n7.  The government has prioritized efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of \nWRM and agriculture production. It targets the improvement of irrigated agriculture covering \n320,000 ha and the creation of 1,500 ha of irrigated land to achieve an increase of 7% in the \nvalue of agricultural products by 2015 to meet national food demand. To achieve these targets, \nthe government calls for $262 million for better WRM and $24 million for better agriculture \ninvestment.8 Identified significant gaps against targets were restated in the  strategy of the \nAgency of Land Reclamation and Irrigation (ALRI).9  \n \n8.  The government is also reforming WRM.10 The Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water \nResources was abolished in 2013 and its responsibilities were reassigned to the newly formed \n(i) Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR), responsible for the policy and regulations \non WRM; and (ii) the ALRI, responsible for the development and O&M of WRM infrastructure. \nFurther reforms include (i) the change in WRM areas from territorial administrative areas to \nhydrological areas; and (ii) the establishment of (a) river basin management (RBM) plans to \nclarify and monitor water allocations; and (b) water governance institutes such as river basin \norganizations,  which  will  draft  RBM  plans,  and  river  basin  councils,  which  will  provide  a \nparticipation mechanism for water users to approve RBM plans.   \n \n3.  Pyanj River Basin Overview \n \n9.  The PRB is the largest river basin in the country. The mountain massifs that define the \nbasin feature glaciers and permanent snowfields at elevations above 3,500 meters, and have \nhigh-density drainage networks of steep alpine streams delivering runoff and sediment rapidly to \nthe alluvial fan. The PRB\u2019s WRM will affect the country\u2019s economy as it (i) covers the majority of \nKhatlon province, which has the largest population (2.7 million) and agriculture production (e.g., \n774,000 t of cereal production) in the country, (ii) includes the most food-insecure zone among \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

Annual  river flows  are  likely  to \nincrease in the glacial sub-basins between 2015 and 2065 or 2075 because of increased melt \ncaused by higher air temperatures. The expected change in monthly flow rates due to increased \nrainfall and decreased snowfall may entail an increase in the magnitude and frequency of \nextreme flood events. Also, a gradual shift in the river flow seasonal distribution and increase in \nirrigation water requirements are predicted (footnote 6).  \n \n10.  The Pyanj River forms the boundary of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Given that more than \n40%  of  the  PRB  comprises  the  territory  of  Afghanistan  and  serious  flood  disasters  have \noccurred  frequently,  in  2010  both  governments  signed  a  bilateral  agreement  for  joint \nhydrological monitoring of the Pyanj River. A plan to establish a joint PRB commission was \ndrafted  in  2013  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance.13 The  government  has \nrequested ADB support to establish and implement the joint commission. \n \n11.  The project is consistent with the priorities of ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy for \n2016\u20132020, which recommends the allocation of 15% of ADB\u2019s available resources to climate \nchange  adaptation,  WRM,  and  food  security.  The  project  is  included  in  the  ADB  country \noperations business plan for 2016\u20132018.14 ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 highlighted \nthe promotion of food security and agricultural productivity.15 The project reflects the following \nlessons from a previous ADB-financed irrigation project: (i) projects dispersed over a broad \ngeographic  area  have  high  administrative  burdens,  and  (ii)  improving  on-farm  agricultural \nproductivity  and  ensuring  sufficient  funds  through  water  use  levies  and/or  government \ncontributions are crucial for the project\u2019s sustainability and water users\u2019 associations (WUAs).16  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project impacts, which are aligned with government strategies (footnotes 9 and 10) \nwill be the following: (i) irrigated land in good condition and food security increased by 2021, and \n(ii)  efficiency  of  water  resource  use  increased  by  2021.  The  outcome  will  be  increased \nagricultural production in the CIS area of the PRB.  \n \n13.  Among irrigation systems in the PRB, which cover about 120,000 ha, the CIS is the \nlargest (50,160 ha). The maximum water supply of the system declined to around 80 cubic \nmeters (m3) per second in 2013, compared to its design capacity of 150 m3 per second in 1950 \nbecause of system deterioration. This is attributed to sediment deposition and poor O&M (about \n460,000 m3 of sediment enters the CIS main canal from the Pyanj River every year), which has \nresulted in a decrease of the actual irrigated area to 43,210 ha, overall irrigation efficiency to \n30%, and low crop yields (e.g., wheat yield of 2.96 t/ha and cotton yield of 2.05 t/ha). While \nagriculture in the CIS area is dependent on wheat and cotton which account for 39% (wheat) \nand 36% (cotton) of the cultivated area, profitable crops (e.g., vegetables and fruit) account for \nonly 16%, which is less than in other regions (footnote 16).      \n \n                                                \n11 World Food Programme. 2013.

This output under \nthe JFPR TA includes improving the WRM system in the Tajikistan portion, and effective joint \nregional management of the PRB. The first component is in line with the ongoing water sector \nreform  and  will  (i)  establish  and  manage  river  basin  organizations,  (ii)  help  river  basin \norganizations  draft  an  RBM  plan,  and  (iii)  facilitate  the  forming  of  river  basin  councils.  In \naddition,  the  capacity  of  MEWR\u2019s  local  staff  and  staff  of  river  basin  organizations  will  be \nstrengthened for accurate measurement and recording of diverted water flows at key sections \nalong the Pyanj River (at present, the actual flow of the CIS main canal is 63% of recorded flow) \nand for appropriate data processing. The second component will help (i) draft the agreement to \nform  the  joint  PRB  commission,  its  institutional  structure  and  implementation  plan,  and \nregulations  on  administrative  and technical  operational  procedures;  (ii)  establish  a  working \ngroup  to  review  the  draft  agreement;  (iii)  facilitate  consultations  with  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan; and (iv) strengthen the commission\u2019s capacity to implement the agreement.17 The \nstrengthening capacity of hydro-meteorological monitoring and forecasting will also contribute to \nthe output, and it may be added subject to fund availability.   \n \n15.  Output  2:  Modernized  and  climate-proofed  Chubek  Irrigation  System  water \nresources management infrastructure fully operational. This includes (i) modernization and \nrehabilitation of I&D infrastructure and its  climate proofing, (ii) construction of a sediment-\nexcluding  basin,  (iii)  modernization  and  rehabilitation  of  pumping  units,  and  (iv)  capacity \ndevelopment of ALRI staff. The first component will cover the Chubek main canal including head \nregulator, escape structure, cross regulators, offtake structures, and interfarm and on-farm I&D \ncanals and associated structures. The sediments along the main and interfarm canals will be \nremoved by ALRI using machinery to be procured under the project, while WUAs and farmers \nwill  remove  the  sediment  along  on-farm  I&D  canals.  The  capacities  of  canals  have  been \nchecked against the climate change risks anticipated during the next 50 years and augmented \nwhere  required.  With  modernization  and  rehabilitation,  irrigation  conveyance  efficiency  will \nincrease from the present 60% to 66% for gravity-fed systems and 82% for pump-fed systems. \n \n16.  The second component will reduce the CIS O&M requirements by hydraulically flushing \naround 70% of total sediment entering the main canal and mechanically removing around 15%. \nUnder the third component, two cascade pump systems (Urtaboz covering 5,700 ha and Janubi \ncovering 2,600 ha) out of four systems covering 14,344 ha will be modernized and rehabilitated. \nEnergy efficiency of target pump units will increase from less than 50% at present to more than \n75%. In addition, a feasibility study will explore alternative cost-efficient water supply methods \nfor  the  irrigated  area  under  nontargeted  pump  systems.  Under  the  fourth  component,  the \ncapacities of local ALRI offices, including the WUA support unit, will improve to perform their \nduties (e.g., water and sediment flow monitoring and recording, monitoring and evaluation \n[M&E] of irrigation performance, O&M of CIS main infrastructure) efficiently and effectively with \nprovision of necessary equipment, training, and an M&E system to operate it. ALRI central staff \nwill also be trained to operate the M&E system.    \n \n17.  Output 3: Farm management capacity and water use skill improved. This output \nunder the JFPR grant includes (i) demonstration to promote profitable farm management and \nefficient water use, (ii) production of high-quality seeds, and (iii) establishment and possible \nreorganization of WUAs and capacity development of WUAs and beneficiaries. Experienced \n                                                \n17 The same approach is expected from the Afghanistan side under the investment project (Project number 48042-\n001, Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant for Pyanj\u2013Amu Basin Project) currently being prepared by ADB.  \n ", "5 \ninternational  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  recruited  for  required  activities. \nUnder the first component, 300 ha of demonstration plots will promote more profitable farm \nmanagement using improved agronomic techniques (e.g., drill sowing without plowing, zero or \nminimum tillage) conducive for higher productivity and profitability per unit of farmland and more \nefficient water use techniques, and NGOs will disseminate demonstrated activities among CIS \nfarmers by conducting workshops and other efficient methods.   \n \n18.  The second component will (i) supply foundation seed to seed growers and facilitate the \nreproduction of the seeds, and also supply a large number of smaller farmers; (ii) diversify seed \nproduction for vegetable, fruit, and other crops in addition to production of wheat and cotton \nseeds; (iii) develop capacity of the seed growers in seed production; and (iv) reestablish field \nseed laboratories at district offices of the department of agriculture and develop their capacity to \ncertify the seeds. The third component will (i) strengthen WUAs\u2019 institutional, management, and \ntechnical capacities; (ii) support WUAs\u2019 possible reorganization along hydrological boundaries \nfor efficient water management; and (iii) facilitate formation of new WUAs in the remaining \nproject area. At present there are only 20 WUAs covering about 83% of the CIS area, and they \nare not adequately equipped and trained to undertake their tasks efficiently, which has resulted \nin the low collection rate of the irrigation service fee (average 46% in project districts in 2012\u2013\n2014). Activities of NGOs will be coordinated with WUA support unit, whose capacity will be \nstrengthened under output 2. \n \n19.  During project preparation, an M&E system using satellite remote sensing technology \nwas developed and it estimated the water consumption and average water use ratio (i.e., field \napplication efficiency) of CIS farmland at 50%. Output 3 will increase the ratio to 60%. Coupled \nwith monitoring water withdrawal for the CIS, the system could also estimate CIS conveyance \nefficiency (para. 15). The M&E system will be further improved under output 3 and used during \nproject implementation to assess irrigation efficiencies.        \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n20.

To this end, the government will either (i) amend the existing government resolution for setting up \nthe existing PMO, or (ii) issue a new government resolution. In both cases, the resolution shall specify that the \nproject implementation will be enhanced by adding more PMO staff, and staff of three project implementation \noffices. Disbursement of the proceeds of the ADB loan and grant and JFPR grant will be conditional upon the \n \ngovernment\u2019s issuance of the resolution. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  The  capacity  development  JFPR  TA  will  be  provided  to  help  the  MEWR,  the  TA \nexecuting agency, implement output 1. Major TA outputs and activities correspond to the two \nrespective components and activities in each component as provided in para. 14. The financing \nplan, detailed activities, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements are in the attached \nTA.20 The TA is estimated to cost $2.12 million, of which $2.00 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the JFPR and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of office accommodation, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \nConsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The disbursements will be made directly by ADB in \naccordance with its Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). The \nTA will be implemented over a period of five years with estimated commencement in January \n2017 and completion in December 2021. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n24.  The project was designed in the light of sustainable CIS O&M. The sediment-excluding \nbasin will substantially reduce O&M requirements not only at the main, interfarm, and on-farm \ncanals but also at the basin itself by hydraulically flushing around 70% of the sediment that \nenters. The target pump units were selected using carefully developed criteria, which included \nrequired pumping head. The project was found to be at high risk of being impacted by climate \nchange. Climate risk and vulnerability was assessed based on a study undertaken by previous \nADB TA in the PRB (footnote 6). Adaptation measures were incorporated in the project design \nto reduce the risks resulting from increased demand in irrigation water, and sedimentation.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n25.  The project is expected to be economically viable in that the overall calculated economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.3% and the economic net present value of the investment is \nTJS105.7 million at a discount rate of 12%. This strong economic result is due to the substantial \nsize of the economic benefit stream resulting from carefully designed least-cost engineering \n                                                \n20 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \noptions.21 A number of risk variables have been used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Based on \nthe sensitivity analysis, the project viability is observed to be most sensitive to benefits being \ndelayed  by  2  years,  which  causes  the  EIRR  to  fall  to  13.6%\u2014just  marginally  above  the \nbenchmark  of  12.0%\u2014and  the  level  of  decrease  at  which  the  EIRR  would  fall  below  the \nacceptable 12.0% level is only 3 years. Therefore, it is essential that the project be implemented \nas  scheduled  and  technical  and  extension support  be  provided  to  project  beneficiaries  as \nproposed under output 3 in order to ensure project benefits are realized on schedule. It is also \nimportant to stress that system O&M needs to be carried out  appropriately to ensure the \nbenefits can materialize as estimated. 22 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Weaknesses  and  risks  were  identified  in  using  the  country\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement  system  in  internal  control,  procurement management, financial  reporting,  and \nexternal auditing. The existing project management office under ALRI for the ongoing ADB-\nfinanced project has gained enough experience in implementing projects financed by ADB and \nthus will comfortably implement outputs 2 and 3.23 Additional project management office staff \nwill be recruited for the additional workload. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, the MEWR, and ALRI. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  Poverty. The project will address the problems of low agricultural yields, low income, \nand food insecurity in the target areas. Establishing river basin organizations and councils will \nresult  in  improved  WRM.  Modernizing  and  rehabilitating  I&D  systems  will  address  water \nshortages,  while  organizing  demonstration  plots,  producing  high-quality  seeds,  and \nstrengthening WUAs\u2019 capacities will improve water use and farmers\u2019 agricultural skills. This, in \nturn, will lead to increased agricultural yields and improved farmers\u2019 incomes, and address long-\nterm food insecurity. \n \n28.  Social and gender. The project will directly benefit farmers, including women farmers, \nand poor households. Specifically, the project will improve WRM through WUAs and improve \nfarmers\u2019 capacity for water use and their agricultural practices. Categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming, the project will narrow gender gaps in women\u2019s limited representation in WUAs, \nriver basin organizations, and councils. It will ensure that women farmers are not left out in the \ndevelopment  of  demonstration  farms,  production  of  high-quality  seeds,  and  other  training \nprograms aimed at building women\u2019s capacities to take on more active roles in WUAs and \nimprove their farming practices. The project will also ease women\u2019s water-fetching chores as it \nwill install 12 water points for householder use along the main canal and three in each target \ninterfarm canal. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination and environmental \nmanagement  plan  were  prepared  by  ALRI  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n                                                \n21 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Preliminary Asset Management and O&M Plan of CIS (supplementary linked document) was developed. \n23 ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Administration of \nGrant to the Republic of Tajikistan for Building Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin Project. Manila.  \n ", "9 \nStatement (2009). Anticipated major adverse environmental impacts of the project are site \nspecific and are related to clogging of canals and irrigation structures with sediment during \noperation; and physical disturbance, noise, and road safety during transportation of construction \nmaterials for the sediment-excluding basin. Adequate mitigation measures will be incorporated \ninto the project design and will be implemented through the environmental management plan. \nThe initial environmental examination includes provisions for improving the safeguards capacity \nof the project management office. Public consultation (a total of 117 people including WUAs, \nvillage leaders, farmer beneficiaries, local authorities, and ALRI local offices) and information \ndisclosure  was  undertaken  in  March  2015  covering  all  four  districts.  The  draft  initial \nenvironmental examination covering the environmental management plan was disclosed on the \nADB website on 16 February 2016. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not involve or affect any ethnic \nminority or indigenous peoples, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The poverty \nand  social  assessment  study  showed  that  no  ethnic  minority  or  indigenous  peoples  were \npresent in the project area. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require land acquisition. \nThe  sediment-excluding  basin  will  be  constructed  within  the  border  area,  which  is  strictly \ncontrolled. These areas have been fenced since 1994. Since the project is within the existing \nfacilities, the resettlement due diligence report confirmed that no land will be acquired for the \nproject  with  no  past  and  present  claims  on  the  land for  these  existing facilities. The  due \ndiligence report was disclosed on the ADB website in February 2016. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSupreme audit institution  The project will be audited annually by independent private auditors in accordance with \nnot yet established;  the International Standards on Auditing. \nexternal audit not in place  \nDelays in construction  Using advance contracting, the consultant for detailed design, bid preparation, and \nschedule   construction supervision will be fielded from January 2017 to enable the PMO to initiate \nbid process for the major contract in the second quarter of 2017. The bidding document \nwill include performance incentives and penalties to avoid delays in the construction \nschedule. ADB is improving its efficiency in project management and has shortened the \ndisbursement time lag. A time monitoring sheet for each project implementation \nmilestone will be available and updated by the consultant. \nInsufficient available funds  Required O&M will be substantially reduced by constructing the sediment removal \nfor system O&M may  structure and replacing degraded pump and motor units with energy efficient ones in \nthreaten CIS sustainability  target pump stations. The government agreed that CIS asset management and an O&M \n  plan including the increases in the irrigation service fees and budget allocation will be \ndeveloped by ALRI and approved by the government for full cost-recovery in the CIS \nafter completion of modernization and rehabilitation works, but before project \ncompletion.
