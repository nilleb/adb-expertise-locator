INTRODUCTION \n1.  A transport strategy for Mongolia is crucial for optimizing transport\u2019s contribution to \nsustainable and inclusive economic growth in the country. The current strategy was formulated \nin 1999 with World Bank assistance.1 Several developments since then justify the formulation of \na new transport strategy. First, following the approval of the Economic Growth Support and \nPoverty Reduction Strategy by the previous government in 2003, the new Government, which \nwas established in September 2004, remains committed to poverty reduction. A new transport \nstrategy should support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts. Second, the economy has \nshown signs of changes over the past few years. The private sector has replaced government \nas the engine of growth. This requires a new transport strategy that would promote greater \nprivate  sector  involvement  in  transport  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  transport \nservices. Third, Mongolia, together with 26 other Asian countries, signed the Agreement on \nAsian Highway Network Development in April 2004. A new transport strategy should reflect \nMongolia\u2019s commitment to regional transport cooperation and integration. Fourth, rural to urban \nmigration  has  accelerated  since  2000,  caused  in  part  by  consecutive  harsh  winters  and \ndroughts. This has important implications for future transport demand. Fifth, the Government \nhas prepared master plans2 for railways, civil aviation, and Ulaanbaatar urban transport and will \nupdate the road master plan. A new transport strategy would ensure effective integration of \nvarious transport modes and improve competitiveness of the transport system in the country.3 \n \n2.  Consequently, the Government has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for formulating a new transport strategy. The TA4 is included in ADB\u2019s \nCountry Strategy and Program for Mongolia for 2004. A fact-finding mission5 visited Mongolia \nfrom 25\u221229 October 2004 and reached an agreement with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsultants for the TA. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite  recent  increases  in  traffic  volume  and  progress  on  a  number  of  transport \ninfrastructure investment projects, a number of issues relating to the transport sector need to be \naddressed  in  the  new  transport  strategy.  The  major  issues  include  Mongolia\u2019s  landlocked \nlocation, isolated regions within the country, transport and poverty reduction, integration of \nvarious transport modes, transport financing, the need for appropriate transport policies and \nregulations, traffic safety, private sector involvement, and human resource development. \n \n4.  Mongolia  is  landlocked  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  Russian \nFederation and is remote from major developed markets. This results in high transport costs \n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  1999.  Taming  the  Tyrannies  of  Distance  and  Isolation:  A  Transport  Strategy  for  Mongolia. \nWashington, DC. \n2  Mongolian Railways prepared the railway master plan for the period up to 2020. It will soon be submitted to the \nGovernment  for  approval.  The  civil  aviation  master  plan  for  2004\u22122014  prepared  with  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development funding will be re-submitted to the Ministry of Roads, Transport, and Tourism for \napproval  shortly.  The  master  plan  for  Ulaanbaatar  urban  transport  was  prepared  with  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency funding in 1999. The road master plan was developed in 1995 with Asian Development Bank \nassistance and a road transport master plan was prepared in 2004. \n3  The existing master plans for each transport mode will be revised according to the new Transport Strategy \n(2005\u22122015) after the Government approves the strategy. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 October 2004. \n5  Staff of the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency participated in the discussions held during \nthe TA Fact-Finding Mission. ", "2 \nand  requires  appropriate  cross-border  agreements  with  the  two  neighboring  countries. \nMeanwhile, Mongolia can serve as a corridor for transit traffic between the two countries, \nreducing their transport costs and providing a sustainable source of foreign exchange earnings \nfor Mongolia. The transport strategy should take into account the implications of Mongolia\u2019s \nunique location and provide guidance to help overcome its adverse impact on development. \n \n5.  Because of the large territory, sparse population,6 and inadequate transport networks, \nvarious regions within Mongolia suffer from isolation from the country\u2019s political and economic \ncenters. Roads to remote areas, particularly in western Mongolia, are deteriorating and many \nare impassable during the rainy or winter seasons. Airlines have reduced domestic flights \nsignificantly with only four aircrafts currently in operation due to continued financial losses. As a \nresult, residents in remote rural areas lack reasonable access to markets and social services. \nThe transport strategy should identify the best ways to help reduce the isolation of remote \nregions and increase the internal integration of the country. \n \n6.  Poverty remains a major concern in Mongolia, as about 36% of the population is living \nbelow the poverty line. Lack of basic transport infrastructure and services is a dominant problem \nfor  many  of  the  poor  in  rural  areas  and  for  rapidly  growing  numbers  in  cities.  Transport \ndevelopment can facilitate poverty reduction by increasing the accessibility of the poor to social \nservices, markets, and business; and creating job and income opportunities. Thus, targeted \ntransport investments to the poor or poor regions must be an integral element of the transport \nstrategy to ensure that the poor benefit the most from improved transport performance. \n \n7.  Mongolia\u2019s  transport  sector  comprises  railways,  roads,  civil  aviation,  and  inland \nwaterways. Railways are the dominant mode of transport, accounting for more than 90% of \nfreight traffic and about 55% of passenger traffic. Roads carry most of the remaining traffic.  \nCivil  aviation  plays  a  key  role  in  providing  international  access  and  linking  remote  aimag \ncenters. The role of inland waterways is limited to a few lakes located in northern Mongolia. \nGiven the country\u2019s large territory and the limitation of the existing network for each transport \nmode, the adoption of an integrated multimodal transport approach is most cost-effective to \nimprove  transport  system  performance.  Such  an  approach  requires  developing  well-linked \nmodal  infrastructure,  harmonizing  regulations  and  procedures  set  by  modal  agencies,  and \nsolving multimodal logistical obstacles. \n \n8.  Inadequate  financing  is  a  principal  constraint  to  transport  sector  development.  \nThe Transport Strategy formulated in 1999 requires annual funding equivalent to 3.5% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) for the transport sector during 1999\u22122014. However, the actual funding \nduring  1999\u22122003  accounted  for  no  more  than  1.5%  of  GDP  per  annum.  Funding  for \nmaintenance, particularly road maintenance, has been limited. Funding for road maintenance \naccounted for less than 0.2% of GDP, which is lower than in many other Asian countries. As a \nresult, while transport infrastructure is expanding, the existing infrastructure is deteriorating \nrapidly.  The  transport  strategy  should  identify  sector  priorities,  selection  criteria  for  public \ninvestment projects in the sector, and the financial resources required for their implementation. \nThis would ensure that limited financial resources are allocated to priority areas and projects. \n \n9.  Policies and regulations in the transport sector need to be improved. Regulations on \nroad transport operations nationwide need to be established and those for urban areas to be \nrevised  to  create  an  environment  for  fair  competition  among  transport  operators.  Road \n                                                 \n6  Mongolia has a total land area of 1.6 million square kilometers (about 4 times larger than that of Japan) and a \npopulation of 2.5 million, with a low population density of 1.6 persons per square kilometer. ", "    3 \nmaintenance should be funded primarily from road user charges. In the railway subsector, \nconsideration  should  be  given  to  private  sector  participation  in  passenger  operations  and \nenclave  arrangements  for  dedicated  mineral  operations  to  enhance  reliance  on  market \nprinciples. The tariff policies that result in subsidizing railway passengers from freight revenues, \ndomestic flight passengers from international flights, and urban passenger transport need to be \nrevisited.  Appropriate  policies  should  be  developed  to  address  road  safety  and  vehicle \nemissions \u2212 one of the primary causes of deteriorating air quality in Ulaanbaatar. \n \n10.  Traffic safety is an emerging issue. Since the mid-1990s road traffic accidents have \nincreased significantly, with the total rising from 1,753 in 1994 to 5,278 in 2003. The fatality rate \nfor 2003 was 28 persons per 10,000 vehicles, which was higher than in many other Asian \ncountries.7 Traffic accidents are particularly acute in Ulaanbaatar. The main reasons include \npoor driving skills, intoxicated driving, and high vehicle speeds. Government funding for traffic \nsafety awareness and training programs is inadequate. With the present rapid rate of growth in \nvehicle ownership, road accidents could increase, unless action is taken to address them. \n \n11.  The involvement of the private sector in the transport sector is mainly in road transport \nservices and, to a much less extent, in civil aviation. The proposal to privatize Mongolian \nAirlines has yet to be implemented, although a foreign firm8 has been contracted to manage its \noperations. The private sector remains absent in railways, which is monopolized by Mongolian \nRailways.9 Interest of private financing in transport infrastructure investments is limited. Strong \nefforts are needed to promote greater private sector involvement in the sector by improving \nsector policies and regulations. \n \n12.  Despite some improvements, human resource capacity in the transport sector remains \nweak.  Government  officials,  transport  infrastructure  construction  companies,  transport \noperators, and consumers have limited knowledge of transport policies and regulations needed \nfor  a  market  economy,  management  of  commercially  based  transport  operations,  new \ntechnologies  in  construction  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure,  and  appropriate \nmethodology for evaluating transport investment projects. Further measures are needed to \nstrengthen human resource capacity in the sector. \n \n13.  Since 1991 Mongolia has received external assistance to address these transport sector \nissues. In addition to World Bank assistance for formulating the Transport Strategy in 1999, \nADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  helped  prepare  master  plans  for  roads,  civil  aviation,  and \nUlaanbaatar urban transport, respectively (footnote 2). ADB and other external aid sources10 \nhelped develop road networks. ADB and EBRD helped improve air transport infrastructure and \noperations. The World Bank assisted Mongolian Railways in improving the financial accounting \nsystem. JICA provided support for improving urban transport infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  Mongolia  (2005\u22122006)  identifies \ntransport as a strategically important sector for ADB assistance. As of 31 October 2004, ADB \nhad extended five loans totaling $147.1 million and nine TA grants totaling about $5.6 million for \nthe  sector.  ADB  assistance  helps  develop  the  north-south  road  corridor  and  air  transport \n                                                 \n7  For example, the road accident fatality rate in the PRC for 2001 was 17 persons per 10,000 vehicles. \n8  An Irish company is currently contracted to manage operations of Mongolian Airlines with grant financing from the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \n9  Mongolian Railways is owned equally by the Government of Mongolia and Russian Railways. \n10 Including the PRC, European Union, Germany, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Republic of Korea, \nKuwait Fund, and the World Bank.  ", "4 \ninfrastructure, facilitate sector reform, strengthen institutional capacity, and prepare the road \nmaster plan. ADB\u2019s portfolio performance in the sector is generally satisfactory. Evaluation of \nthe country assistance program conducted in 200211 concluded that ADB\u2019s transport projects \nhelped increase traffic counts, improve transport safety, advance sector reform, and expand \neconomic activities in the project-influenced areas. \n \n15.  ADB  has  collaborated with  other external  aid  agencies  in  support  for  the  transport \nsector.  A  working  group  on  infrastructure,  co-chaired  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  was \nestablished in April 2004 to coordinate external assistance activities in the sector. The working \ngroup held policy dialogue with the Government on transport strategy and financing issues and \ncoordinated with the Government on preparing terms of reference for consultants for the TA. \n \n16.  Three lessons learned were applied when formulating the TA. First, country ownership \nand public consultations are key to TA relevance and effectiveness. The Government took the \nlead  in  preparing  the  terms  of  reference  for  TA  consultants.  The  Mission  held  extensive \nconsultations with the Government, civil society, transport operators, private sector, and other \nexternal aid agencies on TA design. The TA thus reflects a high degree of country ownership \nand  consensus  among  stakeholders.  Second,  the  new  transport  strategy  will  adopt  an \nintegrated multimodal transport approach and provide directions for future activities from the \nperspective of the transport sector, rather than from each transport mode. Third, linking a \nstrategy to resources is fundamental to success. The new transport strategy will identify future \nsector priorities and funding requirements for implementing them. Such funding requirements \nmust be reflected in the Government's medium-term fiscal framework. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n17.  The goal of the TA is to improve transport performance to facilitate sustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction in Mongolia. The purpose is to help the Government formulate a \ntransport  strategy  for  2005\u22122015.  Taking  into  account  Mongolia\u2019s  long-term  development \nobjectives, the transport strategy will identify the best ways to respond to the sector challenges \nand set strategic priorities and resources for transport development in the next 10 years. As the \nexpected output of the TA, the transport strategy will serve as the Government\u2019s key document \nguiding the policies and public investments in the transport sector for 2005\u22122015. The outline of \nthe transport strategy is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  International consultants with support from domestic consultants will be engaged to help \nthe Government prepare the transport strategy. With assistance from the major external aid \nagencies, the Government prepared the terms of reference for TA consultants. The TA will \ninvolve  analytical  and  innovative  research,  fieldwork,  and  public  consultations  with  the \nGovernment, civil society, private sector, local communities, and external aid agencies. \n \n19.  The key activities of the TA include (i) undertaking an analytical review of the current \nstatus of the transport sector and preparing a transport sector update; (ii) reviewing the existing \nmaster plans for civil aviation, railways, roads, and Ulaanbaatar urban transport; (iii) identifying \nthe long-term sector challenges and assessing the Government\u2019s response to the challenges; \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002.

Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $353,000 equivalent, comprising $226,000 in \nforeign exchange and $127,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $300,000 to cover \nthe entire foreign exchange cost and $74,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining  local  currency  costs  in  kind  by  providing  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and \nadministrative support. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The Ministry of Roads, Transport, and Tourism (MORTT) will be the Executing Agency. \nA steering committee12 will be set up to guide TA implementation. It will be chaired at least by \nthe Director General of the Transport Policy and Coordination Department of MORTT and \ncomprise representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of \nAgriculture, Civil Aviation Authority, Railway Authority, Traffic Police Department, Ulaanbaatar \nMunicipal Government, and major external aid agencies involved in the transport sector. The \nTransport  Policy  and  Coordination  Department  will  coordinate  TA  activities,  supervise  the \nconsultant\u2019s work, and monitor TA performance. The Department will appoint a TA coordinator, \nwho will provide liaison between the consultants, MORTT, and other government agencies.  \n \n22.  The  TA  will  provide  a  total  of  29.5  person-months  of  consulting  services  (9.5 \ninternational and 20 domestic) through a consulting firm. The consultants should have expertise \nin transport strategy, planning, economics, financial management, and engineering. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be recruited \naccording to the quality- and cost-based selection method of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants.  Given  the  analytical  nature  of  the  TA  and  the  required  innovative  approach, \nsimplified technical proposals will be used to select the consultants. Procurement of equipment, \nsupplies,  and  materials  by  consultants  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The equipment will be turned over to MORTT after TA completion. The TA is \nexpected to be implemented during January\u2212August 2005. The final draft transport strategy will \nbe disseminated to the public upon TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Formulating a Transport Strategy (2005\u22122015), and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n12 Since the objectives and composition of the steering committee are similar to those of the working group on \ninfrastructure established earlier for aid coordination, the steering committee will be complementary to the work of \nthe working group.
