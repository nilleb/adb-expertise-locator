INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) highlights regional integration as \none  of  the  three  complementary  strategic  agenda,  along  with  inclusive  growth  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth.1 Under the regional integration agenda, ADB is mainly \nundertaking four roles: (i) increasing financial resources for regional cooperation and integration \n(RCI) projects, (ii) expanding the dissemination of RCI-related knowledge products, (iii) building \nthe institutional capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) to manage RCI, and (iv) \nworking as a catalyst and coordinator for closer cooperation among regional member countries. \nFollowing the launch of Strategy 2020 in 2008, and supported by the adoption of the RCI \nStrategy in 2006, RCI has become fully integrated as a strategic and operational pillar in most \ncountry  partnership  strategies. 2  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  continues  to \nunderscore the RCI agenda, with support for RCI accounting for 22% of overall volume of ADB \noperations during 2013\u20132015.3 ADB is working to meet the target of at least 30% by 2020. \n \n2.  The Regional Cooperation and Integration Division (ERCI) plays an important role in \nsupporting ADB\u2019s mandate to promote RCI through its (i) knowledge products and services such \nas the Asian Economic Integration Report (AEIR), (ii) support for regional and global policy \nforums, and (iii) generation and maintenance of RCI-related data and research in support of \nADB\u2019s RCI operations. Building on the success of previous technical assistance (TA) projects \nsupporting  the  Asia  Regional Integration  Center (ARIC),4 the TA  will  extend  ERCI\u2019s major \nresearch and knowledge work with a heightened focus on the following areas: (i) strengthening \nthe quality and impact of the AEIR, (ii) enhancing ADB\u2019s profile as a knowledge leader and DMC \npartner on RCI through effective support for ADB participation in regional and global policy \nforums, and (iii) improving the quality of the RCI database and policy analysis. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The region faces growing challenges amid sluggish global economic recovery and a \nslowdown  in  regional  economic  growth,  which  could  undermine  the  sustained  growth \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  The ARIC is a one-stop and web-based portal containing knowledge and information such as (i) RCI-related \ninitiatives, studies, news, opinions, and editorials; (ii) a macroeconomic and financial indicators database; (iii) an \nintegration indicator database on finance, trade, labor mobility, and foreign direct investment (FDI); (iv) a free trade \nagreement (FTA) database and tool kit; and (v) an early warning system database. It was established in 2006 by \nADB through its Office of Regional Economic Integration (currently known as ERCI) to (i) provide access to timely \nand relevant knowledge and information on RCI, (ii) assist regional economic monitoring and policy dialogue, and \n(iii) support research on RCI. Previous TA projects that supported the creation and maintenance of the ARIC and \nits precursor, the Asia Recovery Information Center, include the following: ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for the \nEstablishment of the Asia Recovery Information Center. Manila (TA 5848-REG); ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance \nfor the Asia Recovery Information Center, Phase II.

A  fast-changing  global  and  regional  economic  environment  and \nassociated  challenges  underscore  the  importance  of  closer  economic  cooperation  and \nintegration for the region\u2019s sustained and stable growth. \n \n4.  Regional integration helps (i) unlock growth potential for Asia and the Pacific by (a) \ncreating common regional markets through reducing barriers to trade, finance, and investment \nflows, and (b) enhancing cross-border connectivity; (ii) mobilize regional savings for regional \ninvestments; and (iii) reduce macroeconomic and financial vulnerability to shocks. Meanwhile, \nregional cooperation helps fend off potential risks of financial instability and forge effective policy \nresponses to contain spillover risks. This is especially important since the need to manage the \nrisks from increased interdependencies and spillovers from negative shocks originating both \ninside and outside the region is becoming increasingly crucial. \n \n5.  RCI is gaining some traction in Asia and the Pacific. For instance, intraregional trade \nshare remains stable at around 55% since 2002. From 2010 to 2014, the region\u2019s outward \nforeign direct investments (FDIs) increased by 45.3% to $512 billion, and intraregional FDI is \nestimated at $255 billion in 2014, accounting for 52.6% of total inflows.7 On portfolio capital \nflows, intraregional outward portfolio shares\u2014for both equity and debt\u2014increased from 18.7% \nin 2013 to 19.5% in 2014 even though the region was and remains more integrated with global \nmarkets than with regional markets. Free trade agreements (FTAs) continue to proliferate: \ncumulatively, 151 FTAs had been concluded by 2015, up from 45 in 2000.8 In addition, dynamic \ndevelopments in the RCI policy arena are taking place\u2014including the signing of the Trans-\nPacific Partnership among 12 members in February 2016,9 and progress in negotiations of the \nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership10\u2014that will significantly change the economic \nand policy environment for trade and investments among economies in the region. The region\u2019s \nproduction network has also strengthened and become increasingly interwoven with the global \nproduction network over the past decades.  A deepening global value chain has significant \nimplications on the changing trade and investment pattern, which requires appropriate policy \nresponses. It can widen the wedge between statutory tariffs and actual tariff costs, for example. \n \n6.  All  these  developments  call  for  deeper  analysis  on  how  regional  integration  is \nprogressing through trade and investments, financial interconnectedness, and movement of \npeople, and how regional cooperation can help in promoting inclusive and sustainable growth, \n                                                \n6  In this paper, \"region\" refers to the Asia and Pacific region.

The  fast-changing  economic  environment  and  emerging  challenges  require  policy \nmakers in the region to stay vigilant in monitoring developments in regional economic issues \nand forging appropriate policy responses nationally as well as regionally. Various regional and \nglobal forums, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN+3,11 Asia\u2013Europe Meeting, and East Asia Summit, all aim to \ndiscuss policy measures to respond to and address growing challenges, and maximize mutual \nbenefits through concerted actions and cooperation among regional economies. In tandem with \nthis, ADB\u2019s knowledge support role for these regional policy forums through relevant research \nand analytical work is becoming increasingly important. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced awareness of RCI and how to leverage it for inclusive and \nsustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific. The outcome will be  the creation of new  RCI \nknowledge, policy options, and strategic suggestions to address pressing regional economic \nand  development  issues,  which  will  be  shared  in  various  regional  forums  and  with  key \nstakeholders. The outcome will be measured through the number of high-quality, high-impact \nknowledge products and events on major RCI issues, reflected in the number of media citations \nand interviews, use of ARIC data and information in management speeches, and utilization of \ndata and information by internal and external clients from the ARIC website. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The outputs will include (i) key RCI publications and knowledge products, such as the \nAEIR and biannual confidential notes (reports on economic prospects and policy issues) for \nASEAN+3; and (ii) timely generation of accurate RCI indicators and database, which will provide \neffective research and data support for ADB management\u2019s participation in regional and global \npolicy forums, and an information service for external clients, both in the policy arena and \nacademia. \n \n10.  These outputs will be delivered through the following key activities: \n(i)  Generation of key regional cooperation and integration publications and \nknowledge products. In addition to providing updates on RCI progress in the areas of \ntrade and investments, financial integration, movement of people, and trade policy, the \nAEIR will feature high-quality thematic chapters on recent and/or impending challenges \nand  issues  (e.g.,  FDI,  macroeconomic  and  financial  vulnerabilities  and \ninterconnectedness, global and regional value chains, and people mobility). In support of \nthe ASEAN+3 meetings, reports on regional economic outlook and risks, as well as RCI \nprogress  on  trade  and  financial  integration,  will  also  be  prepared  in  time  for  the \nsemiannual ASEAN+3 finance and central bank deputies\u2019 meetings. The TA will also \nstrengthen support for ADB\u2019s RCI operations through knowledge generation on RCI-\nrelated  issues,  such  as  regional  trade  and  investment,  financial  cooperation  and \nintegration, regional connectivity, and regional public goods. Stronger coordination with \nADB\u2019s operations departments will be pursued in terms of selection of research topics \n                                                \n11 ASEAN members plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n ", " 4 \nand  use  of  appropriate  methodologies  for  better  relevance  of  knowledge  work  to \noperational needs. Research focus will be guided by the RCI strategy, with priority given \nto topics that are highlighted during regional and global policy forums, and to emerging \nissues where research could contribute to fruitful discussions among policy makers, with \ndue consideration of regional knowledge solutions covered in ADB\u2019s regional knowledge \nplans. Given the scale and increasing frequency of climate-related and other natural \nhazards, and the serious damage they cause, studies on regional public goods will be \nexplored  in  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s  operations  departments  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Climate  Change  Department.  The  TA\u2019s  operational  support  also \nincludes  conducting  the  annual  survey  of trade finance  in  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department. \n \n(ii)  Maintenance of regional cooperation and integration databases. The TA will \ncontinue to provide a timely and accurate macroeconomic and financial database, a \nregional integration indicators database (i.e., finance, trade, labor mobility, and FDI); an \nFTA database and tool kit; and an early warning system database, which can be used by \nstakeholders inside and outside ADB, practitioners, and academia to help their policy- \nand research-related work. Enhancements will be made to make these databases user-\nfriendly and easy to access. \n \n(iii)  Dissemination of key regional cooperation and integration information and \nknowledge products. To present the key findings of the AEIR, the TA will organize and \nconduct both internal and external AEIR launches and seminars in collaboration with \nADB\u2019s regional departments and Department of External Relations. Outreach programs \nwill target DMC officials, global and regional think tanks and opinion leaders, and other \nstakeholders. AEIR copies will be made available both in print and online formats. \nEffective  dissemination  of  RCI  knowledge  products  will  also  be  pursued  through \ninternational conferences and seminars in collaboration with research institutions. The \nTA will use social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, to disseminate the \nTA\u2019s outputs. Blog entries will be posted on the ARIC website to feature RCI issues and \ntopics and raise awareness on emerging challenges and priorities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 26 months from June 2016 to July 2018. ADB will be \nthe executing agency. The TA will be implemented by ERCI with support from other divisions of \nADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department and other ADB departments, \noffices,  and  thematic  groups,  particularly  the  RCI  thematic  group.  For  possible  research \ncollaboration  and  joint  conferences  and  dissemination  activities  based  on  their  areas  of \nexpertise and research interests, the TA will also identify and partner with suitable centers of \nexcellence12 in the region or globally. \n                                                \n12 Centers of excellence are \u201crenowned knowledge providers outside and within Asia and the Pacific (including in \nDMCs) with whom ADB could partner for knowledge solutions.\u201d Source: ADB. 2013.

The TA will require approximately 5 person-months of international consulting services, \n268 person-months of national consulting services, and 5 person-months of resource persons. \nAll consultants will be selected and engaged individually by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For this TA, hiring \na  team  of  individual  consultants  will  provide  more  benefits for  ADB than  engaging  a firm \nbecause of the following reasons: (i) faster mobilization of consultants, (ii) greater control by \nADB  staff  in  selecting  and  managing  individual  consultants,  and  (iii)  greater  flexibility  in \nengaging experts specializing in a broad spectrum of RCI-related topics that need to quickly \nadjust to evolving needs of stakeholders. \n \n14.  A team of ERCI staff comprising at least three international staff members (one of them \nacting as the project leader as well as the leader of the team of consultants, one national officer, \nand one operations assistant) will oversee and lead the implementation of the TA. For the \nproduction of research outcomes, including the AEIR, the team will organize internal seminars \nand workshops, which will include operations department experts as resource persons, as \nappropriate, to gather feedback and inputs. An international consultant will be hired to edit ERCI \npublications and speeches as well as ARIC website content. National consultants will include a \nprincipal economic analyst, who will provide coordination support to ARIC\u2019s operations; four \nsenior economic analysts, who will lead the delivery of ARIC\u2019s core outputs, including the AEIR; \nand three economic analysts and a statistician, who will maintain and update the contents of the \nARIC website and database, and assist in the preparation of ARIC publications and seminars. \nOther national consultants include one full-time system and database developer. One website \ndeveloper and one multimedia designer and developer will also be engaged on an intermittent \nbasis. About 18 resource persons who are internationally distinguished experts will be engaged \nfor  5  person-months  to  present  or  facilitate  discussions  at  seminars  and  other  events.  A \ntypesetter, who will be sourced from the Department of External Relations list of accredited \nservice providers, will be responsible for the typesetting and page layout of the AEIR. Appendix \n3 provides the outline terms of reference for consultants. \n \n15.  Purchases of equipment (computer hardware and software) and statistical databases will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and \nOffice of Administrative Services, where applicable. After the TA is completed, any procured \nequipment  will  be  disposed  of  in  compliance  with  Administering  Grant-Financed  Technical \nAssistance Projects in the Project Administration Instructions.13 Disbursements under this TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Asian Economic Integration: Building Knowledge for Policy Dialogue project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2013.
