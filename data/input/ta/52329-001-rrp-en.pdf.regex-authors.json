I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed Pacific \nRenewable Energy Program (Program) of up to $100,000,000 for the issue of guarantees and the \nprovision of loans benefiting renewable power projects in Pacific island countries. \n \n2.  The Program will provide a financing structure to support the power payment obligations \nof power utilities where governments are unable to guarantee a utility\u2019s offtake obligations under \npower purchase agreements (PPAs) due to fiscal constraints.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Program Description \n \n3.  Rationale.  ADB\u2019s  14  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  share  similar \ndevelopment challenges,  including  small  populations,  limited  resources,  remoteness, \nsusceptibility  to natural  disasters,  and  vulnerability  to  external  shocks.  They  are  currently \nembarking on a structural transition from power generation based on fossil fuels to generation \nfrom renewable energy sources, so as to lower power generation costs, reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and improve energy security. However, given the small size of their economies and \npower utilities, the PDMCs face unique capacity constraints. The lack of technical capacity of the \npower utilities in the renewable energy segment limits the internal skills available to manage grids \nthat are moving rapidly from relatively simple single-source generation systems (diesel) to grids \nwith multiple intermittent renewable energy sources (wind, solar, and hydropower). This requires \nmore sophisticated integration systems and stronger technical expertise. Moreover, the structural \nshift entails significant investment. Commercial and public sector funding for power utilities is \ninadequate. Private sector investment in owning and operating intermittent renewable energy \ngeneration facilities is crucial to supplementing local capacity and filling the investment gap in the \nsector. Most PMDCs are now actively seeking investments from independent power producers \n(IPPs).1  \n \n4.  Barriers. Private sector investment in renewable energy in the Pacific region is currently \nrestricted by  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] (ii) lack of bankability of PPAs, (iii) \nuncertainties over foreign currency availability and convertibility, (iii) political risks, and (iv) low \ncapacity of governments and utilities for engaging the market and preparing bankable PPAs. The \nprivate sector relies on sovereign guarantees to backstop the offtake obligations of power utilities. \nHowever, many PDMCs are unable to provide guarantees for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  Governments are reluctant to provide guarantees because the obligation will be \ncounted as a contingent liability and will contribute to national debt. \n(ii)  Often, PDMCs do not have any headroom within their mandated debt ceilings or \nwould prefer to utilize available headroom for direct borrowing. \n(iii)  The  small  scale  of  many  transactions  means  that  the  transaction  costs  for \nestablishing a guarantee product is prohibitive.  \n \n5.  Design. The Program is designed to work within these constraints and encourage private \nsector investment by using donor funds to backstop the power payment obligations of power \nutilities. The design for each project under the Program includes one or more of the following \nforms of financing support:  \n                                                \n1  A sector overview in presented in Linked Document 1. \n ", "2   \n \n(i)  A partial risk guarantee (PRG) covering standard political risks and breaches of \ncontract under the PPA, which includes coverage of failure by the utility to make a \ntermination payment in the event of full default by the power utility, as set out in \nthe PPA.2 Payment for breach of contract is made under the PRG upon arbitral \naward.3  \n(ii)  A direct loan provided to support a private sector IPP borrower; or, where ADB \ncannot  fund  a  loan  in  local  currency,  then  an  ADB  partial  credit  guarantee \nbenefiting one or more local lenders to the project may be made available to the \nIPP instead of a direct loan. \n(iii)  A Letter of Credit (LC) facility to cover short-term liquidity risk, to be drawable by \nthe IPP in an amount covering payments due under the PPA for a specific period. \nADB may arrange for a maximum period of 24 months of PPA payments per project. \nThe LC will cover the risk that a power utility as an offtaker fails to make payments \nto the project in accordance with the terms of the PPA, and the LC will be reinstated \nonce the utility has restored the outstanding payments. The LC, if provided, will be \nfully funded by development partner funds. The LC will cover the risk that a power \nutility as offtaker fails to make payments to the project in accordance with the terms \nof PPA.  \n(iv)  Technical  assistance  (TA)  for  transaction  advisory  support  and  streamlined \nprocesses  to  reduce  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  relatively  small \ntransaction  sizes  in  the  Pacific,  and  to  assist  with  capacity  building  in \nenvironmental and social safeguards.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n6.  The above arrangements will benefit projects within the Program by enhancing the \ncreditworthiness of the power utilities in meeting power payment obligations under the PPA and \nmitigating political risk for lenders. To the extent that concessional financing sources make funds \navailable to the Program, the Program also has the potential to (i) reduce the cost of financing \nthrough lenders by providing longer tenors or lower margins, which in turn is expected to feed \nthrough to a lower power tariff for consumers; and (ii) attract additional investors and lenders that \nhave traditionally found it difficult to accept power utility offtake risk in the Pacific.  \n \n7.  Combined ADB Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) financing (i.e., the combination of both \nloans and guarantees) for each project under the Program will not exceed $10 million. The PRG \nand/or loan for each project will be processed and approved under following ADB\u2019s standard \nnonsovereign processes.4  \n \n8.  Program development. The Program has been developed by PSOD and PARD under a \n\u201cOne ADB\u201d approach. This approach leverages PARD\u2019s close relationship with the Pacific power \nutilities. The Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility (PREIF) was approved in May 2017 \nto support ADB investment in sovereign renewable energy projects in the smallest 11 Pacific \nIsland  member  countries  and  to  assist  in  sector  reform.  PREIF  identified  a  donor-backed \nguarantee program as a key activity to promote private investment in the Pacific energy sector, \nas part of the sector reform agenda. Development of a regional guarantee program is an output \n                                                \n2  Expropriation, inconvertibility/nontransferability, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.  \n3  The PRG will not cover PSOD lending. \n4  It is anticipated that ADB will provide both guarantees and financing for most projects, however some projects may \nonly utilize one product or the other. \n ", "3 \n \nindicator of PREIF. PREIF funded design work for the Program and is envisaged to provide \ntechnical assistance during implementation. PSOD and PARD will work together to implement the \nProgram and identify pipeline transactions. PSOD will be responsible for processing guarantees \nand project financing for individual private sector projects. Debt financing terms and conditions to \nsponsors will be determined on a project by project basis. PARD, PSOD, and ADB\u2019s Office of \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) will manage TAs to develop upstream capacity and provide \ntransaction advisory services where practical.5  \n \n9.  Moral hazard. There is potential moral hazard in providing the Program to power utilities \nthat are unable to access a government guarantee to backstop their offtake obligations because \na power utility may choose to default on its obligations and rely on the backstop support provided \nby the Program. The risk will be mitigated through structures that will differ from project to project \nbut may include (i) cash security from the power utility to cover three months LC on a first-loss \nbasis,6 (ii) the potential for minority equity ownership by the power utility, and (iii) the potential for \nequity investment by national superannuation funds.7  \n \nB.  Program Pipeline  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10.  Project origination. ADB is currently financing, or has a pipeline to finance, energy sector \nprojects (mainly renewable energy) in all the PDMCs. ADB is the largest investor in the Pacific \nenergy sector at present. The Program will leverage this extensive network with Pacific power \nutilities to identify planned transactions in the early stages under the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach and \nwill build capacity for energy sector expansion and private sector interest in the region. TA funds \nwill be used to originate transactions with power utilities and to help Pacific power utilities and \ngovernments to improve the quality of doing business with the private sector. The Program will \nbe made available to all bidders; however, it will include eligibility criteria and is subject to due \ndiligence satisfactory to ADB, internal credit approvals, and final documentation covering each \nIPP and its sponsors. \n \nC.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  Impact and outcome. The impact will be increased generation of renewable energy in \nthe Pacific, as stated under the Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific 2010\u2013\n2020.8 The outcome will be increased private sector investment in renewable energy in the \nPacific.9 \n \n12.  Outputs. The Program output is successful establishment of the Pacific Renewable \nEnergy Program. The output will support an estimated 5 separate renewable energy projects in \nPDMCs over a 5-year period. \n                                                \n5  Technical assistance may be provided through (i) Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility (AP3F), and (ii) through \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. \n6  Any call under the LC will be first served by the power utility cash balance prior to being served pro-rata by the \ndevelopment partners backstopping the letter of credit. \n7  The design for addressing moral hazard will be considered on a country by country basis and is discussed further in \nLinked Document 2. \n8  Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 2011. Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific, 2010\u20132020. \nSuva. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community is currently completing a review of the Framework for Action on \nEnergy Security in the Pacific 2010-2020 and commencing preparation of the next 10-year framework. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4   \n \nD.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n13.  The development objective is to provide credit enhancement mechanisms to hedge \nagainst the key risks inherent in power projects in the PDMCs, which will increase private \ninvestment in the energy sector. The Program will (i) lower the cost of financing and encourage \nfinancing with longer tenors, which will feed through to lower power tariffs; (ii) attract new investors \nand lenders to the PDMCs, where they might not otherwise invest; (iii) generate financing \nopportunities for PSOD; and (iv) increase PSOD\u2019s focus on frontier markets in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.10 The Program is aligned with the operational priorities of Strategy 2030 in \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability.   \n \n14.  The additionality provided by ADB is in sourcing and using available grant funds for the \nPDMCs from ADB\u2019s development partners as a credit enhancement tool that will mobilize private \nfinancing. This will spur self-sustaining private sector development, reduce continued reliance of \npower utilities on grants and subsidies, and increase energy supply. Technical assistance under \nthe Program will assist in strengthening governance and institutional capacity through building \nskills in financial sustainability, service delivery, capacity and standards. \n \nE.  Lessons Learned \n \n15.  Studies by the Independent Evaluation Department highlight the following lessons, which \nwere incorporated into the Program design.11  \n \n(i)  Marketing and origination of potential guarantees to commercial banks is made \ndifficult because ADB\u2019s client is the borrower and not the beneficiary of the \nguarantee. The Program counters this problem through upstream engagement \nwith the power utilities to identify a pipeline.  \n(ii)  Knowledge of the guarantee business is partially lacking within ADB. The Program \novercomes this through a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, whereby PSOD and PARD work \ncollaboratively to identify and implement projects under the Program.  \n(iii)  Without forward project identification, programs are often unutilized. This is being \navoided by significant work in upstream project identification and market sounding.  \n \n16.  The following lessons learnt from development of solar power projects in the Pacific by \nPARD have also been incorporated into its Program design.  \n \n(i)  Land acquisition. Land acquisition is a major risk for development of energy \nprojects in the Pacific. Projects should secure land tenure early in the project cycle \nto avoid subsequent delays.  \n(ii)  Power grid strengthening. Some Pacific grids require upgrading of transmission \nand distribution systems prior to development of renewable energy generation. \nRenewable energy feasibility studies must assess grid strength to avoid dispatch \nissues during operation.  \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2018.

Many Pacific power grids require installation of battery storage for \nadditional intermittent renewable energy (solar or wind) integration. Feasibility \nstudies should ensure that battery storage is incorporated into project design. \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n \n17.  The Program will consist of the following instruments: \n \n(i)  Partial  Risk  Guarantee.  The  PRG  will  support  commercial  loans  with  an \naggregate principal amount of up to $50 million plus interest and PRG fees thereon \nunder the Program. PRG coverage will wherever possible and appropriate be risk-\nparticipated by concessional financing sources to reduce cost, and increase the \ndiversity of PRG cover, to IPPs undertaking projects under the Program.  \n(ii)  Nonsovereign operations ordinary capital resources loans. ADB will lend up \nto  $50  million  from  its  OCR  to  IPPs  under  the  Program.  As  with  the  PRG \narrangements, in addition to its OCR financing, ADB will seek to draw into each \nproject both parallel cofinancing and, where available and appropriate, third-party \nconcessional financing with ADB as lender-of-record. Where a direct ADB OCR \nloan is not suitable for an IPP because of a currency mismatch, an ADB partial \ncredit guarantee benefiting a local lender to the project may be made available. \n \n18.  Additional support may be made available to the Program, including the following:  \n \n(a)  Letter of Credit. The LC for projects will be funded from a $3 million grant provided \nby the Government of New Zealand, which has been approved. Further grant funds \nfrom development partners may be made available to fund LCs in accordance with \ntheir respective trust agreements as the Program matures. Funds from the Asian \nDevelopment Fund may also be considered. The LC for each project will be in an \namount covering up to twenty-four months of power payments from the utility. \nWhere practical, the first three months of power payments in cash collateral for the \nLC will be obtained from the utility to take the first loss on the LC if it is called.  \n(b)  Technical Assistance. TA will be provided on a case-by-case basis for project \norigination  and  transaction  advisory  support  through  the  Asia  Pacific Project \nPreparation Facility (AP3F) and PREIF.12  \n \n19.  The tenor of each PRG will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with \nprospective lenders. Under current market conditions, it is estimated that the tenor will be up to \n15 years. An annual guarantee fee and commitment fee will be charged to the lender, to be \ndetermined project by project. The guaranteed percentage would be up to 99% of principal, \ninterest, and guarantee fees. The claims processed under the PRG will follow standard ADB \nprocedures. Loan approval will be processed in accordance with NSO lending guidelines under \nADB\u2019s standard nonsovereign processes. Details of the guarantee structure are presented in LD2 \nGuarantee and Debt Structure and will be approved by Management. The Program financing plan \nis presented in Table 2 below.  \n \n                                                \n12 To be assessed on a case by case basis.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The implementation period for the Program will take place over 20 years from April 2019 \nto April 2039. Loans and guarantees under the Program may be prepared for approval under \nADB\u2019s nonsovereign business processes for a 5-year period between April 2019 and April 2024. \nThe deadline for the final approval under the Program will be 30 April 2024. Individual loans and \nguarantees will have a maximum tenor of 15 years. Multiple projects in a single country deploying \nguarantees or loans under the Program may be approved. No financing cap applies to an \nindividual country other than the established country exposure limits. Regional projects may also \nbe considered across multiple PDMCs.  \n \n21.  The proposed guarantees and loans to the projects to be provided under NSO will all be \nsmall-volume transactions. They will be prepared and processed following normal due diligence \nand processing requirements under ADB\u2019s NSO processes. Qualifying criteria for projects under \nthe Program consist of the following: \n \n(i)  The project scope includes renewable energy generation and supports energy \nsector infrastructure.13 \n(ii)  The project is in a PDMC. \n(iii)  Projects that fall under environment category A are excluded. \n                                                \n13 Supporting infrastructure includes the required power sector infrastructure to maintain grid operation. This includes, \nbut is not limited to, transmission and distribution assets and diesel generation rehabilitation and upgrades. \n ", "7 \n \n(iv)  The total ADB NSO exposure is limited to $10 million per project, consisting of a \ncombination of direct NSO loans and an amount of PRG exposure. The financing \nparameters  for  individual  transactions  will  be  approved  in  accordance  with \nguidelines under Operations Manual section D10 (Nonsovereign Operations). \n \n22.  ADB will report progress  in Program implementation annually to the ADB Board of \nDirectors (calendar year). The first annual report will be for the period March\u2013December 2019 \nand will be due in April 2020. Prior to 30 September 2021 or when 50% of the approval limit has \nbeen utilized, whichever occurs first, ADB will conduct an interim review of the Program and report \nto the Board, including recommendations for design modifications (if any). \n \n23.  PSOD  and  PARD  will  work  closely  with  PDMCs\u2019  power  utilities  to  identify  suitable \ntransactions and propose transaction advisory services to OPPP (in close coordination with AP3F \nfor TA support). PSOD will oversee the implementation, monitor the progress of the portfolio and \nrespond to any issues arising in the guarantee transaction, and prepare periodic Program \nprogress reports to donors as required.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n24.  ADB will establish a loan and guarantee program that includes PRGs to cover default on \ncommercial loans for qualifying projects caused by restrictions on convertibility and transferability, \npolitical violence, expropriation, and breach of contract (including failure by the utility to make a \ntermination payment in the event of full default by the power utility, as set out in the PPA). ADB\u2019s \nPRGs may benefit from risk transfer arrangements, as appropriate and available, with third-party \nconcessional funds. Such funds will risk-participate with ADB, who will act as guarantor of record. \nAdditionally, nonsovereign loans, or equivalent  PRGs to intermediary lenders,  may directly \nsupport IPPs. Finally, TA for project origination and transaction advisory support will be made \navailable to assist governments in streamlined processing (standardization of PPAs, bidding \ndocuments, and bid process) to reduce high transaction costs associated with relatively small \ntransaction sizes in the Pacific. In addition to the core OCR elements of the Program, ADB will \nseek to bring additional value to the Program by arranging for the benefit of IPPs, where \nappropriate and available, an LC standby support for power payments due in the event of a breach \nof payment obligations by the offtaker under the PPA. The extent of the cover of debt service \nunder such LC will differ from project to project based on the credit standing of each offtaker and \nthe extent to which concessional funding sources support the use of funds for such a purpose. \nAn LC will reduce the risk to commercial lenders of borrower default under the PPA, and thus \nreduce the cost of funds to the IPP. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s assistance through the Program is crucial in creating an enabling environment and \nlowering barriers to promote private sector investment. The Program is an output indicator of \nPREIF and fulfils a gap identified by the PREIF. The Program will benefit from the energy sector \nreform under the PREIF and build on synergies with ADB\u2019s sovereign energy projects in the \nregion. The Program will improve transparency and governance through upstream TA to identify \nprojects, provide transaction advisory services, and support sector reform to promote the private \nsector.  \n \n ", "8   \nC.  Risks and Mitigations \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \n26.  Environment and Social Safeguards. The Program will support renewable energy \nprojects, each of which will be separately assessed and processed depending on the financial \nstructure (i.e. LC and PRG, or in combination with a nonsovereign loan). Desk environmental and \nsocial  screening  will  be  conducted  for  each  transaction  to  determine  the  significance  of \nenvironmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples risks and impacts. Projects \ncategorized as Category A for environment will not be included in the Program. Projects under \nthe Program are anticipated to be Environment Category B, Involuntary Resettlement Category \nB, and Indigenous Peoples Category C.  \n \n27.  Environmental and social due diligence will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and social requirements. The IPPs will engage environmental \nand social experts to prepare environmental and social assessment reports and management \nplans for their projects, such as an Initial Environmental Examination report and Resettlement \nPlan (if required). An Environmental and Social Audit report to be filed by an external expert will \nassess the environmental, social, health and safety, and gender risks and impacts associated \nwith  the  project  in  cases  where  the  project  involves  land  acquisition  or  resettlement. \nRecommended mitigation measures and monitoring requirements will be implemented under an \nenvironmental and social management plan. The Implementation of any corrective action plans \nin response to audit findings will also be monitored by and reported to ADB.  \n \n28.  Transactions with an NSO loan component will be processed in line with project finance \ntransactions wherein preparation, review and approval of environmental and social requirements \nwill be conducted prior to approval by the ADB Management. For projects benefiting only from a \nPRG, compliance with safeguards and social requirements will be a condition precedent for the \navailability of the guarantees to the IPPs or partner financial institutions. \n \n29.  Social dimensions. The Program is categorized as having no gender element given the \nnature of the Program. Each project approved under the Program will aim to achieve some gender \nelements.
