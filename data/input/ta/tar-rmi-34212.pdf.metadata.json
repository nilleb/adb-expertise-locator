During the 2000 country programming mission and subsequent consultation missions, \nthe Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) requested Asian Development \nBank (ADB) assistance for a project in support of social sector development. This was included \nin ADB\u2019s program for consideration by the Board in the year 2004. During the Fact-Finding \nMission of 25 February to 8 March 2003, an understanding was reached with the Government \non  the  technical  assistance  (TA)1  objectives,  scope,  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements. The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over the last 15 years  the RMI economy has been stagnant despite relatively large \nannual transfers of aid from the United States (US) under the first Compact of Free Association. \nThe unemployment rate is consequently high at around 30%, and increasing, yet the country is \nrecruiting overseas to fill qualified positions. For several generations, the population has been \naccustomed  to  being  provided  for  by  the  US  administration  and,  more  recently,  by  the \nGovernment. A top-down, supply-driven, approach to social service delivery has resulted in a \nstate  of  apathy  and  sense  of  dependency  across  the  society.  The  1999  Pacific  Human \nDevelopment Report ranks the RMI 8th (down from 5th in 1994) among the 12 Pacific developing \nmember countries (PDMCs) in terms of poverty. The low ranking of the RMI reflects the reality \nthat one in four of the population is illiterate, almost one child in five is underweight, and almost \none household in five does not have access to safe water. \n \n3.  In the 1980s, the RMI had one of the highest population growth rates in the world. The \nrate has decreased, from 4.2% per annum to 1.5% per annum in 1999 due to a slight decrease \nin natural growth, and very substantial out-migration. Although the average woman is now \nbearing fewer children in her lifetime, each  year the cohort of fertile women increases. With \n42.9% of the population under the age of 15 in the 1999 census, this trend is likely to continue \nover the next decade, and has serious consequences in social stability, health services, and \neducation. On the other hand, the youth of the RMI, represent a sizable resource for the future \nof the country.  \n \n4.  The capacity of the education system has not kept pace with the rapid increase of the \nschool-age  population.  Private  schools  ease  the  pressure  on  the  public  system,  but  are \nrelatively expensive. The quality of education is very low. Many elementary school age children \ndo not attend school, for lack of space or because the school is far from their homes. Poor \nstudent attendance is also linked to the broader issue of weak parenting capabilities. The major \nchallenge faced by the education system is poor teachers\u2019 qualifications. Only 57% of teachers \nare high school graduates. Capacities in English and math are particularly low. However, even a \nlarge investment in the education supply would not guarantee a substantial improvement in \neducational outcomes in the absence of a broader approach taking in account the demand for \neducation. \n \n5.  Children in large families and those of teenage and young mothers often do not receive \nthe  individual  care  they  need.  About  44%  of  the  school  children  in  grades  1  and  2  are \nmalnourished in Ebeye. Nutritional problems are another consequence of the lack of education \nand passivity of the population. Of hospital admissions in Majuro, 75% are linked to diabetes. \nDiabetes is affecting people at increasingly  younger ages, which will have serious economic \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 12 February 2003.  ", "2  \nconsequences, both in terms of health costs and loss of productivity of the workforce. However, \nhealth education and promotion campaigns conducted in the past decade with ADB support2 \nhave improved the understanding of noncommunicable diseases among the population, and this \nshould be reinforced and encouraged within the youth age group.  \n \n6.  In recent years the migration of many Marshallese to the urban population centers of \nMajuro and Ebeye and the consequent increased exposure to non-Marshallese values and \nculture have helped weaken the traditional cultural norms and organization that have been \ncentral to Marshallese society.  The lack of education, rapid urbanization of the population, \nerosion  of  traditional  social  structures  and  breakdown  in  family  discipline,  crowded  living \nconditions, high proportion of young people, and high drop out rate from school,3 are leading to \nincreasing social problems, notably alcohol and drug abuse, youth suicides, and teenage \npregnancies. The number of criminal offenses is on the rise, and over 40% of the arrested \npeople are age 19 or under. One third of alcohol- and drug-related problems are among minors. \nThe emergence of youth gangs is now a well identified, albeit worrying, phenomenon. The most \nvulnerable youth are those who are neither employed nor in school. \n   \n7.  The  issues  the  country  faces  with  regard  to  youth  are  particularly  complex.  Their \nsolutions require a demand-driven approach rather than a supply-driven one, which has failed in \nthe past. Promoting the participation of the youth and communities in shaping policies and \nmonitoring youth-targeted public expenditure is essential. Youth disadvantages derive from lack \nof (i) economic assets, leading to income generation; (ii) social access to information, social \ncapital, free-time activities, cultural expression, educational opportunities, care, and mentoring \nin youth friendly venues; and (iii) participation in decision-making.  Youth inclusion policies are \nmore effective if the different dimensions are combined, rather than having fragmented sectoral \ninterventions. Youth concerns need to be addressed at a macro level and to appear in a more \nprominent way in planning economic development, and not be perceived as a set of small-scale \ntargeted interventions. \n \n8.  The RMI Government produces a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) which \nreceived assistance from ADB TA.4 ADB TA has also sought to improve public expenditure \nmanagement (PEM) by integrating a gender and youth perspective into the  Government\u2019s \nbudget policies. A sound PEM system and a good understanding of how input affects outcome \nis expected to improve the status of women and youth through efficient and equitable resource \nallocation. The TA focuses on gender in the RMI and youth in Samoa.5 \n \n9.  The ADB strategy for the RMI focuses on (i) private market and job creation by helping \nto improve the environment for private sector development; (ii) improved delivery of essential \npublic goods and services; and (iii) strengthening of central governance in support of private \nand public sector productivity. ADB is committed to implementing this strategy in a participatory \nmanner to encourage ownership and commitment in support of developing a new social and \neconomic  order.  Other  funding  agencies,  mainly  from  Japan;  Taipei,China;  and  US  are \nfinancing infrastructure investments; thus, ADB\u2019s strategy complements other assistance.  \n \n \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1994.

The TA will assist the Government in (i) strengthening and refocusing public sector \npolicies,  management,  and  public  expenditure  on  priority  issues  affecting  the  youth,  in  a \nparticipatory manner; and (ii) assessing the feasibility of, and preparing, a youth social services \nproject, to finance the assistance and investments required to address these priorities. The \nobjective of the Project will be to reduce poverty among the youth, by encouraging the demand \nfor and development of youth-specific services and facilities by nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and the Government, and by improving the relevance and effectiveness of the services. \nThe TA will focus on organizational, institutional concerns, and target employability, social skills, \nand a social support system for the youth. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. Phase I will use a participatory approach \ntoward budget formulation to (i) prioritize public expenditures, determining focal areas (including \ninstitutional  and  management  concerns)  and  strategic  interventions;  and  (ii)  subsequently \ndevelop a multiyear  MTEF for youth-oriented services, identifying investment and recurrent \ncosts over a 5-year period. Phase 2 will prepare the investment component of MTEF for \npossible ADB financing.  \n \n12.  The main objectives of the phased approach are (i) targeting of the Government\u2019s \nbudget  toward  pressing  social  issues,  and  better  allocation  of  resources;  (ii)  improved \nunderstanding of these issues by central agencies; (iii) active participation of different groups in \nthe community, including parents and elders, in formulating and monitoring the budget; (iv) \nimproved management and supervision, and therefore, productivity of the resources allocated; \n(v) further examination of institutional arrangements and service delivery mechanisms, possibly \nincluding  communities,  NGOs,  and  linkage  with  relevant  public  agencies;  (vi)  pooling  of \nresources for cross ministry projects; and (vii) obtaining of the commitment of the communities \nand demand for better public services delivery.  \n \n13.  Phase 1: Prioritization of Public Expenditure for the Youth.  Building (i) on the policy \ndialogue among the Ministry of Finance, key spending ministries, and youth and women\u2019s \norganizations  strengthened  or  set  up  during  the  implementation  of  the  TA  on  Youth-and \nGender-sensitive Public Expenditure Management; and (ii) on the result of the participatory \npoverty assessment, phase 1 will (i) prepare an analysis of stakeholders and participatory \nneeds, institutional response, and youth services; and (ii) select areas of policy and institutional \nfocus and strategic interventions, based on the analysis,  and identified priorities, which will \ninvolve  building  a  consensus  on  youth  and  social  issues  within  both  government  and \nnongovernment sectors. \n \n14.  A  MTEF  for  youth-oriented services, will then be formulated through a participatory \napproach involving NGOs and civil society groups. The MTEF will clearly identify recurrent and \ninvestment costs for setting up adequate youth services and programs.   \n \n15.  Coordination with the recently established Economic Policy, Planning and Statistic Office \n(EPPSO) will be critical. The possibility of involving the EPPSO task force to assess data and \nstatistics, and to analyze youth roles in activities supported by the budget process and the ", "4  \nimpact of delivery mechanisms, will be discussed. The need for additional capacities in EPPSO \nwill  also  be  assessed,  and  how  social  participation  indicators  can  be  included  in  the \nmeasurement  systems  required  for  the  performance  budgeting.  Providing  monitoring  and \ncommunication tools to the Government for the \u201cperformance budget\u201d on priority issues such as \nyouth development (including education, health, and nutrition) will be part of the Project. \n \n16.  The Project will particularly (but not necessarily exclusively) target out-of-school youth to \ncreate a more supportive environment for skill building through innovative, nonformal education. \nThis can include the following:  \n \n(i)  Local programs that teach life skills. The goals are to (a) provide the youth \nwith permanent skills that will empower them to become competent, confident, \nresponsible, and caring adults; (b) build the skills or opportunities to contribute \ntoward  their  taking  positive  roles  in  their  communities,  and  (c)  develop \nemployability skills, and learn how to think creatively on the job. \n  \n(ii)  Youth participation and service to their communities. Peer education (by the \nyouth  for  the  youth)  can  be  an  effective  way  of  providing  the  youth  with \ninformation, motivation, and life skills especially in relation to sensitive issues \n(e.g., sexuality and substance use).  Through such opportunities, young people \ncome to think of themselves as stakeholders in society, with a positive attitude \ntoward active citizenship. Perhaps most importantly, a young person who feels \nhe or she has something to offer also feels a sense of belonging and a sense of \nworth\u2014so critical to his or her positive growth and development. \n \n(iii)  Youth organizations providing information. Promoting socialization will be \nsupported. \n \n17.  Phase  2:  Preparation  of  the  Investment  Component.  Phase  2  will  assist  the \nGovernment to prepare a Project, to finance the development of youth services and facilities \nwithin  the  framework  of  the  MTEF.  This  phase  will  notably  involve  (i)  estimation  and \nprioritization of the need for additional investments, including training, capacity building, and \ninstitutional development; (ii) preparation of policy recommendations to enhance the youth \nsocial services; (iii) design of effective delivery systems social services to the youth through the \nparticipation of communities; and (iv) evaluation of the cost and identification of the modalities of \nimplementation to be supported by the proposed Project. Phase 2 will involve a  participatory \napproach under which stakeholders define priorities and corresponding activities as they gain \nexperience. Beneficiary involvement in the Project\u2019s development is critical to ensure that their \nneeds and views are taken into account. \n \n18.  The need for capacity building in civil society organizations, local governments, and \ncentral Government agencies will have to be carefully assessed. The proposition to create a \ncenter for sustainable community-based development in the College of the Marshall Islands, as \nan information center for NGOs, and a center for training on issues of accountability, will have to \nbe evaluated. The link with a training institution can help to ensure the sustainability of the \nlearning process. \n \n19.  Improving the productivity of Government service delivery may involve out-sourcing a \nnumber of activities to NGOs. Some NGOs are already successful in youth rehabilitation and \nskills development. This will be explored, and mechanisms designed to ensure a systematic \napproach by the Government, reinforcing the links between line ministries and civil society. ", "  5\n20.   The Project will take into account the nature of the Marshallese society, which tends to \nlimit the participation of the general community in the decision-making processes. \n     \nC.  Cost Financing  \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent including $447,000 in foreign exchange and $53,000 in local currency equivalent on \na grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The remaining \n$130,000 equivalent will be provided by the Government through the provision of counterpart \nstaff, support services, and office facilities. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nprovided in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing project. The expected loan amount for the Project is $5 \nmillion. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs, which has a unit on youth issues, will be the Executing \nAgency. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the Ministry of Finance to ensure \nthat youth issues are mainstreamed into general policies and budget work. The total duration of \nthe TA will be 10 months, beginning in November 2003.  \n \n23.  A team of international consultants with expertise in economics, public expenditure \nmanagement,  sociology,  participatory  processes,  and  youth  policy  development,  will  be \nrecruited through a firm for a total period of 17 person-months. The consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The quality- and cost-based \nselection method will be applied. Outline terms of reference are attached as Appendix 3. The TA \nwill provide for a series of workshops and consultative meetings in the atolls and islands, to \nensure (i) training on participatory budget techniques, and (ii) broad participation of stakeholders \nin the Project\u2019s design. \n \n24.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report, 1 month after TA commencement; (ii) \nan interim report at the end of phase 1; (iii) a draft final report 1 month prior to the end of the TA; \nand (iii) a final report within 2 months of TA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Marshall Islands for preparing the Youth Social Services Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring   \nMechanisms  Risks \nGoal       \n     \nReduce poverty among the youth, by  \u2022  Increased percentage of  National statistics on \nencouraging the demand for and  youth remaining in education.   \u2022  labor force, \ndevelopment of youth-specific services  Decrease of drop-out before  \u2022  employment, \nand facilities by nongovernment  grade 7, from 30% to 20%  \u2022  education, \norganizations (NGOs) and the  and from 60% before grade 9  \u2022  crime, \nGovernment, and by improving the  to 50%.  \u2022  health. \nrelevance and cost-effectiveness of  \u2022  Increased number of youth \nservices. \nemployed, reducing rate of \n \nunemployment from 30% to \n25%. \n\u2022  Reduced youth crime, \nincluding elimination of youth \ngangs within 5 years. \n\u2022  Reduction in teenage \npregnancies from 22% to 15% \nwithin 5 years. \n \nObjectives  \u2022  Participatory budget     \n  formulation task force or  \u2022 Report of the  \u2022 Limited capacity \n\u2022 Strengthen and refocus public sector  committee, including NGOs,  youth Republic of  to reallocate \npolicies, management, and public  established.

The  team  of  consultants  (17  person-months)  should  have  advanced  degrees  in \neconomics and sociology, as appropriate, with well-developed analytical and quantitative skills. \nThe consultants should also have experience in applying these skills to policy and institutional \nissues in the field of \u201cpeople-centered\u201d budgets, as well as specific expertise in youth-sensitive \npublic expenditure analysis and participatory budgeting. Experience in training and familiarity \nwith budget systems in developing countries is required, as well as extensive experience with \nyouth policy and development projects. The team will work with (and report to) the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs. Consultation and coordination will be ensured with other agencies (notably the \nministries  of  finance  for  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  [MTEF],  resources  and \ndevelopment, education, health, and environment), nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the \nprivate sector, and other funding agencies.  \n \n2.  The proposed Project will address issues within a strategic framework that matches the \nGovernment\u2019s  plans,  and  is  consistent  with  the  approach  and  findings  of  the  technical \nassistance (TA) on Youth- and Gender-Sensitive Public Expenditure Management in the Pacific.  \n \n3.

Phase 1 \n \n4.  Phase 1 will prioritize public expenditures and improved service delivery, determining \nfocal areas and strategic interventions. Phase 1 will then develop a multiyear spending program \nin the form of a MTEF for youth-oriented services, identifying both investment and recurrent \ncosts over a 5-year period. Consultants\u2019 specific tasks during phase 1 will include the following: \n \n(i)  Further  assess  the  nature  and  degree  of  issues  affecting  the  youth  through  a \nparticipatory  process  to  prepare  a  stakeholders  and  needs  analysis  for  youth \nservices, identifying the causal relationship of youth exclusion factors. \n \n(ii)  Facilitate dialogue between the youth and leaders on these issues. \n \n(iii)  Promote the youth issues as a high priority at the political and budgetary decision-\nmaking level.  \n \n(iv)  Stimulate a dialogue on governance issues among the youth by emphasizing the role \nthey can play in demanding accountability from their Government. \n \n(v)  Based on the analysis of the Republic of the Marshall Islands\u2019 (RMI\u2019s) national \nbudget and data available through the TA  on youth- and gender-sensitive public \nexpenditure management in the Pacific, develop a framework within which new \nactivities  can  be  identified  and  financed,  within  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic \nframework. This will encompass four main activities: \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n(a)  Analyze the share of the different Government sectors defined according to \ntheir impact on the youth and prioritize the budget allocation, disaggregating \nprojected expenditure into age-relevant  categories  and  developing  youth-\nsensitive goals and indicators of success. \n \n(b)  Organize participation of community groups in developing youth policies and \nprograms,  to  help  the  Government  select  areas  of  policy  focus  and \ninstitutional  improvement  and  other  interventions  on  the  basis  of  an \nintegrated  approach  between  Government  departments  and  various \ncommunity sectors. \n \n(c)  Review  institutional  arrangements  and  service  delivery  mechanisms, \nincluding possible future operational linkage of communities and NGOs with \nrelevant public agencies. \n \n(d)  Develop a MTEF focused on youth programs, including (i) cost estimates of \nongoing and new programs; (ii) required savings on existing programs, and \nbudget reallocations required to ensure better efficiency; and (iii) finances \nallocated to new programs. The MTEF will envisage both recurrent and \ninvestment  expenditure.  The  period  covered  should  be  5  years  for  the \ninvestment component.  \n \n(vi)  Assess the need for additional capacities in the Economic Policy, Planning and \nStatistics Office (EPPSO) to (a) assess data, availability of age-group statistics, and \ngaps in their generation and use; and (b) analyze youth roles and responsibilities in \nactivities supported by the budget process. \n \n(vii)  Assess how social participation indicators can be included in the measurement \nsystems for performance budgeting. \n \n(viii)  Establish  monitoring  and  communication  tools  for  the  \u201cperformance  budget\u201d  on \npriority issues such as youth development, including independent public budget \nassessments with a youth perspective and periodic public opinion surveys on budget \nexpenditures at community level. \n \n(ix)  The scope of the TA will particularly (but not exclusively) target out-of-school youth to \ncreate a more supportive environment for skill building through innovative, nonformal \neducation.  \n \nB.  Phase 2: Preparation of the Investment Component \n \n5.  On the basis of the investment financing needs identified in the MTEF, the consultant\u2019s \nspecific tasks during phase 2 will assist the Government to prepare a Project, that will finance \nthe investments required to develop youth services and facilities within the framework of the \nMTEF.  Project preparation will involve (i) estimation and prioritization of the needs for additional \ninvestments, including training, capacity building, and institutional development; (ii) preparation \nof the policy recommendations to enhance the social services for the youth; (iii) design of \neffective  delivery  systems  for  social  services  to  the  youth  through  the  participation  of \ncommunities; and (iv) evaluation of the cost and feasibility, and identification of the modalities of \nimplementation to be supported by the ensuing project. Project preparation will involve a ", "  Appendix  3  11 \nparticipatory approach under which stakeholders define priorities and corresponding activities \nas they gain experience.  \n \n6.  The project\u2019s design activities will include \n \n(i)  developing a logical framework for the proposed project. \n(ii)  identifying the detailed cost of the activities and investments covered by the \nproposed Project. \n(iii)  preparing the monitoring and evaluation of the proposed Project. \n(iv)  conducting the economic analysis of the proposed project, and \n(v)  preparing the terms of reference for TA required.
