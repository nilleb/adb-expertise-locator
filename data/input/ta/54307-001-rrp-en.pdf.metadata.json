THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Sustainable Economic Recovery Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based  loan (PBL)  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for subprogram  1  of the \nSustainable  Economic  Recovery  Program.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Supporting the Sustainable Economic Recovery Program, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n2.  The program focuses on sustainable economic recovery following the severe health, and \ndemand and supply shocks triggered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It \npursues reforms in two areas: public financial management (PFM), and access to finance for the \nunderserved market segments, mainly cottage, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(CMSMEs). The PFM reforms will help create the fiscal space needed to boost investment in \ncritical  physical  and  social  infrastructure.  Broadening  access  to  finance  will  help  revitalize \nCMSMEs, which is crucial not only for preserving employment and livelihoods but also for \nstrengthening production networks throughout the value chain. The program will be implemented \nduring 2021\u20132023.1 A programmatic approach with two subprograms of $250 million each is \nproposed  for  the  sequential  reforms,  which  were  determined  in  policy  dialogues  with  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh on post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Subprogram 1 focuses on \nimmediate  policy  actions  relating  to  domestic  resource  mobilization  (DRM),  expenditure \nmanagement, and CMSMEs to help drive the near-term economic recovery. Subprogram 2 \nfocuses on further advancing these agendas while also building the capacities of government \nagencies to operationalize the reforms and shaping longer-term reform strategies and plans. The \nattached TA will support the government in building capacity and implementing sequential policy \nactions under the second subprogram. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will also engage in \na dialogue with the government on development of the government\u2019s medium-term revenue \nstrategy (MTRS) through ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Tax Hub. \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Bangladesh has emerged as one of the fastest-growing developing economies, sustaining \naverage growth rates of 6.7% from fiscal year (FY) 2011 to FY2020, and drastically reducing \npoverty levels from 48.9% in 2000 to 20.5% in 2019, thereby lifting more than 29 million people \nout  of  grinding  poverty.2 This  rapid  development  was  mainly  driven  by  manufacturing-led \neconomic transformation\u2014especially in the export-oriented ready-made garment industry\u2014and \nlarge inflows of remittances that supported private consumption and helped maintain external \nsector stability. Bangladesh crossed the World Bank\u2019s lower middle-income country threshold in \n2015 and met the United Nations\u2019 eligibility criteria to graduate from the least-developed country \nstatus, potentially in 2026. Bangladesh aims to end extreme poverty and become an upper \nmiddle-income country by 2031, and a developed country by 2041.3 \n \n1  The policy design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Based on the national poverty line. The Eighth Five Year Plan (footnote 4) expects it to decline to 15.6% by FY2025. \nGovernment of Bangladesh. 2019. Bangladesh Statistics 2019. Dhaka. \n3  Government of Bangladesh. 2020. Making Vision 2041 a Reality: Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2021-2041. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \n4.  The economy is undergoing structural changes that favor a labor-intensive manufacturing \nindustry. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), agriculture and services have been \ndeclining: agriculture from 17.8% in FY2010 to 13.6% in FY2019, and services from 56.0% to \n51.8% in the same period. By contrast, industry expanded from 26.0% of GDP in FY2010 to \n34.6% of GDP in FY2019, to which manufacturing contributed 23.2% (17.0% in FY2010). The \ngovernment\u2019s latest medium-term plan underscores the critical role of industry, particularly labor-\nintensive manufacturing, in spearheading the economic transformation and absorbing the surplus \nlabor released by agriculture and services, whose share is expected to shrink further in the \nmedium-term.  Industry  is  expected  to  reach  41.9%  by  FY2025  (30.2%  of  which  from \nmanufacturing), from 35.4% in FY2020, which will contribute to faster enterprise formalization, \nbetter jobs, and increasing revenue generation. \n5.  Development  challenges.  Bangladesh  faces  several  key  development  challenges, \nincluding (i) infrastructure and skills gaps, (ii) narrow economic base, (iii) stagnant private \ninvestment, (iv) weak institutional and project implementation capacity, and (v) low educational \nquality. Exports are narrowly based\u2014ready-made garments account for 84% of total exports. The \neconomic transformation envisioned in the Eighth Five Year Plan requires massive investment in \nphysical and social infrastructure to boost productivity.4 As a share of GDP, public investment \nmust increase by about 1.2 percentage points by FY2025 (and private investment by about \n3.8 percentage points) compared with FY2020, when aggregate investment was 31.8% of GDP \n(23.6% from the private sector and 8.1% from the public sector). \n6.  Economic  and  social  setbacks  because  of  COVID-19.  The  COVID-19  pandemic \nderailed  the  otherwise  impressive  economic  growth  and  social  progress  momentum  in \nBangladesh. GDP grew at 3.5% in FY2020, against the pre-pandemic target of 8.2%. The \nprovisional growth rate for FY2021 is 5.5%, as against ADB\u2019s projection of 5.8%.5 The sharp \ndeceleration in FY2020, followed by at least 2 more years of the pandemic during FY2021 and \nFY2022, created significant downside risks to the achievement of the government\u2019s ambitious \nprojection\u20148.0% average annual growth during FY2021\u2013FY2025. The fiscal deficit is expected \nto overshoot the government\u2019s customary target of 5.0% of GDP at least until FY2023, owing to \nlow DRM and high spending on relief and recovery measures. Based on the national measure, \nthe poverty incidence is expected to have increased to 23.0% in FY2021, from 20.5% in FY2019. \nThe pandemic pushed many CMSMEs to the verge of bankruptcy and precipitated the breakdown \nof upstream and downstream production networks. Because of the deteriorating asset quality and \nhigher credit risk perception, financial institutions are reluctant to extend credit. Unemployment \nalso surged from 2.1% in March 2020 to 22.4% in April\u2013July 2020, before declining to 3.8% by \nSeptember  2020.6 CMSMEs  owned  by  women,  predominantly  microbusinesses  in  animal \nfarming, trading, and services, are comparatively more affected because of their informal nature, \nthe owners' weak financial literacy, and lack of sufficient assets to offer as collateral. \n7.  Countercyclical  policies.  The  government  introduced  an  effective  countercyclical \neconomic stimulus to stabilize economic activities, which increased the fiscal deficit, estimated at \n6.1% of GDP in FY2021, because of the unprecedented increase in expenditure. Fiscal stimulus \nrelated to social protection and relief for the private sector totaled about 4.3% of the forecast \n \n4  Government of Bangladesh. 2020.

Binding constraints to increased public investment. The two key constraints to more \npublic investment in critically needed physical and social infrastructure are (i) persistently low \nDRM and (ii) inefficient use of public resources. Total tax revenue was just 8.1% of GDP in \nFY2020 (down from 8.9% in FY2019 because of the pandemic).9 Bangladesh\u2019s revenue collection \ncompares poorly with that of its peers.10 The tax collection in FY2019 is much lower than projected \nin the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2010\u20132021 (15.8% by FY2019) and the Seventh Five Year \nPlan, FY2016\u2013FY2020 (13.1% by FY2019).11 Cost and time overruns in capital investment \nprojects, inconsistency between development and nondevelopment budgets, and large subsidies \nto  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  are  the  most  significant  issues  in  public  expenditure \nmanagement. \n9.  Causes of low domestic resource mobilization. The underlying causes of low DRM \ninclude a narrow tax base, lack of compliance coupled with weak enforcement, large-scale \nexemptions, and a weak and outdated tax administration. Only about 47% of taxpayers with \ntaxpayer identification numbers file income tax returns, and less than 3% of the population pays \nincome tax. Forgone revenue from tax exemptions was estimated at 2.1% of GDP in FY2018 by \nthe National Board of Revenue (NBR).12 The filing and handling of income tax returns, as well as \ntax payments, are still largely manual and paper-based processes, increasing the time and cost \nof tax administration. Value-added tax (VAT) payments are also made offline. Despite accounting \nfor 58% of the income tax collected, withholding tax is managed inefficiently and the reconciliation \nof amounts collected and amounts deposited is weak, which increases the risks of leakage. A \nlack of information sharing between the NBR's income tax and VAT divisions hampers efficient \nand quality risk-based auditing. \n10.  Inefficiencies in public expenditure. Public expenditure accounted for 15.3% of GDP in \nFY2020, comprising 6.7% in development expenditure, 8.6% in nondevelopment expenditure. \nThe separation of the annual development program (ADP) budget and the nondevelopment \nbudget leads to weak control over the sizable project recurrent costs (included in the development \nproject documents). This often results in fund shortages for well-performing projects but unspent \nfunds under nonperforming projects. The lack of an effective mechanism and inadequate capacity \nto properly identify, appraise, approve, and execute projects have led to allocative inefficacies, \nweak project readiness, and low project quality at entry, which in turn resulted in startup delays, \n \n7  https://covid19policy.adb.org/policy-measures/BAN (accessed 17 May 2021). The government has 17 schemes \ntotaling Tk384 billion, such as an enhanced agricultural subsidy (Tk95 billion); a special fund for salary support to \nworkers in export-oriented manufacturing units (Tk50 billion); low-interest loans to poor rural farmers, expatriate \nmigrant workers, and trained youth and unemployed youth (Tk32 billion); and free food distribution to the poor who \nhave suddenly become jobless (Tk25 billion). \n8  With the regulatory forbearance in place, the gross nonperforming loan ratio declined to 7.7% as of 31 December \n2020, from 8.8% as of 31 December 2019 (Banking Regulation and Policy Department, Bangladesh Bank). \n9  Taxes  account  for  90%  of  total  revenues.  Income  taxes  accounted  for  35%,  value-added  tax  (VAT)  and \nsupplementary duty for about 53%, and export and import duties for 11% of tax revenues. \n10 International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

Washington, DC: Center for Global Development (January, p. 24). \n ", "4 \nand cost and time overruns in capital investment projects (cost overruns average about 30%, time \noverruns average 3 years). Poor procurement and contract management performance, with \nlimited autonomy for the Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), lack of integration between \nthe integrated budget management system (iBAS++) and the electronic government procurement \n(e-GP) system, and lack of electronic contract management, also contribute to these outcomes. \nOnly about 15% of the benefits transferred under the social safety net programs are through the \ngovernment-to-person digital platform; the rest are subject to a time-consuming bureaucratic \nprocess with potential for leakages. SOEs' performance cannot be assessed reliably, nor can \nfiscal risk and contingent liabilities be estimated accurately in the absence of a standard policy for \nthe more than 60 SOEs. \n11.  Strengthening public financial management. The government has been implementing \nthe PFM reform action plan since 2018, formulated to address the findings of the 2016 public \nexpenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment of Bangladesh\u2019s PFM system, which \nidentified progress but also weaknesses still persisting in several areas since the 2010 PEFA \nassessment.13 The PFM reform action plan lists 14 critical components and prioritizes the need to \nrectify their weaknesses to achieve a sound PFM regime. Among the key hurdles to better PFM \nperformance are (i) weak revenue and expenditure estimates; (ii) low tax base and coverage; (iii) \nabsence  of  an  MTRS  and  medium-term  debt  strategy;  (iv)  inefficient  public  investment \nmanagement (PIM); (v) weak performance of public sector management; (vi) fragmentation of \ndevelopment and nondevelopment budgets; (vii) lack of sound governance at SOEs, and in \nexternal and internal audits; (viii) lack of digitalization of public procurement and monitoring; and \n(viv) lack of clarity on the leadership structure for PFM reforms. \n12.  Progress in public financial management reform. The report on PFM reform progress \nnotes moderate performance in respect of revenue and expenditure forecasting, DRM, debt \nmanagement, planning and budget preparation, and PIM; and weak performance in respect of \npublic sector performance management, financial reporting and strengthening of parliamentary \noversight,  and  scrutiny  of  public  expenditure. 14  The  report  stresses  the  importance  of \nstrengthening DRM by enabling tax data sharing between the NBR\u2019s different divisions, meeting \nthe  NBR\u2019s  equipment  and  logistical  needs,  enhancing  the  capacity  of  its  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) personnel, and ensuring the sustainability of its ICT systems. In \nthe area of expenditure management, the progress report notes that improving the efficiency of \ndevelopment budget management and ensuring the quality of portfolio performance in capital \ninvestment projects remain key challenges. ADB and other development partners are helping to \ntackle these PFM constraints. Paras. 18\u201325 detail ADB\u2019s policy-based lending program, while \ninitiatives of other development partners are summarized in para. 30. \n13.  Challenges to the development of small businesses. Limited access to affordable \nfinance is one of the most critical constraints faced by CMSMEs. Only 28% of the larger CMSMEs, \ni.e., small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have bank loans. Banks are reluctant to lend to \nCMSMEs because of higher administrative costs, lower credit quality, insufficient fixed assets as \ncollateral, asymmetric information associated with poor financial records, and unavailability of \nquality and reliable business plans. Cottage and microenterprises in the rural areas lack access \nto formal bank credit and are compelled to borrow at higher costs from microfinance institutions \n(MFIs) or informal nonbanking channels, as they do not have sufficient managerial resources, or \nadequate collateral, even if they have a good business plan and execution capacity.15 MFIs may \nfind it more difficult to mobilize bank financing in the post-COVID-19 recovery phase because of \n \n13 Government of Bangladesh. 2016.

Washington, DC. \n ", "5 \nbanks\u2019 balance sheet constraints. An often excessive regulatory burden, poor market access, lack \nof  a  business  incubation  facility,  and  unavailability  of  cluster  or  value  chain  financing  are \nsignificant  impediments.  The  market  infrastructure  is  inadequate  to  reduce  asymmetric \ninformation and decrease transaction costs for cash-flow-based lending. Key ingredients are \nlacking, such as a credit guarantee mechanism, a functioning credit information bureau accessible \nfor both banks and MFIs to enable efficient risk-based pricing, and an effective regulatory \nframework for secured transactions that would allow using movable assets as collateral. The \nchallenges in accessing formal credit are compounded for businesses managed by women since \nthey are concentrated in informal microenterprises, lack financial literacy and networks, lack \ncollateral, and have limited access to information on government schemes.16 \n14.  Medium-term  development  and  COVID-19  recovery  strategy.  The  government\u2019s \nEighth Five Year Plan (FY2021\u2013FY2025), prepared in 2020 and reflecting the post-COVID-19 \nrecovery strategy, aims to enhance real GDP growth from 5.2% in FY2020 to 8.5% in FY2025, \nand to reduce the incidence of poverty from 23.0% in FY2021 to 15.6% by FY2025. It targets a \nfiscal deficit of 5% of GDP over the medium-term, an annual inflation of 5.1%, and a moderate \nlevel of current account deficit to ensure external sector stability. At about 36% of GDP in FY2019, \noutstanding public debt is much lower than that of comparator economies but is expected to \nincrease given the expected widening of the fiscal deficit.17 Leveraging the COVID-19 crisis, the \ngovernment launched a major reform drive prioritizing DRM, other PFM areas, and the policy and \nbusiness environment for the development of CMSMEs. Specifically, the 8th plan aims to increase \nthe ratio of revenues to GDP from 9.5% in FY2020 to 14.1% in FY2025, while increasing public \ninvestments from 8.0% to 9.2% of GDP in the same period.18 The government initiated tax reforms \nto address the causes of low DRM: important among these are legal and procedural reforms \nrelated to VAT, income tax, and customs duties. The plan also aims to implement important \ninstitutional reforms, including strengthening and digitalizing tax administration and improving tax \ncollection efficiency. The government prepared the MTRS road map in 2018 with support from \nthe World Bank, which was endorsed by the steering committee in January 2020. The NBR \nestablished  an  implementation  team  and  a  secretariat.  The  MTRS  process,  which  gained \nmomentum after the stocktaking of ongoing reform initiatives, was slowed by the onset of COVID-\n19.19 \n15.  The 8th plan aims to raise total expenditure from 15.0% of GDP in FY2020 to 19.1% by \nFY2025. It prioritizes overhauling and rebuilding the health care system, improving education and \ntraining to build up human capital, and spending more to improve social protection, including \nincome  support  to  people  who  fell  back  into  poverty  because  of  the  pandemic.  The  plan \nemphasizes the importance of completing ongoing projects in the energy and transport sectors, \nand allocating more resources to agriculture and rural development and the implementation of \nthe Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. The 8th plan also underscores the need to significantly increase \nDRM and remove implementation constraints. About 80% of the plan\u2019s public investment program \nwill be financed by domestic sources\u201436% from public savings and 44% by domestic bank and \nnonbank sources.20 The MTRS and related fiscal reforms are expected to reverse the downward \ntrend of revenue and allow for a substantial expansion in the tax\u2013GDP ratio. More effective DRM \nwill provide the basis for enhancing the public expenditure program to meet the plan\u2019s key \ndevelopment priorities. While the fiscal deficit may widen until FY2023 because of the pandemic-\n \n16 Between 3% and 4% of the CMSMEs are led by women. \n17 In 2019, public debt as a percentage of GDP was 43.4% for Viet Nam and 36.9% for the Philippines. \n18 The Philippines achieved a ratio of public expenditure to GDP of 19.4%, and Viet Nam of 29.1%, in 2019. \n19 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (Public  Expenditure  and  Fiscal  Management) \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 This compares with the Seventh Five Year Plan target of 88% funding from domestic sources. \n ", "6 \nrelated expenditure, it is expected to contract in the later years of the plan thanks to better tax \nrevenue mobilization and prudent fiscal management. \n16.  Government\u2019s plan to foster small businesses. Since more than 70% of Bangladesh's \nCMSMEs are in rural areas and account for more than 80% of nonfarm employment, CMSMEs \nstrongly support rural development and poverty reduction.21 They can contribute to GDP growth, \nfrom the supply side, by producing goods and services for which there is demand. Higher \nspending by the workers (and their families) enabled by their continued (or restored) employment \nwill strengthen aggregate demand from the demand side. The interplay of demand and supply \nforces will create the required virtuous cycle to engineer a recovery. Recognizing CMSMEs' \nimportant position in the economy, the government is holistically promoting their development \nthrough the implementation of the National SME Policy 2019, which identifies several measures \nin the areas of access to finance, technology, market, and business development services. The \nEighth Five Year Plan gives strategic priority to the development of CMSMEs by enhancing credit \nto them, promoting digital commerce for SMEs, collaborating with MFIs and mobile operators to \noffer a digital credit score for SMEs, creating innovative financial solutions by involving ICT to \nimprove access to commercial bank credit, and devising credit guarantee schemes to reduce \ncredit risks and provide startup capital. \n17.  Alignment  with  Strategy  2030.  The  program  is  fully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh.22 It supports three of the seven operational \npriorities (OPs) of  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: OP1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities);  OP2  (accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality);  and  OP6  (strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity).23 Through the attached TA, the program will strengthen \nthe institutional capacity of PFM institutions, such as the Finance Division of the Ministry of \nFinance, the NBR, the Planning Commission, and Bangladesh Bank. The program will help \naugment public expenditure through stronger DRM and expenditure management, and will have \na positive impact on the poor, the vulnerable, and women by broadening access to credit for \nunderserved market segments. It will contribute to gender equality through earmarked access to \ncredit for women entrepreneurs. \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n18.  Policy reform.  The  program  envisages  a two-pronged  approach,  both  as  recovery \nmeasures and as a medium-term growth strategy: creating fiscal space for enhancing public \nexpenditure; and fostering CMSMEs\u2019 survival, recovery, and growth to create more employment \nopportunities. In the post-COVID-19 period, public expenditure must expand to accommodate \nhigher investments in education, health, social protection, and infrastructure development, which \nare essential to expedite the country's economic recovery and achieve higher, inclusive, and \nbroad-based growth. To implement this strategy in a fiscally sustainable manner, the program will \nfacilitate reforms in DRM and boost the allocative efficiency of public expenditure, including \n \n21 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (Inclusive Finance, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance and \nLeasing) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2016.

Increasing public expenditure requires tackling \nseveral PFM challenges. \n19.  The program is aligned with one of the core agendas of the Eighth Five Year Plan: to \nimplement reforms for rapid economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and generate \nemployment by stimulating economic activities (para. 14). The reforms under this PBL support \nsome of the plan's key priorities and will focus on two areas: \n20.  Reform area 1: Public financial management systems strengthened. These reforms \nfocus on improving DRM and expenditure management, and updating the PFM reform action \nplan.  \n21.  Under subprogram 1, to improve DRM, the government diversified the sources for deficit \nfinancing by issuing the Sukuk Investment Guidelines, which facilitate the issuance of sharia-\ncompliant treasury bonds.24 The government also launched measures to expand the taxpayer \nbase for income tax, improved services for marginal income taxpayers, digitalized VAT invoice \ngeneration through the use of electronic fiscal devices (EFDs), and enhanced information sharing \nbetween  the  NBR's  income  tax  and  VAT  divisions.  The  digitalization  of  withholding  tax \nmanagement  is  being  piloted  in  4  (of  29)  key  zones  in  Dhaka.  To  improve  expenditure \nmanagement,  the  government  introduced  a  policy  of  not  permitting  a  ministerial  annual \ndevelopment program (ADP) to exceed the initial budget allocations to line ministries. It also \nprogressively digitalized the disbursement of social protection benefits and closed down 25 loss-\nmaking jute mills.25 All subprogram 1 actions have been fully implemented. \n22.  Under subprogram 2, the reforms initiated under subprogram 1 will be deepened. DRM \nwill  be  enhanced through  expenditure  tracking  and  withdrawal  of  unproductive  income tax \nexemptions.26 The government will secure cabinet approval for a new income tax code, developed \nto address new and emerging issues such as transfer pricing, taxation of derivative transactions, \nbase erosion and profit shifting by global entities, and thin capitalization. Tax administration will \nbe strengthened by mainstreaming information sharing between the income tax and VAT divisions \nand by introducing risk-based audits. Tax administration will be digitalized by mandating online \npayments of income tax and VAT above certain minimum amounts, piloting online filing of income \ntax returns, and expanding the digitalization of withholding tax management to more zones. \nExpenditure management will be improved by merging the ADP and nondevelopment budgets \nand  issuing  a  unified  budget  circular  for  FY2024;  approving  the  restructuring,  closing,  or \nprivatizing  of  loss-making  sugar  mills  under  the  Bangladesh  Sugar  and  Food  Industries \nCorporation. To strengthen PIM and procurement, the government will fully implement the tools \nfor strengthening the quality of projects at entry, secure cabinet approval for the Bangladesh \nPublic Procurement Authority bill, integrate the electronic government procurement system (e-\nGP) with the iBAS++, and operationalize the electronic contract management system of e-GP. \nThe PEFA assessment will be updated to identify the progress made and the remaining PFM \nweaknesses, and the PFM reform action plan will be updated to address the identified deficiencies. \n23.  Reform area 2: Access to finance for underserved market segments improved.  \nThese reforms focus on strengthening affordable credit flows to CMSMEs for their survival and \n \n24 Against a target of at least one bond issuance, two bonds for a total of Tk80 billion were issued. \n25 Any budget increases for ongoing development projects should be financed through internal reallocations by the \nrespective ministry. \n26 The amendments will be submitted to the Parliament for approval. \n ", "8 \nrecovery, and facilitating enhanced market-based financial intermediation for CMSMEs' sustained \ngrowth and competitiveness. \n24.  Under subprogram 1, to strengthen credit flows to underserved CMSMEs (particularly \nthose  affected  by  the  pandemic),  ease  their  financial  conditions,  and  promote  enterprise \nformalization, Bangladesh Bank implemented a new refinancing scheme for low-income earners, \nfarmers, and marginal and/or micro businesses with an allocation of Tk30 billion (of which 25% is \nearmarked for women borrowers); Tk28 billion had been approved by June 2021. The budget \nallocation for the Small Enterprise Refinance Scheme  was increased to Tk15 billion (from \nTk8.5 billion) to allow the refinancing of loans to women entrepreneurs at a concessional interest \nrate of 7%.27 To provide comfort to commercial banks in providing loans under the stimulus \npackage to CMSMEs that do not have sufficient collateral, Bangladesh Bank implemented a \npartial credit guarantee scheme (of which Tk8.9 billion was utilized by July 2021), with 5% \nearmarked for women. To encourage entrepreneurs to capture new business opportunities and \nsupport startup CMSMEs, Bangladesh Bank in May 2021 also began implementing a special \nrefinancing scheme with relaxed collateral requirements and a 10% earmark for women. All \nsubprogram 1 actions were fully implemented. \n25.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  establish  a  more  conducive  policy  and \nregulatory environment and introduce innovative financing modalities to overcome CMSMEs' \ncollateral issue and enhance financial intermediation. The proposed measures include (i) adopting \nan alternative credit scoring model by using digital transaction data, (ii) mainstreaming cluster and \nvalue chain financing, and (iii) promoting bank lending based on nontraditional collateral such as \ntrade receivables and warehouse receipts.28 The government will submit to the cabinet for \nenactment a bill to enable the acceptance and use of movable assets as collateral, establish a \nregulatory process for recovery, and facilitate the establishment of a collateral registry. \n26.  ADB\u2019s experience and value addition. The program formulation coincided with the \nfinalization of Bangladesh\u2019s Eighth Five Year Plan; the preparation of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2021\u20132025, which supports ADB\u2019s long-term engagement in the  country\u2019s reform \nagenda; and the country assistance program evaluation, 2021. The PBL follows on from the \nintensive policy dialogue initiated while processing the countercyclical support facility (pandemic \nresponse option) in 2020. ADB will draw on its long-term experience from its diverse operations \nin Bangladesh to implement the PBL. ADB\u2019s value addition includes identifying and prioritizing \npolicy actions for DRM, expenditure management, and PFM reform; and promoting a favorable \nenvironment for access to credit for CMSMEs. Major policies for strengthening DRM include the \nexpansion of the taxpayer base, withdrawal of unproductive income tax exemptions, submission \nof a new income tax code to the cabinet, and digitalization of tax payments and tax returns. Policy \nactions to improve expenditure management include the merger of ADP and nondevelopment \nbudgets, introduction of PIM tools to improve projects' quality at entry, and reinforcement of \nelectronic contract management. An update of the PEFA assessment and PFM action plan will \nhelp the government prioritize its medium-term PFM reforms. To strengthen credit flows to \nCMSMEs, policies for cluster and value chain financing, and adoption of alternative credit scoring \nmodels for providing digital credit will be introduced. Through the attached TA, ADB will support \nthe government in implementing subprogram 2 policy actions and the post-program partnership \n \n27 This is a revolving refinancing scheme, implemented since 2004. Participating financial intermediaries can utilize it \nfor onlending. The disbursement during FY2021 was Tk5.5 billion. \n28 The digital credit scheme will start in December 2022, the cluster financing scheme in September 2022, and value \nchain financing in June 2023. \n ", "9 \nframework (PPPF). Important lessons from the Good Governance Program and the Strengthening \nGovernance Management Project were considered in the program design.29 \n27.  This program builds on the interventions under the COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure Support Program30 to provide financial support on concessional terms to the worst-\nhit industries and thereby protect employment and keep critical sectors and their business \ninfrastructure ready for reactivation once the economy returns to the growth path after the \npandemic. The design of the program was informed by the recent findings of a TA project \nimplemented by ADB31 i.e., that ADB should consider measures to boost credit quality and \nencourage the financial system to extend credit to CMSMEs, particularly startups and CMSMEs \nlocated in different clusters during the pandemic, to ease their financial conditions and enable \nbusiness continuity. ADB will also use its experience from implementing the Third Capital Market \nDevelopment Program, which supported the development of sukuk investment rules to encourage \nthe issuance of sharia-compliant securities by the private sector in the capital markets, and \nremoved tax distortions to promote venture capital activities.32  \n28.  By creating an enabling environment for better credit flows to CMSMEs, this PBL will \ncomplement ADB\u2019s ongoing and proposed loan and TA projects to address more directly the \nneeds of different types of CMSMEs through different delivery channels.33 For cottage and micro \nenterprises, the Microenterprise Development Project promoted innovative financial solutions and \ncreated a better enabling environment by (i) piloting the use of mobile financial services by rural \nmicroenterprises, (ii) developing microenterprise clusters, (iii) facilitating links for the products of \nmicroentrepreneurs  to  e-commerce  platforms,  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  governance  and \ncapacity of MFIs through gender-inclusive microenterprise development training delivered by the \nPalli Karma Sahayak Foundation. The Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development \nProject loan and TA supported access to finance for CMSMEs located outside the metropolitan \nareas, and strengthened the capacity of entrepreneurs to access bank financing by establishing \ntwo business incubation centers. The two interventions also included training and workshops to \nstrengthen the managerial and technical capacity of SME support institutions (Bangladesh Bank, \nSME Foundation, and the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation) as well as \nparticipating financial intermediaries for providing cluster financing and financial services to SMEs, \nincluding those led by women. \n29.  Sustainability. The sustainability of the reforms is anchored on the government\u2019s strong \nownership of the program. The PPPF, to be implemented with TA support, is designed to ensure \ntheir  continuity,  identify  follow-on  reforms,  and  design  future  programs  to  realize  them. \nEngagement through the MTRS and coordination with other development partners will allow ADB \nto identify further areas of PFM reforms and continuously support the government\u2019s DRM efforts. \nUnder reform area 1, the PPPF serves to (i) develop a program for the issuance of sharia-\n \n29 ADB. 2020.

ADB  and  the \ngovernment will also engage in a dialogue on development of the MTRS and updating the SOE \nreform strategy. Under reform area 2, the PPPF will assist the government, Bangladesh Bank, \nand the SME Foundation in (i) evaluating the economic and social impacts of the refinancing and \ncredit guarantee schemes; (ii) identifying new measures to expand digital credit, and cluster and \nvalue chain financing; and (iii) defining the necessary policy and institutional reforms to remove \nthe remaining binding constraints to the development of CMSMEs, for which further investment \nprojects will also be considered. \n30.  Development coordination. The proposed PBL complements the support for PFM and \nCMSMEs from other development partners in Bangladesh. ADB held consultations through the \nLocal Consultative Group, an established forum of all development partners. ADB and the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) will closely collaborate on monitoring the direction of the \ncountry\u2019s overall macroeconomic developments. While preparing the PBL, the proposed reforms \nwere discussed with the IMF prior to the issuance of the IMF assessment letter. The reforms \nunder the PBL are fully consistent with the reforms that the IMF emphasized in the past. The \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Strengthening  PFM  Program  to  Enable  Service  Delivery  Project  assists  the \ngovernment in implementing 8 of the 14 components of the PFM Reform Action Plan, 2018\u20132023. \nADB's  PBL  supports those  components  (DRM  and  expenditure management)  that  are  not \nincluded in the World Bank program. ADB and the World Bank will collaborate to update the PEFA \nassessment and the PFM reform action plan. The World Bank also supports reforms to the \ngovernment's procurement system, and ADB's PBL will complement these efforts by helping the \ngovernment secure cabinet approval for the establishment of an autonomous public procurement \nauthority, implement electronic contract management, and link the iBAS++ and e-GP systems. \nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) developed the PIM tools and piloted them in \ntwo ministries. ADB's PBL will support the rollout of the tools across the entire government, and \nthe attached TA will help build the PIM capacity of staff and develop a cost\u2013benefit analysis tool. \n31.  The policy actions under the PBL will complement the implementation of many ongoing \nfinancial intermediation projects of other development partners for CMSMEs.34 These include (i) \ndirect financing support to CMSMEs from JICA and the World Bank, (ii) the Bangladesh COVID-\n19 Emergency and Crisis Response Facility of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to \nreduce the liquidity constraints of CMSMEs brought on by the pandemic, (iii) the World Bank\u2019s \nSustainable Enterprise Project to increase the uptake of environmentally sustainable practices by \ntargeted microenterprises, and (iv) the facilitation of business support and economic inclusion of \nSMEs through the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. The United Nations Capital \nDevelopment Fund supports digital financial services and access to finance of micro merchants. \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n32.  The overarching objective of the program is to facilitate a rapid recovery from COVID-19 \npandemic and generate employment and income by supporting economic activities, particularly \nfor the poor and vulnerable. The program\u2019s expected outcome will be that efficiency in public \n \n34 ADB met with the implementation teams from the World Bank; JICA; the European Union; and the United Kingdom's \nForeign, Commonwealth & Development Office.

A \nsuccessful outcome will bring in private investment and help the economy return to the pre-\npandemic trajectory of higher growth. Broader access to credit for CMSMEs and their resulting \ngrowth will create widespread employment opportunities, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. \nThe newly employed or reemployed workers will in turn strengthen demand and reinforce the \neconomic recovery. \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n33.  The fiscal deficit of the government is expected to overshoot the long-term target of 5.0% \nof the GDP at least until FY2023, owing to low DRM but higher expenditures on COVID-19 relief \nand recovery measures. This indicates significant short-term financing needs to fund development \nexpenditures, and the deficit is taken as a proxy for aggregate development financing needs.35 \nThe government prioritized securing external funds on concessional terms. It sought budgetary \nsupport from ADB and other development partners to fund the near-term financing needs.36 The \nfiscal deficit is estimated at $23.9 billion for FY2022, and $26.5 billion for FY2023. The projected \nexternal borrowing is $8.8 billion in FY2022, and $11.7 billion in FY2023, with the balance being \nfunded through domestic sources. ADB will provide budget support in the form of a PBL of $500 \nmillion from its ordinary capital resources, under a programmatic approach with two subprograms. \nSubprogram 1 ($250 million) will finance 1.04% of the estimated FY2022 fiscal deficit, and \nsubprogram 2 ($250 million) will finance 0.94% of the estimated FY2023 fiscal deficit. Cofinancing \n(not administered by ADB) for subprogram 1 includes: AIIB ($250 million), the Export-Import Bank \nof Korea ($100 million), and the OPEC Fund for International Development ($100 million).  \n34.  The government requested a regular loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n35.  The implementation periods are April 2020\u2013September 2021 for subprogram 1  and \nOctober 2021\u2013June 2023 for subprogram 2. The loan closing dates will be 31 December 2021 for \n \n35 In its May 2020 debt sustainability assessment, the IMF assessed Bangladesh to be at a low risk of debt distress. \nIMF. 2020. Rapid Credit Facility and the Rapid Financing Instrument. Washington, DC. Bangladesh has not opted \nfor debt relief under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative of the Group of Twenty (G-20). Given its relatively low \nexternal debt stock, Bangladesh has sufficient headroom to increase external borrowing. The IMF assessed that the \nstimulus package, coupled with the projected expansion of the fiscal deficit to 6% in FY2021, is appropriate given \nthe need to cushion the impact of the pandemic. \n36 In 2020, ADB approved the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program for $500 million, \ncofinanced by AIIB for $250 million, the Japan International Cooperation Agency for \u00a535 billion, and the OPEC Fund \nfor International Development for $70 million; and the COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project for \n$100 million.

The Ministry of Finance, acting through \nthe Finance Division, is the executing agency for the program, and a steering committee was set \nup for overall program supervision. The committee, chaired by the secretary or senior secretary \nof the Finance Division, comprises the program director (a senior official from the Finance \nDivision) and representatives from the implementing agencies, i.e., the Financial Institutions \nDivision, Bangladesh Bank, the NBR, the Planning Commission\u2019s Programming Division, and the \nCPTU. The steering committee will meet at least semi-annually. ADB will monitor the program's \nimplementation through quarterly progress reports and regular missions. Procurement, advance \ncontracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The  proceeds  of  the  PBL  will  be \nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nThe proceeds of subprogram 1 will be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n36.  The attached TA will support the program's implementation and the achievement of the \nproposed policy actions under subprogram 2. It will be implemented from October 2021 to June \n2024.37 ADB will administer the TA as the executing agency. The implementing agencies will be \nthe  Finance  Division,  the  NBR,  the  Planning  Commission\u2019s  Programming  Division,  and \nBangladesh Bank. The TA outputs are: (i) capacity of the executing and implementing agencies \nstrengthened and implementation of subprogram 2 supported; (ii) guideline for banks and financial \ninstitutions on the provision of value chain financing to CMSMEs developed, and implementation \nof the PPPF supported; and (iii) PEFA conducted and PFM reform action plan updated.38 A \nconsulting firm will be recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, to provide 27.5 person-months of consulting services, including 5.5 \nperson-months international; and 2 individual international consultants will also be recruited (6 \nperson-months). \n \n37.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, workshop venues, other logistical support, and other in-\nkind contributions. The TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nassociated project administration instructions and/or technical assistance staff instructions. \n \nIV.

Economic. Stronger PFM and more efficiency in the use of available resources will be \nessential for a sustainable economic recovery from COVID-19, inclusive and sustained growth, \nand employment creation.41 The fiscal space created under the program will allow the government \nto prioritize expenditures, upscale productive investments, and boost public expenditure for social \nand economic infrastructure. A sound PFM system and a better fiscal position will contribute to \nthe economy\u2019s resilience and its ability to absorb external shocks and maintain macroeconomic \nstability. Enhancing access to credit for CMSMEs is critical to protect this important segment of \nthe economy, support inclusive growth, and absorb the demographic dividend. The transmission \nchannels include improved tax policy leading to enhanced taxpayer coverage and higher resource \nmobilization, increased tax administration efficiency through digitalization, improved allocative \nefficiency of public resources, and more sustainable flow of credit to CMSMEs. The reforms will \nplace Bangladesh firmly on the path to achieve its medium-term objectives of becoming an upper \nmiddle-income country by 2031. \n40.  Gender. The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The COVID-19 \npandemic  impaired  the  livelihoods  of  people  in  different  ways.  Women  entrepreneurs  and \nvulnerable women (especially those in informal employment) were affected disproportionately \nbecause they lost income and jobs.42 The current banking system's exposure to women borrowers \nis low at 4%.43 The program will widen access to finance for women entrepreneurs,44 particularly \nthose running CMSMEs, by introducing or modifying refinancing programs and credit guarantee \nschemes with an earmarked portion for women entrepreneurs (para. 24).
