INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to address the needs of the \nmember states and the secretariat of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and \nEconomic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) to advance regional cooperation and integration (RCI) among \nmember states in select thematic areas.1 The TA will produce innovative and operationally \nrelevant knowledge solutions to critical development issues and develop capacity to strengthen \ncooperation to collectively address the challenges facing the region. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Regional Cooperation and Integration Operational Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020 in three outcome-focused operational directions: connectivity, competitiveness, and regional \ncommon goods.2 The TA is also fully aligned with the Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), which identifies fostering RCI through enhanced connectivity and competitiveness, \namong others, as an operational priority.3The TA is also generally aligned with the country \n \nprograms as RCI is an important undertaking in all seven BIMSTEC member states.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  BIMSTEC is a regional organization comprising seven member states lying in the littoral \nand adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in \nSouth Asia; and Myanmar and Thailand in Southeast Asia. The organization began in 1997 \nthrough the Bangkok Declaration with the objective of harnessing shared and accelerated growth \nthrough  cooperation  in  14  areas  of  common  interests  including  transport,  energy,  trade, \ntechnology, tourism, agriculture, public health, environment, and climate change. The regional \ngroup bridges South Asia and Southeast Asia and reinforces relations among these countries.  \n \n4.  The Bay of Bengal region, home to about 1.5 billion people or about 22% of the world\u2019s \npopulation, had a combined gross domestic product of $3.4 trillion in 2017. Since 2015, BIMSTEC \nmember states have sustained an average 6.5% economic growth trajectory by using regional \nresources and geographical advantages. However, more than 2 decades since its establishment, \nBIMSTEC still has considerable untapped RCI potential, especially in connectivity, trade, and \ntourism. Constraints include insufficient financial resources for transport connectivity and other \nRCI initiatives, absence of appropriate policies and strategies in key RCI areas, and limited human \nresources  and  capacity  of  the  BIMSTEC  secretariat  and  member  states  in  planning  and \nimplementing RCI initiatives. These have led to higher cost of intraregional trade, inefficient cross-\nborder movement of goods and people, and lower-than-expected tourist arrivals. \n \n5.  The need to accelerate trade facilitation efforts. Trade\u2014one of the initial six sectors of \nBIMSTEC cooperation at its inception in 1997\u2014plays an increasingly important role in national \nand global economic growth. The Framework Agreement on the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area (FTA), \nwhich was signed and came into force in 2004, outlined steps to address tariff and nontariff \nbarriers and achieve the BIMSTEC FTA. The BIMSTEC Trade Negotiating Committee held 20 \nrounds of negotiations for finalizing agreements and protocols that would form integral parts of \nthe BIMSTEC FTA, including agreements on trade in goods, trade in services, rules of origin, \ntrade facilitation, and protocol to amend the Framework Agreement. BIMSTEC leaders directed \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 June 2019. \n2 ADB. 2016.

Manila.   \n \n ", "2 \nthe BIMSTEC Trade and Economic Ministerial Meeting and its subsidiary bodies to expedite the \nfinalization of all related agreements of the BIMSTEC FTA, particularly taking concrete steps to \nenhance trade facilitation.4 Tariffs have generally been declining in most favored nation and free \ntrade agreement rates in Asia, but nontariff barriers continue to impede smooth trade transactions. \nIt is thus expected that gains from trade facilitation may surpass the benefits from further tariff \nreduction.  \n \n6.  Untapped regional tourism potential. Tourism, one of the initial six sectors of BIMSTEC \ncooperation, has a high multiplier effect and is a catalyst for economic growth and employment \ngeneration. BIMSTEC adopted the Plan of Action for Tourism Development and Promotion in \n2005 and established the BIMSTEC Tourism Information Center and BIMSTEC Tourism Fund to \nfacilitate joint tourism activities among the member states. BIMSTEC also created a network of \ntour operators among the member states. However, because of various constraints including \ninsufficient investment in tourism infrastructure and the lack of a common BIMSTEC tourism \nmarketing strategy, tourist arrivals are below expectations, and huge tourism potential remains \nuntapped. Given the civilizational, historical, and cultural linkages among the member states, and \nthe rich potential to develop tourism in the region, BIMSTEC leaders tasked relevant authorities \nto devise strategies and take concrete steps to promote tourism that include specialized tourist \ncircuits and ecotourism, particularly a Buddhist tourist circuit, a temple tourist circuit, and an \nancient cities trail (footnote 4). \n \n7.  Inadequate human resources and capacity. The BIMSTEC secretariat was established \nin Dhaka, Bangladesh in September 2014 to serve the BIMSTEC member states. Currently, the \nsecretariat has 25 full-time staff to coordinate, monitor, and facilitate BIMSTEC activities and \nprograms on 14 priority sectors. Given the amount and challenges of work, the existing human \nresources and capacity of the BIMSTEC secretariat remain inadequate and need to be further \naugmented to enable it to fulfill its responsibilities effectively and efficiently. The BIMSTEC \nmember states\u2019 agencies also need enhanced capacity to plan and implement RCI initiatives, in \nview of changing priorities and emerging challenges in the region. \n \n8.  ADB assistance on transport connectivity. ADB assisted the BIMSTEC secretariat and \nmember states through two previous TA projects to develop policies and programs to address \nregional transport connectivity issues, a fundamental requirement in any RCI process.5 ADB \ncarried out the BIMSTEC Transport Infrastructure and Logistics Study (BTILS)  and the Updating \nand  Enhancement  of  the  BTILS,  and  prepared  the  BIMSTEC  Master  Plan  for  Transport \nConnectivity, which provided policies, strategies, and projects for regional transport connectivity \nbetween South Asia and Southeast Asia.6 The 12th BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting in 2009 and \nthe 15th BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting in 2017 endorsed the BTILS and the Updating and \nEnhancement of the BTILS. ADB has completed the master plan, which is expected to be \nendorsed for implementation by the BIMSTEC member states in 2019.  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s  work  helped  improve  infrastructure  connectivity  and  trade  facilitation  in  the \nBIMSTEC region, and BIMSTEC leaders expressed great appreciation in the fourth BIMSTEC \n                                                \n4  Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. 2018.

Future cooperation will focus on implementing the policies, \nstrategies, and projects recommended by the BTILS, the Updating and Enhancement of the \nBTILS, and the master plan. Some transport connectivity projects identified in the master plan do \nnot yet have funding sources, further delaying addressing connectivity roadblocks in the region. \nIn addition, given the changing economic, social, environment, and political landscape in the \nregion, a forward-looking approach and long-term plan is crucial to identify opportunities and \nchallenges for better connectivity in the region. Mobilizing adequate financial resources is an \nurgent and important task.   \n \n10.  Remaining challenges and opportunities. Despite the efforts and achievements made \nby the member states and secretariat of BIMSTEC, ADB, and other development partners, \nconsiderable challenges persist, and, as a consequence, opportunities in trade facilitation, tourism \npromotion, capacity development, and transport connectivity in the BIMSTEC region remain \nuntapped. More work needs to be done to further RCI initiatives in the region. The BIMSTEC \nsecretariat wrote to the ADB President in October 2018 to pursue expanding cooperation between \nthe two organizations, and requested ADB\u2019s further assistance to carry out analytical studies and \nprovide strategies or policy recommendations on transport connectivity financing, trade facilitation, \nand tourism promotion.  \n \n11.  The TA will respond to the request, and further support the capacity building of the \nBIMSTEC secretariat and member states on RCI planning and implementation. ADB\u2019s continued \nassistance will help BIMSTEC maximize the use of the region\u2019s resources and geographical \nadvantages to harness shared and accelerated growth through mutual cooperation. The TA \nconsidered and incorporated lessons learned from previous TA projects in designing this TA, \nincluding allowing for more time for multicountry and multiagency consultations, and enhancing \nthe capacity of the BIMSTEC secretariat and the government agencies of member states. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: regional cooperation and integration among \nmember states of BIMSTEC strengthened.7 The TA will have the following outcome: policies for \nimproving  RCI  in  transport  connectivity  financing,  trade  facilitation,  and  tourism  promotion \nenhanced.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Analytical studies on select thematic areas produced. The TA will examine \nchallenges and opportunities facing the BIMSTEC region on transport connectivity financing, \ntrade facilitation, and tourism promotion. The study on transport connectivity financing will (i) \nanalyze possible financing options, including domestic and global capital markets, and (ii) suggest \nfeasible financing models involving governments, private entities, public\u2013private partnerships, \nand multilateral and bilateral financing. The study on trade facilitation will assess key challenges \nand recommend needed policy reforms to address nontariff trade barriers. The study on tourism \npromotion will identify tourism potentials in the region and propose an enabling environment for \ntourism to prosper. The TA may also conduct analytical studies on other thematic areas upon the \nrequest of BIMSTEC secretariat and its member states.   \n                                                \n7  Defined by the project. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n14.  Output 2: Capacity development interventions for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for \nMulti-Sectoral  Technical  and  Economic  Cooperation  secretariat  and  member  states \nimplemented. Activities will include consulting with the BIMSTEC secretariat and member states \non the capacity development programs they would need to successfully implement RCI initiatives. \nSuch programs may include training activities on project management including development, \nimplementation, and monitoring; financial management and economic analysis of projects; and \ntechnical report writing. The TA will also conduct other programs including  regional policy \nmeetings, conferences, workshops, and other knowledge-sharing and awareness-raising events \nin partnership with think tanks, centers of excellence, development partners, and secretariats of \nother subregional programs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUnited Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.9 The key expenditure \nitems are in Appendix 2.  \n \n16.  The United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity will finance the TA \nactivities and outputs, including operational expenses in the form of consulting services, training \nevents, conferences, workshops, and other TA-related activities. The TA will not use the funds for \ncivil works, procurement of large-scale equipment, and permanent staffing costs.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division of the South Asia Department, in close consultation with the BIMSTEC \nsecretariat and member states, and with Southeast Asia Department. ADB will engage individual \nconsultants, procure goods, and organize workshops for the implementation of TA activities.
