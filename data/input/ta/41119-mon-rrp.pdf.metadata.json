An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nAssessment  undertaken. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  build  on  previous  health  sector  development \ninitiatives to continue reform of the Mongolian health sector regarding \nprimary health care (PHC). The Project consists of four components: \n(i) strengthened health services, (ii) improved health care financing \nand health insurance, (iii) improved human resources development, \nand (iv) sector capacity development and management.   \n \nComponent 1 will strengthen health services through improving family \ngroup practices (FGPs), soum health centers, and aimag (province) \ngeneral  hospitals  through  infrastructure  upgrades,  equipment,  and \ntraining. The Project will also strengthen aimag general and duureg \n(Ulaanbaatar City district) hospitals in Ulaanbaatar in their supportive \nroles to PHC. Component 2 will improve health financing policies, \nincrease health insurance coverage and effectiveness, and improve \nhospital financial management capacity. Component 3 will strengthen \nhuman  resource  planning  and  processes  and  develop  incentive \nsystems to increase key health staff in areas of critical shortage. \nComponent 4 will improve capacity and governance in the health \nsector  through  increased  capabilities  in  planning,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and policy development with a sector-wide focus. \n \nComponent 1 will focus on five aimags (Arkhangai, Dundogov, Gobi \nAltai,  Sukhbaatar,  and  Tuv)  that  have  been  selected  based  on \npoverty levels, health status, and levels of development investment, \nas  well  as  two  duuregs  of  Ulaanbaatar  (Chingeltei  and \nSonginokhairkan)  having  significant  populations  of  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  people  living  in  ger  (traditional  tent)  areas. \nComponents 2, 3, and 4 will focus on policy change and reform of the \nhealth  sector  system  nationwide,  including  health  financing  and \ninsurance,  human  resources  development,  and  regulation  and \ngovernance. Assistance from Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction is \nbeing sought to improve access to health services for disadvantaged \ngroups in Ulaanbaatar.  \n \nRationale  Policy  reform  in  Mongolia  in  expanding  and  improving  PHC, \nimproving financial expenditure for increased system efficiency, and \nimproving human resources (HR) capacity requires continued support \nand  attention  to  maintain  momentum.  The  hospital-focused  and \ninefficient  health  system  inherited  from  Soviet  times  needs  to  be ", "ii   \nremodeled.  Long-term  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) has been successful in maintaining the momentum, despite \norganizational, staff, and political changes.  \n \nDespite significant progress, further support is required to build upon \nand  sustain  reforms.  There  is  wide  disparity  in  access  to  health \nservices, quality of services, and health outcomes between urban and \nrural  areas  in  Mongolia.  There  is  a  significant  need  for  further \nupgrading  of  infrastructure  to  improve  rural  health  services,  and \nparticularly  in  aimags  which  have  so  far  received  little  or  no \ninvestment. \n \nThe Project will build on the policy platform established by previous \nprojects  and  continue  the  reform  agenda  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan (HSMP) and in tandem with \nrecently  established  intersectoral  coordinating  mechanisms.  These \nnew initiatives indicate renewed commitment in Mongolia and greater \nlikelihood of successful project achievements.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is improved health status and quality of life \nfor the population of Mongolia. The outcome of the Project is PHC \nservices that are more effective and improved financial protection \nthrough health insurance. \n   \nProject Investment  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $17.6 million equivalent, \nPlan  including physical and price contingencies, taxes, and duties.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested grant financing of $14.0 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, representing 80% of the Project\u2019s \ntotal  cost. The  remaining  $3.6  million  equivalent,  or  20%,  will  be \nprovided by the Government. \n \nSource  Total  % \n($ million) \nAsian Development Bank   14.0  80 \nGovernment   3.6  20 \n  Total  17.6  100 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nGrant Amount  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $14  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources. The grant will be subject to conditions set forth in the grant \nagreement.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Health (MOH)  \n \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC) has been established to provide \nArrangements  overall guidance. It is chaired by the State Secretary of MOH and \ncomposed of senior officials from MOH, Ministry of Social Welfare \nand Labor, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and other key agencies, as ", "  iii\nwell as private sector representatives. The five project aimags will \nestablish  aimag  supervisory  groups,  each  chaired  by  the  aimag \ngovernor\u2019s  office  and  composed  of  representatives  of  the  health \ndepartment, aimag general hospitals, and soum health centers. The \ntwo Project duuregs will establish duureg supervisory groups, chaired \nby the governor\u2019s office and composed of the district health alliance, \ndistrict  general  hospital,  Ulaanbaatar  city  health  department  and \nFGPs. The PSC and supervisory groups in project areas will meet \nquarterly  and  be  responsible  for  providing  strategic  orientation, \napproving the annual budget and activity plan, and reviewing and \nadvising on implementation progress.  \n \nA project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up in MOH and be \nresponsible for project coordination and day-to-day implementation of \nproject  activities  including  procurement,  disbursement,  review  and \nmonitoring, and reporting on progress. The PIU will consult closely \nwith relevant health facilities, agencies, and international partners. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  ADB-financed  goods,  services  and  works  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  international  competitive \nbidding, national competitive bidding, and shopping procedures. Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications to the recipient procurement \nprocedures will be documented in the Procurement Plan.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require a total of 57 person-months of international \n  and  312  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  financed \nunder the ADB grant. The international and national consultants will \nhave expertise in (i) PHC services, (ii) public health, (iii) civil works, \n(iv)  medical  equipment,  (v)  information  and  communication \ntechnology  network  development,  (vi)  health  care  financing  and \nhealth insurance, (vii) HR management and development, (viii) health \nplanning, (ix) private health services planning and provision, and (x) \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Other  national  consultants  will  have \nexpertise in (i) legal issues on the legal, tax, business, and social \nstatus of FGPs; (ii) web design; and (iii) gender and development. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). Selected international and national consultants will be \ncontracted  individually.  The  remaining  international  and  national \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  contracted  through  firms,  using \nADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedure (quality-cost ratio \nof 80:20), among short-listed international consulting firms. \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project\u2019s  targeted  outcome  is  effective  PHC  and  improved \nBeneficiaries  financial  protection  through  health  insurance,  which  will  positively \n  impact on Mongolians\u2019 health status and quality of life, and especially \nin rural settings and in poor areas of Ulaanbaatar under the Project. \nStrengthening the FGP model will increase urban populations\u2019 access \nto better quality PHC services, including treatment, prevention, and \nhealth education. FGPs specifically benefit the poor, as more than \n60% of clients are below the poverty threshold and include women, \nyoung children, and the elderly. By improving rural health services \n ", "iv   \nthrough infrastructure development, equipment, enhancing staff skills, \nand increasing the number of key health professionals, the Project \nwill benefit rural populations, for which health outcomes and access \nare poorer than for urban Mongolians. The Project will directly benefit \nalmost  700,000  people  in  the  five  aimags  and  two  duuregs  of \nUlaanbaatar (26.8% of the total Mongolian population). \n \nPolicy  measures  (health  financing  and  insurance),  capacity \ndevelopment, and HR development under the Project will benefit the \nentire population through nationwide components aimed at improving \nhealth system effectiveness. The Project will impact on population \nhealth and Millennium Development Goals and targets by improving \naccess; increasing service quality; facilitating financial protection for \nhealth  care;  increasing  professional  capacity  development,  policy, \nplanning,  and  implementation  capability;  and  establishing  system \nregulation. The Project yields an economic internal rate of return of \n22.8% and a net present value of MNT11.3  billion (discount rate \n12%). \n   \nRisks and Mitigation  Three  potential  risks  have  been  identified.  The  first  is  reduced \nMeasures  government support and commitment to health sector development \n  and  reform.  The  Project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through  continuing \npolicy dialogue with the Government and donor community in the \ncontext of the HSMP. By building on the established policy platform \nand continuing the reform agenda, the risk of diminishing government \nor agency commitment will be managed. Project involvement in such \nintersectoral  processes  as  the  joint  annual  reviews  of  HSMP \nimplementation, National Health Development Strategy and National \nPolicy Development initiatives under the HSMP, and the High Level \nHR Coordinating Committee to strengthen national HR policy and \nstrategy will assist in maintaining government support and attention. \n \nThe second risk area is related to slow progress or resistance to \nreforms due to two factors: (i) high turnover of officials and senior \ntechnical  staff  in  key  agencies  as  a  result  of  frequent  leadership \nchanges;  and  (ii)  resistance  of  key  staff  groups  (e.g.,  hospital \nspecialists), agencies (e.g., State Social Insurance General Office), \nsectors (e.g., the private hospitals), and the community to change and \nreform.  The  first  will  be  addressed  through  close  monitoring  and \ndialogue  with  MOH  and  support  to  the  HSMP  Implementation \nCoordination Committee. The second will be mitigated through project \ninformation campaigns, awareness raising, and training. \n \nA third risk is MOF resistance to single purchasing and pooling of \nfunds as a major element of financing reform. To mitigate this risk, the \nProject will promote pooling and single purchasing as measures that \nwill reduce transaction costs, conform to the Public Sector Finance \nManagement Law, and be established within the currently available \nhuman and institutional capacity. \n ", "96o  00'E 111 o 00'E\nMONGOLIA\nR U S S I A N     F E D E R A T I O N\nTHIRD HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nHanh\n50 o 00'N 50 o 00'N\nUlaangom Hatgal\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Nogoonnuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSukhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Dzavhan Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD\nHavirga\nZAVHAN ZhargalantBulgan ORHONSumber\nHovd ARHANGAY HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Tsahir BattseHnisgheilg Ondor Atar ULAANBAATARBaganuur Batnorov\nDariv Uliastay TUV Nalaih Tamsagbulag\nHOVD Tsetserleg Zuunmod Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad\nTayshir Maant\nYarantay Harhorin GOVISUMBER\nAltay Baruun-Urt\nAltay Bayanhongor Choyr\nArvayheer Erdenetsagaan\nTogrog Buutsagaan Mandalgovi Bichigt\nGOVI-ALTAY Nariynteel SUHBAATAR\nChandman Bayandelger\nOVORHANGAY DUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nTsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOVI\nZamyn-Uud\nDalanzadgad\nSevrey Project Duureg (Chingeltei, Songinokhairkan)\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo Project Aimag 42 o 00'N\nNational Capital\nGashuun Suhayt\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nN\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC Main Road\nOF  CHINA  Provincial Road\nRailway\n0 50 100150200250\nRiver\nKilometers Provincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n07 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n-1\n6\n65 R 96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nM", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Mongolia for the Third Health Sector Development Project. \n \n2.  In 2006, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to cooperate \nwith the Ministry of Health (MOH) and prepare the Third Health Sector Development Project, \nbuilding on and furthering the results of the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) that \nwas  successfully  completed  in  2003  and  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project \n(SHSDP),  which  is  ongoing  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  2008.1 The  Government \nconsiders improving the quality of the health care system, ensuring access to and quality of \nprimary  health  care  (PHC),  and  reforming  health  care  financing  to  be  key  instruments  to \nalleviate  poverty,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and  reduce  disparities  in  the  development \nprocess,  particularly  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy, and it is included in the ADB\u2019s Mongolia Country Strategy \nProgram and Update (2007\u20132009). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  In  the  early  1990s,  Mongolia  inherited  a  Soviet-style  health  system  with  a  large, \ninefficient  hospital  sector  providing  generally  outmoded  and  low  quality  care  and  further \ncharacterized  by  poorly  developed  PHC,  financing  systems,  human  resources  (HR)  and \nplanning, and regulatory processes. Together, these factors contributed to the health system\u2019s \nrequiring overall reform and realignment. \n \n4.  ADB has cooperated closely with the Government to identify and implement reform \npriorities, which are (i) to transform the hospital-dominated system towards PHC; (ii) develop the \ncapacity to plan, finance, manage, and monitor the health system; and (iii) upgrade health \nservice infrastructure. In 1997, under HSDP, ADB provided initial support for critical changes in \nthe Mongolian health care system. Key initiatives supported by HSDP include developing the \nfamily group practice (FGP) system (teams of family doctors and nurses providing treatment \nand prevention services to the population) as a means of transforming the health system \ntowards  PHC,  introducing  regulatory  and  monitoring  systems  through  licensing  and \naccreditation, HR policy development (through incentive schemes and career support to assist \nin health personnel transfer and redeployment), management training, and emphasizing quality \nimprovement by establishing systematic improvement structures in the health sector.  \n \n5.  Since 2004, ADB support through SHSDP has focused on improving access to quality \nhealth services in rural areas (through infrastructure improvements and providing equipment) \nand  extending  reforms  initiated  under  HSDP.  Policy  reforms  under  SHSDP  include \nconsolidation  of  HR  reforms  through  establishing  career  development  schemes  and \ninstitutionalizing  incentive  mechanisms  for  rural  health  workers,  piloting  such  new  funding \nmodels as output based budgeting and case mix funding to increase efficiency of the sector, \nand  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  MOH  to  undertake  sector  reforms  and  improve  the \nprovision of more effective health services at decentralized levels.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

As a result of this cooperation, there has been significant progress in a number of areas. \nThis is evidenced by improved health outcomes with continuing decreases in important sector \nindicators, including the infant mortality and maternal mortality rates. However, major reform \ninitiatives have yet to be fully implemented and to achieve sustainable impact. The FGP system, \nestablished  nationwide  in  2002,  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  reform  process  and  still  needs \nconsolidation and further investment, the hospital sector is still excessive and attracts the bulk of \nhealth  expenditure,  health  financing  mechanisms  do  not  sufficiently  target  efficiency,  HR \ncapacity and policies are still weak, and lack of governance and regulatory capacity has resulted \nin unrestricted private sector growth and ineffective monitoring systems. An overview of the \nMongolian health sector and performance issues is in Appendix 2. An assessment of the FGP \nsystem in Mongolia is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n7.  The Mongolian health care system is in a critical phase. In many areas, implementation \nof reforms has been incomplete, resulting in initially modest results and transformations. Without \nclear strategic and policy directions and further targeted support, many reform initiatives are in \ndanger of drifting. The Government has endorsed a Health Sector Master Plan (HSMP) to bring \ntogether resources, policies, and strategies to guide the reform agenda, and there is recognition \nby international partners of the need to provide continued support to reforms.  \n \n8.  The Government approved the HSMP in April 2005. That plan was developed through a \nconsultative process, and it serves as a comprehensive technical long-term planning document \n(for 2006\u20132015) in line with Mongolia\u2019s desire to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Main strategies of the HSMP include (i) further increasing coverage, access and \nutilization of health services, and especially for disadvantaged groups, through promoting quality \nPHC; (ii) strengthening health human resources skills and management; (iii) strengthening the \nfinancial management system to improve resources use; (iv) improving the health insurance \nsystem; and (v) supporting a sector-wide health care approach to improve coordination of inputs \nand  resources  management.  Donor  support  for  the  Mongolian  health  sector  is  detailed  in \nAppendix 3. A timely opportunity now exists for the Project to consolidate reform initiatives and \nfurther develop and implement strategies to strengthen Mongolia\u2019s health care system. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n9.  The health system continues to face issues of low quality, inefficiency, and insufficient \nprogress on major health areas and service delivery modalities. Key problem areas and the \nchanges required to increase operating efficiency and performance are summarized below. \nAppendix 4 provides detailed analysis of problems, constraints, and improvement opportunities. \n \n10.  Variation in Health Indicators. In important indicator areas, including infant mortality, \nunder 5-mortality, and maternal mortality, Mongolia is making good progress overall (although \nthe maternal mortality rate of 93 per 100,000 live births is still considered relatively high) and is \nlikely to achieve the MDGs and targets for child health, maternal health, and universal access to \nreproductive  health.  Within  the  overall  indicators,  however,  there  are  significant  regional \nvariations, with some aimags (provinces) recording rates 2\u20133 times higher than the national \naverage for maternal mortality. Aimag averages for key indicators are consistently poorer than \nthe Ulaanbaatar city averages, suggesting significant inequity in service provision between \nurban and rural areas. In general, the rural health system has lower quality services, less \nqualified staff, and lower levels of infrastructure and equipment.  \n \n11.  Like  many post-Soviet  systems,  the  adult  mortality  situation  in  Mongolia,  especially \namong males, is deteriorating. This is in part due to poor lifestyle, as alcohol abuse, high \ntobacco consumption, and high-fat diets are leading to significant increases in cardiovascular \ndisease,  diabetes,  and  cancer.  Male  mortality  is  also  significantly  higher  for  injuries  and \n ", "3 \npoisoning, and the incidence of tuberculosis is higher in males compared to females after age \n35. Poverty is a major factor affecting poor health outcomes. Despite recent gains in Mongolia\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP), the proportion of people below the poverty threshold was still \n36% nationwide in 2002.2 The links between pervasive poverty and disease are reflected in the \ncontinuing  rise  in  the  incidence  of  tuberculosis,  which  has  doubled  to  175  per  100,000 \npopulation since 1990. The major causes of death in Mongolia are now cardiovascular disease, \ncancer, injuries, and respiratory disease\u2014all of which are on the rise, and especially in urban \nsedentary populations. Diseases of the respiratory system are the leading cause of population \nmorbidity. \n \n12.  Low Quality of Rural Health Services. The quality of rural health services provided by \nbag feldshers (community nurses) and in soum (administrative unit of the aimag) health centers \n(SHCs) is generally worse than are services provided in urban areas. This reflects isolation and \nremoteness,  scarce  HR  capacity  and  skills  in  the  countryside,  problems  in  attracting  and \nretaining staff, reduced training and continuing education opportunities, and lack of professional \nand clinical support. Infrastructure, equipment, and supplies are generally of a much lower \nstandard in rural areas. The Government and MOH have developed rural health programs to \nupgrade SHCs, establish regional diagnostic and treatment centers in three aimags across \nMongolia,  and  improve  communication  and  access  to  remote  consultations  and  specialist \nsupport.  The  Japan  Fund  for  Information  and  Communications  Technology  grant  project3 \nassociated with SHDSP also focuses on improving technological capacity to link SHCs to aimag \ngeneral  hospitals  (AGHs),  with  an  emphasis  on  maternal  and  child  health  outcomes. \nNevertheless, rural health improvement still lags significantly behind urban health development, \nand Ulaanbaatar still attracts most of development assistance. \n \n13.  Poor Hospital Service Quality. Services provided in aimag, duureg (Ulaanbaatar City \ndistrict), and tertiary hospitals are perceived as low quality by much of the population, evidenced \nby the rising numbers of affluent Mongolians (and the less affluent, who often go into debt) who \nseek  medical  care  abroad.  Many  reasons  underlie  poor  health  care  quality  in  Mongolia, \nincluding  limited  resources  for  staff,  underdeveloped  quality  improvement  systems,  poor \nmonitoring  systems,  lack  of  incentives  to  provide  better  quality  care,  weak  organizational \nprocesses, and under trained staff and managers. A range of financial and nonfinancial options \nare  available  for  long-term  systematic  improvement.  These  include  financing  systems  and \nincentives to improve quality and outcomes, strengthening quality improvement mechanisms in \nhospitals, better use of guidelines, strengthening monitoring, training, and more effective quality \nmonitoring and use of data and indicators for evidence-based policy making. Implementation of \nthese kinds of activities\u2014many of which were proposed under HSDP and SHSDP\u2014has been \nsporadic to date. \n \n14.  Inefficient  Hospital  Sector.  Mongolia  has  too  many  hospitals  (23.4  per  100,000 \npopulation,  compared  with  5.78  per  100,000  for  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States \ncountries),4 and the hospital sector consumes the bulk of the Government\u2019s health spending. \nPublic hospitals and facilities in the capital city, with a population of around 900,000, include 16 \nclinical and tertiary hospitals and centers and some 46 hospitals of various types. There is also \na large and growing private health sector of hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies \nconcentrated in Ulaanbaatar. There has been only limited consolidation of facilities over the past \nfew years. In addition to surplus capacity and staff, other shortcomings include inappropriate \nhospital admissions and clinical practices, an ineffective referral system, ineffective distribution \n                                                 \n2  National Statistical Office (NSO). 2004.

European database. 2005. \n ", "4 \nof  limited  technology,  fragmentation  of  funding  sources  and  administration,  limited  use  of \ninformation,  and  rigid  planning  and  budgeting.  Adverse  payment  incentives  encourage \ninefficient use of in-patient services and hospital stays are unnecessarily long, averaging 9\u201311 \ndays.   \n \n15.  Rationalization. Combining hospitals to create a smaller number of larger and more \nefficient facilities, closing small redundant hospitals, and reducing duplication in services is \nnecessary to release operating savings to the health sector and realign the balance between \nPHC (still underfunded) and secondary and tertiary services. The problem is larger, however, as \nhospitals need to be managed more efficiently and be more responsive to population health \nneeds and morbidity, with beds and services linked to disease patterns and changing clinical \npractice. Hospitals need to adopt more effective clinical and service delivery processes (such as \nday only and ambulatory care), admission policies, and treatment guidelines and pathways. This \nentails a restructuring and optimization of the hospital sector that is focused on a smaller \nnumber  of  better  equipped  and  functioning  hospitals,  based  on  health  planning  need  and \nassessments, and operating under modern management and financing systems and clinical \nprotocols.  These  are  considerable  challenges.  There  is  strong  political,  professional,  and \ncommunity sensitivity around reducing the extent of the hospital sector in Mongolia, and this has \nimpeded efforts by MOH and international partners to accelerate optimization. Nevertheless, \nwith  the  appropriate  emphasis  on  modernizing  and  improving  hospital  services,  and  on \nconsultation and participation with stakeholders, negative perceptions of hospital restructuring \ncan be countered. This requires careful planning and organization and commitment from both \nthe Government and development partners. \n \n16.  Poorly Developed Health Care Financing and Health Insurance. Mongolian public \nhealth care expenditure is relatively low, at around 5% of GDP, but increasing funding and \ninvestment is only a partial answer. Mongolian health financing is inefficient in many ways. \nFinancial arrangements with hospitals are fragmented, funded from the government budget and \nhealth insurance; financing is not linked to performance or efficiency; incentives are perverse, \nencouraging inappropriate admissions and unnecessary time in the hospital; costing data is \nlacking; financial allocations favor larger hospitals over smaller rural facilities; and there is \ndisproportionate  spending  overall  on  hospitals  rather  than  on  public  health  or  preventive \nservices.  \n \n17.  The Government is currently improving health financing strategies, and a number of \ninitiatives are being reviewed with technical assistance support from ADB.5 These include output \nbased  budgeting,  single  purchaser  model,  case  mix  and  per  capita  funding,  and  global \nbudgeting and performance based payment and incentives. Despite relatively low expenditures \non health, the Mongolian health system has the potential to perform much more effectively, with \nimprovements to operating efficiency linked to better financing strategies and targeted funding \nbased on improving performance. \n \n18.  Weak  Human  Resources  Development  (HRD).  The  health  sector  HR  system  is \nmarked  by  oversupply  of  doctors,  low  ratios  of  nurses  to  doctors,  misdistribution  of  key \npersonnel with  critical  shortages in  rural  and  remote  areas,  and  poor  career development \nopportunities. This situation is likely to further reduce quality and performance in the sector. HR \nplanning and policy capacity is weak, and there is little linkage of training and curricula to future \nprofessional requirements.  \n \n19.  A range of HR interventions are needed, including (i) to control future doctor numbers, \n(ii)  incentive  systems  to  encourage  movement  of  key  staff  to  areas  of  need,  (iii)  career \npathways,  and  (iv)  HR  systems  to  promote  training  and  capacity  development.  The \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Support for Health Reform. Manila. \n ", "5 \nestablishment of the intersectoral High Level HR Coordinating Committee to develop integrated \nHR policies and strategies between government agencies and donors is an important first step \nin improving HRD in the health sector, and the potential now exists to address HR on a broader \nsystem basis. ADB is a partner in the High Level HR Coordinating Committee. \n \n20.  Lack  of  Capacity,  Oversight,  and  Regulation.  Many  of  the  problems  still  facing \nMongolian health care are the result of weak implementation of reforms and inadequate policy \ndevelopment. MOH and other agencies have insufficient monitoring and evaluation, regulation, \nand governance capabilities. As a result, overall policy directions are lacking and the regulatory \nenvironment is weak, as evidenced by the uncontrolled growth of the private health sector. \nPrioritization and consistency are also weak and limit the effectiveness of reforms. The FGP \nsystem is a case in point. The model has received insufficient priority and attention, resulting in \nunderfunding and limited progress. More focused implementation and monitoring would have \nobviated many of the problems now facing family doctors.  \n \n21.  Rationale for the Project. HSDP and SHSDP helped implement initial sector reforms, \ndevelop PHC, and improve infrastructure and service delivery. Nevertheless, further assistance \nis needed to consolidate and continue implementation of health reform in line with HSMP. There \nis wide disparity in access to health services, quality of services, and health outcomes between \nurban and rural areas in Mongolia. There is a need for significant upgrading of infrastructure to \nimprove rural health services, particularly in aimags which have so far received little or no \ninvestment. There is also a need to build on the policy reforms advanced under previous health \nsector development initiatives: expanding and improving PHC, improving financial expenditure \nfor  increased  system  efficiency,  expanding  health  insurance  coverage,  and  improving  HR \ncapacity. Policy reform in these areas requires continual support and attention for a number of \nreasons. First, the entrenched structure and processes of health systems like that of Mongolia, \nwhich were strongly influenced by the Semashko model,6 need comprehensive reengineering to \nmake  them  efficient  and  effective  in  addressing  health  needs  generally  and  needs  of \ndisadvantaged7 groups and the poor in particular. Second, rapid and high turnover of staff in key \nroles and positions makes continuity difficult. Third, effective change needs targeted incentives, \nand these are not always available or readily applicable. Finally, change invariably encounters \nresistance  from  affected  or  threatened  parties,  which  impedes  the  progress  of  reforms. \nContinuity of policy reforms among HSDP, SHSDP, and the Project is illustrated in Appendix 5.  \n \n22.  Lessons. Key lessons have been identified from previous assistance activities: (i) health \nfinancing and service delivery improvements need to be linked; (ii) incentives are needed to \nensure health service quality and optimum staffing levels nationwide; (iii) financial allocations \nneed to support reform programs (e.g., adequate investment and funding is needed for PHC); \n(iv) structures and organizational processes need to be institutionalized in the appropriate key \nagencies (through, for example, dedicated foci and personnel in critical areas like FGPs and \nquality  improvement)  to  ensure  consistent  and  focused  interventions  and  effective \nimplementation of reforms; (v) rural health services need to be strengthened and at the same \ntime refocused; and (vi) public information and awareness needs to be extended to ensure \ncommunity  support  and  promote  healthy  lifestyles.  Lessons  from  HSDP  and  SHSDP  are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix B. \n                                                 \n6  The  Semashko  model  was  a  Soviet-style  centralized,  hierarchical  health  system  with  strong  emphasis  on \nexpensive curative services and hospital-based physicians in extensive and numerous facilities. \n7  The use of the term \u201cvulnerable\u201d has been avoided since according to current government policy \u201cvulnerability\u201d is a \nclassification used for various state benefits and is not necessarily linked to poverty criteria. It includes all citizens \nregardless of socioeconomic status who are under 16 years of age, all mothers of newborn infants, all elderly \npeople, all unemployed people, and all single parents. It excludes unregistered urban residents, students (about \ntwo thirds of whom come from outside Ulaanbaatar), and herders. Disadvantaged people include overlapping \ngroups such as the poor, unregistered migrants, uninsured, informal sector community members, and individuals \nwith special needs (disabled, single-headed families, elderly without pension, homeless, and street children).  \n ", "6 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n23.  The impact of the Project is improved health status and quality of life for the population \nof Mongolia. The outcome of the Project is PHC services that are more effective and improved \nfinancial protection through health insurance. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n24.  The Project has four components: (i) strengthened health services, (ii) improved health \ncare financing and health insurance, (iii) improved HRD, and (iv) sector capacity development \nand management. The four components are in line with specific strategies of the HSMP as \noutlined under each component. Component 1 will focus on five aimags (Arkhangai, Dundogov, \nGobi Altai, Sukhbaatar, and Tuv) that have been selected based on poverty levels, health \nstatus, and levels of development investment, and two duuregs of Ulaanbaatar (Chingeltei and \nSonginokhairkan), each with significant populations of poor and disadvantaged people living in \nger (traditional tent) areas. Profiles of the project aimags are in Appendix 6 and Supplementary \nAppendix C. Components 2, 3, and 4 will focus on policy change and reform of the health sector \nsystem  nationwide,  including  health  financing  and  insurance,  HR,  and  regulation  and \ngovernance. Service delivery and HR initiatives under Components 1 and 3 will also have \nnationwide  impact  on  PHC  policy,  for  example  in  improvements  to  FGPs  and  for  reform \nnationwide (e.g., in improving staffing in rural areas). \n \n25.  The Project was designed through extensive consultation with stakeholders from public, \nprivate, and nongovernmental sectors at the central and local levels. The Project will implement \nparticipatory  mechanisms  at  PHC  (e.g.,  community  consultation  in  management  of  health \nfacilities and services, social workers linking disadvantaged groups to health personnel) and \nhospital  levels  (e.g.,  establishment  of  hospital  boards,  development  of  complaints  and \ncommunication  processes  between  health  facilities  and  the  population)  to  promote  greater \ncommunity involvement in overseeing health facilities and improve transparency of the sector. \n \n1.  Component 1: Strengthened Health Services \n  \n26.  Component 1 supports two strategies of the HSMP: (i) increase coverage, access, and \nutilization  of  health  services,  especially  for  mothers  and  children,  the  poor,  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups; and (ii) strengthen the delivery of quality primary and general care \nthrough soum health facilities and FGPs.8 \n \n27.  Strengthened  FGPs.  The  FGP  system,  established  in  1999\u20132001  under  HSDP, \nrequires further institutional and financial reforms to consolidate the model and to make family \ndoctors attractive and sustainable long term as the first level of PHC. The Project will build two \nnew FGPs, and upgrade the equipment of 60 FGP clinics. The Project will analyze and make \nrecommendations on issues related to the legal, tax, business, and social status of FGPs. The \nProject will study and advise on how to improve (i) FGP gatekeeping function (ensuring that \n                                                 \n8  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction funding is being sought to improve access to health services for disadvantaged \ngroups in Ulaanbaatar. That proposed project has been designed to support the Government\u2019s HSMP. It will \nanalyze constraints and test demand-driven schemes to improve access to health services. The proposed project \nwill support the present Project by demonstrating improved health service models to increase access for urban \ndisadvantaged groups, in particular poor unregistered and uninsured citizens and, hence, will feed into the broader \npolicy objectives of this Project. The poor comprise about 27% of the population of Ulaanbaatar (World Bank 2006) \nand are concentrated in disadvantaged peri-urban areas of the city populated mainly by migrants from rural areas. \nA large proportion of new migrants are unemployed, unregistered, and uninsured for ill health. \n ", "7 \npatients  will  consult  their  FGPs  prior  to  seeking  care  at  hospital  level),  (ii)  risk-adjusted \ncapitation payment, (iii) basic diagnostic testing, and (iv) drug supply in FGPs. The Project will \nstrengthen  advocacy  and  public  information  on  family  doctors  through  national  information \ncampaigns; organize a study tour on FGPs for decision makers; and train local government \nagency staff, who interact with the family doctors, on how best to support the FGP model. The \nProject will support the Department of General Practice at the Health Sciences University of \nMongolia in providing postgraduate education of family doctors and the Ulaanbaatar City Health \nDepartment in providing in-service training to FGPs. \n \n28.  Strengthened SHCs in Providing Primary Care. The Project will construct 15 new \nSHCs, upgrade infrastructure in four SHCs, and establish 20 wells at SHC level. The Project will \nalso provide medical equipment to around 90 SHCs and basic laboratory technology to about \n100 SHCs. The Project will provide training for SHC staff (doctors, nurses, feldshers) in PHC, \ndisease surveillance, chronic diseases, and health promotion. The Project will study and make \nrecommendations on realigning SHCs towards PHC with less reliance on in-patient services \nand more emphasis on outreach, home services, and prevention. The reorganization of soum \nhospitals to improve rural health service delivery is in Supplementary Appendix D. The Project \nwill improve electronic communication between SHCs and AGHs to allow remote consultations \nand transfer of data and educational material by providing hardware, software, and training. \nWith the strengthened focus on SHCs and FGP, per capita expenditures on PHC will increase \nto $17 in 2013. \n \n29.  District and Aimag General Hospitals. The Project will upgrade infrastructure in three \nAGHs and equip five AGHs and two duureg hospitals. The Project will also renovate and equip \ntraining facilities in five AGHs and two district hospitals to support FGPs and soum health \nworkers\u2019 continuous training. The Project will establish linkages between FGPs and district and \naimag  general  hospitals  by  supporting  continuous  medical  education  and  clinical  rotation \nprograms for FGPs and soum doctors, enhancing electronic consultation and communication \nwith hospital specialists, and developing incentive mechanisms for AGHs and district staff to \nsupport FGPs and SHCs. \n \n2.  Component 2: Improved Health Care Financing and Health Insurance \n   \n30.  Component 2 supports two strategies of the HSMP: (i) strengthen financial management \nsystem  to  improve  the  efficient  and  effective  use  of  health  sector  financial  and  related \nresources, and (ii) strengthen the health insurance system. \n \n31.  Health  Resource  Allocation  and  Purchasing.  The  Project  will  design  and  reach \nconsensus among primarily the MOH, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Social Welfare \nand  Labor  (MSWL)  on  the  status,  organizational  structure,  responsibilities,  management \nsystems, and processes necessary to establish and operate a single purchaser and to pool \nfunds  from  the  Government\u2019s  budget  and  health  insurance.  The  alignment  of  the  single \npurchaser model with the current budget and health insurance systems will be clarified. Results \nof the new model will be carefully monitored and a contingency plan will be in place in case the \nnew financing system is not successful. The Project will facilitate contracting arrangements with \nhospitals to help raise health care quality standards and efficiency in hospitals. The Project will \nundertake the necessary HRD and institutional capacity development to test and implement the \nsingle purchaser model and organize a study tour on single purchasing for decision makers. \n \n32.  Improved  Financial  Protection  and  Expanded  Health  Insurance  Coverage.  The \nProject will focus on expanding health insurance coverage (to attain 85% coverage by 2013) \nand benefits. Currently, health insurance cover in Mongolia is declining and there are few \nincentives and programs to extend health insurance to the informal sector or to the uninsured \npopulation. This presents significant access barriers, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. \n ", "8 \nThe Project will study the uninsured population, the extent of financial barriers, and the effects \nand  implications  of  out-of-pocket  payments.  The  Project  will  develop  options  and \nimplementation mechanisms to establish a financially independent health insurance system, \nincrease  contributions  (including  from  the  informal  sector),  promote  participation  in  health \ninsurance, subsidize disadvantaged populations, and optimize benefit packages. The potential \nfor  increased  private  health  insurance,  along  with  more  effective  state  regulation,  will  be \nreviewed under the Project. Health care financing and health insurance issues are presented in \ndetail in Supplementary Appendix E. A description of major Mongolian health laws and policies \nand considerations for the Project is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n33.  Improved  Hospital  Financial  Efficiency.  Public hospitals represent nearly 60% of \ngovernment health expenditures and show poor results. The Project will develop options to \nintroduce  market  elements  (management  performance  contracts,  pricing  flexibility,  and \nincentives) in hospital service provision in order to increase competition among hospitals. The \nProject  will  also  review  and  recommend  to  MOH  measures  to  increase  hospital  financial \nautonomy  by,  among  others,  establishing  hospital  and/or  health  boards  for  improving \ngovernance and efficiency while increasing consumers\u2019 participation in line with the HSMP. The \nProject  will  raise  awareness  among  public  financial  specialists  and  managers  on  hospital \nfinancial efficiency (e.g., linking budget and performance, incentive mechanisms) and develop \nand conduct training to improve the efficiency of hospital finance and management. \n \n3.  Component 3: Improved Human Resources Development  \n \n34.  Component 3 supports two strategies of the HSMP: (i) strengthen human resource \nmanagement sector wide, and (ii) further develop the incentives and motivation scheme for all \nhealth workers in the sector. \n \n35.  Improved Health HR Management. The Project will develop workforce models to guide \nstaff numbers, competencies, and organizational structures; assist in career development; and \ntrain health sector HR staff to institutionalize HR capacity. The Project will provide technical \nsupport to the secretariat of the High Level HR Coordinating Committee, which is developing \nstrategic human resource development initiatives. These measures will impact on the entire \nhealth sector by increasing training places and numbers of such key personnel as nurses and \nfeldshers, realigning nurse-doctor ratios, and enhancing career development opportunities in \nhealth to achieve a better balanced workforce. The Project will also assist in consolidating family \nmedicine as a clinical specialty. \n \n36.  Incentives to Improve Rural Health Care. There are critical shortages of key health \npersonnel in rural areas while poor career development opportunities and incentives deter \nhealth professionals from working in the countryside. Through applied research, the Project will \nidentify the main drivers to recruit and retain health workers in rural areas\u2014including salary \nlevels  and  social  welfare  elements\u2014and  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  incentive \npackages to increase the numbers of doctors and nurses in SHCs and specialists in AGHs.  \n \n4.  Component 4: Sector Capacity Development and Management \n \n37.  Component 4 links to two strategies of the HSMP: (i) strengthen and integrate ongoing \nhealth sector reform using a sector wide approach (SWAp), and (ii) establish an optimal public \nand private mix of health care services. \n \n38.  Improved Capacity to Implement the HSMP and Engage in Intersectoral Dialogue. \nThe Government is committed to the HSMP and to sector-wide management of the health \nsystem. The Project will support this process by providing capacity development for MOH, \nincluding the National Center for Health Development, in planning, coordinating, and budgeting \n ", "9 \nto facilitate sector-wide coordination in the short-term and management in the midterm. The \nProject will assist MOH in organizing and implementing joint annual reviews of the HSMP \nimplementation with major stakeholders in the sector and strengthen the recently established \nHSMP Implementation Coordination Committee and its equivalent at aimag level to gradually \nbring health stakeholders under the umbrella of the HSMP. This will allow for an effective \ndialogue on broad issues that require interministerial agreements, such as HR and health \ninsurance reforms. \n \n39.  Improved Health Sector Governance. A project focus will be identifying optimal health \nsystem organization and structure with an emphasis on consumer and patient involvement and \ninteractions. The Project will revisit and pilot the hospital/health board concept to provide more \nautonomy to hospitals that was introduced initially under HSDP, and it will organize a study tour \non  hospital  autonomy.  The  Project  will  also  develop,  pilot,  and  implement  participatory \nmechanisms for patients and consumers (e.g., clients\u2019 rights and charters, public reporting, and \ntransparent complaints and communication processes).  \n \n40.  Private  Sector  Policy  and  Guidelines. The private sector in health care is poorly \nregulated and regulation is institutionally fragmented. The private sector is rapidly developing in \nan  environment  in  which  the  Government  has  little  experience  in  designing  proper  legal, \nregulatory, and contractual frameworks to monitor performances, ensure quality of care, and \nenforce licensing and accreditation requirements. The Project will assist MOH in developing \nregulatory frameworks and mechanisms for private health operations, financing, and licensing. \nCriteria to improve the distribution of hospital services and assess competency, quality, and \nstandards in the private sector will be developed. The Project will also review and develop \noptions for public-private cooperation in providing health services, including the potential for \nmodern technology to be more widely available to the community and for increased access to \nquality treatment and diagnostic services. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n41.  Pro-poor  Orientation.  The  Project  is  designed  to  increase  access  to  PHC  while \nimproving its quality. The poor, disadvantaged, women, and elderly are the major users of \nFGPs, and rural poor populations are the major clients of SHCs. Upgrading and improving FGP \nand SHC services directly benefits the poor. The Project will assist the Government in extending \nhealth insurance coverage to the poor and uninsured, to increase access to services, and to \nhelp in preventing impoverishment through unanticipated large health-related payments. \n \n42.  Improving Health Care Financing and Health Insurance. The Project aims to improve \nhealth financing policy to increase allocative and technical efficiency through pooling of state \nand Health Insurance Funds and the development of a single purchaser of health care services \nunder the Public Sector Finance Management Law. That law emphasizes funding based on \noutputs.  Financing  through  purchasing  and  associated  contracting  arrangements  between \npurchaser and provider that specifies levels and types of care and treatment delivered will help \nto raise standards, quality of care, and efficiency in hospitals. \n \n43.  Private  Sector  Regulation  and  Public-Private  Partnership.  The  private  hospital \nsector in Mongolia has expanded rapidly without regulation or control. Consequences include a \nlack of public assurance for the safety and quality of care provided, public financing through \nhealth insurance with little information on outcomes or results, and mushrooming of small \nprivate hospitals adding little value for consumers but increasing health care expenditures. The \nProject will assist MOH in developing regulatory frameworks and mechanisms to review private \noperations, financing, and licensing; as well as develop criteria to improve the distribution of \nhospital services and assess competency, quality, and standards in the private sector. The \n ", "10 \nProject will also review and develop options for public-private cooperation in providing health \nservices, including the potential for making modern technology more widely available to the \ncommunity and for increasing access to quality treatment and diagnostic services. The Project \nwill  assist  the  MOH  in  developing  its  private-sector  regulatory  and  monitoring  capacity  to \nimprove private sector performance and better integrate the private and public health sectors. \n \n44.  Sector-Wide Management and Donor Coordination. The Project\u2019s support for sector-\nwide arrangements will strengthen MOH\u2019s capacity to coordinate stakeholder activities in health, \nleading  to  improved  sector  coordination  and  planning  in  the  medium-term  and  improved \nmanagement of sector inputs in the longer term. The Project will (i) support implementation of \njoint  annual  reviews  of  the  sector  with  major  stakeholders;  (ii)  assist  MOH  in  developing \ncommon management arrangements to improve the government-led SWAp; and (iii) strengthen \nthe  HSMP  Implementation  Coordination  Committee,  which  oversees  all  health  activities  of \nnational and international partners in the sector and provides a venue for intersectoral dialogue \non such broad issues as the reform of health insurance. The Project will also support the High \nLevel HR Coordinating Committee to promote intersectoral collaboration in developing and \nimplementing health sector human resources, policies, and strategic plans. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n45.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $17.6  million  equivalent.  A  summary  of  cost \nestimates is in Table 1.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n47.  Implementation  arrangements  take  into  account  the  experience  of  previous  ADB-\nsupported projects in the health sector. MOH will be the Executing Agency for the Project and \nwill be responsible for its overall implementation. To provide strategic orientation and overall \nguidance on Project implementation, a project steering committee (PSC) has been established, \nchaired by the state secretary of MOH and composed of senior officials from MOH, MSWL, \nMOF, the State Social Insurance General Office, and Health Sciences University of Mongolia, \nUlaanbaatar City, as well as representatives of project aimags and duuregs and the Mongolian \nAssociation  of  Family  Doctors.  The  PSC  will  serve  as  a  mechanism  for  private  sector \nparticipation in the Project. The five project aimags will establish supervisory groups, chaired by \nthe aimag governors\u2019 offices and composed of representatives of the health departments, AGHs, \nand SHCs. The two project duuregs will establish supervisory groups, chaired by the duureg \ngovernor\u2019s  office  and  composed  of  the  district  health  alliance,  district  general  hospital, \nUlaanbaatar city health department and FGPs. The PSC and supervisory groups will meet \nquarterly and be responsible for approving the annual project budget and activity plan, as well \nas for reviewing and advising on implementation progress. The minutes of PSC meetings will be \nforwarded to ADB on a quarterly basis. Working groups to advise and assist with project \nimplementation  will  be  established  centrally  and  in  pilot  areas.  Detailed  implementation \narrangements  are  in  Appendix  8  and  the  financial  management  assessment  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n48.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up in MOH and will be responsible for \nproject coordination and day-to-day implementation of project activities, including supervising \nconstruction; procuring equipment and materials; disbursement; providing support in selecting \nconsultants, engaging consultants, and managing their supervision and monitoring of the work \nprogram and project performance; and reporting on progress, including to prepare the quarterly \nand annual project monitoring and progress reports. The PIU will consult closely with relevant \nhealth facilities, agencies, and international partners. The PIU will be headed by a qualified \nproject manager selected on a competitive basis. The PIU will comprise five staff, including a \nplanning  and  human  resources  officer,  administration  and  finance  officer,  civil  works  and \nprocurement officer, secretary, and driver, for the entire implementation period of the Project. In \neach project aimag, a project coordinator will be appointed to oversee implementation of the \nProject  at  the  local  level.  That  coordinator  will  be  assisted  by  staff  for  training,  quality \nimprovement, procurement, and civil works that is to be engaged intermittently or on a part-time \nbasis, as necessary. Implementation in Ulaanbaatar duuregs will be coordinated through the \nPIU. All PIU staff, including aimag level coordinators and their staff, whose salaries are paid \nfrom the proceeds of the grant, will be selected and contracted individually in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n ", "12 \n2.  Implementation Period \n49.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  2008  to  2013.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n50.  The procurement of goods and works financed under the grant will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) will be applied to supply contracts estimated to cost \n$500,000  or  more.  Supply  contracts  with  values  less  than  $500,000  will  follow  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB), and those less than $100,000 will follow shopping procedures as \nreflected by particular circumstances of the contract packages. International competitive bidding \nwill be used for civil works contracts valued at $1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued at \nless than $1 million will be procured using NCB procedures. NCB procurement will be done on \nthe basis of NCB procedures in accordance with the Mongolian Procurement Law, subject to \nmodifications agreed with ADB. The internationally tendered equipment packages will include \nthe necessary technical support for ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and \ntraining  of  operational  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  In  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  NCB  contracts.  External \nmonitoring of quality of civil works will be established. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n51.  The Project will require a total of 57 person-months of international and 312 person-\nmonths of national consulting services financed under the ADB grant. The international and \nnational consultants will have expertise in (i) PHC services, (ii) public health, (iii) civil works, (iv) \nmedical equipment, (v) information and communication technology network development, (vi) \nhealth care financing and health insurance, (vii) HR management and development, (viii) health \nplanning, (ix) private health services planning and provision, and (x) monitoring and evaluation. \nOther national consultants will have expertise in (i) legal issues on the legal, tax, business, and \nsocial status of FGPs; (ii) web design; and (iii) gender and development. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  Selected  international  consultants  (information  and \ncommunication technology, health planning and management, monitoring and evaluation) and \nnational consultants (legal expert, web designer, information and communication technology, \nhealth planning and management, gender and development, monitoring and evaluation) will be \nselected and contracted individually as the assignments are straightforward and MOH\u2019s main \nrequirements are the consultants\u2019 qualifications and experience. Using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure (quality-cost ratio of 80:20), the remaining international and national \nconsultants will be selected and contracted through short-listed international consulting firms. \nIndicative  consultancy  requirements  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOH.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOH and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \n ", "13 \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. For the Project, MOH will establish a \nmechanism for external monitoring of the quality of civil works; and launch a project-specific \nwebsite for disclosing project activities and achievements. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through timely \nrelease of grant proceeds, the PIU will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services are (i) procured from ADB\u2019s \nmember countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited in the \nimprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the \ngrant amount, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure may be used to \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible expenditures that do not exceed $50,000 per individual \npayment. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  The Government, through the PIU, will (i) maintain separate financial accounts for the \nProject,  and  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Grant \nAgreement and as specified in ADB\u2019s financial reporting and auditing standards.9 The auditors \nshould have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. The use of \nthe imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be part of the annual audit and a \nseparate audit opinion will be submitted. The Government will submit to ADB certified copies (in \nEnglish) of such audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the related reports of the \nauditors, within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. The Government was advised that \nADB requires timely submission of audited projects accounts and financial statements and that \nit will suspend disbursements of the proposed ADB grant in case of noncompliance with the \nrequirement. \n \n55.  For the purpose of complying with the requirements for the annual audited financial \nstatements, the proceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for private financial \nstatements, sector auditors, and translations of auditor\u2019s reports into English. The PIU will \nsubmit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the Government on all \naspects of project implementation. The reports will include details on overall implementation \nprogress, problems encountered during the reporting period, measures taken or proposed to be \ntaken to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of activities for the following \nquarter. Within 3 months of project completion, the PIU will prepare and submit to ADB, in a \nformat acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on (i) the utilization and impact of the \ngrant; (ii) performance of the Project; (iii) economic and social benefits generated; and (iv) \ndetails about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring System  \n56.  MOH will establish a comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) \nacceptable to ADB. The PPMS will assess performance by (i) evaluating delivery of planned \nactivities; (ii) measuring Project impacts; (iii) measuring health, social, and economic benefits \nwith a focus on the poor, women, and disadvantaged groups; and (iv) monitoring achievement \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n \n ", "14 \nof MDGs and other Government targets. PPMS indicators will serve as a basis to prepare \nreports on project implementation and the reform process, improved use of resources, improved \naccess to services (particularly for the poor), improved service quality, client satisfaction, and \nprogress in achieving MDGs. Performance indicators are set out in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) and an indicative list of monitoring and evaluation indicators (based on \nreview  of  the  Mongolian  health  management  information  system)  for  use  in  PPMS  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. Some indicators will be monitored through surveys financed under \nthe Project, while others will be monitored through routine administrative and financial data. \nWhere  feasible,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  socioeconomic  level  and  gender.  The \nmonitoring and evaluation consultants will assist MOH and PIU to determine Project-specific \nindicators and develop a cost-effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation system.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n57.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake reviews of the Project at least twice a \nyear. The reviews will assess progress in each component, identify issues and constraints, and \ndetermine necessary remedial actions and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted \nduring the third year of implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the scope, design, \nand implementation arrangements and identify adjustments required; (ii) assess progress of the \nproject implementation against performance indicators; and (iii) recommend changes in the \ndesign or implementation arrangements, if necessary.   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n58.  The targeted outcome of the Project is effective PHC and improved financial protection \nthrough health insurance, which will positively impact on health status and Mongolians\u2019 quality \nof life, especially in rural settings and in poor areas of Ulaanbaatar under the Project.  By \nstrengthening the FGP model, urban populations will gain increased access to better quality \nPHC services, including treatment, prevention, and health education. FGPs specifically benefit \nthe poor, as more than 60% of clients are below the poverty threshold and include women, \nyoung  children,  and  the  elderly.  By  improving  rural  health  services  through  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  equipment,  enhancing  staff  skills  and  optimizing  the  number  of  key  health \nprofessionals, the Project will benefit populations in rural areas, where health outcomes and \naccess are poorer than for urban Mongolians. The Project will directly benefit almost 700,000 \npeople in five aimags and the two duuregs of Ulaanbaatar (26.8% of the total population).  \n \n59.  Policy measures, capacity development, and HRD under the Project will benefit the \nentire  population  through  nationwide  components  aimed  at  improving  health  system \neffectiveness. Policy measures under the Project will strengthen health financing policy aimed at \nincreasing population health insurance coverage and benefits packages; focus on payment for \nquality services, which will enhance patient care; and improve technical and allocative efficiency \nin hospitals, to the direct benefit of patients. Other specific project benefits include improved \ntechnical  capacity  (through  increased  skills  and  capacity  of  FGPs  and  soum  health  staff); \nimproved guidelines and standards of care; increased financing capacity of MOH and local \ngovernment staff; increased planning plus improved budgeting, monitoring, and evaluation skills \nin  the  health  sector;  and  improved  institutional  operations  and  functioning  (through  a \nstrengthened MOH, stronger intersectoral collaboration, SHCs better aligned with rural health \nneeds, and a more effective referral and networking system). \n \n60.  The Project will impact on population health and MDG goals and targets by improving \naccess; increasing service quality; facilitating financial protection for health care; increasing \nprofessional  capacity  development,  policy,  planning  and  implementation  capability;  and \n ", "15 \nestablishing system regulation. Training of rural health staff in PHC and in essential clinical care \nand  management  will  assist  in  addressing  the  burden  of  disease  in  Mongolia  (especially \nmanagement  of  maternal  and  child  health  care;  men\u2019s  health;  and  chronic  diseases  like \ncardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, and diabetes). Developing sound clinical guidelines and \npractices will enable more effective and outcome-based clinical services in FGPs and SHCs. \nImproving communication and networking among FGPs, SHCs, and hospital specialists will \nallow more rapid and effective diagnosis and treatment for remote and rural populations. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction and Social Dimensions \n \n61.  Poverty and health are closely related, and better health services contribute importantly \nto economic development. Overall, the Project aims to improve and extend PHC services and \npolicies to benefit the Mongolian population, in particular, the rural and urban poor, women, \nchildren,  and  the  elderly.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  whole  population  indirectly  through \nnationwide components that support health sector reform and sector-wide and intersectoral \nmanagement capacity development. Under the component for strengthening health services, \nwhere most of the Project funds are allocated, there are more than 700,000 people. Among \nthese, more than 40% of the population in the project aimags is poor, compared to the national \naverage of 36%. The Project activities specifically target poor, marginalized, and underserved \ngroups by, for example, improving PHC coverage and service delivery, introducing community \ninvolvement mechanisms, and facilitating financial protection for the poor.  \n \n62.  The Project will contribute to achieving MDGs, particularly Goal 4 (reduce the under-five \nmortality rate by two thirds and the infant mortality rate from 63.4 to 22 per thousand live births; \nincrease the percentage of children vaccinated against measles from 82.5% to 96%), Goal 5 \n(improve maternal health by reducing the maternal mortality rate from 200 to 50 per 100,000 live \nbirths,  increase  the  proportion  of  births  attended  by  skilled  health  personnel  from  96.8  to \n99.8%), and Goal 6 (combat sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and such communicable \ndiseases as tuberculosis by halting and, by 2015, beginning to reverse the spread of these \ndiseases). The Project\u2019s summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \nDetailed poverty and social, and gender analyses are in supplementary appendixes I and J, \nrespectively. \n \n63.  The Project will help to improve women\u2019s health through its strong focus on PHC, which \nis predominantly accessed by women. Gender disaggregated data will be collected to monitor \nthe Project\u2019s effects on women and men. Women will be encouraged to participate in planning \nand implementing the Project. By improving health education and health promotion, the Project \nis expected to impact on declining adult male health outcomes. A gender plan is in Appendix 13.  \n \n64.  The project preparation activities were guided by participatory processes undertaken in \nthe project areas. Focus group and stakeholder discussions were held and indicated a range of \nhealth and social concerns in the community, including the needs for (i) increased consultation \nwith local communities, (ii) improved access to rural health services (SHCs are mainly used by \npoorer people, women, and the elderly), and (iii) improved outreach and community health \neducation. A national information campaign on strengthening the role of FGPs will be designed \nand implemented. \n \nC.  Social Safeguards \n \n65.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Project  will  construct  14  SHCs,  one \ninter-SHC and two FGP centers in the five project aimags and two duuregs of Ulaanbaatar. The \nconstruction of SHCs and FGP centers will be on existing government land and will not affect \n ", "16 \ncommunity members.10 During project implementation, should there be change in the scope or \nother  changes  with  unanticipated  resettlement  impacts,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities will be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \n66.  Ethnic Minority Issues. There are over 30 ethnic groups in Mongolia. Most Mongolians \nare Khalkh (81.5%), and minority groups account for 18.5% of the population. A substantial \nethnic minority group (Dariganga) exists in Sukhbaatar, while minority groups are very small in \nother project aimags. Consultation with representatives of the Dariganga ethnic minority group \nin Sukhbaatar showed that they are not considered to be economically, socially, or legally \nmarginalized or otherwise disadvantaged in a manner which would restrict their access to health \nservices or affect their health status. The Constitution of Mongolia indicates that no person will \nbe discriminated against based on ethnic origin and guarantees equal access to education and \nhealth for ethnic minorities. The cultural distinction, health, and socioeconomic status of this \ngroup, as revealed through data collection during project preparation, are similar to those of \nother Mongolians. Given the equal levels of social indicators between the Khalkh majority and \nethnic minorities, no indigenous people\u2019s development plan or special actions in favor of any \nparticular group are needed.  \n \nD.  Economic and Financial Impacts \n  \n67.  The Project has a strong focus on improving the institutional, operational, and financial \nefficiency  of  the  Mongolian  health  system.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  were \ncalculated  for  the  Project,  and  main  benefits  quantified  were  resource  cost  savings  and \nproductivity gains.  \n \n68.  Resource cost savings consist of reducing out-of-pocket expenses for health care as a \nresult of reforms in health financing. Productivity gains are the results of less time lost to illness \nthat would have otherwise been utilized in some economic activity. Productivity gains will also \nbe realized through less time being spent for the care of sick family members. Direct and \nindirect health benefits are potentially significant due to fewer days lost at work and school and \ngeneral improvement in health status and life. The analysis does not attempt to quantify all \neconomic  gains  and  provides  only  conservative  estimates  based  on  quantifiable  benefit \nstreams. Overall investments under the Project are expected, however, to yield significant \neconomic, social, and institutional benefits. The Project yields a 22.8% EIRR and a net present \nvalue of MNT11.3 billion. The net present value calculation discounts the cost and benefit \nstreams  at  12%  in  real  terms.  The  economic  and  financial  analyses  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 14 and set out in detail in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n69.  Financial  goals  of  the  Project  include  improving  allocative  efficiency  in  health  care \nexpenditure (shifting funding away from hospitals to PHC) and improving internal operating \nefficiency and financial management in service delivery, thus reducing health care costs for \nindividuals  and  the  community  overall.  Incremental  recurrent  costs  of  the  Project  are \nmanageable and arise largely from increased operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for the \nfacilities constructed and upgraded under the Project. \n  \n70.  The financial analysis evaluates the impact of the Project on the Government budget. \nThe Project\u2019s total financing cost, inclusive of taxes, duties, and contingencies, is $17.6 million \nfor around 5 years. The Government\u2019s annual share in Project costs will average approximately \n$719,000 equivalent (MNT867 million), or less than 1% of the projected annual health sector \nbudget of about $87.2 million. The recurrent costs to be borne by the Government during project \nimplementation are estimated to be about $107,000 equivalent (MNT128 million) per year. \n                                                 \n10 The MOH provided a letter, dated 16 May 2007, giving assurance that the new SHCs, inter-SHC and FGPs will be \nconstructed on government land that is not currently in use or occupied by anyone. \n ", "17 \nThese include the operating expenses of the PIU and O&M and replacement costs of new and \nupgraded health facilities and equipment. FGPs under the Project will continue to be funded by \nthe Government during and after project implementation. The budgetary impact of the estimated \nannual  recurrent  costs  during  implementation  of  the  Project  is  considered  minimal.  Soum \ngovernments  will  share  in  the  O&M  costs  for  the  rehabilitated  SHCs.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to providing the funds necessary to ensure the sustainability of the investments.  \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n71.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out in the five project aimags in \naccordance  with  Government  Laws  and  Regulations  on  the  environment  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.11 Extensive  public \nconsultations, including surveys,  meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions, \nwere undertaken during preparation of the IEE. The project IEE was reviewed by the aimag\u2019s \nenvironment department in accordance with the law on Environment Impact Assessment.  \n \n72.  The Project will not adversely affect natural resources, the ecology, or cultural and/or \nhistorical sites. A limited number of specific environmental and social impacts may result from \nthe project implementation, but these can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally \nrecognized performance standards, guidelines, and design criteria. The Project will enhance \nenvironmental features of the hospitals, provide safe water supply, and ensure appropriate \nmedical waste management. Newly constructed and upgraded SHC and AGH buildings will \nenhance energy efficiency and building standards. The Project will have positive social impacts, \nincluding to improve rural health care services and the quality of life for people in project areas. \nCivil works in the Project will ensure that no additional environmental problems are created by \nspecifying  appropriate  design  features,  heating  and  ventilation  systems,  and  wastewater \ncollection  systems.  A  synopsis  of  the  IEE  is  in  Appendix  15  and  the  summary  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n73.  The first risk is that government support and commitment to health sector development \nand reform will diminish. The Project will mitigate this risk through continuing policy dialogue \nwith the Government and donor community in the context of the HSMP. By building on the \npolicy  platform  established,  and  by  continuing  the  reform  agenda,  the  risk  of  diminishing \nGovernment or agency commitment will be managed. Project involvement in such intersectoral \nprocesses  as  the  joint  annual  reviews  of  the  HSMP  implementation,  National  Health \nDevelopment Strategy and National Policy Development initiatives under the HSMP, and the \nHigh Level HR Coordinating Committee to strengthen national HR policy and strategy will assist \nin maintaining the Government\u2019s support and attention. \n \n74.  The second risk area relates to slow progress or resistance to reforms due to (i) high \nturnover of officials and senior technical staff in key agencies as a result of frequent leadership \nchanges, and (ii) resistance of key staff groups (e.g., hospital specialists), agencies (e.g., State \nSocial Insurance General Office), sectors (e.g., the private hospitals), and the community to \nchange and reform. The first will be addressed through close monitoring and dialogue with MOH \nand  support  to  the  HSMP  Implementation  Coordination  Committee.  The  second  will  be \nmitigated through project information campaigns, raising awareness, and training. \n \n75.  A third risk is MOF\u2019s resistance to single purchasing and pooling of funds as a major \nelement of financing reform. To mitigate this risk, the Project will promote pooling and single \npurchasing  as  measures  that  will  reduce  transaction  costs,  conform  to  the  Public  Sector \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003.

ASSURANCES \n \n76.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,12 the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the Grant Agreement.  \n \n77.  Project Implementation Unit. Before grant effectiveness, the Government will ensure \nthe establishment of the PIU in MOH, in a manner acceptable to ADB. The PIU will be headed \nby a qualified project manager selected on a competitive basis and will include a planning and \nhuman resources officer, an administration and finance officer, a civil works and procurement \nofficer, a secretary, and a driver. \n \n78.  FGPs. Within 18 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will provide a plan \nbased on research and analysis, acceptable to ADB, detailing the major legal issues to be \naddressed  in  the  health  sector  to  clarify  and  resolve  the  optimal  legal  framework  for  the \noperations of FGPs. The plan will outline the necessary laws, orders, and amendments that will \nneed to be introduced to improve FGPs\u2019 legal, tax, business, and social status, including FGPs\u2019 \nrole as a gatekeeper, the referral arrangements, and the financial requirements. \n \n79.  Within 18 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will establish a risk-adjusted \ncapitation process for FGPs set at attractive levels to ensure adequate remuneration for doctors \nand nurses, as well as incentives to build up the FGP practice. The institutionalized risk-\nadjusted capitation process will be developed and agreed in consultation with MOF and the \nMongolian Association of Family Doctors and reviewed and updated regularly on a yearly basis. \n \n80.  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will prepare a draft funding \nplan  for  incentives  for  FGPs  to  allow  additional  (bonus)  funding  for  achieving  quality, \nperformance  and  service  targets.  FGP  performance  contracts  will  be  amended  to  reflect \nimprovement targets and processes and will be developed collaboratively with FGPs, MOF, \nlocal health departments, and local government offices.  \n \n81.  Incentive  Package  Mechanism.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will prepare a draft plan with identified incentive funding and salary packages, time \nframes, and other required resources to encourage staff transfers to areas of staff shortage in \naimags.  The  incentive  package  mechanism  will  be  a  long  term  commitment  instituted  in \nappropriate  ministries,  including  MOH  and  MSWL,  and  reviewed  annually  and  reported  in \nconnection with Project progress reviews. \n \n82.  Within  18  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  researched, \nidentified, established, and supported additional training places for rural staff including nurses \nand feldshers. At least 20 funded places in medical/nursing schools per year and per staff group \nwill be provided for students, with additional incentives, as appropriate. Guaranteed positions \nwill be available for new graduates, and training schemes advertised and promoted in aimags to \nencourage young students to apply. \n \n83.  Within 9 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will establish a process to \nreview SHC organization and develop a plan within 1 year, acceptable to ADB, for the long term \nstructure, extent and reorganization of SHCs and the rural health sector. The aim for SHCs \nshould be to move towards centers of primary care with mainly ambulatory and outreach focus.  \n \n                                                 \n12 The full list of assurances is included in the Grant Agreement. \n ", "19 \n84.  Civil Works and Equipment. Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, the Government \nwill provide a civil works and equipment plan acceptable to ADB. The plan will (i) outline the \nnumber and location of new facilities to be renovated under the Project, and (ii) develop a \nmaster plan to upgrade the health facilities under the Project.  Provision of Civil works and \nequipment will be prioritized for the improvement of PHC services. \n \n85.  The Government will ensure that construction of SHCs and FGPs is carried out on \nexisting Government\u2019s land. In the event of (i) any unanticipated or unforeseen involuntary \nresettlement, (ii) land acquisition, and (iii) resettlement activities during project implementation \nthe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  Laws  and \nregulations in Mongolia. In the event of discrepancies between the Government\u2019s Laws and \nregulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy shall prevail.  \n \n86.  Within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of the requirements for monitoring and mitigation included in the summary IEE, \nas agreed between the Government and ADB. \n \n87.

Overview \n \n1.  Organizational Structure. From the 1920s to the 1990s, Mongolia had centralized the \nhierarchical  health  system.  Health  services  were  fully  financed  and  delivered  by  the \nGovernment, with a strong orientation towards curative services that relied greatly on hospital-\nbased physicians and strong central control. Dismantling this legacy has proved challenging in \nreforming the health care system.   \n \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s  health  care  system  is  one  statutory  system  organized  by  administrative \ndivisions. In addition to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, there are 21 aimags (provinces), each of \nwhich is split into smaller soums (districts). Soums are further divided into 3\u20134 smaller bags \n(village units), depending on their population sizes. Decentralization of the health care system \nstarted in the mid-1990s in response to reduced central government funding for health.  \n \n3.  Provision  of  Services.  In  urban  areas,  primary  health  care  (PHC)  services  are \ndelivered  by  family  group  practices  (FGPs),  which  were  initiated  under  the  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Program (HSDP) that was financed by Asian Development Bank (ADB). In rural \nareas, PHCs are provided by soum health centers (SHCs) and bag feldshers (community \nnurses), who are medically trained primary health care workers at the smallest administrative \nunit. Feldshers report to SHCs through regular meetings and visits and, in case of emergencies, \nrefer clients to SHCs or inter-SHCs.  \n \n4.  Specialized  care  is  delivered  by  aimag  general  hospitals  (AGH)  and  urban  district \nhospitals, which cover all major clinical specialties and typically have capacities of 200\u2013300 \nbeds for delivering inpatient services. The next level of specialized care is provided through the \nstate clinical hospitals and specialized health centers. These are located mainly in Ulaanbaatar, \nbut also through the three regional treatment and diagnostic centers. Private sector provision of \nhealth care is mainly concentrated in Ulaanbaatar.  \n \n5.  Health Indicators. Despite relatively low per capita income, Mongolia has quite strong \nhealth indicators. Since 1994, the trend in both under-five mortality and infant mortality has been \nconsistently downwards. \n \n6.  On  average,  Mongolia\u2019s  infant  mortality  rate  is  significantly  less  than  that  of  other \ncountries with similar gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Under-five mortality is below the \naverage of low-income countries and life expectancy at birth (65 in 2003) is higher than average \nfor low-income countries.

Disaggregated by region, all aimags have shown declines in infant and child mortality, \nattributable in great part to high levels of vaccination. The steady and continuous decline in both \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \ninfant and child mortality, as reported by the National Statistical Office suggests that Mongolia is \non track for achieving the Millennium Development Goal target.  \n \n8.  The maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 93 deaths per 100,000 live births (2005) is still \nrelatively  high  compared  to  neighboring  countries.  After  rising  in  2001,  MMR  has  been \nconsistently going down.1 \n \n9.  While the overall MMR has decreased, there is significant variation in mortality across \nthe country, with some aimags recording rates three times higher than the national average. \nWhile child and maternal mortality appear to be declining, adult mortality rates are rising. This \nepidemiological transition is similar to those in other post-Soviet countries. Male adult mortality \nis  almost  double  that  of  females  (Table  A2.3).  Major  causes  of  death  are  cardiovascular \ndisease, cancer, and injury. These are partly attributable to high rates of smoking (50% of adult \nmales smoke and the prevalence among women is increasing) and alcohol consumption. \n \n10.  High rates of lifestyle diseases and mortality point to the need for more PHC, prevention, \nand  health  education.  Among  communicable  diseases,  tuberculosis  is  a  major  issue.  Its \nincidence rose from 79 to 175 per 100,000 between 1990 and 2005.2 A major poverty related \ncondition is malnutrition in children, especially in rural areas. In 1990, 6% of children were \nunderweight, and this rose to 12% in 2000. In rural areas, fat consumption is high and anemia is \nprevalent in children and pregnant women. These conditions are amendable to primary health \nand health education interventions and public health campaigns targeting healthy lifestyles.  \n  \n11.  Health System Indicators. Table A2.4 compares Mongolian health system indicators \nwith similar transitional countries. The main points to be inferred for Mongolia are the high \nnumber of hospitals, long length of hospitalization relative to developed health systems, and low \nratios of nurses to population (as well as low ratios relative to doctor numbers). \n \nTable A2.4: Health System Indicators for Mongolia and Selected Countries in 2004\u20132005 \n              OP    Public \n  Hospitals  Beds  Doctors  Nurses      Contacts  THE as  Spending \n  per  per  per  per  Length  Occ  per  % of  as % of \nCountry  100,000  100,000  100,000  100,000  of Stay  Rate  Year  GDP  THE  \nKazakhstan  7.03  776  366.5  644.6  12.8  93.2  6.6  3.9  62.4 \nKyrgyz   \nRepublic  2.85  511  252.5  582.8  12.1  88.8  3.9  5.4  41 \nLatvia  4.47  768  315.5  544.6  10.0  \u2014  5.2  6.4  51.6 \nLithuania  5.07  812  399.0  742.8  10.2  78.6  6.7  6.5  75.4 \nTajikistan  6.9  623  203.9  443.8  12.0  58.6  4.2  4.5  22.9 \nUzbekistan  3.7  519  269.7  1,023.0  10.2  86.8  8.7  5.4  42.1 \nRussian \nFederation  6.06  974  424.0  797.0  13.8  86.4  8.9  5.3  59.8 \nEU   2.63  643  261.0  547.0  8.0  73.6  7.9  6.6  69.8 \nCIS  5.78  857  372.5  789.2  12.9  85.8  8.6  5.2  56.9 \nMongolia      271.0  313.0  9.5  \u2014  2.1  4.5   90 \n     Public  17  584 \n     Total  23.4  663 \n \nCIS = Commonwealth of Independent States, EU = European Union, GDP = gross domestic product, Occ = \noccupancy, OP = outpatient, THE = total health expenditure. \nSources: WHO European database, 2004 and 2005; National Center for Health Development Health Indicators 2005. \n \n12.  Health  Financing.  Since the economic transition, Mongolia has been able to keep \npublic health spending at a higher level than in most other transition countries (around 4\u20134.5% \n                                                 \n1  National Center for Health Development. 2005.

The Mongolian Health System at a Crossroads: An Incomplete Transition to a Post-Semashko Model. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nof GDP, now about 5% in 2007). Health has accounted for some 10\u201312% of total government \nexpenditure. In 1994, Mongolia established a Health Insurance Fund (HIF), which contributes \n33%  to  overall  health  spending.  The  government  budget  contributes  about  57%  and  the \nremainder comprises out-of-pocket expenditures. Issues and problems concerning health care \nfinancing have been well documented from many sources and reviews are summarized below. \n \n13.  Efficiency  considerations  include  (i)  fragmented  financing  and  inefficient  financial \narrangements (e.g., hospital funding from different sources, including the HIF and government); \n(ii) variable and line item budgeting practices that have still to reviewed in line with the Public \nSector  Finance  Management  Law  of  2003;  (iii)  funding  not  linked  to  performance  or  cost \ncontainment (as payment is based on beds, occupancy, and number of outpatient visits, there \nare  perverse  incentives  to  increase  beds,  unnecessary  admissions,  and  visits;  (iv)  HIF\u2019s \ncovering mainly inpatient services and favoring expensive and larger hospitals over smaller and \nrural hospitals; (v) weak resource allocation mechanisms from lack of government cost based \ninformation across the system; and (vi) surpluses not invested back into the system. \n \n14.  Equity considerations include much of the population\u2019s not receiving care due to lack of \nhealth insurance coverage, limited spending on PHC, informal payments (40% of patients now \npay informally), and co-payments acting as a barrier to access by poor people.  \n \n15.  Quality considerations include low investment in technology and improved services (one \nreason why increasing numbers are seeking care outside of the country); low remuneration \nleading  to  poor  care;  inability  to  use  efficiency  savings,  resulting  in  lack  of  incentives  for \nmangers to make improvement changes; and automatic reimbursement irrespective of quality. \n \n16.  The Government has flagged some important areas to be covered in future financing \npolicies, including (i) equity directions (state to fund 75% of health care, universal compulsory \ncoverage of HIF, 100% state funding of PHC, global budgeting for essential services based on \ncase mix, and regulatory incentives for providers); (ii) efficiency directions (single purchaser \nmodel; regulations for purchasers; semiautonomous hospitals; output based budgeting; case \nmix and global budgets; improved organizational delivery systems to provide more efficient \ncare, such as day only and home care; and contracting out); and (iii) quality directions (standard \ncosts developed from use of protocols and guidelines; per capita based funding; performance \nincentives and contracts for quality; and accreditation linked to financial incentives). \n \n17.  Planning and Regulation. At the central level, the Ministry of Health (MOH) sets the \nhealth policy agenda and prepares long- and medium-term plans and budget proposals while \nmonitoring implementation at the central, capital city, and aimag levels. The Ministry of Finance \ndetermines  the  total  budget  to  be  allocated  to  the  health  sector.  Decisions  on  financial \nallocations are made primarily on the basis of historical expenditure; norms and standards in the \nsector; plus government resolutions, decrees, and national health programmes related to the \npriority areas identified. The HIF is regulated through the State Social Insurance General Office \n(SSIGO). While there are organizational structures and formal mechanisms for coordinating \npolicies between MOH and SSIGO, there is little or no coordination of service purchasing \npolicies between HIF and MOH. \n \n18.  Human Resources Development. Human resources (HR) have been a major concern \nin the health sector since the economic transition. Key problem areas include (i) demonstrated \noverstaffing of doctors; (ii) low ratios of nurses to doctors and other inefficient skills mixes; (iii) \nmisdistribution of key personnel, with critical lack of staff in rural areas; and (iv) low salaries and \nincentives for health workers. \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.5: Ratios of Nurses and Doctors \n \nNurses per 1,000  Doctors per 1,000  Nurse-Doctor \nCountry  Population  Population  Ratio \nCambodia  0.61  0.16  3.81 \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  1.05  1.06  0.99 \nJapan  7.79  1.98  3.93 \nKorea, Republic of   1.75  1.57  1.11 \nMalaysia  1.35  0.7  1.93 \nPhilippines  1.69  0.58  2.91 \nSingapore  4.24  1.4  3.03 \nViet Nam  0.56  0.53  1.06 \nMongolia  3.13  2.63  1.19 \n \nSource: World Health Organization. 2005. World Health Report 2005. Geneva. \n \n19.  HR management and processes are still weak in Mongolia, characterized by poorly \ndeveloped  recruitment  and  selection,  performance  review,  staff  support,  and  career \ndevelopment, as well as little supporting data. Career pathways and incentive packages are \nrudimentary, and salaries and working conditions for staff in rural areas are insufficient to \nmotivate movement to the countryside. Other evident long-standing problems include too many \nnew doctors being trained, as well as clinical training programs that are not linked with future \nspecialist needs or guided by clinical curricula. \n \n20.  The  suboptimal  HR  situation  has  led  to  deterioration  in  health  service  quality  and \navailability of services, failure to meet population health needs, and lack of confidence in the \nhealth  care  system.  A  multisectoral  High  Level  HR  Coordinating  Committee  has  been \nestablished to coordinate development and implementation of HR policies and strategies in the \nhealth  sector.  Major  international  agencies,  including  Asian  Development  Bank,  and  the \nGovernment have committed to improving health care HR in Mongolia. \n \n21.  The  Health  Sector  Master  Plan.  To assist in establishing a systemic approach, a \nHealth Sector Master Plan (HSMP), has been developed and approved by the Government for \nthe  period  2006\u20132015.  The  HSMP  serves  as  a  technical  long-term  planning  document  to \naddress major strategic directions in Mongolian health care.  \n \nB.  Current Issues and Concerns in the Mongolian Health Sector \n \n22.  Overextensive Hospital System. The need to restructure hospital services in Mongolia \nis well documented. With a large number of hospitals (mostly in Ulaanbaatar), 14,600 public \nsector hospital beds (in 2005), and 6,448 doctors for a population of 2.5 million people, there \nare  simply  too  many  hospitals,  excess  hospital  beds,  and  overstaffing  of  hospitals.  Public \nhospital facilities and services in Ulaanbaatar include 16 clinical and tertiary hospitals and \ncenters and some 46 hospitals of various types, in a city of around 900,000. In addition to \nsurplus capacity and staff, shortcomings include inappropriate hospital admissions and clinical \npractices,  poor  distribution  of  limited  technology,  fragmentation  of  funding  sources  and \nadministrative services, limited use of information, and rigid planning and budgeting.  \n \n23.  Perverse  payment  incentives  encourage  inefficient  use  of  in-patient  services,  and \nhospital stays, at an average of 9\u201311 days, are unnecessarily long. The hospital sector still \nabsorbs most of government investment. There is also a large and growing private sector of \nsmall hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies. The hospital sector overall has grown \nsignificantly over the last few years, which has increased the number of beds, admissions, \npersonnel, and costs. Various reviews have pointed to the need for administrative rationalization \n(or optimization) of the hospital sector, and particularly in Ulaanbaatar. This should include \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nmerging and closing of small specialist hospitals; reducing duplication of services; reorganizing \nservices and hospitals based on defined population needs, and alignment of clinical services. It \nhas been estimated that 7\u201310 hospitals could adequately and efficiently serve Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \npopulation along with rural referrals. Savings from increasing the efficiency of the hospital sector \ncould be used to fund investments in public health and PHC. Potential savings from optimization \nare estimated at MNT1 billion\u2013MNT3 billion annually.3   \n \n24.  Growth of the Private Health Sector. In Mongolia, the opening of the market economy \nhas encouraged significant growth in the private health sector. Government policy enables \nprivate hospitals to compete with the public sector, and HIF funding allows private hospitals to \nreceive reimbursement for patients under public subsidy. In principle, private health care can \ndeliver quality and efficiency to the health sector, contribute to meeting health system goals, and \ncomplement public provision in an integrated fashion. However, in Mongolia the private sector is \npractically unregulated and has been growing very rapidly. There are no standards to determine \nquality of service and patient safety; no definitions or criteria for defining the scope of clinical \nservices; and no standards for premises, infrastructure, or equipment. Many private hospitals \nconsist of only 4\u20138 beds and have no insurance.  \n \n25.  A functioning institutional and regulatory environment is needed in Mongolia to facilitate \nthe appropriate involvement of the private sector in the planned and strategic delivery of health \nservices. Mongolia needs policies for private sector development, accreditation of hospitals and \nfacilities, and regulatory mechanisms to monitor performance and ensure safety and quality of \ncare. \n \n26.  Inadequate Support for PHC. Despite emphasizing the importance of PHC in various \nlaws, regulations, and policies, support for public health and for the most significant element of \nPHC  development  in  Mongolia,  the  FGP  system,  has  been  inconsistent.  Since  the  initial \nestablishment of FGPs in 1999\u20132001, the situation for family doctors has deteriorated, with \nseverely constrained funding resulting in low and decreasing doctor and nurse incomes, as well \nas a lack of investment in infrastructure, premises, and equipment. Moreover, there are unclear \nlegal and regulatory processes that disadvantage doctors\u2019 status and social standing.  \n \n27.  Lack of Governance, Monitoring, and Regulation. A principal reason for many of the \nhealth  system  problems  is  weakness  in  governance  and  regulation.  Government  and  its \nagencies have paid insufficient attention to monitoring, direction and guidance, as evidenced by \nthe uncontrolled growth of the private sector; lack of a legal basis for FGPs; lack of application \nof routine administrative, financial and clinical data; and, until the recent initiation of  the Master \nPlan process, lack of overall strategic direction. \n \nC.  Conclusions  \n \n28.  In  the  transition  from  a  Soviet-based  health system  towards  a  mixed  public-private \nmodel focusing on PHC with coordinated secondary and tertiary services, Mongolia has had \nonly uneven success to date. Overall, health outcomes and indicators are improving, but in the \nhealth system generally there are significant problems of poor quality of care, inefficiency, and \ninadequate implementation of reform and improvement strategies. The HSMP, with its sector-\nwide approach, provides a sound basis to make progress on these and other issues. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2006. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE HEALTH SECTOR IN MONGOLIA \n \n  Total Value of     \nFunding   Projects  Period of   \nAgency  ($ million)  Implementation  Description \nA.

The Project has a strong focus on rural health development to improve population health \noutcomes. Project aimags were selected based on objective criteria, including population health \nstatus and morbidity, infrastructure status, poverty levels, commitment of local authorities, and \nprevious low levels of investment. Each criterion was ranked and scaled individually and a \nweighted aggregate score derived for each aimag. Aimags for each phase of the Project are set \nout below. The combined population of the five aimags and two duuregs is 688,660 or 26.8% of \nthe total population. Overall, 40% of the covered aimag population is poor.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Mongolia: \nPoverty and health are strongly related, and better health services are not only a social goal but also a prerequisite to \neconomic development. Improved health care expands economic opportunities for people, including the poor and \ndisadvantaged, by building human capital, as expressed in good health, well-being and capacity for work. Healthy \npeople actively engage in economic activities, thus increasing productivity. Reliable health services reduce such \nlifecycle risks to the individual as illness, injury, disability, and early death, thereby also preventing impoverishment.  \n \nImproving health services and the health status of the population will reduce government as well as household \nexpenditure. Mongolia\u2019s extensive system of social safety nets costs about 7% of gross domestic product per year, of \nwhich 40% is devoted to social assistance for the poor and the disadvantaged. Maintaining and improving social \nservice delivery prevents new incidences of poverty that are caused by poor health and educational deprivation.   \n \nIn Mongolia, access and quality of social services is both a push and a pull factor in current migration. Rural people \nwith few adequate skills and experience living in settled areas face problems in coping with urban life. Moreover, they \nhave limited support networks and few income earning opportunities. Therefore, the risk of falling into poverty is high. \nImproving health services in rural and peri-urban areas will significantly slow migration and reduce poverty.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to achieving Mongolia\u2019s Millennium Development Goals, particularly goals 4, 5, and 6 and \ntargets 5, 6, 7, and 8 to (i) reduce by two thirds the under-five mortality rate, (ii) reduce by three quarters the maternal \nmortality rate, (iii) halt by 2015 and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, and (iv) halt by 2015 and begin to \nreverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAccording to the HIE/LSM 2002/03 survey,1 around 900,000, or 36%, of Mongolians live in poverty.2 Poverty is higher \nin rural areas than in urban areas (43% versus 30%). The so-called poverty gap stands at 11% and estimates the \naverage shortfall in consumption relative to the poverty line. This figure implies that the per person cost of eliminating \npoverty is 11% of the poverty line. \n \nIn contrast to the head count or to the poverty gap, the severity of poverty is 4.7%. Both, the poverty gap and severity \nare higher in rural than in urban areas. At the regional level, the West is the poorest region. The poverty incidence in \nthe West represents more than half of the population. This figure is almost two fifths in the Highland region and \naround one third in both the Central and East regions.  \n \nUlaanbaatar displays the country\u2019s lowest level of poverty, and slightly more than one quarter of its residents are poor. \nFollowing the capital city by poverty measures are the aimag (provincial) centers and then rural areas. \n \nHealth challenges in Mongolia include maternal mortality rates, a high incidence of tuberculosis, and poor quality of \npublic health care services. Over the last 10 years, Mongolia has achieved certain progress in reducing infant \nmortality and mortality of children under 5 years of age. A 2003 survey established that the causes of maternal \nmortality are associated with decreasing level and quality of medical services (36%), delay in emergency medical aid \n(28%), and living far from medical institutions. \n \nChild and maternal mortality are directly linked to poverty. Infants and undernourished pregnant women from poor \nfamilies are much more likely to die or suffer complications than are well-nourished mothers and their offspring.3 The \ninfant mortality rate per 1,000 live births has fallen from 31.23 in 2000 to 20.8 in 2005. The under-5 child mortality rate \nhas also decreased from 42.4 to 26.1. The rural-urban gap remains substantial, however, as those figures are 18.1 \nand 21.7, respectively, in urban areas but 22.5 and 28.9 in rural areas.

Gobi-Altai is among the five aimags with the highest infant mortality rates.   \n \nThe maternal mortality rate steadily decreased to 93.0 per 100,000 live births in 2005 from its highest level of 161 \nduring 1996\u20131998.4 In the same period, this measure\u2019s rural-urban gap narrowed from 2 to 1.4 times. In 2005, 13.8% \nof pregnant women had chronic anemia, significantly lower than the 40% in 2000. Almost half (54.2%) of maternal \nmortality occurs among herdswomen and 30.8% among housewives. Although home delivery has decreased since \n2000, professionally unassisted delivery is increasing in Ulaanbaatar. That is apparently due to the high rate of \nmigration without residence registration. Primary causes of mortality are diseases not related to pregnancy (33%), \nfollowed by complications post-delivery (26%) and during pregnancy (24%).5 The Reproductive Health-2003 survey \nreveals that only 4% of adolescent girls use contraceptives and, as a result, over half (53.6%) of abortions were first-\ntime pregnancies.   \n \nDue in part to persistent poverty and crowded family living conditions, the incidence of tuberculosis is consistently \nrising (from 8 per 10,000 of population in 1990 to 17.2 in 2005) in both rural and urban areas. The highest rates are in \nDarkhan-Uul, Dornod, and Ulaanbaatar. In 2005, it was the third most common infectious disease (13.6%), preceded \nby sexually transmitted diseases (17.4%) and viral hepatitis (19.7%). Syphilis and gonorrhea are growing concerns, \nhaving increased by more than 2.5 times since 1991. There are 30 cases of individuals diagnosed HIV positive and \nfour cases of death from AIDS. \n \nPoor people tend to be more affected by infectious diseases. Mongolia is one of seven Asia-Pacific countries cited by \nWorld Health Organization as having high incidence of tuberculosis. Most people with tuberculosis are unemployed \nand either poor or extremely poor. There are also male health concerns, such as a comparatively high incidence of \nstroke and heart disease from age 40 onwards. This appears to be linked to poor diet, high levels of tobacco use, and \nalcohol abuse. According to HIE/LSM 2002/03 survey, health spending averages 5% of household consumption for \nthe population as a whole. For poor households, that figure averages 4.5% and for non-poor households it is 5.4%. \nBecause of their inability to pay for the services in cash, medical services consumption of the poor is quite low. The \nincidences  of  major  diseases  causing  morbidity  and  mortality  are  increasing  among  rural  populations.  This \ndemonstrates that the quality and availability of medical services in rural areas is poor and inadequate.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented in five rural aimags (Arkhangai, Dundgovi, Govi-Altai, Sukhbaatar, and Tuv) and two \nduuregs of Ulaanbaatar (Chingeltei and Songinokhairkhan) benefiting client population or more than 700,000. About \n40.4% of the population in the project aimags is poor, compared to the national average of 36%. Overall, the Project \naims to improve and extend primary health care (PHC) services to benefit the Mongolian population, in particular, the \nrural poor, the urban underserved, women, children, and the elderly.                                                                                 \n \nC.

Four \nstakeholder groups were identified and consulted across a range of issues. Primary stakeholders included service \nusers and service providers at the bag (village), soum (district), and aimag levels, and in Ulaanbaatar. About 127 \nbeneficiaries from Songinokhairkhan district, Baruun-Urt (aimag center) and Dariganga soums of Sukhbaatar aimag \nparticipated in the consultation process by assessing the coverage and quality of primary health care. \n \nParticular emphasis was given to consulting with the poor and women\u2019s groups in the communities in order to \nunderstand their needs and demands of health services. Secondary stakeholders consisted of national and local \npolicy and decision makers. Consultation discussions indicated a range of health and social concerns in the \ncommunity, but the focus was strongest on the need for increased collaboration between the communities, local \ninstitutions, and local authorities for improving access and quality of PHC.  \n \nGreater  involvement  of  stakeholders  on  promoting  health  is  ensured  by  introducing  community  involvement \nmechanisms, such as the following: (i) hospital boards will be established with community members, representatives \nof nongovernment organization, and others, (ii) local social workers and health volunteers will play a significant role in \nlinking the very poor and families with soum doctors, and (iii) health-promoting organizations will enhance cooperation \nbetween institutions and the community. The Project aims to shift people\u2019s attitudes from curative to preventive care, \nwhich requires greater involvement of individuals and community organizations. The Project  will  also (i) undertake \noutreach, health promotion, public health, surveillance, and primary care training programs for soum hospital staff and \nrural and urban family group practices; (ii) raise awareness among the population, health workers, and policymakers \non the extent and effects of catastrophic payments; and (iii) develop and implement in project areas participatory \nmechanisms and processes for increased community involvement, including complaints procedures, public reporting, \nand advisory bodies. \n                                                 \n4  National Center for Health Development. 2005.

Health status of the population in the country is highly differentiated by gender. Male \nadult mortality is nearly double that of females. On the other hand, as women comprise the \nmajorities  of  the  health  care  system\u2019s  users  and  providers,  they  will  be  the  major  direct \nbeneficiaries of the Third Health Sector Development Project. There is potential to maximize the \nproject impact on the health status of the poor, women, and other disadvantaged groups, \nhowever, by emphasizing the pro-poor orientation of primary health care (PHC). The main \nstrategy of the Project is to strengthen public health education, health promotion, and the \nprevention  aspects  of  PHC,  thus  taking  another  step  towards  a  more  efficient  preventive \napproach. The Government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan also acknowledges that the goal of \nimproving the health status and lifestyles of Mongolians cannot be achieved by efforts purely in \nthe  health  sector.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  undertake  strategies  to  improve  intersectoral \ncollaboration  and  coordination  (between  local  governments,  national-level  health  program \ncommittees and boards, the professional inspection agency, educational institutions, water and \nsanitation services, police, nongovernment organizations including women\u2019s groups, schools, \nand other community groups) in order to mobilize local initiatives, responsibility, and ownership. \n \nB.  Program Design \n \n2.  The proposed project has design features that promote gender equity in the health \nsector  that  can  contribute  to  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  and  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \ncommon goal of poverty alleviation.  \n \n3.  The Project will implement a gender plan that will create opportunities and facilitate \naccess to health services for men and women. It will address gender concerns in the four \ncomponents, namely: (i) providing quality and accessible health services, (ii) improving health \ncare financing and health insurance, (iii) enhancing human resource development, and (iv) \nsector capacity development and management. The gender plan will provide a framework to \nenhance women\u2019s active and equitable participation in Project\u2019s implementation and monitoring. \n \n4.  The Project will address the following gender concerns: \n \n(i)  Ensure the development of pro-poor and gender-sensitive information, education, \nand communication materials, as well as their further replication, adaptation, and \ndistribution  through  family  group  practices  (FGPs)  and  soum  health  centers \n(SHCs) in the country. \n(ii)  Incorporate  gender  in  health,  domestic  violence,  and  other  relevant  health \npromotion, education, and prevention modules in the in-service health training \n(for doctors, nurses, and feldshers). \n(iii)  Explore  adoption  of  a  requirement  for  reporting  registration  of  incidents  of \ndomestic violence among women and children. \n(iv)  Explicitly  target  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  needs  for  health-seeking  behavior  and \nhealthy lifestyles by improving outreach to such disadvantaged groups as single-\nheaded  households,  the  elderly,  the  disabled,  temporary  residents,  and \nnonresidents.  \n(v)  Increase the number of poor, disadvantaged, and disabled men and women who \nare insured. \n ", "    Appendix 13      51     \n(vi)  Improve  monitoring  and  reporting  of  household  expenditures,  out-of-pocket \npayments, and utilization of FGPs and SHCs (with data disaggregated by gender \nof household head). \n(vii)  Support  gender  awareness  raising  for  human  resource  development  and \nadvocacy for gender-sensitive human resource policies in the Ministry of Health. \n(viii)  Improve gender analysis capacity of relevant management. \n(ix)  Institutionalize collection, analysis, and evidence extraction for policy making of \nhealth sector data, disaggregated by gender and poverty level. \n \n5.  A detailed gender plan including monitoring indicators and agencies responsible for \nimplementing and monitoring the gender plan is presented in Table A13. The gender analysis of \nthe Project is set out in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n6.  The implementation of the gender plan follows the implementation arrangements for the \nProject. The project implementation unit (PIU) will have a project manager and five staff for \nplanning and human resources, administration and finance, civil works, secretarial services, and \na driver. At the aimag level, there will be an aimag project coordinator assisted by staff for \ntraining, quality, and civil works. Project activities in the capital city will be managed by the PIU. \nThe Project will deploy a part time (10 person-months in total) gender specialist in the PIU over \nthe duration of the Project. The gender specialist will ensure implementation of the gender plan \nand will be responsible for gender analysis and aspects of data; adopted policies; standards and \nguidelines; gender sensitivity in advocacy and awareness rising within the MOH and PIU; \ninformation,  education,  and  communication;  resource  materials;  and  health  professionals \ntraining.

Introduction \n \n1.  The economic analysis was undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Health Sector Projects.1 The analysis covers the review of the project economic \ncontribution to the health system and effects of the Project on the beneficiaries and long-term \nfiscal position of the Ministry of Health (MOH).  \n \nB.  Economic Parameters and Assumptions \n \n2.  The economic analysis of the Project was conducted over 20 years, inclusive, of project \nconstruction. Project construction will commence in 2009 and be completed in 2013. Economic \nbenefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and expressed \nin constant 2007 prices. International costs were converted to local currency costs using an \nexchange  rate  that  started  at  MNT1,200  per  $1.  Tradable  components  were  adjusted  to \neconomic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.017, and nontraded components \nwere valued at domestic market prices.2 Shadow wage rate factors of 1.2 and 0.8 were applied \nto the wages of skilled and unskilled labor, respectively, at the domestic price level. \n \n3.  Base costs plus physical contingencies were estimated and apportioned on the basis of \ntradable,  nontradable,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  costs.  Similarly,  operation  and \nmaintenance costs for each subproject were estimated on the basis of skilled and unskilled \nlabor valued in economic prices (i.e., using shadow wage rate factors). \n  \nC.  Economic Benefit Assumptions \n \n4.  The Project supports the Mongolian health system\u2019s efforts to improve the health status \nof the population. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were derived for the Project. The \nmain benefits quantified were resource cost savings and productivity gains. Resource cost \nsavings consist of reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care as a result of reforms in \nhealth financing. Productivity gains are the results of less time lost to illness that would have \notherwise been utilized in some economic activity. Productivity gains are also realized when \nless time is spent for the care of sick family members, as well as better learning outcomes of \nchildren  who  will  eventually  join  the  labor  force.3 Direct  and  indirect  health  benefits  are \nsignificant due to fewer days lost at work and school and a general increase in the overall \nquality of life. The analysis does not attempt to quantify all economic gains and only provides \nconservative estimates based on benefit streams that can be quantified. \n \nD.  Quantification of Economic Benefits \n \n5.  Cost Savings. These are the annual benefits expected as a result of savings from \naverage out-of-pocket expenses expected to be incurred had the patient been treated at a \nprivate  hospital  rather  than  at  a  public  health  center.  Benefits  are  calculated  based  on \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2000. Handbook for the Economic \nAnalysis of Health Sector Projects. Manila. \n2  Since the shadow exchange rate factor is so close to unity, it does not appear that project costing, which is \npresently at a preliminary stage, is very sensitive to shadow exchange rates. This assessment is supported by the \nfact that the difference between the official exchange rate and the \u201cstreet rate\u201d over the past year has been an \naverage of only 3%. \n3  ADB Economics and Research Department. 2003. Technical Note No. 6. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 14          55 \nMNT120,000  annual  incremental  costs  that  a  patient  will  incur  to  go  to  a  private  facility, \nassuming two4 visits a year. The base case assumes that out-of-pocket spending on health care \nis reduced from MNT120,000 per year to MNT108,000 per year in the target aimag (savings of \nMNT12,000 per person per year). Given the low level of household income of the poor in \nMongolia,  this  represents  a  significant  savings  for  many  households.  In  the  calculation  of \nbenefits, the target population in the five aimags (provinces) and two duuregs (districts) in \nUlaanbaatar were used to calculate the number of patients that will benefit from the Project. The \nannual number of patients that will incur cost savings is based on the difference between the \nhealth incidence with and without the Project. \n \n6.  Productivity. Improving the health status of the population will lead to fewer days lost \ndue to illness and fewer days needed to take care of ill relatives than without the health \ninterventions  introduced  by  the  Project.  Time  is  valued  at  MNT4,133  per  day  based  on \nprevailing wages.5 This value of time is assumed to be constant for the entire population. The \neconomically active population that will require hospital care is assumed to be 60%.6  The base \ncase assumes that an average of 2 days per year will be gained per capita due to more efficient \ntreatment and better availability of services. At the prevailing wage of MNT4,133 per day, the \nmonetary value of the productivity gain is MNT8,265 per person.    \n \nE.  Economic Cost Assumptions \n \n7.  Economic costs were calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements and \nincremental recurrent costs. It is assumed that for each MNT spent on investment an additional \nMNT0.10 per year is spent on operation and maintenance of the new health facilities. The cost \nof administering the Project (including the cost to MOH of administering the grant, the cost of \nconsultants, and monitoring and evaluation of the Project) are also included as a component of \nthe recurrent cost.  \n \nF.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n8.  The basic rates of return for the Project are shown in Table A14. The Project yields an \neconomic internal rate of return of 22.8% and a net present value of MNT11.3 billion. The net \npresent  value  calculation  discounts  the  cost  and  benefit  streams  at  12%  in  real  terms. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  sensitivity  of  the  Project  to  less  optimistic \nassumptions. The \u201cless cost savings\u201d scenario assumes that the Project is not successful in \nreducing  out-of-pocket  expenses.  The  \u201cfewer  sick  days  saved\u201d  scenario  assumes  that  the \nProject does not reduce the number of sick days lost due to illness and the \u201clow participation\u201d \nscenario assumes that the uptake of the Project is slower than expected. The low case scenario \ncombines \u201cless cost savings\u201d and \u201clower productivity\u201d from lives saved. Even with the most \npessimistic assumptions, the Project has a positive rate of return of 17.1%. In general, these \nfactors are not enough to overturn the judgment that the Project is socially beneficial.  \n                                                 \n4  The average number of visits per person per year over the past 3 years is 2.5, according to the National Center for \nHealth Development, Ministry of Health. 2005. 2005 Health Indicators.

Financial Sustainability \n \n9.  One of the goals of the Project is to increase efficiency of health care spending and \nimprove internal efficiency of health service delivery, thus reducing the cost of health care for \nthe individual and society. The incremental recurrent costs of the Project arise largely from \nincreased access to quality health care. \n  \n10.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  evaluates  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \ngovernment budget. The total financing cost of the Project, inclusive of taxes, duties, and \ncontingencies, is $17.6 million for around 5 years. The Government\u2019s annual share in project \ncosts will average around $719,000 equivalent (MNT863 million), or less than 1% of the health \nsector projected annual budget of about $87.2 million. The recurrent costs to be borne by the \nGovernment during the implementation of the Project are estimated to be about $107,000 \nequivalent  (MNT128  million)  per  year  and  include  the  operating  expenses  of  the  project \nimplementation unit; as well as operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of new and \nupgraded health facilities and equipment. The family group practices under the Project will \ncontinue to be funded by the Government during and after the Project\u2019s implementation. The \nbudgetary impact of the estimated annual recurrent costs during implementation of the Project is \nconsidered  minimal.  The  local  government  units  will  share  in  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance of the rehabilitated soum hospitals. The Government is committed to provide the \nnecessary funds to ensure that the benefits of the investment are not lost. It was concluded that \nthere was a capacity and willingness in the Government to allocate budgetary resources to the \nhealth sector and the proposed project. \n     \nH.  Financial Management Assessment  \n \n11.  A financial management assessment of MOH has been undertaken using the financial \nmanagement  assessment  questionnaire  provided  by  ADB.  The  completed  questionnaire  is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix G. It determines the accounting and financial capacity \nneeds  of  MOH  during  project  implementation  and  operations  after  completion.  The \nquestionnaire was administered to the finance department of MOH. The assessment of MOH\u2019s \nprevious experience of managing ADB loan projects confirms that its financial management \npractices are fully adequate for the implementation of the Project.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 15         57 \nSYNOPSIS OF THE SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION  \n \nA.   Introduction  \n \n1.  According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) procedures for environmental and social \nreview of projects, the Third Health Sector Development Project is in environmental category B. \nA limited number of specific environmental impacts may result from project implementation but \ncan  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  generally  recognized  performance  standards, \nguidelines, or design criteria. The following potential environmental, health, and safety impacts \nwere analyzed: (i) comprehensive waste management plan, including medical waste handling \nand disposal; (ii) liquid waste and sewage disposal; (iii) management of construction impacts \nover the planned building period (sediment and erosion control, emissions, noise, traffic, worker \nhealth and safety); (iv) hygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices; \nand (v) employee health and safety training. The summary initial environmental examination is \nin Supplementary Appendix L. \n   \nB.   Description of the Project  \n \n2.  The Project impact is to improve Mongolians\u2019 health status and lifestyle. The Project has \nfour components: (i) strengthened health service, (ii) strengthened health sector financing and \nhealth  insurance,  (iii)  improved  human  resource  capacity  in  the  health  sector,  and  (iv) \nstrengthened  sector  capacity  development  and  management.  The  project  rationale  is  to \ncontinue  policy  reforms  advanced  under  previous  health  sector  development  initiatives: \nexpanding and improving primary health care, improving financial expenditure for increased \nsystem  efficiency,  expanding  health  insurance  coverage,  and  improving  human  resource \ncapacity.  Component  1  contains  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  health  facilities  as \nindicated in Table A15.1.  \n \nTable A15.1: Project Components and Elements \n \n    Rehabilitation of   \n  New Construction   Existing Hospitals   \n  Clean Water \nInter-soum  Soum Health  Family   \nProject Aimag   Sources for \nHealth Centers  Centers  Group   \nor District  (20 beds)  (10 beds)  Practices  Soum Health Center  Hospitals \nArkhangai       4  1  1   \nDundgobi      2      12 \nGobi-Altai  1    2    1    9 \nSukhbaatar      3    1   \nTuv      3  1  1   \nTotal  1  14  2  4  20 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.   Description of the Environment  \n \n3.  Climate and Geography. The climate of the project areas is continental, with very hot, \ndry summers and long, cold winters. The geographical areas in which the project sites are \nlocated are characterized by open landscapes in Dundgobi, Gobi-Altai, and Sukhbaatar with \nminimal vegetation and steppe. In mountain locations of Arkhangai and Tuv aimags (provinces) \nin the central and northern part of country, there is more forest vegetation. Due to different \nclimatic zones, the annual precipitation varies between 400 millimeters in Arkhangai and Tuv \nand 120\u2013200 millimeters in Dundgobi and Gobi-Altai. The dominant physical environment is \nconsidered  moderate  to  harsh.  Summer  and  winter  temperatures  vary  significantly,  due \nprimarily to differences in elevation (720\u20132,060 meters above sea level). The salient features of \nthe physical environment are given in Table A15.2. \n ", "58  Appendix 15           \nTable A15.2:  Matrix of Geographical and Meteorological Factors of Project Aimags \n \n \n      Annual  Air Temperature (0C)  Predominant Wind \n      Average \n         \n  Altitude   Latitude /  Precipitation \nHigh  Low  Mean  Velocity  Direction  \nAimag  (meters)  Longitude  (mm) \nArkhangai   1,900   N1060 / 460  E  400  + 23  - 32  18  4 m/s  NW \nDundgobi  1,400   N 1060 / 450 E  120  + 40  - 36  25  5 m/s  NW \nGobi-Altai  2,300   N 960 / 460 E  130  + 35  - 35  30  6 m/s  W,NW \nSukhbaatar  1,000   N 1130 / 460 E  150  + 40  - 37  32  5 m/s  N, NW \nTuv  1,950   N 1060 / 460 E  350   + 17  - 24  12  4 m/s  N, NW \nm/s = meters per second, E = east, mm = millimeter, N = north, NW = northwest, W = west. \nSource: Aimag Environment Report. 2002. Ulaanbaatar \n \n4.  Surface Water and Groundwater. The nearest surface water is located at least 20 \nkilometers away in the Tamir River, which is abundant and used to water livestock and irrigate \nvegetables. Surface water quality is acceptable. The city water supply system and solid waste \nmanagement have shifted to the private sector and is currently run by the Undrakh Company. \nThis company provides the hospital with good and abundant cold water for drinking, washing, \nand cooking 24 hours a day. No hot water is supplied, but the hospital provides it through an \ninstalled  small-scale  heating  system.  As  it  is  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country, \ngroundwater is sufficient, suitable, and used for drinking, washing, cooking, and irrigating.   \n \n5.  Environmentally Sensitive Areas and Hazards. No environmentally sensitive areas \nwere observed near the soum (district) health centers (SHCs).  \n \n6.  Air Quality. Outdoor and indoor air quality are satisfactory for the hospital and health \ncenters.  However,  at  times  airborne  particulates  lower  the  air  quality.  The  movement  of \nlivestock,  pedestrians,  and  vehicles,  as  well  as  strong  winds,  may  at  times  cause  slight \ndeterioration of indoor air quality, but not frequently or severely enough to cause concern.  \n \n7.  Vegetation.  Vegetation  around  the  hospital  and  health  centers  is  typically  in  poor \ncondition due to disturbance by grazing livestock and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. However, \nthe traffic in the vicinity of the hospital complex is low.  \n \n8.  Endangered Species, Wildlife, and Wildlife Habitat. There are no trees in the hospital \ncomplex. Aside from various domestic animals (dogs, sheep, horses, goats, and cows), wildlife \nin and around the hospital is limited to birds, small rodents, and common insects such as \ngrasshoppers and flies. The presence of endangered species is unlikely.  \n \nD.  Socioeconomic Description \n \n9.  Administratively  aimags  are  divided  into  soums  and  bags  (villages).  Each  aimag \npopulation is around 19,000 (Arkhnagai and Tuv) to 16,000 (Dundgobi and Gobi-Altai). The \ntypical soum has population of 3,000\u20134,000, of which 80% is herder community living away from \nthe soum center and 20% are living in the soum\u2019s center.  \n \n10.  Most households of communities in soum and aimag centers live on khashaa (individual \nplots) and only a small percent of the population live in apartments connected with a central \nwater network and wastewater system. The majority of plots have a ger (traditional tent) and \nsome have wood and mud or brick houses. The average plot is about 787 square meters and \nthe average permanent house is about 59 square meters. Wood is the primary building material. \nGers are typically 6 meters in diameter.   \n \n11.  Ger areas\u2019 access to electricity supplies are relatively positive and sustainable in all \naimags. For heating and cooking, some 95% of households use a simple stove burning primarily \nwood and about 20\u201380% of households supplement their wood supply with coal. According to \n ", "  Appendix 15         59 \nhealth statistics, respiratory disease occurrence is predominant among children of 0\u201314 years of \nage and is mainly related to air pollution. \n \n12.  The main source of income varies as herders generate their income from sale of dairy \nproducts and such other materials as wool, cashmere, and meat. People in soum and aimag \ncenters mainly work for government organizations and the private sector. \n \n13.  Aimag General Hospital. Solid waste collection and disposal are provided by the town \nauthority, but the hospital is responsible for the collection and disposal of its medical waste. This \nwaste is disposed of on the hospital premises by burning in a locally constructed incinerator. \n \n14.  Soum Health Center. Most facilities under the Project have similar problems, such as \nleaking roofs, structural cracking, limited electrical supplies, inefficient or nonoperating heating \nsystems, poor energy efficient design, no reticulated water supplies, pit latrines for sewerage \ndisposal, and unsatisfactory methods for disposing of clinical waste. Many buildings are more \nthan 30 years old and have had little or no maintenance due to a lack of financial resources. \nExtreme weather conditions exacerbate the condition of the buildings. \n \n15.  Medical  wastes  were  normally  burned  in  a  simple  metal  drum  or  handmade  stove \nwithout proper filters. Thus, it has some visual impact and release of some toxic gas. A local \ndoctor interviewed reported that a typical SHC (serving 3,000-4,000 people) generates 3\u20135 \nkilograms of waste (200\u2013250 syringes, 30\u201340 plastic drip containers, and 100 gloves) per day. \n \nE.   Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n \n1.  Construction Phase \n \n16.  Adverse environmental impacts due to civil works will be minimal, of short duration, and \nmitigated  by  design  and  construction  project  management.  There  may  be  relocation  and \nremoval of  existing trees and plants during construction, mainly due to building the water \ndistribution  systems,  but  trees  around  selected  SHCs  and  family  group  practices  will  be \nreplanted  and  other  vegetation  restored.  Some  areas,  like  Tariat  soum,  Arkhangai,  have \npermafrost. These factors should be considered during building design and construction.  \n \n17.  To enhance energy efficiency, building standards will be applied to ensure that building \nseals are tight, making them resistant to leaks. The amount of heat required will be drastically \nreduced  by,  for  example,  insulating  foundations,  and  using  extruded  rigid  polyurethane \ninsulation, rigid insulation for roofs, and metal thermally glazed windows and external doors. \n \n2.  Operation Phase \n \n18.  SHCs will establish water use contracts with local governments. Raw water quality is \nmonitored by the aimag professional inspection agency together with the SHC doctor. Water \nquality will be measured against the national water quality standards. To prevent potentially \nharmful emissions from incinerators, emission stacks will be located downwind of buildings. The \nremaining ash and residues should be removed and transported and dumped in accordance \nwith established standards. The Project will establish water supply networks with septic sewage \nsystems and improve management of hazardous medical waste by building small incinerators \nwith capacity to burn at least 5\u201310 kilograms of waste. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 15           \nF.   Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan  \n \n19.  Government procedures require that the Project\u2019s Executing Agency apply to the local \naimag environmental department for advice and clearance on environmental matters. That \ndepartment will (i) review the proposed project at the screening stage to determine the category \nof  potential  environmental  impact;  (ii)  review  the  assessment,  including  the  associated \nenvironmental management and environmental protection plans; and (iii) coordinate with the \nlocal professional inspection department.   \n \n20.  The aimag environment department reviewed and approved the initial environmental \nexamination, including the environmental monitoring plan and impact mitigation measures.  \n \n21.  The  post-development  operations  phase  of  the  Project  is  monitored  by  the  aimag \nprofessional  inspection  department,  which  also  has  the  authority  to  require  suspension  of \nactivities if the conditions of environmental protection are not followed. The aimag professional \ninspection department has four main units, including the environment and safety office and the \nhealth  and  sanitation  office.  During  the  construction  period,  the  environment  and  safety \ninspectors will especially monitor use of such locally extracted resources as wood, water, and \nsand. In the operational period, health and sanitation inspectors will monitor SHC activities, \nincluding the operation of incinerators and water quality.     \n \nG.   Public Consultation and Disclosure  \n \n22.  In preparing the environmental examination, field visits and interviews were conducted \non 16\u201317 April 2007 among community members of selected project sites. Local stakeholders, \nincluding hospital directors, nurses, patients and family members of patients, were consulted. \nThe focuses of public consultation was to provide an introduction to the proposed project activity \nand assess the general attitude towards improving or building a new SHC, as well as the major \nenvironmental concerns of local affected people.  \n \n23.  All community members were positive about rehabilitating or building a new SHC and \nbelieved  that  the  improved  SHC  would  provide  better  primary  health  care.  The  main \nenvironmental concerns regarded noise and dust pollution during construction.  \n \nH.   Findings and Recommendations  \n24.  Based on screening of possible environmental consequences, it was determined that the \nProject\u2019s components will have no significant environmental impacts. The subprojects will not \nadversely affect natural resources and will greatly improve primary health care in rural areas. \n \n25.  Local collection of construction materials, such as wood, sand and other materials, will \nbe supervised and monitored by soum environment inspectors. Contractors must pay some fees \nunder the law on fees for use of natural resources adopted by parliament.  \n \n26.  A water use contract will be established between the SHC and local government office. \nThe quality of the water will be inspected by the aimag professional inspection department to \nensure that it meets the national standard for water.  \n \nI.   Conclusions  \n \n27.  It is concluded that the Project can be classified as category B for the purpose of \nenvironmental  impact.  It  will  thus  not  require  preparation  of  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071029095011+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "proposed asian development fund grant mongolia, third health sector development project, proposed adf grant mongolia, mongolian health status improvement project, mongolian sector capacity development, rrp: mon 41119", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071122083028+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Asian Development Fund Grant Mongolia: Third Health Sector Development Project"}}
