INTRODUCTION \n1.  In May 2010, the Asian Development Bank announced its Asia Solar Energy Initiative \n(ASEI) to catalyze about 3,000 megawatts of solar power-generation projects over the next \nthree years. ASEI\u2019s broad objectives are to keep Asia and the Pacific abreast of technological \ndevelopments in solar energy; identify and develop large-capacity solar projects; and design \nincentive  mechanisms  and  innovative  financing  mechanisms  for  rapid  diffusion  of  solar \ntechnology for power generation, both grid-connected systems as well as distributed stand-\nalone generation. The initiative comprises three pillars: (i) an international knowledge-sharing \nplatform, (ii) project development, and (iii) innovative financing. The first (knowledge-sharing \nplatform), named the Asia Solar Energy Forum (ASEF), will organize international workshops on \nsolar  energy,  track  solar  project  development,  and  assimilate  suitable  tools  for  appraising \nassociated project proposals. The first meeting of ASEF was held in Manila during 5-6 July \n2010. Over 250 delegates from over 34 countries participated. \n \n2.  Regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is currently being implemented \nfor this initiative.1 The TA\u2019s midterm report has concluded that a knowledge management gap \nexists for solar energy and smart grid2 development in Asia and the Pacific. Based on this \nidentified knowledge management gap, the report reinforces the view that ADB, in partnership \nwith  various  stakeholders,  developing  member  countries  (DMC)  governments,  donors, \ndevelopment partners, knowledge institutions, the private sector, and other stakeholders should \nhelp develop ASEF to mainstream solar energy and associated technologies in the region in a \ntimely manner. This proposed TA will help create the ASEF as well as organize its second \nmeeting in Tokyo in early December 2010.   \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Solar energy is regarded as one of the fastest-growing electricity technologies in recent \nyears. Improvements in technology, cost structure, enabling policies, and regulatory frameworks \nhave driven its spectacular growth in developed countries. Solar energy has great implications \nalso for DMCs in Asia and the Pacific because (i) economies of scale can reduce costs to make \nsolar energy competitive with conventional energy resources; (ii) some DMCs have greater \nsolar radiation, more rapidly growing electricity demand, and more availability of land than \ndeveloped countries; and, (iii) some DMCs have the potential to become global and regional \nmanufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment.  \n \n4.  Strategy  2020  outlines  the  following  priorities  for  the  institution:  (i)  realizing \nenvironmentally sustainable growth for Asia and the Pacific; (ii) expanding its promotion of, and \ninvestment in, sound environmental management, while simultaneously capitalizing on ADB's \noperational strengths, such as infrastructure development and finance; and (iii) responding to \nclimate change and supporting DMCs to move their economies onto low-carbon growth paths \nby expanding the use of clean energy.3 Further, its 2009 Energy Policy seeks to increase ADB's \nrole  in  renewable  energy  development  by  facilitating  wider  technology  deployment,  raising \nawareness, encouraging policy and regulatory incentives to endorse use of renewable energy, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2010.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n5.  This  regional  capacity  development  TA  will  contribute  to  an  understanding  by  all \nstakeholders  of  the  potential  for  solar  energy  in  the  region,  the  key  actions  required  to \naccelerate solar energy development, the institutional and business models for its development \nand deployment, and the mechanisms to promote technology transfer to DMCs and to enhance \nthe scope for cooperation on research and development.  \n \n6.  This initiative will cover (i) large-scale solar photovoltaic and concentrated solar power \nprojects;  (ii)  grid-connected  distributed  solar  photovoltaic  projects;  (iii)  off-grid  solar  power \ngeneration projects; (iv) stable grid development projects using load management and two-way \nmeters; and (v) associated technologies, such as lithium ion batteries, and plug-in electric \nvehicles. To mainstream such projects, a well-organized ASEF is critical, and it must involve \nDMC  governments,  the  private  sector,  research  and  development  agencies,  civil  society \norganizations, donors, and development partners.  \n \n7.  ASEF will be useful for DMC governments in promoting foreign direct investment by \ninternational private sector companies. It will facilitate technology transfer by matching domestic \nand foreign companies (e.g., manufacturers, developers, suppliers, and financiers); mobilize \nconcessional  funding  from  development  partners  and  developed  countries  to  structure \nfinancially viable projects; help optimize solar policy and regulatory framework to attract private \nsector enterprises to the fast growing market; and channel capacity development support from \ndeveloped countries and development partners. \n \n8.  The private sector will have access to DMC government policy makers, acquire the \nlatest information on DMC market development, develop consortia with foreign and domestic \nenterprises,  and  approach  development  partners  and  developed  country  governments  to \nprovide financial assistance and TA with which the bankable projects can be developed. The \nASEF will also be beneficial for ADB and its development partners in promoting regional and \nnational policy dialogue, tailoring lending and guaranteeing operations to DMCs and the private \nsector, developing effective TA to match the needs of DMCs and the private sector, and sharing \nbest practices. \n   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The expected impact will be inclusive and low-carbon growth in Asia and the Pacific \nthrough increasing environmentally sound energy security with solar energy and stable grid \ndevelopment. The expected outcome will be the promotion and use of solar energy and stable \ngrid development in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The proposed TA will comprise three components: (i) preparation, creation and initial  \noperation of ASEF, (ii) organization of the second meeting of the ASEF in Tokyo, and (iii) \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "3 \n \nidentification and structuring of pilot projects for mainstreaming solar power generation. The \noutputs for the proposed TA are as follows.  \n \n11.  Preparation, creation and initial operation of the ASEF. The participants at the first \nmeeting of the ASEF held in Manila unanimously endorsed the conversion of the ASEF into a \nnon-governmental,  not-for-profit,  organization.  This  TA  will  support  the  planning,  design, \ndevelopment, preparation, creation and operations of the ASEF for the first 2 years as an \nindependent,  nonprofit  organization  involving  ADB,  DMC  governments,  the  private  sector, \nresearch  and  development  agencies,  civil  society  organizations,  donors,  and  development \npartners. Once fully established, ASEF will have its own staff, some may be seconded from \nparticipating private sector companies and others funded by contributions from ASEF members. \n \n12.  ASEF will seek to add value to the ongoing work of various organizations and initiatives \nin terms of investment, optimizing implementation arrangements, achieving economies of scale, \nand developing unified approaches to solar energy policies and programs. Its recommended \nroles will be to  \n \n(i)  enhance communication among stakeholders; \n(ii)  develop  institutional  capacity  of  DMC  government  agencies  and  utilities  for \nutilizing  and  mainstreaming  solar  energy  and  associated  technologies  and \nproducts;  \n(iii)  identify pilot projects, conduct pre-feasibility studies and structure utility-scale \nsolar power generation and rooftop and/or off-grid projects; \n(iv)  help structure innovative financing for the pilot projects, by identifying possible \nconcessional financial resources; and \n(v)  assist in the transfer of technologies for enlarging the solar energy market. \n \n13.  Organization of the second meeting of the ASEF in Tokyo. With identified partners \nand  network  participants,  the  second  meeting  of  the  ASEF  will  be  hosted  by  ADB,  the \nInternational Energy Agency, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, and the \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization. It will follow up on the outcome of the first \nmeeting  of  the  ASEF  held  in  Manila  in  July  2010,  and  will  discuss  specific  measures  to \novercome barriers for bankable solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, and distributed \nrooftop solar power projects, and sustainable off-grid and mini-grid projects using batteries that \nsynergize electric vehicle development. The second meeting of the ASEF will also allow DMCs \nto promote foreign direct investment, the private sector to assess potential partnerships with \nforeign  technology  partners,  international  private  sector  project  developers  to  understand \npolicies and incentive packages in DMCs, donors to consider user friendly concessional finance \nfor  ensuring  commercial  viability  of  solar  energy  projects  and  to  explore  closer  donor \ncoordination, and stakeholders to fill the perception gap.     \n \n14.  Identification and structuring of pilot projects. Several solar energy project proposals \nwill be identified during the discussions in ASEF in consultation with ADB, DMC governments, \nand project developers. Innovative measures to lower project risks, buy down the initial high \ncapital costs, and make the projects bankable will be undertaken to support these projects. It is \nenvisaged that a common set of tools will be prepared that can be used selectively in different \nDMCs with appropriate policy and regulatory environments. In some cases, prefeasibility studies \nwill be supported in close cooperation with the project counterparts in DMCs. \n \n \n \n ", "4 \n \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $2,000,000 equivalent, which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility.5 The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA. The solar technology team under the \nEnergy Community of Practice will supervise the work of the consultants in close coordination \nwith  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  various  operational \ndepartments.  \n \n17.  Activities under this TA, including the preparation, creation and operation of ASEF and \nholding the second meeting, will require twenty two international person-months of consulting \nservices for the first two years. The international consulting team will include (i) the chief \nexecutive officer for ASEF; (ii) two technical specialists for operation and administration of ASEF; \nand (iii) a forum producer for the meetings of ASEF. Further, three national consultants will be \nengaged for five person-months each, for a total of fifteen person-months. Outline terms of \nreference for international and national consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  International  consultants  will  be  separately  recruited  as  individuals,  as  flexibility  is \nneeded in sourcing a broad range of specialists. ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance \nwith  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).6 In the medium to long term, \nASEF will continue its operation without ADB\u2019s TA support.  \n \n19.  Equipment  for  ASEF  will  be  procured  under  the  TA  funds  by  ADB  according  to \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility, to \nbe replenished on liquidation, will be used to disburse funds to cover its administrative and \noperating costs. The ASEF will be required to maintain operation and administration accounts \nand have these accounts audited annually and reported to ADB. To facilitate the timely flow of \nfunds and to reduce the administrative burden, the knowledge platform will be provided with a \nbudget for travel expenses under the advance payment facility to be liquidated monthly. \n \n20.  Activities funded by this proposed TA will start in a DMC only after ADB has received a \nwritten statement of no-objection from the government. The TA is expected to be implemented \nover 18 months, from August 2010 to January 2012.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n21.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \n                                                 \n5  Established by the Government of Japan, administered by ADB. \n6  ADB. 2008.
