INTRODUCTION \n1.  Recognizing  that  climate  change  is  a  major  threat  to  economic  development,  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam has made it a key priority to address the impacts of climate change. In \nDecember 2008, by Decision No 158/QD-TTg, the government approved the National Target \nProgram (NTP) to respond to climate change. The NTP1 mandated a comprehensive effort to \nassess  climate  change  impacts  on  sectors  and  provinces,  and  develop  action  plans.  The \ngovernment  has  identified  international  engagement  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  from \ndevelopment partners as crucial elements for the successful implementation of the NTP, and \nrequested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The proposed policy and advisory \nTA (PATA) will support two ministries, a province, and two cities in developing and/or instituting \naction plans for effective implementation of the NTP. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program, (CSP)2 \nfor 2007\u20132010 supports government efforts to achieve higher levels of pro-poor economic growth, \nfoster social equity and balanced development, and protect the environment. The mid-term review \nof the CSP3 recommended stronger emphasis on addressing climate change. The proposed TA \nthus directly supports this new imperative and is listed in the current country operations business \nplan (COBP, 2009\u20132010).4 The scope, expected impact, outcome, outputs, and implementation \narrangements were discussed and finalized during a reconnaissance mission in March 2010 and a \nTA fact-finding mission in May 2010.5 The TA will be financed by the Nordic Development Fund \nand administered by ADB. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA will be \nimplemented in line with related work that is either ongoing or being planned by ADB.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam is particularly vulnerable to climate change. A study by the Ministry of Natural \nResources and the Environment (MONRE) in June 2009 states that by the end of the 21st century, \nthe average temperature in the country is expected to rise by about 2.3 degrees Celsius, with \nincreasing rainfall during the wet season and less rainfall during the dry season. The sea level is \nexpected to rise 75 centimeters during the same time period compared with the average for 1980\u2013\n1999, with significant economic impacts on the population, mostly in the Mekong and Red river \ndeltas. Viet Nam\u2019s current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are low (a total of about 145 million \ntons of carbon dioxide equivalent, with nearly half coming from the energy sector). However, in the \ncoming decades, increased demand for energy and heavier reliance on coal for power generation \nare expected to increase the country\u2019s GHG emissions significantly.7  \n \n3.

See section D on implementation arrangements for further \ndetails.  \n7  International Energy Agency, 2009. World Energy Outlook. Paris: International Energy Agency.  \n8 The Danish Embassy has provided $40 million in technical assistance funds to MONRE for 2008\u20132013. The amount of \n$15 million will be used for energy efficiency initiatives by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and $23 million will be \nprovided to MONRE as budget support for climate change policy work, including support for two provinces (Ben Tre \nand Quang Nam) to develop action plans. The remainder of $2 million has been set aside for program management. \n9  AFD and JICA will provide a climate change program loan that will include broad-based policy and budgetary support, \nincluding for elements of the NTP. In 2010, AFD will provide \u20ac20 million and JICA will provide \u00a510 billion.  \n ", "2   \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)\u2014are  providing  support  to  MONRE  and  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development. However, the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) and the \nMinistry of Transport (MOT) have received limited support10 for implementation of the NTP, even \nthough they are the agencies responsible for sectors that are both significant contributors to GHG \nemissions and projected to be adversely affected by climate change. MOIT has jurisdiction over \nlarge industries (e.g., iron and steel, fertilizers), power generation, and oil and gas production. \nWithin  MOIT,  the  Office  of  the  General  Director  of  the  Industrial  Safety  Techniques  and \nEnvironment Agency (ISEA) will develop the NTP action plan. MOIT\u2019s action plan framework was \nofficially  launched  in  Ha  Noi  on  8  September  2010.11 In  addition  to  developing  a  suitable \nquantitative approach and decision support tools, the framework stresses the need for capacity \nstrengthening within the ministry and its constituent industries, and support for the development of \nenabling regulations and implementing rules.  \n \n4.  MOT has jurisdiction over roads, railways, airways, inland waterways, and the maritime \nsector. The ministry is developing a framework for its action plan (2011\u20132015), to be submitted to \nthe minister for approval by December 2010. Donor support for MOT includes assistance from the \nWorld Bank to develop an adaptation action plan for the country's major ports under a regional \nprogram focused on analyzing the economics of climate change adaptation.  \n \n5.  Climate change action plans for provinces and cities are as important as national ministerial \nplans. The proposed TA, therefore, aims to support the development of action plans in Thanh Hoa \nprovince, Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang cities. Thanh Hoa, the fourth-largest province in Viet Nam, is \noverwhelmingly rural and considered the second poorest. The province has embarked on an \nambitious industrialization process by hosting Viet Nam's second petrochemicals complex (the \nNghi Son Petrochemical). The province also has two large cement plants (the Cong Thanh and \nNghi Son Cement companies) and is in the process of expanding its power generation capacity by \nbuilding coal-fired power plants at the Nghi Son power complex. ADB is providing assistance \nthrough its Thanh Hoa City Comprehensive Socioeconomic Development Project12 to improve \nurban infrastructure\u2014roads, water delivery, sanitation, and wastewater treatment\u2014and tourism \nfacilities.  \n \n6.  Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is a commercial hub. It accounts for 23% of national gross \ndomestic product and attracts 20% of foreign direct investment flows. Over the past decade, it has \nposted annual growth rates of more than 10%. However, the city is highly vulnerable to climate \nchange. Its low elevation, burgeoning population, and expanding urban settlements put inhabitants \nand infrastructure at risk. Recognizing this vulnerability, the government has, under the Irrigation \nPlan for Flood Control for the HCMC area to 2025,13 initiated the construction of a series of major \ndrainage systems and dikes that will surround HCMC and divert water from floods, rains, and high \ntides to the Thi Vai River. Ahead of the city defining its own climate change action plan, ADB, \nthrough a joint study with JICA and the World Bank, helped conduct an analysis to 2050 of key \nclimate risks to major sectors and outlined a set of adaptation options. The study singled out the \ndevelopment of HCMC's action plan as a high priority as it will provide a framework for developing \nand implementing many of the study's recommendations.  \n                                                \n10 The United Nations Industrial Development Organization has been supporting the development of MOIT\u2019s action plan \nframework.  \n11 The successful development and implementation of MOIT's action plan will depend largely on its ability to involve Viet \nNam Electricity and Petro Viet Nam, its two constituent state-owned companies; the former is responsible for power \ngeneration and supply, the latter for oil and gas operations, and both are key sources of GHG emissions.  \n12 ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Preparing  the  Thanh  Hoa  City \nSocioeconomic Development Project. Manila. (Project No 41013 initiated in 2008). \n13 Approved by the Prime Minister on 28 October 2009 through Decision No 1547/QD-TTg with a total investment capital \nof VND11.53  trillion (about $650 million).  \n ", "  3 \n \n7.       Da Nang, in addition to capitalizing on its famed beaches and tourism opportunities, is also \nkeen on developing into an economically competitive \u2015green city.\u2016 Owing to its coastal location, the \ncity is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Recognizing the risks, the city is gearing up to deal \nwith mitigation and adaptation-related concerns. Da Nang is also participating in the Asian Coastal \nCities Climate Resilience program supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The city's Department \nof  Industry  and  Trade  and  Department  of  Transport  are  closely  working  with  the  People's \nCommittee to develop an NTP action plan for Da Nang.  \n \n8.  In  summary,  by  launching  the  NTP,  the  government  has  taken  a  bold  step  and \ndemonstrated its commitment to addressing climate change. However, translating the stated broad \nstrategic goal of building a less GHG-intensive and more climate-resilient economy into tangible \noutcomes in the medium term will require (i) a concerted effort by all line ministries, provinces, and \ncities  to  develop  detailed  and  realistic  action  plans;  (ii)  introduction  of  enabling  policies  and \nimplementing rules; (iii) establishment of data management frameworks and decision support tools; \nand (iv) greater capacity within the government, and industry and research institutes. Discussions \nbetween ADB, MOIT, MOT, and the People\u2019s Committees of Thanh Hoa, HCMC and Da Nang \nhighlighted a strong demand for ADB to help address this development challenges.  \n \n9.  The TA will develop and or implement detailed action plans in support of the NTP in Viet \nNam. The TA will support MOIT and MOT, Thanh Hoa province, and Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh \ncities\u2014collectively \u2015the target ministries, province, and cities\u2016\u2014in developing exemplary plans that \ncan be adapted to other sectors, province and municipalities. In developing these action plans, \nADB will pursue a flexible and context-specific approach that builds on existing frameworks (where \napplicable) and the efforts of other development actors. The TA will estimate the current and future \ncontribution  of  the  industry,  trade,  and  transport  sectors  to  GHG  emissions  under  different \neconomic growth scenarios, and determine mitigation opportunities. It will then identify climate \nchange-related risks to these sectors and develop appropriate adaptation options. This analysis \nwill be the basis for the development of sector-specific climate change action plans\u2014including \nmitigation and adaptation measures. The TA will also review and strengthen related policies and \nimplementing  rules,  build  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  plans,  and  conduct  a  public \nawareness program on climate change issues.  Finally, the TA will design five climate-resilience \npilot projects (one each for the target ministries, province, and cities), including a prefeasibility \nanalysis of technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be effective implementation of detailed NTP action plans by the \ntarget  ministries,  province,  and  cities.  The  outcome  will  be  greater  capacity  to  design  and \nimplement climate change response measures in the target ministries, province, and cities. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The key outputs of the TA are (i) development of detailed NTP action plans by the target \nministries, province, and cities; (ii) strengthening of institutional capacity of key agencies within \ngTohvee vrinemwse next,p rreessseead rhcehr eiinn satriteu ttheoss, e aonf dth et hceo nspurlitvaantte a nsde dcoto nr ott on epcelasns arailny dre pdreesseignnt  thcolisme aotfe A DcBha\u2019sn ge \nrmeesmpobnesrse,s B; oa(iridi)  ofd Desiriegcnto ras,n Md animagpelemmenetn, toart isotnaf f,o afn da m  caoy mbem purneliitmy inaawrya irne nnaetsusre . c ampaign;  and  (iv) \ndevelopment of pilot projects to help reduce GHG emissions and optimize adaptation responses to \nclimate risks. The TA outputs, including knowledge products and services, will be disseminated \n ", "4   \nthrough  in-country  workshops,  electronic  reports,  website  publication, and  other means  to be \nspecified in a knowledge dissemination and communication plan.  \n \n12.  The main activities of the TA will include:  \n \n(i)  estimating projected GHG emissions under business-as-usual and \u2015smart growth\u2016 \nscenarios for 2011\u20132030; identifying mitigation options; undertaking a cost-benefit \nanalysis; and developing an implementation plan for the top-ranked options;  \n(ii)  designing  and  building  a  GHG  emissions  database  and  inventory  that  can  be \nupdated and maintained;  \n(iii)  downscaling  climate  models  and  conducting  integrated  impact  assessment \nmodeling to identify key risks to economic sectors and human settlements, and \ndevelop adaptation plans; \n(iv)  integrating mitigation and adaptation action into a comprehensive climate action \nplan, and identifying the policy and implementing measures14 needed for effective \nimplementation;  \n(v)  assessing institutional capacity and training needs, and designing and implementing \na capacity-strengthening plan; \n(vi)  designing and implementing coordinated public awareness campaigns using focus \ngroups, public meetings, and TV, radio, and print media; and \n(vii)  creating a long and short list of mitigation and/or adaptation options, and finalizing \nthe design of a pilot project for each of the target ministries, province, and cities, as \nwell as presenting illustrative financing options.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.75 million equivalent, of which $2.50 million equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Nordic Development Fund and administered by ADB. The \ngrant  will  cover  remuneration, travel,  and  per diem for the  international  experts  and  national \nexperts or institutes; training seminars and conferences; and TA administration and support costs. \nThe Government of Viet Nam will finance the remaining $0.25 million equivalent in kind. Detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOIT  will  be  the  executing  agency.  Within  MOIT,  ISEA  will  be  the  focal  point.  The \nEnvironment Department within MOT and the people\u2019s committees of Thanh Hoa, HCMC, and Da \nNang will be the implementing agencies and oversee TA activities in their jurisdictions, under the \noverall coordination of MOIT. MOIT will help obtain government approvals for the TA, establish a \nnational steering committee for the TA\u2014comprising representatives and key constituents from the \nimplementing agencies (e.g., EVN and PetroVietnam within MOIT)\u2014and convene regular meetings \nof this committee. The committee\u2019s primary role will be to provide technical inputs for the TA, and \ngenerate broad acceptance of the TA approach and methodologies, and of the draft and final \naction plans. MONRE, as the NTP's standing office, will participate in the workshops and briefings \norganized under the TA, and will provide technical inputs to and endorsement of the draft and final \naction plans.15 MOIT will take the lead in approving all TA outputs on behalf of the government.  \n                                                \n14  For example, renewable and energy efficiency measures, building codes, land use planning, and zoning rules. \n15  In addition, to enable effective coordination with MONRE and strengthen its efforts to implement other ADB TA \nprojects that are relevant to this project (e.g., climate change adaptation in the Mekong Delta capacity development \nTA), a part-time national consultant will be appointed as a focal point at MONRE for the period of the TA. \n ", "  5 \n \n15.  This TA will be implemented in line with related work planned by ADB\u2019s Regional and \nSustainable Development Department, including a rapid assessment of energy and transport-\nrelated CO  Emissions for Asian Cities (HCMC case study), and the regional climate atlas, among \n2\nothers. Efforts will be made during TA implementation to involve other actors that are providing \nsupport for the NTP in Viet Nam (e.g., the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, AFD, \nDanish  International  Development  Assistance,  European  Union,  JICA,  and  UNDP). 16 All \ndisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment for the TA will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand turned over to the executing and implementing agencies upon TA completion.  \n \n16.  The key assumptions and risks are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \nInadequate staff resources within MOIT, MOT, and provincial and municipal departments, as well \nas weak technical capacity suggest that the executing and implementing agencies may not have \nenough expertise and capacity to support an efficient implementation of this TA, making this the \nmain  risk.  Therefore,  ADB's  TA  consulting  team  will  assign  a  full-time  coordinator  (national \nconsultant) to each of the executing and implementing agencies. This will improve coordination of \nstudy inputs and access to crucial data; foster support for policy dialogue and reform; and assist \nongoing capacity strengthening. The executing and implementing agencies have approved this \narrangement and have offered office space for the coordinators.  \n \n17.  Approximately 227 person-months of consulting services (65 person-months of international \nconsultants and 162 person-months of national consultants or services from national institutions) \nwill be required. It is proposed that the TA be implemented by an international firm supported by \nnational  consultants.  The  team  will  comprise  experts  in  climate  change  modeling  and  risk \nassessment, adaptation planning, institutional strengthening, sociology and economic analysis, \npublic communications strategy, and geographic information systems. Detailed terms of reference \nare in Appendix 3. ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) will apply to the selection of the firm. The firm will be hired after a quality-and-cost-based \nselection method (90:10) on the basis of full technical proposals.  \n \n18.  The TA will begin in March 2011 and be completed by March 2013.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,500,000 to the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam to be financed on a grant basis by the Nordic Development Fund for Support for the National \nTarget Program on Climate Change with a Focus on Energy and Transport.  \n \n                                                \n1T6 hTeh ev iAeswiasn e Cxiptieress Csleimda htee rCehina nagree  Rtheossiliee nocfe t hNee tcwoonrks ualntad nAtF aDn dha dvoe  innodtic naetecde asns ainritleyr erestp irne csoelnlatb tohroatsineg o wf iAthD thBe\u2019s A DB \nmeumndbeer rtsh,i sB ToAa,r dus oinf gD air peacrtaolrlesl,  cMofainnaangceinmg eanptp, roora cshta. fTf,h ea nsdp emciaficys b oef  tphree lcimollianbaorrya itnio nn awtiull rbee.   described in the letter of \nagreement that is being negotiated among the three parties. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEffective implementation of  Growth rate of GHG emissions  National  The government\u2019s commitment \ndetailed NTP action plans by  from target sectors reduced by  communication to the  to address climate change as \nMOIT, MOT, Thanh Hoa  2020 when compared with the  UNFCCC and  an integral part of development \nprovince, and Ho Chi Minh and  business-as-usual scenario   ministerial/national  planning continues.  \nDa Nang cities (the target  (specific targets are to be  GHG inventories.    \nministries, province, and cities).    developed by the target    The government continues to \n  ministries, province, and cities    emphasize rollout of the NTP \nduring the development of their  Data from the National  across all ministries, cities, and \naction plan frameworks, which  Steering Committee for  provinces.  \nis ongoing).
