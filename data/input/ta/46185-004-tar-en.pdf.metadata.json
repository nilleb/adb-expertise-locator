As most of the funds of subprojects 1 and 2 have been committed and there is expected \nto be significant demand for funding to support additional impact evaluation studies, we propose \nto start implementing subproject 3 with a total amount of $1.5 million in line with the TA design. A \nlist of indicative projects that may request impact evaluation funding from subproject 3 is in \nAttachment 3. \n \n1.  Impact, Outcome and Outputs \n \n4.  The  impact  will  be  improved  development  effectiveness  of  ADB-designed  projects \nresponsive to the development needs of DMCs. The outcome will be that impact evaluation is \nmainstreamed2  in  ADB  operations  through  each  subproject  resulting  in  well-designed  and \nmonitored ADB projects in DMCs. Key outputs of Subproject 3 will include (i) impact evaluation \nstudies adopting appropriate methodology with effective technical support conducted, (ii) impact \nevaluation awareness-raising seminars and capacity building workshops for ADB staff and DMC \nofficials,  and  (iii)  reports  and  dissemination  workshops  on  lessons  learned  from  review  of \nmethodologies  and  conduct  of  pilot  studies.  The  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  is  in \nAttachment 4. \n \n  2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n5.  Subproject 3 will comprise two main components: (a) the conduct of five or more impact \nevaluation  studies  applying  various  methodologies  and  survey  instruments;  and  (b)  the \ndevelopment of impact evaluation methodologies, approaches, and capacities. \n \n6.  Under component (a), the subproject will continue to fund impact evaluation studies \ninitiated by the regional departments with five or more studies aimed. In principle, $200,000 will \nbe allocated to each region for conduct of impact evaluation studies under the subproject. The \ninterventions to be evaluated include ADB lending and non-lending projects, and DMCs\u2019 programs \nand projects to which ADB has related operational activity, or where the intervention proposed for \nstudy relates to ongoing or future areas of support identified in country operations business plans \nor country partnership strategies. \n \n7.  Component (b) of the subproject will support the following activities to enhance DMCs and \nADB\u2019s capacity for conducting innovative impact evaluations, evidence-based policy dialogue and \nmanagement of knowledge generated from the impact evaluation studies: (i) reviewing impact \nevaluation methodologies and improvements in techniques and tools for sector- and theme-\nspecific studies and assisting preparation of impact evaluation proposals; (ii) conducting one to \nthree pilot studies that apply the best practice application of impact evaluation methodology to \ninform current and/or future ADB operations. The pilot studies intend to reinforce mainstreaming \nof best practice impact evaluation in sectors that have received relatively little evaluation coverage \nto date. The projects should have significant involvement of ADB staff in designing and guiding, \nand executing the pilot studies; (iii) conducting impact evaluation awareness raising and capacity \nbuilding for DMC stakeholders and ADB staff; (iv) maintaining a central impact evaluation data \nportal containing information on project baseline, mid-line, and end-line surveys (e.g., reports, \nquestionnaires, metadata\u2014details on sampling methodology, interviewer manuals, field data); \n                                                \n2  Impact evaluation is mainstreamed in ADB operations when it is integrated in the process of designing projects in \nDMCs based on gained experiences from actual conduct of impact evaluation studies adopting appropriate \nmethodology, knowledge-sharing workshops and conferences, and capacity building activities.  \n ", " \nand  (v)  conducting  knowledge-sharing  activities  (i.e.  regional  conferences  where  impact \nevaluation studies conducted will be presented; and workshops and seminars where experts will \nbe invited to share methods, practices, and lessons on impact evaluation) and publishing and \ndisseminating impact evaluation studies (publishing impact evaluation studies for distribution to \nADB and government counterparts, and uploading studies to the ADB website). \n \n  3.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  Subproject 3 is estimated to cost $1,500,000, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Attachment 5. \n \n9.  The proposed subproject has been registered with OSFMD Registration No. ERCD-C-\n07/2017. An updated status of commitments of TA funds is in Attachment 6.  \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The subproject will commence on 1 November 2017 and will be completed on 31 March \n2019. Except for the statement on the completion date of C-TA0012 and the total required person-\nmonths, the implementation arrangements described for subproject 1 (paras. 8 to 13 in the memo \nin  Attachment  1a)  will  continue to  apply  in general.  Consultant  packages for  each  impact \nevaluation study will comprise both firms and individuals, as appropriate. About 53 person-months \nof  international  and  66  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required  for \nSubproject 3. Individual consultants will be recruited using individual consultants selection (ICS) \nmethod while recruitment of firms will employ consultants\u2019 qualifications selection (CQS) method, \nLump  sum  payments/output-based  contracts  will  be  considered  as  much  as  possible  for \nconsulting services. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Attachment 7. Disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n11.  Based  on  the  experience  in  implementing  the  first  two  subprojects,  the  following \nspecifications and/or clarifications are provided. \n \n(i)  As with subprojects 1 and 2, to strike a balance between allocating the TA funds equally \nacross regions and ensuring funds are used on a timely basis, an indicative allocation of \n$200,000 for each regional department will be applied in component (a). Each regional \ndepartment will have until 30 June 2018 (8 months) to receive approval of an IE study \nproposal from the Impact Evaluation Committee3 (IEC) within its allocation. Beginning 1 \nJuly 2018, the IEC will consider proposals on a \u201cfirst come first serve\u201d basis regardless \nwhether the department submitting the proposal has used its indicative allocation. In \naddition, if the study fails to move ahead by making its first contract award within six \nmonths after approval of the proposal, the IEC can cancel the funding commitment and \nre-allocate  the  funds  to  other  studies.  The  regional  department  whose  IE  study  is \ncancelled due to non-disbursement may re-submit proposals for review in lieu of the \ncancelled study. \n                                                \n3  The Impact Evaluation Committee (IEC) was established on 20 February 2013, comprising five regional departments \n(CWRD, EARD, PARD, SARD, and SERD) and SPD, OSFMD, SDCC and ERCD with voting power, and IED and \nPSOD with observer functions. Each department has one principal and one alternate representatives in the IEC. The \nmain responsibilities of the IEC include: (a) providing overall guidance and oversight for Cluster TA 0012; and (b) \nreviewing and approving project proposals and budgets to be considered for impact evaluation from Cluster TA 0012. \n ", " \n \n(ii) Regional departments can propose to evaluate programs and projects in DMCs that are \nnot  directly  supported  by  ADB  with  funding  under  component  (a),  given  DMC\u2019s \nendorsement and proper justifications subject to IEC review. \n \n(iii) The pilot study under component (b) will be proposed by ERCD staff with endorsement \nfrom the regional department whose DMC will be the site of the proposed evaluation. The \nproposal will require the review and approval of the approving authority.4 The proposal will \nbe considered on a \u201cfirst come first serve\u201d basis and not counted toward the regional \nallocation under component (a). Under component (b), consultants will also be engaged \nto  assist  in  developing  proposals,  maintaining  the  Impact  Evaluation  Portal,  and \ncoordinating various activities under the TA. \n \nD.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n12.  Relevant  department/offices  have  been  consulted  and  comments  received  were \nincorporated as appropriate (Attachment 8). \n \n13.
