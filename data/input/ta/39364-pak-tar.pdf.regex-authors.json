INTRODUCTION \n1.  On  the  basis  of  requests  from  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  some  provincial \ngovernments, a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the multi-province Community \nWater Storage and Irrigated Agriculture Development Project (TA) was included in the 2006\u20132008 \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update  for  Pakistan1.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  TA  visited \nPakistan from 22 January to 8 February 2006, including visits to the North-West Frontier Province \n(NWFP),  Punjab,  and  Sindh.  The  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  both  federal  and \nprovincial  governments  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing  arrangements,  terms  of  reference,  and  geographical  focus for  TA  (see  Design  and \nMonitoring Framework in Appendix 1).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan is one of the world\u2019s most arid countries, with an average rainfall of under 240 \nmillimeters (mm) a year. The population and economy depend heavily on the Indus River and its \ntributaries.  A  large  and  complex  hydraulic  system  constitutes  the  backbone  of  a  flourishing \nagrarian economy that accounts for about 25% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs \nabout half of the labor force. Yet, a significant proportion of the country remains outside this system \nand  suffers  severe  water  scarcity.  In  NWFP,  these  barani  areas  account  for  49.0%  of  total \ncultivated land, and in Punjab for 18.6%. The lack of secure water sources for agriculture and other \nuses is seen as a major constraint to improving peoples\u2019 livelihoods. Yet, with mean annual rainfall \nof 500\u2013800 mm, of which 60% occurs from mid-July to the end-August, the potential for water \nstorage is high and little exploited.  \n \n3.  Small dam projects were initiated by the Government in 1961 and received support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in the mid-1980s.3 They resulted in more assured agricultural \nproduction  and,  in  some  cases,  more  secure  water  supply.  Nevertheless,  their  economic \nperformance remains generally low due to (i) slow development of irrigated agriculture in the \ncommand area, (ii) reduced dam life from sedimentation, and (iii) limited utilization of reservoir \nwater  other  than  for  agriculture.4 However,  substantial  potential  exists  for  improvements  that \ncapitalize on the value of water stored in reservoirs and expand local water services. \n \n4.  Despite Pakistan\u2019s small dams generally being located in areas that yield a lot of sediment, \nlimited attention has been paid to reducing sediment inflow. Survey results from projects completed \nover the past 40 years reveal that, in a number of cases, storage capacity has been halved within \none to two generations, with consequent reductions in economic benefits. Introducing sustainable \nwatershed management to mitigate sediment inflows is therefore critical and a priority for both new \nand existing dams. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006-2008). Manila. \n2  TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 February 2006. \n3  ADB. 1985. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Small Dams Project. Manila (Loan 0750-PAK[SF], approved on 31 October 1985, for \n$39 million. The term \u201csmall dams\u201d used in this context relates to projects undertaken by small dams organizations of \nNWFP and Punjab that are generally in the range of 15\u201330 meters high but recently include projects on the order of 50 \nmeters. Although the \u201csmall dams\u201d terminology used in Pakistan has been retained here, the technical procedures for \nplanning, designing, and operating subprojects to be reviewed under TA will follow international practice for large \ndams, including those of the International Commission on Large Dams and the World Bank, in which large dams are \ndefined as higher than 15 meters or with a storage capacity greater than 3 million cubic meters. \n4  ADB. 1997. Project Completion Report on the Small Dams Project in Pakistan. Manila; and ADB. 1999. Project \nPerformance Audit Report on the Small Dams Project in Pakistan. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Slow or inadequate development of irrigated agriculture in the cultivable command area \n(CCA) is a major drag on the economic performance of small dams projects. The main reasons \ninclude  (i)  delays  in  developing  watercourses  and  preparing  farmland  for  irrigation  and  (ii) \ndifficulties in adopting higher-value irrigated cropping systems. Farmers with no experience in \nirrigated agriculture and scarce financial resources have been left to their own devices to develop \nwatercourses, organize water distribution, and level their fields\u2014all at high cost. \n \n6.  Efficient irrigation methods are also lacking. Options such as pressurized piped systems \nwould be a significant improvement over the current practice of gravity irrigation, which has high \nconveyance  and  distribution  losses.  Even  where  extension  support  to  promote  remunerative \nirrigated cropping systems is provided, the systems are not adapted. The current approach treats \nall farmers as a homogenous group, ignoring farmers\u2019 differences and specific constraints. As a \nresult, most farmers have not changed cropping patterns and treat reservoir water only as a \nsupplementary source for traditional crops. Some encouraging cases of new high-value cropping \nsystems being adopted are the exception rather than the rule. \n \n7.  Most existing small dam projects focus on irrigation. Benefits from other water uses are \noften  foregone,  undervalued,  or  incorporated  at  a  later  date  at  additional  cost.  Taking  a \nmultipurpose and integrated view of water resource development through small and medium dams \nfor communities in the barani areas can satisfy other vital community needs and also introduce \nincome-generating activities to help cover the project\u2019s operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \n(e.g., reservoir fisheries5 and water supply to neighboring villages and towns). \n \n8.  Lessons learned from previous experience call for improving implementation methodology. \nOwnership  by  beneficiary  communities  is  low  in  most  cases,  which  can  explain  problems \nexperienced after dam construction such as slow development of the CCA, limited maintenance of \ncanals, and lack of watershed stabilization. Enabling conditions to stimulate ownership should be \nsystematically  enhanced  through  effective  consultation,  including  with  women,  and  strong \nparticipation throughout the project cycle. Local nongovernment organizations have proven to \nmobilize communities efficiently, and their support might be required. Similarly, lack of coordination \nbetween line departments due to weak implementation structure and arrangements has led to core \ncomponents being neglected or to inappropriate sequencing of interventions, resulting in lower \nproject efficiency.  \n \n9.  Considerable experience in planning and designing small dam projects exists in Pakistan. \nAlthough dams already built are considered sound from a safety perspective, the opportunity exists \nto optimize designs and update procedures in light of experience gained over the past 30 years \nand to take into account advances made in the international arena. \n \n10.  The environmental and resettlement impacts of small dams are case-specific, ranging from \nnegligible to significant. Cumulative environmental effects from the presence of several dams in a \nparticular  sub-basin  need  to  be  evaluated.  To  comply  with  ADB  and  Government  safeguard \npolicies, the ensuing project will be classified as category A.  \n \n                                                 \n5  The current approach of auctioning reservoir fisheries to a contractor raises minimal income and does not foster \nprivate contractor investment in more intensive fish production.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  TA will prepare a sector-like project to increase social and economic development of the \nrural  population  in  barani  areas  of  NWFP  and  Punjab  by  introducing  sustainable  irrigated \nagriculture and providing water for domestic and other uses. Subprojects to be financed under the \nensuing investment will comprise (i) small to medium dams and associated irrigation systems, (ii) \nother  community  water  services,  (iii) improved  watershed  management,  and  (iv)  agricultural \nsupport services. Agreement will be reached on the scope, components, subproject selection \ncriteria,  environmental  and  social  safeguard  assurance  and  mitigation  measures,  cost,  and \nfinancing  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  project.  Areas  of  policy  dialogue  will  be \nidentified by TA as the basis for discussion with the Government during appraisal of the project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  TA will review the performance of existing small dam projects and assess a number of \noptions for future development with a strong emphasis on community management. Alternative \nstrategies  will  be  identified  for  four  aspects  critical  to  the  success  of  future  investments:  (i) \nappropriate  models  of  irrigated  agriculture,  (ii)  regeneration  and  sustainable  management  of \nwatersheds, (iii) multiple uses of reservoir water, and (iv) developing community ownership of \nsubprojects.  Maximizing  subproject  investment  returns  and  subproject  sustainability  will  be \nessential in assessing options. TA will be based on the five components described below. \n \n13.  Component 1: Testing Options for Improving Dams\u2019 Sustainability and Economic \nReturn. A range of development models for irrigated agriculture development will be explored by \nanalyzing different farming systems and their specific constraints to adopting higher-value irrigated \ncrops.  The  analysis  will  generate  a  range  of  investment  responses  and  associated  support \npackages tailored to the prevailing socioeconomic conditions of farmers as they progress from \nsubsistence  agriculture  towards  more  diverse  and  higher-value  agriculture.  Watershed \nregeneration and sustainable management will be promoted by addressing the factors that led to \nland degradation, learning from past and ongoing community-based natural resource management \nprojects. Strategies for community-based watershed management of existing and new dams will be \ndeveloped together with a program for institutional reform and capacity building. Potential for \nmultiple  use  of  reservoir  water  will  be  explored,  including  irrigation,  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation, domestic uses, fisheries, livestock, mini hydropower, serving downstream environmental \nneeds, and recreation. This will involve an assessment of the water rights of existing and new \nusers. In terms of financial sustainability, options will be identified to generate revenues to support \nan O&M budget for the dam and irrigation system and contribute to a village development fund. In \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Water for All: The Water Policy of ADB (2001), a service provider approach \nwill be pursued via the creation of farmers\u2019 organizations to operate and maintain the irrigation \nschemes  and  manage  watershed  stabilization.  Consultations  with  communities  will  focus  on \ncreating an enabling framework for local ownership of subprojects and stimulating the commitment \nnecessary  for  command  area  development,  O&M,  and  watershed  management. 6  Specific \nguidelines will be developed, and support provided, to ensure that communities are meaningfully \nincluded in planning and design from an early stage and that validation workshops take place \ninvolving communities. Local governments and line departments will be organized to present PPTA \n                                                 \n6  Options  for  providing  legal  status  to  beneficiary  organizations  will  be  examined  (e.g.,  recognition  as  farmers\u2019 \norganizations as defined under the provincial irrigation and drainage authority acts). A starting point is provided in the \ninstitutional model proposed under TA 3131-PAK: Strengthening of Farmers Organizations in Small Dams Operations, \napproved on 15 December 1998 in the amount of $150,000. \n ", "4   \nrecommendations. Subproject eligibility criteria will need to reflect a demand-driven development \napproach.  \n \n14.  Component  2: Preparation  of  3\u20134  Sample  Subprojects. TA will review and update \nfeasibility  studies  prepared  by  government  agencies  for  three  or  four  sample  subprojects \nrepresentative of the wider list of candidate projects in NWFP and Punjab. The review will include \nnew options to mainstream into subproject design irrigated agriculture development, watershed \nmanagement,  community-based  O&M,  and  multiple  water  uses.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies, TA consultants will conduct an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of a \nsample subproject and facilitate knowledge transfer to small dams organizations (SDOs)7 and \nprovincial authorities on EIA of dam projects. A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) will be \ncarried out to determine key environmental and development issues and to make a preliminary \nsub-basin assessment of the nature and scale of any cumulative subproject environmental impacts \non downstream users and wetlands. Social impacts for sample subprojects involving resettlement \nwill  be  assessed  and  resettlement  plans  developed.  A  resettlement  framework  for  remaining \nsubprojects will be prepared. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  Component 3: Subproject Selection Criteria and Policy Issues. Selection criteria will be \nprepared taking into account evaluations of previous small and medium dam projects and TA \nreview  of  sample  subprojects.  Criteria  will  include  technical,  economic,  social,  environmental, \nsustainability,  and  governance  factors.  Policy  dialogue  and  institutional  recommendations  on \nmatters related to small dam development will be pursued under TA, including procedures for \ndelivering  agricultural  support,  community  ownership  of  irrigation  systems,  arrangements  for \nwatershed management, and cross-agency coordination.   \n \n16.  Component 4: Reconnaissance Survey in Sindh. In Sindh, inadequate information has \nbeen generated so far on the potential to develop community water storage in arid areas. This \nprovince will not be covered under the ensuing loan but, at the request of the government of Sindh, \nTA will carry out a reconnaissance-level assessment based on existing studies and proposals of \nthe irrigation and agriculture departments. This assessment will inform any future decision on \ninvestment support in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program. \n \n17.  Component 5: Institutional Capacity and Implementation Structure. Introducing new \nmodels and technology for irrigated agriculture and an integrated approach to water resource \ndevelopment  will  require  a  commensurate  change  in  planning  processes,  interaction  with \ncommunities, and interagency coordination. TA will assess the institutional capacity of relevant \nagencies and make recommendations to strengthen organizational structures and build capacity. \nPlanning and design procedures and guidelines for small dam projects will be reviewed and \nupdated.8 TA will facilitate a cross-provincial working group to undertake this review with key \nprovincial officials who possess experience in small dam projects, together with representatives of \ndomestic consulting firms that carry out feasibility studies and designs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $1,125,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nthat ADB finance $900,000 equivalent. TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the remaining cost of \n                                                 \n7  SDOs were created under the provincial departments of water and power. Their mandate is to implement small dam \nprovincial projects and manage the O&M of the dams. \n8  This exercise will include a survey on sedimentation of existing dams. \n ", "  5\n$225,000  equivalent.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that approval of TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The provincial irrigation and power departments of NWFP and Punjab will be the executing \nagencies for TA and will each nominate a senior staff member to be TA project director reporting to \ntheir respective secretary. They will provide furnished offices for TA, phone lines, support for \nworkshops and data collection, and logistical assistance for field investigations. The provincial \nirrigation, agriculture, forestry, and fishery departments will provide counterpart staff to the TA team. \nIn each province, two committees will be formed: (i) a secretary-level steering committee for policy \nguidance  chaired  by  the  chairman  of  the  planning  and  development  departments,  with \nrepresentation from irrigation, agriculture, forestry and wildlife, and fisheries departments, and \nothers as required, and (ii) a project technical advisory committee, to assist in implementation and \ninteragency coordination, chaired by a project director and comprised of technical officers and \ncommunity representatives. Steering committees will be formed and counterpart staff appointed \nprior to TA contract negotiations. The consultants will facilitate a cross-provincial working group to \nundertake a detailed review of planning and design guidelines. \n \n20.  TA will be implemented over 6 months from October 2006 to March 2007 and will require \n23 person-months of international consulting services, and 45 person-months of domestic, in \nagricultural development, institutions, irrigation planning, economics, watershed management, dam \nplanning and design, rural water use, and social and environmental assessment. Appendix 4 \nprovides  the  outline  terms  of  reference.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its \nBorrowers  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. A simplified technical proposal will be used, and the selection method will be \nquality-  and  cost-based.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines and transferred to the Government after completion of TA. \n \n21.  Outputs from TA include (i) an inception report after 1 month that presents a detailed work \nprogram,  consultation  strategy,  preliminary  selection  criteria,  and  nominations  for  sample \nsubprojects; (ii) a midterm review report after 3 months that records progress, initial findings, and \nconclusions, as well as issues to be addressed in the second half of PPTA; (iii) a draft final report \nafter 5 months including findings from each of the TA components, feasibility reviews of sample \nsubprojects, updated selection criteria, proposals for institutional strengthening, and the results of \nthe  reconnaissance  assessment  in  Sindh;  and  (iv)  an  updated  final  report  1  month  later.  In \naccordance with ADB\u2019s public communication policy, all of the TA reports will be disclosed to the \npublic upon finalization. Where resettlement plans are prepared, they will be disclosed to people \naffected in a form and language they can understand. Tripartite meetings between the provincial \nand federal governments, ADB, and TA consultants will be held in Islamabad following submission \nof the inception, midterm, and draft final reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Pakistan for preparing the Community Water Storage and Irrigated Agriculture \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact (the project)      Assumption \nIncreased social and  Remunerative irrigated  Government economic  Government policies continue to \neconomic development  agriculture developed over  and social surveys  support and stimulate inclusive \nthrough agricultural  approximately 30,000 ha,    economic growth in remote arid \ngrowth in barani areas of  1,500 MT of fish produced  Baseline and periodic  areas. \nPunjab and NWFP   per year, 25,000  monitoring reports   \n  households with improved  commissioned under the  Risk \n  access to drinking water,  project   Political instability and \nwashing  facilities, and    increased insecurity prevent \nwater for livestock by  Project completion report,  project implementation. \n31 December 2012 (over  gender-disaggregated \nthe baseline of  impact report, and \n31 December 2007a)  possible project \n  performance audit report \n   \nOutcome (the TA)       \nAgreed sector project  Agreement reached  MOU signed by the  Assumption \nbased on sustainable  between the Government  Government and ADB  Communities demonstrate a \nconcepts of irrigated  and ADB on the final    willingness to adopt new \nagriculture development  design regarding its  Approved subproject  farming systems and \nand increasing water  scope, components,  feasibility studies by the  management responsibilities for \navailability for crops and  implementation  Government and ADB  the watershed. \nother uses  arrangements, and   \n  financing plan by the first  Risks \nquarter of  2007, leading  Shift in Government \nto loan appraisal mission  development priorities  \n \nThe Government decides to \nseek alternative funding. \n \nOutputs (the TA)      Assumptions \nProject design is produced    PPTA final report submitted  The Government supports the \nbased on the following:    by February 2007, reflecting  design activities and \n      encourages strong coordination \n1.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Pakistan:  \n \nNational Impact on Poverty. Agriculture is a crucial sector in Pakistan\u2019s economy and for poverty reduction since it \naccounts for about 25% of the gross domestic product and employs about half of the labor force. Access to water for \nirrigation or other purposes is considered similarly important. Pakistan is considered one of the world\u2019s most water-\nstressed countries, and yet projections are that over 30% more water will be needed over the next 20 years to meet \nincreased agricultural, domestic, and industrial demand due to high population growth and a quickly changing \neconomy. Since Pakistan uses almost all of its available surface and underground water, water storage and improved \nwater management will play an essential role in helping Pakistan cope with this situation both in the Indus Basin and \noutside in the barani, or arid areas. \n \nPakistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) recognizes poverty as a predominantly rural phenomenon and \nrural development as the key to fighting poverty in Pakistan. The PRSP pro-poor rural development strategy focuses \non developing land and water resources, rural electrification, and other subsectors like fisheries, as well as on \nincreasing crop and livestock productivity. The proposed community water storage project\u2019s expected outputs are in \nline with this strategy.  \n \nSimilarly, the project is expected to contribute substantially to increasing access to drinking water and addressing \ninadequate sanitation, which are seen as important elements under pillar III of the PRSP and recognized in the \nMedium-Term  Development  Framework  as  a  national  priority  if  Pakistan  is  to  achieve  its  non-income-related \nobjectives in connection with the Millennium Development Goals.  \n \nRegional Impact on Poverty. The project concentrates on barani areas of Punjab and NWFP where the extreme \nvariability of rainfall and lagging development support in irrigated areas keep agricultural productivity low and poverty \nlevels high compared with the rest of the country. In dry years, these barani areas are severely affected and the \nresulting economic losses and their repercussions on poverty are significant.  At a time when the country is about to \nmake major investment in large storage dams to increase water availability for future generations in the Indus River \nsystem, simultaneous investment in multipurpose small to medium dams in barani areas reflects sound and balanced \nplanning toward reducing poverty gaps between different regions.   \n \nProject-Specific Impact on Poverty. By making irrigation water available to currently rainfed farming areas, the \nproject will enable farmers to achieve higher yields per hectare of existing traditional subsistence crops like wheat, \nmaize, and millet, as well as encourage the cultivation of short-duration, labor-intensive cash crops like seasonal \nvegetables, and thereby increase the income of beneficiaries. However, by promoting the development of irrigated \nagriculture, the project will benefit mainly landowners and not the most vulnerable groups in rural communities, who \nown hardly any land. What may, however, directly benefit the most vulnerable people is increasing water availability \nfor purposes other than agriculture. It may also offer indirect benefits by generating job opportunities, since the project \nwill promote the production of higher-value irrigated crops, and these crops are generally much more labor intensive \nthan subsistence agriculture. In rural areas of Pakistan, agricultural labor is usually provided mostly by poor, landless \nhouseholds. Poor men and women work on farmland mostly as seasonally and/or permanently hired labor to \nsupplement their income or to earn a marginal living, and for meeting their such needs as healthcare and education. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA social assessment specialist will be responsible for carrying out poverty, social, and gender assessments in the \nproposed project areas in the NWF and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, focusing especially on the selected 3\u20134 initial \ncore subprojects to be implemented. The specialist will carry out a socioeconomic profile of potential beneficiary and \naffected communities according to the requirements of ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Assessment, and by \nusing participatory rural appraisal (PRA). The PRA techniques to be used in the field study will include, but not be \nlimited to, (i) secondary data collection, (ii) key informant interviews, (iii) participatory mapping (showing ethnic \ndistribution, poverty and problem areas, etc.), (iv) focus group discussions (with both men and women) for collecting \ncommunity data, (v) Individual Interviews (with both men and women) for collecting data on sample households, and \n(vi) participatory ranking (sources of income, major problems, perceived positive and negative impacts of the project, \nand suggestions for improving project design). The study will focus especially on the following aspects of the \ncommunities: \n(i)  socioeconomic formation and structure of the benefiting villages, by ethnicity, occupation, land tenure, \nincome level, poverty distribution, etc.; \n(ii)  availability, quality, and utilization of the basic social services and facilities, including roads, drinking water, \nhealth, education, employment, agricultural inputs and extension service, and the like; \n(iii)  community response to the proposed project interventions and their concerns, interests, and suggestions for \nimprovements and/or alterations in the project design; \n(iv)  the situation regarding social cohesion or conflict and the possibility of organizing communities to actively \nparticipate in project planning, implementation, and subsequent operation and maintenance; \n(v)  identification of vulnerable groups (e.g., households headed by women, landless labor, sharecroppers, \nfamilies with disabled people) and ways to enhance project impact on these specific groups; and \n(vi)  status and roles of women in the community, especially in agriculture and animal husbandry. \n \nRecommendations should include feasible poverty reduction and mitigation measures, along with an indicative budget \nand implementation strategies. \n \n \nC.

Yes     No  \nStakeholder analysis and consultations will be conducted during project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA), through PRA and other techniques, to inform the poverty, social, and gender analysis and the \ndesign of the proposed project. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nTechnical assistance will prepare a stakeholder participation strategy for the project based on pilot experiences with \nthe 3\u20134 initial subprojects. The participation strategy covers the entire project lifecycle, including the identification, \ndesign, and construction phases. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe strategy will focus on (i) providing drinking water supplies, (ii) constructing village water collection tanks,(iii) the \nwatering of animals, (iv) washing, and (v) vegetable farming to create labor-intensive opportunities for poor rural \nwomen. Specific women\u2019s groups will have to be formed and involved in project planning and design to ensure their \nparticular constraints are well understood and that irrigation schemes and water delivery facilities are designed \naccording to these needs and constraints. Detailed gender action plans will be prepared during PPTA. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \n \nE.

The impact \nmay  be  significant.  PPTA  will  prepare  a  resettlement \nframework and sample resettlement plans, as individual \nsubprojects  will  be  selected  during  project \nimplementation.  \n    Depending on the irrigation strategy chosen, a sizable   \n   Significant  percentage of farmers may face difficulty financing the   Yes \nAffordability    transition from rainfed to irrigated agriculture and from   \n Not significant  subsistence  to  cash  crops  (leveling  land,  purchasing    No \n  irrigation  equipment  and  farm  inputs,  and  transporting \n None  produce to markets, etc.). Credit is necessary to support \nfarmer\u2019s initial investments. A number of credit agencies \ncurrently  operate  in  almost  all  project  areas,  such  as \nagricultural  and  commercial  banks,  the  micro  credit-\ndispersing  Khushali  Bank,  and  nongovernment \norganizations.
