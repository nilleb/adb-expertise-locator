THE WOMEN\u2019S FINANCE EXCHANGE \n \n1.  The REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace1, approved in \nNovember 2020 is under implementation. It will facilitate and broaden access to finance for \nwomen and women-owned or women-led micro, small and medium-sized businesses (WMSMEs) \nand communicate ADB\u2019s efforts in this area to encourage more lending to this sector. Many \nfinancial institutions (FIs) in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) have not targeted \nwomen borrowers and do not recognize the untapped commercial potential. 2 They do not provide \nsuitable and affordable products for this clientele and/or lack the awareness of the barriers that \nwomen or women\u2019s businesses3 encounter when trying to access financial services.4 The impacts \nof the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have reinforced the importance of a digital \neconomy to change business models and to integrate digital channels into how financial service \nproviders or businesses engage with customers. \n \n2.  During this period and post-COVID-19, a dedicated online platform can help support FIs \nand their existing and potential women borrowers. For branding purposes the Women\u2019s Financing \nMarketplace was renamed to the Women\u2019s Finance Exchange (the \u201cWFX\u201d) in August 2021. The \nWFX will be innovative in its work and take a digital and more agile approach for interaction and \nengagement. Amongst a number of activities, it is expected that the WFX will aggregate and \ndisseminate products on gender financing within ADB and to the broader external audience and \nsupport the identification of cutting-edge technologies for FIs to achieve operational efficiencies, \nreach and scale, and/or develop new products to digitize business models, such as alternative \ncredit scoring models, mobile technology, cloud technology, and online delivery channels. Such \nactivities are being piloted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) first. In addition, capacity is being \nstrengthened for FIs to promote gender responsive financial service delivery and women\u2019s \nbusinesses to improve viability, as needed, through a range of digital toolkits, webinars and online \nsupport.  Linkages to other programs and initiatives on enabling access to finance for women, \ninternal and external to ADB5 are being established and a community platform to attract other co-\nfinanciers, including potential TA funding providers, is also being created.  \n \n3.  The TA cluster is envisaged to have 4 Subprojects: (i) design, set up and maintenance of \nthe marketplace, (ii) innovation and technologies, (iii) capacity building, and (iv) expansion of the \nmarketplace. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n4.  This is the fourth subproject under the REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s \nFinancing Marketplace. The first subproject was approved in November, the second and third \nsubproject in December 2021, respectively, and consultants have been recruited. \n \n \n1  The Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace was renamed Women\u2019s Finance Exchange in August 2021 \n2  Financial institutions in this context are banks and non-bank financial institutions including microfinance institutions, \nhousing finance, and insurance companies, for instance. \n3  Womens\u2019 business in this context means micro-, small- and medium-sized women-owned or women-managed \nbusinesses. \n4  Barriers are for example limited financial literacy, insufficient credit history, and lack of collateral. \n5  For example, PSFI\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program or ADB Ventures and SDCC\u2019s Gender \nand Development initiatives or TechforImpact. \n ", "2 \n5.  The first year of WFX has been busy, starting operations and rolling-out activities which, \namong others, resulted with the creation of a landing page on ADB.org (adb.org/womens-finance-\nexchange) and the official launch with a webinar on 12 August 2021. The launch was attended \nby almost 300 participants from the private and public sector. Further, the WFX started to support \nthe first financial institution in PNG to identify new technologies that would support reaching out \nto women-owned or led small- and medium sized enterprises (WSMEs), considering the specific \ncontext in which the institution is operating. This included research, institutional and market \nassessments, and a hackathon to find suitable fintech solutions. In addition, the first online training \nfor WSMEs was piloted in Papua New Guinea. This was especially relevant in the pandemic \nenvironment and can easily be scaled in other countries. As part of the communication activities \nthree case studies, two videos, and four women client interviews were prepared, three webinars \nwere organized, and the first newsletter will be published in December. \n \n6.  The WFX also conducted a strategic review, including a branding exercise, with selected \nstakeholders from within ADB as well as external. It has become evident that for branding \npurposes  and  to  successfully  reach  out  and  to  build  a  community,  a  more  agile  working \nenvironment and set-up was necessary. This includes a platform (website) which provides \ninteractive features for engagement, such as member log-in with specific sites, chat functions, \ncontact possibilities, SEO-optimized content, mobile friendly and possibility for site analytics. \n \n7.  During the year, WFX attended several webinars, knowledge events and held feedback \nrounds with FIs and women\u2019s businesses. While it is clear that much work needs to be done to \nclose the financing gap estimated at $1.7 trillion for WMSMEs6, it is  also evident that the goal \nshould not only be improving access to finance for women but also make them more sustainable \nand resilient to climate change and other calamities.  \n \n8.  At this year\u2019s UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), global leaders, financiers and \nadvocates discussed new action plans and commitments to progress faster on global climate \ngoals. It is equally important to consider how these actions will impact the livelihoods of low-\nincome populations, especially in developing and emerging market economies. Inclusive financial \nservices, innovative financing models, and technologies will play an important role to support \nthese economies in i) climate adaptation practices and making them more resilient to the effects \nof climate change, for example through better housing structures, ii) sustaining ecosystems \nthrough smart farming practices, which also supports the lowering of carbon emissions, and iii) \ntransitioning to lower-carbon or cleaner energy consumption solutions, such as for example, \nrooftop solar solutions for micro and small businesses. 7  \n \n9.  The shift towards a green economy is estimated to require around $1 trillion of investments \nannually and could yield direct economic gains of $26 trillion by 2030. Research has shown \nwomen entrepreneurs are more likely to start businesses with a sustainable focus, however, \nWMSMEs  face  significantly  larger  challenges,  compared  to  men,  in  accessing  finance  or \naffordable goods and assets8, limiting women\u2019s social participation and chances for upward \nmobility. WMSMEs are more likely to cite access to finance as a major or severe constraint.   \n \n6  World Bank Group, SME Finance Forum, IFC. 2017. MSME Finance Gap 2017.

Furthermore, women in developing or emerging countries are often disproportionately \naffected by climate change. For example, women are more reliant than men on natural resources \nthat may be adversely impacted by climate change. For instance, in Asia, rural women are \nprimarily responsible for collecting water for their families. As climate change makes access to \nwater less reliable, they will need to walk farther every day, limiting the time they have to engage \nin other tasks, including alternative income generation activities.10 Women\u2019s improved access to \nfinance not only can facilitate larger developmental impact, but women-owned and women-led \nbusinesses can play a key role in driving the green economy transition. At the same time, the \nParis Agreement of 2015 targeting to limit global warming to below 2\u00b0C (compared to pre-\nindustrial levels), also emphasized that climate action needs to respect, and promote gender \nequality. \n \n11.  ADB has recently elevated its ambition to deliver climate financing to its developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to $100 billion from 2019\u20132030. Expanded targets will also increase \nclimate finance in ADB\u2019s private sector operations and create more commercially viable projects \nfor both ADB and private investors, improve new technologies and innovations in climate financing, \nand open up new areas of business for private sector climate operations.11 This is aligned with \nStrategy 2030, in which ADB is committed to have at least 75% of its operations by number of \nprojects to feature climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.  \n \n12.  Hence, it is imperative that an additional work stream on green finance is included in the \nWFX activities going forward. In line with the core activities of WFX, it will continue to i) support \nfinancial institutions, especially in \u201cgreening their portfolios\u201d or making better informed  credit \ndecisions including green and gender considerations, ii) pilot innovative financing solutions with \na green and gender focus, iii) identify innovative technology solutions promoting green and gender \nbusiness practices, and iv) contribute to creating more awareness and knowledge sharing on \nADB\u2019s work supporting green finance and women. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n \n13.  The TA cluster has the following overall outcome: sustainable financial inclusion for \nwomen and women\u2019s businesses increased and has defined outputs to be delivered by each of \nthe  four  subprojects.  Subproject  4  will  specifically  contribute  to  the  TA  cluster  output  4: \nMaintenance of the WFX, including adding an addition output: Green finance and women, as an \nadditional workstream.  \n \nC.

As indicated and approved in subproject 1, to achieve the objective of an online interactive \nplatform that is frequently used, requires a good understanding of the emerging issues in gender \nresponsive financing, innovative technologies to digitize gender responsive financial services \ndelivery or women\u2019s businesses operating models and identification of other support needs of the \ntarget group (foremost FIs and women\u2019s businesses). This entails moving to a more engaging \napproach which creates interaction between ADB and the target audience in DMCs. During and \npost COVID-19, it will also require a digital approach to interaction and engagement \u2013 including \nusing social media channels such as LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter, or online seminars for \ncapacity building and support for cutting-edge technology.  \n \n15.  During 2021, WFX collected feedback on preferences, trends and audience interests \nwhich further helped to shape WFX\u2019s strategy but also made clear that a more agile interaction \nwith the audience through an interactive website will be necessary. This website, hosted outside \nof adb.org, will be used to interact with different types of audiences, such as FIs, partner/sponsors \nand co-financiers. Feedback loops, including with DOC and ITD colleagues, have supported the \nfinal design of the WFX platform which will go live in Q1 2022. First partnerships with public and \nprivate sector stakeholders and linkages with other initiatives have been identified and are \ncurrently being finalized. One such partnership is with WeFi, the Women Entrepreneurs Finance \nInitiative, which is supporting activities in Viet Nam and the Pacific. \n \n16.  Going forward, output 1 will be the management and expansion of WFX, which includes \nactivities aimed at creating a brand for WFX, promoting and publicizing ADB\u2019s work on access to \nfinance for women and women\u2019s businesses and the platform\u2019s content and activities, maintaining \nthe online platform with interactive features for members, conducting pre-assessment/selection \nwork on FIs to be supported, creating the community for stakeholders to share knowledge and \nexperience, expanding the subscriber base and social media contacts, implementing social media \nmarketing  campaigns,  preparing  and  designing  technical  assistance  activities  to  support \nincreased lending through financial institutions,  and building partnerships with both technical as \nwell as sponsoring and co-financing partners. To support ADB with these activities, resources will \nbe contracted.  \n \nOutput 2: Green finance and Women.  \n \n17.  While adapting business models to the \u201cnew normal\u201d environment and operating more \ndigitally and being gender-responsive is one challenge for FIs, another challenge is to respond to \nthe increasing need to \u201cgreen\u201d their lending activities and also cease financing industries and \nsectors which have large carbon footprints and are exacerbating the effects of climate change. \nGrowing awareness of climate change has led to an increase in the market sentiment amongst \nsome private sector businesses and financial institutions in ADB\u2019s DMCs that businesses need to \nbecome greener, which has been accompanied by certain regulatory actions to support this \ngreening. For example, the EU sustainable finance disclosure regulations, introduced in March \n202112, required for the first time that funds provided information about the ESG risks in their \nportfolios, with the aim to strengthen ESG-compliant financing and improve market discipline \naround the green economy transition. This was followed by the Pan Asia Securities Lending \n \n12  KPMG. 2021.

Introducing  new  digital  financial  services,  specifically  geared  to  enhance  gender \nresponsive financing or applying a gender lens in the investment/credit and at the same time \nincluding  \u201cgreen\u201d  considerations  in  the  credit  or  portfolio  assessment  process  or  product \ndevelopment process will require different approaches and new skillsets for an FI.  Specifically, \nthis  will  require  the  development,  piloting  and  implementation  of  innovative,  scalable,  and \ncommercially viable financial risk management products that incentivize financial institutions to \nincrease investments in climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk prevention with \na focus on WMSMEs. WFX\u2019s partner FIs will be supported through a range of activities, such as \nspecific tailored expert advice, webinars or online toolkits, including green finance assessment \ntools  which  will  support  FIs\u2019  efforts  to  ensure  a  greener  portfolio  as  well  as  risk  sharing \ncomponents which will be developed along with innovative financing structures. FIs will receive \nthe opportunity and support to pilot new technologies or financing structures and products before \nthey can be scaled. \n \n19.   In the short-term, one such activity will be market research, including a mapping exercise \nof existing solutions, and a feasibility study to develop and pilot a green finance assessment tool.14 \nADB is already piloting a gender equality scorecard which enables an investor to evaluate a \ncompany\u2019s actions to support gender equality against country and sector benchmarks. Lessons \nfrom this exercise will be useful for the green finance assessment tool, including consideration of \nthe complementarity As a separate tool with both a gender15 and a green component, the WFX \ngreen finance assessment tool, will be piloted with one or two partner FIs to support integration \nof a green and gender lens in their credit assessments. The tool is expected to be pivotal to \npartner FIs on integrating green and gender components into their MSME business strategy to \ncapture market opportunities and mitigating the risk by making the right credit and developmental \nimpact decisions. \n \n20.  Additionally, WFX will support innovative financing structures, such as the issuance of \nbonds with a green and gender focus through engagements with FIs in target countries with the \ngoal to deepen and expand capital markets in this space, as well as through capacity building \nwith respect to the necessary legal and regulatory environments for expansion and deepening of \nthe markets for green financial products with a gender focus.16 These activities will also be \ninformed by lessons and knowledge from international green or sustainable finance initiatives.17 \nWFX  aims  to  improve  WMSMEs\u2019  access  to  finance  by  developing  financial  products  that \nspecifically target WMSMEs supporting their efforts to create green business products and \nimplement greener business practices. Risk sharing or mitigating components may be developed \nto support the completion of the structures. \n \n \n13  Reuters. 2021.

WFX will also raise awareness and share knowledge through a range of webinars and \npublications, focusing on green finance and gender, with the twin-goals of developing WFX Green \nFinance as a credible platform as well as to educate and inform partner FIs and WMSMEs on \ngreen  finance  and  green  finance  products.  Related  to  this  WFX  will  continue  to  foster \nopportunities for creating a community by partnering with and sharing on initiatives with similar \ngoals, such as for example gender-smart investment working group and the 2x Challenge. \n \nD.
