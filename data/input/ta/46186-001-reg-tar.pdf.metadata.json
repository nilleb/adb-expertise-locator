INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Commitments under the Paris Declaration require development agencies to work with \ndeveloping  countries  to  improve  development  effectiveness.  As  a  signatory  to  the  Paris \nDeclaration, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has undertaken a number of initiatives to \nimprove its assistance and make the national development plans of its developing member \ncountries (DMCs) more effective. One such step was to pilot test the diagnostic approach to \ndevelopment planning in two ADB-financed technical assistance (TA) projects.1 The proposed \ncluster TA builds on work under the earlier TA by extending the depth and breadth of the \nanalytical work and covering a new set of DMCs. A concept paper prepared for the TA was \napproved by the vice-president (knowledge management and sustainable development) on 13 \nAugust 2012.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Country diagnostic studies can enhance national development plans and strategies by \nfocusing  development  efforts  on  the  most  critical  constraints.  Thorough  diagnostics  were \nemphasized  in  Asian  Development  Fund  XI  discussions  as  the  means  to  improve  ADB \noperations\u2019  quality  at  entry.  However,  DMCs  typically  lack  the  awareness  and/or  capacity \nneeded to undertake diagnostics on their own. In particular, capacity for planning and analytical \ncapacity is weak in low-income DMCs, which arguably need diagnostics the most to help \nallocate  their  limited  resources  toward  addressing  the  most  critical  constraints  on  their \neconomies. In light of this, there is a clear need to help DMCs build their capacity and undertake \ncountry diagnostic studies. Looking ahead, country diagnostic studies need to be scaled up to \nbe able to assist more DMCs. \n \n3.  ADB has introduced diagnostic approaches to development planning to DMCs through \nearlier TA projects (footnote 1)3 with the aim of improving DMCs\u2019 capacity to plan, implement, \nand account for results of their development policies and programs.4 Through these TA projects, \nADB  has  worked  with  DMC  governments  and  other  development  partners to  undertake  a \nnumber of country diagnostic studies. These studies incorporated existing frameworks and \npioneered  approaches  to  diagnose  constraints  on  inclusive  growth  and  environmental \nsustainability\u2014two pillars of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.5  \n \n4.  To date, ADB has completed country diagnostic studies, for Indonesia, Nepal, Papua \nNew Guinea, and the Philippines. Studies for Bhutan, Cambodia, the Maldives, and Thailand \nstill continue.6 Findings of these studies have been published through the Critical Development \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007.

Manila (TA 7686-REG). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 August 2012. \n3  The country diagnostic study for Bhutan is being implemented as a subproject under ADB. 2006. Technical \nAssistance for the Development Partnership Program for South Asia. Manila (TA 6337-REG; financed by the \nAustralia\u2013ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility). \n4  The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and other \ndevelopment partners have widely adopted diagnostic approaches.  \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nConstraints series.7 In addition, TA 6397 produced two monographs.8 The studies have been \nwidely  appreciated  by  DMC  governments  and  other  stakeholders,  including  development \npartners, for their approach, findings, and recommendations. In terms of impact, the studies \nhave contributed to the formulation of national medium-term development plans. For example, \nfindings and recommendations from the Philippine study were key inputs into the midterm \nreview of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 2004\u20132010 and the formulation of the \nMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016. Similarly, the studies contributed to \nthe formulation of current medium-term development plans in Indonesia and Nepal. \n \n5.  DMC governments have found reports from country diagnostic studies to be a useful \nbasis for initiating and expanding policy dialogue with development partners, including ADB. For \nexample, findings from country diagnostics studies helped governments and ADB  to focus \ncountry partnership strategies (CPS) for Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines on their most \ncritical constraints. Further, the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines used reports from \ncountry diagnostic studies as the bases for dialogue with the Millennium Challenge Corporation \nof the Government of the United States to secure grant assistance.9 Similarly, development \npartners  used  findings  and  recommendations  from  studies  for  Indonesia,  Nepal,  and  the \nPhilippines to formulate their own partnership and assistance strategies for these DMCs.10 \n \n6.  With this in view, the cluster TA will expand on the work of earlier TA by incorporating \nthe lessons learned so far. The key considerations that have guided design of the cluster TA \ninclude the following: (i) Focusing on process is important when conducting a diagnostic study \nand needs to include ample opportunity for stakeholders to participate in the diagnostic process. \n(ii) Capacity development is more effective when classroom training is augmented with hands-\non training. (iii) Diagnostics should also consider constraints to green growth and knowledge-led \ngrowth  while  taking  into  account  development  issues  such  as  structural  transformation, \ngovernance, institutions, and the political economy. (iv) In addition to economy-wide diagnosis, \ndiagnostics need to focus on priority sectors in an economy. (v) The dissemination of diagnostic \napproaches needs to be strengthened, especially in countries not selected for diagnostic studies.  \nMoreover, learning from the previous experience, the TA adopts a cluster modality, which \nprovides an opportunity to cater to the large expressed and potential demand from DMCs for the \ncountry  diagnostics  over  a  longer  period  of  time  without  tying  down  entire  TA  resource \nrequirements at the onset. Cluster modality will also allow for TA to be more responsive to the \nneeds  and  timing  of the  DMCs\u2019  planning  cycles  and  ADB\u2019s  CPSs for  these  DMCs,  while \nreducing costs otherwise devoted for processing individual subprojects as standalone TAs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be the mainstreaming of diagnostic approaches in the development \nplanning processes of DMCs. The outcome will be DMCs\u2019 medium-term development plans, \n                                                \n7  Various study reports prepared under ADB TA for Strengthening Country Diagnosis and Analysis of Binding \nDevelopment Constraints in Selected Developing Member Countries (footnote 1)..  \n8  D.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Cluster Technical Assistance \n \n8.  The cluster TA will have four subprojects, each including the introduction of diagnostic \napproaches to development planning and the conduct of country diagnostic studies in 2\u20134 \nDMCs. DMC selection is in consultation with DMC governments and ADB regional departments. \nIdeally, the studies will be timed to inform the formulation and implementation of the selected \nDMCs\u2019 medium-term development plans. The general criteria for selection will be (i) the DMC\u2019s \nweak analytical and planning capacity; (ii) the study\u2019s ability to inform the formulation and/or \nimplementation of the DMC\u2019s medium-term development plan; (iii) the DMC\u2019s keen interest in \nthe study; and (iv) the likelihood of the study generating a demonstration effect. In consultation \nwith ADB regional departments, Bangladesh, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Solomon Islands, \nSri  Lanka,  Tajikistan,  and  Timor-Leste  have  been  identified  for  inclusion  in  the  first  three \nsubprojects.11  \n \n2.  Subproject 1 \n \n9.  Subproject 1 will cover three DMCs\u2014Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste\u2014and has \ntwo main components: (i) conducting country diagnostic studies and (ii) capacity building and \ndissemination. \n \na.  Conducting Country Diagnostic Studies \n \n10.  Three country studies will diagnose critical constraints on rapid and inclusive economic \ngrowth with special consideration for green and knowledge-led growth in the selected DMCs \nusing (i) growth diagnostic frameworks; (ii) diagnostic frameworks for constraints on reducing \npoverty  and  inequality;  (iii)  diagnostic  frameworks  for  employment  and  labor  markets;  (iv) \nproduct space analysis; and (v) diagnostic frameworks for the governance, institutional, and \npolitical economy dimensions of development constraints.  \n \n11.  Individual country diagnostic studies will be undertaken over 12\u201318 months in three \nsteps: (i) review development performance and patterns, (ii) conduct an overarching diagnosis \nof constraints on rapid and inclusive economic growth, and (iii) conduct in-depth diagnoses of \nthe areas identified by the overarching diagnosis including sector and thematic assessments. \nThe studies will be interactive, conducting two or three workshops to inform and consult with \nstakeholders on study approaches, findings, and proposed policy options. Studies will also use \nand build on any recent or ongoing studies or capacity building initiatives by governments, their \ndevelopment partners including ADB, and any other institutions to bring out concrete policy \nsuggestions to address the constraints.  \n \nb.  Capacity Building and Dissemination \n \n12.  The component will create awareness of and capacity in diagnostic approaches in DMCs\u2019 \ngovernmental planning agencies, ministries, and departments, as well as in research institutions \nand nongovernment organizations. It will include training and advanced training workshops, and \ndissemination workshops in-country and regional.  \n \n                                                \n11 ADB will obtain a no-objection letter from each selected DMC. \n ", "4   \n13.  Training workshops will ideally be conducted in the initial stage of an individual study to \nenable participating agencies and individuals to actively contribute to conducting the studies. \nTraining workshops spanning 2\u20133 days will cover the basics of diagnostic frameworks using \nlectures, case studies, and group work. Advanced training workshops will be undertaken at the \ncompletion of overarching diagnoses and provide training in sector or theme diagnostics. The \ntiming of training workshops will be coordinated, where possible, with other capability-building \ninitiatives of ADB\u2019s regional departments, especially those related to diagnostics. \n \n14.  Each  of  the  diagnostic  studies  will  include  activities  to  disseminate  diagnostic \napproaches  and  study  findings,  including  workshops  and  the  use  of  print,  broadcast,  and \ninternet media. The workshops will target key stakeholders including government agencies, civil \nsociety, the private sector, academic and research institutions, and development partners. \n \n15.  Moreover, the  subproject  will  organize  a  regional  conference for  DMC  officials  and \ndevelopment partners that will provide a venue to showcase ADB\u2019s experiences with diagnostic \napproaches and to learn from the experiences of other development partners.  \n \n16.  In addition, the subproject will use country diagnostics study websites to disseminate \ninformation on diagnostic approaches, as well as the findings and recommendations of the \nstudies. It will further reproduce and disseminate existing publications on diagnostic approaches \nand completed country diagnostic studies. \n \n3.  Subsequent Subprojects (Subprojects 2\u20134)12 \n \n17.  Subsequent subprojects will be structured along the lines of subproject 1. Subprojects \n2\u20134 will also have two components: (i) country diagnostic studies and (ii) capacity building and \ndissemination. The design of subprojects 2\u20134 is envisaged benefiting from the lessons from \nimplementing subproject 1.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cluster TA is estimated to cost $6 million equivalent. It will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Subproject 1 is estimated to cost \n$1,450,000. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB, through the Economics and Research Department (ERD), will be the executing \nagency. However, regional departments, resident mission, and subregional offices will be the \nconduits through which ERD coordinates the studies with DMC governments. The TA will be \nimplemented in coordination with ADB regional departments and planning agencies and/or the \nrelevant ministries of DMCs from December 2012 to December 2018.  \n \n20.  The TA will require the services of a number of international and national experts, \nincluding  development  economists,  sector  specialists,  editors,  and  research  assistants. \nHowever, the exact requirements for each type of expertise and the length of input will vary \namong DMCs, to be determined after the initial diagnostic of the DMC economy in question is \ncompleted. For costing purposes, experience from completed and ongoing country diagnostic \n                                                \n12 Subsequent sub-projects will be approved in accordance with OM Section D12/OP (2011), which requires that \napproval be through a memorandum to the head of the department or office, which outlining the (i) overall progress \nof the TA cluster to date; (ii) outcome, and intended outputs of the subproject; (iii) cost estimates and budget; (iv) \nimplementation arrangements; (v) implementation schedule, (vi) terms of reference of consultants; and (vii) other \naspects, as appropriate. In addition, the proposal will require a draft DMF and will be subject to consultations with \ndepartments and/or offices concerned before submission to the head of the department or office for approval. \n ", "  5 \nstudies,  and  the  requirement  to  expand  diagnostics  to  cover  additional  dimensions,  have \nindicated consulting services requirements. Requirements for subproject 1 are estimated at \nabout 48 person-months of international and 24 person-months of national consulting services. \nIn addition, each country diagnostic study in the subproject will require the services of research \nassistants as needed. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.    Given the limitations outlined above, intermittent nature of assignments, and anticipated \nvariety of expertise required, the TA will primarily recruit experts individually, in accordance with \nADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  ADB will procure computers and software in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be coordinated with ADB\u2019s Office of \nInformation  Systems  and  Technology  and  its  Office  of  Administrative  Services.  Upon  TA \ncompletion,  procured  equipment  will  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  the  project \nadministration instruction on administering grant-financed TA projects.13 Disbursements under \nthe  TA  will  accord  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n23.  DMCs for the individual studies will be selected in consultation with DMC governments \nand regional departments. Once an individual study commences, the study team will collaborate \nclosely with governmental planning and finance ministries and statistics and other agencies, as \nwell  as  with  research  institutions  and  universities.  Each  study  will  include  a  number  of \nconsultations to ensure the participation of other stakeholders such as civil society, private \nsector organizations, researchers, and academics. Inputs from governments in selected DMCs \nwill include relevant background materials and data. In addition, governments will be expected \nto designate agencies and/or staff as focal points to help coordinate activities with government \nagencies to support the consolidation of inputs from various agencies, finalization of studies, \nand organization of dissemination workshops.  \n \n24.  Experience from earlier TA projects has clearly demonstrated usefulness of collaboration \nwith development partners, globally reputable research institutions and centers of excellence \ntoward building knowledge partnerships and consensus on development directions. Earlier TA \nprojects showcased successful collaboration with development partners in conduct of study \nwhere each collaborating development partner used its own resources to deliver a particular \naspect of the study based on agreed timelines, and approach that the TA will continue. In \naddition, the TA will partner with in-country development research centers and with global \ncenters of excellence such as the International Growth Centre and the John F. Kennedy School \nof  Government.  Various  forms  of  collaboration  will  be  considered  for  such  partnerships, \nincluding exchange of knowledge, participation of resource persons in training and consultation \nworkshops, and contribution of background papers by their researchers toward the studies. The \nTA will shoulder the cost of collaboration, such as resource persons and consultants.  \n \n25.  ERD will report on the progress of the TA and of individual studies through established \nproject performance management systems.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n26.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $6,000,000 on a grant basis for Country Diagnostic Studies in \nSelected Developing Member Countries. \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2009.
