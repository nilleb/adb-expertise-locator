INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfor advisory support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment. The TA is included in the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 20211. \nThe TA will provide innovative, flexible, and timely knowledge products, advisory services, and \ncapacity development support to the government to enable it to respond effectively to policy and \ncapacity development needs associated with the recovery from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \nand the country\u2019s emerging development challenges.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  COVID-19 has caused a deep economic contraction, slowed progress on macroeconomic \nreform, and exacerbated underlying inequalities in Mongolia. The pandemic caused a contraction \nin overall gross domestic product (GDP) of 5.3% in 2020. This increased the debt\u2013GDP ratio by \n14.1 percentage points and resulted in a stagnation of credit while elevating long-standing risks \nin the finance sector linked to nonperforming loans and weak capital buffers. The COVID-19-\ninduced contraction has led to job losses in all major sectors and increased unemployment and \nunderemployment.3 In addition to the 28.4% of people who live in poverty,3 a further 27.3% of \nMongolians were living just above the poverty line in 2018.4 Groups that suffered from higher \npoverty before the COVID-19 pandemic, such as women, youth, people with disabilities, younger \nadults (aged 30\u201339), and rural populations, have been worst hit by COVID-19 with higher job \nlosses and a more significant loss of services such as education.5 \n \n3.  Historically, frequent shifts at the political level have been accompanied by widespread \nchanges in the civil service, presenting a challenge for policy continuity. Reforms are underway \nto address this issue systematically through constitutional amendments, a new Civil Service Law, \nand a civil service reform program supported by the Government of Canada and the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP). ADB is also supporting reform of the government\u2019s \ndevelopment policy regulations to strengthen continuity at the project level. Another source of \nvolatility for Mongolia is economic linked to the country\u2019s dependence on mining, which leaves it \nvulnerable to fluctuations in commodity markets.  \n \n4.  In  addition  to  reducing  this  historical  volatility,  Mongolia  has  outlined  an  ambitious \nGovernment  Action  Plan  (GAP),  2020-2024 6  to  deliver  more  inclusive  and  sustainable \ndevelopment. Mongolia also aims to make major policy transitions in many sectors to deliver its \nVision 2050,7 which strives to expand the middle class underpinned by a modern, inclusive, and \ngreen economy. Successfully fulfilling this ambition will require shifts in approach in areas such \nas macroeconomics, gender equality, energy, agriculture, finance, infrastructure, tourism, green \ndevelopment, and technology. As a small, open economy in an economically dynamic region, \nMongolia must innovate and adapt quickly to capitalize on its potential. Achieving these policy \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2021. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 July 2021. \n3  National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2021.

Ulaanbaatar.  \n ", "2 \n \nshifts and adapting quickly will require policy advice and capacity building across a range of areas \nto help deliver more inclusive and sustainable development.  \n \n5.  In 2016, ADB approved TA to Mongolia for Macroeconomic Advisory Support to help the \ngovernment respond to the macroeconomic challenges.8 This allowed the government and ADB \nto identify and address emerging, urgent, and/or innovative challenges. Activities facilitated \nimportant progress in key areas such as removing Mongolia from the Financial Action Task \nForce\u2019s  Anti-Money  Laundering/Combating  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  grey  list,  deepening \nexpertise in economic modeling with the Bank of Mongolia (the central bank) and introducing \ninnovations including Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) budgeting in partnership with the \nUnited Nations. The TA for Supporting Inclusive and Sustainable Development is designed to \nprovide continued support to the government to address and respond to emerging challenges \nlinked to Mongolia\u2019s vulnerability to economic shocks and disasters triggered by natural hazards, \nwhile progressing to achieve the SDGs and the national development agenda. This vulnerability \nhas been accentuated by the COVID-19 crisis. \n \n6.  The TA will help Mongolia respond to emerging development challenges arising from the \nfluid environment described in paras. 2\u20135. The TA will help the government consolidate the \nimprovements in their management of economic volatility observed in recent years. It will mobilize \nknowledge solutions, advisory services, and capacity development to support the resolution of \ndevelopment challenges and/or deepen government capacity in core areas. TA implementation \nwill be done in close coordination with ADB loans, grants, and TAs with activities in Mongolia. \nADB will also coordinate closely with other development partners and improving development \npartner coordination is one of the planned activities under the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: inclusive and sustainable implementation of \nthe GAP, 2020\u20132024 achieved. The TA will have the following outcome: policies and measures \nto implement the GAP, 2020\u20132024 and the SDGs improved.10 This outcome will be achieved \nthrough the delivery of two outputs: policy advice on inclusive and sustainable development \nprovided, and knowledge and skills in public sector management of government staff enhanced. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Policy advice on inclusive and sustainable development provided. The TA \nwill provide government agencies with advisory services in areas that will contribute to more \ninclusive and sustainable development in Mongolia. All activities will be closely aligned with the \nGAP, 2020\u20132024 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for Mongolia, 2021\u20132024.9 \nActivities  will  include  preparing  knowledge  products  and  providing  policy  advice  through \norganizing conferences, seminars, and workshops on international good practices. The TA will \nsupport the government to formulate improved policies and plans to deliver on the GAP, 2020-\n2024 and to deliver the SDGs. The activities will support improved public financial management \nincluding enhancing gender-based budgeting in the health sector, improving the use of tax policy \nas a social protection measure and strengthening core public financial management functions \n \n8  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Macroeconomic Advisory Support. Manila.  \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9 ADB. 2021. Mongolia, 2021\u20132024: Laying Resilient Foundations for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth. Manila.  \n ", "3 \n \nincluding  revenue  projections  and  options  appraisal.  The  activities  will  also  improve  the \ninvestment climate by addressing emerging challenges faced by Mongolia in attracting private \nsector investment including finance sector reform, public\u2013private partnerships, and marketing \nMongolia as an investment destination. The activities will support continuous identification and \napplication of good practice in responding to the evolving COVID-19 situation, including planning \nin the health sector, but also in other affected sectors such as education, agriculture, trade, \nservices, and business (particularly micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises) more generally. \nSome activities will focus on the use and application of new technologies such as carbon \nabatement technologies to combat climate change or information technology to broaden internet \naccess. Activities will also support the review and assessment of high potential opportunities to \nsupport inclusive and sustainable development in Mongolia, for example exploring the potential \nof the rare earth materials sector in Mongolia or providing advisory support to the authorities in \nother export potential sectors. \n \n9.  Output 2: Knowledge and skills in public sector management of government staff \nenhanced. This output will strengthen the development and management capacity of government \nagencies  through  organizational  diagnostics,  capacity  assessments,  training  programs, \nworkshops,  conferences,  and  knowledge  management  interventions.  As  with  output  1,  all \nactivities will be closely aligned with the GAP, 2020\u20132024 and ADB\u2019s CPS for Mongolia, 2021\u2013\n2024.  The  activities  will  include  training  and  hands-on  support  for  government  officials  to \nstrengthen policy formulation, policy and project preparation, implementation and evaluation, and \ndevelopment partner coordination. The activities will deepen the capacity of government staff to \nappraise legislation, policies, and projects, including their macroeconomic and socio-economic \nimpacts. The activities will also support enhanced capacity on data collection, management, and \nuse, including in innovative areas such as big data and artificial intelligence and their application \nto government service functions such as civil registration, audit, traffic and border management, \nand other areas.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000, of which $1,250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, logistics and administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA through the Mongolia Resident Mission. The TA will be \nimplemented from December 2021 to 15 January 2025. TA support for workshops may include \ncosts  related  to  the  venue,  equipment  rental,  translation,  printing  and  copying,  food  and \nnonalcoholic beverages, transportation, lodging, logistics and administrative support, and other \nagreed expenditures with prior written approval from ADB. Disbursements under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended time \nto time). The TA may also fund surveys, field investigations, and the purchase of required \nresource  materials,  based  on  cost  estimates  agreed  by  ADB.  In  line  with  standard  ADB \nprocedures, the TA will not support implementing agencies\u2019 management fees, overhead, or \nrelated costs such as staff salaries and allowances, or the use of implementing agencies\u2019 \nresources (such as office accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart \ncontribution.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB \n \n ", "4 \n \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n \n13.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  with  responsibility  for \noversight and coordination of the activities, to ensure strong coordination with other government \nagencies. Other benefitting agencies are expected to include the Bank of Mongolia, the National \nDevelopment Agency, the National Statistics Office, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor \nand  Social  Protection  and  others.  Support  for  these  agencies  will  be  coordinated  and \nimplemented through MOF. ADB will assist the executing agency in overall TA operations and \nwill conduct TA review missions to help monitor progress. ADB will be responsible for the \nrecruitment and contracting of all consultants in coordination with the executing agency. The TA \nwill establish a project implementation unit (PIU) consisting of a part-time TA coordinator and a \npart-time financial and administrative assistant for day-to-day administration. The PIU will be \nresponsible for producing the TA outputs and products in a timely and effective manner, and for \norganizing and carrying out all TA activities. The PIU will report to the ADB project officer.  \n \n14.  To facilitate TA implementation, the PIU will establish a separate advance payment facility \nwith the MOF in a commercial bank in United States dollars in coordination with the MOF following \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). This \nwill be used to support cash expenditures for workshops, training programs, conferences, survey \ncosts, publishing of reports, and other miscellaneous administration and support costs with prior \nagreement from ADB. The TA will not support expenditures that are not reflected in ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  guidelines.11  The  executing  agency  is  assessed  as  having  the  financial \nmanagement capacity and internal control to maintain records.12 ADB will also make certain direct \npayments to service providers (e.g., for equipment and workshop venues). \n \n15.

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.13 The TA will engage about 30 person-months of international consulting \nservices; 250 person-months of national consulting services; 20 resource persons for workshops, \nseminars, and policy briefs and notes. ADB will engage UNDP through single source selection to \nsupport  delivery  of  outputs  1  and  2,  in  particular  to  undertake  activities  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  SDGs.  UNDP  can  leverage  its  presence  in  Mongolia  to  ensure \nimplementation  efficiency,  well-coordinated  activities,  and  output  sustainability.  UNDP\u2019s \nengagement is in line with the agreed areas of collaboration and forms of cooperation set out in \nthe  memorandum  of  understanding  between  ADB  and  UNDP  dated  13  April  2019.  The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  initially  for  12  person-months  with  a  view  to  extending  their \nengagement if both parties are satisfied. The TA coordinator and financial and administrative \nassistant will be intermittent positions of 24 person-months each to oversee TA implementation \nand ensure high-quality communication of results, strong coordination between the activities, and \nsupport across all TA outputs.  \n \n17.  Financial management. ADB has conducted a financial management assessment of the \nMOF linked to the establishment of the advance payment facility. The assessment confirms the \nMOF\u2019s capacity to manage the funds and has identified no major issues. \n \n18.  Financial management action plan. The financial management assessment proposes \nan action plan that includes (i) hiring qualified financial and administrative assistants, (ii) providing \ntraining on TA disbursement processes and requirements, (iii) providing financial guidance to the \nexecuting and implementing agency, and (iv) conducting regular reviews and monitoring of the \nfinancial management risks. \n \nIV.
