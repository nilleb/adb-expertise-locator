It also operates \ninefficiently and at a loss. To overcome these shortcomings the Government of Cambodia \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide support for physical rehabilitation of \nthe railway\u2019s infrastructure and for restructuring the railway inclusive of establishing a public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) to operate the railway in the future. The purpose is to achieve efficient \nrail freight traffic and reconnect the railway in Cambodia with the railway in Thailand. The \nrehabilitation investment and the associated restructuring will together set the stage for efficient \nrail freight services, which in turn realizes the project's objectives: (i) improving the transport \nsector's efficiency by increasing the diversity of transport modes and routes, and (ii) resurrecting \nthe railway on a sustainable basis. \n2.  This  advisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)1  assists  with  restructuring  of  the  railway \nsubsector and establishing a new PPP to operate the railway. The ADTA is associated with a \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for preparing of a project to rehabilitate the \nrailway infrastructure. \n3.  Turnaround exercises for state-owned railways, involving partial spin-off, have been \nperformed elsewhere, but the model has not been tested in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and \nwill therefore be studied with substantial interest by the neighboring countries as a possible \nmodel for revitalizing of their railway sectors. In Cambodia, the project represents a first attempt \nat spinning off public service provision in a fully transparent and competitive manner, with the \nconcurrent establishment of a proper regulatory framework. Thus, the project is expected to \nillustrate the advantages of transparency: reduced public concerns, better and more economic \nservice provision, and maximized revenue streams for the Government. As such, the project will \nserve as a useful model for future establishment of PPPs in Cambodia. \n4.  The Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study (CTSSS)2, which was completed in \nDecember 2002, concluded that a rehabilitated railway would be economically beneficial to \nCambodia and could possibly become a profitable operation. The strategy study recommended \nfurther evaluation of the case for rehabilitating of the railway. In May 2003, a Reconnaissance \nMission from ADB visited Cambodia and Thailand to review the possibilities for rehabilitating the \nrailway in Cambodia and reestablishing its connection with the railway in Thailand. The ADB \nMission found that rehabilitation of the railway would be realistic and relevant, provided the \nrailway was restructured. \n5.  During  the  country  programming  mission  in  2003,  the  Government  requested  the \ninclusion of a loan for restructuring and rehabilitation of the railway and an associated grant-\nfinanced technical assistance (TA) in ADB\u2019s 2004 country strategy and plan update. Two small-\nscale TA studies were undertaken in October 2003 to further assess and confirm the likely \npotential demand for improved railway services and the railway\u2019s business opportunities. The \nmarket study confirmed substantial potential demand, especially if the route to Thailand is \nreopened3. It also confirmed that improved rail transport would generate substantial economic \nbenefits from reduced future transport cost and road maintenance cost by diverting heavy goods \ntraffic away from the road network. The business opportunity study confirmed that the railway \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 7 April 2005. \n2 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Transport Sector Strategy. Manila (TA 3651, \napproved on 27 April 2001 for $850,000). \n3 The connection with Thailand was destroyed during the 1970s. \n ", "2   \nwould become profitable, provided investments are limited to those necessary to enable efficient \nfreight traffic and reconnect the railway with Thailand. The study recommended restructuring the \nrailway to enable private sector investment to reduce the requirements for government-financed \ncapital expenditure. The study documented that there are private investors who are interested in \nthe proposed venture. \n6.  In June 2004, the Government and ADB agreed on the broad approach to development \nof  a  project  for  restructuring  and  rehabilitating  the  railway.  Restructuring  would  involve \nestablishing a PPP with the Government as minority shareholder to take over future railway \noperations and creating of an independent regulatory authority. Rehabilitation would restore the \nrailway\u2019s  fixed  infrastructure.  The  infrastructure  and  all  land  would  remain  in  government \nownership. On 9\u201311 March 2005, an ADB TA Fact-Finding Mission reached an understanding \nwith the Government on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, and costs for the \nADTA  required  to  prepare  the  restructuring  component  of  the  proposed  project.  The \nunderstanding was recorded in an aide memoire that was subsequently confirmed in a letter \nfrom the Minister of Public Works and Transport, dated 31 March 2005. \nII.  ISSUES \n7.  The CTSSS concluded that the railway in Cambodia is worn-out and requires extensive \nphysical  and  institutional  rehabilitation  to  regain  financial  and  technical  sustainability.  The \nrailway is currently incurring losses, and neither the Government nor the railway can finance \nrehabilitation from its resources. \n8.  Cambodia's transport system is economically inefficient due to limited choice of routes \nand modes of transport, which severely limits the scope for optimizing logistics, and permits the \nformation of cartels by transport providers and the exploitation of natural monopolies by private \nand public owners and operators of infrastructure. The enabling environment for these market \nfailures is the physical and regulatory barriers4 that reduce the diversity of routes and modes \navailable\u2500often  to  only  a  single  realistic  choice\u2500and  effectively  lock  transport  buyers  into \ninefficient or overpriced services for lack of alternatives. As a result of these inefficiencies, as \nwell as others that are not transport related, staple commodities on which the poor rely are \nsignificantly more expensive in Cambodia than in the neighboring countries, and Cambodia\u2019s \nnascent export industries\u2014garments and tourism, which are the prime generators of new jobs \nand  foreign  currency\u2014are  threatened  because  their  international  competitiveness  is  being \nundermined  by  formal  and  informal  transaction  costs,  inclusive  of  overpriced  or  inefficient \ndomestic transport services. The scope for further diversifying the economy into other sectors \nsuch as agro-industry and assembly is correspondingly diminished. \n9.  The market study undertaken in October 2003 showed that widening the diversity of \ntransport services and the number of external linkages would provide transport users with \nalternatives to overpriced services and increase the inherent economic efficiency of transport \nsupply by providing a broader spectrum of routes and modes. This would allow transport users \nto better tailor logistic solutions to their needs. For example, consumer prices for liquefied \npetroleum  gas  (LPG),  which  is  used  for  cooking  in  households,  are  about  65%  higher  in \nCambodia than in Thailand partly because LPG at present cannot be imported in bulk. \n                                                 \n4  Examples are the missing railway connection to Thailand, which was dismantled in the 1970s; and the ban on \ntrucks crossing Cambodia\u2019s borders, which means that all trade across the land borders must be offloaded and \nmoved by pushcart before being reloaded on the other side. \n ", "  3\n10.  The proposed project aims to reduce consumer prices and increase the growth potential \nof  Cambodia's  economy  by  increasing  the  inherent  efficiency  of  domestic  transport  and \nreducing the barriers that sustain monopoly pricing in the transport sector. The proposed project \nwill also have immediate subregional impact by relinking the railway in Cambodia with the \nrailway in Thailand and, then, with the network in Malaysia and Singapore. Looking further \nforward, connecting this greater network with the existing railway network in Viet Nam, and \nthrough it to the network in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), will provide a rail-based \ntransport corridor between Singapore and the PRC. The economic potential for such a corridor, \nwhich would require a new rail link between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam, is \npresently under study.  \n11.  The Government of Cambodia has previously invited private sector participation in the \nprovision of transport infrastructure and services. Successful examples are the toll-financed \nroad maintenance concession for National Road 4 and the concession for developing and \noperating the country's two international airports: Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. But there have \nalso been failures due to inadequate regulatory oversight, such as the Cambodia Ship Registry. \nFurthermore, the process of concessioning in Cambodia is regarded with suspicion in many \nquarters because concessions in the past had been allotted in an opaque and noncompetitive \nmanner. An important aspect of this TA is to overcome these shortcomings by establishing an \nadequate regulatory and contractual framework for the concession, and employing transparent \nand competitive bidding procedures to appoint the concessionaire. The process will serve as a \nmodel of best practice for future concessions in the country. \n12.  Potential  issues  that  will  need  to  be  addressed  during  the  ADTA  include  staff \nredundancy and the future of the existing passenger rail service. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The goals of the project are to support economic growth by improving Cambodia's \ninternational competitiveness, and support poverty reduction by reducing the cost of living. The \npurposes of the project are to (i) increase the efficiency of the transport sector at large by \nincreasing the competitiveness of the railway; (ii) secure the long-term sustainability of the \nrailway sector; and (iii) reduce road damage and road traffic risks associated with the movement \nof heavy and dangerous goods. The project will achieve these goals by restructuring the railway \nand establishing a new PPP railway operator to provide efficient freight transport services on the \nrestored railway infrastructure, inclusive of direct services to Thailand and the container port in \nSihanoukville.  \n14.  The  outcome  of  the  ADTA  will  be  a  restructured  railway  in  Cambodia,  possibly \nencompassing these entities: (i) a depository authority holding the railway's land and fixed \ninfrastructure, which will remain government property; (ii) an independent transport regulator, \ninitially providing regulatory oversight for the railway but designed to expand its coverage to \nother modes of transport at a later stage; (iii) a PPP-based commercial railway operator to run \nthe  railway\u2019s  freight  operations;  and  (iv)  an  entity,  to  be  defined,  to  operate  the  railway\u2019s \npassenger services. The railway operator will be established as a joint venture between a \nselected  consortium  of  private  investors  and  the  Government  of  Cambodia  as  a  minority \nshareholder. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The project will engage an international firm of institutional and transaction advisory \nconsultants in association with domestic consultants to assist the Government with restructuring \nthe railway. Emphasis will be on transparency at all stages of the process, establishment of a \ntransparent and efficient regulatory environment, implementation of proper handling of staff \nretention and replacement, and selection of an efficient PPP consortium to undertake future \noperation of the railway. Emphasis is also given to public information and to documenting the \nprocess and disseminating the documentation so that it can serve as best practice for future \nspin-offs. \n16.  The key activities of the ADTA are to (i) plan and prepare the restructuring of the railway \nsector for freight and passenger operations; (ii) execute the formation of a PPP railway operator \nfor  the  railway\u2019s  freight  operations  based  on  international  competitive  bidding  between \ninterested private sector consortia; (iii) advise the Government on options for operating the \nrailway\u2019s passenger service; (iv) advise the Government on the choice of depository authority \nfor the Government's holdings of land and infrastructure used by the railway; (v) advise the \nGovernment on the best way of establishing regulatory oversight of the railway sector in terms \nof a regulatory regime, the scope of regulation, and the structure of the regulator; (vi) provide \nassistance in establishing the transport regulator and the depository authority; (vii) advise the \nGovernment on how best to handle staff retrenchment in a transparent and fair manner; and \n(viii) document the process in sufficient detail to allow for future repetition elsewhere. The \ndesign and monitoring matrix is in Appendix 1. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the ADTA is estimated at $2,143,000 equivalent comprising $1,670,000 \nin foreign exchange and $473,000 in local currency equivalent. ADB will provide $1,352,000 \n(81%) of the foreign exchange cost and $148,000 equivalent (31%) of the local currency cost. \nThe ADTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of France and administered by \nADB.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  finance  local  currency  expenditures  of  $300,000 \nequivalent in kind and the successful bidder for the concession as railway operator is required to \nfinance  the  transaction  advisor's  profit  upon  closure  of  contract  (fee  plus  success  bonus \nremuneration) in the amount of $343,000 equivalent. The payment is a bonus payment by the \nPPP  operator  under  the  PPP  contract.  ADB\u2019s  standard  procurement  contract  may  need \nmodification to enable the success bonus payment model. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport will be the executing agency. The ADTA will \nbe implemented by a consultant engaged by ADB to advise the Government on restructuring of \nthe railway sector (institutional adviser) and provide advisory services for the establishment of \nthe PPP railway operator (transaction adviser). The restructuring ADTA will be executed over 25 \nmonths from August 2005 to September 2007 and will require 57 person-months of expert input \nin the fields of law, financing, contracts, institutions, traffic and financial planning, and staff \ndevelopment and training. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultancy will be \nexecuted by an international consulting firm with substantial experience in railway restructuring, \nin association with domestic consultants. The consultants will be engaged by ADB though \nquality- and cost-based selection using a simplified technical proposal. Procurement will be in \n ", "  5\naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n19.  The project is the first railway restructuring with PPP involvement to be executed in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion. The documentation produced and the approaches adopted in the \nADTA can form the starting point for similar future exercises in Cambodia and elsewhere. To \nfacilitate this, the project will produce a tool kit describing the procedural steps, information \ncollected, and analysis performed in the course of executing the transaction advisory. The tool \nkit will also contain samples of the documentation produced during TA implementation. A similar \ntool kit will be produced for the institutional advisory associated with setting up the regulatory \nauthority.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to the Government of Cambodia to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of France for the Restructuring of the Railway in \nCambodia. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nThe institutional  The railway is efficiently  Project completion reports  \u2022  The railway is \narrangements created will  operated and effectively  Railway accounts  rehabilitated. \nallow profitable, long-term  regulated.

Introduction \n1.  The Government of Cambodia intends to restructure its railway. The option considered is \nestablishment of an independent railway regulator (the regulator), a railway operator company \n(the operator) established as a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) with the Government as a \nminority  shareholder,  to  operate  the  railway\u2019s  freight  services,  and,  if  desired  by  the \nGovernment, an agency, to be defined, to operate the railway\u2019s passenger service. Advice to \nthe Government on these matters will be provided through the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-\nfinanced advisory technical assistance (ADTA) to be implemented in accordance with these \nterms  of  reference.  As  part  of  the  restructuring,  the  Government  plans  to  rehabilitate  the \nrailway\u2019s  infrastructure  with  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  for  which \npurpose a separate ADB-financed project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) will run in \nparallel to this ADTA, and be linked to it. Rehabilitation of the infrastructure will be completed in \n2008. To implement structural reform in the railway sector, and facilitate the establishment of \nthe railway operator, the Government desires to procure a consortium of advisers to advise and \nassist it in all aspects of the restructuring process and to act as transaction advisor during the \nestablishment of the railway operator. \nB.  Objective \n2.  The objective of the assignment is to advise and assist the Government with all aspects \nof restructuring the railway and the successful creation and launch of the railway operator as a \nPPP. The transaction advisor will be required to undertake the following tasks: \n(i)  Advise the Government on ways and means of implementing structural reform of \nthe railway sector as outlined above and regulated by applicable laws. \n(ii)  Advise  the  Government  on  the  restructuring  of  the  railways  sector  and  its \norganization  to  facilitate  the  formation  of  the  regulator  and  the  operator,  and \nprepare the associated activities. \n(iii)  Advise  the  Government  on  options  for  the  railway\u2019s  passenger  operations, \nincluding a study of subsidies, if required, at fare levels related to passengers\u2019 \nability to pay. \n(iv)  Advise and assist the Government in implementing of all activities related to the \nestablishment and launch of the railway operator. \n3.  The work to be undertaken has, conceptually, been divided into six phases: preparation, \nreform and restructuring, marketing, prequalification, bidding and selection of private sector \ninvestor, and post-transaction. Prequalification and bidding and selection of a private sector \ninvestor will be carried out in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and international \nbest practice. Detailed terms of reference and the schedule for executing of the assignment are \ndescribed in the following paragraphs. \nC.  Detailed Tasks \n1.  Preparation Phase \n4.  The transaction advisor will assemble and review all information, documentation, and \ndata relating to the railway sector, and its potential. With this information, the transaction advisor \nwill carry out the following: \n(i)  Carry out asset, financial, and legal due diligence of the railway conditions. \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(ii)  Project the traffic demand, revenue, and operational cost for the railway up to \n2030, and make the outcome available to the rehabilitation PPTA consultants to \nform a common basis for design of the restructuring and the rehabilitation projects. \n(iii)  Prepare financial forecast (annual profit statement and balance sheet) for the \nrailway,  covering  at  least  the  construction  phase  where  the  railway  is  being \nrehabilitated,  and  the  first  10  years  after  completion  of  construction.  Execute \nsensitivity analysis reflecting all identified risks and uncertainties. Two cases will \nbe considered: freight traffic only and freight traffic as well as minimal passenger \ntraffic. \n(iv)  Review  the  completeness  and  adequacy  of  the  existing  policy,  legal,  and \nregulatory framework and recommend changes to facilitate restructuring of the \nrailway. \n(v)  Assist the Government with review and renegotiation of the railway cross-border \nagreement with Thailand, which was established in 1955. \n(vi)  Determine  future  investment  requirements  of  the  railway  network  and  identify \npossible sources of funding. \n(vii)  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  preceding  activities,  the  transaction  advisor  will \nprepare a strategy and a time-bound action plan for structural reform of the railway \ninclusive of contingency plans should it become apparent during the restructuring \nprocess that some or parts of the envisaged restructuring are impractical. The \nstrategy  will  also  include  plans  for  retraining,  replacing,  or  compensating  of \naffected  staff  in  case  of  staff  redundancy,  and  for  managing  the  railway\u2019s \npassenger operations. \n2.  Reform and Restructuring Phase \n5.  Upon government approval of the strategy and action plan for reform of the railway \nsector and restructuring of the railway, the advisors facilitate implementation of sector reforms \nand develop and establish the intended structures for the railway sector. The two activities will \nbe handled concurrently. The advisors will undertake these tasks: \n(i)  Assist the Government in carrying out structural reform of the railway sector. \n(ii)  Assist the Government with restructuring the railway and advise the Government \non the arrangements for a concession to operate the railway\u2019s freight operations. \nThe  transaction  advisor  will  implement  the  approved  restructuring  strategy \naccording to the time-bound action plan. \n(iii)  Advise the Government on the best ways of handling staff redundancies in a fair \nand transparent manner, and develop an action plan. \n(iv)  Advise the Government on suitable options for managing the railway\u2019s passenger \nservice. \n3.
