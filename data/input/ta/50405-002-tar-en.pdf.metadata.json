INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will facilitate demand for local \ncurrency-denominated (LCY) bonds in members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (collectively \nknown as ASEAN+3).1 The TA aims to strengthen information dissemination and raise awareness \namong bond investors to promote demand for LCY bonds as part of the Asian Bond Markets \nInitiative (ABMI). \n \n2.  The TA follows the guidance of Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe ABMI Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022. The TA aligns with the ADB Strategy 2030 \noperation  plan  for  priority  7:  Fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (2019\u20132024), \nparticularly its second pillar (global and regional trade and investment opportunities expanded) \nand third sub-pillar (strengthening regional financial cooperation). The TA activities also align with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by producing public goods that increase regional finance sector cooperation \nand integration.2 Specifically, the TA generates publicly available information on regional bond \nmarkets and strengthens finance sector cooperation through regional bond market initiatives. \nThus, these activities closely follow ADB\u2019s key operational priorities in Strategy 2030\u2014fostering \nregional  cooperation  and  integration\u2014particularly  in  the  finance  sector  and  through  other \nsubregional initiatives. \n \n3.  The TA will undertake its activities under ABMI Task Force 2, following the guidance of \nthe ABMI road map, which was endorsed by ASEAN+3 governments in May 2019.3 The TA will \nupgrade  the  bond  market  data  portal,  the  AsianBondsOnline  (ABO)  website,  into  a \ncomprehensive regional bond market information platform that disseminates a wide range of \ninformation\u2014including market data, knowledge products, policy and regulatory changes, and \nrecent market practices\u2014from all ABMI task forces in an integrated and systematic way to \nfacilitate communication with regional and global investors and issuers. As the primary information \nplatform for ASEAN+3 bond markets, the enhanced ABO portal will better serve stakeholders \nwithin and outside ASEAN+3 member economies. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A key lesson from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis was the need to develop LCY bond \nmarkets as an integral part of deeper, more liquid, and more balanced financial systems across \nthe region. The crisis catalyzed the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation process, including ABMI and \nthe Chiang Mai Initiative and its subsequent multilateralization. Since its launch in December 2002, \nABMI has (i) helped develop regional LCY bond markets to mitigate the double mismatch \n(currency and maturity) problem at the heart of the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis, and (ii) \npromoted  regional  financial  development  and  stability.  As  of  December  2019,  LCY  bonds \noutstanding in regional markets reached $16.0 trillion, a more than 14-fold increase since 2002. \nThe  aggregate  size  of  the  region\u2019s  LCY  bond  markets  is  now  approaching  that  of  euro-\ndenominated bond markets.4 In addition, sukuk (Islamic bond) markets and green bond financing \nare developing rapidly in the region. \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 February 2020. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/435391/strategy-2030- main-document.pdf. \n3  ABMI. 2019. ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022. Nadi. \n  https://asianbondsonline.adb.org/documents/abmi_medium_term_road_map.pdf. \n4 Ibid \n ", "2 \n5.  Despite the rapid growth of emerging East Asian LCY bond markets, the region still lacks \na well-diversified investor base, which limits the demand for LCY bonds and constrains financing \nfor the region\u2019s large infrastructure investment needs. A strong investor profile can enhance \nmarket liquidity, pricing efficiency, and resilience to external shocks. Within the region, some bond \nmarkets have limited foreign participation, while other markets lack a well-diversified domestic \ninvestor base. Many factors contribute to the lack of investor diversification, including weak \ninstitutional  factors,  inconsistent  legal  and  regulatory  practices,  less-developed  market \ninfrastructures, relatively small investor bases, different levels of finance sector development, \ninconsistent credit rating practices, high transaction costs, and lack of market depth. \n \n6.  Information asymmetry. In addition to the factors listed above (para. 5), information \nasymmetry faced by bond market participants constrains the diversification of investor base. The \nlack of up-to-date information on regional bond markets is even more pronounced for small and \nfrontier bond markets. Investors will avoid financial markets which entail greater information \nasymmetry. When investors face limited and unclear information on market development status, \nmarket access, and regulatory and policy practices, they will not invest. For example, many \nforeign investors requested information on how to invest in fast-growing emerging bond markets \nlike Viet Nam.  Although the Viet Nam bond market welcomes foreign participants, investors \nlacked  timely  information  on  whether  they  can  invest,  how  to  invest,  and  relevant  market \nprocedures and processes. The lack of timely information constrained the development of a well-\ndiversified investor base. Smaller, frontier regional bond markets have only limited publicly \navailable bond market data; disseminating more information on bond market development will help \nmitigate this issue. For smaller ASEAN bond markets, a regional platform can more effectively \ndisseminate information to investors. \n \n7.  Low levels of intraregional portfolio investments. ASEAN+3 has close intraregional \neconomic linkages, but intraregional portfolio investments are relatively low, which limits the \nregion\u2019s ability to expand its investor base. The region\u2019s limited cooperation and integration in \nfinance arises from  different market practices  and regulations  and inconsistent  information \ndisclosure  and  standards.  Further,  the  region\u2019s  bond  markets  are  at  different  stages  of \ndevelopment and have different market structures. Some regional markets are at a relatively early \nstage of government bond market development, while others are now prioritizing corporate bond \nmarket  development,  enhancing  market  liquidity,  and  designing  hedging  instruments.  The \nrelatively low level of intraregional portfolio flows also hinders regional bond markets from \nreaching a minimum efficient scale. To tackle this issue, ABO will enhance regional knowledge \nsharing  among  regional  bond  market  development  that  will  increase  communication  and \ncollaboration among regional bond markets, boost common regional practices, and coordinate \nregulations. \n \n8.  ABMI has boosted regional bond market development on several fronts. Some activities \npromote the supply side by facilitating bond issuances, other initiatives improve bond market data \nand information dissemination, and yet other efforts enhance bond market infrastructure through \nharmonized market practices. Under ABMI Task Force 2, ABO disseminates information on \nregional bond markets and fosters demand for regional bond market instruments by disseminating \ncomprehensive  up-to-date  information  that  focuses  on  regional  markets,  including  frontier \nregional bond markets. ABO also collaborates with regional government authorities to facilitate \nregional knowledge sharing on bond market development and updates investors and issuers on \nrecent policy and regulation revisions. ABO\u2019s key stakeholders include market participants as well \nas regulators and policy makers within and outside the region. \n \n \n ", "3 \n9.  ADB has been serving as the ABMI secretariat and maintains the ABO website. During its \nyears of operation and improvement, ABO gained wide recognition as the gateway to ASEAN+3 \nbond market data. ABO information has been recognized and cited by the Group of Twenty (G20), \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, and used in commercial databases \nlike Bloomberg. Compared with World Bank and IMF data, ABO offers more comprehensive, up-to-\ndate, and in-depth bond market information for ASEAN+3 markets. For example, the IMF Global \nDebt Database updated Malaysia data only to 2016 as of August 2019, while ABO updates data \nwith a lag of only one quarter. Other commercial databases like Bloomberg collect data such as \nforeign holdings from ABO for regional bond markets. As a regional public good, ABO offers free \nbond market information that helps various stakeholders who cannot access costly commercial \ndatabases to gain information about regional bond markets. \n \n10.  During previous operations, a key lesson learned is to remain flexible and stay client-\noriented to better meet the demands of stakeholders. The TA builds on previous TA projects that \nhave continuously enhanced ABO and improved user experience. Since ABO\u2019s inception in 2004, \nearlier TA projects established the ABO website framework, set up the online database, and \ndelivered knowledge products and services. After more than one decade, the ABO website began \nto fall behind fast advances in information technology. User survey feedback indicated demand \nfor a website upgrade. Thus, under the current TA, the revamped ABO adopted a new database \nstructure with an interactive interface. Instead of having to download the whole time series to their \ncomputers, users can now tailor their data requests by selecting desired indicators, markets, \nperiods, and frequency. The users can also view, create and download online charts based on \ndata selection criteria. In addition, the current TA also meets users\u2019 data demand for foreign \ncapital flows. ABO launched a new product, the monthly debt roundup, an infographic that makes \nit easy for users to get relevant information. Surveyed users and ABMI task force meetings have \nreceived the revamped website under the TA 9404: Supporting the Development of Asian Bond \nMarkets through AsianBondsOnline  well, but some stakeholders suggested that ABO should also \npublicize work under other ABMI task forces to form synergy among ABMI efforts. The demand \nfor synchronized information reflects users\u2019 desire to obtain all the information they want from a \none-stop website. Thus, the TA will echo the users\u2019 demand and strengthen synergy among ABMI \ntask forces to better serve stakeholders. \n \n11.  In response, to add more value to ABO as an information portal, the TA will follow the \nABMI road map and upgrade ABO to become an integrated information platform for regional bond \nmarkets. In particular, ABO will synchronize bond market information and knowledge products \nand services from all ABMI activities; ABO\u2019s enhanced website structure and information sections \nwill  enable  users  to  easily  access  all  relevant  information  about  regional  bonds  markets \ndevelopment in one stop. The upgraded ABO will promote synergy among all ABMI task forces \nand, thus, better serve investors and improve investor awareness about ASEAN+3 bond markets. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: investor awareness of regional bond markets \nenhanced .5 The TA will have the following outcomes: (i) access to information on regional bond \nmarket improved and (ii) knowledge of regional bond market development promoted.6 \n \n5   ADB. 2018.

Output 1: Dissemination of information on ASEAN+3 bond markets strengthened. \nThe TA will revamp ABO to be a regional bond market information platform by including new \nsections that disseminate information on all aspects of ABMI activity, including bond demand, \nbond  supply,  market  infrastructure,  and  cross-border  collaterals.  Under  the  TA,  ABO  will \ncoordinate with other ABMI task forces to reflect up-to-date market status and progress. For \nexample, the revamped ABO portal will launch an Asian green bond section, collaborating with \nthe green bond TA7 under ABMI Task Force 1 to disseminate new green bond market practices \nand recent demand and supply information to attract more investors to regional green bond \nmarkets.  Another new section will serve as the online gateway to the ASEAN+3 Bond Market \nForum under ABMI Task Force 3. The ABO website will publicize information, when possible and \nneeded, for all other activities under all four ABMI task forces. In addition to new contents and \nfeatures, ABO will continue to disseminate bond market data and enhance its website design and \ninterface to improve user experience. ABO will also coordinate with the web team of ADB\u2019s \nDepartment of Communications to ensure smooth navigation and maximize outreach. \n \n14.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing about ASEAN+3 bond market increased. The TA will \ncontinue to provide knowledge products and knowledge services to increase knowledge sharing \nand broaden and deepen the understanding of ASEAN+3 LCY bond markets. The TA will deliver \nthree market-relevant knowledge products: (i) the quarterly ADB flagship report Asia Bond Monitor, \n(ii) a monthly debt roundup, and (iii) weekly debt highlights. Asia Bond Monitor provides updated \nmarket summaries and in-depth analysis of trending issues in regional bond markets. The monthly \ndebt roundup is an infographic report that updates readers on changes in financial conditions, \ncapital flow patterns, and monetary stances in the region. The weekly debt highlights appear in a \nweekly  newsletter  that  offers  users  the  latest  news  on  regional  bond  markets.  ABO  will \ndisseminate the knowledge products mainly by digital publication but will make printed copies \navailable upon user request. For example, some users\u2014such as libraries, embassies, resident \nmissions, financial institutions, and those with inconvenient internet access\u2014may request hard \ncopies occasionally. The TA will also enhance regional knowledge sharing through annual \ncapacity-building workshops tailored to the host market\u2019s bond market development needs. Based \non the host market\u2019s priorities and strategies, each workshop will mobilize knowledge across the \nregion to share experiences, lessons, and expertise. This exercise will foster regional knowledge \nsharing and contribute to harmonization and collaboration within the region. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund (ICFF)  under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.8 The key expenditure items are in \nAppendix 2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan. \n \n16.  The ICFF will finance capacity-building workshops, minimal equipment, the dissemination \nof knowledge products, and recruitment of consultants. All items in Appendix 2 are eligible for \nICFF financing and in accordance with ICFF guidelines, with non-consultant costs not exceeding \n30% of the total TA cost. \n \n \n7 ADB. forthcoming.
