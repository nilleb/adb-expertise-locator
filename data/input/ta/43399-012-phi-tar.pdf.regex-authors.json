INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  After the successful completion in September 2009 of the Development Policy Support \nProgram (DPSP) assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of the \nPhilippines  again  sought  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  implementing  measures  to  strengthen  the \nbusiness climate.1 The measures were part of the post-program partnership framework (P3F) \ndeveloped  under  subprogram  3  of  the  DPSP.  ADB  was  also  to  help  the  government  in \nformulating  and  implementing  other  measures  with  the  same  objective.  In  March  2011,  a \nfact-finding mission reached an understanding with the government on the objectives, scope, \nand  implementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA). 2  A \nreconnaissance mission in June 2011 refined the proposed TA in light of the new Philippine \nDevelopment Plan (PDP), 2011\u20132016. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n  \nA.  ADB Support for Reforms in the Investment Climate \n2.  ADB has long supported reforms in the Philippine investment and business climate \nthrough  knowledge  products,  TA,  policy-based  lending,  and  investment  projects.  The \ninvestment climate was one of four broad policy reform areas covered by the DPSP, which \nsupported the government\u2019s efforts to reduce the transaction costs in business regulation and \nimprove infrastructure policy. A TA project attached to subprogram 1 of the DPSP produced \noptions for regulatory review and studies on the farmer-to-supermarket supply chain, investment \nincentives, competition policy, and the difficulties experienced by the youth in their transition \nfrom school to work, among other analytical reports. The P3F developed under the DPSP \nspecified policy measures for the government to implement in 2009\u20132011, to sustain the policy \ndialogue on the investment climate and further advance reforms (Appendix 2). A key P3F policy \nmeasure was the development and implementation of a national strategy for regulatory impact \nassessment (RIA) in government. The RIA is a systematic and transparent process of drafting \nand reviewing business regulations. The DPSP yielded several key lessons: (i) the investment \nclimate needs to undergo deeper reform, (ii) the investment climate should be viewed more \nbroadly to include an enabling environment where businesses can operate competitively, (iii) the \ninvestment climate should also include investment in human capital, and (iv) stakeholders must \nparticipate in drawing up programs and monitoring reforms. \n \n3.  The proposed TA will build on past ADB assistance to the sector and keep up the \ngovernment\u2019s broader reform momentum, to create an enabling environment for businesses to \noperate competitively, generate employment, and reduce poverty. The TA will provide technical \ninput and assistance in implementing policy measures under the P3F, such as the RIA, and in \nformulating  and  implementing  related  policies  prioritized  in  PDP,  2011\u20132016  such  as  the \npolicies for the development of capacity to encourage competition, enforce efficient taxation, \ncreate jobs, and develop skills. The proposed TA will also support the National Competitiveness \nCouncil  (NCC),  a  public\u2013private  forum  at  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  (DTI),  in \npromoting competitiveness. The design of the program is tightly linked to the recommendations \nin ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, which emphasize the need to lower the regulatory \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

The Philippines\u2019 Growth Potential \n4.  ADB estimates the Philippines\u2019 potential growth rate at around 5.0%\u2014not enough for the \ncountry to create good jobs for the more than 1.2 million who enter the labor market each year. \nSustained growth of close to 6.0% yearly is necessary. The ongoing structural change in the \neconomy, spurred  by reforms  in  Philippine  telecommunications,  phenomenal growth  in the \nglobal business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, and the rapid increase in remittances from \noverseas Filipino workers, presents immense opportunities for more vigorous growth. Services \nhave  driven  growth  in  recent  years,  and,  within  services,  communications,  information \ntechnology, and the related BPO industry are now the leading sectors. Finance and tourism \nhave also made robust progress in recent years. These service sectors are labor intensive, \nsome are skill intensive, and all have important positive externalities with the rest of economy. \nMany of the services are traded internationally. A 2007 report prepared by the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) noted the prospects of service-led growth in the Philippines and pointed to \nthe  higher  growth  rate  achieved  between  2000  and  2005  on  the  strength  of  total  factor \nproductivity growth in the services sector.5  \n \nC.  Investment Rate \n5.  The ratio of private and public investment to gross domestic product (GDP) was slow to \nrecover from the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. The investment rate reached 24.0% \nof GDP in the mid-1990s but declined in the aftermath of the crisis and bottomed out at 13.0% in \n2005 before recovering in 2010 to 15.0%, still well below the rate in much of the rest of \nSoutheast Asia. A combination of factors explain the decline and slow recovery: (i) a weak \nbusiness environment and weak institutions; (ii) limited fiscal space for public capital investment; \nand (iii) structural change in the economy, with the rapidly growing service sector requiring less \ninvestment (footnote 5). \n \nD.  Competitiveness \n \n6.  The  Philippines  continues  to  rank  low  in  international  surveys  of  competitiveness \nbecause  of  the  high  costs  to  business  of  complying  with  regulations,  the  prevalence  of \nanticompetitive regulation, the high transaction costs in trade facilitation, and weak governance.6 \nADB diagnostic studies carried out under the DPSP and at the Economics and Research \nDepartment underscore key improvements that must be made. A forthcoming ADB publication \ngoes over the key constraints on the investment attractiveness of the Philippines relative to its \nneighbors\u2014including  excessive  red  tape,  anticompetitive  practices  in  some  industries, \nrestrictive tax policy, and corruption.7 An ADB\u2013Japan Fair Trade Commission conference in \n2010 on competition policy also drew attention to anticompetitive regulations in sectors with \neconomy-wide linkages and anticompetitive behavior in several major sectors.8A 2007 ADB \nreport highlighted the major limitations imposed by inadequate infrastructure on private sector \n                                                \n4   K.

Employment Generation \n \n7.  ADB staff reports have found weaknesses in the labor market that have contributed to \nmaking industries less competitive and the distribution of the benefits of recent economic growth \nless equitable. According to a forthcoming ADB publication,10 the youth are kept from making a \nquick transition from school to better jobs in the domestic labor market by several factors. One \nfactor is their inability to make informed decisions about investing in higher education because \nthey lack information about the labor market and the skills that industries need. Not enough \nactive employment services exist to help local government units (LGUs) match the supply of \nworkers to the demand. As a result, the supply of skills does not match the need in several \ngrowth sectors of the economy. Unemployment persists, yet some industry groups complain \nabout emerging skill shortages in the fast-growing communications and information sectors, \nincluding  the  higher-value-added  BPO  industry,  and  the  inadequate  preparation  of  young \npersons for employment in other sectors such as tourism and construction. Industry models for \nskills development could help address these skill shortages. Another factor standing in the way \nto productive employment for the youth of the country is the inadequate protection provided by \nemployment safety net programs against economic shocks. Labor market regulations are seen \nto be a further obstacle to transition to the labor market, mobility, and lifetime employability.   \n \nF.  The Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 \n \n8.  Improved  competitiveness  and  employment  generation  are  core  objectives  of \nPDP, 2011\u20132016. Key components of the strategy for improving competitiveness are less red \ntape, more domestic competition, stronger public\u2013private partnership in infrastructure, better \nlogistics, better developed human capital, and efficient labor market policies. To help implement \nthe PDP priorities, the government is finalizing several sector strategies, most with a time-bound \nimplementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial  responsibilities.  The  NCC  is  also \ncoordinating among key line ministries to address constraints on competitiveness.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be to support improvements in the business climate so that \nbusinesses can operate competitively. The outcome will be key policy measures under the P3F \nof the DPSP and new policy priorities under PDP, 2011\u20132016.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have three components: (i) competition policy and regulatory efficiency, \n(ii) policies to lower the transaction costs of doing business, and (iii) employment generation. \n \n \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2007.

Component 1: Competition Policy and Regulatory Efficiency \n \n11.  Economic efficiency will be promoted in two ways. First, the National Economic and \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) will be assisted in institutionalizing a regulatory review process \nin government to improve regulatory transparency, lower the costs to business of complying \nwith  regulations,  and  minimize  the  anticompetitive  effects  of  proposed  regulations  on  the \nbusiness community. NEDA  will be helped in  building public awareness of RIA, achieving \nconsensus among key stakeholders on the key principles of the RIA process, and developing an \naction plan for regulatory review, including a time frame for establishing an office of better \nregulatory practice in the national government. Line ministries will carry out pilot RIA programs \nand undertake RIAs on proposed legislation and regulations, under the TA. NEDA and the DTI \nwill also be assisted in designing a budgetary performance-based incentives program to reduce \nred tape in national and regional government. Another output of this component will include a \nsurvey  of  140  enterprises  representing the  non-agriculture  sector  to estimate  the  costs to \nbusiness of complying with regulations. \n \n12.  Second, the status of competition policy in the Philippines will be examined, current draft \ncompetition and anti-trust laws will be reviewed and improvements based on international and \nregional best practices for middle-income countries will be recommended, and an action plan for \nthe establishment of a competition agency will be prepared. \n \n  2.  Component 2: Policies to Lower Transaction Costs of Doing Business \n \n13.  This component will support the implementation of activities and reforms to lower the \nadministrative or transaction costs of doing business. This will be done in three ways. First, ADB \nwill work with DTI and the NCC to implement the business licensing simplification program in \nLGUs. The assistance will extend to  advocacy of the reforms and the establishment of a \nmonitoring and evaluation framework to track the reforms. Second, ADB will assist NCC in \nprioritizing  key  policy  constraints  on  competitiveness  and  finding  ways  of  addressing  the \nconstraints effectively. Third, assistance will be provided in assessing tax policies that impede or \npromote skills development and innovation in the economy.  \n \n  3.  Component 3: Employment Generation \n \n14.  The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the Department of Tourism \n(DOT) will be assisted in developing and implementing programs to generate employment. \nAssistance will be provided in four ways. First, ADB will work with DOLE to improve labor \nmarket information systems in support of employment facilitation by (i) developing an action \nplan for the strengthening of the systems, including industry skills forecasting; and (ii) supporting \nthe institutionalization of the public employment service offices in the LGUs. Second, ADB will \nwork with the DOT and with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) \nthrough DOT to design and set up a tourism industry\u2013led skills development program, which \ncould include a skills development fund to finance vocational training programs, initiatives for \nthe certification of professionals in the sector, and the development of capacity to implement the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  framework  arrangement  for  the  mutual \nrecognition of professionals in the sector. Third, ADB will work with BPO industry leaders in the \ntourism sector to design an industry-led skills development program and formulate actions for \nthe longer-term development of the sector. Fourth, ADB will work with DOLE to assess the \nfeasibility of a minimum employment guarantee scheme for vulnerable workers affected by \neconomic and natural disasters.  \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nfinance the remaining $200,000 in kind, to cover the counterpart costs. The TA cost estimates \nand financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  NEDA will be the executing agency. The DTI (and NCC), DOT, the Department of \nFinance, the Department of Justice, and DOLE will be the implementing agencies. NEDA will \nmake available office space with furniture and support services for the consultants, while the TA \nwill support the procurement of office computers and supplies. Oversight of activities will be \nprovided by NEDA and by the Department of Finance (in tax policy matters) for component 1, \nDTI  (and  NCC)  for  component 2,  and  DOLE  and  DOT  for  component 3.  A  team  of  nine \ninternational consultants (for a total of 30 person-months) and three national consultants (for a \ntotal  of  36  person-months)  will  be  hired.  ADB  will  recruit  the  consultants  individually  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment procurement under the TA will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and the assets will \nbe handed over to NEDA after the project. \n \n17.  A project management unit (PMU) will be established at NEDA and funded under the TA. \nThe  PMU  will  coordinate  the  TA  activities,  provide  overall  administration  and  supervision, \nfacilitate  communication  and financial transactions  with  ADB,  take responsibility  for  annual \nauditing and progress monitoring, and provide logistic and administrative support to a group of \nprivate sector stakeholders to be established under the TA. The group will be an informal \ngathering  of  representatives  from  the  various  Philippine  chambers  of  commerce,  industry \ngroups, and academe. It will provide input to the TA activities, and support the monitoring of TA \nactivities and the advocacy of TA output.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 28 months, from September 2011 to January 2014. \nConsultant deliverables are included in the terms of reference in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  for  Strengthening  Institutions  for  an  Improved  Investment  Climate,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \nImprovements in the  By  end of 2016:    Macroeconomic stability is \nbusiness climate      maintained. \nNumber of days to  National income data   \nlaunch a business  published by the National  Risk \nreduced by 10%  Statistical Coordination  National government departments \n(baseline 2010)   Board (NSCB) under  lack effective coordination. \n  NEDA \nOutcome      Assumption \nKey business climate  By mid-2016:    Government stays on course in \npolicy measures under  P3F measures under  key business regulatory reform. \nADB review missions \nP3F implemented and  the DPSP carried out   \n \nnew measures  formulated  Risk \n  \nfor the proposed ICIG  Government agencies and \n \nprogram cluster   stakeholders lack commitment and \n  willingness to participate in \nimplementing reforms. \nOutputs      Risks \n1.
