THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  facility  (TRTA  facility)  will  provide  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and project management-related capacity building and support to \nongoing and future projects within South Asia. Lessons learned from the implementation of TA \n8555-REG have contributed to the improvement of effective procurement operations and project \nimplementation  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funded  projects  in  South  Asia. 1 \nNotwithstanding  the  successful  implementation  of  the  previous  TA,  the  continuation  and \nexpansion of the scope of the TRTA facility support is essential for the growth of ADB operations \nin the region in response to the new operational demands under Strategy 2030. The proposed \nsupport  would  include  country  and  sector  specific  assessments  and  recommendations  on \nfinancial and project management, and procurement processes. Specifically, the TRTA facility will \nprovide (i) demand driven assistance on project design and implementation; (ii) studies, seminars \nand workshops on financial management; (iii) enhancement of the procurement and contract \nmanagement  capacity  of  executing  agencies  through  the  engagement  of  IT  specialists, \nprocurement consultants and International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) experts; \nand (iv) knowledge sharing of best practices. \n \n2.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The proposed TRTA facility is in line with one of the key \noperational priorities of Strategy 2030 in strengthening governance and institutional capacity as \nthe basis for development. It will support public management reforms and financial stability and \nstrengthen service delivery and capacity of the member countries in South Asia.  \n \n3.  Need for Better Project Implementation. ADB needs to uphold high standards for \nfinancial management, project management, and procurement and contract management to \nimplement  Strategy  2030.  The  outcome  of  the  TRTA  facility  will  be  improved  project \nimplementation and portfolio performance in South Asia for faster and higher quality of project \nimplementation, timely contract awards and accelerated disbursement of project financing.  \n \n4.  The President approved the memo on Strengthening ADB\u2019s Financial Management in \nSovereign  Operations  on  10  December  2018.  This  initiative  aims  to  provide  targeted  and \nsustained capacity building programs for executing and implementing agencies, and national \npublic  and  private  auditors.  In  response  to  the  initiative,  the  TRTA  facility  will  work  with \ngovernment entities that are taking on a larger share of public service delivery to improve their \nfinancial management capacities. \n \n5.  The TRTA facility will promote the adoption of advanced technology applications to \nimprove the quality of project design and project management in response to Strategy 2030. The \nTA  will  cover  pilot  testing  for  the  application  of  advanced  technologies  upon  demand.  A \npreliminary assessment will be conducted for potential areas of project monitoring and reporting, \nuse of drone technology, and application of building information modeling (BIM).  \n \n6.  The TRTA facility seeks to maintain ADB\u2019s operational efficiency and effectiveness to \nsupport better project implementation during the reform and rationalization of ADB\u2019s procurement \nsystem.  It  will  complement  and  reinforce  procurement  related  initiatives  conducted  by  the \nProcurement,  Portfolio  and  Financial  Management  Department  (PPFD)  and  other  regional \ndepartments.  Drawing  on  lessons  learned  from  these  initiatives,  the  South  Asia  Regional \n \n1  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Improving Procurement in South Asia Department. Manila. \n ", "2 \nDepartment (SARD) will continue to develop appropriate actions for longer-term sustainability of \nprocurement and institutional capacity development among its member countries.  \n \n7.  On project-specific interventions, the TRTA facility will provide support to two energy \nprojects in the pipeline namely BAN: Dhaka and Western Zone Transmission Grid Expansion \nProject and IND: Maharashtra Rural High Voltage Distribution (HVD) System Program. Both the \nGovernment of Bangladesh and the Government of India are considering the application of drones \nin the power transmission and distribution sector where drones can be used for stringing of \ntransmission and distribution lines. Under the TRTA facility, consultancy support for use of drones \ncan be provided along with procurement and contract management assistance due to the high-\nvalue procurement for works, turnkey and supply and installation contracts for both projects. \nFinancial management and reporting support are also required for the executing agency of the \nMaharashtra Rural HVD Program. \n \n8.  The TRTA facility will take a partnership and demand-driven approach that supports \nexecuting and implementing agencies and other key stakeholders in consultation with respective \ndeveloping member country (DMC) governments. This will ensure ownership by and commitment \nfrom executing and implementing agencies. \n \n9.  The TRTA facility will complement other TA projects in supporting improved project \nimplementation and not duplicate ongoing assistance which addresses portfolio management in \ngeneral.  \n \n10.  Since the proposed TRTA facility will cover all South Asian countries, and ultimately all \nsectors within these countries, it would not be appropriate or possible to incorporate the proposed \nTA into a single loan-financed operation. This TRTA facility is not listed in the current Country \nOperations Business Plans (COBPs) but will support projects listed in the COBPs (Appendix 2).2 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Financial  management  capacity  of  executing/implementing  agencies \nimproved. The TRTA facility will support financial management capacity building of government \nagencies  in  the  South  Asia  region.  This  will  include  providing  support  to  executing  and \nimplementing agencies and supreme audit institutions to address issues related to Audited Project \nFinancial Statements (APFS) and Audited Entity Financial Statements (AEFS) in the timely \nsubmission and improved quality of these reports. The TRTA facility will support workshops and \nrelated training programs on financial management. The training programs would be identified \nbased on the assessment of capacity of executing agencies. In addition, consultants will be \nengaged  to  review  and  provide  analysis  of  issues  and  proposed  measures  for  financial \nmanagement strengthening. \n \n12.  At least ten training programs will be conducted for staff of executing agencies and \nsupreme audit institutions on accounting and financial statements/reports preparation and ADB \nfinancial reporting and audit requirements. Consulting firms will be engaged to conduct at least \n \n2 ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2020-2022. Manila; ADB. 2019.

Individual consultants will also be engaged to \nreview APFS/AEFS, provide feedback to executing/implementing agencies, and enhance their \nfinancial management monitoring systems.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Project management and evaluation capacity of executing/implementing \nagencies  strengthened  using  innovative  technology  applications.  One  of  the  guiding \nprinciples for ADB\u2019s operations in Strategy 2030 is promoting innovative technology. ADB will \nproactively seek ways to promote the use of advanced technologies across its operations and \nprovide capacity building support to DMCs. The use of advance technology will improve efficiency \nin data collection, monitoring, analysis and evaluation, which will increase efficiency and reduce \ncost as the main drivers for widespread adoption.  \n \n14.  The TRTA facility will introduce the use of digital, cloud-based and real-time applications \nto project monitoring and reporting. Digital reporting forms to be filled up on mobile and tablet \napplications can provide day-to-day updates from the field with data stored in the cloud for easy \nretrieval and access from any location. Data collected can be analyzed and presented in different \nformats or dashboards tailored to specific needs or users. This will facilitate  efficient data \ncollection, access and analysis for enhanced project implementation monitoring. \n \n15.  The TRTA facility will promote the application of drones in project implementation to DMCs \nwho have not yet started using this technology and the dissemination of best practices and \nlessons learned from those who already do. The application of drones offers improved efficiency \nin project management. This is particularly true for the implementation of road projects but also \nfor urban projects. For the latter, drones would be useful for laying of pipelines and drains, \ndesigning waste collection, collecting housing data for urban planning, and developing post \ndisaster hazard maps. Drones are also reliable in the evaluation of projects specially during \nproject completion as they provide precise data, capture visual imagery, minimize down-time and \nimprove safety. \n \n16.  Based on consultations between ADB and relevant agencies in each country, the TRTA \nfacility will focus on one or two projects in selected DMCs. The selection will depend on existing \ndrone legislation in each country. This advanced technology application will subsequently be \nexpanded to other projects. Individual consultants on drone technology will be engaged to assist \nin the data gathering including a drone pilot.  \n \n17.  The TRTA facility may also consider the use of building information modeling (BIM) to \nbetter monitor projects during construction. BIM provides simulation tools that visualize the \nprogress of works. The software also includes a program planning and cost component. The \ncombination of these project management factors will help anticipate, avoid, minimize or mitigate \nproject risks, thereby improving overall coordination, communication and collaboration between \nstakeholders. \n \n18.   The application of these advanced technologies can be done through workshops, training \nsessions, and project management applications. Project agencies will be closely consulted to \nensure implementation of the proposed outputs. \n \n19.  Workshops and related training programs will focus on critical needs and identified \nproblems. Good practices and lessons will be documented, shared, and replicated. Brief study \ntours to locations where advanced technology is effectively implemented will also be considered. \n \n ", "4 \n20.  Output 3: Procurement and contract management capacity enhanced. The TRTA \nfacility will continue end-to-end support for improving procurement results by providing hands-on \nsupport and direct assistance during key stages of the procurement process to executing and \nimplementing agencies on a demand basis, or whom ADB project teams assess would benefit \nfrom such support. The procurement operations would include works, equipment, and consulting \nservices, among others.  \n \n21.  The support would cover as necessary the entire procurement cycle, from preparation of \nprocurement documentation to award of contracts. This includes assistance with evaluating the \nresults of procurement invitations and obtaining the approval of the outcome of the evaluation. \nMore specifically, training programs will include selection of consultants, contract management, \nand project readiness under the 2017 ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers. The objective would be effective and transparent procurement for all ADB-\nsupported projects across the region.  \n \n22.  The TRTA facility would aim to develop a training module on procurement of works, \ncontract  management  and  dispute  resolution  based  under  FIDIC  conditions  of  contract  in \ncoordination with PPFD. Individual international and national procurement consultants including \na  FIDIC  expert  will  be  engaged  to  develop  the  module  and  provide  hands-on  support  to \nexecuting/implementing agencies. \n \n23.  To support the roll out of the 2017 ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers, refresher training courses and sessions will be conducted by individual \ninternational and national procurement consultants. Knowledge sharing sessions on problems \nencountered  in  procurement  under  ADB-financed  projects  will  also  be  conducted  among \nexecuting and implementing agencies. Resource persons and ADB staff will participate in the \ntraining programs and workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n24.  The TRTA facility is estimated to cost $2,500,000 million to be financed on a grant basis \nfrom ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Fund (TASF-VI). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 1. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The TRTA facility will commence in October 2019 and will be completed by September \n2024. ADB will be the executing agency. SARD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, and Quality Control Unit is \nthe  focal  point  within  ADB  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  coordination,  supervision,  and \nimplementation of all TA activities. The unit will be responsible for the selection, engagement, and \nevaluation of consultants and will manage and oversee TA implementation, working closely with \nthe resident missions within SARD and executing and implementing agencies in South Asia \nDMCs. \n \n26.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2019\u2014September 2024 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  SARD, ADB \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by SARD, ADB \nFirm: QBS   National (48  $500,000 \n  person-months)   \n     \n     \nIndividual: ICS  International (69   \nperson-months)  $680,000 \n   \nNational (130  $670,000 \nperson-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Not applicable \narrangement upon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ICS = Individual Consultant Selection; QBS = Quality Based Selection; SARD = South \nAsia Department; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n27.
