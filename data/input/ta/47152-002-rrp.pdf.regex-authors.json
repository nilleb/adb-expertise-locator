THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Irrigated Agriculture Inclusive Development \nProject.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to \nbe provided by the Global Environment Facility for the Rural Productivity and Ecosystems \nServices  Enhanced  in  Central  Dry  Zone  Forest  Reserves,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \n2.  The sector project will increase agricultural value added by improving irrigation and \nstrengthening agricultural value chains in three regions of Myanmar's central dry zone (CDZ).2 It \nwill support the development of district-wide agricultural value chains and the modernization of \nirrigation systems in Magway district of the Magway region, Shwebo district of the Sagaing \nregion,  and  Meiktila  and  Yamethin  districts  in  the  Mandalay  region  during  a  7-year \nimplementation period. The irrigation system rehabilitation and modernization component will \ncover about 20,000 hectares (ha) and benefit about 24,000 households. 3 Parallel to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) project, cofinancing from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD)  will  strengthen  local,  regional,  and  national  capacity  for  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development issues. Agriculture accounted for 31% of the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct, 52% of employment, and 20% of exports in 2014.4 Despite good land5 and water \nresource endowments,6 an ample pool of low-cost labor, and proximity to large regional markets, \nMyanmar has significantly underperformed neighboring countries in terms of labor and land \nproductivity since the 1960s. Growth in the agriculture sector was only 3.3% in 2014, and most \nfarming systems are caught in a low equilibrium trap: low inputs result in low productivity and \nlow quality of outputs that bring low returns. This contributes to a high incidence of poverty, food \ninsecurity, indebtedness, malnutrition, and low levels of education among the rural poor. \n \n4.  Although  sector  indicators  reflect  an  economy  in  transition,  Myanmar\u2019s  agricultural \ndevelopment potential is considerable and offers a significant opportunity for inclusive economic \ngrowth.7 The country has 18.2 million ha of arable land, of which only 13.3 million ha (73%) are \ncultivated at present. In the monsoon season, only 2.1 million ha of cultivated land are irrigated, \nwhile the remaining 11.2 million ha are rain-fed. Rice is the main crop. Other crops include \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The project meets the criteria for a sector project that (i) the government have an agriculture sector development \nplan and appropriate sector policies; (ii) there be sufficient institutional capacity to implement the plan; and (iii) the \nassistance support the articulation of strategic sector policy priorities. (ADB. 2003. Sector Lending. Operations \nManual. OM D3/BP. Manila).  \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Irrigation Command \nArea Development Project. (TA 8583-MYA). \n4  ADB. 2015. Country Information Note. Manila. \n5  In Myanmar, the average farm size of 3 ha is higher than in other developing Asian countries. Myanmar also has a \nlarger share of the workforce working in agriculture, and the average age of farmers is lower. \n6  Myanmar\u2019s water resources are considerable. Four river systems supply more than 19,000 cubic meters per capita \nof water each year, compared with an average 4,000 cubic meters per year across Asia.  The country currently \nuses less than 10% of its water resources.  \n7  ADB. 2014. Myanmar: Unlocking the Potential\u2014Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. ", "2    \npulses, oilseeds, maize, cotton, rubber, sugarcane, tropical fruits, and vegetables.8 The potential \nfor further developing the value chain for these crops is significant. \n \n5.  Sector constraints. The CDZ has the second-highest population density but remains \none of the least developed.9 Seasonal water shortages caused by low and erratic annual rainfall \npatterns  and  sandy  and  fragile  soils  render  agriculture  a  high-risk  endeavor.10 Key  sector \nconstraints in the CDZ include (i) weak land and water resource management; (ii) disjointed \nagricultural value chains, with poor access to support services, inputs, and inadequate post-\nharvest operations and marketing arrangements; (iii) poor irrigation infrastructure and weak \nmanagement, resulting in unreliable and inequitable access to water; (iv) insufficient operational \nflexibility  to  cope  with  the  emerging  impacts  of  climate  change;  and  (v)  insufficient  public \ninvestment and private sector participation.  \n \n6.  Revitalizing agriculture and promoting agricultural value chains. Stimulating and \ndeveloping agricultural value chains will help ensure balanced, integrated rural development \nand income growth for farmers in the CDZ. Improvements in the value chains through research \nand  development  and  extension  delivery  of  improved  cropping  systems  that  increase  the \nproduction of pulses, oilseeds, and other non-rice crops are necessary to raise both on-farm \nand off-farm agricultural productivity. Predictable water supply is an important prerequisite but \nonly part of the solution. Along with improving access to irrigation, a broader focus on integrated \nvalue chain development will help enhance the production base and ensure that farmers have \nmore access to production credit and quality seeds and other farm inputs at reasonable prices. \n \n7.  Irrigated agriculture. Myanmar increased its investment in new irrigation systems in \n1960 and stepped this up after 1990, but construction quality and maintenance have often been \npoor.11 The condition of these systems has declined, resulting in low efficiency and productivity. \nTraditional arrangements for irrigation management have also been undermined by decades of \ntop-down administrative control. The government lifted a restriction on irrigating non-rice crops \nin 2014. The potential now exists to operate existing systems more flexibly as storage systems, \nincreasing  water  utilization  and  diversifying  crop  production,  for  which  the  CDZ  has  a \ncomparative advantage over other areas in Myanmar. The four project districts of Magway, \nMeiktila, Shwebo, and Yamethin have a combined irrigable area of more than 75,000 ha, of \nwhich the project will cover about 20,000 ha (6% of the total irrigated area in CDZ).12 The \naverage annual cropping intensity of the subprojects studied under the project preparatory TA is \nbroadly typical of the CDZ. It ranges from 65% to 130% and averages 110%. These systems \nneed  to  be  rehabilitated,  modernized,  and  better  managed  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \n                                                \n8  Myanmar is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of pulses and beans, and third-largest for sesame after the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India. \n9  The CDZ covers more than 54,000 square kilometers, encompassing the lower Sagaing region, the central and \nwestern Mandalay region, and most of Magway region. It is home to more than 15.4 million people, accounting for \n25% of the country\u2019s population, 76% of whom live in rural areas. Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Immigration \nand Population. 2015. The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census: Volume 2. Nay Pyi Taw. \n10 Situated in the shadow of the Rakhine mountain range, the CDZ has an average annual rainfall of just 800 \nmillimeters. Rainfall is negligible during Myanmar\u2019s 6-month dry season and the effects of drought and dry spells \nare a key determinant of chronic poverty and food insecurity in the CDZ. Irrigation is needed to produce a dry \nseason crop and essential even for securing a good crop during the monsoon season rains.  \n11 Nationwide, there has been rapid construction of dams and irrigation coverage since the 1960s, and particularly \nafter 1990, but the currently developed area is still just over 20% of the potential area of about 10 million ha. \n12 The CDZ has a combined irrigated area of about 350,000 ha, 25% of the total irrigated area in Myanmar. Of 240 \nprojects built since 1998, 130 are located in the CDZ. Of these, 113 have reservoirs that make them relatively \nresilient to climate change. International Water Management Institute. 2013.

", "  3 \nLivestock, and Irrigation (MOALI) and the farmers to make them more flexible and responsive to \nthe farmers\u2019 requirements. \n \n8.  Climate vulnerability and mitigation. Myanmar is highly vulnerable to severe climate \nevents, particularly cyclones. Although conditions vary considerably between regions, climate \nchanges observed during 2005\u20132015 have included higher temperatures, higher rainfall, and \nincreased intensity of rains, with longer dry seasons and delays in the onset of the rainy season. \nThis trend suggests that in future, longer dry seasons and higher temperatures will increase \ncrop water requirements, but higher and more intense rainfall will increase runoff. All irrigation \nsystems covered by the project have reservoirs, which may allow storage of increased monsoon \nrunoff for subsequent use to increase cropping intensity. Overall, climate change is expected to \nhave a positive impact on crop intensities in reservoir-backed irrigation systems, but more \nintense rainfall and flood flows will need improved drainage infrastructure.  \n \n9.  Institutional  and  governance  reforms to improve water management.  Myanmar \nneeds to strengthen its institutional and legal framework for IWRM and irrigation management. \nIrrigation is still guided by the Burma Canal Act of 1905 and it is not covered by the 2006 \nConservation of Water Resources and Rivers Law, which focuses on river navigation and the \nrole of the Ministry of Transport. No national body exists to coordinate water resources, but the \nMOALI recognizes the need to continue developing policies, legislation, and institutions to \nstrengthen IWRM. In 2013, the Ministry of Transport received support from the Government of \nthe Netherlands to develop an IWRM strategy.13 An ADB TA is supporting the IWRM strategy \nthrough water allocation and water demand modeling in the Samon River Basin in the CDZ. 14 \nThese efforts should help to identify pathways to raising water productivity at the basin level. \nIrrigation service fees are currently set very low at MK1,950 per acre, and revenue flows are \nreduced by weak collection arrangements. Nevertheless, agricultural production and irrigation \nwater productivity can be increased by establishing key performance indicators related to crop \nareas  and  the  reliability,  timeliness,  and  equity  of  water  supply  and  by  introducing  asset \nmanagement systems for improved operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n10.  Government  strategy.  The current policy environment is favorable to medium-term \nagriculture sector growth, enhanced by agricultural policy liberalization and a raft of reforms and \nlegislation since 2011. The newly elected government sees agricultural development as critical \nto achieving inclusive growth, developing market mechanisms, creating social stability between \nagriculture-based  ethnic  communities,  and  accelerating  rural  development  and  poverty \nreduction. The government\u2019s 5\u2013year agriculture sector plan sets key objectives to improve \nirrigation and flood protection, crop production, and agro-industry; and to strengthen markets, \nhuman resource development, and research.15 It aims to increase cropping intensity to 160% \nand irrigated area to 2.25 million ha by 2021. In 2016, the former Ministry of Agriculture and \nIrrigation was merged with the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries, and Rural Development to create \nthe MOALI. A single ministry will be better able than its predecessors to coordinate whole farm \ndevelopment of crops, improvement of on-farm and nonfarm livelihoods, and promotion of value \nchains.  In  addition  to  contributing  to  the  5-year  plan  targets,  the  project  is  aligned  with \nMyanmar\u2019s long-term national comprehensive development plan and its rice sector development \n                                                \n13 P. van Meel et al.. 2014.

Consistent with the sector modality, the project \naddresses key aspects of Myanmar\u2019s  agriculture sector  5-year plan and associated sector \nstrategies (footnotes 15 and 16). It will support their implementation and help in developing \nrelevant  sector  policies  within  the  MOALI.  It  includes  components  that  will  help  diversify \nagriculture, modernize irrigation, promote private sector development, and enhance human \nresources. By targeting the CDZ, the project will focus on one of the most food-insecure, water-\nstressed, climate-sensitive, and natural resource-poor regions in Myanmar. Uncertain climatic \nconditions make well-functioning irrigation systems critical to successful crop production and \nsustaining the livelihoods of farmers and farm workers. Demand growth is strongest in the \ndiversification of crops such as oilseeds and pulses and commercial horticultural crops. When \ncombined with help to develop farmer associations and establish linkages with local private \nsector companies for improved market access, the cultivation of these crops offers the best \nprospects for boosting agricultural profitability.  \n \n12.  ADB experience and lessons learned. This will be the first ADB-financed irrigation \nproject  in  Myanmar  since  restarting  operations  in  2012,  but  ADB  regional  post-evaluation \nstudies indicate that, along with infrastructure improvements, the outcomes of irrigation projects \nare enhanced when combined with agricultural support services and comprehensive policy and \ninstitutional reforms to promote agricultural value chains. ADB irrigation projects have a mixed \ntrack  record  in  participatory  irrigation management  and management  transfer.  Recognizing \nthese lessons, the project will include a diagnostic assessment of agricultural diversification \noptions and a participatory assessment of system-wide irrigation modernization needs to inform \ntraining  programs  and  extension  needs.  It  will  include  a  revision  of  design  standards  as \nappropriate and consideration of financing options for O&M costs. Capacity building for MOALI\u2019s \nIrrigation and Water Utilization Management Department (IWUMD) and water users\u2019 groups \n(WUGs) will strengthen irrigation system management.  \n \n13.  Development  coordination.  Development  partners  such  as  AFD,  the  International \nFund for Agriculture Development, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World \nBank are reengaging in the agriculture sector in Myanmar. They are working with MOALI to \nintroduce regional and global best practices in the CDZ to achieve sustainable smallholder \nagriculture, irrigation, and rural development. Projects have complementary objectives and take \na  coherent  approach  to  sector  development  and  improvement  of  irrigated  and  rain-fed \nagriculture. Development partners avoid duplication by covering different areas of the CDZ, but \npromote consistency to ensure coordination, lesson sharing, and wide synergy. 17 \n \n14.  Alignment with ADB strategies and plans. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim \ncountry partnership strategy for 2012\u20132014 (extended to 2016)18 and the proposed country \npartnership strategy, 2017\u20132021 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \n2016\u20132018.

It is in line with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture \nand Natural Resources, 19 which calls on ADB to support value chain linkages and build climate \nchange  resilience  in  natural resources. It  supports  ADB\u2019s Water Operational  Plan,20 which \nfocuses on water use efficiency, enhancing agricultural water productivity and addressing IWRM. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.  The impacts of the project will be food security for domestic consumption and higher \nnutritional value by all citizens attained, socioeconomic status of rural people through increased \nagricultural productivity enhanced, and quality and standard of agricultural products to compete \nin international markets improved. These impacts are aligned with the government\u2019s midterm \nagriculture  sector  plan  (footnote  15).  The  outcome  will  be  income  increased  and  poverty \nreduced for rural populations in the project areas. \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1: Effective agricultural value chains in oilseeds, pulses, and horticultural \ncrops developed. To diversify agriculture and promote exports, the project will support farmers, \nlandless communities, and other key participants in the four project districts to develop and \npromote  agricultural  value  chains  for  oilseeds,  pulses,  and  horticultural  crops. 21  Key \ninterventions will include the (i) establishment of district-level hub frontline centers, to serve as a \nlink  between  government  and  private  sector,  with  provision  for  market  promotion  and \ncollaboration with commodity associations and chambers of commerce, development of market \ninformation systems, and facilitation of contract farming ventures with smallholder farmer groups \nand  cooperatives;  (ii)  establishment  of  irrigation  system-or  township-level  satellite  frontline \ncenters to support agricultural coordination committees (ACCs), through organization of farmer \nand producer groups, delivery of improved seed and inputs, provision of mechanization services, \nand post-harvest operations, and (iii) promotion of climate-smart agriculture. \n \n17.  Output 2: Reliability of agricultural water supplies improved and irrigated area \nincreased. The project will support rehabilitation, modernization, and improved management of \nabout five irrigation systems to improve the reliability of water supplies to about 20,000 ha22 of \nirrigated land within Magway, Meiktila, Shwebo, and Yamethin districts. It will (i) finance the \nplanning, design, supervision, civil works, and materials to improve irrigation infrastructure;23 \nand (ii) improve irrigation management from the township to the tertiary levels through capacity \nbuilding within the IWUMD, the ACCs and their subsidiary committees, and WUGs. Activities will \ninclude the introduction of asset management, improvement of reservoir operations, agricultural \nplanning,  and  irrigation  scheduling,  and  performance  monitoring. WUGs  will  be  developed \nincrementally starting from the existing farmer-led management arrangements. The project will \npromote active participation by irrigation system users in the design of infrastructure and provide \ngender-inclusive training on system O&M, water management, and governance. \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2015.

Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $78.44 million (Table 1). The government has requested \na loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR53,830,000 ($75 million) from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe loan agreement.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n21.  The grant-financed TA for Rural Productivity and Ecosystems Services Enhanced in \nCentral Dry Zone Forest Reserves will support improvement of integrated natural resources \nmanagement in forest reserves and permanent public forests in the CDZ. The TA is estimated \nto cost $5.32 million, of which $4.79 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Global \nEnvironment Facility and administered by ADB. The TA will be implemented over 5 years from \nMarch 2017 to March 2022. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ntechnical direction and guidance, support staff, hosting of the project management unit (PMU), \noffice supplies, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions.27 The TA will design \nand pilot-test training and capacity development packages in the Mae Nyo Taung forest reserve \nin Meiktila district and scale up good practices in an additional 5\u20137 forest reserve areas. The \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation will serve as the executing \nagency and work closely with the MOALI to ensure protection and sustainable management of \nthe catchments in the CDZ, mitigating erosion and associated sedimentation in irrigated areas.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n27 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8    \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  In accordance with the sector project approach, 11 potential irrigation subprojects were \nstudied in four CDZ districts under the project preparatory TA. Nine of these were ranked by \neconomic  viability  for  possible  inclusion  in  the  sector  project.  The  two  core  subprojects, \nNatmauk in Magway district and Chaungmagyi in Yamethin district, were taken to the feasibility \nstudy level based on their economic viability and technical feasibility. Additional subprojects, \nincluding the noncore subprojects, will be selected for project inclusion based on the selection \ncriteria in the PAM. The detailed design for the Chaungmagyi system is under way to advance \nproject  readiness  for  implementation.  Government  stakeholders,  WUGs,  and  farmers  will \nparticipate in the planning, design, construction, and management of the irrigation systems. \nConsultations with women will be emphasized to develop WUGs in gender-sensitive ways. \n23.  The identification, adaptation, and dissemination of farming technologies and knowledge \nsuited to enhancing agriculture in the CDZ will be key to achieving a successful project outcome. \nThis  will  involve  the  latest  technologies,  particularly  the  introduction  of  good  agricultural \npractices and climate-smart agriculture interventions incorporating efficient water management, \nimproved crop production technologies suited for the CDZ, including legume based farming \nsystems, cereal-legume crop rotations, drought and salinity resistant rice varieties, improved \ndrying  and  storage  facilities,  logistics  and  enhanced  private  sector  linkages.  The  frontline \ncenters will provide appropriate training, extension and farm advisory services based on the \nfarmers\u2019 needs and technical constraints, farming systems, and market opportunities. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Economic analyses were conducted for the two core subprojects. The investment costs \ncover value chain development and irrigation system rehabilitation and management. Several \nbenefit categories were quantified and assessed: (i) yield improvement, (ii) cropping pattern \nchanges, and (iii) cultivation area expansion. National reforms to be undertaken separately but \nconcurrent with project implementation will reduce transaction costs and losses during milling or \nprocessing and translate into higher profit margins for farmers, but this was not considered in \nthe economic analysis. On an incremental basis, the economic internal rate of return for the \nChaungmagyi subproject was estimated at 13.6% and that of Natmauk subproject at 16.8%.28  \n \n25.  Financial and sustainability analyses were conducted to determine the financial viability \nof the project. The government\u2019s annual costs for O&M were estimated to be 1.5% of total \nrehabilitation  costs,  or  $69,000  for  the  Chaungmagyi  system  and  $190,000  for  Natmauk. \nCurrent government O&M budgets are constrained and irregular, but analysis indicates that the \ngovernment could fund projected O&M expenses without creating a fiscal burden. The works \nimprovements under the project will substantially reduce O&M costs for the project systems. \nManagement efficiency enhancements at IWUMD, support for asset management, and the \nestablishment of WUGs will also contribute to reducing the overall O&M burden. Calculations of \nwith-  and  without-project  crop  budgets for  different commodities  indicated  that  overall, the \nproject will substantially increase the yields and net incomes of beneficiary farmers.  \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  Government accounting manuals and practices do not fully meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \n                                                \n28 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  9 \nThe financial management and procurement assessments noted that the MOALI\u2019s systems and \ncapacity are both weak. Internal audits are a relatively new requirement. To address these \nissues, a PMU will be established with dedicated procurement and financial support staff and \nproject-specific accounting systems to ensure accuracy in financial reporting. Training on ADB \nprocurement and disbursement policies and procedures will be conducted before project start-\nup. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. The specific project requirements are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Consistent with government poverty and social objectives, the project is expected to help \nsignificantly in reducing poverty in the project areas.29 Household incomes will be augmented \nfrom increases in the value of and returns from agricultural production and higher returns from \nlabor. Specialized good agricultural practice support will be provided to both female and male \nfarmers, and training will be conducted for the IWUMD, the Department of Agriculture, and \nfarmers. The project will create 2,500 person-years of direct employment during construction. \n \n28.  The project supports effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has been \nprepared to ensure that women have access to project benefits, including credit, technology, \nand markets.30  Women will make up at least 30% of all those receiving training, of participants \nin farmer field schools, and of the memberships of common interest groups and WUGs.  \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  The project is classified under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as category B \nfor environment. An environmental assessment review framework has been prepared to cover \nthe  project  areas  and  guide  the  preparation  and  assessment  of  subprojects. 31  Initial \nenvironmental examinations were prepared for the two core subprojects.32 Excessive use of \nfertilizer  and  pesticide  could  impact  drinking  water  sources  through  waste  disposal  and \nagricultural  drainage;  water  quality  will  therefore  be  monitored.  The  initial  environmental \nexaminations concluded that all adverse impacts associated with the project will be prevented, \neliminated, or minimized to an acceptable level if the mitigation and management measures \ndefined in the environmental management plans are properly implemented.  \n \n30.  The project is classified category B under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for \nboth involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (ethnic groups). A resettlement and ethnic \ngroups framework (REGF) was prepared to guide the preparation of resettlement and ethnic \ngroups plans or resettlement plans for individual subprojects, as appropriate.33 Due diligence \nwas  carried  out  for  the  two  core  subprojects  to  identify  potential  ethnic  minority  or  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Preliminary designs for these subprojects indicate that all \nworks will be within existing canal rights-of-way. Resettlement plans were not prepared at the \nfeasibility  stage  because  final  designs  will  be  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  during \nimplementation. A safeguards due diligence report has been prepared. The project may have \nminor involuntary resettlement impacts due to encroachment by farmers on land within existing \nsubproject rights-of-way. This may mean the temporary loss by such farmers of crops or assets \non these small areas. Compensation will be provided in accordance with the REGF. Since the \n                                                \n29 Project beneficiaries will include marginal landholders, sharecroppers, landless, and destitute women. \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement and Ethnic Groups Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10    \nlocations of the subsequent noncore subprojects have yet to be determined, small direct or \nindirect  but  so  far  unanticipated  impacts  on  ethnic  groups  may  arise.
