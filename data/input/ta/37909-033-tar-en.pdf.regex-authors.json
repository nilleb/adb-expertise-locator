", " \nI.  THE ONGOING PROGRAM \n \n1.  ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program (TFP) fills market gaps for trade finance by providing \nguarantees, loans, and risk participation products (both funded and unfunded) to banks to support \ntrade. It works with over 260 partner banks and operates in 21 developing member countries \n(DMCs). Since inception, it is estimated that TFP has supported almost 20,000 small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) through over 34,000 transactions valued at over $48 billion. In 2020, \nthe number of transactions supported by TFP increased by 49%, to 7,178 from 4,832 in 2019. \nThe value of transactions grew by 7%, to $5.8 billion from $5.4 billion in 2019. O \n  \n2.  The Supply Chain Finance Program (SCFP) works with corporates and partner financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) to enhance the access of SMEs to working capital and operates in 10 DMCs. \nIn 2020, the number of transactions supported by SCFP increased by 151% to 1,447 while the \nvalue of those transactions increased by 108% to $246 million. Of the 1,447 transactions in 2020, \n676 were estimated to support SMEs, a 51% increase over 2019.  \n \n3.  The two programs are complementary and were re-branded in 2020 into the Trade and \nSupply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) to leverage on TFP\u2019s existing relationships and achieve \noperational efficiencies and provide better client service. TSCFP is ADB\u2019s largest program and \ngenerator of co-financing, contributing a total of $3.1 billion short-term co-financing in 2020. \nMeanwhile, total TSCFP commitments amounted to $2.9 billion in the same year.   \n \n4.  TSCFP  is  central  to  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.1 Of  the  7,178 \ntransactions supported under TFP, 5,467 were COVID-related transactions worth $4.5 billion for \nthe purchase of goods such as test kits and medical equipment. These supported (i) companies \nthat provide essential services and (ii) financial intermediaries that provide direct financing to \nindividual companies, including SMEs, or facilitate local, regional, and global trade and related \nsupply chains that have been materially affected by the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout. Of the 1,447 \ntransactions supported under SCFP, 1,288 were COVID-related transactions worth $211 million. \nOf this, 1,058 transactions valued at $185 million provided support to the pharmaceutical sector, \nwith a particular focus on SMEs. Transactions to support the purchase and delivery of COVID-19 \nvaccines are being considered as part of the SCFP\u2019s 2021 operations.2  \n \n5.  TSCFP also encourages commercial sustainability by promoting sustainability in trade, \nensuring integrity and transparency, as well as helping accelerate progress in gender equality. In \naddition, TSCFP started supply chain finance capacity building activities in Georgia and produced \ntargeted knowledge products such as the COVID-19 supply chain tool,3 webinars about managing \nCOVID-19 trade finance risk and digitization, SCFP webinars, and enhanced online training. In \n2020, TSCFP conducted 10 webinars with over 1,200 participants.  \n \n \n1   ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2   In December 2020, a $500 million Vaccine Import Facility under the existing TFP program limit was developed to help developing \neconomies in Asia and the Pacific purchase vaccines and related equipment needed to fight COVID-19. The facility provides \nguarantees through the program\u2019s network of partner banks to support the purchase of vaccines, as well as glass vials, syringes, \nand equipment for cold chain storage facilities. Through risk sharing with partner banks, the $500 million facility can be leveraged \nto $1 billion.  \n3   A new tool https://www.adb.org/multimedia/scf/ was launched by TSCFP in May 2020 and published on the ADB website that maps, \nend-to-end, the entire supply chain for 33 critical pandemic-fighting goods, such as ventilators, N95 masks, etc. The tool helps \nbanks, investors and governments to ensure that companies have no bottlenecks and that financial support is there to ramp up \nsupply.  \n \nPUBLIC. This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "2   \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n6.  The Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility and the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund (RCIF) aim to (i) improve cross-border physical connectivity; \n(ii) increase trade and investment flows in DMCs from regional and nonregional economies, and \n(iii) preserve macroeconomic and financial stability in the region, among other goals. TSCFP \nhelps fulfil those aims by boosting trade, including among DMCs, and by building capacity in the \nregion so that DMCs can take advantage of global supply chains. More trade leads to increased \neconomic growth and jobs, cementing economic stability throughout the region.  \n \n7.  Trade finance is explicitly recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for \nDevelopment as an important means of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs).4 However, according to an ADB survey published in September 2019, the global trade \nfinance gap was $1.5 trillion, with more than 40% of rejected trade finance transactions coming \nfrom SMEs. Lowering the trade finance gap would help achieve SDGs, including those related to \ngender equality and economic growth.5 Thus, ADB, in accordance with Strategy 2030, will expand \nthe use and reach of the TSCFP.6  \n \n8.  The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge for many DMCs. It underscores \nthe need for critical trade support not only to move medical supplies but also to bolster economies. \nRegional cooperation is necessary to exchange knowledge, identify supply and financing gaps, \nand mobilize resources. TSCFP\u2019s high visibility, constant engagement with clients and delivery of \nknowledge products helps foster regional cooperation and integration. It is an excellent crisis \nresponse vehicle, with a global network of PFIs through which support can be channeled quickly \nand efficiently, including to SMEs impacted by the pandemic. \n \n9.  The proposed $1.25 million technical assistance (TA)7 will help TSCFP reduce market \ngaps for trade finance. The TA will fund the engagement of consultants (i) for business operations \nand administration to manage growing volumes, thereby complementing existing staff resources, \nand (ii) for various capacity building initiatives such as enhanced sustainability/safeguards, \nintegrity due diligence, and gender policies. To further close gaps, promote regional cooperation \nand integration and as a tool to address the pandemic, the TA will fund delivery of knowledge \nproducts, services, and solution in addition to transactions. \n \n10.  Sustainability Initiatives. The TA will build on work done under previous TFP TAs to \ncreate more awareness of and help address social and environmental issues such as child/forced \nlabor, climate change and sustainability through the banking sector, which is expected to also \nimpact banks\u2019 clients, including SMEs.8 TSCFP will conduct safeguards training and webinars to \ndeepen its partner banks\u2019 awareness and understanding of environmental and social safeguards \nand enhance their safeguards capacity. \n \n \n4  United Nations. 2015.

Unintended  consequences  of  anti-money-\nlaundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures contribute to market gaps. \nThe TA will support strengthening of AML/CFT practices by funding related online training and \npreparation for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Working Group on Trade-Based Money \nLaundering events in various DMCs. It will also improve monitoring of such issues by conducting \nintegrity due diligence reviews on all TSCFP partner banks and financial institutions. \n \n12.  Gender Initiatives. The TSCFP\u2019s gender initiative is in progress with human resource \npolicies of 19 partner banks in 8 DMCs reviewed to identify enhancements to attract, retain, \nand promote women in banking.9  Consultants will be engaged to implement future phases of this \ninitiative  including  expanding  to  more  banks  in  more  DMCs,  implement  complex \nrecommendations, develop, and implement guidelines, knowledge products or events for partner \nbanks on gender-related safeguard issues.  \n \n13.  Other Capacity Building and Knowledge Initiatives. The TA will fund other online \ntraining, regional conferences, webinars, and physical training and seminars, if possible post-\npandemic for DMC banks, SMEs, and government agencies, on topics related to trade and supply \nchain finance. TSCFP will continue its Twinning Program, which brings banks together within the \nregion to leverage their respective expertise and strengths to share and transfer knowledge. The \nTA will also fund TSCFP\u2019s Annual Awards and networking event that recognizes the most active \nbanks in trade finance, SME support, sustainable transactions, and gender initiatives.  \n \n14.
