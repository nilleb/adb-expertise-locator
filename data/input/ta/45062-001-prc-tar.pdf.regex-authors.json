INTRODUCTION \n1.  During an Asian Development Bank (ADB) country program mission to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) in December 2010, the government asked ADB to provide a policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve management and protection of the water resources of Boyang \nLake.1 The TA is in the PRC\u2019s COBP 2011\u20132013. The TA is consistent with the focus of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,2 which supports the strengthening \nof institutional capacity to protect the environment, mitigate climate change effects, and promote \nenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth. During an ADB mission on 12\u201316 April \n2011  to  prepare  the  TA  report,  the  government  concurred  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The limited availability and declining quality of water have become constraints to economic \ngrowth in the PRC. The government\u2019s no. 1 document of 20114 focuses on reforms and development \nin  water  conservancy.  It  emphasizes  the  importance  of  implementing  the  government\u2019s \nComprehensive National Water Resource Plan issued in December 2010. The size and strategic \necological  importance  of  Boyang  Lake  make  it  key  to  these  efforts.  It  is  the  country\u2019s  largest \nfreshwater  lake.  With  a  watershed  area  of  162,200  square  kilometers  in  Jiangxi  province,  it \ndischarges 145 billion cubic meters of fresh water into the Yangtze River each year, or about 15.6% of \ntotal runoff. The regular flow and quality of the waters of Boyang Lake affect economic development, \nlivelihoods, and health not only in Jiangxi but also in the vast downstream region of the PRC through \nwhich the Yangtze flows. Boyang Lake is also an important habitat for migratory birds and is listed \nunder the Ramsar Convention as an internationally important wetland. Keeping the lake\u2019s ecosystem \nhealthy is critical to the protection of the global environment and global biodiversity. On 12 December \n2009, the State Council of the PRC approved the plan, Ecological Economic Zone Planning for \nBoyang Lake, as a national strategy. This TA will support this planning effort, which is also a priority \nunder Jiangxi province\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, by developing a strategic framework to protect the \nwater resources and ecosystem of Boyang Lake. \n \n3.  Growing  pollution. Water quality and water flow in Boyang face several man-made and \nnatural threats. The discharge of wastewater from cities and industries into the lake and its major \ntributaries have deteriorated water quality and caused eutrophication. Although some urban areas and \nindustrial parks have established solid waste collection stations and wastewater treatment plants, \nmany urban areas still have no solid waste and wastewater treatment facilities. Monitoring data show \nthat water quality in the lake and its tributaries has been deteriorating since early 2000s. Major \npollutants include phosphorus, nitrates and nitrites, hydrocarbons, and fecal coliform bacteria.  \n \n4.  Poor monitoring. A lack of proper monitoring stations, staff skills, and resources has made \nmanagement of water resources and ecosystem in Jiangxi difficult. The province has 150 national and \nprovincial  water  quality  monitoring stations  on  rivers  and  25  on  lakes.  Water quality  monitoring \nstations are not always coinciding with water flow monitoring stations because of lack of coordination \namong various departments, which makes water quality projections and pollution control modeling \ndifficult. Because monitoring stations are not online, no early warning system exists for water pollution \nemergencies.  Monitoring  information  is  maintained  by  the  Jiangxi  provincial  department  of \nenvironment but is not easily accessible by outsiders. The Jiangxi provincial department of agriculture \n                                                \n1 The original title was Water Resources Ecosystem Protection of Yangtze River and Boyang Lake. \n2 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 June 2011. \n4 This document is the first government document issued in each year to prioritize governmental policies and strategies for \nthe coming year. \n ", "2   \nis responsible for monitoring irrigation water quality, nonpoint source pollution, wastewater and solid \nwaste management in rural areas, and biodiversity of lakes and reservoirs but rural monitoring is not \ncarried out regularly and data is also difficult for other departments to access. Although most industrial \nand urban wastewater treatment plants in the province self-monitor regularly and the resulting data \ncan be viewed online, this area of water resource and quality management still faces many problems, \nincluding (i) too few monitoring stations, compared with the large number of rivers and lakes and the \nexisting and expected industrial and urban wastewater treatment plants; (ii) inefficient and infrequent \nmonitoring, which must be done manually; (iii) a lack of monitoring capacity at city and county levels; \nand (iv) inadequate planning for industrial park wastewater treatment plants. \n \n5.  Declining water levels. Unusual changes in the water levels of Boyang Lake since 2004 have \ncaused uncertainty in water resource management. Water levels have dropped to record lows during \ndry seasons and the wetland areas have been shrinking. This has changed land and vegetation cover, \naffected human settlements, threatened biodiversity, and damaged the habitats of migratory birds. \nThese changes may be due to extreme weather events. A Ramsar report in 20105 noted that Boyang \nLake had undergone several cycles of drying and flooding during the history of human settlement in \nresponse to medium-term climate cycles. Research in 2007 showed that a cycle could last 11, 22, or \n30 years and would have strong temporary impacts on the wetland ecosystem and the watershed \nlandscape. The effects of this climatic variability and how they relate to land and water management \nacross the watershed require further investigation. This heightens the need to improve the inefficient \nwater resources management framework in Jiangxi province, which suffers from weak capacity in \nstrategic planning and implementation and poor coordination among the provincial departments of \nenvironmental protection, construction, agriculture, and forestry. \n \n6.  Jiangxi, two-thirds of which is hilly or mountainous, is an impoverished province. The provincial \ngross domestic product per capita was CNY17,300 in 2009, one-third less than the national average. \nAbout 5% of the population still lives below the national rural poverty income line of CNY1,196 a year. \nThe protection of the water resources of Boyang Lake will support the province\u2019s economic growth, \nprotect its ecosystem, and improve quality of life and livelihoods, especially for poor rural households. \nIt will also safeguard the water security of cities downstream on the Yangtze River.  \n \n7.  ADB has been supporting water resources management and biodiversity protection in the \nPRC for 2 decades through lending and TA. This has included assistance for forest ecosystem \nrehabilitation in Jiangxi province, reducing flood damages and economic losses in Hunan and the \nYellow River Basin, and improving water quality improvement and wetland protection in the Hai River \nEstuary, Jiaozhou Bay, and Jiangsu Yancheng. To strengthen the government\u2019s capacity to manage \nwater resources, ADB has been supporting integrated water resource management strategies in \nQingdao, Guiyang, and Chao Lake.6 This assistance has established the concept and practices of \n                                                \n5 M.

It has also introduced knowledge on how to adapt to climate change.  \n \n8.  The  establishment  through  the  TA  of  a  water  resource  management  framework  and \nimprovement of the provincial government\u2019s ability to manage the water resources of Boyang Lake will \nensure the sustainability of ongoing ADB investment projects in forest ecosystem rehabilitation and \nurban infrastructure improvement in the province.7 The knowledge gained from the TA will benefit \nwatershed management of other lakes in the PRC, such as Tai Lake and Dongting Lake, and in other \ndeveloping countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The  TA  will  help  the  Jiangxi  provincial  government  (i)  prepare  a  strategic  framework  to \nimprove the management of the water resources of Boyang Lake and mainstream climate change risk \nmanagement in water resource management policies and practices, and (ii) improve its institutional \ncapacity in water resource management and climate change risk management. By doing so, the TA \naims to address following challenges in the management of water resources of Boyang Lake: (i) the \nincreasing discharge of pollutants into the lake and its tributaries, (ii) an underdeveloped water quality \nmonitoring network and database, (iii) the risks posed to water resources management by climate \nchange, and (iv) a weak institutional framework for water resources management in Jiangxi province. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  After completion of the TA, the Jiangxi government will implement a strategic policy framework \nto reduce the amount of pollution discharged into Boyang Lake and the Gan, Fu, Xin, Rao, and Xiu \nrivers. The expected impact will be improved management of water resources in Jiangxi province. The \nwater quality will be maintained at or above class III standard at 90% of the monitoring stations on the \nfive rivers and Boyang Lake by 2020, compared with 80% in 2010. The outcome of the TA will be an \nimproved strategic framework for water resource management for Boyang Lake. Government officials \nwill  increase  their  knowledge  and  skills  for  managing  the  water  resources  and  protecting  the \necosystem of Boyang Lake. \n \nB.
