I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Nauru for the Public Financial Management Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The program aims to support the government\u2019s longer-term development objectives of \nimproving the living standards of the people of Nauru through the government delivering more \nefficient and equitable social services. This two-tranche program grant totals $4 million. The \nfirst tranche of $2 million will be disbursed upon grant effectiveness as all first tranche policy \nactions have been accomplished. The second tranche of $2 million will be available after \naccomplishing the policy actions for the second tranche, projected to be achieved in 1 year.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Nauru faces many serious development challenges, with almost no private sector, no \nbanking services, little arable land, limited fresh water supply, extremely high levels of debt, \nand inadequate sources of government revenue. Education outcomes are improving but are \nstill poor by international standards and have contributed to high rates of youth unemployment. \nThere are comparatively few experienced persons to take on key management roles in the \npublic sector. Levels of noncommunicable diseases (i.e., diabetes and cancer) are among the \nhighest in the world. There is an urgent need to improve health and education service delivery, \nset standards and targets, and measure progress. A healthy and better educated population \nwill be able to take greater advantage of job opportunities locally and abroad. That Nauru has \nbeen invited to join Australia\u2019s2 and New Zealand\u2019s seasonal worker schemes could have a \npositive effect on household incomes and the standard of living of the population at large. \n \n4.  Nauru  remains  vulnerable  to  the  current  uncertainty  in  the  global  economy.  The \ngovernment  generates  budget  revenues  from  (i)  dividends  and  returns  from  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), mainly from phosphate mining, processing, and export; (ii) customs duties; \n(iii) fishing license fees; (iv) petroleum sales; (v) other nontax revenues such as hotel taxes and \nairport charges; and (vi) budget support from development partners.3 Tax-based revenues are \nlimited  due  to  the  country\u2019s  narrow  economic  base.  Currently,  Nauru  has  no  legislation \nauthorizing taxation of businesses or households. Tax revenues are limited to customs duties \nand excises. Nauru\u2019s limited and volatile revenues, like fishing licenses and phosphate-related \npayments, continue to be difficult to forecast, and both are subject to forces beyond the control \nof the government. The country is highly dependent on external assistance to meet essential \nneeds, with domestic revenue accounting for only 42% of total expenditure in FY 2011. \n \n5.  Since phosphate mining and exports are the domain of SOEs,4 the Nauruan economy is \ndominated by the public sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. \nRepublic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation (RONPHOS), responsible for the processing and \nexport of phosphate, has been unable to pay its projected dividends to the government and \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  On 20 June 2012, Nauru signed a memorandum of understanding with Australia to become the first country to \nparticipate in the formal Pacific Seasonal Worker Scheme. \n3  Domestic revenues are approximately A$27.2 million, of which 32% are customs duties and excises, 30% are \nphosphate revenues, and 20% are fishing license revenues. \n4  Nauru Rehabilitation Corporation is responsible for mining phosphate and rehabilitating previously mined areas \nwhereas RONPHOS is responsible for phosphate processing and export. ", "2 \nwas without a chief executive officer since 2008. The supply of electricity, water, and fuel was \npreviously provided by the Nauru Phosphate Company and subsequently by the Nauru Utilities \nAuthority  (NUA),  an  unincorporated  government  entity.  NUA\u2019s  uncertain  legal  status  has \nhampered its ability to manage its staff resources effectively. Poor asset management has led \nto frequent power outages. NUA has also required large fuel subsidies. \n \n6.  Private sector activity is minimal. In addition to phosphate, other possible industries \ninclude  niche  tourism,  commercial  tuna  fishing,  and  the  manufacture  of  dolomite  tiles.5 \nAustralia, in a recent review of its development assistance, acknowledged that the growth \nprospects of Pacific microstates such as Nauru were limited. The review also prioritized plans \nto considerably increase development assistance to microstates to offset the lack of private \nsector activity.6 Much of this assistance is to be delivered through program-based approaches, \nwhich will require an improvement in these countries\u2019 public financial management (PFM) \ncapabilities.7 \n \n7.  A recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, prepared \nunder an Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance (TA),8 identified several \nshortcomings of Nauru\u2019s PFM system. Particular areas of concern are poor internal controls, an \ninadequate regulatory framework for procurements, and unsustainable debt levels.  \n \n8.  The overall standard of internal controls is weak. Although expenditure controls are \nstrong, other internal controls prescribed in the accounting and budget manual, last revised in \n1979, are weak and inconsistent with current practices. There are no financial regulations that \ngovern internal controls. \n \n9.  The regulatory framework for procurements is not enforceable due to the lack of specific \nregulations. It is also deficient in defining procurement procedures for SOEs and government \nagencies, and does not define minimum requirements for competitive tenders, quotes, or other \nprocurement processes. The framework is not transparent and lacks a complaints mechanism.  \n \n10.  ADB categorizes Nauru at high risk of debt distress. Its external debt level is high at \nover 95% of gross domestic product. The overall level of indebtedness (including external and \ninternal debt) has been reduced by 14% over the past 5 years to A$549.0 million, largely due to \nwrite-downs and debt relief. Internal debt amounts to A$480.7 million and external debt to \nA$68.8 million of the outstanding balance. \n \n11.  Nauru\u2019s PFM system is still largely paper-based and makes use of Excel spreadsheets. \nThis system adds considerable time and complexity to budgeting and increases the risk of \nbudget overspending. Public finance, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics are \neither unavailable or out of date. \n \n12.  Nauru has large social and economic infrastructure needs, not least for a new port and \na hospital. External funding for these projects will hinge on the preparation of a credible, \nbudgeted, and prioritized strategic infrastructure development plan.  \n \n13.  Nauru has no national women\u2019s policy and until June 2011, had been one of the last \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007. Nauru Country Economic Report.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nseven countries in the world not to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms  of  Discrimination  against  Women  (CEDAW).  There  is  little  awareness  of  gender-\nsensitive budgeting issues in Nauru and women are generally underrepresented in economic \ndecision-making bodies. \n \n14.  To correct the above shortcomings, the government has embarked on a major PFM \nreform as expressed in a PFM action plan, prepared under ADB TA (footnote 8), and underpins \nthis program. The proposed program will support the government\u2019s efforts to (i) improve its \nfiscal performance, (ii) strengthen corporate governance and performance of key SOEs, and \n(iii) bolster the legal and policy framework for equitable access to social services. Efficient \npublic financial and fiscal management will result in better development outcomes in Nauru, \nwhere dependence on official development assistance will persist in the medium-to-long term.  \n \n15.  The program will strengthen public sector effectiveness, a priority under ADB\u2019s Pacific \nApproach, 2010\u20132014.9 The program also supports implementing the National Sustainable \nDevelopment  Strategy,10 which  emphasizes  sustainable  fiscal  management.  It  envisions \nestablishment of a new trust fund, which ADB has assisted in the design of, to save some \ncurrent revenues for future generations.11 The program was developed in consultation with the \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID), which is Nauru\u2019s largest bilateral \ndevelopment partner. Ongoing dialogue with the government, the Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Center (PFTAC), and the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center (PIAC),12 has been \ncentral to the preparation of the program. ADB is providing TA to the government in the areas \nof  PEFA,  PFM  action  plan,  and  more  rigorous  corporate  governance  for  NUA  and \nRONPHOS.13 PIAC  provided  assistance  to  formulate  the  Nauru  Economic  Infrastructure \nStrategy and Investment Plan. AusAID provides assistance through resident advisors and TA in \nthe  areas  of  (i)  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS),  (ii)  revenue  policy  and \nadministration, and (iii) reforms in the education and health sectors. PFTAC supports reforms \nof financial instructions and the preparation of balance of payments and national accounts \nstatistics. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be higher living standards of the population of Nauru. The outcome will \nbe the delivery of improved equitable social services by the government. Better social service \ndelivery  will  lead  to  better  health  and  education  outcomes,  which  will  promote  greater \nparticipation of Nauruans in income-generating activities both domestically and abroad. The \nprogram will be structured in two tranches with two sets of policy actions to be accomplished by \nthe end of July 2012 and the end of August 2013, respectively. All of the 12 policy actions, 5 of \nwhich are triggers for the first tranche release, have been completed. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009.

The program will have three outputs: (i) stronger public financial management, (ii) more \nrigorous  corporate  governance  and  economic  performance  of  selected  SOEs,  and  (iii) a \ncomprehensive legal and policy framework for equitable access to social services. These \noutputs will improve the delivery of social services by increasing the resources available for \nthem as well as improving the equity and efficiency of their use.  \n \n18.  Output 1: Stronger public financial management by the Ministry of Finance. The \nprogram will rectify weaknesses specified in the 2011 PEFA assessment for Nauru.14 Policy \nactions under output 1 are in accordance with the government\u2019s PFM action plan and include \n(i) revenue management, (ii) budget and planning processes, and (iii) overall financial and \nofficial development assistance management.  \n \n19.  Revenue management. The 2011 PFM action plan recommended (i) the establishment \nof a national revenue office to improve revenue collection and administration, and (ii) the \nbroadening of the tax base. Under tranche 1, a revenue office was established in September \n2011. For tranche 2, the government will adopt a new taxation policy framework including \nmeasures to broaden the tax base.  \n \n20.  Budget and planning processes. A key recommendation of the PFM action plan, \ndeveloped under ADB regional TA (footnote 8), is the replacement of the current financial \nmanagement system (based on paper and Excel spreadsheets) with a full electronic FMIS \n(computerized accounting system). Under tranche 1, the government established the FMIS with \nassistance from AusAID in September 2011. The FMIS\u2014Technology One Financials\u2014will \nensure stronger financial management and accounting capability. The system will reduce both \nthe amount of paperwork and time required for the budget and expenditure approvals. In \naddition, all expenditure commitments and actual payments can be simultaneously taken into \naccount when the assessment is done. If a particular line item has low payments against it but \nhas  high  commitments  that  result  in  insufficient  budget  being  available  for  a  proposed \npurchase, the system will not allow the purchase requisition to be processed. This greatly \nreduces the risk of overspending against the approved budget. The FMIS has four modules: (i) \ngeneral ledger, (ii) accounts payable, (iii) accounts receivable, and (iv) purchasing. Since the \nFMIS went live on 7 September 2011, progress has been steady. The FMIS was initially \nintroduced in the finance, education, and health ministries, and the Chief Justice\u2019s Department.  \n \n21.  Senior  government  officials  will  develop  awareness  and  understanding  of  gender-\nresponsive  budgeting  processes  and  requirements.  This  will  improve  equitable  budget \nallocations and expenditures. As part of tranche 2, all members of the National Development \nCommittee will be accustomed to gender-sensitive budgeting through tabling and discussion of \nan issues paper at meetings of the committee. Such heightened awareness will complement \ngender-related reforms to legal and policy frameworks and increase the likelihood of their \neffective implementation. \n \n22.  Under  tranche  1,  the  government  adopted  the  National  Economic  Infrastructure \nStrategy and Investment Plan in February 2012, which was developed with the assistance of \nPIAC, and will implement this plan under tranche 2. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2011. Nauru: Public Financial Management Performance Report. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 6507-\nREG). \n ", "5 \n23.  Under tranche 1, the program supported the publication of historical national accounts \nand balance of payments statistics for 2004\u20132009 in February 2012. Under tranche 2, the \nprogram includes (i) the publication of national accounts and balance of payments data for \n2010\u20132011, and (ii) the conduct of a census and a household income and expenditure survey. \n \n24.  Overall  financial  and  aid  management. PFTAC drafted a revised  set of financial \ninstructions, incorporating more effective internal controls. Under tranche 2, the program will \nsupport the further development and adoption of these instructions taking into account changes \nfrom the introduction of the FMIS.  \n \n25.  The government developed and approved a new procurement policy under tranche 1 in \nMay 2012. This new policy and guidelines will require the centralization and outsourcing of all \ngovernment and SOE procurement above A$5,000 to an independent, external agency. Under \ntranche  2,  the  government  will  implement  the  new  procurement  policy  and  guidelines  by \ncontracting an external procurement agency. Dedicated Nauruan officials will be appointed to \nwork with the external agency and at the warehouse. AusAID will provide capacity development \nTA to assist the government in adequately overseeing the performance of the external agency \nin FY2013.15 \n \n26.  The  government  is  also  accelerating  the  outsourcing  of  the  bulk  procurement  of \npetroleum for the country. Potential benefits of this arrangement include (i) cost savings and \nadditional revenues for the national budget, (ii) better security and quality of fuel supply, and \n(iii) competitive prices for the local market. Prior to entering into such an arrangement, the \ngovernment will conduct a detailed cost\u2013benefit analysis in which ADB will participate. \n \n27.  An updated debt strategy, developed with the assistance of ADB regional TA, provides \nrevised debt figures and recommendations for the government on managing internal debt. This \nincludes the liquidation of the Bank of Nauru, which accounts for 90% of internal debt. Under \ntranche 1, the government adopted an updated debt management strategy in February 2012. \nUnder tranche 2, the government will advance the liquidation of the Bank of Nauru through \nagreement of a settlement with depositors.  \n \n28.  Output 2: More rigorous corporate governance and economic performance of \nselected  state-owned  enterprises.  The  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  effort  to \nimprove the corporate governance and performance of two key SOEs\u2014NUA and RONPHOS\u2014\nassisted  by  ADB  TA  (footnote  13).  The  program  will  support  the  corporatization  and \ncommercialization of NUA to improve its corporate governance and economic performance. \nUnder tranche 1, NUA was corporatized through the passage of an act establishing the Nauru \nUtilities  Corporation  (NUC)  in  July  2011.  Under  tranche  2,  NUC  will  be  gradually \ncommercialized through the use of performance-based contracts for senior management.  \n \n29.   A  recent  review 16  recommended  the  following  actions  to  improve  RONPHOS\u2019s \nperformance:  (i)  a  new  corporate  structure  with  an  executive  team  comprising  the  chief \nexecutive officer, an operations manager, and a corporate manager; and (ii) legislative changes \nto separate governance from management. Under tranche 1, a chief executive officer was \nrecruited  to  focus  on  strategic  issues  in  September  2011,  including  the  preparation  of  a \nbusiness plan and the implementation of a performance management system. Under tranche 2, \n                                                 \n15 AusAID. 2012. Review of Government of Nauru\u2019s Procurement Policy Framework. Canberra. \n16 ADB. 2011.

Manila (TA 7430-REG; \nsenior executive management structure for RONPHOS, including revisions to its governance and legislation). \n ", "6 \nthe RONPHOS Act will be amended to better separate governance from management.  \n \n30.  Women have generally been underrepresented on SOE boards that provide essential \nservices and generate much of the country\u2019s income. Under tranche 2, the government will \nappoint at least one qualified woman each to the majority of SOE boards. \n \n31.  Output  3:  Enhanced  legal  and  policy  framework  for  equitable  social  service \ndelivery. Equitable social service delivery will be improved through (i) a new education act \nrequiring compulsory secondary education for males and females; (ii) an education re-entry \nprogram including support for single mothers; (iii) adoption of detailed sector strategies for \nhealth and education; and (iv) adoption of a national women\u2019s policy and CEDAW plan of \naction.  \n \n32.  Under tranche 1, detailed sector strategies were introduced for health and education by \nJuly 2011, which include numerical targets for enrollments, completion rates, infant mortality \nrates, and maternal health. This has already begun to pay dividends in improving education \nservice delivery. \n \n33.  Nauruan  women,  like  their  male  counterparts,  have  low  secondary  education \ncompletion rates (less than 20%). This limits access to jobs in Nauru and abroad. Under \ntranche 1, the Parliament passed the Education Act in July 2011, which makes primary and \nsecondary education compulsory for children aged 6\u201318 years. For tranche 2, the government \nis preparing a re-entry program for school dropouts that will enable single mothers to re-enter \nthe education system.   \n \n34.  The Constitution gives equal rights to women and men. Under tranche 1, Nauru ratified \nCEDAW in June 2011. For tranche 2, the government is preparing a legal review for CEDAW \ncompliance, with a plan to finalize the review report in 2013. A national women\u2019s policy and \nCEDAW implementation plan of action are also under preparation for tranche 2 by the Ministry \nof Home Affairs and are expected to be adopted by August 2013.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n35.  The government requested a grant not exceeding $4.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the program. The grant size was determined based on the \nadjustment  costs  for  the  proposed  reforms,  which  include  implementation  of  the  FMIS, \noutsourcing government procurement, more spending on health and education under new \nsector  strategies,  establishment  of  a  revenue  office,  cost  of  corporatizing  NUA,  and \nestablishment of a performance management system for key SOEs. The government has \nspecified that a portion of the tranche 2 grant proceeds may be put aside to fund future social \nservice delivery. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n36.  The program will be implemented over 34 months, from June 2011 to April 2014, with \npost-program monitoring continuing to September 2014. Nauru is classified as at high risk of \ndebt distress and is therefore eligible to receive 100% grant assistance. The grant will be \nprovided  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $2  million  will  be  available  upon  grant \neffectiveness as all the policy actions for the first tranche have been accomplished. The second \ntranche of $2 million will be available upon as the government accomplishes the policy actions \nfor the second  tranche, projected to be achieved by August 2013. \n ", "7 \n37.  The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed to Nauru as the recipient according to \nADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures.17 The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries; items in the list of ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded.18 Grant proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the \nvalue of the total imports of Nauru, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is greater than the \namount of the grant to be disbursed during a particular year. Local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the grants will be used to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \n38.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency and will oversee policy, \nlegal, and regulatory actions and ensure that the agreed policy actions are duly carried out. The \nMOF will also be responsible for the overall implementation of the program, including carrying \nout all policy actions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program \nrecords. The MOF will (i) establish and maintain a performance evaluation system for the \nprogram, which will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and \npolicy matrix; and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, on an semiannual basis over the term of the \nprogram, the implementation of policy actions and their impact on program outcome, in line \nwith the program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon. Specific policy actions will also \nbe implemented by the NUC, RONPHOS, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the \nMinistry of Education, and the Ministry of Home Affairs.  \n \n39.  The  government  will  continue  to  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \ndiscussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for program \nimplementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  MOF  and  key  development  partners,  will  undertake \nregular reviews of program performance. The reviews will evaluate implementation of the policy \nreform measures and assess the impact, describe lessons learned during the program period, \nand outline policy actions and any assistance needed for sustained and inclusive economic \ngrowth. The program design has drawn on dialogue with civil society, such as the Nauru \nPrivate  Business  Sector  Organization  and  Nauru  Island  Association  of  Nongovernment \nOrganizations. During implementation, ADB will continue consultation with civil society. \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements\nImplementation period  June 2011\u2013April 2014 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2014 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  NDC: Chief Secretary (chair), Secretaries for Finance, Home Affairs, Health, \nand Education, Chief Executive Officers for RONPHOS and NUC (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  MOF \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MOF, NUC, RONPHOS, and ministries of education; health; and home affairs \n(iv)  Implementation unit  n/a \nProcurement  n/a \nConsulting services  n/a \nDisbursement  The $4.0 million policy-based grant will be disbursed in two tranches: \nTranche 1: $2.0 million \nTranche 2: $2.0 million \nMOF = Ministry of Finance, n/a = not applicable, NDC = National Development Committee, NUC = Nauru Utilities \nCorporation, RONPHOS = Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation, TBD = to be decided. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1998.

Short- and medium-term growth prospects depend on developments in the phosphate \nindustry.  Since  the  resumption  of  phosphate  exports  in  2007,19 phosphate  mining  and \nprocessing (included in manufacturing) has regained its prominence in the Nauru economy and \nin FY2009, accounted for almost 40% of gross domestic product. Primary phosphate reserves \nare estimated to be enough for 1\u20132 years of production, and deeper, secondary reserves are \nexpected to last 20 years. Some increase in phosphate exports is now taking place; phosphate \nexports of 385,000 tons were achieved for FY2011 compared with 17,200 tons in FY2006, the \nfirst year after the resumption of phosphate exports, and 319,000 tons in FY2010. The world \nphosphate rock market has improved after declining in FY2009. The long-term outlook is \nfavorable at present and demand is expected to continue to grow at an average rate of around \n3% per annum during the 10-year period 2011\u20132020. Recently improved phosphate-loading \nfacilities and stronger management of RONPHOS are expected to lift phosphate exports to \nover 500,000 tons in FY2012, taking economic growth to 4.8% in FY2012 and 4.2% in FY2013. \n \nB.  Governance \n41.  Public financial management. The quality of PFM has improved in recent years. The \ngovernment\u2019s  recent  major  reform  initiative  has  been  the  adoption and  maintenance  of a \nprudent fiscal management strategy, first initiated in 2004. The government\u2019s conservative \nfiscal strategy has ended a long period of fiscal mismanagement and stabilized its financial \nposition.  This  strategy  has  included  achieving  a  balanced  budget,  directing  government \nexpenditure to the provision of basic services, starting to widen the government\u2019s revenue \nbase, stabilizing its very high debt position through debt write-offs and negotiated settlements \nwith creditors, and reducing the size of the public service and the value of subsidies provided to \npublic enterprises. Donors have contributed a high level of TA in several PFM areas since 2008 \ndue to weak capacity levels within the government. Weaknesses remain, however, in public \nsector financial management, which are adversely affecting public service delivery, threatening \naggregate fiscal discipline, and undermining the strategic allocation of public resources. The \nlimited  medium-term  focus  in  budgeting,  weak  internal  control  systems  (especially  in \nprocurement and internal audit), and low accounting standards represent major constraints to \nthe delivery of basic services. The absence of government financial statements has prevented \nstakeholder scrutiny that would normally assist the review of sector budgetary allocations and \nservice delivery performance levels. The government has prepared a PFM action plan following \non from the PEFA assessment in 2011. \n \n42.  Anticorruption efforts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOF  and  forms  part  of  the  legal \ndocuments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. These measures \nwill  complement  anticorruption  measures  and  actions  under  way  to  improve  financial \naccountability.  Key  actions  relate  to  the  revision  of  financial  management  systems,  the \nrefinement of financial instructions and the improvement of procurement practices. \n                                                 \n19  Phosphate exports had ceased in the early 2000s due to poor infrastructure and lack of demand but resumed in \n2007 following an agreement between Nauru and the Australian fertilizer company, Incitec Pivot, to refurbish the \nfacility. \n ", "9 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n43.  The program will contribute to poverty reduction and social development through the \nfollowing  key  program  components.  More  rigorous  corporate  governance  and  economic \nperformance  of  SOEs  will  lead  to  (i)  more  phosphate  revenues,  which  will  provide  more \nresources for social service delivery and poverty reduction; (ii) reduced transfers of scarce \npublic  resources  to  SOEs,  which  will  free  revenues  for  use  in  more  activities  related  to \ndevelopment and poverty reduction; and (iii) more efficient and equitable service delivery from \nNUC. Stronger PFM will lead to (i) better value for money in procurement, which will free up \nmore government resources; (ii) strengthened tax administration, which will increase revenue \navailable to the government for social service delivery; (iii) better tracking and accountability of \ngovernment funds through a new FMIS; and (iv) reduced debt burden on the country through a \ndebt management strategy and liquidation of the Bank of Nauru. \n \n44.  The program is anchored to the National Sustainable Development Strategy, which the \ngovernment developed through a consultative process. Priority services to be supported under \nthe program are derived from consultation with the ministries of commerce, industries, and \nenvironment; education; finance; health; and home affairs and reflect their respective priorities \nand budget positions.  \n \n45.  There will also be economic empowerment of women through greater representation on \nSOE boards and greater awareness of gender-sensitive budget issues. Social service delivery \nwill be made more equitable through (i) the Education Act that requires compulsory secondary \neducation for males and females; (ii) an education re-entry program that includes support for \nsingle mothers; (iii) implementation of detailed sector strategies for health and education that \ninclude numerical targets for enrollments, completion rates, infant mortality rates, and maternal \nhealth; and (iv) adoption of a national women\u2019s policy and CEDAW plan of action.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n46.  Program activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms and none of the \nactivities will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples issues. Thus, \nthe program is category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nNo adverse environmental impacts have been identified. Public consultation was carried out \nduring program preparation.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n47.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 Key risks in the program revolve around \nweak  local  capacity  and  political  instability.  This  grant  has  been  developed  under  three \nseparate governments in Nauru. ADB has maintained a high level of consultation with the \ngovernment, the opposition, and other stakeholders during processing and this will continue to \nbe a feature of the grant during implementation.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures\nWeak capacity of government  TA will be provided in coordination with other development partners to assist the \nagencies to implement  government in implementing reforms.

ASSURANCES  \n48.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program will \nconform with all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant documents. The government and MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the program, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n49.
