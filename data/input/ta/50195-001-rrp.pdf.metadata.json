THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nof up to $195 million (or Indian rupee equivalent), in aggregate, to seven special purpose \nvehicles (SPVs) owned and controlled by ReNew Power Ventures Private Limited (ReNew) for \nthe  ReNew  Clean  Energy  Project  in  India.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of loans of up to $195 million, in aggregate, to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Fund1 (LEAP) for the ReNew Clean Energy Project in India. If the \nBoard approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the LEAP loans. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The Government of India has established ambitious renewable energy targets in the \ncountry\u2019s electricity-generation mix: 175 gigawatts of capacity from renewable resources by 2022, \nof which about 91% will come from solar and wind. Since 2007, ADB has supported several \nnonsovereign projects encompassing multiple segments of the renewable energy value chain, \nfrom  generation  to  transmission.  One  such  project  in  2014  involved  an  early-stage  equity \ninvestment into ReNew, an independent power producer and renewable energy developer in \nIndia, to help the company expand its scale of operations.2 As ReNew executes its growth plan, \nwhich  includes  diversification  of  its  portfolio  across  states,  offtakers,  and  technologies,  it \nrequires debt financing for several of its solar and wind projects and has requested ADB to \ncatalyze funding.   \n \n2.  Project Design  \n \n3.  The  project  involves  the  construction  of  398  megawatts  (MW)  of  solar  power  and \n311 MW of wind power subprojects across six states. Of this, 255 MW of solar subprojects will \nbe located in Jharkhand in eastern India, representing ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign exposure to \nwhat is one of India\u2019s less-developed states. ADB will provide a nonsovereign loan from its \nordinary capital resources, along with a loan from the ADB-administered LEAP (together the \n\u201cfacilities\u201d), to seven SPVs that were established for executing the subprojects in the states of \nAndhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana, each having \n(or required to have) a 25-year power purchase agreement. The project will be the first ADB \ntransaction to catalyze LEAP funding. The facilities will be structured as separate loans to each of \nthe seven SPVs on a project finance basis (Table 1).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1 Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2 ADB. 2014.

ReNew  was  established  in  2011  with  a  vision  of  creating  a  best-in-class \nrenewable energy company for the development of wind and solar power projects in India. \nSumant Sinha, former chief financial officer of Suzlon, founded the company. Since its inception, \nReNew has commissioned 1,167 MW of operational capacity as of 31 August 2016 (933 MW of \nwind and 234 MW of solar). As of August 2016, it has over 1.5 gigawatts of its renewable pipeline \nunder construction or in early development, i.e., over 600 MW of wind farms and over 900 MW of \nsolar  capacity.

(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy). \n \n10.  Integrity assessment. Integrity due diligence (IDD) was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s IDD Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations3 and included analyses of the integrity risks \nposed because ReNew\u2019s shareholding structure involves several intermediate jurisdictions. The \nresults of these analyses are set out in the IDD disclosure document.4 None of the countries \ninvolved in ReNew\u2019s shareholding structure is listed by the Financial Action Task Force as being \na strategically deficient jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s review of (Confidential information redacted under \npara. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) does not give ADB cause to believe that \neither entity or the SPVs have been established, or are being used for cross-border tax evasion, \nmoney laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  Impact. The project's impact will be in the form of continued diversification of India\u2019s \nenergy mix via the addition of renewable energy capacity, providing the country with a secure, \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2015.

The project also contributes to the acceleration and expansion of private \nsector investments in, and scaling up of, clean energy infrastructure in India.  \n \n12.  Outcome.  The  project's  outcome  will  be  increased  renewable  energy  capacity \ndeveloped and operated by the private sector. The project will generate 1,400 gigawatt-hours of \nclean energy per annum and contribute to avoiding 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions \nannually from 2018 onward. \n \n13.  Outputs. The project outputs are the development and commissioning of 398 MW of \nsolar power and 311 MW of wind power for an aggregate of 709 MW of generating capacity by \n2018, and generation of local employment opportunities in support of the project. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n14.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure and environment, two of the five core operational areas of ADB, as reaffirmed by \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.5 The project also supports three of the five key thrusts of \nthe country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India: (i) infrastructure development, (ii) job \ncreation and access to jobs, and (iii) environmental sustainability.6 \n \n15.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB's Energy Policy,7 which states that support for renewable energy projects \nwill be prioritized and broadened. In September 2015, ADB announced that it would double its \nannual climate financings to $6 billion by 2020, including $4 billion annually for mitigation. Of \nthis annual amount, $3 billion would target clean energy projects such as solar (as well as wind, \ntransmission, smart grids, and other technologies).8 \n \n16.  Lessons from previous operations. Extended annual reviews of renewable energy \nprojects in India previously financed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department indicated \nthat successful project implementation depends on the strength of the sponsor and its ability to \nunderstand the regulatory environment, and the terms and conditions governing the financing of \nsuch projects. Other lessons, that are not sector-specific, pertain to issues such as a long-term \nforeign  exchange  hedging  strategy  and  coordination  with  domestic  cofinanciers.  ADB  is \nconfident that ReNew can successfully implement the project given its past track record, while \nthe other lessons will be taken into account in the execution of the project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2014.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Table 5 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The policies that govern renewable energy in India consist of the following, in order of \nprecedence: (i) the Electricity Act of 2003; (ii) the National Electricity Policy of 2005; and (iii) \nthe Tariff Policy of 2006.  \nManagement  ReNew is led by Sumant Sinha, its founder and chief executive officer. ReNew\u2019s board is \nrepresented by investors with significant domain expertise in the infrastructure and renewable \nenergy industries. ADB is an equity shareholder and holds a seat on the board. ReNew\u2019s \nmanagement team comprises specialists with significant experience in India\u2019s power sector. \nDue diligence  ADB appointed Lahmeyer (India) International Limited as the lender's independent engineer \n(LIE) for the two Telangana solar subprojects, and L&T Sargent & Lundy as LIE for the \nKarnataka wind subproject. Technical due diligence, including estimation of the energy yield, \nwas completed for one solar subproject (ReNew Mega Solar Power Private Limited) and one \nwind subproject (Sipla SPV). LIEs will be appointed to assist with the technical due diligence \nand energy yield assessments of the remaining subprojects as those projects move forward in \ntheir development cycles and prior to disbursement from the facilities. \nImplementation period  The project will be implemented over 1 year\u2014construction will be from January 2017\u2013January \n2018. The project will be administered until final repayment of the solar subprojects in 2038. \n                                                \n9  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n22.  ADB will provide up to $195 million (or Indian rupee equivalent), and administer up to \n$195 million from LEAP as loans to seven SPVs controlled by ReNew. These SPVs were \nestablished to develop solar and wind subprojects in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, \nJharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana. ADB\u2019s loans will have a tenor of up to \n18 years for wind subprojects and 21 years for solar subprojects; administered loans from LEAP \nwill have a tenor of up to 17 years for wind subprojects and 20 years for solar subprojects.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  ADB adds value by mobilizing a substantial financing package to a leading private sector \nrenewable energy developer. ADB's assistance, structured as long-tenor loans to seven SPVs \n(as opposed to a single subproject), will be supplemented by $195 million mobilized through \nLEAP.  This  approach  results  in  a  more  efficient  use  of  ADB's  resources  and  further \ndemonstrates  the  viability  and  bankability  of  the  renewable  energy  sector  in  India.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  also  contributes  towards  meeting the  government\u2019s  target  of renewable  energy \ncapacity addition. \n \n \n \n ", " 6   \nC.  Risks \n \n24.  Offtaker. The sole source of revenue for each subproject is the offtake agreement with \nthe  respective  state-level  distribution  company.  Therefore,  the  long-term  viability  of  each \nsubproject  is  linked  to  the  financial  health  of  the  distribution  company.  However,  all  the \ndistribution  companies  in  this  project  (except  for  Madhya  Gujarat  Vij  Company  Limited  in \nGujarat  state)  have  moderate-to-weak  credit  risk  profiles  and  rely  heavily  on  timely  tariff \nsubsidies from their state governments to remain viable. The risk of delayed payments by such \ndistribution companies is high and there are examples of payment delays to several wind \nenergy projects in certain states. However, no distribution company has defaulted. (Confidential \ninformation redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). However, \nthese  structural  enhancements  will  only  serve  as  short-term  liquidity  measures.  The \ngovernment\u2019s initiatives may improve the financial standing of the distribution companies, but \nthe impact of these measures remains to be seen. \n  \n25.  Sponsor and guarantor risk. ReNew has satisfactorily developed and operated wind \nand  solar  power  projects.  Its  strengths  include  management\u2019s  extensive  experience  in \nrenewable  energy  in  India  and  proven  access  to  debt  and  capital  markets.  (Confidential \ninformation redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n \n26.  Foreign exchange. Subproject revenues are paid in Indian rupees. ADB expects to \narrange separate cross-currency swaps for the tenor phases 1 and 2 of its loans. ReNew will \narrange hedging for the tenor phases 1 and 2 of the LEAP tranche, in line with similar hedging \narrangements previously made for funding in United States (US) dollars provided by other \nbilateral lenders. However, there is no assurance that swap markets can support the envisaged \nhedges at the time the funds are required. This means that alternative Indian rupee funding \nmechanisms (e.g., a rollover of shorter swaps) will need to be included in the loan agreements. \nMoreover, in the event of any early repayment of the loans, any costs related to the unwinding \nof the swap will be passed on to the respective SPV. ADB will also have the option to disburse \nin US dollars, but this will only be undertaken if the foreign currency risk is hedged to ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction. \n \n27.  Engineering, procurement, and construction. (Confidential information redacted under \npara. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). The payments are linked to performance \nmilestones, with strong liquidated damages clauses in case of nonperformance. (Confidential \ninformation redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). ADB will require \nturnkey as well as in-house EPC arrangements to conform to market practices. \n \n28.  Operation and maintenance. (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy). The LIEs will evaluate all related-party arrangements and, before \ndisbursement, verify whether ReNew\u2014and its contractors\u2014can manage the O&M requirements of \nthe subprojects. Before ReNew commits to a subproject, the LIEs will also confirm the adequacy of \ntransmission line arrangements and the ability of the relevant substations to accommodate the \nsubproject to ensure that evacuation risks (during operations) are adequately mitigated. \n \n29.  Solar and wind resources. ADB\u2019s appointed LIEs will carry out energy yield estimates for \neach  site.  For  wind  subprojects,  wind  resource  and  energy  yield  assessments  will  also  be \nconducted by ReNew\u2019s in-house team and third-party industry experts based on at least 2 years \nof uninterrupted wind data. The sites for the solar subprojects are in India\u2019s favorable solar \nradiation  belt.  Resource  forecasts  used  for  calculating  the  base-case  cash  flows  in  each \nsubproject\u2019s financial model will be based on generation exceeding 90% probability each year. A ", "  7 \nresource assessment by an LIE was completed for one wind and two solar subprojects; the rest of \nthe assessments will be completed before signing of the respective loan agreements. \n \n30.   The proposed loans to SPVs owned by ReNew are rated NSO7 for the subprojects \nlocated in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh; NSO9 for the subprojects located in Andhra Pradesh \nand Karnataka; and NSO10 for the subprojects located in Telangana and Jharkhand.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.   In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts. The facilities will support seven subprojects as described in para. 3. The potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project were identified, and effective measures to avoid, \nminimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  ReNew\u2019s \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS). Initial environmental examinations for \nthe two identified solar subprojects were prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements and reviewed by ADB. Initial environmental examinations for the other subprojects \nwill be prepared by ReNew prior to disbursement, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction and in line with its \nESMS provisions.  \n \n32.   The potential environmental and social impacts of solar and wind power subprojects are \ngenerally site-specific, reversible, and mostly caused by associated construction activities. These \nimpacts typically include land and vegetation clearing for site preparation and construction of \naccess  and  internal  roads  within  the  solar  and  wind  farms,  transportation  and  delivery  of \nequipment and materials, excavation and the laying of foundations, and installation of wind \nturbines and solar panels. Issues may potentially include occupational and community health and \nsafety, shadow flicker, noise and vibration, soil erosion, and potential threats to bird and bat \npopulations. All permanent land acquisition for the subproject SPVs will be through voluntary sale \nat market rates on a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis, compliant with requirements for negotiated \nland acquisition laid down in ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements for involuntary resettlement. The \nnegotiated settlements will be confirmed through an external audit of the land procurement \nprocess. Impacts on indigenous peoples are not triggered since the site selection process will \navoid procurement of lands owned, used, occupied, or claimed as ancestral domain by Scheduled \nTribes10 for the project. The ESMS includes screening procedures to assess whether the project \nwill affect the human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples. Subprojects with \npotential impacts on Indigenous Peoples, identified during the screening process, will be excluded \nfrom consideration for ADB financing. \n \n33.
