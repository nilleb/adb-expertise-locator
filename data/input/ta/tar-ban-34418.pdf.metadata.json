The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Southwest  Area \nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Management  Project.  ADB  fielded  a  fact-finding  mission  in \nSeptember 2002. The mission met with representatives of the Government, external funding \nagencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  beneficiaries,  and  agreed  with  the \nGovernment on the TA objective, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2002-2004).1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poverty reduction remains the central development challenge in Bangladesh, which had \na per capita income of approximately $360 in 2000. In 1999, about 50% of the population of \nover 130 million was poor, and 35% extremely poor,2 although the poverty headcount ratios \nwere reduced by about 1% annually in the 1990s. The human development index is also low, \nand Bangladesh ranked 132nd in the world in 1999. The Government has accorded the highest \npriority to poverty reduction in the 5-year plans, and is preparing a comprehensive national \npoverty  reduction  strategy  comprising  (i)  pro-poor  economic  growth  through  stable \nmacroeconomic  management,  improved  governance,  and  development  of  key  economic \nsectors and infrastructure; (ii) human resources and social development through improved \neducation,  health,  nutrition,  social  protection,  and  participatory  processes;  and  (iii)  holistic \nmanagement of natural resources and the environment.  \n \n3.  As about 85% of the poor live in rural areas, the strategy emphasizes agricultural \ndevelopment and other rural activities. However, the country is in the low-lying floodplains of the \nmassive  Ganges-Jamuna-Meghna  river  system,  which  poses  extraordinary  challenges  that \nfundamentally affect the livelihood of the rural poor. These include (i) massive monsoon floods, \n(ii) river erosion and sedimentation of water courses, (iii) severe water shortage in the dry \nseason,  (iv)  periodic  natural  disasters  such as cyclones, and (v) widespread groundwater \narsenic affecting over 30% of the population. In general, high-poverty areas coincide with those \nwith  severe  water  management  problems.  Water  is  also  vital  for  the  vulnerable  natural \necosystems, in particular the wetlands and the Sundarbans mangrove forest that are deemed \namong the richest in the world. Thus, effective water resource management is essential for \nsustainable agricultural and rural development in large parts of the country. \n \n4.  External funding agencies have provided substantial assistance to address these water \nsector  problems.  In  particular,  following  the  devastating  floods  in  1987  and  1988,  major \ncoordinated efforts involving 16 external funding agencies, including ADB, were initiated in 1990 \nunder the Flood Action Plan (FAP). Twenty-six regional and thematic studies were undertaken \nto systematically address the country\u2019s flooding and other water management problems. While \nthe FAP helped establish a substantial knowledge base on complex water management issues, \nFAP processes also revealed limited effectiveness of past interventions due to (i) overemphasis \non a structural approach, (ii) insufficient stakeholder participation and agency coordination, (iii) \nlack of attention to diverse social and environmental water concerns in different livelihood \nactivities, (iv) poor operation and maintenance (O&M), and (v) overall institutional weaknesses. \nThe FAP was also criticized for its initial lack of attention to these issues, causing controversy \nwith  environmental  and  social  lobby  groups  that  campaigned  against  their  preconceived \n                                                 \n1\n  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in September 2002.  \n2\n  Under the cost-of-basic-needs method. \n ", "2  \nstructural bias. Nevertheless, the process eventually led to a consensus on the need to address \nthe country\u2019s water sector problems in an integrated, strategic, and participatory manner while \nsubstantially strengthening the sector institutions. Accordingly, the FAP outcome culminated in a \nstrategy paper in 1995 Bangladesh Flood and Water Management Strategy (BFWMS) \u2014 a 5-\nyear initiative that aimed to (i) improve the sector policy and institutional framework by preparing \nthe National Water Policy (NWP) and National Water Management Plan (NWMP) and reforming \nsector agencies, and (ii) implement a small number of the most critical investments.  \n \n5.  Since its support to a FAP regional study,3 ADB has been associated with the southwest \narea on the south bank of the Ganges-Padma River with a population of 28.6 million. The area \nhas faced increasingly acute water shortages and various associated social and environmental \nproblems  due  to  the  increased  upstream  offtake  from  the  Ganges.  The  problems  were \nexacerbated after the expiration of the Ganges water-sharing treaty with India in 1988, until a \nnew treaty was signed in 1996 that guaranteed sharing at the lowest diversion point in India, \nafter which inflows were slightly restored, although fundamental shortages remain. The area \nalso has a number of coastal and inland embankment systems for tidal surge and flood \nprotection that face serious drainage congestion problems due to the sedimentation of tidal \nchannels and/or system deterioration due to weak O&M. Groundwater arsenic is also the \nseverest in the country. Following the FAP study, ADB gave BWDB a loan to improve drainage \nin the Khulna-Jessore area,4 and an engineering loan to rehabilitate seven large-scale flood \nprotection and irrigation schemes.5 ADB also helped separate executing agencies set up small-\nscale water management structures,6 and conserve the Sundarbans.7  \n \n6.  While  these  interventions  generally  resulted  in  a  conducive  environment  for  sector \nreform and improvement of the productive environment, BWDB\u2019s implementation of the two \nloans was affected by complexities in water sector and institutional weaknesses. Stakeholder \nconsultation  to  finalize  the  design  to  improve  drainage  in  the  Khulna-Jessore area took \nconsiderable time and significantly delayed implementation, although the loan has generated \nsignificant economic benefits. Feasibility studies under the engineering loan were conducted \nwith good stakeholder participation and design concept, but implementation was suspended \npending  demonstrated  progress  in  the  emerging  policy  and  institutional  reforms  deemed \nessential to achieve and sustain the intended benefits.  \n \n7.  In accordance with the BFWMS, the Government has undertaken a range of sector \nreforms since the late 1990s. The NWP, approved in early 1999, adopted the principles of \nintegrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  and  sustainable  service  delivery  through \ndiverse stakeholder participation and decentralization. The National Water Resources Council \nwas  established  as  the  highest  sector  apex  body,  with  the  Water  Resources  Planning \nOrganization (WARPO) as its secretariat. WARPO also prepared a draft NWMP in early 2002, \nwhich provides a broad framework of sector strategy and priorities while expanding the cross-\nsectoral perspective of the FAP with a participatory approach.

A draft water act to comprehensively govern \nthe use and management of water is under preparation.  \n \n8.  These reforms provide the essential basis to comprehensively address the country\u2019s \nwater sector problems through effective IWRM and sustainable service delivery, the stated goal \nof NWP. However, the reforms are still in the formative stage, with a large gap remaining \nbetween the NWP principles and existing operational capacities and arrangements. In terms of \nIWRM, while integrated planning has been accorded priority, the draft NWMP remains as a \nbroad framework plan, based on which more detailed integrated plans need to be prepared at \nsubregional levels for operational purposes, in view of the diverse and complex environmental \nand social concerns, and of the vast opportunities to enhance investment benefits through \ncross-sectoral  integration.  Other  appropriate  IWRM  functions  such  as  coordination  and/or \nregulation of service delivery operations should be defined, along with their suitable institutional \narrangements.  In  terms  of  service  delivery,  NWP  envisages  that  local  governments  and \nstakeholder organizations will play a greater role. To this end, effective work processes and \narrangements to develop the required local institutions need to be clearly established, along \nwith the capacities of the central agencies to support and manage these processes.       \n \n9.  In the context of these ongoing and emerging sector policy and institutional reforms, the \nsouthwest area continues to require priority attention, given its severe water sector challenges \nthat could be worsened by further economic growth in the Ganges river basin. Accordingly, the \nGovernment intends to establish sound water management and sustainable service delivery \ninstitutions and practices in this area on a priority basis, with effective coordination of the \nconcerned external funding agencies.8 In accordance with NWP, specific activities that need to \nbe put into operation include (i) undertaking integrated planning based on the draft NWMP and \noperationalizing other appropriate IWRM functions at the regional and subregional levels, (ii) \nimplementing priority interventions while ensuring optimal and sustainable service delivery with \nstakeholder  participation  and  rationalized  agency  support,  and  (iii)  promoting  necessary \ninstitutional changes and capacity development. The present TA and ensuing loan will develop \nand implement a package of interventions to support these processes, focusing on selected \ndistricts sharing common hydrological subregions in the southwest area. The package could \nserve as a model to implement the NWP at the field level. These actions are in line with ADB\u2019s \nWater Policy and the 2000 poverty partnership agreement between the Government and ADB, \nwhich prioritizes promoting sound water resource management.   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  overall  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  reduce  poverty  by  improving  water  security  and \nenhancing  the  socioeconomic  status  of  people  in  the  southwest  area  by  helping  the \nGovernment implement NWP and the draft NWMP. The immediate TA outputs are (i) integrated \nwater management plans prepared for selected districts with intensive stakeholder consultation \n                                                 \n8  Key activities being assisted include (i) pilot dredging and project preparatory works to restore the Ganges inflow to \nthe Gorai River, funded by the Netherlands and World Bank; (ii) an integrated coastal zone management study by \nthe Netherlands and United Kingdom; (iii) a proposed water sector management project for rehabilitation and \nmanagement transfer of selected medium-scale infrastructure, by the World Bank; and (iv) pilot arsenic mitigation \nin selected districts, by Denmark and Japan. The southwest area has also been selected as a focal area for the \nproposed Rural Water and Poverty Action Program in Bangladesh, which is to be launched at the Third World \nWater Forum in March 2003, and will identify and prepare poverty-focused water sector interventions through \ncollaboration by the interested external funding agencies, including ADB. \n ", "4  \nand  following  the  draft  NWMP,  and  (ii)  an  investment  project  proposal  for  possible  ADB \nfinancing to implement priority interventions identified under the district plans and to strengthen \nrelevant institutions in the regions and selected districts.  \n \n11.  In light of the regional water management issues and corresponding NWMP priorities, \nthe ensuing project will tentatively comprise (i) institutional development for IWRM, including \nintegrated  planning  and  other  appropriate  functions  at  the  regional  and  district  levels;  (ii) \nstrengthening sustainable service delivery, with a focus on optimizing the utilization of existing \nflood protection, drainage, and irrigation systems, to be provided by forming sound water \nmanagement  associations,  rehabilitating  critical  infrastructure,  expanding  agriculture  and \nfisheries,  and  developing  the  capacity  of  the  concerned  organizations;  and  (iii)  any  other \npoverty-focused and participatory priority interventions such as pilot rural arsenic mitigation, \nflood proofing, and other water-related livelihood support. Specific output targets and resource \nrequirements will be examined based on the capacity assessment of the sector institutions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will focus on the selected districts sharing common hydrological subregions in \nthe southwest area.9 The TA will ensure the participation of diverse stakeholders, including \nbeneficiaries and potential affected persons, with the engagement of experienced NGOs, and \nby undertaking intensive participatory rapid rural appraisals and workshops held at various \nlevels. Intensive collaboration with other external funding agencies will be maintained to ensure \ncomplementarity of interventions in the southwest area, as well as to explore the possibilities to \ncofinance the ensuing project.10 The TA has two phases:  \n \n13.  Phase 1 \u2014 Preparing Subregional Integrated Water Management Plans (6 months). \nDuring phase 1, the TA will (i) refine and strengthen the regional strategy and priority actions \nand programs of the draft NWMP, with a focus on rural areas; and (ii) prepare district-level \nintegrated water management plans in light of the refined regional strategy and priorities, and of \nthe stakeholders\u2019 concerns, proposals, and priorities. On the basis of this, possible priority \ninterventions, including institutional actions to be supported under the ensuing project, will be \nidentified through intensive stakeholder consultation and workshops.  \n \n14.  Phase 2 \u2013 Preparing the Southwest IWRM Project (6 months). During phase 2, the \nTA  will  undertake  feasibility  studies  and  prepare  an  investment  project  to  implement  the \nidentified  priority  interventions,  which  will  take  a  bottom-up  and  demand-based  approach \ninvolving stakeholders to resolve local water management problems while sustaining O&M \nthrough local resource mobilization. The investment project will provide comprehensive support \nto maximize the investment benefits while ensuring specific benefits to the poor, and supporting \ncapacity building for IWRM and service delivery institutions. Environmental, social, gender, \nresettlement, and economic assessments will be prepared in accordance with government and \nADB guidelines. The summary initial poverty and social assessment is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.125 million equivalent, comprising $519,000 in foreign \nexchange cost and $606,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $900,000 \n                                                 \n9\n  Including the whole or part of the Faridpur, Jessore, Magura, Narail, and Rajbari districts. These include three flood \nmanagement and drainage rehabilitation projects assessed under the engineering loan in footnote 5. \n10\n In this context, the TA will also coordinate with the preparation process of the Rural Water and Poverty Action \nProgram for Bangladesh, which was mentioned in footnote 8. \n ", "  5\nequivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nto finance the total foreign exchange cost and $381,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe Government agreed to finance the balance of the total cost of $225,000 equivalent, by \nproviding counterpart staff, office facilities and administrative support, local travel and vehicles \nfor  counterpart  staff,  studies,  surveys,  data  analysis,  and  reports.  The  cost  estimate  and \nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2. The Government has been informed that TA approval does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months commencing in April 2003. WARPO and \nBWDB under the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) will be the co-executing agencies. \nWARPO and BWDB will appoint one TA manager each to lead phases 1 and 2, respectively. A \nsteering committee will be established, chaired by the MOWR secretary, and with participation \nby MOWR; Ministry of Land, Planning Commission; and the departments concerned with local \ngovernment  engineering,  public  health  engineering,  agriculture  extension,  cooperatives, \nenvironment, fisheries, forestry, and livestock. A working group headed by TA managers and \ncomprising appointed staff from these organizations will work with the consultants. In each \ndistrict, a coordination committee comprising district representatives of the line agencies and \nactive NGOs will be convened, with the deputy commissioner as chair, the executive engineer \nof the concerned BWDB division as member secretary, and a WARPO representative as an \nadvisor. Stakeholder representatives will also join district committees.  \n \n17.  The TA will be conducted by an international consulting firm in association with a local \nfirm to be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \nconsultants will be selected following the quality- and cost-basis selection procedure with full \ntechnical proposal. The TA requires (i) 18 person-months of international consulting services \ncomprising  specialists  in  water  resource  management  (team  leader),  natural  resource \neconomics, institutions, water supply, environment, and resettlement; and (ii) 47 person-months \nof domestic consulting services comprising a water resource engineer (deputy team leader), \nwater resource planner, participatory development specialist or sociologist , water supply and \nsanitation  specialist,  agricultural  economist,  agronomist,  fishery  specialist,  environmental \nspecialist,  and  resettlement  specialist.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3. \nEquipment will be procured by the consultants following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.    \n \n18.  The  consultants  will  submit  (i)  an  inception  report  within  three  weeks  of  TA \ncommencement, (ii) a draft district integrated water management plans with proposed scope for \nensuing loan project within 5.5 months, (iii) an interim phase 2 report within eight months, (iv) \ndraft final report within ten months, and (v) a final report upon completion of the TA. National-\nlevel workshops will be held at the inception and draft final stages to reflect the views of the \nstakeholders and local and international experts in the TA implementation and outputs. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Bangladesh, not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $900,000  for  preparing  the  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water \nResources Management Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.

Yes  priority in country poverty   Yes \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \nPoverty remains a serious problem, with 50% of the population of over 130 million living under the poverty line in \n2000 (following cost-of-basic-needs method). Since about 85% of the poor live in rural areas and engage in \nagriculture and related non-farm activities, enhancing agricultural and rural development is key to reduce poverty in \nthe country. Access to and control of water is of fundamental importance, as it is the foundation of many rural poor \nlivelihood activities, including agriculture, fisheries, boat transportation, rural industries, and water supply, among \nothers. Given the extraordinary challenges posed by the major river system (massive floods, acute water shortages, \nriver erosion, salinity intrusion, and widespread groundwater arsenic); diverse and conflicting social interests among \ndifferent livelihood activities; and the vulnerable natural environment, it is essential to promote the management of \nwater resources in an integrated, strategic, and participatory manner. Promoting sound water resource management \nhas also been given high priority in the poverty partnership agreement between the Government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).    \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nDuring phase 1 (preparing district-level integrated water management plans), the TA will identify and analyze the \ndiverse stakeholders, status and causes of poverty, priority development concerns, and possible negative impacts of \nthe identified interventions, through participatory rapid rural appraisals (PRRAs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) \nwith the engagement of experienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Interventions with minimum social and \nenvironmental conflicts will be prioritized in the district-level integrated plans. These will include a synthetic poverty \nreduction strategy that will ensure the poverty reduction impacts of the priority interventions, to be designed in the \nnext phase. \n \nDuring phase 2 (preparing an investment project to implement priority interventions while promoting integrated \nmanagement of water resources and sustainable service delivery), detailed poverty and social analysis will be \nundertaken focusing on the most vulnerable groups, including female-headed and/or lowest-income households, and \nmeasures to increase incomes and jobs, empower the vulnerable in decision-making processes of the relevant \ninstitutions, promote gender development, and protect the vulnerable from external shocks. A detailed institutional \nanalysis is needed to develop a framework to manage and coordinate the diverse stakeholder interests while \nprotecting the interests of the most vulnerable.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  \nDuring phase 1, the TA team, including qualified NGOs, will conduct intensive field consultation using PRRA and \nFGD techniques over 4 months to identify and analyze diverse stakeholder concerns and development priorities in all \nthe concerned village unions. The findings will be integrated into the district-level integrated water management plans \nthrough further consultation at subdistrict, district, regional, and national levels.  \n \nDuring phase 2, the concerned stakeholders, including the most vulnerable, will form groups and regularly work with \nthe study team to review the project design and advise the team on it. For some of the identified priority interventions, \ninitial steps will also be taken, following the Government\u2019s guidelines for participatory water management developed \nwith ADB assistance, to form formal stakeholder associations that will drive the demand-driven approach. They will \nmobilize substantial stakeholder support before design, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M), and \nshould take the lead role in these with the government line agencies that will provide services based on the \nperformance of stakeholder participation, including local resource mobilization.    \n \nParticipation strategy required:  \nNot required. However, specific poverty reduction strategy and measures will be developed to ensure that the poor in \nthe identified subproject area will obtain enhanced poverty reduction impacts through targeted interventions such as \nculture fisheries and social forestry, use of public water bodies and lands, arrangements to ensure the poor\u2019s  \nempowerment in project institutions, and other appropriate measures.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7\nD.
