INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will support several developing member countries (DMCs) \nto achieve universal health coverage (UHC).1 It will also inform the preparation of sovereign and \nnonsovereign projects that help achieve the recommendation of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 to scale up health sector investments from the current \n1%\u20132% to 3%\u20135% of total portfolio in the remaining period of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.2 The \nregionwide drive for UHC offers a means to build a long-term health practice and usher in \nassistance beyond health infrastructure. Building knowledge and lines of investment that will \nsupport DMCs achieve UHC provide a practice that will remain relevant as they evolve from \nlow-  to  middle-  to  high-income  countries.  Consultations  with  DMCs  at  the  time  the  new \noperational plan for health was being crafted defined the business lines for the health sector \nwork and the focus of the TA. Subsequent discussions with health officials in Myanmar, the \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam from 13 to 29 July 2015, have confirmed that several DMCs are \ncommitting to achieving UHC and recognizing that investments in health and UHC would help \nreduce  poverty. These DMCs  have  enacted  universal  health  insurance  laws,  crafted  UHC \nstrategies,  increased  investments  in  health  services,  including  investments  in  health \ninfrastructure, and set up and strengthened government health purchasers that purchase health \nservices from both government and private health care providers. Given the regional nature of \nthe TA, the large number of DMCs involved, and the broad health system areas in which it \nexpects to engage (in close consultation with ADB\u2019s operations departments), concurrence from \ngovernments  will  be  secured  before  the  TA  is  implemented.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Access to needed health services. People in DMCs have limited access to needed \nhealth care services with the poorest having the least access (Table 1). Access is further limited \nby the increasing demand for health care services due to: (i) the rapid aging of the population in \nthe region, leading to an increase in noncommunicable diseases; and (ii) the increased health \nrisks associated with rapid urbanization, large mobile populations, climate change and natural \ndisasters, and emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Addressing these issues requires \nan integrated health care service delivery with a skilled health workforce, improved evidence-\nbased diagnostics and treatments, strategic government purchasing of health services, and \nwell-informed health governance. \n \nTable 1: Access to Needed Health Services by Income Quintile,  \nSelected Developing Member Countries \nCountry  Skilled Birth Attendance (%)  Problem Accessing Health Care (%) \n  Poorest  Richest  Poorest  Richest \nBangladesh  6.8  56.5  26.2  16.8 \nCambodia  56.3  97.3  84.3  55.0 \nIndia  21  89.7  67.2  15.4 \nIndonesia  46.5  96.1  61.7  24.5 \nNepal  9.2  64.4  91.1  62.9 \nPakistan  17.8  79.3  Not available  Not available \nSource: World Development Indicators, 2012 (data year vary by country). \n                                                \n1  Ensuring that quality health services are available to all those in need without undue financial hardship. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Despite increasing government \nspending in health,  financial protection\u2014as manifested as the share of out-of-pocket payment \nto total health spending\u2014continues to be persistently low in several DMCs as out-of-pocket \nremains high (Table 2).   \n \nTable 2: Health Spending and Out-of-Pocket Spending in Selected Developing Member \nCountries in Asia and the Pacific \n2013 OOP as \n2013 Health  1999 OOP as % \n% of Total \nCountry  Spending Per  of Total Health \nHealth \nCapita ($)  Expenditure \nExpenditure \nBangladesh  32  57.8  60.2 \nCambodia  76  79.2  59.7 \nIndia  61  64.7  58.2 \nIndonesia  107  47.9  45.8 \nKyrgyz Republic  87  51.5  36.4 \nLao People's Democratic \nRepublic  32  63.4  40.0 \nMongolia  244  9.9  37.0 \nMyanmar  14  89.0  68.2 \nNepal  39  64.6  46.2 \nPakistan  37  66.5  54.9 \nPhilippines  122  43.3  56.7 \nSri Lanka  102  44.5  46.5 \nUzbekistan  120  49.2  46.1 \nViet Nam  111  61.9  49.4 \nOOP = out of pocket. \nSources: World Bank and World Health Organization. \n \n4.  Health  system  governance.  The  health  market  is  imperfect  and  government \nstewardship  remains  crucial  if  universal  health  coverage  is  to  be  achieved.  Strengthened \nplanning, financial management, institutions, health information, and health regulatory systems \nbacked by information and communication technology solutions are needed to ensure quality, \nefficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability. Stronger governance will require \ninvesting in accreditation of hospitals, licensing of health workers and facilities, implementing \nregulatory  processes  for  pharmaceuticals  and  medical  goods,  and  improving  legal  and \nregulatory environment for private sector engagement and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). \n \n5.   Poor health remains an obstacle to full participation in economic growth for populations \nthroughout Asia and the Pacific. DMCs are, therefore, pursuing UHC as a way to improve health. \nThe TA will support the UHC commitment of DMCs by informing country decisions on necessary \ninvestments  in  health  infrastructure,  health  financing,  and  health  governance.  ADB  has \naccumulated  valuable  experience  in  supporting  investments  in  health  systems,  such  as \ninvesting in health infrastructure (i.e., hospitals, primary health care clinics, medical training \ninstitutes, and laboratories), strengthening health governance, and financing health services. \nSupporting UHC commitments provides an opportunity to move away from fragmented small \nhealth projects to broader health system approaches where service delivery, financing, and \ngovernance issues can be addressed at the same time. It will elevate sector dialogue to address \n ", "  3\nbroader  country  aspirations,  and  open  opportunities  for  substantial  ADB  health  operations \naligned  with  country  needs.  There  is  no  TA  project  similar  to  this,  which  supports  the \nimplementation of an Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be the achievement of UHC, including financial risk protection, access to \nquality essential health care services and to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential \nmedicines and vaccines for all.4 The outcome will be an increase in the number of DMCs \nimplementing UHC strategies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Three  main  outputs  will  help  achieve  the  TA\u2019s  expected  outcome:  (i)  undertaking \nanalysis of knowledge gaps and key challenges in developing health systems to achieve and \nsustain UHC; (ii) disseminating knowledge on designing, implementing, and scaling up UHC \ninterventions; and (iii) identifying investment opportunities for projects supporting UHC. \n \n8.  Output 1 includes assessments and development of working papers on national health \ninsurance (NHI), PPPs in health, and urban health. Pertinent country briefs of DMCs identified in \nconsultation with the operational departments will be part of these papers.   Specifically,  \n(i)  a regional paper on NHI in Asia and the Pacific, which may include country briefs \non the NHI systems of India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and \nViet  Nam.  The  briefs  shall  include  how  the  NHI  or  government  purchaser \nengages the private health sector;  \n(ii)  a review of integrated hospital systems in Asia, which may include country briefs \non  the  hospital  systems  of  Fiji,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic, \nKazakhstan,  Mongolia,  Myanmar,  Pakistan,  Papua  New  Guinea,  and  the \nPhilippines;  \n(iii)  a working paper on health PPPs in DMCs in Asia and the Pacific, and reviews of \nthe  private  health  sector  in  selected  DMCs  which  may  include  Fiji,  India, \nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines; and  \n(iv)  a review of urban health systems in Asia and the Pacific, which may include a \ncountry brief on urban health in Bangladesh. \n \n9.  Output 2 activities involve  \n(i)  organizing regional meetings and training events; and \n(ii)  supporting regional networks, including regional meetings on urban health, health \nPPPs, and NHI; and training workshops on health financing and health PPPs. \n \n10.  Output 3 involves identifying investment opportunities, conducting policy dialogues on \nincreased investment in UHC, supporting the preparation of health sector assessment, strategy, \nand road map, and developing concept notes for projects supporting UHC. \n \n                                                \n4  2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Universal Health Coverage (Sustainable Development \nGoal 3.8). \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($500,000 from TASF-V and $1,000,000 by TASF-\nOther Sources). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  A parallel financing (not administered by ADB) from the Republic of Korea Knowledge \nSharing Program in the amount of $250,000 will support output 1, specifically by funding the \nassessment of NHI systems of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.   The TA will be implemented from October 2015 to December 2020. Five consultants \n(three international, two national) with expertise in NHI, hospital management, PPP in health, \nand  urban  health,  will  be  recruited  to  help  implement  and  deliver  the  TA\u2019s  outputs  for  a \ncombined total engagement of 42 person-months. In the interest of efficiency and timeliness, \nindividual consultants instead of firms will be engaged.  \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. Consultants will be recruited by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The Health Sector Group \nSecretariat will implement the TA in coordination with ADB\u2019s operations departments for each \ncountry to ensure that the TA outputs are fully aligned with current and planned health initiatives. \nThis would include quarterly briefings and updates of the TA activities and outputs to ADB\u2019s \noperations departments. All disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  The TA will involve several knowledge events, and produce several knowledge products. \nThese will be around NHI, urban health, PPP in health, and UHC (Appendix 1). Information on \nthese events, copies of the knowledge products, as well as progress reports on the various \naspects of the TA will be uploaded in the health sector page of ADB\u2019s website, and in the \nwebsite of partner agencies as appropriate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Universal  Health  Coverage  for  Inclusive  Growth:  Supporting  the  Implementation  of  the \nOperational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \nUHC,a including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and to safe, \neffective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all ( Sustainable Development Goal \n3.8)b,  is achieved. \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Risks \nwith Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nOutcome       \n   \nDMCs implementing  By 2020, 35 DMCs are  Annual World Health  Inadequate political \nUHC strategies  implementing national  Organization reports  support to pursue UHC \nincreased  health insurance programs \nas part of their UHC \nstrategies  \n(Baseline: 24 out of 44 \nDMCs have some form of \nnational health insurance)  \n \nOutputs       \n1.
