Investment Program Summary\n The proposed $505 million sovereign-guaranteed Solar Rooftop Investment Program (SRIP) is a multitranche financing facility, \nconsisting of $500 million financial intermediation loans and a $5 million capacity development technical assistance. As \nrequested by the Government of India, Punjab National Bank would be the borrower, and the India would provide a sovereign \nguarantee to the Asian Development Bank for the SRIP. The SRIP intends to primarily finance large solar rooftop systems on \nindustrial and commercial buildings on standalone or aggregated basis. Punjab National Bank's loans to subborrowers will be \npriced based on Punjab National Bank's cost of funds and subproject-specific risks. The proposed accompanying technical \nassistance for $5 million is critical to integrate the building blocks of the Government of India's sector development initiative to \nensure a viable market demand, by strengthening (i) Punjab National Bank's institutional capacity, and (ii) certain market \ndevelopment elements. SRIP's value addition, inclusive of $330 million from ordinary capital resources and $170 million from \nClean Technology Fund, is to facilitate India's transition to a low carbon economy and therefore contribute to the climate change\ngoal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 441,700 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, or about 11 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent over the typical 25-year lifetime of rooftop solar systems.\nImpact: Energy security provided to all in an environmentally sustainable manner, and renewable energy developed \nOutcome: Solar rooftop capacity in India increased. \nOutputs: (i)Debt funding to the solar rooftop sector increased, (ii)PNB institutional capacity improved,  and (iii)Solar rooftop \nmarket infrastructure and bankable subproject pipeline developed\nImplementation Arrangements: Punjab National Bank will be the executing agency.\n \nProject Readiness: The proposed technical assistance, funded by Clean Technology Fund, would be provided to the \nGovernment of India to develop the strategic building blocks of the multitranche financing facility. Ministry of New and \nRenewable Energy and Punjab National Bank would be the executing agencies for the technical assistance. The proposed \ntechnical assistance would have three main components: (i) Punjab National Bank's institutional capacity development, (ii) \nmarket development, and (iii) awareness campaign, all of which focus on the necessary conditions to develop a viable \nsubproject pipeline and catalyze market demand for funds. Concurrently, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is preparing \nan initial list of solar rooftop subprojects to be funded by Punjab National Bank, which is also developing subprojects from its \nexisting industrial and commercial borrowers. \n12.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Punjab National Bank (PNB), to be guaranteed by India, \nfor the Solar Rooftop Investment Program (SRIP). The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of the technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund \n(CTF)  for  institutional  capacity  and  market  development,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1  \n \n2.  The proposed SRIP would (i) establish a solar rooftop financing facility at PNB to provide \ndedicated debt financing to help the country meet its 40 gigawatts (GW) solar rooftop capacity \ntarget  by  2022;  and  (ii)  provide  associated  institutional  capacity  and  market  development \nsupport, leading to a pipeline of bankable subprojects. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Road map. The Government of India (government) plans to expand the country\u2019s solar \nrooftop capacity by 40 GW by 2022. To fuel India\u2019s economic growth, its power system will have \nto expand rapidly over the next decade. This is also to maintain national energy security and \nexpand  energy  access  to  all  people  in  India.2 To  ensure  environmental  sustainability,  the \ngovernment places a high priority on renewable energy development. India\u2019s National Action \nPlan on Climate Change (prepared in 2008) outlines existing and future policies and programs \naddressing climate mitigation and adaptation. Under the plan, the government launched the \nJawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) in 2010 to add 20 GW of grid connected \nsolar energy by 2022. On 17 July 2015, the Union Cabinet approved a revised JNNSM proposal \nto increase the original 20 GW solar energy target to 100 GW by 2022, including 40 GW of \nrooftop solar energy generation.3 This government target and the ongoing government sector \ndevelopment initiative establish the road map that is required by the MFF.  \n \n4.  Solar rooftop market development. The basic elements to support development of the \nsolar rooftop market are in place, as reflected by the unbundling of state electricity boards and \nthe presence of open access and competition among transmission and distribution companies. \nHowever, the solar rooftop market is at an early stage of development, and there is low market \nawareness of the latest solar photovoltaic technology and its financial benefits. Local power \ndistribution companies have yet to achieve profitability, due to persistently low electricity tariffs, \nto become offtakers (purchasers) of rooftop solar power. Commercial banks perceive solar \nrooftop projects as having a high credit risk due to the sector\u2019s limited track record. Banks\u2019 \ncapacity to evaluate, price, and monitor solar rooftop projects is also limited. There are primarily \ntwo  types  of  solar  rooftop  models:  (i)  the  standalone,  and  (ii)  aggregated  (from  multiple \n                                                \n1  \u201cRooftop\u201d generally refers to the roofs of immovable building structures. In the case of the roofs of other types of \nstructure, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) would evaluate them on a case-by-case basis by ensuring their \ncompliance with the selection criteria outlined in the facility administration manual and legal agreements to be \neligible for ADB financing.  \n2  India\u2019s current primary energy mix is coal (44%), biomass (24%), oil (23%), natural gas (6%), other renewables \n(2%), and nuclear (1%).

The two prevailing business models for large \nindustrial or commercial properties are (i) capex, and (ii) opex.4  \n \n5.  Commercial viability. Despite the challenges, solar rooftop projects are increasingly \nachieving  commercial  (technical  and  financial)  viability  and/or  grid  parity.  The  photovoltaic \ntechnologies are maturing and the cost of manufacturing photovoltaic panels has declined \ndrastically over the past 40 years. In industrial and commercial sectors in India, the levelized \ncost of electricity has steadily declined, and is now about Rs7\u20139 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). In \nsome cases (e.g., solar parks), it can even fall below Rs5 per kWh, compared to utility tariffs \nbetween  Rs6\u201312  per  kWh.  The  levelized  cost  of  electricity  from  solar  rooftop  systems  is \nexpected to continue declining, and reach grid parity in an increasing number of states. A feed-\nin-tariff is also available in some states (e.g., Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, \nwith a range from about Rs5\u2013Rs7 per unit). In the institutional (e.g., government, schools, and \nhospitals) and residential sectors, where the grid parity may not be achieved immediately, the \ngovernment provides capital subsidy of 30% of system costs to ensure project commercial \nviability.5 Currently, successful solar rooftop projects also rely on the strong balance sheets of \nprofitable  industrial  and  commercial  clients  for  their  captive  use,  without  relying  on  power \ndistribution companies to purchase the electricity.  \n \n6.  Demand analysis. The solar rooftop market potential in India is substantial, with an \nestimated total capacity potential of 124 GW.6 The present installed solar rooftop capacity in \nIndia is only 221 megawatts (MW), or 0.2% of the potential.7 Based on a $40\u2013$50 billion cost \nestimate to develop the 40 GW solar rooftop capacity,8 the proposed $1 billion SRIP would only \ncontribute 2.0\u20132.5% of the total solar rooftop target potential. Given strong government support, \nthe solar rooftop market in India is expected to grow rapidly. Based on the existing government \nmandate  to  install  solar  rooftop  systems  on  government  buildings  and  other  public  sector \nproperties, it is estimated that the rooftop solar system installation potential on public sector \nbuildings alone was 7.2 GW.9 In addition, the Solar Energy Corporation of India has successfully \ntendered 500 MW of solar rooftop energy in early 2016, illustrating positive developments in \nmarket demand. In terms of other market conditions, solar and net-metering policies have been \nissued  and  enacted  in  numerous  states  and  the  government  has  set  renewable  energy \npurchase obligations targets.10 In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of India identified renewable \nenergy as a priority lending sector to facilitate bank lending to solar rooftop projects.11  \n \n                                                \n4  Under the capex model, the solar rooftop system is owned by the property owner; under the opex model, the \nsystem is owned by the developer.

As requested by the government, PNB would be the \nborrower12 and India would provide a sovereign guarantee to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for the SRIP. The SRIP intends to primarily finance large solar rooftop systems on \nindustrial  and  commercial  buildings  on  standalone  or  aggregated  basis.13 PNB\u2019s  loans  to \nsubborrowers will be priced based on PNB\u2019s cost of funds and subproject-specific risks. The \nproposed accompanying TA for $5 million is critical to integrate the building blocks of the \ngovernment\u2019s sector development initiative to promote market demand, by strengthening (i) \nPNB\u2019s institutional capacity, and (ii) market infrastructure. SRIP\u2019s value addition is to facilitate \nIndia\u2019s transition to a low carbon economy and therefore contribute to the climate change goal \nof reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 441,700 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, \nor about 11 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the typical 25-year lifetime of rooftop \nsolar systems. \n \n8.  The proposed financial intermediary. PNB has total assets of Rs6.3 trillion ($95.6 \nbillion),  making  it  India\u2019s fifth-largest  bank  in  terms  of total  assets.  PNB  is  a  systemically \nimportant financial institution. It was established in 1895 and nationalized in 1969. As of 31 \nMarch 2016, the government held a direct 62.1% stake in the bank. PNB has a nationwide \nnetwork of 6,760 branches and is able to finance solar rooftop subprojects throughout India. In \n2016, major credit rating agencies in India gave PNB an investment grade rating on par with the \nsovereign. PNB has a strong energy sector team. However, it would require support to develop \nits  specific  solar  rooftop  credit  risk  assessment  skills  to  facilitate  subloan  selection,  credit \nreview, pricing, and approval.  \n \n9.  Multitranche financing facility. The government requested large financing packages \nfrom ADB, New Development Bank, and the World Bank14 to catalyze greater commercial \nfinance and support solar rooftop sector development. However, the solar rooftop market is still \nevolving and would require a series of support measures from 2016\u20132022 to achieve the stated \n40 GW target. A financial intermediation MFF represents a commitment to the government on \nan appropriate funding and TA support, while ensuring flexibility to accommodate the varying \nfunding needs for (i) more generally, the solar rooftop sector development process (e.g., from \ninitial early market development stage to subsequent rapid deployment stage); and (ii) more \nspecifically,  the  support  to  PNB\u2019s  dedicated  onlending  requirements.  There  will  be  no \ndifferences in the nature of solar rooftop projects financed across tranches. Compared to a \nstandalone project, an MFF is a more suitable funding modality to support integrated market \ndevelopment  in  the  solar  rooftop  sector  in  India.  The  benefits  of  an  MFF  modality  are \ndemonstrated  by  ADB\u2019s  successful  implementation  of  a  number  of  recent  MFF  financial \nintermediation loans in India including in the renewable energy space.15  \n \n10.  Strategic context. The SRIP contributes significantly to the ADB objective of doubling \nannual climate financing from the current level of $3 billion to $6 billion by 2020, of which $4 \nbillion would be dedicated to mitigation, including through increased support for renewable \n                                                \n12 Punjab National Bank was selected by the Ministry of Finance to be the sole direct participating financial institution \nunder the proposed investment program (para. 13). \n13 SRIP may consider supporting smaller residential solar rooftop financing when that market further matures. \n14 The World Bank\u2019s Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar Program of $625 million was approved on 13 May 2016.  \n15 This includes: (i) India Infrastructure Finance Company: ADB. 2013.

The  entire  $500  million  MFF  is  considered  as  climate  financing.  The  investment \nprogram is consistent with the ADB Energy Policy (2009) by (i) promoting energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy; (ii) maximizing access to energy for all; and (iii) promoting energy sector \nreform, capacity building, and governance.16 The investment program is also consistent with (i) \nthe ADB Financial Sector Operational Plan, which recognizes financial intermediation as an \nimportant  instrument  for  on-lending  including  for  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, which includes an energy sector road map to expand \nclean  and  renewable  energy  capacity  and  financial  sector  development  to  catalyze \ninfrastructure investments, including through credit lines.17 Finally, the SRIP supports India\u2019s \nIntended Nationally Determined Contribution, which includes targets to lower the emissions \nintensity of India\u2019s gross domestic product by 33% below 2005 levels (to 35% by 2030), and to \nincrease the share of nonfossil-based power generation capacity to 40% of installed electric \npower capacity by 2030. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n11.  The  impacts  of  the  program  would  be  energy  security  provided  to  all  in  an \nenvironmentally  sustainable  manner  and  renewable  energy  developed,  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Integrated  Energy  Policy.18 The  outcome  would  be  increased  solar  rooftop \ncapacity in India. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The MFF and tranche 1 outputs would be (i) debt funding to the solar rooftop sector \nincreased, (ii) PNB institutional capacity improved, and (iii) solar rooftop market infrastructure \nand bankable subproject pipeline developed.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The government program has a target of 40 GW of solar rooftop capacity with estimated \ncosts of $40 billion (Table 1). ADB\u2019s investment program will contribute $1 billion (Table 2) \ncomprised of $330 million loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR), $170 million loans from \nCTF,19 equity of $300 million from developers, and commercial debt financing of $200 million. \nPNB has requested ADB financing through this MFF consisting of three tranches (tranche 1 \nloan of $100 million from 2016\u20132018, tranche 2 loan of $150 million from 2018\u20132020, and \ntranche 3 loan of $250 million from 2020\u20132022), subject to PNB\u2019s submission of related periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan agreement and guarantee agreement with \nIndia for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the \nframework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF will be a loan in the amount of \n$100 million to be financed entirely by CTF and administered by ADB. The CTF loan has a \nmaturity of 40 years with a 10-year grace period. Principal repayments would be 2% for years \n11\u201320 and 4% for years 21\u201340. CTF\u2019s multilateral development bank fee is 0.18% and annual \nservice charge is 0.25%.  \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n17 ADB. 2013.

PNB would establish a designated solar rooftop \nunit during implementation, associated counterpart resources, and dedicated internal capacity to \nimplement  the  SRIP.  The  facility  administration  manual  (FAM)  would  provide  the  detailed \nimplementation arrangements and compliance requirements.21 \n   \n15.  Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing would be allowed for eligible expenditures \ndescribed  in  the  FAM,  not  exceeding  20%  under  each  tranche,  incurred  before  loan \neffectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. Any \nretroactive financing would comply with the same ADB requirements as applied to any other \nsubprojects funded under the SRIP.  \n \n16.  Takeout financing. PNB may also use up to 20% of the ADB funds to buy out qualified \nsolar  rooftop  loans  from  other  financial  institutions  under  each  tranche  in  order  to  better \nconsolidate sector assets. Takeout finance may include subprojects that are financially closed \nor under construction. Any takeout financing would follow prevailing national norms, and comply \nwith the same ADB requirements as applied to any other subprojects funded under the SRIP. \n                                                \n21 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n17.  Maximum ADB financing. ADB funds can be used to finance up to 50% of the total \nsubproject cost. There is no maximum subproject size. \n \n18.  Procurement from nonmember countries of ADB. Although the MFF will be jointly \nfinanced by ADB and CTF, the individual tranche under the MFF may be financed solely by \neither CTF or ADB. In view of the multisource financing, a waiver22 of ADB\u2019s member country \nprocurement  eligibility  for  the  loans  is  sought  to  allow  for  procurement  from  nonmember \ncountries of ADB23 under the MFF. \n \n19.  Statement of expenditure and/or free limit. Under tranche 1, ADB would review at \nleast the first three subprojects approved by PNB under both the imprest and reimbursement \narrangements, regardless of the subproject size, until ADB is satisfied with PNB\u2019s ability to \nmanage the subproject review and disbursement process. Following ADB\u2019s satisfactory review \nof  a  representative  sample  of  subprojects,  ADB  may  permit  a  $1  million  statement  of \nexpenditure limit per subloan, under which amount no supporting documentation would be \nrequired, except basic subproject information for the purpose of ADB disbursement (footnote \n20). For any subloan exceeding $1 million, ADB approval would be required. ADB reserves the \nright to request any supporting subproject documents and to not reimburse or liquidate any \nsubprojects that do not comply with the SRIP implementation requirements. \n \n20.  Eligibility  criteria.  ADB  funds  shall  be  used  to  finance  all  types  of  solar  rooftop \nsubprojects that are financially sound and comply with the subproject eligibility criteria set forth \nin the framework financing agreement and approval procedures as outlined in the FAM.  \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe FAM. \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2016\u2013December 2022 (MFF); December 2016\u2013December 2018 \n(Tranche 1); December 2018\u2013December 2020 (Tranche 2); and December \n2020\u2013December 2022 (Tranche 3) \nLoan closing date  30 June 2023 (MFF); 30 June 2019 (Tranche 1); 30 June 2021 (Tranche 2); \nand 30 June 2023 (Tranche 3)  \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Board of Directors, PNB \n(ii)   Executing agency  PNB \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  PNB \n(iv)  Implementation unit  New Delhi, number of staff deemed appropriate to PNB and ADB \nProcurement  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) as applicable to financial intermediation loans \nConsulting services  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time) \nRetroactive financing  Permitted up to 20% of each tranche and total SRIP amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds would be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between PNB and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PNB = Punjab National Bank, SRIP = Solar Rooftop Investment Program.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n                                                \n22 This would permit procurement of goods, works, and consultant services from nonmember countries of ADB. The \nBoard of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting power \nof the members of the Board. \n23 On 18 March 2013, the Board approved a blanket waiver of member country procurement eligibility restrictions in \ncertain cases of cofinanced ADF operations. \n ", "7 \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n22.  A proposed $5 million TA grant, funded by CTF,24 would be provided to the government \nto develop the strategic building blocks of the MFF, from 2017\u20132022. MNRE and PNB would be \nthe executing agencies for the TA. The proposed TA would have three main components: (i) \nPNB institutional capacity development, (ii) market development, and (iii) awareness campaign, \nall of which focus on the necessary conditions to develop a viable subproject pipeline and \ncatalyze market demand for funds. While ADB will administer the proposed TA, the training \ncomponent will be delegated to and implemented by MNRE and PNB. The amount for the \ndelegated TA component is estimated at $2.5 million. MNRE, PNB, and/or associated (MNRE) \npartner  training  institutions  and  (PNB)  regional  training  centers  would  have  the  fiduciary \nresponsibility for implementing the training programs in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and ADB Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time), and those pertaining to financial management and \nmonitoring and review. Institutional capacity assessments have been conducted on MNRE, \nPNB, and selected training institutions and regional training centers, and are satisfactory.25 With \nthe engagement of an ADB procurement consultant to support the TA implementation, MNRE \nand  PNB  would  have  the  required  capacities  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  delegated  TA \ncomponent with the ADB procurement guidelines. An agreement will be signed between ADB \nand MNRE and PNB respectively on the arrangements of this delegated training component.26 \nADB will regularly monitor and review the delegated TA components.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n23.   ADB\u2019s due diligence consists of detailed institutional, financial, economic, technical, \nmarket, and related capacity assessments to ensure PNB\u2019s ability to successfully implement \nSRIP and comply with the associated requirements. ADB conducted comprehensive institutional \ncapacity reviews on PNB, including credit procedures, risk management, technical capacities, \nand  compliances,  among  others.  ADB  has  also  conducted  integrity  due  diligence.  Project \nsafeguards  due  diligence  included  site  visits,  and  interactions  with  the  project  promoters, \nproperty owners, and the communities to ensure minimal safeguard risk. It is determined that \nPNB\u2019s internal approval procedures are sufficient to minimize potential implementation risks to \nensure subproject compliance with ADB requirements. PNB has a strong project finance team \nand an extensive branch network to reach out to developers and solar rooftop owners.  \n \nA.  Technical \n24.  The technical viability of solar rooftop systems has been well established throughout the \nworld over the past 20 years. However, there are still technical issues in India. For example, \nbecause of constant load shedding, inverters must be capable of disconnecting from the grid in \ncase of grid failure, while still being able to operate and provide solar energy for captive use. \nThe overall technical risk is inherent to the state of market development in India. In addition, \nADB assessed PNB\u2019s ability to appraise the technical viability of renewable energy subprojects \nand  found  its  technical  assessment  process  to  be  adequate.  PNB  has  limited  subproject \n                                                \n24 For the CTF grant of $5 million, there is a multilateral development bank fee of 5% or $250,000. Clean Technology \nFund Implementation Guidelines (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25 The institutional capacity assessments will continue into the TA implementation phase for any remaining PNB \ntraining centers and MNRE partner institutions whose capacities have not been assessed, when engaged for the \nfirst time.  \n26 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nfinancing experience, and its solar rooftop technical and financial review capacity will need to be \nstrengthened, as proposed under the TA.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The viability of PNB as a financial intermediary for the proposed solar rooftop business \nmodel is an indicator of the viability of the overall project. According to ADB guidelines,27 the \nmost  important  criteria  for  determining  the  appropriateness  of  a  financial  intermediary\u2019s \nperformance are capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, liquidity, and \nsensitivity to market risk. In summary, the financial indicators are generally satisfactory during \nFY2010\u2013FY2015, despite a decline in profitability and rise in nonperforming assets from 2015 to \n2016, as manifested in the entire Indian banking sector during the same period as a result of the \nreform measures. Economic and financial internal rates of return on a set of sample subprojects \nare provided for illustrative purposes under both capex and opex models. Economic benefits are \nnon-incremental. Non-incremental benefits include avoided costs and environmental benefits \nfrom rooftop solar systems\u2019 replacement of backup diesel generators and conventional grid \npower.  Additional  non-incremental  benefits  are  savings  from  power  distribution  companies\u2019 \ntechnical losses. 28 \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  Financial management. PNB has the financial management capability to administer the \nMFF.  PNB\u2019s  board  of  directors  oversees  all  operations.  PNB  has  adequate  capacity  for \nbudgeting,  accounting,  finance,  assets  and  liabilities  management,  internal  controls,  and \nreporting functions. PNB is subject to the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s prudential regulations for \ncommercial banks in India, and its capital adequacy ratio of 12.2% as of FY2015 is above the \nregulatory requirement of 12.0%. The financial management control risk is moderate. \n \n27.  Procurement and disbursement. All procurement to be financed under the MFF would \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time), following stated eligibility criteria. ADB encourages PNB to require its subborrowers to \nadopt internationally competitive bidding procedures to the extent possible when the amount of \nthe investment is unusually large and economy and efficiency can be gained through such \nprocedures. For procurement of goods and services to be financed by subloans from the ADB \nloan, PNB would ensure that prices are reasonable and that relevant factors\u2014e.g., time of \ndelivery, efficiency, reliability, suitability for the subproject, and (for consulting services) quality \nand competence\u2014are taken into account. Solar panels procured under the India domestic \ncontent requirement would not be eligible for financing under the SRIP. ADB loan proceeds \nwould  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as \namended from time to time). ADB may provide PNB with United States dollars as the currency \nof payment.  \n \n28.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and PNB. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 20). \n \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila (Section 6.4. Assessing FI Performance). \nhttp://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/31339/financial-governance-management.pdf \n28 The financial analyses are in Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The benefits of rooftop solar energy capacity additions include localized  improvement of \nlivelihoods and job creation at the subproject sites. The design of the SRIP incorporates some \ngender elements. ADB would also encourage PNB and the subproject developers to promote \ngender inclusiveness by (i) increasing the recruitment of women in the construction, operation, \nand maintenance of systems; and (ii) applying a gender-equal human resources management \nthrough the effective application of gender equity laws and regulations. There will be regular \nreporting regarding the implementation and progress of these measures. The poverty reduction \nimpact of renewable energy projects can be both direct and indirect. The direct impact is \nthrough  additional  power  generation  which  supports  economic  activities  and  improves  the \nlivelihoods of individuals, such as through the provision of lighting, refrigeration, and other \nhousehold  amenities.  The  investment  also  creates  economic  benefits  for  other  business \nsectors,  service  providers,  and  related  industries.  Indirectly,  rooftop  solar  energy  projects \nminimize the negative environmental impacts associated with conventional power generation \nand improve general public health conditions.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The safeguard  categories for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples are all \u201cFI\u201d treated as \u201cC.\u201d The solar rooftop systems do not require land, and have no \nimpact on involuntary resettlement and indigenous people. The nature of the solar rooftop \nsystems will improve the environmental conditions in India and mitigate negative impact of \nglobal  climate  change.  The  environmental  and  social  impacts  associated  with  the \nimplementation  of  solar  rooftop  projects,  either  commercial-scale  or  residential-scale,  is \nnegligible. Therefore, an environment and social safeguard management system is not required, \nand an environmental assessment review framework will not be prepared. ADB will monitor \nprogram implementation to ensure that subprojects financed by the facility do not have negative \nenvironmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts; and that corrective \nactions are taken if unforeseen issues arise.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The  key  project  risk  is  the  largely  supply-driven  (e.g.,  funding)  nature  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s solar rooftop program in a market that has yet to realize its full commercial \npotential. In line with the incipient nature of the new lending business line, the proposed MFF \nwould help develop building blocks under the first tranche and associated TA, with important \nsector supports to be followed by subsequent tranche(s) that focus on supplying funding. The \nmajor risk and its mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The integrated program risks \nare expected to outweigh the integrated program costs. Other risks are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.29  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nUntested  (i) Central and/or state level mandates to install solar rooftop systems in new and existing \nsolar  public  sector  buildings;  (ii)  government\u2019s  market  development  measures  (e.g.,  net \nrooftop  metering); (iii) government\u2019s financial commitment (e.g., 30% subsidy to certain sectors); \nmarket  (iv) MNRE and/or SECI present tender of large pipeline projects; (v) active donor support \n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \ndemand  (e.g., ADB, German development cooperation through KfW, the World Bank); (vi) positive \nfeedback from the market and project developers; and (vii) ADB TA to enhance capacity. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MNRE = Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, PNB = Punjab National Bank, \nSECI = Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n32.  The government and PNB have assured ADB that the implementation of the SRIP shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and PNB have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \nset  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  Specific  covenants  agreed  to  by  the \ngovernment and PNB with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan \nagreement for the respective tranches. \n \n34.  Prior  to  tranche  1  disbursement,  the  following  conditions  would  be  met:  (i)  PNB \nestablishes a specific solar rooftop unit at its head office and in a select number of its branches \nwith  appropriate  staff  capacity  for  solar  rooftop  project  origination,  development,  financial \nreview,  approval,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  PNB  establishes  a  robust  credit  risk  rating  model \nsatisfactory to ADB; (iii) the government provides mandate to certain government entities and \npublic institutions to install solar rooftop systems on their rooftop properties to ensure an initial \npipeline of subprojects; and (iv) MNRE provides PNB with an initial list of bankable subprojects \nfrom its channel partners.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i)  the multitranche financing facility to Punjab National Bank, to be guaranteed by \nIndia,  for  the  Solar  Rooftop  Investment  Program  in  an  aggregate  principal \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000,000, which comprises:  \n(a)  the provision of loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest \nand  other  terms to  be determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and \n(b)  the  administration  of  loan  cofinancing  to  be  provided  by  the  Clean \nTechnology Fund; \nand  is  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented \nto the Board; and \n(ii)  the proposal in para. 18 of this report to permit procurement in nonmember \ncountries  of  ADB  of  goods,  works,  and  consultant  services  produced  in \nnonmember countries of ADB. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n9 September 2016\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \n \nEnergy security provided to all in an environmentally sustainable manner, and renewable energy \ndeveloped (Integrated Energy Policy)a \n \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2023     \nSolar rooftop  a. 400 MW of solar rooftop power- a\u2013c.
