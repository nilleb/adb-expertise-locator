INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Government of \nMongolia in improving prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and control of viral hepatitis.   \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for Mongolia, 2017\u20132019 and is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020 which emphasizes social development through efficient delivery of health \nservices under its health and social protection focus.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia has one of the highest rates in the world for viral hepatitis incidence and \nprevalence. Viral hepatitis B and C have a high prevalence in the adult population of Mongolia \nbecause of weak infection prevention, screening, and control. Hepatitis B and C virus infections \nare closely associated with liver cancer and cirrhosis. Most cases of hepatitis B virus are \ntransmitted from mother to child and acquired in early childhood, and it is likely that some chronic \nhepatitis B virus infections have resulted from transmission associated with health care. The major \nmodality of hepatitis C virus transmission in Mongolia is through parenteral exposure within the \nformal and informal health sector. Hepatitis D virus infection is highly endemic among the \npopulation with chronic hepatitis B viral infection.2 Hepatitis B vaccination is now available for \nchildren and vaccination coverage is high, however infection among adults still needs to be better \ncontrolled. Infection control in health care facilities is poor and hospital-acquired infections are \nthought to be underreported. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C among health workers is one \nof the highest in the world, and points to breaches in health safety protocol and control of \ninfectious diseases.3 Sterilization facilities and practices in hospitals are poor, and basic hygiene \npractices  like  hand  washing  are  not  always  observed.  The  surveillance  system  currently \nimplemented in hospitals consists of passive reporting of hospital-acquired infections. Lack of \nknowledge and awareness among health workers about infections, transmission, and cause of \nviral hepatitis exacerbates the situation. Insufficient state budget funding of infection control and \nprevention in the hospitals remains a challenge.  \n \n4.  Measures to improve the viral hepatitis epidemiological status include improving infection \nprevention and control in hospitals, and ensuring blood products are safe and health workers are \nprotected. To improve hepatitis control, a comprehensive active surveillance system needs to be \nestablished. This will require capacity development of staff based on establishing standard \noperating procedures, sentinel surveillance nodes, and a national viral hepatitis surveillance and \ninformation system. The comprehensive active surveillance system will help determine the actual \nburden of disease and identify effective measures for hepatitis prevention, control, and treatment. \nPolicy dialogue to allocate sufficient state budget funding for hepatitis infection prevention and \ncontrol in the health care facilities will be held.    \n \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2017. ADB. 2017. Country \nPartnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, \n2017\u20132019. Manila. \n2   World Health Organization. 2015. Viral Hepatitis in Mongolia: Situation and Response. Geneva.  \n3  Various publications since 1998 report a wide range of the prevalence of hepatitis B and C carriers in various \npopulation groups in Mongolia (blood donors, health workers, general population, males, and outpatients). The \nreported proportions vary from 8% to 29% for hepatitis B and from 2% to 48% for hepatitis C carriers. \n ", "2 \n5.  The government has developed and started implementing an action plan to improve the \nepidemiological status with respect to viral hepatitis. The government\u2019s Decree No. 112 of 12 April \n2017 approved the Healthy Liver Program and set a range of steps to mobilize the required funds, \nhuman resources, and an action plan to improve the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of \nhepatitis C.4 The government allocated MNT4.35 billion for screening and diagnosis, and another \nMNT23 billion for hepatitis C treatment from the 2017 state budget. The Ministry of Health (MOH) \nhas established working groups to improve screening and diagnosis of viral hepatitis. To support \nthis, the government needs additional funding to improve human resources capacity to implement \nregulatory measures, guidelines, and plans, and develop an active surveillance system. Several \ndevelopment partners are supporting the government to address these issues, but significant \ngaps exist in the areas of institutional and human resources capacity development, monitoring, \nand surveillance.         \n   \n6.  To implement the action plan, the government needs further help to (i) improve hospital \nhygiene and prevention systems, and standard operating procedures; (ii) implement screening \nand prevention of hospital-acquired viral hepatitis infection; (iii) undertake and make operational \nthe sample screening of vaccinated newborns, adolescents, and adults to assess efficacy of \nvaccination; (iv) initiate and regularize the screening of health workers, especially those involved \nin the delivery of invasive procedures and operations; (v) provide training to specialists in aimag \n(province) and Ulaanbaatar city hospitals on hepatitis screening, diagnosis, treatment, and \nprophylaxis; and (vi) provide training of government agencies, including  the MOH and the \nGovernment Agency for Specialized Inspection, to monitor hygiene and prevention in public and \nprivate health care facilities and other facilities administering invasive procedures such as tattoo \nsalons and dental offices. The MOH requested ADB\u2019s assistance to undertake the above-\nmentioned activities aimed at improving the epidemiological status and to identify the infection \nvector in health care facilities.  \n \n7.  ADB has been the largest external financier of the health sector in Mongolia and continues \nto play a key role in assisting the government in implementing health sector reforms which will \nimprove health care system efficiency and accessibility of affordable health services. ADB has \nbeen assisting the government to (i) develop a primary health care and referral system and \nintroduce public\u2013private partnership in service delivery, (ii) rationalize hospital services and \nimprove  hospital  management  and  governance,  (iii)  improve  sector  governance  through \nintroducing  licensing  and  accreditation  systems  and  using  information  and  communication \ntechnology for health data collection and reporting, and (iv) reform health care financing by \nintroducing new output-based payment methods and budgeting principles. Building on ADB\u2019s \nextensive experience, the government is requesting ADB support to improve the prevention and \ncontrol of hepatitis. This requires a specific set of epidemiologic surveys, policy dialogue, capacity \ndevelopment, and other measures to ensure that all aspects of hepatitis prevention and control \nare addressed and implemented in a sustainable manner. The TA will support the government\u2019s \nefforts to strengthen the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of viral hepatitis. The TA activities \nwill complement the blood safety and hospital hygiene improvement work under the ADB-funded \nFifth Health Sector Development Project.5  \n \n \n   \n                                                \n4  Government of Mongolia. 2017.

The TA will have the following outcome: viral hepatitis screening, diagnosis, \nand treatment improved.6  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n9.  Output  1:  Capacity  of  health  workers  for  delivering  viral  hepatitis  screening, \ndiagnosis, and treatment improved. Output 1 will focus on capacity building of health workers \nfor viral hepatitis screening, diagnosis, and treatment in health care facilities. The component will \ninclude the following: (i) update of clinical guidelines and standard operating procedures for \nscreening,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of  viral  hepatitis  based  on  latest  evidence  and  best \ninternational  practices;  (ii)  development  of  training  materials  for  screening,  diagnosis,  and \ntreatment; and (iii) training of health managers and workers of aimag and Ulaanbaatar city \nhospitals on up-to-date protocols, methods, and technologies for screening, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of viral hepatitis. \n \n10.  Output 2: An active surveillance system for viral hepatitis screening, diagnosis, and \nmonitoring developed. Output 2 will (i) develop and operationalize active surveillance systems \nfor hospital-acquired infections, including hepatitis; (ii) initiate and systematize the screening of \nhealth workers, especially those who perform invasive procedures and operations; (iii) undertake \na sample screening to assess the efficacy of hepatitis vaccination and treatment; (iv) develop and \noperationalize measures, including vaccination of health workers, to prevent hospital-acquired \nviral hepatitis infection; (v) develop health information technology solutions, applications, and \nsystems for managing national data on testing, care, and treatment outcomes of people living with \nviral hepatitis; and (vi) build the capacity of government health care agencies, including the MOH \nand the Government Agency for Specialized Inspection, to ensure compliance with hygiene \nstandards and use of prophylactics in public and private health care facilities, and other facilities \nthat administer invasive procedures. \n \n11.  The TA implementation will build on the following lessons from previous ADB-funded \nprojects7 in Mongolia\u2019s health sector: (i) strong project ownership by the government ensures \nsuccessful project implementation and achievement of the project goals; (ii) active dialogue and \ncollaboration of the project team with national and international project stakeholders is important; \nand (iii) involvement of technical experts from reputable international organizations, such as the \nWorld Health Organization, will add value to the project by applying the latest know-how in areas \nsuch  as  epidemiology,  evidence-based  medicine,  hospital-acquired  infections,  and  active \ninfections surveillance.  \n \n                                                \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n7   ADB. 2007.
