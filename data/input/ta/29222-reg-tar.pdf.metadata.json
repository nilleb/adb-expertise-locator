As part of the initial work of this\nRETA, the Bank implemented a feasibility study of the first of the high-priority subregional projects\nidentified under the RETA: improving the highway link between Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Ho Chi\nMinh City, and Vung Tau (Viet Nam's southern deep-sea port). On the basis of this study, it is\nconsidered appropriate to proceed with a project preparation technical assistance (TA) to improve\nthe Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City section of this link (the Project Road). A Bank mission\nvisited Viet Nam and Cambodia in April 1995, and Viet Nam again in July 1995, and reached\nunderstandings with the Governments of both countries on the scope, implementation\narrangements, and other aspects of the proposed TA.2\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Cambodia, Yunnan Province of the PRC, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet\nNam (the subregion), share borders and many natural resources, and together form a natural\neconomic area. They also have close cultural links. Since the mid-1940s, however, economic\ninteraction among them has been limited, largely because of the political environment that has\ndominated the subregion since that time. As a consequence, the development potential of the\narea, with the exception of Thailand, has not been realized. Recent political and economic\ndevelopments, however, give promise of closer economic linkages among the countries in the\nsubregion. For example, Viet Nam has recently joined the Association of South East Asian\nNations (ASEAN).\n3. Through the RETA, the governments of the subregion and the Bank have\nestablished institutional mechanisms through which economic cooperation in the subregion will be\nfacilitated by the participating countries themselves, with the assistance of the Bank and other aid\nagencies. A two-tier structure (first, the ministerial-level for policy matters, and second, forums\nand working groups) oversees implementation of projects and initiatives in specific sectors. For\nthe transport sector, a Subregional Transport Forum (STF), which includes the Bank, has been\nformed and meets regularly.\n4. The RETA identified several impediments to expanded economic cooperation. The\nmost obvious is the poor state of the subregion's basic infrastructure. Much of this is purely\nnational in scope, but important components extend across national boundaries. The most urgent\nneed is to improve the transportation system linking the countries. Except in the PRC, road is by\nfar the dominant transport mode in the subregion; therefore, road transport will be the dominant\nmode for intraregional passenger and freight movements, at least until traffic volumes increase to\nthe extent that other modes, rail for example, become viable. Within the subregion, however,\nexcept in Thailand, the road system generally has inadequate capacity and is in poor condition.\nThis applies particularly to the portions of the network that connect adjoining countries. Long\nperiods of isolation and hostility have constrained economic activity in border areas, and this in\nturn has constrained both domestic and cross-border traffic growth. Because of the absence of\ntraffic, and because the border areas were often dangerous, there has been little road\nimprovement or maintenance activity. As a consequence, border area roads are typically in very\npoor condition.\nRETA No. 5535; Promoting Subregional Cooperation Among Cambodia, The People's Republic of China, Lao\nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam, for $4.0 million, approved on 10 June 1993.\n2\t This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1995.\nI\t I-I - rS\t \t -\t II\t -\u2022\t\t \u2022\t .\t II\t -.\t-\t I\t --. -\tC. -\t -. -", "2\n5. The Project road is about 240 kilometers (km) long (160 km in Cambodia and 80\nkm in Viet Nam), and is an important component of the subregional road network, for domestic\nreasons (it serves heavily populated and agriculturally rich areas of both countries) and for its\nfunction as the main land transport link between Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital) and Viet\nNam's Ho Chi Minh City and Mekong delta. Both countries attach very high priority to upgrading\nthe road to facilitate economic interaction between them, reduce transport time and costs\nbetween the two terminal cities and their hinterlands, improve the efficiency of passenger and\nfreight movements, and encourage development along the road corridor. Much of the road is in\npoor condition (see para. 4), particularly in Cambodia, where the effects of isolation during the\nlate 1970s are still very much in evidence. In Viet Nam, where road sector related institutions\ncontinued to function, the road network is generally better. Towards Ho Chi Minh City, where the\nProject road serves an important domestic purpose, its condition is reasonable, and traffic\nvolumes are high. Closer to the border, however, traffic volumes are lower and the road's\ncondition is poor.\n6. The RETA feasibility study considered several improvement options, ranging from\nnew road construction on alternative alignments to rehabilitating the existing road without\nsignificantly changing existing geometry and width. Since Bank-sponsored subregional meetings\nhave agreed that priority would be given to improving existing facilities rather than constructing\nnew ones, the selected improvement option will be based on upgrading and rehabilitating the\nexisting road. This is also the most cost-effective and economically viable option. Provision will be\nmade where necessary for the considerable volumes of nonmotorized traffic in both countries.\nProvision will also be made for border crossing infrastructure, and for improvements to the ferry\ninfrastructure at the Mekong River crossing in Cambodia.\n7. Moving the Project from study to construction will require detailed engineering\ndesigns and contract documentation; evaluation and mitigation of environmental and social\nimpacts; civil works procurement and selection of supervision consultants; and, for the Project to\nhave maximum benefit, changes to the transit and customs procedures presently used at the\nborder crossing. The proposed TA will include all of these activities, and others, so that, when it\nhas been completed, the Project can proceed immediately to construction. In specific terms, the\nTA will include the detailed engineering and procurement-related activities that are usually loan-\nfinanced and included within the scope of a subsequent investment project. While this is not\nwholly in accordance with the Bank's TA policies, it reflects the subregional nature of the Project,\nin particular the need to ensure that common technical and procurement standards, and\nimplementation schedules, are applied to both countries' components. The TA will also provide\nvaluable training and capacity building opportunities for the Government agencies involved with\nthe Project. These agencies, as with most others in both countries, have had little recent\nexposure to commercial contracting and project management practices. It is essential that they be\nassisted to develop the necessary skills.\n8. Once complete, the improved road, and the simplified legal and regulatory\nenvironment related to cross-border movements of people, goods, and vehicles will demonstrate\nthe commitment of the Bank and the concerned Governments to the concept of subregional\ncooperation. It will also generate significant benefits for the people of both countries, through\nincreased cross-border trade and lower transport costs. Within Cambodia, in particular, the\nimproved road will facilitate communications with the capital. The TA will provide significant\nbenefits through technology transfer and capacity building within the Government agencies\ninvolved with the Project. Finally, the TA will serve as a prototype for similar subregional projects,\nwhether financed by the Bank, other agencies, or by the Governments.", "III.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The TA will prepare a Project for improving the highway linking Ho Chi Minh City\nand Phnom Penh that is economically viable, technically sound, cost effective, and\nenvironmentally and socially responsible.\nB.\t Scope\n10. Details of the TA's principal activities are provided in the terms of reference (see\nAppendix 1). Each of the principal activities will contain a training element for the governments'\ncounterpart personnel and domestic consultants.\n1.\t Review and Updating of the Feasibility Study\n11. Using the feasibility study as a basis, together with the findings of other relevant\nstudies in Cambodia and Viet Nam, this activity will include (i) appropriate traffic and axle load\nsurveys; (ii) a study of the potential for diversion from the existing inland waterway system\n(connecting Viet Nam's Mekong Delta and Ho Chi Minh City with Phnom Penh via the Mekong\nRiver) to the improved Project Road; (iii) a study of the ferry facilities where the Project Road\ncrosses the Mekong River in Cambodia; (iv) updated economic evaluations based on detailed\ncost estimates and projected traffic flows on the Project Road; and (v) an initial environmental\nexamination (lEE).\n2.\t Detailed Engineering\n12. This activity will include (i) surveys and investigations to establish the location and\ncondition of the existing road, material sources, etc.; (ii) preparation of detailed technical designs,\ncost estimates and technical specifications for the proposed improvements; and (iii) an\nunexploded ordnance survey. Detailed engineering will include ferries and ferry landing facilities\non the Mekong River in Cambodia and border crossing point infrastructure.\n3.\t Contract Documentation and Procurement Assistance\n13. This activity will include (i) developing contract packages suitable for international\ncompetitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement; (ii) preparing\nprequalification and bidding documentation; (iii) subject to the Bank approving advance action at\nan appropriate time, assisting with prequalification and procurement activities; and (iv) preparing\nimplementation schedules.\n4.\t Environmental and Social Impact Analysis\n14. For the environmental aspects of the Project, and depending on the findings of the\nlEE, this activity may include preparing detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) and\nsummary EIA reports. If the lEE or EIA reveals that the improvement works will result in\nsignificant impacts, either during construction or during the Project's service life, suitable\nmitigation measures will be developed and included in the Project designs, cost estimates, and\ncontract documentation.\n15. For the social aspects of the Project, the scope will include identification of social\nimpacts that may arise from the improvement works and, if these are significant, preparation of\nappropriate resettlement and rehabilitation action plans.\n.rLdh\t\nLtI1U .j v\t 'iJani \u00e7,iijc\u00c5 iTi,\u00e7,\u00e7 ritt i\t i i (.^1T, . vh.rl LI I\t 'JT i.I 1 rL.TU1 I\t 1 lU J Li\t I\t -----\t IT", "4\n5.\t Legal and Other Aspects of Cross-border Movement\n16. Because this activity affects both the proposed Project and all other subregional\ninitiatives, it will continue to be dealt with primarily within the framework of the subregional forums.\nHowever, because it is essential for the success of the proposed Project that movement across\nthe border occurs with as little impediment as possible, the TA will address this matter in detail.\nThe scope will include (i) a review of existing domestic laws, regulations, and international\nguidelines and protocols; (ii) a review of how these matters have been addressed and resolved\nbetween other countries with common borders; (iii) developing a common simplified approach to\nregulating cross-border movements; and (iv) assistance with preparing legislation and/or\nregulations that will give the adopted approach legal force.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The estimated cost of the TA is $3 100,000 of which the foreign exchange\ncomponent is $2,582,500 and the local currency component is $517,500 equivalent (see\nAppendix 2). The Bank will provide $3,000,000 as a grant, of which the foreign exchange\ncomponent will be $2,582,500 and the local currency component will be $417,500 equivalent. The\ngovernments will provide the remaining $100,000 in counterpart staff, local communications,\nmaps, reports, and other information. The governments have been informed that approval of the\nTA does not commit the Bank to finance ensuing Projects.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n18. Coordination between the two Governments and the Bank will require careful and\ndetailed attention. There is an obvious potential for delay while a government considers a\nparticular aspect of the Project, or if one government declines to accept what has been accepted\nby the other. The proposed implementation arrangements have been designed to reduce this risk.\n19. The Bank will be the Project Executing Agency. For Viet Nam, the Project\nImplementing Agency will be the Project Management Unit of the My Thuan Bridge Project (PMU-\nMTBP),1 an agency of the Ministry of Transport. For Cambodia, the Implementing Agency will be\nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport. For day-to-day coordination of the TA, the Executing\nand Implementing Agencies will form a Coordinating Committee. For Viet Nam, permanent\nmembers of the committee will include the General Director of PMU-MTBP or his nominee, and a\nrepresentative from the Ministry of Transport's Planning and Investment Department. For\nCambodia, permanent members will include the State Secretary of the Ministry of Public Works\nand Transport. When required, the Committee will be joined by, or will obtain advice from,\nrepresentatives of other relevant government agencies, in particular those dealing with cross-\nborder issues. The Committee will also include the Bank, and the TA consultant's project\nmanager as a permanent member with broad responsibility for liaison and coordination between\nthe Bank and the two country Implementing Agencies. The Committee will meet once each month\nfor the duration of the TA, alternatively in Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh. Minutes of these\nmeetings will be provided to the Bank, and will be the principal formal means by which the Bank\nwill carry out its Executing Agency role. The Bank will keep the STF informed of Project status\nduring scheduled STF meetings.\n20. The consultants, to be selected by the Bank in accordance with its  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants, will provide about 85 person-months of international consultants and\nPMU-MTBP is responsible for implementing an Australian Government-financed bridge project on the Mekong\nRiver at My Thuan, southwest of Ho Chi Minh City.", "5\nabout 100 person-months of senior domestic consultants. In broad terms, the expertise required\nwill include project management, transport economics, highway and structural engineering,\nsurveying, hydraulic engineering and hydrology, geotechnical and pavement engineering, cost\nestimating, computer assisted design, environmental and social assessments of road projects,\ncivil works procurement, unexploded ordnance surveys, and international law. The consultants will\nalso provide all technical and administrative support staff, office space, furniture, equipment,\ncomputer software, transport, etc. They will be based in either Ho Chi Minh City or Phnom Penh,\nand will establish a presence in the other city.\n21. The feasibility study review, including the lEE and the inland water transport\ndiversion study, are to be completed within two months of the services commencing.\nEnvironmental and social impact analyses, and the resettlement and rehabilitation action plan,\nare to be completed by the sixth month of the services. Detailed engineering, updated economic\nevaluation, and preparation of contract documentation are to be completed by the eleventh month\nof the services. Procurement assistance for prequalification of civil works contractors, bid\ninvitation, prebid submission activities, and bid evaluation, all of which involve a number of\ngovernment and Bank approvals, should be completed by about the eighteenth month of the\nservices.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n22. It is considered that the proposed technical assistance to the Governments of the\nKingdom of Cambodia and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is necessary for the purpose of the\nHo Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh Highway Project. The President recommends that the Board\napprove the proposed technical assistance, on a grant basis, in the amount of $3.0 million.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT PREPARATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nTHE GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION - INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT:\nHO CHI MINH CITY TO PHNOM PENH HIGHWAY PROJECT\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE\nA.\t Objectives and Scope of the Technical Assistance\n1. The objective of the Technical Assistance (TA) is to prepare a project for improving\nthe highway linking Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh that is economically viable, technically\nsound, cost effective, and environmentally and socially responsible. Its scope will comprise the\nfollowing principal activities:\n(i) review and updating aspects of the feasibility study;\n(ii) detailed engineering;\n(iii) contract documentation and procurement assistance;\n(iv) environmental and social impact analysis; and\n(v) legal and other aspects of cross border movement of people, goods, and vehicles.\nB.\t Detailed Terms of Reference\n1.\t Review and Update Aspects of the Feasibility Study\n2.\t Using the feasibility study as a basis, together with the findings of other relevant\nstudies in Viet Nam and Cambodia, the consultant will undertake the following activities:\n(i) Conduct traffic counts at appropriate locations and axle load surveys to confirm or,\nif necessary, modify the feasibility study's estimates of current and projected\nmotorized and nonmotorized traffic movements on the Project road.\n(ii) Study the potential to divert traffic from the inland waterway system between the\nMekong Delta and Phnom Penh to the Project road, and take this traffic into\naccount in the economic evaluation and design of the improvement works.1\n(iii) Where the Project road crosses the Mekong River in Cambodia, undertake studies\nto identify improvements required to ferry landings, parking areas, and ferry\ncapacity to provide adequate service over a 20-year period, identifying when\nadditional ferry capacity should be provided during that period to maintain the level\nof service. The studies will include a review of present tariffs and, if appropriate,\nproposals for increases in tariffs to cover ferry operating and maintenance costs.\nA useful data source will be the feasibility study for the My Thuan Bridge Project, on the Mekong River in Viet\nNam.\n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 10)", "r^\nAppendix 1, page 2\n(iv) When detailed engineering for the improvement works has been completed, carry\nout an economic evaluation of each section and the Project road as a whole, for\nwith and without project cases. The economic evaluations of the different road\nsections should have a national focus when it comes to applying economic prices\nto Project costs and benefits, but the review should also investigate particularly the\nlikely impact from generated and diverted international traffic, including traffic\ndiverted from water to road.\n(v) Carry out an initial environmental examination (IEE) in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Environmental Impacts of Infrastructure Projects.\n2.\t Detailed Engineering\n3. To the extent possible, the improved road will follow the existing road alignment.\nTaking into account the findings and recommendations of the feasibility report, the consultant will\nprepare detailed designs for the improvement works. In doing so, the consultant will use current\ninternational practices and standards, and will use appropriate computer-aided design\ntechniques. Tasks will include the following:\n(i) From Government and other sources, assess the extent to which unexploded\nordnance may be present within the road corridor. If the assessment indicates\ncontaminated areas, develop an approach to clearing them, to be included in the\nscope of the subsequent construction contracts.'\n(ii) Carry out topographic, aerial (if considered necessary), and other surveys as\nrequired, including establishing permanent surrey control points.\n(iii) Investigate the existing pavement structure, including deflection or similar tests,\nexcavating test pits at appropriate intervals, etc.\n(iv) Establish the suitability of locally available construction materials, and identify\nquarries and borrow pits.\n(v) Undertake the necessary hydraulic and hydrological studies to determine roadside\nand cross drainage requirements, embankment heights, etc.\n(vi) Prepare an inventory of existing drainage structures, based on the feasibility study,\nto include their location, condition, adequacy, need for replacement or\nrehabilitation, etc.\n(vii) Identify locations where road safety problems exist.\n(viii) Identify the nature and location of potential environmental and social impacts.\n(ix) Based on the results of items (i) to (viii), together with traffic and axle load data,\ntraffic safety, the IEE and the Environmental Impact Assessment, if required, and\nother relevant inputs, prepare practical and cost-effective geometric (horizontal,\nPreliminary advice indicates that there is no significant ordnance problem. However, because the road lies\nwithin an area that has been subject to combat, prudence dictates a need for a detailed assessment.", "8\nAppendix 1, page 3\nvertical, intersection, etc), pavement and structural designs. Pavement designs\nshould provide for overlays where appropriate. Structural designs will provide for\nreplacement or rehabilitation of bridges and other drainage structures depending\non condition, capacity, etc. In areas where nonmotorized vehicle volumes are high,\nthe designs will include provision for this traffic.\n(x) Based on the Mekong River ferry study (see item 1 [iii]), prepare designs for ferry\nlandings and parking areas and, if the study has shown that the existing ferries do\nnot have adequate capacity for at least 5 years of projected traffic, prepare outline\ndesigns and performance specifications for ferry vessels.\n(xi) Taking into account projected cross-border traffic, and the immigration, customs,\nbond, and other requirements of the relevant agencies of both governments, and\nthe results of the legal and other studies undertaken as part of this TA (see para.\n6), prepare designs for border facilities\n(xii) Taking into account work done by the Government, prepare designs for an\nappropriate grade-separated interchange at An Suong, where Highway 22\nintersects with the Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road.\n(xiii) Prepare detailed designs for a second parallel bridge, about 480 meter long, at the\nBin Phuc River on the Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road, and for rehabilitating the\nexisting bridge at the same location.\n(xiv) From items (I) to (xiii), calculate quantities for all work items. Based on these, and\ntaking into account work done for other similar projects in Cambodia, Viet Nam,\nand elsewhere, prepare detailed cost estimates for each work item, broken down\ninto foreign and local cost components, the latter to include separately identified\nlocal taxes, duties, and similar elements.\n(xv) Prepare detailed technical specifications for each work item, taking into account\nrelevant specifications in use in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and elsewhere for similar\nworks.\n(xvi) Develop and implement training programs for counterparts and domestic\nspecialists from both countries, to include site surveys and investigations,\npavement design, geometric design, and the use of computers for these and other\ndetailed engineering activities.\n3.\t Contract Documentation and Procurement Assistance\n4. Although the Project is being prepared through a single TA, it will be implemented\nas two separate projects, one in each country. Accordingly, separate contract documentation will\nbe required for each country's works although, to the extent possible, the documentation for each\nwill be identical. Civil works procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on Procurement. The Consultant's tasks include those set out below. Because items\n(iii) and (iv) depend on the Bank allowing procurement to commence before the Project loans\nhave been approved, and on the loan processing schedules, these two activities may be deferred\nor may be removed from the TA's scope. Accordingly, consultants' proposals are to identify\nseparately the inputs for, and the costs associated with, these activities.", "9\nAppendix 1, page 4\n(i) Develop contract packages suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB);\n(ii) Prepare prequalification and contract documentation, based generally on the\ndocuments prepared under the ongoing Bank-financed Second Road Improvement\nProject in Viet Nam.1\n(iii) Assist the governments' Implementing Agencies (the lAs) with prequalification of\npotential contractors.\n(iv) Assist the lAs with selecting contractors for the works.\n(v) Prepare detailed project implementation schedules.\n(vi) Prepare detailed terms of reference, staffing and other inputs, and cost estimates\nfor the consulting services required for contract supervision.\n(vii) Develop and implement training programs for national counterparts from both\ncountries, to include the use of the Federation Internationale des lngenieurs-\nConseils (FIDIC) conditions of contract for civil engineering construction, the\npurpose of prequalification and how it should be undertaken, preparation and\nevaluation of civil works bids, etc.\n4.\t Environmental and Social Impact Analyses\n5. In preparing designs, the consultant will minimize to the extent possible the\nenvironmental and social impacts arising from the improvement works. Specifically, the consultant\nwill undertake the following activities:\n(i) For the environmental aspects of the Project, and depending on the findings of the\nlEE, this activity may include preparation of a EIA and summary environmental\nimpact assessment (SEIA) reports. If the lEE or EIA reveals that the improvement\nworks will result in significant impacts, either during construction or during the\nProject's service life, suitable mitigation measures will be developed and included\nin the Project designs, cost estimates, and contract documentation. If required, the\nEIA report will be prepared in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the\nEnvironmental Impacts of Infrastructure Projects and Environmental Assessment\nRequirements and Environmental Review Procedures (March 1993). If an EIA is\nrequired, an SEIA in a format acceptable to the Bank and the governments will be\nprepared.\n(ii) Identify the social impacts that may arise from the improvement works and, if these\nare significant, prepare an appropriate resettlement and rehabilitation action plan in\naccordance with Government guidelines and procedures and the Bank's\nGuidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations and the\nrelated Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects, and estimate\nall costs related to the implementation of the plan.

Since this activity impacts not only on the proposed Project but on the Bank's\noverall subregional initiative, it will continue to be dealt with primarily within the framework of that\ninitiative. However, since it is essential for the success of the proposed Project that movement\nacross the Cambodia-Viet Nam border occurs with as little impediment as possible, the TA will\naddress this matter in detail. The approach developed in this Project will become a model for\naddressing similar issues in other subregional transport projects. The tasks to be undertaken by\nthe consultant under this activity will include the following:\n(i) Carry out a detailed review of the present legislative and administrative and\nprocedural framework within which cross-border movement of people, goods, and\nvehicles operates.\n(ii) Review existing international conventions on transport facilitation, including those\ncited in the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP) resolution 48/11, and examine their relevance in resolving cross-\nborder issues between Cambodia and Viet Nam.\n(iii) Examine how such matters have been addressed between other countries, both\nwithin the region and elsewhere, that share a common border and a relatively free\nmovement across it.\n(iv) Based on items (i) to (iii), initiate discussions with the agencies of both\ngovernments that are concerned with cross-border movements of all types, and\nwork towards developing a common, simplified approach that is acceptable to both.\n(v) Once an approach acceptable to both governments has been developed, assist\nwith the preparation of the necessary legislation and/or regulations and\nagreements that will give it legal force.\nC.\t Implementation\n1.\t Consultant's Inputs\n7. Work schedules and cost estimates for the TA have been prepared assuming the\nfollowing staffing inputs. Consultants may vary the expertise mix to suit their approach to the\nProject without, however, significantly changing the proportions of international and senior\ndomestic inputs. Consultants must also ensure that there is a reasonable balance of domestic\nspecialist inputs from Cambodia and Viet Nam. The following consultant services are required:\n(i) international consultants - about 85 person-months, with broad expertise in\nproject management, transport economics, highway and structural engineering,\nsurveying, hydraulic engineering and hydrology, geotechnical and pavement\nengineering, cost estimating, computer assisted design, environmental and social\nassessments of road projects, civil works procurement, unexploded ordnance\nsurveys, and international law.", "\t\n11\nAppendix 1, page 6\n(ii)\t senior domestic consultants \u2014 about 100 person-months, generally and where\nappropriate with the same range of expertise as the international consultants.\n8. The consultant will provide all technical and administrative support staff required to\nimplement the TA, together with office space, furniture, equipment, computers and computer\nsoftware, transport, etc. The consultant may base the Project team in either or both of the\nterminal cities, at its choice, and will establish a presence in the other city. The consultant may\nalso undertake some of the work in its home office or elsewhere, if it is significantly cost-effective\nto do so. However, since an important objective of the Bank's TA program is enhancing the\ncapacity of domestic institutions, the extent to which design and other work is undertaken outside\nthe countries is to be kept to a reasonable minimum.\n2.\t Executing and Implementing Agencies\n9. The Bank will be the Project Executing Agency. For Viet Nam, the Project\nImplementing Agency will be the Project Management Unit of the My Thuan Bridge Project (PMU-\nMTBP), an agency of the Ministry of Transport. For Cambodia, the Implementing Agency will be\nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport. For day-to-day coordination of the TA, the Bank and\nthe Implementing Agencies will form a Coordinating Committee. The consultant also will be a\nmember of the committee, responsible for logistical arrangements, preparation of agendas and\nminutes, and follow-up action.\n3.\t Implementation Schedule\n10. The feasibility study traffic and economic evaluation reviews, the inland water\ntransport diversion study, and the IEE, are to be completed within eight weeks of the services\ncommencing, and their results are to included in the inception report (see reporting requirements\nbelow). Environmental and social impact analyses, and the resettlement and rehabilitation action\nplan, are to be completed by the sixth month of the services.

As part of the initial work of this\nRETA, the Bank implemented a feasibility study of the first of the high-priority subregional projects\nidentified under the RETA: improving the highway link between Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Ho Chi\nMinh City, and Vung Tau (Viet Nam's southern deep-sea port). On the basis of this study, it is\nconsidered appropriate to proceed with a project preparation technical assistance (TA) to improve\nthe Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City section of this link (the Project Road). A Bank mission\nvisited Viet Nam and Cambodia in April 1995, and Viet Nam again in July 1995, and reached\nunderstandings with the Governments of both countries on the scope, implementation\narrangements, and other aspects of the proposed TA.2\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Cambodia, Yunnan Province of the PRC, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet\nNam (the subregion), share borders and many natural resources, and together form a natural\neconomic area. They also have close cultural links. Since the mid-1940s, however, economic\ninteraction among them has been limited, largely because of the political environment that has\ndominated the subregion since that time. As a consequence, the development potential of the\narea, with the exception of Thailand, has not been realized. Recent political and economic\ndevelopments, however, give promise of closer economic linkages among the countries in the\nsubregion. For example, Viet Nam has recently joined the Association of South East Asian\nNations (ASEAN).\n3. Through the RETA, the governments of the subregion and the Bank have\nestablished institutional mechanisms through which economic cooperation in the subregion will be\nfacilitated by the participating countries themselves, with the assistance of the Bank and other aid\nagencies. A two-tier structure (first, the ministerial-level for policy matters, and second, forums\nand working groups) oversees implementation of projects and initiatives in specific sectors. For\nthe transport sector, a Subregional Transport Forum (STF), which includes the Bank, has been\nformed and meets regularly.\n4. The RETA identified several impediments to expanded economic cooperation. The\nmost obvious is the poor state of the subregion's basic infrastructure. Much of this is purely\nnational in scope, but important components extend across national boundaries. The most urgent\nneed is to improve the transportation system linking the countries. Except in the PRC, road is by\nfar the dominant transport mode in the subregion; therefore, road transport will be the dominant\nmode for intraregional passenger and freight movements, at least until traffic volumes increase to\nthe extent that other modes, rail for example, become viable. Within the subregion, however,\nexcept in Thailand, the road system generally has inadequate capacity and is in poor condition.\nThis applies particularly to the portions of the network that connect adjoining countries. Long\nperiods of isolation and hostility have constrained economic activity in border areas, and this in\nturn has constrained both domestic and cross-border traffic growth. Because of the absence of\ntraffic, and because the border areas were often dangerous, there has been little road\nimprovement or maintenance activity. As a consequence, border area roads are typically in very\npoor condition.\nRETA No. 5535; Promoting Subregional Cooperation Among Cambodia, The People's Republic of China, Lao\nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam, for $4.0 million, approved on 10 June 1993.\n2\t This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1995.\nI\t I-I - rS\t \t -\t II\t -\u2022\t\t \u2022\t .\t II\t -.\t-\t I\t --. -\tC. -\t -. -", "2\n5. The Project road is about 240 kilometers (km) long (160 km in Cambodia and 80\nkm in Viet Nam), and is an important component of the subregional road network, for domestic\nreasons (it serves heavily populated and agriculturally rich areas of both countries) and for its\nfunction as the main land transport link between Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital) and Viet\nNam's Ho Chi Minh City and Mekong delta. Both countries attach very high priority to upgrading\nthe road to facilitate economic interaction between them, reduce transport time and costs\nbetween the two terminal cities and their hinterlands, improve the efficiency of passenger and\nfreight movements, and encourage development along the road corridor. Much of the road is in\npoor condition (see para. 4), particularly in Cambodia, where the effects of isolation during the\nlate 1970s are still very much in evidence. In Viet Nam, where road sector related institutions\ncontinued to function, the road network is generally better. Towards Ho Chi Minh City, where the\nProject road serves an important domestic purpose, its condition is reasonable, and traffic\nvolumes are high. Closer to the border, however, traffic volumes are lower and the road's\ncondition is poor.\n6. The RETA feasibility study considered several improvement options, ranging from\nnew road construction on alternative alignments to rehabilitating the existing road without\nsignificantly changing existing geometry and width. Since Bank-sponsored subregional meetings\nhave agreed that priority would be given to improving existing facilities rather than constructing\nnew ones, the selected improvement option will be based on upgrading and rehabilitating the\nexisting road. This is also the most cost-effective and economically viable option. Provision will be\nmade where necessary for the considerable volumes of nonmotorized traffic in both countries.\nProvision will also be made for border crossing infrastructure, and for improvements to the ferry\ninfrastructure at the Mekong River crossing in Cambodia.\n7. Moving the Project from study to construction will require detailed engineering\ndesigns and contract documentation; evaluation and mitigation of environmental and social\nimpacts; civil works procurement and selection of supervision consultants; and, for the Project to\nhave maximum benefit, changes to the transit and customs procedures presently used at the\nborder crossing. The proposed TA will include all of these activities, and others, so that, when it\nhas been completed, the Project can proceed immediately to construction. In specific terms, the\nTA will include the detailed engineering and procurement-related activities that are usually loan-\nfinanced and included within the scope of a subsequent investment project. While this is not\nwholly in accordance with the Bank's TA policies, it reflects the subregional nature of the Project,\nin particular the need to ensure that common technical and procurement standards, and\nimplementation schedules, are applied to both countries' components. The TA will also provide\nvaluable training and capacity building opportunities for the Government agencies involved with\nthe Project. These agencies, as with most others in both countries, have had little recent\nexposure to commercial contracting and project management practices. It is essential that they be\nassisted to develop the necessary skills.\n8. Once complete, the improved road, and the simplified legal and regulatory\nenvironment related to cross-border movements of people, goods, and vehicles will demonstrate\nthe commitment of the Bank and the concerned Governments to the concept of subregional\ncooperation. It will also generate significant benefits for the people of both countries, through\nincreased cross-border trade and lower transport costs. Within Cambodia, in particular, the\nimproved road will facilitate communications with the capital. The TA will provide significant\nbenefits through technology transfer and capacity building within the Government agencies\ninvolved with the Project. Finally, the TA will serve as a prototype for similar subregional projects,\nwhether financed by the Bank, other agencies, or by the Governments.", "III.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The TA will prepare a Project for improving the highway linking Ho Chi Minh City\nand Phnom Penh that is economically viable, technically sound, cost effective, and\nenvironmentally and socially responsible.\nB.\t Scope\n10. Details of the TA's principal activities are provided in the terms of reference (see\nAppendix 1). Each of the principal activities will contain a training element for the governments'\ncounterpart personnel and domestic consultants.\n1.\t Review and Updating of the Feasibility Study\n11. Using the feasibility study as a basis, together with the findings of other relevant\nstudies in Cambodia and Viet Nam, this activity will include (i) appropriate traffic and axle load\nsurveys; (ii) a study of the potential for diversion from the existing inland waterway system\n(connecting Viet Nam's Mekong Delta and Ho Chi Minh City with Phnom Penh via the Mekong\nRiver) to the improved Project Road; (iii) a study of the ferry facilities where the Project Road\ncrosses the Mekong River in Cambodia; (iv) updated economic evaluations based on detailed\ncost estimates and projected traffic flows on the Project Road; and (v) an initial environmental\nexamination (lEE).\n2.\t Detailed Engineering\n12. This activity will include (i) surveys and investigations to establish the location and\ncondition of the existing road, material sources, etc.; (ii) preparation of detailed technical designs,\ncost estimates and technical specifications for the proposed improvements; and (iii) an\nunexploded ordnance survey. Detailed engineering will include ferries and ferry landing facilities\non the Mekong River in Cambodia and border crossing point infrastructure.\n3.\t Contract Documentation and Procurement Assistance\n13. This activity will include (i) developing contract packages suitable for international\ncompetitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement; (ii) preparing\nprequalification and bidding documentation; (iii) subject to the Bank approving advance action at\nan appropriate time, assisting with prequalification and procurement activities; and (iv) preparing\nimplementation schedules.\n4.\t Environmental and Social Impact Analysis\n14. For the environmental aspects of the Project, and depending on the findings of the\nlEE, this activity may include preparing detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) and\nsummary EIA reports. If the lEE or EIA reveals that the improvement works will result in\nsignificant impacts, either during construction or during the Project's service life, suitable\nmitigation measures will be developed and included in the Project designs, cost estimates, and\ncontract documentation.\n15. For the social aspects of the Project, the scope will include identification of social\nimpacts that may arise from the improvement works and, if these are significant, preparation of\nappropriate resettlement and rehabilitation action plans.\n.rLdh\t\nLtI1U .j v\t 'iJani \u00e7,iijc\u00c5 iTi,\u00e7,\u00e7 ritt i\t i i (.^1T, . vh.rl LI I\t 'JT i.I 1 rL.TU1 I\t 1 lU J Li\t I\t -----\t IT", "4\n5.\t Legal and Other Aspects of Cross-border Movement\n16. Because this activity affects both the proposed Project and all other subregional\ninitiatives, it will continue to be dealt with primarily within the framework of the subregional forums.\nHowever, because it is essential for the success of the proposed Project that movement across\nthe border occurs with as little impediment as possible, the TA will address this matter in detail.\nThe scope will include (i) a review of existing domestic laws, regulations, and international\nguidelines and protocols; (ii) a review of how these matters have been addressed and resolved\nbetween other countries with common borders; (iii) developing a common simplified approach to\nregulating cross-border movements; and (iv) assistance with preparing legislation and/or\nregulations that will give the adopted approach legal force.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The estimated cost of the TA is $3 100,000 of which the foreign exchange\ncomponent is $2,582,500 and the local currency component is $517,500 equivalent (see\nAppendix 2). The Bank will provide $3,000,000 as a grant, of which the foreign exchange\ncomponent will be $2,582,500 and the local currency component will be $417,500 equivalent. The\ngovernments will provide the remaining $100,000 in counterpart staff, local communications,\nmaps, reports, and other information. The governments have been informed that approval of the\nTA does not commit the Bank to finance ensuing Projects.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n18. Coordination between the two Governments and the Bank will require careful and\ndetailed attention. There is an obvious potential for delay while a government considers a\nparticular aspect of the Project, or if one government declines to accept what has been accepted\nby the other. The proposed implementation arrangements have been designed to reduce this risk.\n19. The Bank will be the Project Executing Agency. For Viet Nam, the Project\nImplementing Agency will be the Project Management Unit of the My Thuan Bridge Project (PMU-\nMTBP),1 an agency of the Ministry of Transport. For Cambodia, the Implementing Agency will be\nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport. For day-to-day coordination of the TA, the Executing\nand Implementing Agencies will form a Coordinating Committee. For Viet Nam, permanent\nmembers of the committee will include the General Director of PMU-MTBP or his nominee, and a\nrepresentative from the Ministry of Transport's Planning and Investment Department. For\nCambodia, permanent members will include the State Secretary of the Ministry of Public Works\nand Transport. When required, the Committee will be joined by, or will obtain advice from,\nrepresentatives of other relevant government agencies, in particular those dealing with cross-\nborder issues. The Committee will also include the Bank, and the TA consultant's project\nmanager as a permanent member with broad responsibility for liaison and coordination between\nthe Bank and the two country Implementing Agencies. The Committee will meet once each month\nfor the duration of the TA, alternatively in Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh. Minutes of these\nmeetings will be provided to the Bank, and will be the principal formal means by which the Bank\nwill carry out its Executing Agency role. The Bank will keep the STF informed of Project status\nduring scheduled STF meetings.\n20. The consultants, to be selected by the Bank in accordance with its  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants, will provide about 85 person-months of international consultants and\nPMU-MTBP is responsible for implementing an Australian Government-financed bridge project on the Mekong\nRiver at My Thuan, southwest of Ho Chi Minh City.", "5\nabout 100 person-months of senior domestic consultants. In broad terms, the expertise required\nwill include project management, transport economics, highway and structural engineering,\nsurveying, hydraulic engineering and hydrology, geotechnical and pavement engineering, cost\nestimating, computer assisted design, environmental and social assessments of road projects,\ncivil works procurement, unexploded ordnance surveys, and international law. The consultants will\nalso provide all technical and administrative support staff, office space, furniture, equipment,\ncomputer software, transport, etc. They will be based in either Ho Chi Minh City or Phnom Penh,\nand will establish a presence in the other city.\n21. The feasibility study review, including the lEE and the inland water transport\ndiversion study, are to be completed within two months of the services commencing.\nEnvironmental and social impact analyses, and the resettlement and rehabilitation action plan,\nare to be completed by the sixth month of the services. Detailed engineering, updated economic\nevaluation, and preparation of contract documentation are to be completed by the eleventh month\nof the services. Procurement assistance for prequalification of civil works contractors, bid\ninvitation, prebid submission activities, and bid evaluation, all of which involve a number of\ngovernment and Bank approvals, should be completed by about the eighteenth month of the\nservices.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n22. It is considered that the proposed technical assistance to the Governments of the\nKingdom of Cambodia and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is necessary for the purpose of the\nHo Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh Highway Project. The President recommends that the Board\napprove the proposed technical assistance, on a grant basis, in the amount of $3.0 million.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT PREPARATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nTHE GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION - INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT:\nHO CHI MINH CITY TO PHNOM PENH HIGHWAY PROJECT\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE\nA.\t Objectives and Scope of the Technical Assistance\n1. The objective of the Technical Assistance (TA) is to prepare a project for improving\nthe highway linking Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh that is economically viable, technically\nsound, cost effective, and environmentally and socially responsible. Its scope will comprise the\nfollowing principal activities:\n(i) review and updating aspects of the feasibility study;\n(ii) detailed engineering;\n(iii) contract documentation and procurement assistance;\n(iv) environmental and social impact analysis; and\n(v) legal and other aspects of cross border movement of people, goods, and vehicles.\nB.\t Detailed Terms of Reference\n1.\t Review and Update Aspects of the Feasibility Study\n2.\t Using the feasibility study as a basis, together with the findings of other relevant\nstudies in Viet Nam and Cambodia, the consultant will undertake the following activities:\n(i) Conduct traffic counts at appropriate locations and axle load surveys to confirm or,\nif necessary, modify the feasibility study's estimates of current and projected\nmotorized and nonmotorized traffic movements on the Project road.\n(ii) Study the potential to divert traffic from the inland waterway system between the\nMekong Delta and Phnom Penh to the Project road, and take this traffic into\naccount in the economic evaluation and design of the improvement works.1\n(iii) Where the Project road crosses the Mekong River in Cambodia, undertake studies\nto identify improvements required to ferry landings, parking areas, and ferry\ncapacity to provide adequate service over a 20-year period, identifying when\nadditional ferry capacity should be provided during that period to maintain the level\nof service. The studies will include a review of present tariffs and, if appropriate,\nproposals for increases in tariffs to cover ferry operating and maintenance costs.\nA useful data source will be the feasibility study for the My Thuan Bridge Project, on the Mekong River in Viet\nNam.\n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 10)", "r^\nAppendix 1, page 2\n(iv) When detailed engineering for the improvement works has been completed, carry\nout an economic evaluation of each section and the Project road as a whole, for\nwith and without project cases. The economic evaluations of the different road\nsections should have a national focus when it comes to applying economic prices\nto Project costs and benefits, but the review should also investigate particularly the\nlikely impact from generated and diverted international traffic, including traffic\ndiverted from water to road.\n(v) Carry out an initial environmental examination (IEE) in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Environmental Impacts of Infrastructure Projects.\n2.\t Detailed Engineering\n3. To the extent possible, the improved road will follow the existing road alignment.\nTaking into account the findings and recommendations of the feasibility report, the consultant will\nprepare detailed designs for the improvement works. In doing so, the consultant will use current\ninternational practices and standards, and will use appropriate computer-aided design\ntechniques. Tasks will include the following:\n(i) From Government and other sources, assess the extent to which unexploded\nordnance may be present within the road corridor. If the assessment indicates\ncontaminated areas, develop an approach to clearing them, to be included in the\nscope of the subsequent construction contracts.'\n(ii) Carry out topographic, aerial (if considered necessary), and other surveys as\nrequired, including establishing permanent surrey control points.\n(iii) Investigate the existing pavement structure, including deflection or similar tests,\nexcavating test pits at appropriate intervals, etc.\n(iv) Establish the suitability of locally available construction materials, and identify\nquarries and borrow pits.\n(v) Undertake the necessary hydraulic and hydrological studies to determine roadside\nand cross drainage requirements, embankment heights, etc.\n(vi) Prepare an inventory of existing drainage structures, based on the feasibility study,\nto include their location, condition, adequacy, need for replacement or\nrehabilitation, etc.\n(vii) Identify locations where road safety problems exist.\n(viii) Identify the nature and location of potential environmental and social impacts.\n(ix) Based on the results of items (i) to (viii), together with traffic and axle load data,\ntraffic safety, the IEE and the Environmental Impact Assessment, if required, and\nother relevant inputs, prepare practical and cost-effective geometric (horizontal,\nPreliminary advice indicates that there is no significant ordnance problem. However, because the road lies\nwithin an area that has been subject to combat, prudence dictates a need for a detailed assessment.", "8\nAppendix 1, page 3\nvertical, intersection, etc), pavement and structural designs. Pavement designs\nshould provide for overlays where appropriate. Structural designs will provide for\nreplacement or rehabilitation of bridges and other drainage structures depending\non condition, capacity, etc. In areas where nonmotorized vehicle volumes are high,\nthe designs will include provision for this traffic.\n(x) Based on the Mekong River ferry study (see item 1 [iii]), prepare designs for ferry\nlandings and parking areas and, if the study has shown that the existing ferries do\nnot have adequate capacity for at least 5 years of projected traffic, prepare outline\ndesigns and performance specifications for ferry vessels.\n(xi) Taking into account projected cross-border traffic, and the immigration, customs,\nbond, and other requirements of the relevant agencies of both governments, and\nthe results of the legal and other studies undertaken as part of this TA (see para.\n6), prepare designs for border facilities\n(xii) Taking into account work done by the Government, prepare designs for an\nappropriate grade-separated interchange at An Suong, where Highway 22\nintersects with the Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road.\n(xiii) Prepare detailed designs for a second parallel bridge, about 480 meter long, at the\nBin Phuc River on the Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road, and for rehabilitating the\nexisting bridge at the same location.\n(xiv) From items (I) to (xiii), calculate quantities for all work items. Based on these, and\ntaking into account work done for other similar projects in Cambodia, Viet Nam,\nand elsewhere, prepare detailed cost estimates for each work item, broken down\ninto foreign and local cost components, the latter to include separately identified\nlocal taxes, duties, and similar elements.\n(xv) Prepare detailed technical specifications for each work item, taking into account\nrelevant specifications in use in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and elsewhere for similar\nworks.\n(xvi) Develop and implement training programs for counterparts and domestic\nspecialists from both countries, to include site surveys and investigations,\npavement design, geometric design, and the use of computers for these and other\ndetailed engineering activities.\n3.\t Contract Documentation and Procurement Assistance\n4. Although the Project is being prepared through a single TA, it will be implemented\nas two separate projects, one in each country. Accordingly, separate contract documentation will\nbe required for each country's works although, to the extent possible, the documentation for each\nwill be identical. Civil works procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on Procurement. The Consultant's tasks include those set out below. Because items\n(iii) and (iv) depend on the Bank allowing procurement to commence before the Project loans\nhave been approved, and on the loan processing schedules, these two activities may be deferred\nor may be removed from the TA's scope. Accordingly, consultants' proposals are to identify\nseparately the inputs for, and the costs associated with, these activities.", "9\nAppendix 1, page 4\n(i) Develop contract packages suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB);\n(ii) Prepare prequalification and contract documentation, based generally on the\ndocuments prepared under the ongoing Bank-financed Second Road Improvement\nProject in Viet Nam.1\n(iii) Assist the governments' Implementing Agencies (the lAs) with prequalification of\npotential contractors.\n(iv) Assist the lAs with selecting contractors for the works.\n(v) Prepare detailed project implementation schedules.\n(vi) Prepare detailed terms of reference, staffing and other inputs, and cost estimates\nfor the consulting services required for contract supervision.\n(vii) Develop and implement training programs for national counterparts from both\ncountries, to include the use of the Federation Internationale des lngenieurs-\nConseils (FIDIC) conditions of contract for civil engineering construction, the\npurpose of prequalification and how it should be undertaken, preparation and\nevaluation of civil works bids, etc.\n4.\t Environmental and Social Impact Analyses\n5. In preparing designs, the consultant will minimize to the extent possible the\nenvironmental and social impacts arising from the improvement works. Specifically, the consultant\nwill undertake the following activities:\n(i) For the environmental aspects of the Project, and depending on the findings of the\nlEE, this activity may include preparation of a EIA and summary environmental\nimpact assessment (SEIA) reports. If the lEE or EIA reveals that the improvement\nworks will result in significant impacts, either during construction or during the\nProject's service life, suitable mitigation measures will be developed and included\nin the Project designs, cost estimates, and contract documentation. If required, the\nEIA report will be prepared in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the\nEnvironmental Impacts of Infrastructure Projects and Environmental Assessment\nRequirements and Environmental Review Procedures (March 1993). If an EIA is\nrequired, an SEIA in a format acceptable to the Bank and the governments will be\nprepared.\n(ii) Identify the social impacts that may arise from the improvement works and, if these\nare significant, prepare an appropriate resettlement and rehabilitation action plan in\naccordance with Government guidelines and procedures and the Bank's\nGuidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations and the\nrelated Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects, and estimate\nall costs related to the implementation of the plan. Reference will also be made to\nTA No 1997-VIE: Second Road Improvement Project, for $2.1 miffion, approved on 29 November 1993.\n-.\t \"\"'\"l\"", "10\nAppendix 1, page 5\nthe President of the Bank's Instructions of 15 February 1994 on Involuntary\nResettlement and Indigenous Peoples.\n5.\t Cross-border Movement\n6. Since this activity impacts not only on the proposed Project but on the Bank's\noverall subregional initiative, it will continue to be dealt with primarily within the framework of that\ninitiative. However, since it is essential for the success of the proposed Project that movement\nacross the Cambodia-Viet Nam border occurs with as little impediment as possible, the TA will\naddress this matter in detail. The approach developed in this Project will become a model for\naddressing similar issues in other subregional transport projects. The tasks to be undertaken by\nthe consultant under this activity will include the following:\n(i) Carry out a detailed review of the present legislative and administrative and\nprocedural framework within which cross-border movement of people, goods, and\nvehicles operates.\n(ii) Review existing international conventions on transport facilitation, including those\ncited in the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP) resolution 48/11, and examine their relevance in resolving cross-\nborder issues between Cambodia and Viet Nam.\n(iii) Examine how such matters have been addressed between other countries, both\nwithin the region and elsewhere, that share a common border and a relatively free\nmovement across it.\n(iv) Based on items (i) to (iii), initiate discussions with the agencies of both\ngovernments that are concerned with cross-border movements of all types, and\nwork towards developing a common, simplified approach that is acceptable to both.\n(v) Once an approach acceptable to both governments has been developed, assist\nwith the preparation of the necessary legislation and/or regulations and\nagreements that will give it legal force.\nC.\t Implementation\n1.\t Consultant's Inputs\n7. Work schedules and cost estimates for the TA have been prepared assuming the\nfollowing staffing inputs. Consultants may vary the expertise mix to suit their approach to the\nProject without, however, significantly changing the proportions of international and senior\ndomestic inputs. Consultants must also ensure that there is a reasonable balance of domestic\nspecialist inputs from Cambodia and Viet Nam. The following consultant services are required:\n(i) international consultants - about 85 person-months, with broad expertise in\nproject management, transport economics, highway and structural engineering,\nsurveying, hydraulic engineering and hydrology, geotechnical and pavement\nengineering, cost estimating, computer assisted design, environmental and social\nassessments of road projects, civil works procurement, unexploded ordnance\nsurveys, and international law.", "\t\n11\nAppendix 1, page 6\n(ii)\t senior domestic consultants \u2014 about 100 person-months, generally and where\nappropriate with the same range of expertise as the international consultants.\n8. The consultant will provide all technical and administrative support staff required to\nimplement the TA, together with office space, furniture, equipment, computers and computer\nsoftware, transport, etc. The consultant may base the Project team in either or both of the\nterminal cities, at its choice, and will establish a presence in the other city. The consultant may\nalso undertake some of the work in its home office or elsewhere, if it is significantly cost-effective\nto do so. However, since an important objective of the Bank's TA program is enhancing the\ncapacity of domestic institutions, the extent to which design and other work is undertaken outside\nthe countries is to be kept to a reasonable minimum.\n2.\t Executing and Implementing Agencies\n9. The Bank will be the Project Executing Agency. For Viet Nam, the Project\nImplementing Agency will be the Project Management Unit of the My Thuan Bridge Project (PMU-\nMTBP), an agency of the Ministry of Transport. For Cambodia, the Implementing Agency will be\nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport. For day-to-day coordination of the TA, the Bank and\nthe Implementing Agencies will form a Coordinating Committee. The consultant also will be a\nmember of the committee, responsible for logistical arrangements, preparation of agendas and\nminutes, and follow-up action.\n3.\t Implementation Schedule\n10. The feasibility study traffic and economic evaluation reviews, the inland water\ntransport diversion study, and the IEE, are to be completed within eight weeks of the services\ncommencing, and their results are to included in the inception report (see reporting requirements\nbelow). Environmental and social impact analyses, and the resettlement and rehabilitation action\nplan, are to be completed by the sixth month of the services. Detailed engineering, updated\neconomic evaluation, and preparation of contract documentation are to be completed by the tenth\nmonth of the services. For the purpose of proposal preparation, procurement assistance, which\nwill depend to a significant extent on government and Bank approvals, could be completed by\nabout the eighteenth month of the services.\n4.\t Reporting and Documentation Requirements\n11.\t The consultant will prepare the following reports and documents for the IAs and the\nBank, and submit them in the numbers indicated.\n(i) Inception Report.. The report, which will be submitted two months after\ncommencing the services, will be based on the work and staffing schedules agreed\nduring contract negotiations and will highlight problems encountered or anticipated\nand recommend solutions. The report will include the traffic, economic, and inland\nwaterway diversion studies, and the IEE (IAs-10 copies each; the Bank-3 copies).\n(ii) Progress Reports. Brief reports will be submitted monthly, based on the\ninception report implementation and staffing schedules.
