INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) aims to support the Government of Indonesia in \nstrengthening local tax revenue administration and policy at the central and local levels.1 The \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) has a national strategy of increasing the country\u2019s local tax to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) ratio from 1.2% in 2012 to 1.7% in 2015.2 In addition, a concurrent \neffort will be made to increase the ratio of own-source revenue to local budget from 16% in 2012 \nto  22%\u201325%  in  2015.  Urban  local  governments  that  have  the  potential  to  increase  their \nrevenues because of the size of their economy and population will be key to increasing local \nown-source revenue. The TA will also provide knowledge sharing to a select number of local \ngovernments  that  have  weak  capacity  but  the  potential  to  increase  revenue  because  of \nincreased economic activity. The TA is a continuation of ongoing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) support to strengthen governance in local governments, particularly in the area of local \nrevenue administration.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Increasing local government fiscal autonomy. The passing of Law No. 28 Year 2009 \non Local Government Taxes and Retributions provides more autonomy to local governments in \nraising own-source revenues. Local governments can now expand local tax and retribusi (user \nfee) bases, and have the discretion to set their own tax and fee rates. The law is specific with \nregard  to  the  revenue  assignment  and  taxation  power  of  provincial,  municipal  and  district \ngovernments, with more power given to the latter.4 Municipalities and districts are responsible \nfor managing and administering property taxes, which account for the largest share of local \nown-source  revenue.  The  ability  of  local  governments  to  raise  local  own-source  revenue \nthrough  taxes  provides  increased  accountability  to  their  constituents.  The  design  and \nadministration of local revenue systems are crucial in improving the local tax system. The \nimpacts of tax reform have been significant\u2014own-source revenues, as a share of the total \nbudget resources of local governments, have increased significantly, from 18.6% in 2010, to \n19.66% in 2011, and 20.4% in 2012. However, these increases have not been accompanied by \nincreases in (i) the local tax ratio, which was 1.4% of GDP in 2012, a decline from 2.9% in 2011; \nor (ii) local tax per capita, which was about Rp77,000 in 2012.5 The devolution of property taxes \nhas also created some administrative challenges, such as a reduction in the number of payment \nchannels,  inadequate  property  valuation  capabilities,  an  outdated  fiscal  cadastre,  and \ninaccurate arrears data. \n \n3.  Increasing  local  government  accountability  and  transparency.  Recent  research \nsupports the view that taxation policy and administration are critical for improving governance \nand thus improved transparency. Taxation forms the basis of accountability and transparency \nrelationships\u2014based on mutual rights and obligations\u2014between the local government and its \nconstituents.  Constituents  that  pay  taxes  have  a  right  to  demand  accountability  and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 October 2014. \n2  The realized figure for collection of total local taxes in 2013 is Rp. 114.5 trillion or 1.3% of GDP. \n3  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Local Government Finance and Governance \nReform. Manila (TA 8057-INO, $800,000, approved on 4 April). TA 8057 has reviewed the state of readiness of \nlocal governments in implementing local taxes, conducted pilot study on local tax administration in 6 local \ngovernments, and produced a diagnostic assessment of local tax administration reform for City of Jakarta. \n4  Provincial governments are authorized to collect taxes on motor vehicles, surface water, and cigarettes, while \nmunicipal and/or district governments collect taxes on hotels, restaurants and entertainment centers, billboards, \nstreet  lighting,  nonmetallic  mineral  deposits,  groundwater,  edible  bird\u2019s  nests,  and  property.  The  central \ngovernment retains the authority to collect income taxes, value-added tax, taxes on luxury goods, and property \ntaxes for agriculture, forestry, and mining. \n5  The drop results from local GDP increasing more quickly than local tax revenue. \n ", "2 \n \ntransparency,  and  improved  and  responsive  provision  of  public  services,  with  increased \nconstituent participation. As such local government needs to be more transparent on whether \nthe local taxes are being used to finance expenditures that are responsive to the needs and \npreferences  of  citizens.  The  emergence  of  a  more  accountable  and  transparent  local \ngovernment occurs when the government faces incentives to increase its public budget through \nengagement with constituents, rather than through reliance on central government transfers \nand/or narrow natural resource rents. A property tax is an excellent example of a tax that \npromotes public participation and greater local government accountability\u2014it is direct, highly \nvisible, substantial, and affects a large proportion of the constituency. \n \n4.  Weak  tax  compliance.  Lessons  from  diagnostic  work  in  Jakarta  indicate  that  the \nproperty tax compliance rate in 2013, in terms of the number of tax bills issued, was only 55%, \nalthough Jakarta collected almost 80% of the total property tax amount billed. Only about 41% \nof the registered hotel, restaurant, and entertainment industry taxpayers actively remit sales tax \nevery month. The existing fiscal cadastre is outdated, with much missing data, and does not \nreflect the current situation. Information technology capabilities are substandard and the core \ntax system is fragmented, with separate database and business processes for each tax type. \nThe tax-type organizational structure also does not conform to international good practices. \nTaxpayer services are not standardized across tax offices and payment channels remain limited \nfor certain tax types. \n \n5.  Need for increased capacity. As local governments are given more responsibility for \nmanaging their fiscal affairs, there is a pressing need to significantly and rapidly increase the \ntechnical, administrative, and fiscal policy analysis and revenue mobilization capacity of local \npublic financial officers, especially in light of the enormous revenue potential. Local government \nfinancial  officers  currently  have  limited  capacity  to  analyze  local  revenue  potential  and \nimplement effective revenue administration, particularly with regard to the recently devolved \nproperty tax. Inappropriate tax policy and/or ineffective administration leads to low voluntary \ncompliance and low revenue yields. Low voluntary compliance is exacerbated by local tax \nregulations that impose a heavy burden or high compliance costs, and contributes to low \nrevenue yields, which in turn affect public service delivery, weaken downward accountability, \ncreate opportunities for rent-seeking activities, and increase reliance on central government \ntransfers. The introduction of e-tax services (electronic registration, filing, payment, and other \ninquiries) being proposed under this TA will reduce direct contact between taxpayers and tax \nofficials, and thus strengthen governance, and decrease response time and compliance costs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact will be increased local own-source revenues and tax compliance rates in \nIndonesia. The outcome will be improved tax administration and policymaking capacity of local \ngovernments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA will work at both central and local levels. At the central level, the TA will focus on \nimproving the main regulatory framework on local revenue mobilization and building up the \ncapacity of the Directorate General Fiscal Balance (DGFB) of MOF in overseeing the fiscal \ndecentralization. On the regulatory aspect, the TA will review the effectiveness of the current \ndevolution of local taxes and also explore how to incentivize local governments to increase local \ntaxes. Such incentives can be imbedded in the current intergovernmental transfer system. The\n ", "3 \n \ncapacity building for DGFB will focus on strengthening their knowledge on local government tax \npolicy and revenue administration, through a series of analytical  studies. The TA will also \nupgrade the capacity of DGFB staff through field visits, training seminars and workshops in local \nrevenue administration, aimed at finding cost-effective and politically acceptable approaches \nand establishing sustainable central support for efficient and equitable revenue administration in \nthe selected LGs. The inputs of local governments will also be critical in ensuring that the \ncapacity building and reform efforts can be well implemented. \n \n8.  At the local level the TA will focus on mobilizing local tax revenues and supporting \ninstitutional  and  systems  transformation  to  more  modern,  efficient  and  credible  revenue \nadministration in the selected LGs: provincial governments of Jakarta and West Java; and the \ncity of Bandung (West Java). The TA will also work with other reform-minded cities such as \nBalikpapan (East Kalimantan), Makassar (South Sulawesi), Surakarta (Central Java), and the \ndistrict of Badung (Bali) in their local tax reform but not as extensively as in the first three local \ngovernments. The local governments were selected on the basis of management commitment \nto tax reform, tax revenue potential, fiscal and staff capacity, and location. DGFB would like the \nselected local governments to become centers of excellence on local revenue administration; \nthey can then share knowledge, solutions, and lessons with other local governments. A key \nobjective is to increase the quality of services provided by the local tax unit and thus promote \nvoluntary compliance. \n \n9.  Output 1: Harmonization and delineation of responsibilities between the central \nand local governments on tax policy and administration. The TA will assist the central \ngovernment by conducting assessments of various aspects of the central government\u2019s policies \nregarding local government tax policy and revenue administration, looking at both central and \nlocal levels. The key engagement will be with the government\u2019s tripartite team\u2014comprising \nDGFB, the Directorate General Tax of MOF, and Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)\u2014on Law No. \n28, and conducting joint studies and preparing academic papers to review the effectiveness of \nthe law as well as its implementing regulations. The TA team will work closely with DGFB on \nevaluating the impact and implications of Law No. 28/2009 on the intergovernmental transfer \nsystem,  and  specifically  examining  the  incentive  effects  of  the  general  specific  allocation \ntransfer (or block grant transfer to local governments) on local revenue mobilization. The TA will \nalso include analytical work on the devolution of property tax on mining, forestry and plantation \nsectors,  tax  object  valuation  models,  and  local  business  tax  and  income  tax  surcharges. \nTraining seminars and focus group discussions will be held to disseminate the lessons to DGFB \nstaff. \n \n10.  Output 2: Mobilization of local tax revenues and broadening of tax bases. The TA \nwill  support  the  comprehensive  updating  of  the  fiscal  cadastre  in  the  selected  local \ngovernments, property revaluation, and collection of tax arrears. Improving the fiscal cadastre is \na key to measuring the true potential of property taxes. In most cases, local governments in \nIndonesia, including those selected for pilot projects, have been unable to improve their fiscal \ncadastre. The effect has been low property tax potential, which impacts local revenue forecasts. \nFiscal cadastre improvement would require cooperation from a third party to ensure the map is \nas up-to-date as possible. The third party envisioned under the TA is the Information Geospatial \nAgency.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Institutional  transformation  of  local  tax  administration.  The  TA  will \nperform a revenue administration diagnostic analysis for the selected local governments on tax \nrevenue  performance  and  administrative  capabilities  as  well  as  tax  gaps  and  revenue \nadministration  conduct  baseline  and  evaluation  taxpayer  satisfaction  surveys,  produce \n ", "4 \n \nacademic  papers  on  tax  revenue  reorganization,  develop  human  resource  management \nstrengthening  strategies  for  local  revenue  administrations,  produce  standard  operating \nprocedures for core tax functions and deliver training on institutional transformation. The TA \nenvisions assessing the institutional reform proposed under the TA through comparison with \ninternational  good  practice  on  tax  administration,  such  as  the  establishment  of  tax \nadministration based on function rather than tax type, and formation of an internal compliance \nsection to improve internal control capacity and governance. \n \n12.  Output 4: Revenue system development and implementation. The TA will focus on \ndeveloping and implementing an integrated centralized core tax  administration system and \nrelated documentation and user\u2019s manual, producing a medium-term IT blueprint, producing \nsystems analysis and design documents, and introducing an automated system for taxpayer \nservices accessible on mobile devices (e-tax services). Services that are envisioned to be \nprovided are integrated connectivity between central and branch office, an incorporated backup \nsystem, integrated single taxpayer identification through integrated recording, automated audit \nselection, introduction of return filing with automated error correction, utilization of external \ninformation  and  third  party  data,  and  introduction  of  inter-tax  type  data  checking.  System \nimplementation will be assisted through development of a project operations manual and project \nmanagement tools for transformation of revenue administration systems.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,250,000, of which $5,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Government  of  Switzerland  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  of \nIndonesia  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nworkshop and consultation support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, and is expected to commence in March 2015 \nand  end  in  February  2018.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  DGFB  of  MOF,  which  is \nresponsible for local revenue policies and fiscal decentralization. The implementing agencies \nwill include the Directorate of Local Taxes of DGFB, the provincial governments of Jakarta and \nWest Java; the cities of Balikpapan (East Kalimantan), Bandung (West Java), and Makassar \n(South Sulawesi); and the district of Badung (Bali).  \n \n15.  For  interagency  coordination  and  overall  policy  guidance,  the  project  will  form  an \nadvisory committee, headed by the DGFB of MOF, which will include representatives from the \nDirectorate General of Regional Finance of MOHA, the Directorate General of Tax of MOF, ADB, \nand the Government of Switzerland. DGFB is responsible for setting up policy direction for fiscal \ndecentralization;  the  Directorate  General  of  Regional  Finance  of  MOHA  is  responsible  for \nimplementation of the regional financial management information system in local governments; \nand the Directorate General of Tax of MOF is responsible for devolution of property tax.  \n \n16.  The TA plans to engage 420 person-months of consulting services (48 person-months of \ninternational and 372 person-months of national services) through a mix of individuals and firms. \nThree types of consultants will be selected by ADB: (i) a team comprising one international and \nseven national tax revenue administration modernization advisors that will be selected using \nquality- and cost-based selection at a ratio of 80:20, and a full technical proposal; (ii) three \nspecialized  firms  for  the  tax  information  technology  system,  which  will  use  consultants\u2019 \nqualification selection; and (iii) short-term individual advisors in fiscal decentralization policy, \n ", "5 \n \nbureaucracy reform, and property valuation. The TA will carry out an advance procurement \naction to expedite the recruitment of consultants prior to TA effectiveness. The consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time).6 Any procurement will be done in accordance with the Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursement under the TA will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n17.  The TA assumes (i) that the central government has the will to build local government \ncapacity and to revise intergovernmental transfer policies, which is necessary to give local \ngovernments the incentive to raise their own revenues; and (ii) that local governments have the \ncommitment and willingness to execute actions to tap potential revenues. The leadership of \nDGFB of MOF has shown strong commitment for reform and to support local governments in \nthe implementation and improvement of the property tax system. In securing a commitment from \nlocal  government  for  local  tax  reform,  during  its  initial  phase  the  TA  will  work  with  local \ngovernments that have shown strong leadership and political will for reform by strengthening the \ninstitutional capacity of their revenue administration, and mobilizing revenues. Each selected \nlocal  government  will  be  supported  by  a  dedicated TA team  to  ensure  rapid response to \ntechnical support needs. Further, the proposed solutions under the TA will be under the existing \nlegal framework. The executing agency supported by the ADB TA team will look for approaches \nto  increase  cooperation  with  local  universities  or  academic  institutions  (e.g.,  through \nmemorandums  of  understanding  between  MOF  and  the  local  universities),  and  thereby \nstrengthen support for local governments. \n \nE.  Governance  \n \n18.  MOF\u2019s  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  to  carry  out  the  project  is \nadequate. In June 2014, MOF implemented an integrated financial management system that \naims to make the budget execution process more efficient, economical, effective, transparent, \nand  accountable.7 ADB  has  provided  ongoing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  and \ncontrols,  particularly  on  public  procurement.  As  a  result  of  the  government\u2019s  continuing \ncommitment to reducing corruption, the capacity of the Corruption Eradication Commission has \nimproved markedly.8 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n19.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 to the Government of Indonesia to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Switzerland for Tax Revenue Administration \nModernization and Policy Improvement in Local Governments. \n                                                \n6  To improve the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s limited staff resources and streamlined TA administration, the user unit will \nexplore the use of lump-sum, fixed cost out-of-pocket expense contracts. \n7  The prevailing regulation on the integrated financial management system is the Ministry of Finance Regulation \n(PMK) No. 154/PMK.05/2014. \n8  From 2003 to 2012, the Corruption Eradication Commission has handled 223 high-profile cases involving top \ngovernment officials; of these 169 cases have been processed in court.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and Indicators with  and Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nLocal own-source  By 2020:    Public finance reforms \nrevenues and tax  National local tax ratio is increased to 1.7% of  Ministry of  continue to be one of the \ncompliance rates  GDP (baseline in 2012 is 1.2% of GDP)  Finance  main reforms at the \nincreased in  central and local levels. \nIndonesia   \nRisk \nCentral and local political \npressure to halt the \npublic finance reform \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved tax  By 2018:    Reform-minded local \nadministration and  Property tax revenue compliance rate  Fiscal cadastre of  leaders lead public \npolicymaking  increased by 5\u201310 percentage points at each  each selected  finance reform at local \ncapacity of local  selected local government (baseline 65%\u2013 local government  level. \ngovernments  85% in 2013)     \n    Risk \nTotal local taxes  increased by 25% (baseline  Ministry of  Slow implementation of \nRp. 114.5 trillion in 2013)   Finance  central government \n    decentralization policies \nTax revenue of provincial governments of   \nJakarta and West Java; the cities of  Local government \nBalikpapan (East Kalimantan), Bandung  budget documents \n(West Java), Makassar (South Sulawesi), \nSurakarta (Central Java), and district of \nBadung (Bali) are doubled from 2013 levels  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
