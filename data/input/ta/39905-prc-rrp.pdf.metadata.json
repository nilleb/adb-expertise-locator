I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nequity investment of up to US$25 million equivalent in China Gas Holdings Limited (CGH); (ii) a \nproposed loan of up to US$50 million equivalent, of which up to 50% will be in US dollars and \nthe balance in CNY; and (iii) a proposed loan under the complementary financing scheme of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) of up to US$75 million for the Municipal Gas Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \n2.  The extensive use of coal in the PRC has led to serious local, regional, and global \nenvironmental problems, such as severe air pollution, acid rain, and greenhouse gas emissions. \nA report released in 1998 by the World Health Organization notes that of the 10 most polluted \ncities in the world, seven are in the PRC. Sulfur dioxide and particulates produced through coal \ncombustion are two major air pollutants, resulting in the formation of acid rain, which now falls \non about 30% of the PRC's total landmass. Industrial boilers and furnaces consume almost half \nof the PRC's coal and are the largest single point sources of urban air pollution.  \n \n3.  To  minimize  environmental  degradation,  the  Government  is  working  to  reduce  coal \nconsumption  and  increase  usage  of  cleaner  fuels  such  as  natural  gas,  which  currently \nrepresents  less  than  3%  of  the  energy  mix  in  the  country.  While  the  Government  has \nrestructured upstream oil- and gas-producing companies, the lag of reforms in the downstream \nsector continues to be a bottleneck to greater expansion of natural gas distribution services. \nLocal gas distribution companies, which would play a key role in a competitive gas market, \nremained controlled by the municipal government or state-owned enterprises. To alleviate this \nbottleneck, the Government recently stepped up efforts to encourage private sector participation \nin the downstream gas distribution market by relaxing policy constraints on foreign ownership in \nmunicipal distribution companies.  \n \n4.  The core business of CGH is twofold: (i) the investment, operation, and management of \nmunicipal natural gas pipeline infrastructure; and (ii) the sale and distribution of piped and \ncompressed natural gas in municipalities in the PRC. As of March 2006, CGH had developed \nand was operating 48 municipal natural gas distribution companies across eleven provinces \n(autonomous regions and directly-administered cities), including Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, \nHebei,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Jiangsu,  Liaoning,  Shaanxi,  Zhejiang  provinces,  and  Chongqing. \nAlthough more than 800,000 households are currently being connected and served by CGH, \nCGH\u2019s  total  customer  base  is  estimated  to  exceed  4  million,  five  times  the  number  of \nhouseholds currently connected. To meet the growing demand for natural gas in the PRC, CGH \nhas to carry out massive capital investments in the next several years.   \n \nA.  The Natural Gas Sector  \n \n1.  Demand and Supply \n \n5.  Historically, natural gas has constituted a small proportion of the overall energy balance \nin the PRC. Natural gas utilization was heavily concentrated in fertilizer production to support \nagricultural production, with little or no natural gas utilized for power generation. Consequently, \nnatural gas demand between 1975 and 1990 remained relatively stable. Demand growth has \naccelerated since 1999, exceeding 10% annually, except in 2002, following rapid economic \nexpansion. Natural gas consumption increased by 1.7 times in the 1990s as the economy grew. ", "  4\nConsumption reached approximately 47 billion cubic meters (bcm) per annum by 2005, and is \nestimated  to  more  than  double  by  2010.  The  Energy  Research  Institute  of  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission estimates that natural gas demand in the PRC will be \napproximately  120  bcm  in  2010  and  200  bcm  in  2020,  or  2.5  and  4.2  times  the  2005 \nconsumption.  \n \n6.  Total domestic natural gas supply is projected to be approximately 80 bcm in 2010 and \n110 bcm per annum in 2020. This indicates a growth rate of 7.5%, while the annual growth rate \nfor natural gas demand is estimated to be 10.8% for the same period. The demand and supply \ngap is expected to be met by imports, which will be achieved via international pipelines and \nliquefied natural gas.  \n \n7.  By the end of 2000, the total length of the urban gas distribution pipeline was 89,458 km. \nIt comprised 33,655 km for natural gas, 48,384 km for coal gas, and 7,419 km for liquefied \npetroleum gas. According to the Ministry of Construction, the gas distribution subsector supplied \n8.2 bcm of natural gas, 15.2 bcm of manufactured coal gas, and 10.5 million tons of liquefied \npetroleum gas in 2000 when only about 15 large cities were supplied with natural gas. The \nnumber of cities using natural gas increased to over 140 in 2005 and is expected to increase to \n270 by 2010. Municipal natural gas distribution will consume approximately 40 bcm of natural \ngas, representing about 35% of the total natural gas consumption in the PRC. Downstream \ndevelopment  of  natural  gas  markets  is  estimated  to  require  significant  capital  investment: \nCNY74.8 billion (US$9.3 billion) during 2005\u20132010. The natural gas sector is described in \nAppendix 1. \n \n2.  Sector Policies and Regulations \n \n8.  The PRC\u2019s natural gas industry was vertically integrated under government mandate \nuntil  the  late  1990s,  with  state-owned  enterprises  responsible  for  exploration,  production, \ntransportation, and marketing activities. The industry was governed by rationing, price floors, \nand ceilings, which were arguably not reflective of true production capability. Recently, the \nGovernment has taken steps to reform and liberalize the gas market; key among these include \n(i) lifting  restrictions  on  natural  gas  usage  for  the  fertilizer  subsector  and  accelerating  the \npenetration of natural gas into both the power generation and residential subsectors, and (ii) \nopening up the downstream gas market to foreign and private investors. \n \n9.  Promotion of natural gas usage can be attributed to the Government\u2019s focus on (i) \neconomic development, (ii) energy security, and (iii) environmental protection. The 11th Five-\nYear Plan (2006\u20132010), in relation to the energy industry, emphasizes the importance of a \ndiversified energy base to ensure optimization of the energy mix and obtaining as much energy \nsecurity as possible for the PRC. The abundance of domestic natural gas reserves is seen as a \ngreat opportunity to obtain some flexibility in its dependency on external sources of energy.  \n \n10.  To encourage the increased use of natural gas in the overall energy mix, the expansion \nof natural gas exploration and development of the transportation network are indispensable to \nimprove access to natural gas. To increase the supply, encouraging regulations are in place for \n(i) the construction of the natural gas trunk pipe network and supporting facilities; and (ii) the \nrelaxation  and  diversification  of  downstream  distribution  network  ownership,  focusing  in \nparticular on private sector ownership. This will also be in line with the national policy to develop \nthe western part of the PRC, which has natural gas reserves to drive forward the much-needed \neconomic development of the region.  \n ", "5 \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n  1.  Country Strategy \n \n11.  The  ADB  country  strategy  for  the  PRC1  is  based  on  four  development  objectives: \n(i) promotion of equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) development of better and more efficient \nmarkets, (iii) environment improvements, and (iv) promotion of regional cooperation. This is \nconsistent  with  priorities  highlighted  in  the  ADB  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  (2006\u20132008), \nincluding catalyzing investment to improve the investment climate, expanding private sector \noperations,  and  managing  the  environment.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  focuses  on  reducing  the \ninequality between the coastal and interior provinces, and the income gap between the urban \nand rural populations. The Government accords high priority to expediting the PRC\u2019s transition \nto a market economy as the basis for growth and job creation, which require better and more \nefficient markets for the private sector.  \n \n12.  To support Government initiatives to employ the private sector as the driving force for \nthe country\u2019s long-term economic growth and job creation, ADB plans to substantially increase \nits private sector operations in the PRC focusing on the infrastructure and energy sectors, the \nfinancial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and energy sectors, \nADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to \nencourage private sector participation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate \ngovernance.  \n \n  2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy supports the following operational priorities (i) poverty \nreduction by, among other ways, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth \nand increasing the poor\u2019s access to energy, particularly in rural areas; (ii) promotion of private \nsector involvement by restructuring the energy sector, and creating an enabling environment for \nthe  private  sector;  (iii)  addressing  regional  and  global  environment  impacts  by  supporting \nmeasures to address acid rain problems and use of clean energy; and (iv) promotion of regional \ncooperation. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  ADB Project \n \n14.  The Project, which allows for both loan and equity participation by ADB, will support \nCGH\u2019s investment plan to fund a series of new natural gas distribution infrastructure projects in \nmunicipalities. The Project aims to develop natural gas distribution infrastructure and address \nfinancial  constraints  faced  by  municipalities,  two  key  obstacles  to  natural  gas  market \ndevelopment in the PRC. \n \nB.  China Gas Holdings Limited  \n \n15.  Established in 1995, CGH is a downstream natural gas distribution company, supplying \nresidential, industrial, and commercial customers in municipalities.  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. ", "  6\n1.  Shareholders \n \n16.  CGH is a majority publicly owned company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The \nshareholding was recently expanded to include Gas Authority of India Limited and Oman Oil \nCompany, both of which have significant experience in gas distribution and technical expertise \nin their respective countries.  \n \n2.  Operations \n \n17.  As  of  March  2006,  CGH  has  obtained  concession  rights  for  48  piped  natural  gas \nprojects.  CGH  is  serving  residential,  industrial  and  commercial  customers  in  11  provinces \n(autonomous regions and directly-administered cities),  including Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, \nHebei, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Zhejiang provinces, and Chongqing.  \n \n18.  CGH\u2019s  board  comprises  11  directors:  five  executive  directors,  three  nonexecutive \ndirectors, and three independent nonexecutive directors.  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Environment, Safety, and Health \n \n19.  The nature of municipal natural gas distribution projects entails construction of facilities \nat the gateway station and laying small gas pipes. The design and operation of the gateway \nstation and gas distribution system are required by laws to strictly follow safety standards and \npractices that are well established by professional institutions in the gas industry. The controlling \nauthorities also periodically monitor safety aspects. The construction of facilities at the gateway \nstation and pipe laying are minor civil works with minor environmental disturbances that can be \nreadily  minimized  by  implementing  well-established  mitigation  measures  prescribed  in \nconstruction contracts. Operations of the gateway station do not create a significant amount of \nwaste. Only a small volume of natural gas is occasionally vented and flared for a short duration \nduring routine maintenance of valves, filters, and meters. The flaring of this small volume of \nnatural gas over a short period is unlikely to have significant impacts on ambient air quality.  \n \n20.  CGH has a corporate policy on health, safety, and environment. It does not have an \nexplicit  social  policy  since  its  downstream  natural  gas  business  does  not  relate  to  any \noutstanding social issues. CGH abides by national and provincial environmental laws. It duly \nconducts environmental impact assessments for all of its projects and applies for all permits \nrequired in implementing the projects and operating project facilities. \n \n21.  The Project is classified as environment category FI. To comply with ADB safeguards, \nCGH  will  set  up  an  environmental  management  system  for  new  projects,  including \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures for potential investments that are acceptable \nto ADB. ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines and policies and the PRC\u2019s environmental laws and \nregulations will be complied with, and implementation of environmental mitigation measures will \nbe  monitored  in  collaboration  with  municipal  environmental  protection  bureaus.  Such \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation and annual reports on environmental monitoring. CGH will confirm to ADB \nperiodically its compliance with environmental requirements of ADB and the PRC, and report to \nADB.  \n \n2.  Resettlement ", "7 \n \n22.  The Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B/C and indigenous \npeoples category C. For downstream natural gas distribution sector projects, land acquisition \nand  relocation  of  inhabitants  are  limited  and  if  needed,  are  carried  out  by  the  municipal \ngovernments before the concessions are open for competition. CGH thus has a limited role in \nland acquisition and relocation. For new concessions, CGH will undertake due diligence to \nensure no acquisition of rights to land or displacement of people or enterprises. In the event of \ninvoluntary resettlement as a result of land acquisition by project companies, CGH, together \nwith the relevant joint venture, will ensure that all acquisition and resettlement activities are \nundertaken in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement2 \nand the agreed resettlement framework.  \n \n3.  Development Impact \n \n23.  The Project is designed to promote economic growth and environmental improvement by \nincreasing the supply of clean energy and financing to municipalities. Specifically, the Project \nwill  (i)  prevent  further  environmental  degradation  by  supporting  Government  efforts  to \nencourage  the  use  of  cleaner  fuels  in  urban  areas,  and  expand  downstream  natural  gas \ndistribution through private sector participation; (ii) provide flexibility in energy supply for the \nPRC by taking advantage of the PRC\u2019s abundant natural gas reserves, which are largely \nunderdeveloped and underutilized; (iii) help lower overall exposure to the volatility of oil prices \nand contribute to the stability of the economy; (iv) help build a nascent natural gas distribution \nmarket by providing international best practices to the PRC\u2019s downstream distribution market, \nthus  setting  standards  for  other  companies  to  follow  as  the  market  matures;  and  (v) \ndemonstrate social responsibility in local municipalities through the enforcement of provincial \npolicies that stipulate the preferential supply of natural gas to households first, prior to the \ndevelopment of the industrial customer base. \n \n4.  Development Effectiveness \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and Operations Evaluation Department \nare formulating guidelines for implementing the Good Practice Standards for Evaluation of \nPrivate Sector Investment Operations, which were prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation \nGroup of the multilateral development banks. These standards cover the roles of the Operations \nEvaluation Department and Private Sector Operations Department, the evaluation dimensions \nfor private sector operations, the nature of annual reporting, and dissemination of reports and \nlessons. According to the standards, the three principal dimensions for private sector evaluation \nare development outcome (encompassing project performance, the project\u2019s contribution to \neconomic  sustainability,  and  its  contribution  to  private  sector  development),  investment \nprofitability of the project intervention to the institution itself (i.e., specific returns on the loan, \nguarantee, or equity investment), and operational effectiveness measured and assessed on an \noverall department level. \n \n25.  The  Project  was  assessed  and  described  from  the  perspectives  of  development \neffectiveness and project framework in terms of its specific performance, and the Project\u2019s \ncontribution to both economic sustainability and private sector development. The Project is \ndeemed to be developmentally effective and its performance measurable. A brief summary \ndiscussion follows on each of these parameters. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. ", "  8\na.  Project Performance \n \n26.  The  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational and financial objectives. Essentially, effectiveness will be measured against how \nsuccessfully the Project attracts private sector capital (both debt and equity), how the Project \nsecures municipal natural gas distribution concessions, how the Project develops and expands \nmunicipal natural gas distribution networks, and how much natural gas the Project supplies to \nconsumers  and  industries.  The  Project  will  be  also  measured  by  financial  profitability  and \nsustainability through timely debt repayment capacity and equity returns. \n   \nb.  Economic Sustainability \n \n27.  The Project will be assessed, from an economic sustainability perspective, on its ability \nto develop and implement municipal natural gas distribution networks, supply municipal natural \ngas to consumers and industries, and contribute to environmental improvements and economic \ngrowth. Additional employment created as a result of project implementation will be taken into \naccount. The Project\u2019s successful implementation also impacts the promotion of downstream \nnatural gas sector reform. \n   \nc.  Private Sector Development \n \n28.  The Project will be assessed and measured on how it contributes to private sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment is on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial viability, \nand its demonstrative and catalytic effect on future private sector developments in the natural \ngas distribution sector itself and the economy as a whole. \n \n29.  The Project was not specifically assessed from an investment profitability point of view, \nas a profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar loans \nand equity investments. Similarly, the Project was not assessed and measured against overall \noperational effectiveness, as this is a departmental consideration.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Equity Investment \n \n30.  The proposed equity investment is to subscribe for ordinary shares in CGH at a cost of \nup to US$25 million.  The proposed ADB equity investment constitutes a critical and integral \npart of ADB assistance for CGH and the Project. ADB will be entitled to nominate a person to be \nappointed as a nonexecutive director on the CGH board throughout the period that ADB holds \nthe shares. \n \nB.  Loans \n \n31.  The proposed direct loan is for up to US$50 million equivalent: 50% will be lent in US \ndollars and the balance in CNY. A proposed complementary loan is for up to US$75 million \nunder ADB\u2019s complementary financing scheme will be lend in US dollars.  \n \nC.  Justification \n ", "9 \n32.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified on the basis of its development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It supports the Government\u2019s development plans and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies, and provides the value added of ADB participation in the Project: \n \n(i)  The Project will provide access to a clean, reliable, and long-term energy \nsource to the people in municipalities where adequate municipal natural gas \ninfrastructure is lacking and demand is currently not fully met.  \n \n(ii)  The Project will contribute to the PRC\u2019s efforts to promote the use of natural \ngas  and  improve  the  environment.  The  Project  will  have  a  significant \ndevelopment impact by helping reduce air pollution by substituting natural \ngas for coal energy. The reduction of particulates and sulfur dioxide from \nhouseholds and small industries will have the most beneficial impact on the \nurban  population,  in  particular  the  urban  poor,  who  suffer  severely  from \nindoor and outdoor air pollution.  \n \n(iii)  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private \nsector participation in the municipal natural gas distribution sector, given the \nsubstantial investment required in expanding the natural gas pipeline network \nand the limited self-financing capacity of the municipalities. The Project is \nexpected to free up municipal governments\u2019 resources from investments in \nnatural gas distribution to other types of critical expenditures related to social \nconcerns and health.  \n \n(iv)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies, which \nemphasize supporting energy infrastructure development with private sector \nparticipation and environmentally clean technology. It also supports ADB\u2019s \nthematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector  development, \ngood governance, and environmental protection. The Project contributes to \nthe  promotion  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  in  the  energy  sector  by \n(a) providing innovation in investment priorities through funding of municipal \nnatural  gas  distribution,  (b)  supplying  clean  energy  where  environmental \ndegradation is serious, and (c) enhancing access to clean energy for urban \nand peripheral residents. \n \n(v)  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC, \nwhich have focused on the infrastructure and energy sectors, financial sector, \nand environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and energy sectors, \nADB prioritizes pioneering participation, enhancing management expertise, \nand improving corporate governance. This Project will provide highly skilled \nemployment and know-how transfer opportunity to the local community.  \n \nD.  Anticorruption, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n \n33.  CGH  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  anticorruption3  and  combating  of  money \nlaundering and financing of terrorism.4 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require CGH to institute, maintain, and comply with \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1998.

", "  10\ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The investment documentation \nbetween ADB and CGH will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments and lending operations in the private sector is in effect between the \nGovernment and ADB. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development \nBank (the Articles of Agreement), the Government will be requested to confirm that it has no \nobjection to the proposed assistance to the Project. No funding will be disbursed until ADB \nreceives such confirmation.

The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is the world\u2019s second largest energy producer \nand  consumer  after  the  United  States.  Coal  has  historically  been  the  fuel  of  choice,  with \nabundant reserves located throughout the country. Many power stations are coal-fired, and coal \nis used for domestic cooking and heating.  \n \n2.  In 2004, coal remained the largest source of energy, comprising approximately 66% of \nthe total energy mix. Oil and petroleum products constituted 23%; other energy sources, such \nas hydro and other renewable accounting for 8%; and gas for 3%. \n \n3.  Natural gas usage in the PRC is set to grow rapidly as natural gas is (i) cleaner than \nmost fuels, (ii) economic, and (iii) domestically abundant. The introduction of natural gas into the \npower and nonpower sectors will significantly reduce emissions of particulates, sulfur dioxide \n(SO ), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO ).The price of natural gas is lower than \n2 2\nmost other forms of fuel on a heat content-adjusted basis. For example, it is approximately 34\u2013\n88% lower than coal gas, approximately 38\u201352% cheaper than liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), \nand approximately 63\u201380% lower than electricity.  \n \n4.  The PRC has abundant natural gas reserves, estimated at approximately 2.35 trillion \ncubic meters (tcm) proven natural gas reserves in 2005.5 The Government estimates total \nreserves of natural gas at approximately 38 tcm, of which 78.6% are onshore and 21.4% \noffshore. Onshore natural gas reserves are mainly concentrated in the middle and western \nregions of the PRC such as Chongqing, Gansu, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Offshore \nnatural gas reserves are mainly concentrated near the South China Sea. Onshore domestic gas \nproduction is concentrated in the western region, and undertaken by PetroChina and China \nPetroleum  & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec). Offshore  production is undertaken by  China \nNational Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).  \n \nGas Demand \n5.  Historically, natural gas has constituted a small proportion of the overall energy balance \nin  the  PRC.  Gas  utilization  was  heavily  concentrated  in  fertilizer  production  to  support \nagricultural production, with little or no gas utilized for power generation. Consequently, gas \ndemand between 1975 and 1990 remained relatively stable. Since 1990, gas demand increased \nas the economy grew. Gas consumption increased by 1.7 times in the 1990s. Demand growth \nhas accelerated since 1999, exceeding 10% annually except in 2002 following rapid economic \nexpansion. However, gas remains a small percentage of the energy mix.

The PRC\u2019s growing economy and environmental concerns have been key drivers for the \nincreasing use of gas. By 2005, gas consumption had grown to approximately 47 billion cubic \nmeters (bcm) per annum; this is forecast to more than double by 2010. Demand will continue to \ngrow for the foreseeable future, with estimates, by the Energy Research Institute of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, for natural gas demand to be approximately 120 bcm in \n2010 and 200 bcm in 2020, or 2.5 and 4.2 times the 2005 consumption.  \n \n7.  Forecasts  of  gas  demand  are  subject  to  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty,  as  gas \nconsumption depends heavily on the successful construction of trunk pipelines, and the rate of \ngas penetration in the power and nonpower sectors, especially the rate of conversion of existing \nmanufactured gas distribution and consumption facilities. However, all sources agree that strong \ngrowth in demand will be felt for natural gas in power generation and residential uses. Figure \nA2.2 presents a breakdown of demand projections by sector prepared by PetroChina. \n \n  Figure A2.2: Gas Demand Projections in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n \n250 \n200 \n \nCity gas distribution\nm/a 150   \nc Industry fuel\nb\n100 \n \nChemical\n50 \n \nPower generation\n0 \n2005  2010 2015 2020\nbcm/a = billion cubic meter per annum. \nSource: PetroChina. \n ", "16  Appendix 1      \n \nGas Supply \n8.  The Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission \nprojects total domestic gas supply to be approximately 80 bcm per annum in 2010 and 110 bcm \nin 2020. This indicates a growth rate of 7.5%, while the annual growth rate for natural gas \ndemand is estimated to be 10.8% for the same period (Figure A2.3). The demand and supply \ngap is expected to be met by imports, which will be achieved via international pipelines and \nliquefied natural gas (LNG).  \n \n \nFigure A2.3: Gas Demand and Production (2000\u20132020) \ny  Demand\nm/\nc Production\nb\n                    bcm/y = billion cubic meter per year.  \n  Source: National Development and Reform Commission. \n \n \n \n9.  Some estimates suggest that up to one third of the PRC\u2019s future gas requirements will \nbe met by imports, which will be achieved via pipelines and LNG. Several possible pipeline \nprojects are being considered; the largest is the pipeline project linking the natural gas reserves \nin Siberia of the Russian Federation to the PRC. Other supply points include offshore fields \neither under development or already operating, as well as imported LNG. LNG will be used \nprimarily  in  the  PRC's  southeastern  coastal  regions,  with  possible  later  expansion  in  the \nnortheast. Guangdong LNG is the most advanced of all the LNG projects in the PRC under \nconsideration, expected to begin operations in 2006.  \n \nGas Distribution  \n10.  By the end of 2000, the total length of urban gas distribution pipelines was 89,458 km, \ncomprising natural gas pipelines (33,655 km), coal gas pipelines (48,384 km), and aerated LPG \npipelines  (7,419  km).  Developments  in  downstream  natural  gas  operations  have  mainly \ncentered along the axes of the trunk pipelines such as the West\u2013East and Sichuan\u2013East \ntransmission pipelines. This pattern is expected to continue as new fields and new transmission \ninfrastructure are developed. \n \n11.  According to the Ministry of Construction, the gas distribution subsector supplied 8.2 \nbcm of natural gas, 15.2 bcm of manufactured coal gas, and 10.5 million tons of LPG in 2000. A \ntotal of 176.3 million people were supplied with gas, accounting for 84% of the country\u2019s urban \n(or nonagricultural) population. Sixty-three percent used LPG, 13% used natural gas, and 23% \nused  coal  gas.  These  data  are  significantly  higher  than  those  provided  by  the  PRC  Gas ", "Appendix 2  17 \nAssociation. According to the latter, all gases had only about 20 million residential customers in \n2000, which corresponds to about 80 million people.  \n \n12.  In 2000, only about 15 large cities and some small ones were supplied with natural gas. \nIn 2005, 140 cities were supplied with natural gas compared with 60 in 2003. The number of \ncities using natural gas is expected to increase to 270 in 2010, and city gas distribution will \nconsume 41.4 bcm of natural gas; a volume that will represent about 35% of the total natural \ngas consumption in the country.  \n \n13.  Regardless of the statistics of the current penetration rate for gas usage, the market \npotential  for  natural  gas  in  urban  areas  remains  substantial.  Development  of  downstream \nnatural  gas  markets  is  estimated  to  require  significant  capital  investment\u2014approximately \nCNY74.8 billion (US$9.3 billion) during 2005\u20132010. \n \nPricing \n14.  The National Development and Reform Commission sets wellhead and transmission \nprices,  which  establish  city-gate  prices,  in  turn  forming  the  purchase  price  for  local  gas-\ndistribution companies. The tariffs for downstream gas distribution are set by provincial pricing \nbureaus,  which  also  set  the  connection  fees  charged  to  households  for  first-time  gas \nconnections. \n \n15.  Distribution retail prices are based on cost-plus, reflecting affordability, competitiveness \nof gas versus other fuels, efficiency, and cost of converting manufactured gas-based networks \nto natural gas. The allocation of gas is made according to the producers\u2019 estimates of demand. \nTable A2 is an indicative city-gate price sampling for the PRC: \n \nTable A2: City Gate Prices in the Five Provinces \n \nProvince  CNY/cubic meter \nZhejiang  1.46 \nJiangsu  1.42 \nWuhan  1.09 \nHenan  1.16 \nAnhui  1.23 \n               Source: Credit Lyonnaise Securities Asia. \n \nTechnology \n16.  The technology currently employed in these networks generally dates from the period of \nmanufactured gas, that is, cast iron pipes sealed with oakum and cement. Most of these \nnetworks cannot be used to distribute natural gas without extensive and costly retrofitting. \nWelded steel pipes for natural gas distribution are also in place, but they are rarely cathodic  \nprotected.6 In theory, medium pressure is used, but as the required supply pressure is seldom \navailable, and in many cases the demand is higher than the supply, the network generally \noperates at low pressure. Furthermore, the regulations limit the pressure to 8 bars in the cities \n(except in Shanghai, where some lines are supplied with 15-bar pressure). \n                                                 \n6  Cathodic protection is an electric process by which a very weak current is supplied in the buried steel pipes to \nprevent electro corrosion by a battery effect. ", "18  Appendix 1      \n \n \n17.  Polyethylene  technology  has  been  very  limited  in  the  PRC  but  is  beginning  to  be \ndeveloped in areas with local production of the corresponding materials. When new networks \nwere  laid  in  Beijing,  Chengdu,  Shanghai,  and  Xi\u2019an  specifically  dedicated  to  natural  gas \ndistribution, imported materials were used. However, as the gas distribution industry is growing \nrapidly, local supply sources are being developed to meet the future demand for materials and \nother equipment. \n \nCompetition \n \n18.  Gas distribution is historically carried out by municipal gas companies, under the control \nof municipal governments and the supervision of the Ministry of Construction. Until recently, gas \ncompanies were placed under the direct control of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and \nacted solely as operators. Most of the investment costs were supported by the municipality. Gas \nsales to customers covered the running costs of the company, with a complementary subsidy \nprovided by the municipality when necessary.  \n \n19.  In 2002, the Government lifted restrictions on foreign investments in the distribution \nsector, which resulted in significant interest from both Chinese and foreign investors in acquiring \nconcessions for downstream operations. The emerging opportunities in the downstream gas \nsector has attracted new entrants and encouraged competition. New distribution companies are \nbeing created, with ownership varying among cities, ranging from joint ventures between local \noperators, cooperatives formed by gas company workers, to international joint ventures. The \nmain companies involved, aside from China Gas Holdings Limited, include Hong Kong & China \nGas, Xinao Gas, and Panva Gas Holdings. \n \n20.  Hong Kong & China Gas. Founded in 1882, Hong Kong & China Gas was the first \npublic utility in Hong Kong, China, and currently has over 3,000 km of pipeline network, 1.5 \nmillion customers in the Special Administrative Region, and joint venture projects in 30 cities in \nmainland PRC. \n \n21.  Xinao Gas. Listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange \nin 2001 and on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2002, Xinao Gas has 44 \nprojects in the PRC including Anhui, Beijing, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, \nLiaoning, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia.  \n \n22.  Panva  Gas  Holdings. A supplier of LPG and natural gas in the PRC, Panva Gas \nfounded  40  joint  ventures  covering  11  provinces  including  Anhui,  Guangdong,  Guizhou, \nHeilongjiang, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning Shandong, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Panva Gas \nserves bottled-gas and piped-gas users, selling more than 400,000 tons of LPG per annum. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060906101154+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060905142159+08'00'", "Title": "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Author": "Jimmi Bere", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "Company": "Asian Development Bank, MANIL", "SourceModified": "D:20060905022743"}}
