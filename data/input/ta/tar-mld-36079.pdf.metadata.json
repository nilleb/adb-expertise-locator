The people on the outer islands of the Maldives are heavily disadvantaged in terms of \nincome,  employment  opportunities,  and  access  to  basic  social  services.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is helping the Government of the Maldives improve living conditions \nthrough its comprehensive program for regional development. In connection with the proposed \nRegional Development Phase II sector loan, technical assistance (TA)1 is needed to build \ncapacity to support the regional development program, which will mobilize resources to enhance \nsustainable growth and poverty reduction in the outer atolls.  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited the Maldives from 6-12 October 2003. It reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  goals,  purpose,  output,  methodology,  key \nactivities, implementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  Maldives  consists  of  around  1,190  islands,  with  only  199  suitable  for  human \nhabitation. Of the inhabited islands, 78 have less than 1,000 people, and 118 have a population \nof 1,000 - 4,000. Only four islands have over 4,000 people. Around 80% of the total landmass is \nless than 1 meter above sea level. In 2000 the population was around 270,000 and is growing at \naround 1.9% per annum. About 27% of the population (73,000) lives on the island of Male (2 \nsquare kilometers [km2]), the capital city, making its population density of around 36,500/km2 \none of the highest in the world. \n \n4.  The Maldives has achieved impressive improvements in social indicators over the past \nseveral decades. Despite the positive national figures, however, large disparities in economic \nand social development opportunities exist between Male and the outer atolls, where most of \nthe poor live. The 1998 vulnerability and poverty assessment2 shows that 42% of the population \nhas an income of Rf15 ($1.20) per day or less. More than 90% of households living below the \npoverty line reside on the atolls. The income ratio between Male and the rest of the country is \nabout 2:1. The disparities in access to social infrastructure and services are estimated at 4:1. \n \n5.  This socioeconomic imbalance results in strong rural-to-urban migratory pressure from \nthe subsistence economies of the outer atolls to the public sector-dominated cash economy of \nMale, simultaneously retarding growth in the outer atolls and straining Male\u2019s infrastructure and \nenvironment.  In  recent  years  a  consistent  policy  and  program  approach  to  outer-atoll \ndevelopment has involved increasing local government capacity, investing in atoll infrastructure \nand  social  services,  and  encouraging  cash-generating  enterprises.  The  success  of  these \nprograms has been modest as a result of the following factors: (i) inadequate capacity for in-\ncountry education and a limited private sector have caused a large skill gap to develop; (ii) the \nprivate sector is still in its infancy and unable to provide on-the-job training in many areas; (iii) \npost-secondary institutions are unable to provide quality certificate and diploma programs in \nareas critical to regional development as qualified teachers are in short supply, thereby limiting \n                                                 \n1  The TA for Capacity Building for Regional Development first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, (Internet \nedition), on 7 May 2003. \n2 United Nations Development Programme. 2001. Human Development Report. New York. \n ", "2 \nthe number of quality programs offered;3 (iv) a top-down approach has resulted in lack of \nownership in projects, most of which were determined by government and/or donor agencies, \nfollowing lengthy gestation periods; and (v) atoll capacities and operational resources have \nproven inadequate. Most projects have thus failed due to lack of maintenance and care by the \nbeneficiaries. In some cases, design capacities did not anticipate the level of demand for \nservices, and installed capacities were exceeded before the estimated time for expansion.  \n \n6.  A recent internal review of the effectiveness and capacity of regional development \nmanagement offices (RDMOs) and island and atoll offices identified the key constraint on \nprovision of basic services on atolls: the shortage of adequately trained human resources. Most \nnational and local government staff as well as civil society involved in planning have not been \nexposed to modern participatory planning techniques. The staff need to acquire the knowledge \nto  identify  public  and  private  sector  economic  opportunities  that  will  stimulate  sustainable \ndevelopment. The staff also require exposure to modern methods of environmental planning \nand management. To ensure that existing and future projects are adequately managed, training \nin project management, including accounting, budget planning, and scheduling techniques, is \nalso required.  \n \n7.  Although  several  donor  agencies,  including  the  Islamic  Development  Bank,  United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank are active in the Maldives, ADB\u2019s \nRegional Development Project4 was the first that directly supported the Government\u2019s strategy \nfor  regional  development  by  providing  basic  infrastructure  and  institutional  support  to  the \nnorthern and southern development regions. In July 2002 ADB approved a preparatory TA for \nRegional  Development  Phase  II,  which  builds  on  the  lessons  learned  through  Regional \nDevelopment Project I (RDP I) and provides continued support to the Government\u2019s efforts to \ndevelop the outer atolls. The support, which is urgently needed to help control environmental \ndeterioration,  focuses  on  providing  social  infrastructure  to  improve  living  conditions  of \ndisadvantaged atoll people by offering them opportunities for self-reliance and cash generation \nthrough rapid provision of basic social and economic services, and by building local capacity to \nsupport  local  development  initiatives5.  UNDP\u2019s  program  focuses  on  empowering  local \ncommunities, through which local governance may be strengthened and communities helped to \ntake charge of activities affecting most Maldevians. Community empowerment will form the \nbasis for a strong partnership between the Government and communities to resolve many \ndevelopmental challenges being addressed by the Government, notably through the regional \ndevelopment program. ADB\u2019s experience, however, is that line agencies and local governments \ncontinue to face severe human resource limitations and scarcity of skilled and experienced staff, \nthereby impeding effective program implementation. ADB6 and the World Bank are helping \n                                                 \n3  ADB 1998.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPostsecondary Education Development. Manila (Loan 1637-SRI) seeks to build the capacity and quality of post-\nsecondary institutions in the Maldives. \n4 ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRegional Development Project. Manila (Loan 1695-SRI) is in its last phases. All main infrastructure components \nare in place, and the project is expected to be completed by December 2004. The project includes a balance of \ninstitutional, infrastructure, and environmental improvements in 13 focus islands. The main components are (i) \nconstruction of RDMOs in the northern and southern development regions; (ii) upgrading of a 17 km road from Gan \nto  Hithadhoo;  (iii)  enhancement  of  rainwater  collection  and  sanitation;  (iv)  establishment  of  solid  waste \nmanagement; (v) opening up of ocean-to-lagoon water flows, and (vi) environmental monitoring. \n5  Loan 1695-MLD (ADB. 1999. Regional Development Phase II will focus on the south-central, central and north-\ncentral development regions. \n6  ADB has been helping the Government establish sound organizational structures, regulations, and procedures \nthrough Loan 1915-MLD(SF) (ADB. 2002. Strengthening of the Public Accounting System Project. Manila); and \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  support  through  Loan  1882-MLD(SF)  (ADB.  2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will continue to support the Government\u2019s goal of regional development to \nspread development benefits equitably throughout the Maldives. RDP I showed that due to \nscarcity of skilled and experienced staff, line agencies and local government have limited \ncapacity, resulting in delay in project implementation. The TA therefore aims to improve capacity \nof staff in key project sectors. The TA\u2019s primary purpose is to help atoll offices, existing RDMOs, \nand island communities provide integrated basic services and carry out participatory planning. \nThe final TA output will be increased awareness of environmental and planning issues and \nincreased capacity for local management of project activities and community infrastructure and \nservices.  The  TA  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  World  Bank-assisted  Integrated  Human \nDevelopment  Project  and  the  ADB-supported  Employment  Skills  Development  Project  to \nimprove and develop the capacity of key personnel in key economic sectors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will engage an accredited university, consulting firm, or agency affiliated with an \naccredited university to carry out four 1\u20132-month courses in Male and on the focus islands. \nEach course will accommodate at least 10 students. A committee chaired by a representative of \nthe Ministry of Planning and National Development (MPND) and composed of representatives of \nthe ministries of atoll administration, education; human resources; health; home affairs, housing, \nand environment; and finance and treasury; and of the Maldives College of Higher Education \nwill select the participants in a transparent manner. They will be chosen from RDMOs, selected \nline  ministries  and  agencies,  atoll  and  island  offices,  as  well  as  island  and  women's \ndevelopment committees. Students will not be restricted from attending more than one course. \nThe Government will send the final list of participants to ADB for confirmation before fielding \nconsultants. Upon completing the course, participants will receive a completion certificate. Each \ncourse will be equivalent to a transferable semester credit, which will be recognized by any \ninternational  university  should  the  participants  decide  to  pursue  higher-level  studies.  All \nparticipants should carry out their responsibilities for at least a year in their respective ministries, \nfocusing on regional development; in one of the offices on one of the islands; or in the island \ncommunities (through a community-based organization or NGO, for example). \n \n10.  To strengthen the partnership with overseas educational staff, expand and improve \ncourse  offerings,  upgrade  local  staff  capacity,  and  ensure  follow-up  training,  the  TA  will \ncoordinate with the Maldives College of Higher Education to include courses offered under the \nTA into the institution\u2019s distance learning program and set up a collaborative program with a \nuniversity overseas. \n \n11.  As  part  of  the  interested  university\u2019s  proposal,  four  courses  will  be  developed:  (i) \nparticipatory  community  development  planning,  to  include  integration  of  statistics  into  the \nplanning  process  to  analyze  trends  and  opportunities;  (ii)  regional  economic  planning  of \ninterisland systems, to include the identification of financing sources to stimulate development \nand  private  sector  involvement;  (iii)  environmental  management  in  island  communities,  to \n ", "4 \ninclude water quality and sanitation, solid waste management, and coastal zone management; \nand (iv) project management and accounting, to include project planning, and awarding and \nmanagement of contracts such as for civil works and financial management. A recommendation \nis that RDMO, atoll, and island office staff participating in the regional economic planning course \nalso take the participatory community development planning course. \n \n12.  MPND  will  evaluate  each  course  based  on  participants\u2019  feedback  and  course \nadministrators\u2019 reports. Lessons learned will be incorporated in subsequent course design.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $415,000 equivalent, of which $256,500 will be \nforeign  currency  costs,  and  $158,500  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  finance  $350,000 \nequivalent, which includes all  foreign currency costs, and $93,500 of local currency costs. The \nremaining  $65,000  will  be  contributed  by  the  Government  and  will  include  office \naccommodation, lecture venue, counterpart staff remuneration, and transportation. The TA will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the TA Executing Agency and MPND will \nbe the TA Implementing Agency. The domestic consultant will be assisted by the project \nmonitoring unit under Loan 1695-MLD Regional Development Project (footnote 4). MPND will \nensure that adequate space, furniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for the courses are \nprovided on the focus islands and in Male where the courses are to be held. The Maldives \nCollege of Higher Education could provide lecture room facilities for the course to be held in \nMale.  \n \n15.  The consulting team will include four international consultants (6.5 person-months total) \nand one domestic consultant (3.0 person-months total). The team will include a participatory \ncommunity  planning  specialist,  an  economic  and  development  planning  specialist,  an \nenvironmental  specialist  with  knowledge  of  island  environmental  systems,  and  a  project \nmanagement specialist. All consultants will be selected and engaged through an academic or \nresearch institution or firm associated with an academic or research institution, following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal format and the quality-based selection \nmethod  will  be  used.  The  consultants  will  procure  equipment  through  direct  purchase,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  start  in  March  2004  and  be  completed  by  July  2004.  Each  course \nadministrator will submit a report summarizing course activities, progress of participants, and \ntheir feedback. The domestic consultant will then prepare the following: (i) an inception report, \nno later than 3 weeks after the first course starts, detailing the participant selection process; (ii) \na midterm report, two months after TA inception; and (iii) a draft final report, four weeks after \ninception,  evaluating  each  course  and  summarizing  the  findings,  issues,  and  constraints \nencountered throughout the TA. The Government and ADB will comment on the draft final \nreport. The final report will be submitted within three weeks after receiving comments from the \nreview. \n \n ", "    5 \n \nIV.
