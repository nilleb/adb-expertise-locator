INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) endorsed the \nestablishment of the APEC Financial Regulators Training Initiative (FRTI) in 1998 to build staff \nexpertise at financial supervisory and regulatory authorities in Asia and the Pacific and thereby \nenhance the stability of the region\u2019s financial sector.1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nserved as the secretariat for the FRTI since its creation and has supported it throughout with \ntechnical assistance. Phase 1 of the initiative was implemented during 1998\u20132000.2  Phase 2, \nwhich was supposed to end in 2008 was extended for 2 years by the 15th meeting of APEC \nfinance ministers in November 2008 in Trujillo, Peru.3 During the FRTI\u2019s 15th annual meeting at \nADB headquarters in July 2010, the FRTI\u2019s two advisory groups, composed of supervisors and \nregulators of bank and securities sectors in APEC economies, agreed unanimously to continue \nthe implementation of the FRTI. 4 \n \n2.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA)  aims to strengthen the \ncapacity of financial supervisory and regulatory authorities in Asia and the Pacific through the \nconduct of training programs under the initiative from 2011\u20132012. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the global financial and economic crisis that began in \n2008  demonstrated  that  regulated  and  unregulated  financial  institutions  are  tightly  linked \nthrough markets and counterparty relationships and that this can create and spread contagion. \nBoth crises exposed the Asian economies\u2019 failure to identify, mitigate, and resolve systemic risk. \nIn addition to transparent policies and governance, many economies around the world need \nmore effective financial regulators capable of applying international standards in the regulation \nand supervision of their financial sectors. Recent events have also highlighted the need for \nredesigned  training  programs  that  are  tailored  to  the  specific  needs  of  staff  at  financial \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  agencies.  The  APEC  member  economies  have  committed \nthemselves to implementing the core principles for banking and securities regulation developed \nby  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  and  the  International  Organization  of  Securities \nCommissions. \n                                                \n1  The member economies of APEC are Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New \nGuinea; Peru; the Philippines; the Russian Federation; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and \nViet Nam. \n2  ADB. 1997.

The members of the group \nadvising on securities  regulation are Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, China; \nIndia;  Indonesia;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  New  Zealand;  the  Philippines,  Singapore;  Sri  Lanka; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam. At present, the secretariat is in the process of inviting the \nFinancial Supervisory Agency (Japan). \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 December 2010.  \n ", "2     \n4.  The recent global financial turmoil, which spread from a 2007 housing price collapse and  \nsubprime  mortgage  crisis  in  the  United  States  (US),  underlined  the  importance  of  strong \nprudential standards, supervision, and regulation to the stability of financial systems. Global \npost-crisis  financial  regulatory  reform  proposals  put  forth  by  Group  of  Twenty  important \nindustrialized and developing economies  in November 2010 focused on (i) decreasing the \nlikelihood that a similar financial crisis will recur, and (ii) ensuring that the costs of any future \nfailure will be borne not by taxpayers but by the failing banking and the financial sectors. \nFinancial regulators must be able to oversee and enforce these new requirements and to adapt \nto a more comprehensive and demanding regulatory environment.  \n \n5.  The FRTI has taken a systematic, integrated, and sustained approach to improving the \nquality and efficiency of financial supervision and regulation.6 It provides efficient, cost-effective \ntraining that focuses on enhancing the analytical and technical capacities of bank supervisors \nand securities regulators and creates a training structure for junior and mid-level staff and \npotential instructors.  \n \n6.  ADB provides technical inputs to FRTI\u2019s two advisory groups of bank supervisors and \nsecurities regulators from member economies  that steer implementation of the FRTI.7 The \nadvisory groups provide guidance and technical support and determine the contents of training \nprograms,  based  on  priorities  identified  by  APEC  members  and  through  surveys  and \nevaluations of participants that assess the quality and effectiveness of training seminars and of \nthe approaches and methods used. The results allow the advisory groups to suggest ways to \nimprove the training programs in terms of their (i) relevance to the needs of financial regulatory \ninstitutions, (ii) common interest on regional financial sector stability and high value; and (iii) \nrelevance to core financial supervisory and regulatory functions. \n \n7.  The FRTI offers separate programs for banking supervisors and securities regulators.8 \nThe resource persons for banking seminars come from such regulatory agencies in APEC \ncountries as the US Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial \nInstitutions  Canada,  as  well  as  from  international  training  centers  and  public  and  private \ninstitutions with considerable experience in banking supervision. The presenters and facilitators \nfor the securities program come primarily from APEC member regulatory agencies, including the \nSecurities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, the Securities Commission Malaysia, the \nMonetary Authority of Singapore, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the \nOntario Securities Commission in Canada, the Financial Services Authority in United Kingdom, \nthe  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and  the  US  Commodity  Futures  Trading \nCommission.  \n \n8.  FRTI content, programs, and management have been upgraded regularly to keep pace \nwith changing regulatory environment and demands, such as the development of new short in-\ndepth training seminars to cater the specific training demands of both bank supervisors and \nsecurities  regulators.  The  FRTI  disseminates  information  and  has  expanded  its  marketing \n                                                \n6  Phase 1 of FRTI, implemented from 1998-2000, centered on improving the management of national training \nprograms and program quality. Phase 2 focused on strengthening the conduct of regional and national training \ncourses, developing training materials and distributing them to APEC member economies, and improving the \ncoordination of regional and international training.  \n7  The FRTI organization structure appears on ADB\u2019s website. http://www.adb.org/Projects/APEC/structure.asp \n8  Training programs last from 3 to 5 days and are held at ADB headquarters and in host institutions throughout the \nregion. As the secretariat, ADB is responsible for implementing training activities and recruiting resource persons, \nin consultation with the host institutions. Participation in the training programs is free of charge. The participants\u2019 \ninstitution, however, bear the airfare, hotel accommodation, and other related costs for trainees. \n ", "    3 \nthrough a website that allows an exchange of ideas and distributes the FRTI brochure and \nquarterly  newsletters.9 The  guidelines  for  preparing  the  FRTI  training  seminar  have  been \nprovided to financial supervisory and regulatory agencies in the region, which would like to host \ntraining  seminars  in  cooperation  with the  Secretariat,  in an effort to control its quality and \nensuring that the conduct of the training seminar is in accordance with the unified procedure. The \ninitiative organized 46 banking supervision seminars and 35 securities regulation seminars \nduring 2011\u20132010, as well as two 3-day training programs for the two groups together on \ncommon issues and new approaches requiring coordination. It trained 3,293 regulators and \nsupervisors overall. Given strong demand, the FRTI increased the number of annual regional \nbanking and securities regulators seminars from seven in 2007 to 10 seminars in 2010. It has \nalso added short courses designed for the specific needs of member economies. To exchange \ninternational experiences, enrich group work, and widen networks, FRTI courses are no longer \nlimited to APEC and ADB members. As a result, staff from supervisory and regulatory agencies \nfrom non-APEC and non-ADB members such as Jamaica, the Russian Federation, Mauritius, \nand Tanzania  participated in the training initiative in 2008\u20132010.  \n   \n9.  To meet the constant need for regional training programs, in July 2010, the advisory \ngroup  members  have  unanimously  approved  the  continuation  of  the  FRTI  and  have \nrecommended  possible  training  topics  for  2011.10 The  TA  will  serve  as  phase  3  in  the \nimplementation of the FRTI. This phase will focus on reviewing the advisory groups strategic \ndirections; strengthening the capacity of financial supervision and regulation; improving FRTI \nmethods  in  implementing  the  training  programs,  based  on  the  results  of  the  independent \nevaluation study; upgrading the FRTI website; and ensuring the long-term financial sustainability \nof the current framework.11 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA will strengthen the capability for financial supervision and regulation in Asia and \nthe Pacific and respond effectively to new developments, issues, and trends by enhancing the \ncapacity  of  financial  sector  regulators  and  supervisors  to  apply  updated  international  best \npractices in banking supervision and securities regulation.  \n \n11.  The TA will aim to (i) develop and provide broad-based training for junior and mid-level \nfinancial  sector  regulators  and  supervisors,  (ii)  strengthen  the  training  programs  for  bank \nsupervisors  and  securities  regulators  to  better  address  the  needs  of  the  new  regulatory \n                                                \n9  ADB. APEC Financial Regulators Training Initiative. http://www.adb.org/Projects/APEC/ \n10  Topics include (i) risk management and internal controls; (ii) corporate governance; (iii) Basel II, the  second of the \nBasel Accords, which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on \nBanking Supervision; (iv) stress testing; bank analysis and examination; (v) financial analysis, forensic accounting \nand auditing; (vi) derivatives (including structured products and risk); (vii) market supervision, with a focus on \nmarket intermediaries; (viii) investigation and enforcement; (ix) regulation of new products; and (x) implementation \nof the new International Organization of Securities Commissions principles. Other topics to be considered for 2011 \nand thereafter are macro-prudential supervision, liquidity risk management, and credit risk management. \n11 The 2009 TA (footnote 3) was meant not only to extend phase 2 of the FRTI but also to conduct an independent \nevaluation study of the FRTI\u2019s impact and relevance to financial sector regulation and supervision from 2000-2010. \nInitial findings of the evaluation study include the need to (i) reassess the aims, priorities, objectives, and strategic \nplans of each advisory group to ensure the sustainability of FRTI programs; (ii) improve the feedback metrics to \ncover the relevance and quality of the program in comparison with competitor programs and to gather information \non the competitor programs and changing market trends for discussion at the advisory group level; and (iii) improve \nthe FRTI website in terms of usefulness to the participants. \n ", "4     \nenvironment, (iii) improve the coordination of regional and international training programs, and \n(iv) promote cooperation and collaboration by regional financial supervisory authorities. The \nexpected  outcome  is  enhanced  capacity  of  financial  sector  regulators  and  supervisors  to \nimplement international best practices of banking supervision and securities regulation, with a \nfocus on systemic propagation of the post-crisis financial regulatory framework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n12.  The specific outputs of the TA are as follows: \n(i)  Output  1:  Revised  strategic  plans.  The  aims,  priorities,  objectives,  and \nprinciples  of  the  advisory  groups  in  the  development  of  the  FRTI  will  be \ndocumented. This will include a stocktaking report on other financial regulators \ntraining programs done outside the FRTI. This report will inform the discussions \nby the advisory groups on the FRTI\u2019s future direction and sustainability and help \nthem ensure that FRTI training programs complement rather than duplicate other \nprograms  and  will  remain  financially  sustainable  and  relevant.  To  design  a \nstrategy  and  plan  for  sustainability,  partnerships  with  training  and  financial \ninstitutions  and  other  developed  APEC  and  ADB  member  countries  will  be \npursued.   \n(ii)  Output 2: Efficient and upgraded training programs. Training programs for \nfinancial  supervisors  and  regulators  will  be  continuously  upgraded  and \nstrengthened by an improved feedback mechanism and the stocktaking report. \nThe TA will support the updating of the FRTI curricula and course materials by \nfinancial  supervisory  authorities  and  regional  institutions,  incorporating  the \ninternational best practices in banking supervision and securities regulation. It will \ncontinue building toward a critical mass of trainers in the region by training \nselected financial supervisory and regulatory officials.  \n(iii)  Output  3:  International  seminar  on  financial  market  supervision  and \nregulation. The TA will support an international seminar for financial supervisors \nand regulators that will promote regulatory cooperation across the region and \nexpand the understanding of the regulatory reform measures being undertaken \nacross the world\u2019s financial markets. \n(iv)  Output 4: Case studies with regional content produced from a regional \nperspective. The TA will support the development and updating of regional case \nstudies that will be used as a basic teaching tool and reference material for \ntraining seminars under the FRTI. \n(v)  Output  5: Upgraded  website. To upgrade the FRTI website, which is now \nhosted  under  the  ADB  website,  the  TA  will  develop  improvements  to  allow \ndistinctive  access  levels  and  information  for  advisory  group  members, \nparticipants, and presenters, focusing on online access to presentation materials, \ninformation, research papers, and networks specific to the programs attended. \nThe website will be created independently from the ADB website but will be \nlinked  to  ADB  through  the  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  (OREI) \nwebsite.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which (i) the equivalent of $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund,  \nand administered by ADB, and (ii) the equivalent of $450,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \n ", "    5 \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility.12 The cost will cover the remuneration and travel \nexpenses  of  international  and  national  consultants,  the  travel  expenses  of  seminar  and \nconference  resource  persons,  the  upgrading  of  training  programs  and  website,  and  other \nmiscellaneous expenses. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency. OREI will implement the TA in close coordination with \nthe FRTI advisory groups. \n \n15.  TA activities will be implemented with the help of international and national consultants \nand resource persons. ADB will serve as the FRTI\u2019s secretariat and the two advisory groups, \ncomprising  bank  supervisors  and  securities  regulators  from  FRTI  member  economies,  will \nprovide  guidance  and  technical  support  and  steer  its  implementation.  Good  practices  and \nlessons will be (i) disseminated in advisory group meetings and the APEC senior finance \nofficials\u2019 meeting, and (ii) published on the FRTI website and in newsletters. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  about  11  person-months  of  international  consulting  services, \n43 person-months of national consulting services, and 9 person-months of resource persons\u2019 \nparticipation.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  1  year  and  8  months,  from  May  2011  to \nDecember 2012. Consultants and resource persons will be recruited individually, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).13 The \nscope  of  work  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  To \nimplement the TA successfully, a team of OREI staff (one international staff member, one \nnational  officer,  and  one  operations  assistant),  assisted  by  the  project  specialist  and \ncoordinating expert, will coordinate and manage consultants and consolidate their individual \noutputs. Disbursements under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  Purchasing of equipment (i.e., computer hardware and software) will be undertaken by \nADB, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and Office of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be \ndisposed of in compliance with the project administration instructions on administering grant-\nfinanced technical assistance.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund; \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Strengthening  Support  for  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Financial  Regulators \nTraining Initiative, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n12  Established by ADB. \n13 Based on ADB\u2019s experience as the FRTI secretariat, hiring individual consultants is more effective and flexible than \nengaging a firm. The project team leader (international staff) and the secretariat will have (i) flexibility in the \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring of FRTI activities; and (ii) more opportunity to have direct dealings with \nand accommodate pressing demands of the FRTI advisory groups to which ADB directly reports.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources \nand \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nStrengthen the capability  International best-practice  Progress  Political commitment of regional \nfor financial sector  approaches incorporated in  report of the  countries to financial sector \nsupervision and regulation  financial sector regulation and  FRTI  reforms \nin the region and respond  supervision \n  Independence of financial \neffectively to new \nregulators \ndevelopments and \nemerging issues and trends   Risks \nMacroeconomic and financial \nmarket instability \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced capacity of  At least 600 selected staff from  Interim and  Commitment of participating \nfinancial sector regulators  supervisory and regulatory  annual reports  countries in FRTI to common \nand supervisors for  authorities trained in priority  goals and incorporating best \n \nimplementing international  topics  practices in training programs \nbest practices in banking   \nEarly interventions increased  Adequate interest among ADB \nsupervision and securities \nwhen required  members in hosting, providing \nregulation \nresource speakers for, and \nnominating participants to training \nprograms \nRisks \nLack of coordination within and \namong institutions and ministries \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
