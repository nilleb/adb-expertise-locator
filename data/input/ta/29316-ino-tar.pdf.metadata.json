INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 1995 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Indonesia (the\nGovernment) requested Bank technical assistance (TA) to finance a review of the agriculture\nsector. A Bank TA Fact-finding Mission visited Indonesia from 7-16 December 1995. The need\nfor the TA was established through wide ranging discussions with the Government, and an\nunderstanding reached on the scope, cost, terms of reference for consulting services and\nimplementation arrangements.' The TA is a firm Project in the Bank's 1996 Country Program\nfor Indonesia.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Agricultural development in Indonesia has been broad-based and relatively rapid.\nDuring the past two decades, average growth rates of 3.8 percent per annum have supported\na tripling of real rural incomes, achievement of near self-sufficiency in rice, and a significant\nreduction in the incidence of rural poverty. However, during the past five years, agricultural\ngrowth has slowed to an average of 2.9 percent per annum, and, during the past two years,\noutput has tended to stagnate. The slowdown in agricultural growth has contributed to an\nincreasing reliance on imported foodstuffs and a widening gap between agriculture and\nnonagriculture sector incomes.2 While agriculture is no longer the leading sector in the\nIndonesian economy, it still provides about 17 percent of gross domestic product, employs close\nto half of the labor force, and generates a quarter of non-oil foreign exchange earnings.\n3. The prospects for agriculture in the medium term are mixed. On the positive side,\nrapid technological changes in food crop production and a changing domestic demand pattern\nin response to rising incomes, as well as changes in global markets, have opened new\nopportunities for increasing agricultural incomes and reducing rural poverty through\ndiversification of output. However, against this positive view, limited scope for increasing rice\nproductivity, the mounting loss of irrigated land in Java to urbanization and industrialization, and\nthe technical and social difficulties associated with promoting diversification and agricultural\ndevelopment outside Java pose formidable constraints to sustained agricultural growth and\ndevelopment. On balance, despite the potential difficulties, considerable scope remains to\nincrease agricultural productivity and to raise farm incomes by diversifying into higher value\nproducts and opening up some of the millions of hectares of land that, environmental and social\nconsiderations notwithstanding, could be deployed for agricultural production purposes.\n4. Indonesia's Second Long-Term Development Program (PJPII) provides a strategic\nvision of economic and social development over the next 25 years. While PJPII envisions a\nprocess of rapid industrialization and structural change, agriculture continues to play a central\nrole as a source of employment and incomes for many small farmers, a provider of strategic\nfoodstuffs and raw materials, the main engine of growth in eastern Indonesia, and a guardian\nof the nation's precious supply of fragile natural resources. In line with the objectives put forth\nin PJPII, the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (REPELITA VI), covering 1994 to 1999, places\nheavy emphasis on raising farm incomes, increasing productivity, promoting competitiveness and\nexport orientation, focusing more attention on the agricultural needs of eastern Indonesia,\nstimulating agribusiness investment, and decentralizing the management of agricultural services.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 1995.\nPer capita gross domestic product in agriculture is one-sixth that in the other sectors.\nIi. i ravel\t \u2014\t 5,000\t 5.000", "2\n5. Meeting this new and challenging set of objectives calls for a major reorientation\nof public sector support in the agriculture sector. Reorientation of public sector support for\nagriculture is a difficult and complicated process. Current policies, programs, and institutions\nwere designed in an era when the overriding concern was with rice production and with the\nimperative of feeding rapidly growing numbers of low-income, agricultural households. Policies\nput into place to achieve those objectives (such as price and trade controls, Government\nmarketing programs, input subsidies, state-owned plantations, commodity production targets,\nand centrally-managed, commodity-based support services) have become constraints to\nenhancing agricultural competitiveness. These policies, and in some cases the accompanying\ninstitutions, are not well suited to facilitating the development of a market-based, dynamic,\nagriculture sector capable of holding its own in both domestic and international markets.\nAlthough there is a general recognition of the need to operate within a more market-based\nframework, it has proven difficult to move away from the system of administrative controls and\nagricultural market restrictions. At the same time, the changing constellation of agriculture sector\nobjectives implies the need to develop new policies, programs, and institutional approaches to\ndifficult challenges such as diversification; regional development (in particular in eastern\nIndonesia); and stimulating agribusiness.\n6. The TA is designed to assist the Government to assess its development options\nand plan future sector strategies, policies, and institutional alternatives in the agriculture sector.\nAn issues-oriented assessment is needed because (i) agricultural development objectives are\nnumerous, making it difficult to set priorities and identify appropriate strategies; (ii) reorienting\nagriculture development requires a continuous process of monitoring new initiatives and seeking\nmore appropriate alternatives; (iii) improved cross-sectoral, inter-institutional cooperation and\ncoordination is required to forge appropriate and effective agricultural support measures; and\n(iv) fairly major changes are likely to be required in public policy and institutional support.\n7. The TA will also make a positive contribution to Indonesia's agricultural planning\nprocess. This task will be closely coordinated with the preparations for REPELITA VII (Seventh\nFive Year Plan Period [1999/2000-2003/04]). The national planning process, coordinated by\nBAPPENAS (the Government's National Development Planning Agency), relies on a mix of\nregional plans and ministry-by-ministry planning submissions, the latter generated from the plans\nput forth by the specialized agencies and directorate generals of each ministry. Within this\nprocess there is a high degree of bureaucratic fragmentation and compartmentalization, making\nit difficult to achieve consistency within the sector or across different regions. The traditional\nplanning process also tends to accord great emphasis to commodity output targets, and far less\nto more aggregate sectoral development objectives, strategies, and public policies. The TA takes\na different approach by (i) focusing on thematic sectoral development issues (rather than\ncommodity matters); (ii) providing a forum to assess a number of key issues where the need for\ninterinstitutional consultation and cooperation is required; and (iii) contributing to a process of\nhigh level interministerial reflection and review of policy and institutional alternatives for\nagriculture development. Through these mechanisms and associated documentation, the Project\nis expected to provide an input into the ongoing process of agricultural policy formulation. Key\nissues of concern to senior policymakers will be reviewed and reported. Appendix 1 shows the\nframework for the TA.\nB.\t One Project outcome will be to improve the effectiveness of external assistance\nto agriculture. The more clearly articulated the agriculture strategy and policy framework, the", "3\neasier it will be to design investment measures in support of agricultural development. Special\nattention will be provided to the changing requirements for external assistance in the agriculture\nsector. In this regard, the TA should help guide future public investment undertakings and assist\nthe donor community, and in particular the Bank, to identify priority areas for future assistance.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The TA will assist the Government to assess its development options and plan\nfuture strategies, policies, and institutional alternatives in the agriculture sector. The assessment\nwill be made as the outcome of a consultation process between stakeholders in the agriculture\nsector in order to shape a shared vision of the challenges and options for reorienting the\nGovernment's support for agriculture, rural economic reconstruction, and agribusiness\ndevelopment.\nB.\t Scope\n10. Working in close cooperation with the Secretary General and the staff of the\nBureau of Planning of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the TA will support REPELITA VII\npreparations by assessing changes in the environment for Indonesian agriculture, the policy and\ninstitutional constraints to enhancing competitiveness, agriculture's current and potential\ncontribution to regional balance, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability, and\nemerging institutional requirements. Background papers on the important issues facing\nagriculture will be prepared as inputs to a roundtable of senior decision makers in the public and\nprivate sectors at which the future direction of the Indonesian agriculture sector can be\ndiscussed. The TA will stimulate different sector stakeholders, such as BAPPENAS, MOA,\nMinistry of Food, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Home Affairs,\nMinistry of Public Works, the Food Logistics Agency (BULOG), Ministry of Cooperatives and\nSmall Enterprise Development, Local Government, and the private sector (including farmers), to\njointly review and discuss policy issues during preparation of the issues papers and at the\nroundtable itself. Each paper, while based on a review of existing materials and consultations\nwith stakeholders, will focus on the issues involved; the available policy options; and their\neconomic, social, budgetary and (where appropriate) environmental implications. The issues\npaper will cover the following topics:\n(i) implications of the changing global trading environment and the need for\ndomestic market reform;\n(ii) constraints on, and opportunities for, further growth in agriculture;\n(iii) the role of the Government and the private sector in facilitating small-scale farmers\nand agribusiness development;\n(iv) the implications of technological change;\n(v) agriculture and development in eastern Indonesia;\n(vi) ways in which small-scale farmers and other rural dwellers can be brought into\nthe process of policy formulation and the role agriculture might play in poverty\nreduction;\n(vii) agriculture and environmental sustainability;", "4\n(viii) decentralization of agricultural support services; and\n(ix) changing requirements for external assistance in Indonesia and the role of the\nBank.\nC. Cost Estimate\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $688,000 equivalent of which the foreign\nexchange component is estimated at $316,000 and the local currency component at $372,000\nequivalent. It is proposed that the Bank finance, on a grant basis, the entire foreign exchange\ncost and a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $284,000 equivalent, for a total of\n$600,000 equivalent. The Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of\n$88,000 equivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n12. BAPPENAS will be the Executing Agency but there will be active involvement by\nother line agencies, in particular, MOA. A TA Steering Committee will be chaired by BAPPENAS\nand will include senior personnel from MOA and other relevant agencies. BAPPENAS and MOA\nwill assign suitable counterpart staff to participate actively in the work conducted under the TA\nand provide support facilities including office accommodation.\n13. It is envisaged that a total of 46 person-months of consulting services will be\nrequired, 9 person-months for international consultants and 37 person-months for domestic\nconsultants, spread over a period of ten months. Consultants will be engaged by the Bank in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to the Bank. Because the technical requirements of the Project are not considered\nto be complex in nature, the Simplified Technical Procedure will be used for the submission of\ntechnical proposals.\n14. Through an international consulting firm, a core team of one international and two\ndomestic consultants will be recruited for the duration of the TA. The international consultant will\nbe the team leader and will work full time in Indonesia for approximately 7.5 months with an\nintervening period of about two months of half-time work at his or her home office. A second\ninternational consultant with considerable stature in Indonesia agriculture policy, to be recruited\nby the international consulting firm during implementation, will work for one-half month, serving\nas a resource person for the proposed roundtable. The two core domestic consultants will work\nfor the full ten months of the Project. The core team will be responsible for managing and\ncoordinating Project activities, drafting five of the nine issues papers, organizing the roundtable\ndiscussions, and organizing and supervising the provision of the other four issues papers by\ndomestic consultants. A total of 17 person-months of domestic consultancy services will be\nrequired to support the preparation of the issues papers not prepared by the core team. In\naddition, the core team will produce a summary of the roundtable discussions and be\nresponsible for finalized versions of the issues papers for inclusion in the final report.\n15. The Project will be carried out in two phases. During the first phase, the core team\nwill review the changing economic environment for the agriculture sector, prepare detailed\nguidelines for the issues papers, recruit and engage other domestic consultants, commence", "5\npreparation of the issues papers, and identify participants in the roundtable. During the second\nphase, the draft issues papers will be completed, roundtable consultations held, and the draft\nand final reports completed. Draft terms of reference and reporting requirements for the\nconsultants are set out in Appendix 3. A range of expertise will be required in agricultural policy;\ninternational trade; the Indonesian agriculture sector and its institutions; Indonesian regional\ndevelopment, agribusiness development, agricultural production, and farming systems; and\nsocioeconomics. The international expert (the team leader) will be an economist with expertise\nin agricultural policy in Indonesia. The other international expert (a resource person for the\nroundtable) will be a policy analyst with experience in Asian food policy matters. The two locally\nrecruited full-time core team members will have expertise and experience in agricultural policy\nand institutional development. Local experts with relevant expertise will be engaged by the\nconsulting firm as domestic consultants to draft the issues papers not covered by the core team.\nThe Project is expected to be completed by September 1997.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of\nIndonesia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the Agriculture Sector\nStrategy Review, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n5,000\t 5.000\nU. i ravel\t \u2014\t", "Appendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions\n1.

Through consultation with representatives of key agricultural agencies,\ncooperatives, the private sector, and nongovernment organizations, the core team will prepare\nthe first two issues papers as follows:\n(i)\t Implications of the Changing Global Trading Environment and the Need for\nDomestic Market Reform\n(a) Examine issues related to changes in major global markets and the main\nimplications of changing trade arrangements on the opportunities and\nchallenges for agriculture. Suggest ways in which Indonesia can take\nadvantage of changes in global market conditions. More specifically,\nreview short-and medium-term market prospects for Indonesia's main\nagricultural commodities (rice, corn, wheat, soybean, poultry, rubber, oil\npalm, and coconut), with particular emphasis on changing global demand\nand supply conditions. Review findings of international assessments of the\nmedium-term global supply and demand situation and agricultural price\nprospects. Discuss the implications of changing market conditions for\nIndonesia. Review the agricultural market reform commitments that\nIndonesia has made under international trade agreements. Discuss the\nimplications that trade reform, globally and in terms of Indonesia's specific\nreform commitments, will have on agriculture. Assess options for future\nagricultural trade reform and the implications of possible changes to the\ntrade regime for the agriculture sector.\n(b) Assess the comparative advantage of irrigated rice, oil palm, and other\nmajor agricultural products in Indonesia. As far as possible, quantify the\ncomparative advantage using one of the standard methodologies but\nmake maximum use of existing analyses and other secondary sources.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 15)\nU. i ravel\t \u2014\t 5,000\t 5.000", "10\nAppendix 3, page 2\n(c) Briefly review major trade, subsidy, and marketing policies in agriculture\nand propose a graduated agenda for enhancing competition and reducing\npolicy or institutional distortions to efficient operation of agricultural\nmarkets. Assess the implications of restrictions on food commodity\nimports and industrial crop exports, and provincial or other local\nrestrictions on the internal marketing of agricultural commodities. Review\nalso restrictions on trade in agro-inputs and subsidies provided on\nfertilizer, rural credit, and other agro-inputs. Building on the findings of\nresearch conducted by the Directorate General of Agro-Industry (Ministry\nof Industry and Trade) and the Agribusiness Board of the Ministry of\nAgriculture (MOA), review other regulatory restrictions to the licensing and\noperation of agribusiness enterprises. Classify the restrictions in terms of\ntheir relative importance to impeding different categories of agro-\nenterprise. Propose alternative agendas for agricultural deregulation and\nassess the likely impacts of such change on agricultural performance,\ntrade, and the Government budget.\nConstraints on, and Opportunities for, Further Growth in Agriculture\n(a) Synthesize and summarize existing knowledge and understanding of the\nmain economic, institutional, social, and technical barriers to increasing\ngrowth and development in agriculture. More specifically, review the main\ntechnical, social, and economic barriers to agricultural growth and\ndevelopment, especially those associated with the agricultural credit and\nmarketing systems. Such constraints should be identified for key\ncommodities and for major regions of the country. Prioritize the\nconstraints, in order to identify those that are most immediately binding in\nthe different regions. Discuss the implications of key constraints for\nframing agriculture sector strategies and policies. Review ways in which\na continuous monitoring and assessment of development constraints can\nbe used to improve agricultural planning and programming.\n(b) Summarize the domestic agricultural demand outlook and review options\nfor enhancing the responsiveness of agriculture to changing patterns of\ndemand. Provide special attention to areas likely to experience rapid\ndemand growth (e.g. horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and industrial crops).\nAs far as possible, disaggregate the demand assessment by urban and\nrural areas and by income groups. For commodity groups likely to\nexperience rapid demand growth, suggest sources of growth that could\nbe employed to meet demand. Particular attention should be given to\nexpansion of the agricultural land frontier, labor absorption, mechanization,\nresource management improvements, agricultural intensification and other\nnew technologies, introduction of new \"high-value\" commodities, reduction\nin waste and other marketing costs, and investment in value-added\nprocessing as potential new sources of growth. Identify ways in which the\nGovernment can provide an enabling environment conducive to tapping\nthese new sources of agricultural growth.", "11\nAppendix 3, page 3\n4. Each issues paper will focus on the policy and institutional issues and will be of\na length and format suitable for use by senior policymakers. Where necessary, conclusions\nreached in the issue papers will be supported by appropriate appendixes. In addition to being\nan important input into the REPELITA planning process, the review of the changing operating\nenvironment for agriculture should help set the context for the preparation of issues papers in\nPhase II.\n2. Plan and Initiate Implementation of Phase II Issues Papers and the Roundtable\n5. Develop an implementation plan for assessing issues affecting the formulation of\npolicy and institutional measures to support agriculture during REPELITA VII. For each of the\nremaining issues papers, prepare detailed terms of reference. Identify issues papers that will be\nprepared by the core team, and for the other issues papers, identify and engage a team of\ndomestic consultants.\n6. Develop a plan for an intersectoral roundtable to review the findings of the issues\npapers. The plan should include the proposed dates, participating institutions, and the venue for\nthe roundtable. Efforts should be made to ensure active consultation with the different agencies\nthat are expected to participate.\nB.\t Phase II: Assessment of Sector Issues and Reform Options\n7. Following the issues papers drafted under Phase I, an additional seven issues\npapers will be drafted. The papers will focus on the policy and institutional issues and again will\nbe of a length and format suitable for use by senior policymakers. Where necessary, conclusions\nreached in the issues papers will be supported by appropriate appendixes.\n0) Government and Private Sector Role in Facilitating Small-scale Farmer\nand Agribusiness Development: Assess strategies undertaken to\npromote investment in commercial agriculture and agro-industrial\ndevelopment. Examine the process by which property rights in rural land\nare provided, and suggest mechanisms that can be used to improve land-\nuse management. Draw on cases conducted in different parts of the\nregion to suggest ways in which secure property rights can be promoted.\nWhere titling and land registration are deficient, suggest mechanisms for\naccelerating this process. In addition, suggest an appropriate role and set\nof measures that Government may pursue to spur agribusiness\ndevelopment. Examine the measures now being pursued by the\nGovernment, and assess the degree to which these are appropriate for the\npublic sector, whether they fill a real perceived need in the private sector,\nand whether they are likely to be effective. Devote special attention to\napproaches related to improving the role and effectiveness of farmers'\ngroups, cooperatives, and small-scale agro-industry. Develop a strategy\nfor coordinated and coherent assistance to the development of the agro-\nindustry sector. Such a strategy should be clearly prioritized and include\npractical, operational recommendations suited to the prevailing institutional\nfabric of the public and private sectors.", "12\nAppendix 3, page 4\nThe Implications of Technological Change: Discuss the proposed\nstrategy for remolding the agricultural information system, including\nresearch, training, and extension. Review the proposed establishment of\na network of technology assessment institutes. Identify ways in which\nthese new institutes can coordinate their activities with those of the other\nresearch centers, local universities, and other centers of agricultural\nresearch. Examine the governance of the research system and suggest\nways in which user input can be reflected more directly in the governance\nand financing of the research system. Assess the implications of the\nassumption of high-level extension efforts by MOA within the Technology\nAssessment Institutes, and discuss measures to improve the quality and\naccountability of the extension service. Review the recent decentralization\nof the extension service, and identify key lessons from that process.\nBuilding on a recent review of the extension service, assess ways in which\nthe extension service can be revitalized. Identify options for coordinating\nnational and local efforts at technology generation and diffusion. More\ngenerally, identify initiatives that could be taken during the next five years\nto accelerate the generation and diffusion of suitable agricultural\ntechnology in Indonesia.\nAgriculture and Development in Eastern Indonesia: Assess the degree\nto which agriculture contributes to development in Eastern Indonesia and\nto the ways in which agriculture's contribution to regional development\nefforts can be improved. Examine progress made in incorporating locally-\nspecific agriculture efforts in area-based regional development programs.\nExamine also the progress made in targeting grants for agricultural\ndevelopment purposes to less well-endowed areas of Eastern Indonesia\nthrough the Presidential Instruction (INPRES) program and other transfer\nschemes. Assess ways in which voluntary groups and local universities\ncan improve their contribution to agricultural development in Eastern\nIndonesia, and the ways in which the Government can best forge\nconstructive partnerships with these groups. Examine the scope for spatial\nand land-use planning to contribute to regional development aims and\nobjectives. In this context, review the progress made in developing agro-\necological zoning and discuss ways in which socioeconomic information\ncould be better linked to this material. Discuss ways in which land-use\nplanning can be used to guide development, particularly in the more\nfragile areas of Eastern Indonesia. Assess the causes for marketing\nbottlenecks and market failures in Eastern Indonesia. Examine the different\nmechanisms and degree to which Government can play a role in helping\nto overcome these agricultural marketing problems. Devote particular\nattention to priorities for market infrastructure in areas slated for priority\nattention to agricultural development. Drawing on recent experience with\nprivate-sector supported nucleus estate projects, discuss ways in which\nprivate-public partnerships can be utilized to stimulate agricultural growth\nand employment generation in Eastern Indonesia.", "13\nAppendix 3, page 5\n(iv) Ways in Which Small-scale Farmers and Other Rural Dwellers Can Be\nBrought Into the Process of Policy Formulation and the Role\nAgriculture Might Play in Poverty Reduction: Examine the distribution\nand status of people engaged in agriculture who are classified as poor\nand, more specifically, draw on the Central Bureau of Statistics' poverty\nprofile to identify villages where poverty is most acute. Again draw on\nCentral Bureau of Statistics surveys to develop profiles of poor rural\nhouseholds and review the programs aimed at addressing rural poverty.\nExamine the main programs targeting support to poor villages and\nparticularly the degree of participation by beneficiaries. Review the known\napproaches for involving farmers and other rural dwellers in agricultural\nand rural policy formulation (including land-use planning) and suggest a\nrange of options that could be implemented in the Indonesian context\ntogether with the resources that would be required for their\nimplementation.\n(v) Agriculture and Environmental Sustainability: In the context of\nagricultural expansion into potentially fragile areas, assess existing and\npotential mechanisms to ensure that environmentally sustainable\napproaches to agricultural development are encouraged. Examine the\nissue of agricultural extensification (i) generally, and (ii) in the context of\nthe proposed large-scale clearing of lands to establish rice and oil palm\nestates in Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Discuss measures that could be taken\nto offset adverse environmental effects of agricultural extensification.

INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 1995 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Indonesia (the\nGovernment) requested Bank technical assistance (TA) to finance a review of the agriculture\nsector. A Bank TA Fact-finding Mission visited Indonesia from 7-16 December 1995. The need\nfor the TA was established through wide ranging discussions with the Government, and an\nunderstanding reached on the scope, cost, terms of reference for consulting services and\nimplementation arrangements.' The TA is a firm Project in the Bank's 1996 Country Program\nfor Indonesia.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Agricultural development in Indonesia has been broad-based and relatively rapid.\nDuring the past two decades, average growth rates of 3.8 percent per annum have supported\na tripling of real rural incomes, achievement of near self-sufficiency in rice, and a significant\nreduction in the incidence of rural poverty. However, during the past five years, agricultural\ngrowth has slowed to an average of 2.9 percent per annum, and, during the past two years,\noutput has tended to stagnate. The slowdown in agricultural growth has contributed to an\nincreasing reliance on imported foodstuffs and a widening gap between agriculture and\nnonagriculture sector incomes.2 While agriculture is no longer the leading sector in the\nIndonesian economy, it still provides about 17 percent of gross domestic product, employs close\nto half of the labor force, and generates a quarter of non-oil foreign exchange earnings.\n3. The prospects for agriculture in the medium term are mixed. On the positive side,\nrapid technological changes in food crop production and a changing domestic demand pattern\nin response to rising incomes, as well as changes in global markets, have opened new\nopportunities for increasing agricultural incomes and reducing rural poverty through\ndiversification of output. However, against this positive view, limited scope for increasing rice\nproductivity, the mounting loss of irrigated land in Java to urbanization and industrialization, and\nthe technical and social difficulties associated with promoting diversification and agricultural\ndevelopment outside Java pose formidable constraints to sustained agricultural growth and\ndevelopment. On balance, despite the potential difficulties, considerable scope remains to\nincrease agricultural productivity and to raise farm incomes by diversifying into higher value\nproducts and opening up some of the millions of hectares of land that, environmental and social\nconsiderations notwithstanding, could be deployed for agricultural production purposes.\n4. Indonesia's Second Long-Term Development Program (PJPII) provides a strategic\nvision of economic and social development over the next 25 years. While PJPII envisions a\nprocess of rapid industrialization and structural change, agriculture continues to play a central\nrole as a source of employment and incomes for many small farmers, a provider of strategic\nfoodstuffs and raw materials, the main engine of growth in eastern Indonesia, and a guardian\nof the nation's precious supply of fragile natural resources. In line with the objectives put forth\nin PJPII, the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (REPELITA VI), covering 1994 to 1999, places\nheavy emphasis on raising farm incomes, increasing productivity, promoting competitiveness and\nexport orientation, focusing more attention on the agricultural needs of eastern Indonesia,\nstimulating agribusiness investment, and decentralizing the management of agricultural services.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 1995.\nPer capita gross domestic product in agriculture is one-sixth that in the other sectors.\nIi. i ravel\t \u2014\t 5,000\t 5.000", "2\n5. Meeting this new and challenging set of objectives calls for a major reorientation\nof public sector support in the agriculture sector. Reorientation of public sector support for\nagriculture is a difficult and complicated process. Current policies, programs, and institutions\nwere designed in an era when the overriding concern was with rice production and with the\nimperative of feeding rapidly growing numbers of low-income, agricultural households. Policies\nput into place to achieve those objectives (such as price and trade controls, Government\nmarketing programs, input subsidies, state-owned plantations, commodity production targets,\nand centrally-managed, commodity-based support services) have become constraints to\nenhancing agricultural competitiveness. These policies, and in some cases the accompanying\ninstitutions, are not well suited to facilitating the development of a market-based, dynamic,\nagriculture sector capable of holding its own in both domestic and international markets.\nAlthough there is a general recognition of the need to operate within a more market-based\nframework, it has proven difficult to move away from the system of administrative controls and\nagricultural market restrictions. At the same time, the changing constellation of agriculture sector\nobjectives implies the need to develop new policies, programs, and institutional approaches to\ndifficult challenges such as diversification; regional development (in particular in eastern\nIndonesia); and stimulating agribusiness.\n6. The TA is designed to assist the Government to assess its development options\nand plan future sector strategies, policies, and institutional alternatives in the agriculture sector.\nAn issues-oriented assessment is needed because (i) agricultural development objectives are\nnumerous, making it difficult to set priorities and identify appropriate strategies; (ii) reorienting\nagriculture development requires a continuous process of monitoring new initiatives and seeking\nmore appropriate alternatives; (iii) improved cross-sectoral, inter-institutional cooperation and\ncoordination is required to forge appropriate and effective agricultural support measures; and\n(iv) fairly major changes are likely to be required in public policy and institutional support.\n7. The TA will also make a positive contribution to Indonesia's agricultural planning\nprocess. This task will be closely coordinated with the preparations for REPELITA VII (Seventh\nFive Year Plan Period [1999/2000-2003/04]). The national planning process, coordinated by\nBAPPENAS (the Government's National Development Planning Agency), relies on a mix of\nregional plans and ministry-by-ministry planning submissions, the latter generated from the plans\nput forth by the specialized agencies and directorate generals of each ministry. Within this\nprocess there is a high degree of bureaucratic fragmentation and compartmentalization, making\nit difficult to achieve consistency within the sector or across different regions. The traditional\nplanning process also tends to accord great emphasis to commodity output targets, and far less\nto more aggregate sectoral development objectives, strategies, and public policies. The TA takes\na different approach by (i) focusing on thematic sectoral development issues (rather than\ncommodity matters); (ii) providing a forum to assess a number of key issues where the need for\ninterinstitutional consultation and cooperation is required; and (iii) contributing to a process of\nhigh level interministerial reflection and review of policy and institutional alternatives for\nagriculture development. Through these mechanisms and associated documentation, the Project\nis expected to provide an input into the ongoing process of agricultural policy formulation. Key\nissues of concern to senior policymakers will be reviewed and reported. Appendix 1 shows the\nframework for the TA.\nB.\t One Project outcome will be to improve the effectiveness of external assistance\nto agriculture. The more clearly articulated the agriculture strategy and policy framework, the", "3\neasier it will be to design investment measures in support of agricultural development. Special\nattention will be provided to the changing requirements for external assistance in the agriculture\nsector. In this regard, the TA should help guide future public investment undertakings and assist\nthe donor community, and in particular the Bank, to identify priority areas for future assistance.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The TA will assist the Government to assess its development options and plan\nfuture strategies, policies, and institutional alternatives in the agriculture sector. The assessment\nwill be made as the outcome of a consultation process between stakeholders in the agriculture\nsector in order to shape a shared vision of the challenges and options for reorienting the\nGovernment's support for agriculture, rural economic reconstruction, and agribusiness\ndevelopment.\nB.\t Scope\n10. Working in close cooperation with the Secretary General and the staff of the\nBureau of Planning of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the TA will support REPELITA VII\npreparations by assessing changes in the environment for Indonesian agriculture, the policy and\ninstitutional constraints to enhancing competitiveness, agriculture's current and potential\ncontribution to regional balance, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability, and\nemerging institutional requirements. Background papers on the important issues facing\nagriculture will be prepared as inputs to a roundtable of senior decision makers in the public and\nprivate sectors at which the future direction of the Indonesian agriculture sector can be\ndiscussed. The TA will stimulate different sector stakeholders, such as BAPPENAS, MOA,\nMinistry of Food, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Home Affairs,\nMinistry of Public Works, the Food Logistics Agency (BULOG), Ministry of Cooperatives and\nSmall Enterprise Development, Local Government, and the private sector (including farmers), to\njointly review and discuss policy issues during preparation of the issues papers and at the\nroundtable itself. Each paper, while based on a review of existing materials and consultations\nwith stakeholders, will focus on the issues involved; the available policy options; and their\neconomic, social, budgetary and (where appropriate) environmental implications. The issues\npaper will cover the following topics:\n(i) implications of the changing global trading environment and the need for\ndomestic market reform;\n(ii) constraints on, and opportunities for, further growth in agriculture;\n(iii) the role of the Government and the private sector in facilitating small-scale farmers\nand agribusiness development;\n(iv) the implications of technological change;\n(v) agriculture and development in eastern Indonesia;\n(vi) ways in which small-scale farmers and other rural dwellers can be brought into\nthe process of policy formulation and the role agriculture might play in poverty\nreduction;\n(vii) agriculture and environmental sustainability;", "4\n(viii) decentralization of agricultural support services; and\n(ix) changing requirements for external assistance in Indonesia and the role of the\nBank.\nC. Cost Estimate\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $688,000 equivalent of which the foreign\nexchange component is estimated at $316,000 and the local currency component at $372,000\nequivalent. It is proposed that the Bank finance, on a grant basis, the entire foreign exchange\ncost and a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $284,000 equivalent, for a total of\n$600,000 equivalent. The Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of\n$88,000 equivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n12. BAPPENAS will be the Executing Agency but there will be active involvement by\nother line agencies, in particular, MOA. A TA Steering Committee will be chaired by BAPPENAS\nand will include senior personnel from MOA and other relevant agencies. BAPPENAS and MOA\nwill assign suitable counterpart staff to participate actively in the work conducted under the TA\nand provide support facilities including office accommodation.\n13. It is envisaged that a total of 46 person-months of consulting services will be\nrequired, 9 person-months for international consultants and 37 person-months for domestic\nconsultants, spread over a period of ten months. Consultants will be engaged by the Bank in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to the Bank. Because the technical requirements of the Project are not considered\nto be complex in nature, the Simplified Technical Procedure will be used for the submission of\ntechnical proposals.\n14. Through an international consulting firm, a core team of one international and two\ndomestic consultants will be recruited for the duration of the TA. The international consultant will\nbe the team leader and will work full time in Indonesia for approximately 7.5 months with an\nintervening period of about two months of half-time work at his or her home office. A second\ninternational consultant with considerable stature in Indonesia agriculture policy, to be recruited\nby the international consulting firm during implementation, will work for one-half month, serving\nas a resource person for the proposed roundtable. The two core domestic consultants will work\nfor the full ten months of the Project. The core team will be responsible for managing and\ncoordinating Project activities, drafting five of the nine issues papers, organizing the roundtable\ndiscussions, and organizing and supervising the provision of the other four issues papers by\ndomestic consultants. A total of 17 person-months of domestic consultancy services will be\nrequired to support the preparation of the issues papers not prepared by the core team. In\naddition, the core team will produce a summary of the roundtable discussions and be\nresponsible for finalized versions of the issues papers for inclusion in the final report.\n15. The Project will be carried out in two phases. During the first phase, the core team\nwill review the changing economic environment for the agriculture sector, prepare detailed\nguidelines for the issues papers, recruit and engage other domestic consultants, commence", "5\npreparation of the issues papers, and identify participants in the roundtable. During the second\nphase, the draft issues papers will be completed, roundtable consultations held, and the draft\nand final reports completed. Draft terms of reference and reporting requirements for the\nconsultants are set out in Appendix 3. A range of expertise will be required in agricultural policy;\ninternational trade; the Indonesian agriculture sector and its institutions; Indonesian regional\ndevelopment, agribusiness development, agricultural production, and farming systems; and\nsocioeconomics. The international expert (the team leader) will be an economist with expertise\nin agricultural policy in Indonesia. The other international expert (a resource person for the\nroundtable) will be a policy analyst with experience in Asian food policy matters. The two locally\nrecruited full-time core team members will have expertise and experience in agricultural policy\nand institutional development. Local experts with relevant expertise will be engaged by the\nconsulting firm as domestic consultants to draft the issues papers not covered by the core team.\nThe Project is expected to be completed by September 1997.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of\nIndonesia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the Agriculture Sector\nStrategy Review, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n5,000\t 5.000\nU. i ravel\t \u2014\t", "Appendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions\n1.

Suggest ways in which Indonesia can take\nadvantage of changes in global market conditions. More specifically,\nreview short-and medium-term market prospects for Indonesia's main\nagricultural commodities (rice, corn, wheat, soybean, poultry, rubber, oil\npalm, and coconut), with particular emphasis on changing global demand\nand supply conditions. Review findings of international assessments of the\nmedium-term global supply and demand situation and agricultural price\nprospects. Discuss the implications of changing market conditions for\nIndonesia. Review the agricultural market reform commitments that\nIndonesia has made under international trade agreements. Discuss the\nimplications that trade reform, globally and in terms of Indonesia's specific\nreform commitments, will have on agriculture. Assess options for future\nagricultural trade reform and the implications of possible changes to the\ntrade regime for the agriculture sector.\n(b) Assess the comparative advantage of irrigated rice, oil palm, and other\nmajor agricultural products in Indonesia. As far as possible, quantify the\ncomparative advantage using one of the standard methodologies but\nmake maximum use of existing analyses and other secondary sources.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 15)\nU. i ravel\t \u2014\t 5,000\t 5.000", "10\nAppendix 3, page 2\n(c) Briefly review major trade, subsidy, and marketing policies in agriculture\nand propose a graduated agenda for enhancing competition and reducing\npolicy or institutional distortions to efficient operation of agricultural\nmarkets. Assess the implications of restrictions on food commodity\nimports and industrial crop exports, and provincial or other local\nrestrictions on the internal marketing of agricultural commodities. Review\nalso restrictions on trade in agro-inputs and subsidies provided on\nfertilizer, rural credit, and other agro-inputs. Building on the findings of\nresearch conducted by the Directorate General of Agro-Industry (Ministry\nof Industry and Trade) and the Agribusiness Board of the Ministry of\nAgriculture (MOA), review other regulatory restrictions to the licensing and\noperation of agribusiness enterprises. Classify the restrictions in terms of\ntheir relative importance to impeding different categories of agro-\nenterprise. Propose alternative agendas for agricultural deregulation and\nassess the likely impacts of such change on agricultural performance,\ntrade, and the Government budget.\nConstraints on, and Opportunities for, Further Growth in Agriculture\n(a) Synthesize and summarize existing knowledge and understanding of the\nmain economic, institutional, social, and technical barriers to increasing\ngrowth and development in agriculture. More specifically, review the main\ntechnical, social, and economic barriers to agricultural growth and\ndevelopment, especially those associated with the agricultural credit and\nmarketing systems. Such constraints should be identified for key\ncommodities and for major regions of the country. Prioritize the\nconstraints, in order to identify those that are most immediately binding in\nthe different regions. Discuss the implications of key constraints for\nframing agriculture sector strategies and policies. Review ways in which\na continuous monitoring and assessment of development constraints can\nbe used to improve agricultural planning and programming.\n(b) Summarize the domestic agricultural demand outlook and review options\nfor enhancing the responsiveness of agriculture to changing patterns of\ndemand. Provide special attention to areas likely to experience rapid\ndemand growth (e.g. horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and industrial crops).\nAs far as possible, disaggregate the demand assessment by urban and\nrural areas and by income groups. For commodity groups likely to\nexperience rapid demand growth, suggest sources of growth that could\nbe employed to meet demand. Particular attention should be given to\nexpansion of the agricultural land frontier, labor absorption, mechanization,\nresource management improvements, agricultural intensification and other\nnew technologies, introduction of new \"high-value\" commodities, reduction\nin waste and other marketing costs, and investment in value-added\nprocessing as potential new sources of growth. Identify ways in which the\nGovernment can provide an enabling environment conducive to tapping\nthese new sources of agricultural growth.", "11\nAppendix 3, page 3\n4. Each issues paper will focus on the policy and institutional issues and will be of\na length and format suitable for use by senior policymakers. Where necessary, conclusions\nreached in the issue papers will be supported by appropriate appendixes. In addition to being\nan important input into the REPELITA planning process, the review of the changing operating\nenvironment for agriculture should help set the context for the preparation of issues papers in\nPhase II.\n2. Plan and Initiate Implementation of Phase II Issues Papers and the Roundtable\n5. Develop an implementation plan for assessing issues affecting the formulation of\npolicy and institutional measures to support agriculture during REPELITA VII. For each of the\nremaining issues papers, prepare detailed terms of reference. Identify issues papers that will be\nprepared by the core team, and for the other issues papers, identify and engage a team of\ndomestic consultants.\n6. Develop a plan for an intersectoral roundtable to review the findings of the issues\npapers. The plan should include the proposed dates, participating institutions, and the venue for\nthe roundtable. Efforts should be made to ensure active consultation with the different agencies\nthat are expected to participate.\nB.\t Phase II: Assessment of Sector Issues and Reform Options\n7. Following the issues papers drafted under Phase I, an additional seven issues\npapers will be drafted. The papers will focus on the policy and institutional issues and again will\nbe of a length and format suitable for use by senior policymakers. Where necessary, conclusions\nreached in the issues papers will be supported by appropriate appendixes.\n0) Government and Private Sector Role in Facilitating Small-scale Farmer\nand Agribusiness Development: Assess strategies undertaken to\npromote investment in commercial agriculture and agro-industrial\ndevelopment. Examine the process by which property rights in rural land\nare provided, and suggest mechanisms that can be used to improve land-\nuse management. Draw on cases conducted in different parts of the\nregion to suggest ways in which secure property rights can be promoted.\nWhere titling and land registration are deficient, suggest mechanisms for\naccelerating this process. In addition, suggest an appropriate role and set\nof measures that Government may pursue to spur agribusiness\ndevelopment. Examine the measures now being pursued by the\nGovernment, and assess the degree to which these are appropriate for the\npublic sector, whether they fill a real perceived need in the private sector,\nand whether they are likely to be effective. Devote special attention to\napproaches related to improving the role and effectiveness of farmers'\ngroups, cooperatives, and small-scale agro-industry. Develop a strategy\nfor coordinated and coherent assistance to the development of the agro-\nindustry sector. Such a strategy should be clearly prioritized and include\npractical, operational recommendations suited to the prevailing institutional\nfabric of the public and private sectors.", "12\nAppendix 3, page 4\nThe Implications of Technological Change: Discuss the proposed\nstrategy for remolding the agricultural information system, including\nresearch, training, and extension. Review the proposed establishment of\na network of technology assessment institutes. Identify ways in which\nthese new institutes can coordinate their activities with those of the other\nresearch centers, local universities, and other centers of agricultural\nresearch. Examine the governance of the research system and suggest\nways in which user input can be reflected more directly in the governance\nand financing of the research system. Assess the implications of the\nassumption of high-level extension efforts by MOA within the Technology\nAssessment Institutes, and discuss measures to improve the quality and\naccountability of the extension service. Review the recent decentralization\nof the extension service, and identify key lessons from that process.\nBuilding on a recent review of the extension service, assess ways in which\nthe extension service can be revitalized. Identify options for coordinating\nnational and local efforts at technology generation and diffusion. More\ngenerally, identify initiatives that could be taken during the next five years\nto accelerate the generation and diffusion of suitable agricultural\ntechnology in Indonesia.\nAgriculture and Development in Eastern Indonesia: Assess the degree\nto which agriculture contributes to development in Eastern Indonesia and\nto the ways in which agriculture's contribution to regional development\nefforts can be improved. Examine progress made in incorporating locally-\nspecific agriculture efforts in area-based regional development programs.\nExamine also the progress made in targeting grants for agricultural\ndevelopment purposes to less well-endowed areas of Eastern Indonesia\nthrough the Presidential Instruction (INPRES) program and other transfer\nschemes. Assess ways in which voluntary groups and local universities\ncan improve their contribution to agricultural development in Eastern\nIndonesia, and the ways in which the Government can best forge\nconstructive partnerships with these groups. Examine the scope for spatial\nand land-use planning to contribute to regional development aims and\nobjectives. In this context, review the progress made in developing agro-\necological zoning and discuss ways in which socioeconomic information\ncould be better linked to this material. Discuss ways in which land-use\nplanning can be used to guide development, particularly in the more\nfragile areas of Eastern Indonesia. Assess the causes for marketing\nbottlenecks and market failures in Eastern Indonesia. Examine the different\nmechanisms and degree to which Government can play a role in helping\nto overcome these agricultural marketing problems. Devote particular\nattention to priorities for market infrastructure in areas slated for priority\nattention to agricultural development. Drawing on recent experience with\nprivate-sector supported nucleus estate projects, discuss ways in which\nprivate-public partnerships can be utilized to stimulate agricultural growth\nand employment generation in Eastern Indonesia.", "13\nAppendix 3, page 5\n(iv) Ways in Which Small-scale Farmers and Other Rural Dwellers Can Be\nBrought Into the Process of Policy Formulation and the Role\nAgriculture Might Play in Poverty Reduction: Examine the distribution\nand status of people engaged in agriculture who are classified as poor\nand, more specifically, draw on the Central Bureau of Statistics' poverty\nprofile to identify villages where poverty is most acute. Again draw on\nCentral Bureau of Statistics surveys to develop profiles of poor rural\nhouseholds and review the programs aimed at addressing rural poverty.\nExamine the main programs targeting support to poor villages and\nparticularly the degree of participation by beneficiaries. Review the known\napproaches for involving farmers and other rural dwellers in agricultural\nand rural policy formulation (including land-use planning) and suggest a\nrange of options that could be implemented in the Indonesian context\ntogether with the resources that would be required for their\nimplementation.\n(v) Agriculture and Environmental Sustainability: In the context of\nagricultural expansion into potentially fragile areas, assess existing and\npotential mechanisms to ensure that environmentally sustainable\napproaches to agricultural development are encouraged. Examine the\nissue of agricultural extensification (i) generally, and (ii) in the context of\nthe proposed large-scale clearing of lands to establish rice and oil palm\nestates in Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Discuss measures that could be taken\nto offset adverse environmental effects of agricultural extensification. In this\ncontext, review the possible modes for introducing improved technology\npackages where slash and burn cultivation continues. Provide specific\nrecommendations for investments aimed at improving the environmental\nsustainability of agriculture, for strengthening institutions charged with\nprotecting the rural environment and with improving knowledge and\nawareness in the area of agriculture and environmental sustainability.\n(vi) Decentralization of Agricultural Support Services: Review and assess\nthe rationale for assignment of different agricultural support service\nfunctions to different levels of Government. Analyze the experiences\nassociated with the decentralization of agricultural extension and the pilot-\nefforts aimed at decentralizing administration to selected regencies.\nReview the decentralization experience in other parts of the Government,\nmost notably health and education, to identify the best practices and\ndrawbacks to further decentralization and regionalization efforts. Assess\nthe implications of decentralization and regionalization in terms of the\nchanges implied in the role, mandate, size, and operating procedures for\nCentral Government agencies. Draw on the lessons of decentralization\nexperience in agriculture and in other parts of the Government, to develop\na set of recommendations for facilitating an orderly and effective\ndecentralization of agricultural services.\nU. i ravel\t \u2014\t 5,000\t 5.000", "14\nAppendix 3, page 6\n(vii) Changing Requirements for External Assistance to Agriculture and the\nRole of the Bank: For the major external funding agencies, and with\nparticular attention to the Bank, review the assistance programs in\nagriculture and identify needs for possible modification of the level,\ncomposition, or delivery mode of external assistance, in light of anticipated\nchanges in the agricultural development strategy. The views of each of\nthe major agencies should be solicited in preparing this issues paper. The\nconclusions of this assessment should be used to make recommendations\nto the Government and the Bank for future agriculture sector programs\nand project formulation during the next planning period.\n8. The aforementioned assessments should be based on available data, information,\nand secondary studies. An action-oriented, consultative process should be used to elicit the\nviews and suggestions of the agriculture sector stakeholders in preparing the roundtable issue\npapers. Consultations should not be limited to Central Government agencies, but should also\nbe held in different parts of Indonesia, particularly within different regions of Eastern Indonesia\nand with other potential stakeholders, including the private sector and the farmers where\nappropriate.'\n1.\t Roundtable Consultations\n9.
