The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the government of Balochistan (the \ngovernment)  in  public  resource  management  reforms  through  the  Balochistan  Resource \nManagement Program (BRMP I). BRMP I was approved in November 2004,1 and closed after \nthe release of the second tranche on 31 May 2007. In total, BRMP I provided $130 million to \nassist  the  government  of  Balochistan  to  (i)  enhance  provincial  finances  through  fiscal \nrestructuring  and  better  financial  management,  and  (ii)  improve  processes  and  establish \nappropriate institutions for public service delivery and private sector development. In early 2007, \nthe government requested further ADB support to sustain the first phase of reforms. An ADB \nmission visited Quetta and Islamabad during 3\u201312 September 2007 to reach general agreement \non  the  scope  of  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  required  to  prepare  the  second \nBalochistan Resource Management Program (BRMP II).2 The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 presents the initial social and poverty analysis. Details on costs are \nin Appendix 3, with implementation arrangements outlined below. Appendix 4 presents the \noutline terms of reference for the preparation of BRMP II, which will be processed in the second \nquarter of 2008.3\nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Pakistan4 has good governance at its core. This \nemphasis is reflected in ADB\u2019s lending portfolio and several important governance programs \nhave been approved over the last 7 years.5Public resource management\u2014the implementation \nof public policies through fiscal, administrative, and political arrangements\u2014is a key element of \ngovernance  that  has  received  significant  attention  in  recent  years,  particularly  in  light  of \nPakistan\u2019s decentralization reforms, which began in August 2001.   \n3.  BRMP I was successful not only in initiating systemic thinking on strategic reforms in the \ngovernment and with other stakeholders but also in implementing certain fundamental policy \nchanges. Balochistan had an open-ended subsidy system for electricity for operating agricultural \ntube wells, which accounted for about 8% of provincial current expenditure and had increased \nby 150% between fiscal year (FY) 2001 and FY2006. Through BRMP I, the subsidy was capped \nat PRs2 billion in nominal terms (about 5% of provincial expenditure in FY2007). This decision \nwas taken despite the fact that most of the larger landowners, the principal beneficiaries of the \nsubsidy, had considerable political influence. The water resource component of BRMP I has \nprovided a firmer institutional basis for better water resource management through the adoption \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2004.

", "2\nof an integrated water resource management policy\u2014a first in Pakistan. Debt restructuring was \nmade possible by using ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources loan to retire the more expensive cash \ndevelopment loans of the province from the Federal Government, thus saving over PRs1 billion \nper annum in debt servicing costs. Initial revenue management reforms have begun to take \neffect: revenue receipts from tax and nontax sources increased by an impressive 58.2% in \nFY2006  over  the  previous  year,  although  the  increase  in  tax  revenue  was  only  8%.  The \nrecovery of irrigation water charges has picked up under an action plan supported by BRMP I. \nThe \u201cthrow forward\u201d of Balochistan\u2019s public sector development program has been reduced \nunder BRMP reforms.6 Another fundamental policy achievement was the establishment of a \nrule-based transparent system of local government funding. Moving forward, there are three \nsets of constraints. \n4. The fiscal and public financial management reform agenda is incomplete. While\nthe government has taken a number of important steps7 to improve fiscal discipline, further short \nand medium-term reforms are required over the next one to five years to (i) strengthen the \nplanning and budgeting systems, and adopt a medium-term expenditure framework  to enhance \nthe credibility, predictability, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the budgeting process;8\n(ii)  gradually  phase  out  the  remaining  subsidies  that  are  deemed  to  be  inefficient; 9\n(iii)  strengthen  property  and  agriculture  tax  administration,  at  both  provincial  and  local \ngovernment levels; (iv) improve pension administration and contingent liability management;10\nand (v) strengthen accounting, internal control, and audit systems.11\n5. Serious issues remain in institutional and human resource management. BRMP I \nintroduced reforms that enhanced the autonomy of the Public Service Commission, updated the \ngovernment rules of business, and introduced third party audit and pubic grievance redress \nmechanisms. However, the overall number and structure of provincial line departments need to \nbe reviewed. Business processes also need to be improved, particularly in agencies dealing \nwith development and revenue collection, and those with extensive citizen interface. The human \n                                                \n6  A throw forward is the excess of the cost of a development scheme over the current financial year\u2019s allocation, and \nis one of the measures used to analyze the sustainability of the development budget. It provides information on \nhow many years it will take to complete a development scheme, or in how many future budgets the scheme will \nhave to appear. In this case, the throw forward was reduced from almost 10 years in 2004 to 4 years in 2007. \n7  ADB. 2007. Balochistan Resource Management Program Progress Report: Release of Second Tranche. Manila \n(Loans 2107-PAK and 2108-PAK[SF]). Further information on public finance support by other developing partners \ncan be found in government of Balochistan, World Bank, and ADB. 2007. Balochistan Economic Report: From \nPeriphery to Core. Quetta (forthcoming).\n8  BRMP II will continue to strengthen the devolution agenda. Under the Balochistan Local Governance Ordinance, \n2001 the provincial government is no longer a direct implementer exercising complete administrative and financial \ncontrol. Under the ordinance, it is now required to define the policy and regulatory frameworks and ensure they are \nobserved at the local level. This requires a more complex and sophisticated monitoring and analysis role, and \nbuilding capacity at the local level.  \n9  Following the capping of the tube well subsidy under BRMP I, a scheme to phase out the subsidy scheme was \ndeveloped under ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Strengthening Program \nImplementation for Balochistan Resource Management Program. Manila.   \n10There was a fivefold increase in pension and provident fund liabilities between FY1997 and FY2007 with group \ninsurance payments quadrupling over this period\u2013the estimates for FY2007 are PRs943 million (pension liabilities), \nPRs562 million (provident fund liabilities), and PRs100 million (group insurance payments). Draft legislation to set \nup a general provident fund management board to oversee an independent professionally managed fund is \npending in the provincial assembly. \n11For further details see government of Balochistan, World Bank, ADB, Department for International Development \n(DFID), European Commission. 2004. Balochistan. Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment. \nQuetta. The assessment concluded that 21 out of 31 public financial management indicators were weak in \nBalochistan.  ", "3\nresource management regime is outdated and does not encourage or offer incentives for good \nperformance.  Proper  training,  career  management,  and  human  resources  databases  are \nneeded. The difficulty of attracting high-quality civil servants to accept transfers and postings in \nBalochistan  has  to  be  addressed  through  incentive  mechanisms  and  business  process \nimprovements that improve efficiency. \n6. Asset management remains weak. Balochistan\u2019s geography and weather patterns put \nsignificant  pressure  on  its  water  resources.  Ineffective  water  resource  management  and \nmisdirected subsidies have diverted fiscal resources from other high-priority areas. Building on \nprogress made under BRMP I (para. 3 above), the next generation of reforms may include the \ncreation of and support to a water regulatory authority and strengthening of other institutions, \nincluding area water management boards. Strategic planning and monitoring and evaluation \ncapacities in the Irrigation Department are quite weak and need to be further strengthened.  \n7.  Balochistan has a rich cultural heritage and the government is the custodian of one of \nthe most ancient civilizations in human history.12 Proper protection13 and preservation of this \nheritage is essential if it is not to be lost forever. Strategic marketing of Balochistan\u2019s cultural \ntreasures has the potential to bring in additional revenue from raising awareness14 and, if it is \nlinked to the local services industry (e.g., crafts and tourism), it could create jobs. In addition, \nrecognition and promotion of Balochistan\u2019s unique heritage would help to bridge the cultural and \nethnic divides in the province, which would have further dividends in the form of improved law \nand order and private sector growth.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  This project preparatory TA aims to help the government develop the next generation of \npublic administration reforms to be pursued under BRMP II.15 Such continuation and deepening \nof  policy  reforms  in  fiscal  and  financial  management,  public  administration,  and  asset \nmanagement will free resources for pro-poor development and better public service delivery. \nThis in turn is likely to improve the economic and social outcomes in the province. The expected \noutcome is greater fiscal space for the province of Balochistan through enhanced flows and \nimproved management of resources, as further detailed in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). \n9.  These outcomes will be achieved through diagnostic and analytical work under the TA, \nwith wide stakeholder consultations (involving the government, civil society groups, and the \nprivate sector, among others). Several policy papers will be prepared to help formulate the \nreform agenda under BRMP II. The consultative nature of the process will raise awareness and \nbuild capacity to coordinate policy development. \n                                                \n12 The Mehrgarh civilization (located close to Quetta) dates back to at least 7000 Before the Common Era (BCE). \nPreviously the other Indus cultures of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa (which date back to about 3300 BCE) were \nbelieved to be the oldest remnants of South Asia\u2019s past.  \n13Many of the archeological sites are not properly protected and countless precious settlements and grave sites were \nrobbed before scholars were able to examine them. Trade in illicit antiquities is widespread.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n14For instance, major artifacts could be lent to leading museums to generate revenues, which in turn could be \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nearmarked for a museum to be built in Balochistan to ensure that these cultural assets are properly stored and \nexhibited. Such efforts may also contribute to a positive international image of Balochistan.  \n15 For information and research papers produced under BRMP I, see the BRMP website at http://brmp.gob.pk/. ", "4\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will fund (i) national and international experts to undertake studies and policy \nanalysis,  and  to  develop  the  policy  reform  agenda  for  BRMP  II;  and  \n(ii) workshops to promote participation by civil society and other stakeholders and incorporate \ntheir feedback in the policy reform process. The TA will build on recommendations of previous \npolicy-based lending operations and public resource management programs.16\n11.  The studies will also build on the reforms already achieved or initiated under BRMP I \nand  subsequent analytical work such as the first Balochistan Economic Report and Public\nFinancial Management and Accountability Assessment,17 supported by ADB and the World \nBank. The workshops will encourage stakeholders to scrutinize the impact and initial results of \nBRMP I. Outcomes of such workshops/consultations will be published on the BRMP website. \nClose  collaboration  with  other  development  partners  is  also  envisioned  so  that  the  policy \ndialogue under the BRMP II is well coordinated. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will \nprovide $400,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The government \nof Balochistan will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $50,000 equivalent in kind by \nproviding office accommodation, counterpart staff, and facilities for seminars and meetings. \nAppendix 3 presents the cost estimates and financing plan. The government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The Government \nof Pakistan has also been informed of the scope of the TA.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Finance  Department  of  the \ngovernment of Balochistan. Implementing agencies will include the Departments of Planning \nand Development, Excise and Taxation, Board of Revenue, Culture, Irrigation and Services and \nGeneral Administration. The BRMP program management unit will coordinate the TA activities \non behalf of the EA. The TA is expected to begin in January 2008 and will be implemented over \n7  months.  All  consultants  will  prepare  inception  reports  on  their  work  assignments  within            \n4 weeks of the commencement of services. They will also reconfirm the work program and \nestablish time-bound outputs. The consultants will also produce final reports, preceded by \ninterim pieces as appropriate, together with clear recommendation of policy reform measures, \nother proposed activities, and realistic milestones that could be achieved under BRMP II. The \nfinal reports, which will include complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted within 1 \nmonth of the end of the assignment. \n14.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). No major procurement of goods is envisaged under the TA. Supply \ncontracts valued below $10,000 may be directly purchased from the supplier.  \n                                                \n16See for example ADB. 2007.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nPublic  resource  management  deals  with  processes  and  mechanisms  for  mobilizing  revenues  and  allocating  them  to \ndevelopment purposes. Effective public resource management will increase revenues, and improve the allocation efficiency of \npublic expenditures. It will lead to higher socioeconomic returns, improve the access of the poor to public services, and \npromote  private  sector  development  and  employment  generation.  Governance  reforms,  including  public  resource \nmanagement, are a central element of ADB\u2019s country poverty analysis and country strategy and program. BRMP II will \nstrengthen the performance orientation of the budget, free up resources for expenditures on reducing poverty, and improve the \nresponsiveness of the civil service to the public's needs, particularly for the delivery of pro-poor services. \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nPublic resource management programs are governance reforms which indirectly reduce poverty.\nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?\nNo full poverty analysis is required, but the project will consider available poverty assessments in Balochistan. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nNo specific funds will be allocated since the project will build on existing poverty analysis in Balochistan. \n2.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nBRMP II will continue funding performance incentive grants for local governments (as under BRMP I).  An evaluation of the \nsuccess of the grants is currently being undertaken by the Department of Finance of Balochistan. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nThe project intends to improve governance structures in Balochistan.  \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nThe project intends to improve governance structures in Balochistan and is not directly targeting certain beneficiaries.      \n3.
