In December 2012, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) asked the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) during a country programming mission to provide policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for a study on low-carbon development up to 2020.1 ADB \nand the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission \n(CC-NDRC) and the Ministry of Finance agreed later that the TA will help the PRC undertake a \ncritical strategic analysis in assessing the country\u2019s progress towards meeting its country\u2019s \ncarbon intensity reduction targets for 2020.2  \n \n2.  The concept paper was approved on 22 October 2013. During the fact-finding mission in \nOctober 2013, an understanding was reached with the Ministry of Finance and CC-NDRC \nregarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \nagreements, and outline terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Sustained  rapid  economic  growth  and  the  large  part  played  by  energy-intensive \nindustries in its economy have led to a steep rise in energy demand in the PRC. This demand \ngrew from 1.46 billion tons of coal equivalent (btce) in 2000 to 2.97 btce in 2010 and 3.65 btce \nin 2012. Because fossil fuels provide about 90% of primary energy needs, greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions have also increased rapidly, and the PRC is now widely recognized as the \nworld\u2019s largest generator of GHGs.3  \n \n4.  The government has recognized the challenges posed by the rapid expansion in both \nenergy consumption and GHG emissions. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010 set the \ntone for low-carbon development by setting specific targets for energy intensity improvement. In \naddition, the Renewable Energy Law was enacted in 2006 to diversify the energy mix and \nallocate a larger share in it to renewable energy. In 2009, the government announced its 2020 \nlow-carbon goal by committing to reduce carbon intensity by 40%\u201345% by 2020 from the 2005 \nlevel.4 It also aims to increase the share of non-fossil energy in the energy mix to 15% from \nabout 7% during the same period. The government has since adopted a wide range of policy \nmeasures to promote energy conservation and mitigate climate change. These led to a 19.1% \nreduction in energy intensity and rapid growth of non-hydro renewable energy during the 2006\u2013\n2010 period.5  \n \n5.   The Twelfth Five-Year Plan aims to reduce energy intensity by a further 16% and carbon \nintensity by an additional 17% during 2011\u20132015. It also sets a target for increasing the share of \nnon-fossil fuel energy in the overall mix to 11.4% by 2015, up from 7.9% in 2010. In an attempt \nto moderate the demand growth rate, it emphasizes the need for the country to conserve and \nuse energy more carefully. Despite these steps, making the transition from the energy-intensive \n                                                 \n1  The TA was included as the Study on the Key Policies and Actions for China\u2019s Low-Carbon Development towards \n2020 in ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2013.  \n3  GHGs are responsible for climate change. Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide, which is widely \nrecognized as a major GHG. The energy sector accounts for two-thirds of the PRC\u2019s total GHG emissions. \n4  Carbon intensity refers to carbon dioxide emission per unit of gross domestic product. By 2012, the energy intensity \nhad been reduced by more than 24% from the 2005 level.  \n5  The International Energy Agency estimates that this energy intensity reduction has avoided more than 300 million \ntons of coal equivalent consumption in the PRC, thereby avoiding nearly 700 million tons of carbon dioxide \nemissions.  \n ", "2 \ndevelopment of the past to a new low-carbon growth future is proving to be a major challenge \nfor the PRC. This challenge has been complicated by such important external and internal \nfactors as the effects of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, a slower than expected structural \nadjustment toward a more services-oriented economy, and rapid urbanization. The opportunities \nto achieve energy savings at low costs through such steps as the closure of old and inefficient \ncoal-fired power plants and industrial capacity are already being acted upon or have already \nbeen realized. So, the remaining opportunities for further improving energy saving tend to be \nmore complex and expensive. Energy intensity declined by only 2.01% in 2011 and 3.64% in \n2012, the first 2 years of the 12th plan. Carbon intensity remained unchanged in 2011, although \nit  dropped  3.5%  in  2012.  Although  the  PRC  now  boasts  more  wind  power  capacity  than \nanywhere else in the world, integrating it with the grid has presented difficulties that have \nundermined the full low-carbon returns on investments.6 \n \n6.  Despite its large new investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and modern \nindustrial capacity, the PRC\u2019s heavy reliance on fossil fuel continues, and the growth in its GHG \nemissions has not slowed as quickly as planned.7 The critical gaps in the comprehensive \nanalysis, data, and information needed on the readiness of different industries and provinces to \nset and meet stricter low-carbon targets constitute an obstacle to improving these results. \n \n7.  In recognition of these challenges, the PRC is now finalizing the National Plan for \nAddressing  Climate  Change,  2013\u20132020.  The  plan  stresses  the  need  to  address  climate \nchange mitigation, set a cap on total energy consumption, and dramatically reduce carbon \nemission intensity.  Since the PRC\u2019s committed low-carbon goal for 2020 has a range (para. 4), \nit is crucial that this goal be more precisely firmed up preferably towards the higher end of the \nrange. The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for 2016\u20132020 should correspondingly set the right plan \ntarget for carbon intensity reduction to achieve this low-carbon goal. The 13th plan should also \nset up a robust framework of policies, incentives, and regulations for containment and more \naggressive reduction of GHG growth for a much longer period afterwards. To establish the right \nplan target, policies, and actions, the PRC must (i) comprehensively analyze and assess what \nhas worked well so far, as well as the challenges that have emerged that could put attainment of \nthe low-carbon goal seriously at risk; (ii) compare, evaluate, and identify the right mix of policies, \nincentives, and regulation to balance socioeconomic development with energy conservation and \nemission  reduction  during  the  13th  plan;  (iii)  evaluate  the  readiness  of  important  energy-\nintensive sectors and provinces to meet more rigorous carbon intensity reduction target and, if \nneeded,  recommend  a  differentiated  target  mechanism  across  provinces,  industries,  and \neconomic  sectors  to  ensure  its  low-cost  achievement;  and  (iv)  study  an  nationwide \nimplementation mechanism for low-carbon target setting, monitoring, and verification during the \nplan period. \n \n8.  The significance of achieving the PRC\u2019s 2020 low-carbon goal to global climate change \nmanagement cannot be emphasized enough. The proposed TA will help carry out the critical \nanalyses and formulate the appropriate recommendations for the 13th plan. It is closely aligned \nwith the ADB country partnership strategy for 2011\u20132015, which makes the environmental \nsustainability  of  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  development  a  priority.  The TA  outputs  may  directly \ncontribute to the government\u2019s policy making and carbon emission control programs during the \n                                                 \n6  The installed wind power capacity in the PRC was about 62 gigawatts in 2012, which is higher than the second \nranked United States, but electricity generation from wind power in the PRC was only one-half that of the United \nStates.  \n7   Based on an estimate by Tsinghua University, the PRC will need more than CNY3.00 trillion in investments in \nenergy conservation and renewable energy during the 12th plan period, compared with about CNY1.75 trillion in  \ninvestments during the 11th plan period.   \n ", "  3\n13th plan and beyond. The TA may provide critical knowledge work that can be utilized in \nsimilar studies across other major emerging economies in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be to firm up the PRC\u2019s 2020 low-carbon goal and its timely \nachievement. The outcome will be the adoption of the appropriate carbon intensity reduction \ntarget in the 13th plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA outputs will be (i) assessment through studies of the opportunities for and the \nchallenges to achieving the 2020 low-carbon goal; (ii) preparation of a report on carbon intensity \ntarget setting for the 13th plan and a breakdown of targets across economic sectors and \nprovinces; (iii) an economic comparison of emission control policy tools and recommendations \non the most appropriate mix of policies; and (iv) implementation guidelines and a framework for \nthe 13th plan\u2019s carbon intensity reduction target.  \n \n11.  During its initial stages, the TA will establish a stakeholder\u2019s network of experts from \nvarious  sectors  of  the  economy  and  government  agencies.  Close  coordination  will  be \nmaintained  throughout  implementation  with  the  executing  agency  and  the  stakeholders  to \nensure that the TA takes into account previous studies, government priorities, existing plans, \nand the results of complementary projects. The TA will also support study of international \nexperience in market-based carbon-reduction instruments and policies that have worked well in \nsome developed countries, such as a carbon tax, emission trading schemes, and emission \nperformance standards, and examine their relevance to the PRC and the country\u2019s readiness for \ntheir introduction.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,100,000, of which (i) $800,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources), \nand (ii) $150,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.8 The executing \nagency will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nsecretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  CC-NDRC  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  will  provide  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation and facilities, and transport for site visits, as required. CC-NDRC will establish \na steering committee of high-level experts in the climate change area from academia, relevant \nministries, and the research body of the State Council to oversee TA implementation and \nprovide guidance on the TA outputs.  \n \n14.  The TA will need about 102 person-months of national consulting services. The outline \nterms of reference and the types of expertise required from the team of consultants are in \n                                                 \n8  Established by ADB. \n ", "4 \nAppendix 3. ADB, in consultation with the executing agency, will select and engage national \nconsultants through a consulting firm using the 90%\u201310% weighted quality- and cost-based \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The consulting firm will be required to submit a simplified technical \nproposal covering all aspects of the terms of reference. Any procurement of goods and services \nduring  the  TA  implementation  using  TA  resources  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n15.   The TA will require extensive hands-on knowledge of and experience in dealing with the \nPRC\u2019s  low-carbon  policies,  actions,  and  programs,  as  well  as  a  deep  understanding  of \nconditions in the economies in the country\u2019s various economic sectors and provinces. This \nmakes national consultants the most appropriate choice to undertake the core TA tasks. It is \nexpected  that  experienced  consultants  will  be  engaged  from  major  research  institutes, \nacademia, and knowledge centers to help carry out the TA tasks. \n \n16.  To supplement the work of the national consultants, high-level roundtables, workshops, \nand seminars will be organized to which well-known international experts and representatives of \ninternational research institutes and government agencies from developed countries will be \ninvited to share knowledge on all key topics. These meetings will make it possible to incorporate \nthe results of an exchange of ideas and brainstorming on critical issues and the lessons and \nbest practices from developed countries in the TA recommendations. ADB and the executing \nagency will cooperate closely in organizing and managing these gatherings.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 19-month period from 15 January 2014 to 15 August \n2015. The consultants will be required to submit TA deliverables and progress reports on time. \nDetailed requirements for deliverables and reports are included in the outline terms of reference \nfor consultants in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.
