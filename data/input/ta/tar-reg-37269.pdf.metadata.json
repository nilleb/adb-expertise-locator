The Government-owned railway in Cambodia consists of two routes, the 254 kilometer \n(km) southern line connecting Phnom Penh with the port at Sihanoukville, and the 385 km \nnorthern line connecting Phnom Penh with the Thai rail network at the border town of Poipet. \nThe network was severely damaged during the 1970s and, although it still operates, the level of \nservice is extremely low. The link between the northern line and the Thai network, about 50 km \nlong, has been completely removed. \n2.  This  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)1  will  prepare  a  project  to \nrehabilitate the railway\u2019s infrastructure, reconstruct the link to Thailand, construct a new track to \nconnect the railway with the container terminal in Sihanoukville Port, and construct two new \ncrossing  loops  to  improve  operations.  The  PPTA  is  associated  with  an  advisory  technical \nassistance (ADTA), being processed and to be implemented concurrently, that will assist the \nGovernment  with  restructuring  the  railway  subsector  and  establishing  a  new  public-private \npartnership (PPP) to operate the rehabilitated railway. Subject to the rehabilitation project\u2019s \nviability, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners may provide \nsupport for physical rehabilitation of the railway\u2019s infrastructure, since this cannot be financed by \nthe private sector on commercial conditions, nor by the Government or the railway itself for lack \nof resources. The rehabilitation investment and the associated restructuring will together set the \nstage for efficient rail freight services, which in turn will realize the project's objectives: improving \nthe transport sector's efficiency by increasing the diversity of transport modes and routes, and \nresurrecting the railway on a sustainable basis. \n3.  The Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study (CTSSS),2 which was completed in \nDecember 2002, concluded that a rehabilitated railway would be economically beneficial to \nCambodia and could become a profitable operation. The strategy study recommended further \nevaluation of the case for rehabilitation of the railway. In May 2003, a Reconnaissance Mission \nfrom ADB visited Cambodia and Thailand to review the possibilities for rehabilitation of the \nrailway  reestablishing  its  connection  with  the  railway  in  Thailand.  The  Mission  found  that \nrehabilitation of the railway would be realistic and relevant, provided the railway as an institution \nwas restructured. \n4.  During the country programming mission in 2003, the Government requested inclusion of \na loan for restructuring and rehabilitating the railway, and an associated grant-financed technical \nassistance (TA) in ADB\u2019s 2004 country strategy and plan update. In response, ADB provided \ntwo small-scale TA studies in October 2003, one to assess the potential market for the railway \nand the other to provide an indication of physical rehabilitation requirements. The market study \nconfirmed substantial potential demand, especially if the route to Thailand is reopened, and also \nconfirmed  that  improved  rail  transport  would  generate  substantial  economic  benefits  from \nreduced future transport cost and road maintenance cost by diverting heavy goods traffic away \nfrom the road network. The study also confirmed that the railway would become profitable, \nprovided investments are limited to those necessary to allow efficient freight traffic and to \nreconnect the railway with Thailand. The study concluded by recommending restructuring of the \nrailway to enable private sector investment to reduce the requirements for Government-financed \ncapital expenditure. The study also documented that there were private investors who would be \ninterested in operating the rehabilitated railway. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 February 2004. \n2  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study. \nManila (TA 3651-CAM, approved by the President on 27 April 2001 for $850,000). \n ", "2   \n5.  In June 2004, the Government and ADB agreed on the broad approach to development \nof  a  project  for  restructuring  and  rehabilitating  the  railway.  Restructuring  would  involve \nestablishing a public-private partnership (PPP) with the Government as minority shareholder to \ntake  over  future  railway  operations,  and  creating  an  independent  regulatory  authority. \nRehabilitation would restore the railway\u2019s fixed infrastructure. The infrastructure and all land \nwould remain in Government ownership. In a related event, in late 2004, the Government of \nMalaysia committed reclaimed rail3 from the upgrading of its national railway for reconstruction \nof the line to the border with Thailand. On 9\u201311 March 2005, an ADB TA Fact-Finding Mission \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and costs for the PPTA to prepare the rehabilitation component of the proposed \nproject. The understanding was recorded in an aide memoire that was subsequently confirmed \nin a letter from the Minister of Public Works and Transport, dated 31 March 2005. \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  The CTSSS concluded that the railway in Cambodia is worn-out and requires extensive \nphysical  and  institutional  rehabilitation  to  regain  financial  and  technical  sustainability.  The \nrailway is currently incurring losses and neither the Government nor the railway can finance \nrehabilitation from its own resources. \n7.  Cambodia's transport system is economically inefficient due to a limited choice of routes \nand modes of transport, which severely limits the scope for optimizing logistics, and permits the \nformation of cartels by transport providers and the exploitation of natural monopolies by private \nand public owners and operators of infrastructure. The enabling environment for these market \nfailures is the physical and regulatory barriers4 that reduce the diversity of routes and modes \navailable\u2014often to only a single realistic choice\u2014and effectively lock transport buyers into \ninefficient or overpriced services for lack of alternatives. As a result of these inefficiencies, as \nwell as others that are not transport related, staple commodities on which the poor rely are \nsignificantly more expensive in Cambodia than in the neighboring countries, and Cambodia\u2019s \nnascent export industries\u2014garments and tourism, which are the prime generators of new jobs \nand  foreign  currency\u2014are  threatened  because  their  international  competitiveness  is  being \nundermined  by  formal  and  informal  transaction  costs,  inclusive  of  overpriced  or  inefficient \ndomestic transport services. The scope for further diversifying the economy into other sectors \nsuch as agro-industry and assembly is correspondingly diminished. \n8.  A  small-scale  market  study  undertaken  in  October  2003  showed  that  widening  the \ndiversity of transport services and the number of external linkages would provide transport users \nwith  alternatives  to  overpriced  services  and  increase  the  inherent  economic  efficiency  of \ntransport  supply  by  providing  a  broader  spectrum  of  routes  and  modes.  This would  allow \ntransport users to better tailor logistic solutions to their needs. For example, consumer prices for \nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is used for cooking in households, is about 65% higher in \nCambodia than in Thailand partly because LPG at present cannot be imported in bulk. \n9.  The proposed project aims to reduce consumer prices and increase the growth potential \nof  Cambodia's  economy  by  increasing  the  inherent  efficiency  of  domestic  transport  and \nreducing the barriers that sustain monopoly pricing in the transport sector. The proposed project \n                                                 \n3  The memorandum of understanding between the two governments estimates the value of the track at $8 million. \n4  Examples are the missing railway connection to Thailand, which was dismantled in the 1970s; and the ban on \ntrucks crossing Cambodia\u2019s borders, which means that all trade across the land borders must be off-loaded and \nmoved by pushcart before being reloaded on the other side. \n ", "  3\nwill also have immediate subregional impact by relinking the railway in Cambodia with the \nrailway in Thailand and then with the network in Malaysia and Singapore. The TA and the \nensuing loan project have been included in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) regional \ncountry program and strategy (RCSP) pipeline since they support the strategic thrusts of the \nRCSP: (i) strengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-border movements and tourism, and \n(ii) integrating national markets to promote economic efficiency and private sector development. \nThe recently concluded Second GMS Summit in Kunming endorsed widening GMS cooperation \nin transport to include the rail, air, and water transport subsectors. Looking further forward, \nconnecting this greater network with the existing railway network in Viet Nam, and through it to \nthe network in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), will provide a rail-based transport corridor \nbetween Singapore and the PRC. The economic potential for such a corridor, which would \nrequire a new rail link between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam, is presently \nunder study. The proposed railway project is also a priority project in cooperation programs of \nGMS and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The goals of the project are to support economic growth by improving Cambodia's \ninternational competitiveness, and support poverty reduction by reducing the cost of living. The \npurposes of the project are to (i) increase the efficiency of the transport sector at large by \nincreasing the competitiveness of the railway, (ii) secure the long-term sustainability of the \nrailway sector, and (iii) reduce road damage and road traffic risks associated with the movement \nof  heavy  and  dangerous  goods.  The  project  will  achieve  these  goals  by  restructuring  the \nrailway,  for  which  an  associated  ADTA  is  being  provided,  and  rehabilitating  the  railway\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  which  will  connect  it  to  the  railway  in  Thailand  and  the  container  port  in \nSihanoukville. The rehabilitated railway will be primarily for freight traffic, but it will continue to \nprovide limited passenger service. The proposed PPTA described here is for the rehabilitation \ncomponent of the project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11.  The outcome of the PPTA will be a well-prepared project for rehabilitating the railway to \naccommodate  freight  and  limited  passenger  traffic,  with  a  mainline  speed  of  at  least  50 \nkilometers per hour; and connecting the railway in Cambodia with the railway in Thailand and \nthe container port (km/h) in Sihanoukville. The rehabilitated infrastructure will be the basis for \nthe concession to a PPP to maintain the railway and operate its freight services. The operating \narrangements for the passenger service will be defined and agreed upon under the associated \nADTA. Subject to the outcome of the restructuring ADTA, it is likely that a railway operator will \nbe established as a joint venture between a selected consortium of private investors and the \nGovernment of Cambodia as minority shareholder. The railway\u2019s infrastructure and land will \nremain the Government\u2019s property. In this model, it is envisaged that the operator will pay a \nlease for use of the railway\u2019s land and infrastructure which, with the Government\u2019s share of \nprofits from the operator, will suffice to service the loans for rehabilitating the infrastructure. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  project  will  rehabilitate  about  600  km  of  existing  railway  track  and  associated \nstructures;  reconstruct  48  km  of  track  between  Sisophon  and  Poipet  on  the  border  with \nThailand, using the old railway embankment and reclaimed track donated by the Government of \nMalaysia;  construct  a  new  spur  (about  2  km)  to  the  container  port  in  Sihanoukville;  and \nconstruct two new crossing loops to improve operations. Significant resettlement will only be \n ", "4   \nrequired at a few locations covering less than about 2% of the railway\u2019s total length. The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n13.  The key activities of the PPTA are to (i) prepare preliminary designs for the rehabilitation \nwork, in sufficient detail for determining the economic viability of the rehabilitation program; \n(ii) execute environmental assessment and prepare mitigation plans as required; (iii) prepare \nresettlement plans; (iv) assess social and ethnic minority impacts and prepare mitigation or \nenhancement plans as required; and (v) assess the economic feasibility of rehabilitation based \non  traffic  studies  and  projections  prepared  under  the  associated  restructuring  ADTA.  The \nproject\u2019s financial analysis will also be carried out under the ADTA.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent comprising $430,000 in \nforeign exchange and $160,000 in local currency equivalent. ADB will provide $430,000 of the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $70,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment has agreed to finance local currency expenditures for $90,000 in kind. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport will be the Executing Agency. The PPTA will \nbe implemented by an international firm of consultants engaged by ADB to provide engineering \ndesign, environmental and resettlement assessment and mitigation planning, and economic \nanalysis.  The  international  firm  will  execute  the  consultancy  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants over 8 months, October 2005\u2013May 2006, and will provide 15 person-months of \ninternational consulting services, and 6 person-months of domestic consultant input. Outline \nterms of reference are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be engaged by ADB through quality- \nand cost-based selection using simplified technical proposals in accordance with its Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The TA will be implemented over a 16\u2013month period commencing in August 2005 \nand ending in December 2006. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion: Rehabilitation of the \nRailway in Cambodia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nInfrastructure that is created  Rehabilitated railway  Project completion reports  \u2022  The railway is \nwill allow profitable, long-term  connected to the railway in  restructured. \nrailway operations,  Thailand and the port in   \nconnecting the capital of  Sihanoukville \nCambodia to the Thai border   \nand to the port in \nSihanoukville. \nOutcome      Assumption \nRegular and efficient railway  The railway captures 80% of  Road traffic surveys and  \u2022  The railway is \nfreight traffic  the freight market for bulk  traffic statistics from the  competitive. \nRoad damage and road  products between the capital  railway   \ntraffic risks reduced  to Sihanoukville and   \nThailand. \nAll dangerous cargoes (fuel, \nliquefied petroleum gas, \nchemicals) and at least half \nof all bulk cargo transports on \nNational Road 4 and 5 are \ndiverted to rail. \nOutputs      Assumptions \nA rehabilitated permanent  The railway is rehabilitated  Project reporting, railway  1.

Introduction \n1.  The Government of Cambodia intends to rehabilitate its railway\u2019s infrastructure. The \nGovernment  desires  to  procure  a  firm  of  consulting  engineers  to  advise  and  assist  the \nGovernment  with  preparing  the  project.  In  parallel  with  rehabilitation  of  the  railway,  the \nGovernment also intends to restructure the railway sector. This will be carried out under a \nseparate but associated restructuring advisory technical assistance (ADTA). \nB.  Objectives \n2.  The objective of the consulting assignment is to advise and assist the Government with \nall aspects of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the infrastructure of the two existing railway \nlines from Phnom Penh to Poipet and from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville. The total length of the \nrailway  is  about  650  kilometers  (km)  of  which  about  600  km  is  existing  track  that  needs \nrehabilitation, about 48 km needs reconstruction in an existing alignment, and about 2 km will be \nnew construction. The consultant will do the following: \n(i)  Prepare preliminary engineering design and procurement documents suitable for \nsubsequent  tendering  on  a  design-and-construct  basis  for  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of the railway\u2019s track and associated structures. \n(ii)  Assess environmental, resettlement, and social impacts of the project; perform \nconsultations  with  stakeholders;  and  prepare  all  required  documentation  and \nmitigation plans. \n(iii)  Perform economic analysis of the proposed project inclusive of distributional \nanalysis. The analysis will be based on traffic forecast and other projections \nprepared under the associated restructuring ADTA. Financial analysis will not be \ncarried  out  but  the  results  of  the  financial  analysis  performed  under  the \nrestructuring ADTA will be referenced and commented upon as relevant.1 \nC.  Detailed Tasks \n1.  Preliminary Engineering Design \n3.  The railway is single track\u2013meter gauge. There are two lines: the northern line between \nPhnom Penh and Poipet, which was built in the 1930s using 30 kilograms/meter (kg/m) rail on \nsteel sleepers, with a design speed of 70 km/hour (h) and a maximum axle load of 15 tons; and \nthe southern line between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, which was built in the 1960s using \n43 kg/m rails on wooden sleepers, with a design speed of 90 km/h and a maximum axle load of \n30 tons. The mainline track is approximately 650 km. At construction there were 103 steel \nbridges (total length 2,733 m), 169 concrete bridges (total length 4,026 m), 716 culverts and 33 \nstations with crossing loops. There are no tunnels and all road crossings are level. War action \nhas severely damaged the railway\u2019s infrastructure, notably bridges where about one third are \ndestroyed or severely damaged. The last 48 km of the northern line, toward the border with \nThailand, was demolished in the 1970s. Unexploded ordnance and mines must be removed \nbefore construction.  \n4.  The project will include rehabilitation or, where necessary, replacement of all existing \nbridges and culverts, rehabilitation of the existing track (about 600 km), and reconstruction of \nthe missing section on the old alignment (about 48 km). The project will also provide an \n                                                 \n1  The traffic analysis and the financial analysis under the restructuring ADTA will be available by the end of \nNovember 2005. \n ", "10  Appendix 4 \nalternative design for realignment of approximately 10 km of the missing section of the northern \nline at the Thai border crossing, to a new border crossing point, the location of which is \npresently under discussion; design of about 2 km of new siding to connect the southern line to \nthe container port in Sihanoukville, and two new crossing loops on the northern line to improve \nfuture operations. The rehabilitation project will generally retain the original design standards \nexcept  for  the  mainline  design  speed  which  will  be  a  minimum  50  km/h\u2013and  the  loading \nstandard\u2013which will meet current standards in Thailand. The rehabilitated railway will primarily \ncarry  freight  traffic,  but  it  may  also  provide  a  limited  passenger  service.  Signaling, \ncommunications, all freight-related rolling stock, and auxiliary equipment with associated repair \nand maintenance facilities will be provided by the future railway operator, and will be included in \nthe scope of the rehabilitation project.
