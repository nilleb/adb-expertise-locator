During  the  October  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)1 from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare a loan and Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant-\nfinanced project for the Shaanxi-Qinling Mountains Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. \nAfter receiving ADB Management\u2019s endorsement of the concept for this TA, the Fact-Finding \nMission in March 2005 held discussions with the government of Shaanxi province (SP), and \nreached an understanding on the detailed objectives, scope, cost estimates, terms of reference \nfor  consultants,  and  financing  and  implementation  arrangements  to  prepare  the  project. \nSubsequently, the Government requested that the ADB TA and the proposed GEF component \nbe  separated. 2  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  support  the  SP  government  in  preparing  a  biodiversity \nconservation and tourism development project at Louguantai in the Qinling Mountains. The \nproject is environmental category B and will entail the preparation of an initial environmental \nevaluation. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Qinling Mountain (QM) range is located immediately to the south of Xi\u2019an, the \nprovincial capital, and runs east west straddling the southern part of SP, in the western region of \nthe PRC. It is biologically rich and globally significant, with many endangered rare and/or \nendemic plant and animal species. The best known of these is the giant panda, and also has \nthe only known wild population of one of the world\u2019s rarest birds, the crested ibis (national bird of \nJapan). The mountains are characterized by very high levels of endemic biodiversity found in \ntemperate and subtropical ecosystems, as well as a vertical spectrum of vegetation types; 70% \nof all vegetation types in the PRC are found here.3 The range forms the dividing line between \nthe south and north of the country, and has a major climatic influence on northern PRC, and the \nwater resources of both the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The southern slopes are a major water \nsource for the middle line of the South to North Water Transfer Project, and contribute over 50% \nof water stored in the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Yangtze River. The northern slopes supply \nwater to the Yellow River system, which flows to the dry northern parts of the country. Over 90% \nof the range lies within SP, and 70% of the total range (about 40,000 square kilometers (km2) of \nthe total range area of about 57,000 km2) has been highly degraded due to inappropriate \nfarming,  logging,  overuse  of  natural  resources,  destructive  mining  operations,  as  well  as \n                                                 \n1  Previously titled Technical Assistance for Preparing the Shaanxi Qinling Integrated Ecosystem Management \nProject and the Ningxia Yinchuan Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. Following the Government\u2019s request \nin June 2005, it was divided into two separate TAs. The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet \nedition) on 18 April 2005. \n2  Given the important opportunity that this project presents in addressing globally significant biodiversity issues in the \nQinling Mountain (QM) range, both the Government and ADB recognize the need for this project preparatory TA to \nclosely collaborate with the planned application of the GEF grant by the Government for the QM range. In this \ncontext, the Government confirmed that it will enable close collaboration between ADB\u2019s TA team and the team \nresponsible for preparing the GEF grant,  which, if obtained, will be made available for the ADB project (para. 15). \n3  The QM contain many of the world\u2019s highly endangered animal, bird and plant species. Over 15 animal species \nhave been listed by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the national priority protection wildlife list, including the giant \npanda, golden takin, golden snub-nosed monkey, brown-eared pheasant, crested ibis, red panda, clouded leopard, \nand  giant  salamander.  The  QM  contains  the  highest  giant  panda  population  in  the  PRC,  being  home  to \napproximately 40% the total wild panda population. Many important plant species are endemic (1,428 species), \nrelic, rare or endangered, including the ginkgo, one of the oldest tree species in the world. The Chinese mountain \nlarch, oneflower kingdonia, the important source-species of the cultivated paeony, the Mao-tai maple, and the \nChinese fir are also highly endangered and therefore listed by the Government as protected species.  \n \n \n ", "2   \npollution from solid waste and agrochemicals over many decades. As a result, water resources \nare in serious decline. \n  \n3.  The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) nominated the Qinling Mountains \nEcosystem Function Area (QMEFCA) as a national pilot program in 2001. The area contains 19 \nnature reserves, but many of these are inadequately financed and lack modern management. \nThe  SP  government  in  2003  recognized  the  QM  as  a  national-class  ecological  function \nprotected zone, and approved the Shaanxi-QM ecological function protected zone plan. Further, \nin June 2003, the SP government issued notification of special measures for the northern \nfootslopes of the QM, which aimed to prosecute violators of the laws and regulations for eco-\nenvironmental protection. Many illegal mining sites have been closed, some existing tourist sites \nhave been rejuvenated, cultivation on slopes exceeding 25 degrees has been banned, the \nenvironmental impact assessment of proposed projects has been reexamined, polluters and \nillegal loggers have been fined, and vegetation belts have been established. \n \n4.  Approximately 4.9 million people live within the overall QM range. Poverty is widespread, \nwith pervasive small-scale agriculture on steep slopes, very limited infrastructure throughout the \nrugged and isolated valleys, with few links to the modern economy. In 2004, the average annual \nincome of urban residents was CNY5,928 ($733.2 ) while the average annual per capita income \nof the rural population was only CNY1,050  ($129.9), or 35% of the poverty level on a $1/day \nbasis.  Although  many  government  agencies have  responsibility  for  delivering  services  and \nprojects for water and soil conservation, agriculture and livestock, conservation and natural \nresource management and social services, there is no strategy for combating land degradation \nor promoting sustainable development. SP is world-class in using a market approach to create \nwealth from its history and culture; e.g., in 2002, Xi\u2019an with its excellent ancient architecture, \nmuseums, hotels, and sophisticated tourism services received 19.7 million tourists, of whom \n0.74 million were from overseas. The terracotta warriors site alone earned the equivalent of $25 \nmillion from 1.9 million tourists, which is expanding at about 10% annually. However, SP has yet \nto capitalize on its wonderful potential for tourism related to the unique collection of plants, \nanimals, and birds that live in and around the QM.4 There is an outstanding opportunity to \npromote conservation-based tourism linked to the growing domestic and international demand \nat sites such as that of the terracotta warriors, and to create employment and wealth in the QM \nfor the future promotion of sustainable conservation. \n \n5.  The main project site is located in Zhouzhi County, between the Tianyu River and the \nChiyu River, on hilly land south of provincial road S107. It is about 1-hour drive on excellent \nroads south of Xi\u2019an. The core area of approximately 458 km2 is on the site of the existing \nLouguantai Historical and Cultural Area. It is bounded by a small existing zoo/animal clinic with \nrare  animals  (giant  panda,  golden  monkey,  crested  ibis,  etc.)  that  is  currently  under \nreconstruction, and an existing botanical garden with a large collection of bamboo species and \nother native and introduced plants. Currently, the existing botanical garden attracts 200,000 \nvisitors and in 2004 generated CNY6 million. In 2004, 30,000 visitors went to the existing \nzoo/clinic and generated CNY300,000. An additional 100,000 visitors went to the ancient Tao \ntemples and other cultural sites in the vicinity, free of charge. \n \n                                                 \n4  The terracotta warriors near Xi\u2019an, the eighth wonder of the world, and other cultural sites, represent the world \nstandard. The best sites attract a steadily growing number of domestic and international tourists, are profitable, and \nhave a guaranteed future from internally generated funds. However, biodiversity conservation is not similarly \npresented to international standards and, therefore remains heavily dependent on limited public finance.    \n ", "  3\n6.  The project will pursue a market-driven approach to biodiversity conservation, featuring \ncommercial tourism and sustainable land management, and well-managed conservation. It will \ndevelop  a  modern  biodiversity  conservation,  tourism,  and  education  facility  at  Louguantai; \npolicy/strategy and institutional capacity building for the site; habitat restoration; sustainable \nlivelihood; and a modern system of ecosystem monitoring. The project will demonstrate modern \nbest practices and commercial management and will foster potential links throughout the wider \nQinling range to support rural economic development, conservation, and poverty reduction. \nAppendix 1 describes the proposed project. \n \n7.  Related programs and projects that will offer valuable links and potential collaboration \nwith the project include the ongoing PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland \nEcosystems,  and  the  GEF/ADB-financed  Capacity  Building  to  Combat  Land  Degradation \nProject, that is ongoing in six western region provinces/autonomous regions including SP.5 The \nWorld Bank has undertaken previous conservation investments in the QM, and is implementing \nother  projects  in  the  PRC  that  promote  sustainable  land  management  and  biodiversity \nconservation (e.g., the Gansu-Xinjiang Pastoral Development Project, $66.25 million loan and \n$10.5 million GEF grant). ADB\u2019s 2006\u20132008 program includes six projects that are anticipated \nto involve a combination of loans and GEF grants for related efforts to promote sustainable \nnatural resources management.6 \n \n8.  The PRC\u2019s western region shares a common border with several of the Central Asian \nrepublics; to the south, a common border is shared with the countries of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS).  Land  degradation  has  serious  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nconsequences in all these countries. As in the PRC, the causes of land degradation are multiple \nand  complex,  but  are  largely  attributable  to  overexploitation  of  the  natural  resource  base \nthrough unsustainable agricultural practices, overgrazing, deforestation, and natural disasters. \nLessons from the project, especially the commercial approach to biodiversity conservation and \necotourism, will be relevant to operations in Central Asia, the GMS, and elsewhere.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  Shaanxi-Qinling  Mountains  Integrated  Ecosystem  Management \nProject will be improved biodiversity conservation and reduced land degradation. To achieve \nthis impact, the TA will design an investment project for the establishment of a commercially \nsustainable initiative for biodiversity conservation and tourism at Louguantai. The TA will have \nthe following outputs: (i) an assessment of the enabling conditions for the Louguantai site, \nincluding policies, regulations, and incentives; (ii) appropriate institutional arrangements for the \nproject, including those for capacity building; (iii) design of the Louguantai facility and core area \n(approximately  458  km2)  as  a  commercial  venue  for  biodiversity  conservation,  education, \nscientific  display  and  research,  and  ecological  and  cultural  tourism;  and  (iv)  ecosystem \nmonitoring to gauge the impact of conservation, tourism and land degradation  control. A design \n                                                 \n5  TA 4357(G), Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project, approved on 29 June 2004 for $13.8 million, \nof which $7.7 million was provided by GEF as a grant. It is supported by ADB-financed TA 4358 to Support \nImplementation of the Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project, for $1.2 million.  \n6  Country Strategy and Program Update, May 2005. \n7 Two similar GEF-supported initiatives in Central Asia are (i) United Nation\u2019s Environment Programme\u2019s Sustainable \nLand Management Project in the High Pamir and Pamir-Alai Mountains - an Integrated and Transboundary \nInitiative; and (ii) ADB\u2019s project Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management. The Biodiversity Corridors \nConservation Initiative is a new ADB regional TA project under preparation in the GMS countries. \n ", "4   \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and Appendix 2 gives the initial poverty and social \nanalysis.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The key activities of the TA are (i) review and analysis of the enabling conditions, \nincluding policies, regulations, and incentives for sustainable development of the Louguantai \nsite; (ii) institutional arrangements, including public/private roles and partnerships, and capacity \nbuilding; (iii) design of the core area investment at Louguantai, inclusive of best international \npractices for business management and strategy for different market segments; identification of \nspecies  of  global  importance,  habitat  restoration,  scientific  research  and  displays,  small \nzoo/animal  hospital/breeding  center,  ecological  and  cultural  tourism,  species  protection \n(animals, birds, and plants), laboratories, conservation education for the general public, sewage \nand waste treatment facilities; access roads (approx. 55 km) and cableway (1.2 km); riverbank \nprotection (2.6 km), power plant, telecommunications, vehicles, equipment and related facilities; \nand (iv) monitoring and evaluation to gauge the impact of restoring and protecting natural \necosystem functions, biodiversity conservation, combating land degradation and tourism. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 equivalent, comprising $255,000 in \nforeign exchange and $445,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide assistance in the \namount of $500,000 for the TA financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program, \nincluding $255,000 to cover the foreign exchange cost and $245,000 equivalent for the local \ncurrency. The Government will provide $200,000 equivalent of local costs, to cover in-kind \ncounterpart costs and services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Foreign Loan Support Project Management Office under the SP Government\u2019s \nDevelopment Reform Commission (SPDRC) will be the Executing Agency. A leading group (LG) \nwill be chaired by the responsible vice-governor, and coordinate involved agencies to ensure \nsmooth implementation and act as a steering committee. The director general of the SPDRC will \nhead a standing office to be set up under the LG. The office will (i) report to the LG, (ii) organize \nLG meetings (at least 3 times during the TA), (iii) oversee institutional coordination, (iv) review \nwork programs and expenditures, and (v) liaise with central Government agencies and ADB. \nThe project management office (PMO) will be established to provide administration support. The \nPMO will have expertise in plant and animal biology, economics, finance, tourism, marketing, \nlegal and regulatory aspects, and information technology. PMO responsibilities will include (i) \nwork plan development, (ii) administrative support, (iii) financial management, (iv) support for \nLG meetings, (v) information dissemination, and (vi) regular liaison with involved agencies. The \nPMO will engage 8-10 permanent staff and link closely to the existing group of the Qinling \nBotanical Garden. An expert panel (6-8 members) will advise the PMO and consultants and will \nbe paid an honorarium. \n \n13.  The TA will be carried out over 8 months from March 2006 to November 2006. ADB will \nfinance  50  person-months  (11  international  and  39  domestic)  of  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants  will  work  as  a  team  under  the  overall  leadership  of  the  international  team \nleader/biodiversity conservation and tourism specialist. The international consultants will have \nexpertise in best international practices with respect to biodiversity conservation management \nand tourism, and project economics and finance. The domestic consultants will have expertise \n ", "  5\nin biodiversity conservation, business development and marketing, tourism, social development, \nenvironmental  assessment,  civil  engineering,  project  economics  and  finance,  and  data \ncoordination. Terms of reference are in Appendix 4. ADB will engage a firm in accordance with \nits  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. The process will follow ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod, with simplified technical proposal procedures. The consultants will  procure equipment \nfor the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n14.  At the end of the first month, the consultant team will submit an inception report and \nseminar and workshop plan to the Government and ADB, which will be discussed in a tripartite \nreview meeting. A midterm report will be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of \nthe fourth month from the start of the TA, the findings of which will be discussed in a seminar or \nworkshop, with stakeholders as participants, in a second tripartite review meeting. A draft final \nreport (10 copies) to be submitted to the Government and ADB 1 month before the end of the \nassignment, will be presented by the consultant in the second seminar. A third tripartite review \nmeeting will be held before the conclusion of the TA to discuss the draft final report. Comments \ngenerated during the second seminar will be incorporated into the final report in English and in \nChinese (10 copies each), to be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of the 8 \nmonths TA implementation. \n \n15.  The proposed GEF-financed project that will be prepared separately will address global \nenvironmental impacts. It may include the design of the following measures within a future GEF \ngrant-financed  investment  to  complement  the  ADB  loan-financed  baseline  project:  (i)  an \nanalysis  of  the  enabling  conditions,  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements,  and  \ndevelopment of a strategy for sustainable land management in the wider QM; (ii) promotion of \nthe national program of Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas (EFCA) within the QM; (iii) \nsupport for existing and new nature reserves, including the Louguantai site, and institutional \ncapacity and financial mechanisms needed to support them to achieve global environmental \nbest practices; (iv) an outreach program, linking the Louguantai facility and the wider QM, \npromotion  of  sustainable  livelihood  activities  and  conservation;  and  (v)  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system.  The  GEF-financed  project  will  also  support  the  potential \nreplication/modification of the market-based approach at Louguantai in other reserves in more \nperipheral areas. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Shaanxi-Qinling Mountains \nIntegrated Ecosystem Management Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators1  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved biodiversity  No biodiversity species  Survey results compared  (cid:131)  Project design is \nconservation, increased  lost, increased   with the baseline  implemented \ntourism and reduction in  distribution of endemic    effectively. \nland degradation   species, improved carbon    (cid:131)  Government and \n  sequestration    Asian Development \n    Bank (ADB) sign loan \nAll degraded land   Survey results compared  agreement. \nrecovered in the  with the baseline   \nLouguantai core area    Risks \n(approx. 458 square    (cid:131)  Government priorities \nkilometers [km2])     change, or \n    Government is \nIncreased tourism and  Tourism receipts and  reluctant to accept \ncommercial viability of the  statistics; financial  the recommended \nLouguantai facility   analysis of Louguantai  design measures. \n  tourism facility  (cid:131)  Lack of tourists.

Ongoing ADB-\nfinanced policy work is addressing poverty-related issues in health, education, social protection, nutrition, natural \nresources and biodiversity conservation, agriculture, land degradation, access to clean drinking water, and sanitation \nin rural areas. The program includes continued support for the government\u2019s fight against poverty by addressing \nenvironmental problems related to air, water, and land, and promoting rural development in mountainous areas in \nShaanxi province (SP) and other western provinces/autonomous regions. \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement (PPA), signed by the Government and ADB in September 2003, sets out \nstrategies and interventions for poverty reduction. PRC and ADB will continue to cooperate on a broad range of \nactivities related to policy and regulatory reform and capacity building in the environment sector, and support projects \nto address environment problems. Projects will be designed so that the poor capture some of the environmental \nbenefits. To sharpen the poverty focus of environmental work, PRC and ADB are addressing land degradation by \nsupporting the implementation of the 10-year ($150 million, grant-financed) PRC-Global Environment Facility (GEF) \nPartnership for Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems to address policy, institutional, technical, and financing issues \nrelated to combating land degradation, and other projects using GEF grants and loan funds to reduce poverty, arrest \nland degradation, and improve environmental management in the western region. \n \nThe Qinling Mountain (QM) range of SP where the project will be located has a total population 4.9 million people, or \n13.8% of SP\u2019s total, with an average density of 83 persons per square kilometer. The project\u2019s activities will directly \n(through investments) or indirectly (through strategy/policy changes, improved planning and conservation, and long- \nterm actions) impact the entire range. The QM covers 38 counties and 7 cities, of which 74% are classed as national \nor provincial poverty counties. Poverty is widespread, with small-scale agriculture on steep slopes, very limited \ninfrastructure throughout the rugged and isolated valleys, and few links to the modern economy. In 2004, the average \nannual income of urban residents was CNY5,928 ($716.8 equivalent) while the average annual per capita income of \nthe rural population (approximately 84% of the QM population) was only CNY1,050  ($ 127 equivalent), or 35% of the \npoverty level on a $1/day basis. The projecr preparatory TA (PPTA) will design and investment project for loan and \ngrant  financing  to  improve  biodiversity  conservation  and  reduce  land  degradation  in  the  QM.  It  will  feature \ncommercially sustainable biodiversity conservation and ecotourism at Louguantai, and improved land management \nwithin the wider QM range. It will include (i) an assessment of the enabling conditions for the Louguantai biodiversity \nconservation and tourism site, including policies, regulations, and incentives; (ii) appropriate institutional arrangements \nfor the Project, including for capacity building; (iii) design of the Louguantai facility and core area (approximately 458 \nsquare kilometers) as a commercial venue for biodiversity conservation, scientific display and research, and ecological \nand cultural tourism; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation system to gauge the impact of conservation. Project \ninterventions feature community-based programs in rural areas, and public-private partnerships, especially in tourism. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Environment \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPoverty analysis will comprise the following: (i) rural and urban consultations/surveys in the main ecosystems of the \nQM range; (ii) participatory focus group discussions with vulnerable groups such as women, migratory groups, herders \nfacing a grazing ban, illegal loggers facing a logging ban, and people living on the forest slope margins to determine \nthe linkage between income, poverty, and non-income poverty and the environment, and their options for the future; \n(iii)  design  of  interventions  in  policy/planning,  regulations,  institutions  and  physical  investments  to  address \nconservation and tourism, water resources including conservation and pollution, and sustainable livelihood activities. \nPublic-private partnerships will be important, especially in tourism. \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes   No  \n \nA brief stakeholder analysis was conducted during TA fact-finding and the roles of the key stakeholders were identified \nand agreed upon in the signed Memorandum of Understanding. Based on detailed discussions and site visits, the \nExecuting Agency will be the Foreign Loan Support Management Office of the Shaanxi Provincial Development and \nReform Commission. The leading group will be chaired by the responsible vice-governor, and will coordinate and \nenlist the support of involved and concerned agencies to ensure smooth implementation. The group will also play its \nrole as a steering committee. Headed by the director general of the Provincial Planning and Reformation Commission \n(PDRC), the standing office will be set up under the leading group. The project management office (PMO) will be \nestablished with experts on plant and animal biology, economics, finance, tourism, management, marketing, legal and \nregulatory aspects, information technology, and other needed fields. The PMO will engage 8-10 permanent staff and \nlink closely to the existing group of the Qinling Botanical Garden. An expert panel (EP) will provide technical guidance \nto the PMO and the consultant team. The EP will comprise 6-8 senior scientists and experts in integrated ecosystem \nmanagement, biodiversity conservation, ecotourism, geographic information systems, natural resources management, \nand business management from relevant companies, national and provincial universities, and institutes. Panel \nmembers will be paid a lump sum honorarium. In addition, the arrangements in SP for implementing the ongoing PRC-\nGEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  build  capacity  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation. During the TA those responsible for preparing the full project proposal will consult fully with the above \ninstitutions, and make field visits to potential project pilot/demonstration sites. The project components will be \ndesigned and reviewed through a process of stakeholder consultation involving the concerned authorities and \ntechnical agencies at the SP, country and city and local government levels, as well as concerned nongovernment \norganizations and private sector bodies. A series of informal and formal consultations will be held with representatives \nof the key project beneficiaries (including rural households within the project area) to take into consideration their \nconcerns and aspirations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nTo strengthen the design, the EP will provide technical guidance to the PMO. In addition, participatory focus group \ndiscussions will be held with the community, including vulnerable groups, and with private sector corporations to \ndetermine their interest and capacity to participate in the project. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender analysis: Gender roles are determined by a combination of cultural factors, occupations, environmental \nconditions, education levels and employment opportunities. During TA implementation, women\u2019s roles in the proposed \nproject activities, including in institutional capacity building will be assessed. The need for gender-specific groups, or \nother measures will be assessed. \n \nGender and development plan:  The project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but a gender plan \nwill need to be developed, given the fact that local staff have low gender sensitivity and lack the knowledge and skills \nfor gender analysis and planning. The gender plan will ensure equal participation of women. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nThis will be prepared during the PPTA phase.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nE.
