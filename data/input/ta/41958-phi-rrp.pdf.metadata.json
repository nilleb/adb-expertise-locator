The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  Power generation in the Philippines was a virtual monopoly until an executive order \n(EO 215), signed in 1988 opened the door to private generating companies. A power crisis in \nthe early 1990s crippled the country and forced the Government to enter into a large number of \npower supply contracts with independent power producers (IPPs) in quick succession.  Over \n2 years, the National Power Corporation (NPC)1 entered into 27 power purchase agreements \n(PPAs) with IPPs, and, by 1999, IPPs accounted for 55% of total installed capacity in the \ncountry. These PPAs contain minimum offtake provisions, as well as fuel cost pass-through and \nforeign exchange adjustments. The obligations of NPC under these PPAs are guaranteed by \nthe national Government.  \n \n3.  The additional power from the IPPs came online just when the Asian financial crisis \noccurred. Demand for power therefore did not grow as projected, resulting in an oversupply of \nelectricity in the country. Still, unit prices for electricity dispatched rose because of the minimum \nofftake provisions of the PPAs. As a result, the cost of electricity in the country today is among \nthe highest in Asia. The situation was complicated further by the substantial depreciation of the \nPhilippine  peso  during  the  same  period.  These  two  factors,  together  with  insufficient  tariff \nincreases, contributed to a decline in the financial health of NPC, which recorded a net profit of \nabout P3.1 billion ($74.6 million) in 1997 to a net loss of about P13.0 billion ($312.8 million) in \n20002 causing a strain on the financial resources of the Government.  \n \n4.  Against this background, the Government decided to embark on market-oriented reforms \nand on 8 June 2001 signed into law the Energy Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA, or Republic \nAct 9135). EPIRA was designed primarily to reduce public debt, improve efficiency in the sector, \nand encourage competition to bring down the cost of electricity. The main feature of the law was \nthe privatization of the generation and transmission assets of NPC under the management of \nthe Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM). EPIRA also created \na wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) and advocated competition in the retail supply of \nelectricity.  \n \n5.  PSALM\u2019s power plant privatization target was to sell 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible capacity in \nLuzon and Visayas by June 2004. This process has lagged far behind target, with only about \n11% of NPC\u2019s eligible capacity in Luzon and Visayas turned over to private companies by \nJuly 2007.  The  privatization  program  however  gained  momentum  in  2007  when  NPC \nsuccessfully auctioned off four power plants,3 though these plants have yet to achieve financial \nclosure. Appendix 2 gives an update on the privatization of NPC\u2019s power plants. \n                                                 \n1  NPC is a state-owned utility that was solely responsible for electricity generation and transmission in the Philippines \nuntil EPIRA was passed into law and implemented.  \n2  Woodhouse, Erik J. 2005. The IPP Experience in the Philippines. Stanford University. \n3  The power plants auctioned are Masinloc (600 MW), Calaca (600 MW), Ambuklao (75 MW), and Binga (100 MW). \n ", "2      \n \n6.  PSALM offered the Calaca plant for sale by competitive bidding on 16 October 2007 and \ndrew  interest  from  three  bidders.4  Calaca  Holdco  Inc.  (which  later  became  EEC),  a \nspecial-purpose company wholly owned by Suez-Tractebel S.A. (Suez) through its subsidiary \nBelgelectric Finance B.V. (BFB), submitted the winning bid of $786.53 million.  \n \n7.  Several  bidders  had  approached  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  financial \nsupport for their plans to acquire, refurbish, and operate the Calaca plant. After the bid was \nawarded  to  EEC  and  Suez  Energy  International  (SEI)5  confirmed  its  request  for  financial \nassistance from ADB, the concept clearance paper was finalized and approved by Management \non 12 November 2007.  \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Philippine Power Sector \n1.  Power Situation in Luzon \n8.  The Philippine electrical power grid, with about 15,803 MW of installed capacity, is \ndivided into three: Luzon (Northern Philippines), Visayas (Central Philippines), and Mindanao \n(Southern Philippines). The Luzon grid, where the Calaca plant is located, is the largest of the \nthree grids and accounts for about 76.5% of the total installed capacity nationwide in 2006. \n(Refer to Table 1 for a profile of the Luzon grid.) A large portion of the load in the Luzon grid is \nin Metro Manila, while the generation sources are in the northern and southern parts of Luzon.  \n \n9.  At present, the supply of electricity throughout Luzon indicates that there is enough \nsupply to meet demand, with a dependable capacity of 10,466 MW in 2006 against an actual \npeak demand of 6,466 MW and required capacity6 of 7,953 MW. However, from 26 June 2006 \nto 25 June 2007 only about two thirds of the dependable capacity was offered on the spot \nmarket. With few exceptions, the offered capacity ranged from 3,500 MW to 7,400 MW.7 A \nreview of the hourly load during the first year of the spot-market operations, on the other hand, \nshowed demand ranging from 2,500 MW to about 6,500 MW, and averaging about 4,600 MW \ngiven  a  load  factor  of  72%.8  This  would  indicate  that  offered  capacities  approximate  the \ndemand.  \n \n10.  The supply of electricity in Luzon is vulnerable to the weather and other factors. Thinning \nwater reserves during the dry season make the capacity of hydropower plants unreliable. Power \nfrom the plants at this time typically falls to about one fourth of dependable capacity, and a \nprolonged dry season can temporarily shut down the plants. Power supply also depends on the \navailability and reliability of fuel. Fuel for coal- and oil-fired power plants, which together account \nfor about 50% of the dependable capacity in Luzon, is imported and procured on the spot \n                                                 \n4  The two other bidders were First Gen Corporation (Philippines) and AES Corporation (USA). \n5  SEI is a division of Suez-Tractebel. \n6  Required capacity refers to the peak demand plus the Energy Regulatory Commission\u2013approved reserve margin \nabove the peak demand of 23.4%, consisting of 2.8% load following and frequency regulation, 10.3% spinning \nreserve, and 10.3% back up.  \n7  Philippine Electricity Market Corporation. 2007. Annual Market Assessment Report for the Period 26 June 2006 to \n25 June 2007. Manila. \n8 Studies indicate that the load factor, which is the ratio of average demand to peak demand in Luzon, has \nconsistently been in the 72% range since 1991.  ", " \n  3\nmarket by NPC. The recent strong global demand for coal and oil, and NPC\u2019s inadequate \ninventory  of  fuel,  has occasionally  led  to  fuel  supply  shortages.  Another  key  factor  is  the \nuncoordinated  scheduling  of  plant  repair  and  maintenance,  since  many  of  the  plants  are \nseparately owned. Repair and maintenance has taken power plants out of the system for \nweeks.  Finally,  because  of  their  overall  poor  condition,  many  NPC  plants  often  fail  or \nunexpectedly shut down.      \n \nTable 1: Installed and Dependable Capacity, by Fuel Source, in Luzon, 2006 \n \nInstalled Capacity    Dependable Capacity    Electricity Generation \nFuel Source \nMW  %    MW  %    GWh  % \nCoal  3,769    31.2  3,287    31.4  14,099    34.2 \nDiesel/Oil  2,333    19.3  1,928    18.4  1,711      4.2 \nHydropower  2,247    18.6  1,813    17.3  5,492    13.3 \nNatural Gas  2,763    22.8  2,703    25.8  16,366    39.7 \nGeothermal  954      7.9  726      7.0  3,520      8.5 \nNonconventional  25      0.2  9      0.1  53      0.1 \n  Total  12,091  100.0  10,466  100.0  41,241  100.0 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nNote: The figures may not add up because of rounding. \nSource: Department of Energy power statistics. \n \n \n11.  By Department of Energy (DOE) estimates, energy consumption in Luzon will increase \nby an average of 4.0% yearly. This is a realistic estimate, given the 4.9% average growth in \ngross domestic product in 2002\u20132006 against a 3.4% annual growth in peak electricity demand. \nWith two major power plants scheduled for retirement in 2009\u201320109 and only 38 MW of \ncommitted projects under construction, DOE predicts a need for about 1,950 MW of additional \ngenerating capacity in the Luzon grid by 2014. There are concerns that given the difficulty in \nselling NPC assets, the addition of new capacity in a timely manner to replace decommissioned \npower plants would even be more challenging. Moreover, the law no longer provides for a \ndefault producer of power or a government agency that could contract capacity from IPPs to \nensure a stable supply and meet expected demand. If no additional capacity is created in the \nmeantime,10 the critical period in the Luzon grid will begin in 2011, when the reserve margin will \nfall below the required minimum level. About P71.0 billion ($1.7 billion) will be needed to finance \nthe additional capacity required in Luzon, according to DOE. \n2.  Industry Structure and Reforms \n12.  The signing of EPIRA in 2001 signaled a radical change in the Philippine power sector. \nThe significant provisions of the law include (i) the creation of PSALM to own and manage the \nprivatization  of  NPC  generation  and  transmission  assets,  (ii)  the  creation  of  the  Energy \nRegulatory Commission (ERC) with wide-ranging powers to regulate the behavior of participants \nin the industry, (iii) the congressional investigation and review of all IPP contracts, (iv) the \nunbundling of power rates, (v) the creation of WESM, and (vi) the development of competition in \nthe retail supply of electricity.   \n \n                                                 \n9  These are the Hopewell gas turbine power plant (100 MW of dependable capacity) and Malaya oil thermal power \nplant (650 MW of dependable capacity). \n10 The  country\u2019s  power  development  plan  assumes  that  roughly  1,750  MW  from  three  power  plants  will  be \ncommissioned by 2009\u20132010. But none of the plants identified (San Gabriel, Ilijan gas-fired expansion, and \nGN Power coal-fired) have started construction.  ", "4      \n13.  The EPIRA-mandated restructuring program has met most of the above targets, albeit \nmuch later than originally planned. However, until recently, no significant privatization of NPC \nassets has taken place (para. 5), while the implementation of a retail market remains uncertain \nsince key conditions precedent have yet to be realized.  \n \n14.  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation.  PSALM  is  a \ngovernment  corporation  established  primarily  to  implement  EPIRA\u2019s  restructuring  and \nprivatization  mandate.  EPIRA  requires  PSALM  to  take  ownership  of  all  NPC  assets  and \nliabilities. In carrying out its mandate, PSALM will inevitably incur substantial losses from its \noperations largely because of the excessive debt of NPC, take-or-pay provisions of the IPP \ncontracts, and insufficient tariff increases. To offset these costs, PSALM relies heavily on the \nproceeds of the sale of NPC assets (as they occur). Other future revenue sources of PSALM \nare the concession fees from the transmission grid concessionaire (as and when the franchise \nis granted to the winning bidder, para. 27) and the proceeds of the stranded debt and costs \nlevied  on  electricity  consumers  (para. 34).  To  ease  the  financial  burden  of  PSALM,  the \nGovernment assumed P200 billion in debt at the end of 2004. ERC also approved a tariff \nincrease in 2005. These measures turned PSALM\u2019s financial fortunes around, producing a net \nincome of P1,904 million ($45.8 million) in 2005 and P685 million ($16.5 million) in 2006.11 NPC \nalso recorded a favorable net income of P86.0 billion ($2.1 billion) in 2005 and P90.0 billion \n($2.2 billion) in 2006.12 \n \n15.  Besides overseeing the privatization of NPC assets, PSALM is tasked to review and \nrenegotiate the IPP contracts. By the end of 2004, PSALM had substantially renegotiated the \nIPP contracts, saving up to $2.9 billion in the process. As the privatization of NPC assets and \nthe levy of stranded debt and costs progress further, PSALM should have enough revenues to \nfund all of its liabilities, which amounted to P60.6 billion ($1.5 billion) at the end of 2006, while \nalso helping reduce the liabilities of NPC, which amounted to P1,062 billion ($25.6 billion). \n \n16.  Unless it is extended by law, PSALM has a corporate life of 25 years from the effectivity \ndate of EPIRA. Under EPIRA, all assets and liabilities of PSALM that are outstanding when its \nterm expires will be assumed by the Government.13   \n \n17.  Regulation.  The  ERC  is  an  independent  quasi-judicial  regulatory  body  created  by \nEPIRA to replace the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB). It is mandated to promote competition, \nencourage market development, and penalize abuse of market power. Among its functions are: \n(i) establishing and enforcing a method of setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates, \n(ii) amending or revoking the authority of an industry participant to operate that fails to comply \nwith EPIRA or any order of the ERC, and (iii) resolving disputes between participants in the \nsector.  \n \n18.  The ERC also reviews and must approve the terms and conditions of most industry \ncontracts where a regulated entity (i.e., a distribution utility [DU] or transmission operator) is a \ncounterparty. In particular, a generating company may sell power to any franchised DU through \na bilateral contract, provided ERC approves the transaction to ensure that the DU can recover \nits generation cost from its customers. The present role of ERC in setting rates and approving \nindustry transactions will, however, be phased out with the operation of the WESM, open \n                                                 \n11 Commission on Audit, Republic of the Philippines.

Specifically, bilateral contracts with other generators, or directly \nwith end users14 or contestable customers,15 will not require regulatory approval. \n \n19.  The success of the power sector reforms depends largely on public confidence in the \nsector\u2019s  regulatory  regime.  Investors  will  be  particularly  concerned  with  the  regulator\u2019s \nindependence from political pressure, its technical experience, and the efficiency, transparency, \nand consistency of review and decision making. To address these concerns and move the \nreform program forward, ADB has provided a loan16 and technical assistance17 to the Philippines \nto support ERC\u2019s ability to, among others, (i) respond efficiently and fairly to market issues, and \n(ii) communicate all regulatory matters clearly and effectively to the public and to stakeholders. \nThe continued involvement of ADB in the sector as lender and provider of technical assistance \nhelps ensure the stability of the regulatory regime. \n \n20.  Distribution. The distribution of electricity remains a regulated activity under EPIRA. \nPower is distributed through DUs, which are given an exclusive franchise to operate in a \nparticular geographic area. There are now 136 DUs, of which 13 are private companies, 4 are \nowned by local government units, and 119 are customer-owned electric cooperatives. The \nlargest DU is Manila Electric Company (Meralco), which holds the distribution franchise for 23 \ncities and 88 municipalities including Metro Manila. Its service area covers almost a quarter of \nthe Philippine population and produces about 50% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. In \n2006, Meralco sold 25.1 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity,18 or about 60% of the power \ngenerated in Luzon. \n \n21.  EPIRA allows generating companies to sell electricity to DUs, or to retail electricity \nsuppliers through bilateral contracts or the WESM. But no DU may source more than 50% of its \ntotal demand from an associated generating company through bilateral power supply contracts. \nPower purchase contracts entered into before EPIRA are exempted from this requirement. \n \n22.  Generation. The generation of electricity will not be regulated by ERC. However, to \nensure a competitive market, EPIRA requires that no one company, including its related entities, \nmay  own  more  than  30%  of  the  installed  generating  capacity  of  the  Luzon,  Visayas,  or \nMindanao  grid  or  25%  of  the  total  installed  generating  capacity  nationwide.  Generating \ncompanies in the country can be classified into four groups: (i) NPC-owned power plants, which \nare being privatized; (ii) NPC IPPs, which are privately owned power plants with long-term PPAs \nwith NPC; (iii) Meralco IPPs, which are power plants owned by the private sector and have long-\nterm PPAs with Meralco; and (iv) other IPPs, which comprise power plants purchased from NPC \nby the private sector. \n \n23.  At present, about 92.3% of the installed capacity in the country and 94.6% in Luzon is \nowned or controlled collectively by NPC or PSALM and Meralco (Table 2). PSALM, which is \nresponsible for bidding the generation capacity of NPC IPPs on the WESM, has grouped these \n                                                 \n14 In general, generating companies may not sell power directly to industrial or commercial customers connected to \nthe network of a DU until open access and retail competition is declared by ERC. However, about 114 industrial \ncustomers have been allowed to source power directly from NPC. No regulatory restriction prohibits other \ngenerating companies from reaching an agreement with such customers once these customers\u2019 contracts with \nNPC expire.  \n15 Once retail competition is implemented, contestable customers will initially be defined as end users with an \naverage monthly peak demand of 1 MW.  \n16  ADB. 2006.

Each trading group is responsible \nfor bidding the capacity of the generation assets in its portfolio to achieve maximum dispatch \nand revenues. NPC, on the other hand, bids the capacity of its plants on the WESM separately.  \n \nTable 2: Installed Capacity, by Type of Generator, 2006 \n \nPhilippines    Luzon \nOwnership \nMW  %    MW  % \nNPC  4,173  26.4    2,469  20.4 \nNPC IPPs  8,113  51.3    6,669  55.2 \nMeralco IPPs  2,304  14.6    2,304  19.1 \nOther IPPs  1,213  7.7    649  5.4 \nTotal  15,803  100.0    12,091  100.0 \nIPP = independent power producer, Meralco = Manila Electric Company, MW = megawatt, NPC = \nNational Power Corporation. \nNote: The figures may not add up because of rounding. \nSource: Department of Energy power statistics.  \n \n \n24.  With assistance from ADB and the World Bank, PSALM is undertaking an initiative to \nappoint IPP administrators (IPPAs)20 to manage the contracted capacity of NPC, including \nbidding on the WESM and bilateral contracting. The IPPAs will operate independently of PSALM \nto minimize opportunities for collusion.  \n \n25.  Transmission. The National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) was established in \n2001  as  a  limited-liability  corporation  wholly  owned  by  PSALM,  to  assume  the  electrical \ntransmission functions of NPC until privatization.  \n \n26.  In Luzon, TransCo operates a 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission backbone running north to \nsouth, which is designed to adequately transfer large amounts of power to Metro Manila. This \nsystem is running well and is unlikely to cause constraints in the foreseeable future. TransCo \nalso manages a 230 kV system that works in parallel with the 500 kV line. This 230 kV system \ndoes  have  transmission  constraints,  though  these  are  expected  to  be  addressed  by  the \ncompletion of the expansion projects approved under the current transmission development \nplan. Both systems are designed and operated at N\u2212121 contingency levels.   \n  \n27.  EPIRA requires the privatization of the transmission assets of NPC. The structure of the \nprivatization calls for a concession to be awarded through competitive bidding, granting the \nwinning  bidder  the  exclusive  right  to  operate  the  transmission  systems  throughout  the \nPhilippines for 25 years. The concessionaire will be responsible for improving, expanding, \noperating, and maintaining the transmission system and will be entitled to receive regulated \nwheeling charges for its services. Legal title to the transmission assets will, however, remain \nwith TransCo. Bidding for the sale of the transmission assets of TransCo was held in December \n2007. Two bidders took part in the process and the concession was awarded to a consortium \nconsisting of the State Grid Corporation of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Monte Oro \nGrid Resources Corporation, which submitted a bid price of $3.95 billion.

", " \n  7\nconcession will be subject to, among others, Congress\u2019 granting a franchise to the winning \nbidder to carry out the concession. \n \n28.  Wholesale  Electricity  Spot  Market.  An  important  component  of  the  power  sector \nreform is the establishment of a market for electricity to encourage competition in the sector and \nreduce the cost of energy. The WESM, which started commercial operations in June 2006, is a \ngross-offer pool, net-settlements market, which enables the trading of electricity as a commodity \nin 24 one-hour trading periods daily. All available power in the system, including contracted \ncapacity under bilateral arrangements, is offered on the market and will be dispatched in the \norder of their bid price, with the market clearing at the price set by the highest bidder to be \ndispatched.   \n29.  EPIRA permits industry players to enter into bilateral contracts for a fixed price and \nquantity of electricity. Such contracts will be structured as \u201ccontracts for differences\u201d rather than \ncontracts  for  electricity  supply.  Differences  between  the  market  clearing  price  and  the \ncontracted price will be settled by the contracting parties outside the WESM. Of the total volume \ntraded in July 2007, only about 16% was not contracted with bilateral parties. The rest was all \nsubject to bilateral contracts. EPIRA permits such arrangements but limits each DU to sourcing \nno more than 90% of its power requirements from bilateral supply contracts during the first 5 \nyears of the WESM.  \n30.  In the first year of commercial operations of the WESM, the weekly spot price ranged \nfrom P0.00/kWh ($0.00/kWh) to P12.58/kWh ($0.30/kWh), for a median weekly average price of \nabout P4.27/kWh ($0.10/kWh).  \n \n31.  Open Access and Retail Competition. A key objective of EPIRA is to enable retail \ncustomers to choose their electricity provider. To this end, qualified parties should be allowed to \nuse distribution lines provided they pay the wheeling rates approved by ERC. EPIRA, however, \nstates that open access and retail competition can be declared by ERC only when all of the \npreconditions have been met. Two of these preconditions\u2014(i) the privatization of at least 70% of \nthe total capacity of NPC generation assets in Luzon and Visayas, and (ii) the transfer of the \nmanagement and control of at least 70% of the total energy output of power plants under \ncontracts with NPC to IPPAs\u2014have yet to be achieved.22 If the momentum for the sale of NPC \nassets  continues,  then  the  privatization  condition  is  likely  to  be  achieved  by  2009.  The \nimplementation of the IPPAs, on the other hand, remains uncertain because of the complexity of \nthe transaction. ADB and the World Bank are providing technical assistance to facilitate this \nprocess. In addition to the preconditions stipulated by law, ERC also requires the establishment \nof a customer switching system and pertinent regulations.  \n \n32.  ERC will announce the start of retail competition when all of the conditions referred to in \nthe  previous  paragraph  have  been  met.  Implementation  will  begin  6  months  after  the \nannouncement. At this time, it is unclear when all of the preconditions will be satisfied.23 Retail \ncompetition will be implemented in phases beginning with end users that have an average peak \ndemand of 1 MW. The second phase will cover single or aggregated loads of at least 750 kW. \nThereafter, the threshold will go down gradually until ultimately, households are given the right \nto choose their electricity provider. \n \n                                                 \n22 Amendments to EPIRA are now being considered by Congress. These amendments will lower the threshold of \nopen access to the sale of 50% of NPC generation assets and the transfer of 50% of the IPP contracts. \n23 In August 2007, the President announced that open access would apply immediately within the boundaries of the \nspecial industrial zones, also referred to as economic zones. ", "8      \n33.  Universal Charge. A component of the electric bill levied on end users is a universal \ncharge  collected  for  specific  purposes  including  missionary  electrification,  environmental \ncharges, payment of NPC\u2019s stranded debt and costs, and payment of DUs\u2019 stranded costs. This \ncharge  is  collected  by  DUs  as  a  pass-through  charge.  At  present,  only  the  missionary \nelectrification24 and environmental components are collected by the DUs.  \n \n34.  Stranded Debt and Costs. EPIRA permits NPC, PSALM, and DUs to recover through a \nuniversal charge those costs associated with their take-or-pay contracts that were approved by \nERB as of 31 December 2000.25 These costs take two forms: stranded debt and stranded costs. \nStranded  debt  refers  to  unpaid  obligations  of  NPC,  while  stranded  cost  is  the  difference \nbetween the NPC-contracted purchase price and the actual price at which electricity was sold. \nThe amount of stranded debt and costs that NPC or PSALM would seek to recover would \ndepend on several factors including the proceeds from the privatization program. The imposition \nof the stranded cost charges on customers within the universal charge, and the period of such \nimposition, will require ERC approval. \nB.  ADB Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n35.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for the Philippines26 lists fiscal imbalance, \npoor investment climate, and weak governance as the country\u2019s three most critical binding \ndevelopment constraints.  The CSP developed a set of targeted sector policy reform packages, \neach of which is expected to have a direct impact on at least one of these constraints. The three \nreform areas are power, financial markets, and governance.27 Improving the investment climate \nis a focus of all proposed program lending operations, and infrastructure weaknesses have \nbeen repeatedly identified by business as a key obstacle to investment in the Philippines. The \nPower  Sector  Development  Program  (PSDP)  (footnote  16)  will  directly  affect  fiscal \nconsolidation28 by reducing the losses at NPC, making PSALM and the energy companies more \ncreditworthy, and creating conditions for the privatization of major power assets. The CSP \nadvocates more cooperation between ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations to boost the \nconfidence of investors and promote private investment to offset fiscally constrained public \ninvestment. PSDP support for a well-regulated, privatized power sector, together with financial \ninvestments, will increase investor interest.  \n                                                 \n24 Missionary electrification includes the provision of electricity either to an EC whose distribution network is not \nconnected to the main grid or to unelectrified barangays that are not served by an EC because it would be \nuneconomical to do so. \n25 R.A. 9136 Electricity Power Industry Reform Act of 2001.

Manila. \n27 To further support the Government\u2019s efforts to improve the fiscal situation and to broaden the reform program, ADB \nis providing a program cluster covering reforms in fiscal policy, governance in public financial management, the \ninvestment climate, and social inclusion. The first subprogram in the cluster was approved on 8 February 2007 \n(ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Cluster \nLoan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Philippines for the Development Policy Support \nProgram. Manila). The second subprogram is expected to be processed in early 2008. \n28 Other policy-based operations are: the Local Government Finance and Budget Reform Program, the Financial \nMarkets and Intermediation Program, the Microfinance Development Program, and the Justice Reform Program.  ", " \n  9\n2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n36.  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy29  defines  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \npoverty by creating an energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth, (ii) promoting \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors, (iii) addressing regional and global environmental impact, and \n(iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  advocates  ADB \ninterventions to increase private sector participation in the energy sector to take advantage of \nthe  higher  operating  efficiencies  of  private  operators  and  to  respond  to  the  large  capital \nrequirements  of  power  projects.  The  strategy  also  supports  market  liberalization  and  the \nscrapping of subsidies.  \n3.  The Project\u2019s Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n37.  The Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies. It will directly \ncontribute to achieving the PSDP objective of correcting the country\u2019s fiscal imbalance by \ncatalyzing the privatization of an NPC-owned power plant and earning sales revenues for the \nGovernment.  The  Project  will  also  help  improve  the  investment  climate  by  increasing  the \nreliability  of  generating  capacity  for  commercial  and  industrial  centers.  The  successful \nacquisition and operation of the Calaca plant by a reputable foreign entity will boost market \nconfidence and encourage the further privatization of NPC assets and the entry of new players \ninto the market. The Project will enhance competition in the generator market and, in the long \nrun, help drive down the price of electricity.  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n1.  Current Status \n38.  The Calaca plant is a nominal 600 MW base-load pulverized coal\u2013fired power plant. \nEach of its two generating units has a gross rated capacity of 300 MW. Unit 1 is equipped with a \nFoster Wheeler coal-fired, subcritical, natural-circulation, reheat boiler designed to operate on \nhigh-quality coal. Unit 2 is equipped with an ABB Combustion Engineering coal-fired, subcritical, \nforced-circulation, reheat boiler designed to operate on lower-quality coal of the type that may \nbe sourced within the Philippines.  \n \n39.  Unit  1  was  built  at  a  total  cost  of  $238.50  million  and  was  commissioned  on \n11 September 1984. The Export-Import Bank of Japan provided funding for its construction. The \nPhilippine Government later sought Japanese Government financing for the construction of \nunit 2 through official development assistance. Unit 2 was completed at a total project cost of \n$351.67 million and began commercial operations on 5 July 1995. The design of the Calaca \nplant is conventional and typical of modern coal-fired power plants. The plant was originally built \nto a reasonably high standard, with the use of world-class technology. NPC has managed and \noperated the Calaca plant since the start of commercial operations of unit 1 in 1984.  \n \n40.  The  plant  is  currently  operating  under  poor  conditions:  its  availability  and  reliability \nstatistics are well below those expected from a plant of this fuel type, technology, size, and age. \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. ", "10     \nBoth units of the Calaca plant have been operating with load restrictions for a significant period \nof each year for various operational reasons. In 2002\u20132006, unit 1 had an average forced \noutage rate of 17.2%, and unit 2, 14.4%. Similar plants in North America have an average \nequivalent availability factor of 84.1% and a forced outage rate of 4.8%. Appendix 3 gives the \noperating statistics for the Calaca plant from 2002 to 2006. \n \n41.  The due diligence done by various experts suggests that the plant can recover its \nperformance  and  reliability  and  could  operate  for  another  20  years  if  the  appropriate \nrefurbishment program is implemented and suitable operating and maintenance standards are \napplied. Its poor condition is attributable not to the original design of the plant but to poor \nmanagement, inadequate maintenance, and insufficient stocking of spare parts on-site. The use \nof coal that does not conform to boiler specifications has also impaired its performance.  \n2.  Refurbishment and Operation Plan \n42.  The objective of EEC\u2019s proposed refurbishment plan is to return both units to their \noriginal  design  condition  and  capacity.  Once  the  refurbishment  is  completed,  the  plant  is \nexpected to achieve a gross output of 600 MW. The plant would then be in a position to \ncompete directly with other coal-fired power plants and new entrants since EEC would operate \nthe plant to global standards. \n \n43.  SEI will also introduce a new management system to improve the efficiency of the plant \nand increase the productivity of the workers. The new system will also improve the health and \nsafety standards at the plant to a level that would be consistent with industry best practices \nworldwide. An experienced Suez team will oversee the implementation of these practices at the \npower plant through training, mentorship, and day-to-day interaction.  \nB.  Sponsor \n30\n44.  Although formed only in 1997 through a merger, the founding companies  of Suez have \na 150-year history of providing natural gas, electricity, and water services in Europe and around \nthe world. Suez is considered one of the largest power companies in the world, with a portfolio \nof 60,000 MW of installed power production capacity at the end of 2006. In addition to being the \nfifth-largest electricity provider in Europe, Suez is also the leading private power generator in \nBrazil and Thailand and the leading private developer in terms of installed power capacity in the \nGulf countries. Suez, with a Moody\u2019s issuer rating of A2 and an S&P LT issuer credit of A\u2013, had \n\u20ac44.3 billion in revenues and net income of \u20ac3.6 billion in 2006. Consolidated assets stood at \n\u20ac73.4 billion and consolidated shareholder\u2019s equity at \u20ac19.5 billion at the end of 2006. Suez is \nlisted on the Brussels, Luxembourg, Paris, New York, and Zurich stock exchanges. \n \n45.  As one of the major energy producers on the deregulated European markets, the Suez \ngroup  has  developed  significant  expertise  in  managing  merchant  plants.  Through  its \nsubsidiaries, Suez manages almost 50 merchant power plants across the world, representing \nan installed capacity of 24,404 MW, or 40% of the group\u2019s total capacities. See Appendix 4 for a \nlist of merchant power plants owned and operated by Suez globally. \n \n                                                 \n30 Suez traces its history to the following companies: (i) Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique, founded in 1822 in Belgium; \n(ii) Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez, founded in 1858 in France; (ii) Compagnie Lyonnaise des \nEaux et de l\u2019Eclairage, founded in 1880 in France; and (iv) Tractebel, founded in 1895 in Belgium. \n ", " \n  11\n46.  SEI is the business line of Suez responsible for the group\u2019s energy activities outside \nEurope. It manages over 27,000 MW of installed generating capacity in 18 countries out of the \n60,000 MW global portfolio of Suez. The fleet of power plants owned or managed by SEI \nincludes 12 coal-fired power plants in six countries with a net installed capacity of 2,309 MW. \nApart from power generation, SEI also transports and distributes natural gas. In 2006, SEI sold \n109.9 million megawatt-hours of electricity and 13.61 billion cubic meters of natural gas to more \nthan one million customers, generating revenues of \u20ac6.2 billion, or about 14% of the total \nrevenues of Suez that year.   \n \n47.  When SEI started operations in 1988\u20131989, its power projects were linked to long-term \nPPAs. With the gradual deregulation of energy markets worldwide, SEI moved from being a \npure developer and operator of assets to an asset-based organization that markets a wide \nrange of products and services. In North America, Suez Energy Marketing N.A. trades all the \npower generated by the fleet of merchant power plants of SEI. Today, SEI manages a portfolio \nof nine merchant power plants with a combined installed capacity of 4,219 MW out of its \nportfolio of 27,000 MW.   \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n48.  The  terms  of  acquisition  of  the  Calaca  power  plant  and  its  related  land  rights  are \nestablished under two key transaction documents: (i) the asset purchase agreement, and (ii) the \nland lease agreement. \n1.  Asset Purchase Agreement \n49.  An asset purchase agreement (APA) was signed by the bidder and submitted by EEC as \npart of its bid. Since the bid date, the APA has also been signed by PSALM. The APA requires \nEEC to pay at least 40% of the purchase price up front in order for it to take possession of the \nCalaca plant and have the right to operate it. EEC must pay the balance in equal semiannual \ninstallments over a 7-year period. Until full payment is made, PSALM will remain the owner of \nthe plant.   \n   \n50.  The APA may be terminated by either party by reason of default by the other. A PSALM \ndefault includes its failure to obtain transferable rights to the foreshore lands within 7 years from \nthe closing date. EEC has numerous obligations, which, if breached, would give rise to an EEC \ndefault. These include (i) paying PSALM the amounts that are due, when they are due; (ii) \ndischarging all the rights, liabilities, and obligations of PSALM under contracts that remain in \neffect after the acquisition date; and (iii) paying taxes, fees, and penalties.  \n2.  Land Lease Agreement \n51.  The project occupies an area of about 2.1 million square meters comprising onshore \nland, foreshore land, and submerged land. EEC will lease the onshore land from PSALM for 25 \nyears under a land lease agreement (LLA) dated 16 October 2007. The agreement also gives \nEEC or its affiliate the option to acquire the leased land, subject to its meeting Philippine \nqualification requirements for land ownership.31  \n                                                 \n31 Philippine regulations allow only Filipino citizens and corporations or partnerships where at least 60% of the shares \nare owned by Filipinos, to own or acquire land. ", "12     \n3.  Power Supply Contracts \n52.  The supply rights to 11 existing power supply contracts (PSCs) will be assigned to EEC \nalong with the assets of the Calaca plant. The total contracted capacity from these PSCs \nrepresents about 40% of the plant\u2019s rated capacity. Most of the PSCs will expire within the first \n4 years after turnover to EEC.  \n4.  Coal Supply \n53.  Coal is sourced almost exclusively from Semirara Coal Corporation under a long-term \nsupply arrangement. High-quality coal required for blending is procured by NPC for the Calaca \nplant through spot contracts. EEC will coordinate its procurement of coal through Suez regional \noffice in Thailand.  \n5.  Transmission \n54.  The output of the Calaca plant is transmitted through the 230 kV transmission system. \nUnlike transmission lines in the northern transmission corridor, each 230 kV transmission line in \nthe south serves a particular generation subgroup. The Calaca plant belongs to the group 1 \ngenerators, which also include the Sta. Rita and San Lorenzo power plants.32 The group 1 \ngenerators are linked to Manila through the Calaca\u2013Dasmari\u00f1as\u2013Zapote and Calaca\u2013Bi\u00f1an\u2013\nSucat 230 kV lines.  \n \n55.  TransCo has identified two transmission upgrades to allow full dispatch of the South \nLuzon generators. These upgrades are referred to as the Batangas transmission reinforcement \nproject (BTRP) and the Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat 230 kV transmission line. Work on the BTRP is ongoing \nand is expected to be completed by November 2008.33 The objective of the Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat 230 kV \nline project is to increase the transfer capacity of the existing Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat lines that would \nprovide for N\u22121 during full dispatch of the generating plants in South Luzon. Work on this \nproject  has  been  delayed  largely  by  rights-of-way  issues,  which  have  substantially  been \nresolved  recently.  TransCo  does  not  anticipate  any  further  lengthy  delays  and  targets \ncompletion date for the Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat project by 2010.    \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n56.  The Project is located along the shoreline of Barangay San Rafael, Calaca, in the \nprovince of Batangas, about 115 kilometers south of Manila. It is bounded to the north by the \nCalaca\u2013Balayan National Highway, to the east by the Cawong (Bolboc) River, to the west by the \nDacanlao River, and to the south by Balayan Bay.  \n1.  Environment \n57.  The Project is classified as environmental category B under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). An initial environmental examination (IEE) has been conducted and the summary IEE is \navailable at the ADB website. The Project involves the refurbishment of an existing coal-fired \nthermal  power  station  with  no  capacity  expansion  under  the  project  financing  plan;  all \n                                                 \n32 The Sta. Rita and San Lorenzo plants are combined-cycle gas thermal power plants owned by First Gen, an \naffiliate of Meralco. Power from both these plants is transmitted to the Calaca switchyard through 230 kV lines.  \n33 ADB provided a loan to finance the transmission line from Calamba to Sucat under ADB. 1997.

", " \n  13\nmodifications will be confined to the current site. The Project is expected to bring about local \nand environmental benefits, including overall air quality improvements with substantial reduction \nin  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  unit  of  electricity  generated.  EEC  will  target  to  meet  the \nenvironmental standards laid out by the World Bank.34  \n \n58.  The plant has been issued the required environmental clearances and environmental \npermits to operate since 1987.35 The Project is expected to improve the overall environmental \nperformance of the plant by (i) repairing and maintaining (a) electrostatic precipitators, (b) the \ncontinuous emission monitoring system, (c) ambient monitoring stations, and (d) the fugitive \ndust  control  system;  (ii)  rehabilitating  the  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system;  (iii) \nconducting  soil  and  groundwater  investigation;  (iv) reviewing  and  updating  environmental \nmonitoring arrangements; (v) developing management plans for asbestos-containing materials \nand other wastes; and (v) introducing a formal environmental health and safety management \nsystem. The ongoing public consultation and stakeholder engagement program36 will continue \nand will be strengthened as required under ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). A \ndetailed  environmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  compliance  audit  of  the  facility  will  be \nconducted yearly. ADB will review the semiannual environmental monitoring report and the \nannual EHS audit report.  \n2.  Social Aspects \n59.  The Project is classified as category C with respect to involuntary resettlement and \nimpact on indigenous peoples. It will not involve any additional land acquisition, change in land \nuse, or access restriction. The plant site is fenced with no informal settlers on the property. \n \n60.  Involuntary Resettlement. When land was acquired for the plant 27 years ago, 361 \nfamilies in barangays San Rafael, Comastilisan, Quisumbing, and Pantai had to be relocated. \nEach affected household was given a plot of land in a resettlement site, disturbance payment, \nand compensation for land. All private land acquired for the use of the power plant itself is \ncovered by deeds of absolute sale, and there are no pending issues, legal or otherwise, related \nto compensation for land included in the leased premises.  \n \n61.  In addition to compensation payments and a plot of land in a resettlement site, NPC also \nprovided employment opportunities to resettlers and implemented development and livelihood \nprojects, electrification projects, and activities in reforestation, watershed management, health, \nand  environmental  improvement  as  required  under  Energy  Regulation  1-94.37  Current \ncommunity development activities include cattle fattening, road improvements, canal lining, and \n                                                 \n34 The target standard for particulates is 100 milligrams per normal cubic meter (mg/Nm3), more stringent than the \nnational standard of 200 mg/Nm3. For oxides of nitrogen, the plant will comply with 750 mg/Nm3, while standards \nfor sulfur dioxide will be 1,500 mg/Nm3. More stringent effluent discharge standards will also be targeted: 50 \nmilligrams per liter (mg/L) for total suspended solids, following the World Bank\u2019s guidelines, compared with national \nstandards of 200 mg/L; 0.003\u20130.5 mg/L for metals against 0.5\u20131 mg/L; 10 mg/L for oil and grease against 15 mg/L.     \n35 Environmental compliance certificates (ECCs) were issued on 21 April 1987 for unit 1 and on 24 April 1992 for unit \n2. Official notification of sale or transfer to amend the ECCs will be required. Environmental permits need to be \nobtained and renewed periodically. The plant is renewing its effluent discharge permit. \n36 The Multipartite Monitoring Team (MMT) in the original stakeholder engagement program, comprises staff from \nNPC,  DENR,  local  government  units,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  people\u2019s  organizations,  and \nrepresentatives from the private and public sectors. \n37 Energy Regulation 1-94 requires that generation facilities owned by NPC transferred to PSALM and later privatized \nmust  provide  a  P0.01/kWh  financial  benefit  to  host  communities,  including  resettlement  areas.  In  addition, \nP0.0025/kWh of the total electricity sales will be allocated to the Development and Livelihood Fund for the \nresettlement area. ", "14     \nthe construction of seawalls, culverts, multipurpose halls, schools, water tanks, health centers, \nand artificial reefs. After the turnover, EEC intends to engage in discussions with the local \ngovernment unit to identify community projects or initiatives that would be most effective in \ndelivering a better quality of life to the people of Calaca and other communities around the plant.  \n \n62.  Indigenous Peoples. The municipalities of Calaca and Balayan are semi-urban, and \nthere are no indigenous peoples in the project area. \n \n63.  Labor and Workplace Conditions at the Calaca Plant. All of the NPC employees were \nterminated by NPC in February 2003 and were paid severance payments. Those that were \nrehired by NPC, TransCo, and PSALM were taken on as new government service employees \nwith the clear understanding that upon privatization they would be given due notice and a \nseverance  payment  before  termination.  These  arrangements  are  in  accordance  with \ngovernment civil service rules and regulations and national labor standards.38  \n \n64.  Currently, the plant has 288 budgeted positions. As provided for in the APA, EEC will \noffer all plant personnel a contract for 5 months. During this period, their competence and \nqualifications will be assessed and skills mixes identified according to the requirements of the \nnew operational structure. Job classifications will be set, and training opportunities will also be \nidentified. With labor consultations and an objective personnel evaluation system, it is expected \nthat  the  labor  rationalization  process  will  be  nondiscriminatory  and  acceptable  to  ADB  as \ncompliant with recognized labor conventions.  \nE.  Development Impact39 \n65.  The Project would help advance the economic development of the country by promoting \nthe power sector reforms of the Government. It would earn revenues for the Government to \nease its fiscal imbalance, and would also provide reliable and efficient power supply in the \ncountry. Progress in the reform of the power sector would encourage further investments in the \nsector at the appropriate time. It would also introduce competition into the sector and would \nthereby  bring  down  the  costs  of  electricity  over  time.  The  acquisition,  refurbishment,  and \noperation of the Calaca plant by a large and experienced global energy provider would result in \nthe plant achieving operating efficiencies that are consistent with global industry best practices. \nThis would also result in more environmentally sound power generation.   \n \nF.  Economic Evaluation \n66.  The economic analysis of the Project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The Project is expected to provide a net benefit to the \neconomy  by  reducing  national  debt,  replacing  current  generation  with  more  efficient  and \nenvironmentally sound generation, adding new generation capacity, and making the sector \nmore competitive overall, thereby lowering electricity tariffs in the long run. The reduction in \nnational debt is assumed to be the difference between EEC\u2019s payment for the assets and the \ndepreciated economic value of the assets, adjusted for financing for the Project from domestic \nsources. Part of the electricity output from the Project will replace electricity already generated \n                                                 \n38 Labor standards are set under the Philippine Labor Code (Presidential Decree 442 as amended, 1 May 1974). \n39 The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector development, business \nsuccess, and economic sustainability, according to the guidelines for implementing the Good Practice Standards \nfor  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of \nmultilateral development banks. ", " \n  15\nby Calaca (the non-incremental portion), but the electricity will be generated more efficiently. \nThe remaining output will be new generation stemming from the implementation of EEC\u2019s \nrefurbishment plan (the incremental portion). The benefit for the non-incremental portion is the \nopportunity cost the economy \u201csaves\u201d by not having to use more expensive electricity generated \nby less efficient plants. For the incremental portion, the benefit is calculated by valuing the \nadditional electricity output from the Project at the projected WESM spot price. This market price \nreflects  the  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  additional  electricity,  and,  hence,  is  a  good \napproximation  of  the  benefit  to  the  economy  of  Calaca\u2019s  added  electricity  generation. \nEnvironmental benefits are also expected from the Project, but these were not quantified in the \nanalysis. \n \n67.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  under  the  ADB  base  case  was  estimated  at \n39.6%\u2014above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12.0%.  Sensitivity  testing  against  four  adverse \nscenarios demonstrates that the Project is economically robust and viable.  \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Loan \n68.  The proposed ADB assistance consists of a direct loan of up to $120 million to EEC, \nwithout a government guarantee, and a PRG of up to $90 million. The direct loan will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. Part of the loan, may be converted into peso, at \nthe option of EEC to minimize the Project\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange risk.   \n \n69.  The loan will be documented in a loan agreement, which will be subject to conditions \nprecedent to the disbursement, including all necessary government, creditor, and shareholder \napprovals and consents, and all contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nThe loan agreement will include appropriate covenants, representation, and warranties, as well \nas events of default.  \nB.  ADB Political Risk Guarantee \n70.  The PRG will be issued by ADB in favor of the sponsor or one of its affiliates (PRG \nbeneficiary). ADB\u2019s obligation to make payment under the PRG will arise if a political risk causes a \nloss of revenue to the Calaca Power Project and such loss results in EEC\u2019s failure to service its \nobligations under the subordinated loans. These loans, made by commercial banks, will be \nguaranteed by the PRG beneficiary under a comprehensive guarantee. The ADB guarantee will \ncover (i) transfer restriction, (ii) expropriation, (iii) political violence, and (iv) contract disputes.  \nC.  Justification  \n71.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n(i)  It will further the privatization efforts of the Government to promote competition and \nefficiency in the power sector and to put the sector on a sounder financial footing. It \nwill  bring  the  percentage  of  NPC\u2019s  privatized  eligible  assets  to  almost  40%. \nProceeds from the sale of the Calaca plant will be used to reduce PSALM and \nNPC debt. \n(ii)  The Project will increase the electricity supply, improve the operating efficiency of \nthe plant, bring about environmental benefits including air quality improvements ", "16     \nand bring the plant\u2019s health and safety standards up to global standards. The \nCalaca  plant  is  now  underutilized,  operating  inefficiently,  and  violating \nenvironmental, health, and safety standards. \n(iii)  The Project will embody ADB\u2019s country and energy strategies, which emphasize \nsupport for energy infrastructure development with private sector participation. It \nwill support ADB\u2019s thematic priorities of economic development, private sector \ndevelopment, good governance, and environmental protection, and will directly \ncomplement the Philippines\u2019 Power Sector Development Program (para. 35) by \ncatalyzing the privatization of an NPC-owned power plant and earning sales \nrevenues for the Government. The Project will also help improve the investment \nclimate  by  increasing  the  reliability  of  generating  capacity  for  the  economic \ncenter. Successful acquisition and operation of the plant by a reputed foreign \nprivate sector will boost market confidence and induce more foreign investment.  \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s involvement in the Project will catalyze long-term private sector equity and \ndebt by offering protection against political uncertainties, including the risk that \nPSALM will breach its contractual obligations, regulatory risks, and the risk that \nthe Government will fail to complete its sector reform program.  \nD.  Anticorruption Measures and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n72.  EEC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire EEC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best-practice standards to prevent corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \nSuch obligations will be contained in ADB loan and guarantee documentation. The financing \ndocumentation between ADB and EEC will, further, allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \nVI.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n73.  The proposed direct loan and PRG for the Project will, once approved, increase ADB's \ngroup exposure to the Suez group to $260 million, and its total nonsovereign exposure to the \nPhilippines to 11.17% and that to the conventional energy generation subsector to 20.39%. The \nproposed financing is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, industry, group, and single-exposure \nlimits for nonsovereign investments.  \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n74.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nEEC. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \nsuitable  loan  and  guarantee  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nfollowing the approval of the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. ", " \n  17\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n75.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and political risk guarantee would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i)   a  loan  of  up  to  $120,000,000  to  Emerald  Energy  Corporation  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources; and  \n(ii)   a political risk guarantee of up to $90,000,000 in favor of the party providing a \ncredit guarantee of a subordinated loan to Emerald Energy Corporation  \nin each case, for the Privatization and Refurbishment of the Calaca Coal-Fired Thermal Power \nPlant Project and on such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President \n \n28 April 2008 ", "18     Appendix 1      \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \nA reformed power  \u2022 Privatization of 70%  \u2022  Publicly available  \u2022  The Government \nsector that provides an  of NPC power plants  statistics and reports  remains committed to \nefficient and reliable  in Luzon by 2009    privatizing the remaining \nsupply of energy      NPC power plants in \nwithout putting a strain      Luzon. \non government        \nresources    \u2022 Implementation of    \u2022  The Government will \nopen access and    initiate the necessary \nretail competition in    process to implement \nLuzon by 2013    the appointment of \n    IPPAs to manage the \n    take-or-pay contracts of \n    NPC. \n     \n\u2022 An improvement in  \u2022  Financial statements of  \u2022  Proceeds from the asset \nthe financial health  PSALM and NPC   sales would be used to \nof PSALM and NPC    reduce debt. \nby 2015      \nRisk \n\u2022  The power sector reform \ninitiatives will be \nreversed. \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \n\u2022  Increased supply of  \u2022 An increase in the  \u2022  Market assessment  \u2022  New owners of the \nnet dependable  net dependable  reports provided by  privatized plants will \ncapacity in the  capacities of the  PEMC  refurbish the power \nLuzon grid  privatized plants by    plants. \n  2010       \n       \n\u2022  Addition of new  \u2022 A decrease in the    \u2022  Regulatory actions and \nplayers, introducing  average spot-market    decisions reflect the \ncompetition into the  prices to the long-   Government\u2019s continued \nmarket   run marginal costs    support for market \n  by mid-2013     development and fair \n      competition. \n\u2022  No power  \u2022 Timely capacity  \u2022  Publicly available   \ninterruptions  additions to match  information  Risks \nresulting from supply  increased demand    \u2022  The momentum of sector \nshortages  for power    reform slows down. \n       \n      \u2022  Market players collude to \n      frustrate reform efforts. \n     \n       \nOutputs      Assumptions \n\u2022  EEC refurbishment  \u2022 An increase in the  \u2022  Monitoring reports  \u2022  EEC is committed to \nplan designed to  net dependable  submitted by the project  achieving the \nreturn both units to  capacity of the  company and the  performance targets \n ", " \nAppendix 1      19\nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \ntheir original design  Calaca plant by  independent engineer  including environmental, \nspecifications  2010    health, and safety \n      standards. \n  \u2022 An improvement in     \n  the equivalent    \u2022  An effective and \n  availability factor by    collaborative working \n  2011     relation exists between \n      the new owners and \n\u2022  Environmental,  \u2022 Compliance by the  \u2022  Monitoring reports  plant personnel. \nhealth, and safety  Calaca plant with  submitted by the   \nmanagement plans  World Bank  Multipartite Monitoring  \u2022  Continued cooperation \ndesigned to meet  emission standards  Committee  exists between EEC, \nbest global industry  by 2010    government agencies, \npractices      and civil society. \n       \n\u2022  Reduction in carbon  \u2022 Significant  \u2022  Monitoring reports   \ndioxide emissions  improvement in heat  submitted by the project  Risks \nper unit of electricity  rates   company and the  \u2022  There is no support for \ngenerated    independent engineer  the refurbishment plan or \n    for the management and \n  operating systems from \n  plant personnel.  \n   \n   \nActivities with Milestones     \n \n1.

When  it  started  operations,  the  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management \nCorporation (PSALM) identified 31 power plants owned by the National Power Corporation (NPC) \nand with an aggregate capacity of 5,914.1 megawatts (MW) that would have to be privatized.1 By \nthe end of 2007, PSALM had turned over eight of these plants with an aggregate capacity of \n480.5 MW to private entities at a combined price of $664.2 million. In determining the level of \nprivatization for open access and retail competition, however, only 475.4 MW of the already \nprivatized assets are considered. This would represent only 10.96% of the 4,335.7 MW of total \noperating capacity in Luzon and Visayas. Almost all of the plants were purchased by wholly \nowned Filipino companies, except for Magat, which was purchased by a consortium consisting of \nFilipinos and Norwegians. Refer to Table A2.1 for a list of generations assets auctioned by \nPSALM. \n2.  In addition to the eight power plants already privatized, bidding for four other power plants \nwas successfully concluded in 2007 and is now in various stages of financial closure. The \ncombined bid price of these power plants is $2,041.5 million. The successful turnover of these \npower plants, expected to take place in 2008, will bring the total number of installed capacity \nprivatized to 1,855.5 MW, though only 1,850.4 MW, representing about 42.7% of the operating \ncapacity in Luzon and Visayas, would be considered in determining open access and retail \ncompetition.

To achieve the target of selling at least 70% of the total capacity of NPC\u2019s generation \nassets  in  Luzon  and  Visayas,  PSALM  would  need  to  auction  off  about  11  power  plants, \nrepresenting  1,669.3  MW  in  installed  capacity.  PSALM\u2019s  indicative  privatization  schedule \nreleased in July 2007 shows that it intends to achieve this target by the end of 2009, though it \nrecognizes that delays can occur as a result of several factors, including investor interest in \nspecific  power  plants.  (Table  A2.2  provides  a  list  of  NPC  generation  assets  that  will  be \nauctioned by PSALM). To optimize opportunities for the privatization of NPC power plants, \nPSALM would consider selling a mix of plants under a portfolio and bidding them out as one \npackage. The specific timetable for the sale of the remaining assets would be released publicly \na few months before the bid date. \n \nTable A2.2: Generation Assets for Bidding \n \nInstalled Capacity \nPower Plant  Grid  Fuel \n(MW) \nTiwi  Luzon  Geothermal  275.0 \nMakban  Luzon  Geothermal  410.0 \nAngat  Luzon  Hydro  246.0 \nBacman  Luzon  Geothermal  150.0 \nPalinpinon  Visayas  Geothermal  192.5 \nTongonan  Visayas  Geothermal  112.5 \nBohol  Visayas  Diesel  22.0 \nPanay (Dingle)  Visayas  Diesel  146.5 \nAmlan  Visayas  Hydro  0.8 \nIligan 1 and 2  Mindanao  Diesel/Bunker  114.0 \nNavotas I/II  Luzon  Diesel  310.0 \nLimay  Luzon  Diesel/Bunker  620.0 \n  Total  2,599.3 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \n \n4.
