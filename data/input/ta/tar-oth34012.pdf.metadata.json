INTRODUCTION\n1. The United Nations (UN) Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) is an international\ntreaty of contracting states (\u201cParties\u201d) that is directed at land degradation and poverty in dryland\nareas.  In 1999, Asian Development Bank (ADB) accepted an invitation to become a member of\nthe Facilitation Committee of the Global Mechanism of the CCD, for which the World Bank, the\nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and  International  Fund  for  Agricultural\nDevelopment (IFAD) are the founding members. The mandate of the Global Mechanism is to\npromote  effective  mobilization  and  use  of  resources  for  CCD  implementation.  The  Global\nMechanism, in close collaboration with its partner institutions,1 intends to respond to country-\ndriven requests to  assist developing member countries (DMCs) to implement the CCD. The\nregional technical assistance (TA) for Combating Desertification in Asia is intended to assist in\nthis process.2 Further to discussions with CCD national focal points during fact-finding in March\n2000,  as  well  as  consultations  with  the  CCD  Secretariat  and  the  Global  Mechanism,  an\nunderstanding has been reached on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, budget, and\nimplementation arrangements.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The CCD defines desertification to be \u201cland degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-\nhumid areas3 resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.\u201d\nThe  objective  of  the  CCD  is  to  \u201ccombat  desertification  and  mitigate  the  effects  of\ndrought\u2026through effective actions at all levels, supported by international cooperation and\npartnership arrangements, \u2026with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable\ndevelopment  in  affected  areas.  Achieving  this  objective  will  involve  long-term  integrated\nstrategies that focus simultaneously, in affected areas, on improved productivity of the land and\nthe rehabilitation, conservation, and sustainable management of land and water resources,\nleading to improved living conditions, in particular at the community level.\u201d\n3. The CCD provides an internationally agreed framework for arresting dryland degradation\nin  all  developing  regions,  through  national  action  programs  for  policy,  legislative,  and\ninstitutional reforms at the macro level, combined with community-based resource management\nat the local level. Developing Parties to the CCD take on obligations to (i) give due priority to\ncombating  desertification  and  allocate  adequate  resources  for  this  purpose;  (ii)  establish\nstrategies and priorities for desertification control within the framework of national sustainable\ndevelopment plans; (iii) address underlying causes of desertification, paying special attention to\nsocioeconomic factors and poverty; (iv) promote awareness and facilitate full participation of\naffected communities; and (v) provide an enabling macroeconomic, institutional, and legislative\nenvironment.  Obligations  of  developed  Parties  include  (i)  providing  substantial  financial\nresources and other forms of support to implement strategies and programs, and (ii) facilitating\naccess to appropriate technology. Eighteen donor member countries of ADB and 32 DMCs\nhave ratified the CCD.\n                                                \n1  The  partner  institutions  of  the  Global  Mechanism  include  ADB,  CCD  Secretariat,  Food  and  Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO), IFAD, Global Environment Facility (GEF), UNDP, United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP), and the World Bank.\n2  The TA was endorsed by the RETA Screening Committee on 3 December 1999 and first appeared in ADB\nBusiness Opportunities in January 2000.\n3  In the CCD, \u201cArid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas\u201d means areas, other than polar and subpolar regions, in\nwhich the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration falls within the range of 0.05-0.65.", "2\n4. The  CCD  is  relevant  in  Asia  because  the  region\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  rural\ndevelopment prospects depend on the sustainability of land use systems.  According to a UN\nassessment, degradation affects 1,341 million hectares (ha) of agriculturally productive dry\nlands in Asia, or about 70 percent of the total dry lands area. Some 35 percent of all irrigated\nland, 56 percent of rain-fed cropland, and 76 percent of rangelands are degraded. More than 50\npercent of the world\u2019s irrigated lands severely affected by waterlogging and salinization are also\nfound in the region. ADB\u2019s study on measuring environmental quality in Asia4 identifies land\ndegradation  as  the  environmental  problem  with  the  highest  cost  of  remediation.  Hunger,\npoverty, and deprivation remain acute in dry land zones, and population growth during the next\n20 years will place increasing pressure on these marginal areas. As highlighted in ADB\u2019s rural\nAsia  study,5  the  vast  majority  of  Asia\u2019s  rural  population  relies  directly  or  indirectly  on  the\nproductivity of natural resources for household food security. The study also emphasized the\nnatural resource constraints facing equitable agricultural growth, especially on less favored\nlands.\n5. Drought and desertification and the resultant loss of resilience in livelihood systems do\nnot  affect  all  groups  equally.  The  dependence  of  the  poor  on  the  productivity  of  natural\nresources makes them especially vulnerable to land degradation and natural hazards such as\ndrought.  Poor  households  suffer  from  negligible  capital  assets,  ill-defined  or  nonexistent\nproperty rights, limited access to financial services and markets, inadequate safety nets in time\nof drought, absence of technological packages suited to smallholder rainfed agriculture, and\nexclusion from decision making. Without an enabling policy and institutional framework that\nprovides appropriate incentives for resource management, this can result in household coping\nstrategies  that  lead  to  further  environmental  degradation,  increased  vulnerability,  and\nimpoverishment.\n6. In all DMCs, concerted effort is needed to overcome shortcomings of past programs on\ndesertification control, including (i) failure to adopt an integrated and cross-sectoral approach;\n(ii) insufficient interministerial coordination; (iii) inadequate attention to the policy, legislative,\nand institutional enabling environment and the role of incentives; (iv) lack of public participation;\n(v) neglect of social factors, traditional knowledge, and technology transfer; and (vi) weak\npolitical will to confront root causes. There is a need to achieve coherence among the strategic\nplans that already exist, and to make sure that CCD national action programs add value rather\nthan  duplicate  these.  Parties  are  increasingly  aware  that  the  objective  of  national  action\nprogramming  should  be  to  mainstream  CCD  objectives,  promote  policy  integration  across\nsectors,  catalyze  legislative  and  institutional  change,  and  facilitate  capacity  building  and\ninvestment.\n7. Nine ADB DMCs have large land areas within the arid, semiarid and dry subhumid\nzones.  These are the Central Asian republics (CARs): Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,\nTurkemenistan,  and  Uzbekistan;  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC);  India;  Mongolia;  and\nPakistan. According to CCD\u2019s inventory of desertification,6 almost half of the PRC is in arid and\nsemiarid zones.  Estimates of land degradation vary between 8 and 27 percent of total area. In\nMongolia, 30 percent of land is moderately affected by land degradation and 3 percent is\naffected severely. Almost 90 percent of cultivated area is affected by soil erosion. Cultivated\nland per capita is 0.16 ha. Desert pasture types cover 19.4 percent of grazing land. All of\nCentral Asia is in the arid and semiarid zone. About 60 percent of total land area is affected by\n                                                \n4 TA 5542-REG: Study of Environmental Indicators and Indexes, for $418,000, approved on 16 August 1993.\n5  ADB. 2000.

With the exception of Kazakhstan, there is\nlimited cultivated land per capita (between 0.15 ha and 0.35 ha) and much of this suffers from\nwaterlogging and salinization. In India, 76 percent of land area falls within arid, semiarid, and\ndry subhumid zones. Almost all dry lands in India are degraded. About 80 percent of Pakistan is\narid and semiarid and nearly 12 percent is dry subhumid, while 40 percent of irrigated land and\n70 percent of rainfed land is degraded.\n8. Among Asian developing Parties, the nine DMCs identified above have advanced the\nmost in formal CCD implementation. All have ratified the CCD through decision of parliament or\nequivalent, appointed a national focal point, and established a high-level interministerial national\ncoordinating body to review and guide CCD implementation. They have all initiated national\naction programming, while PRC, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan have formulated CCD\nnational plans of various kinds. They have also complied with CCD reporting requirements, by\nsubmitting  national  progress  reports  in  anticipation  of  the  Fourth  Conference  of  Parties  in\nDecember 2000, which will review implementation in Asia. In addition, CARs have started to\nprepare a subregional action  program.\n9. In helping these DMCs, the Global Mechanism and its partner institutions offer policy\ndialogue  expertise  in  environment,  agriculture,  and  rural  development,  together  with  the\nprospect of substantial TA and finance for well-conceived programs for poverty reduction in\ndryland areas. The Global Mechanism has initiated work to assist Parties to convene national\nand subregional forums on partnership building and resource mobilization. The forums will bring\ntogether stakeholders, including civil society and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), to (i)\nintegrate national action programs within sustainable development plans, (ii) identify priority\nareas for intervention, and (iii) build partnerships around mutually agreed areas of collaboration\nin order to mobilize domestic and external resources. The initiatives will be monitored and\nsustained by the national coordinating body, backstopped by the Global Mechanism and the\nCCD Secretariat.\n10. The  Global  Mechanism,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  CCD  Secretariat  and  other\npartner institutions, intends to respond to country-driven requests to convene CCD forums,\nbeginning with the most affected DMCs. TA is required to assist DMCs to review enabling policy\nand institutional and legislative factors, create opportunities for mainstreaming CCD objectives\nin development planning, and identify investment and TA options. In addition, TA is required to\nhelp DMCs tap new and innovative sources of environmental finance. This includes Global\nEnvironment Facility (GEF) Operational Program 12 on Integrated Ecosystem Management,\nwhich will provide grant and concessional financing for land degradation control as it relates to\nthe  GEF  focal  areas  of  biodiversity,  climate  change,  and  international  waters.  The  Clean\nDevelopment Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, for which ADB is providing capacity building\nsupport,7 and other carbon trading arrangements may also offer a new source of finance for\ncarbon sequestration in dryland areas. ADB as the regional development bank for Asia and the\nPacific, and as a partner institution of the Global Mechanism, is in a position to help interested\nDMCs in this area.\n                                                \n7 TA 5861: Capacity Building for Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the Clean Development Mechanism, for\n$385,000, approved on 1 September 1999.", "4\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n11.  The TA will assist DMCs that are Party to the CCD to refine, adopt and implement\nnational action programs to combat desertification in arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid regions.\nB.  Scope\n12. The  TA  will  complement  ongoing  and  planned  activities  in  support  of  CCD\nimplementation. It will be launched at a regional workshop of CCD national focal points that will\ntake  stock  of  CCD  implementation  in  Asia  and  identify  policy,  legislative,  and  institutional\nbarriers to fulfilling CCD objectives. The regional workshop will be organized jointly with the\nGlobal  Mechanism  and  the  CCD  Secretariat.  The  final  list  of  participating  DMCs  will  be\nconfirmed at the workshop.\n13. The TA will finance activities to support selected DMCs to undertake one or more of the\nfollowing: (i) prepare regional, subregional, or national policy/strategy papers to address issues\nidentified  at  the  regional  workshop,  and  strengthen  their  national  action  programming;  (ii)\nconvene  national  and  subregional  forums  on  CCD  implementation,  that  will  bring  together\nstakeholders including civil society and NGOs; and (iii) identify investment, TA, and capacity\nbuilding concepts for financing by developed country Parties; multilateral funding agencies,\nincluding the GEF; and the clean development mechanism (CDM). The national activities will be\nagreed upon during a formal Global Mechanism consultation mission to each participating DMC,\nand will draw upon the participatory consultations that each DMC has undertaken in fulfilling its\nCCD  obligations.  The  activities  will  be  shaped  by  each  participating  country\u2019s  specific\nrequirements and priorities, bearing in mind that each DMC is at a different stage of national\naction programming. In the case of the CARs, it is likely that activities will be carried out on a\nsubregional basis to reflect the needs of the subregional action program. The TA framework is\ngiven in Appendix 1.\n14. The processes supported under the TA are expected to be firmly nested within each\nparticipating country\u2019s institutional framework for CCD, and will become a formal part of the\nwork  program  of  the  Global  Mechanism  and  its  partners.  The  activities  will  be  closely\ncoordinated  with  ADB\u2019s  own  country  operations,  and  the  outputs  will  be  used  by  country\nstrategy and programming missions. Lessons of CCD implementation, including TA supported\nactivities, will be reviewed at the annual meeting of CCD national focal points in 2002.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000.  ADB will finance $250,000 on a grant\nbasis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Global Mechanism will provide $200,000 to be\nadministered by ADB. The Global Mechanism also expects to provide resources on a parallel\ncofinancing basis. The participating governments will provide the salaries of counterpart staff,\noffice equipment, and supplies. Details of the cost estimates and financing arrangements are\nshown in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  regional  level  activities  will  be\nimplemented by the Environment Division of the Office of Environment and Social Development", "5\nin collaboration with the Global Mechanism and in coordination with the CCD Secretariat and\nother relevant international, regional, and subregional institutions. At the country level, the TA\nwill be coordinated closely with the CCD national focal point of each participating DMC. In\nkeeping with the CCD\u2019s emphasis on public participation, the national focal points are expected\nto ensure broad participation of stakeholders in CCD implementation, and this will extend also to\nall  activities  supported  by  the  TA.  Within  ADB,  a  steering  committee  of  ADB  staff  from\nconcerned departments/offices will be constituted to provide guidance. It will also serve as a\nmechanism to associate project departments with TA implementation and promote knowledge\nexchange.\n17. The TA will be carried out over a 14 month period, beginning in October 2000 and\nending in December 2001.  The TA will require the services of an international consultant for a\ntotal of 7 person-months, and domestic consultants for a total of 20 person-months. The number\nof domestic consultants will be decided at TA inception.  The consultants will have expertise in\nenvironmental policy, natural resource management, resource economics, socioeconomics, and\nland management.  ADB and Global Mechanism staff may act as resource persons as required.\n18. The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals.  The\ninternational and domestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are shown in Appendix 3.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the\nadministration by ADB of a portion of the technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $200,000, to be financed by the Global Mechanism of the Convention to Combat\nDesertification, on a grant basis; and (ii) the provision of the balance of technical assistance in\nan amount not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000, to be financed by ADB on a grant basis\nfor the purpose of Combating Desertification in Asia.", "6\nAppendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Indicators/Targets Mechanisms And Risks\nGoal\nTo combat Land degradation trends Data/statistics on land Political will and commitment\ndesertification and reversed, resource degradation and poverty. to address root causes.\nreduce poverty in Asia. constraints to poverty\nreduction reduced.\nPurpose\nTo support developing Effective strategies for National Reports to CCD Political will and commitment\nmember countries promoting CCD Conference of Parties can be harnessed, CCD is\n(DMCs) in the implementation are (COP), number of DMCs recognized as appropriate\nimplementation of the adopted. with CCD National Action framework for combating\nUnited Nations Program to Combat poverty and desertification.\nConvention to Combat Desertification (NAP).\nDesertification (CCD),\nso that goal may be\nachieved.\nOutputs\nStrengthened national Robust national action National reports to CCD.
