The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is willing to undertake comprehensive reform in \nthe rural water supply and sanitation (WSS) subsector, including (i) preparation of a rural WSS \nstrategy,  (ii)  implementation  of  a  rural  WSS  policy,  (iii)  the  establishment  of  strong  and \ncompetent  sector  institutions,  and  (iv)  the  development  of  a  framework  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment and system maintenance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports these \nreforms  and  believes  they  are  necessary  for  efficient  operation  of  the  subsector.1 This  is \nreflected in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132013.2   \n \n2.  The World Bank is providing technical assistance (TA) to develop the rural WSS strategy. \nThe proposed technical assistance (TA) will build on this strategy and implement the remainder \nof the planned reforms. ADB agreed with the government about the objectives and scope of the \nTA, the terms of reference for consultants, and the cost and implementation arrangements.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Most  of  the  rural  water  supply  infrastructure  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  was  built                     \n40\u201350 years ago, during the Soviet period. As built, the water supply systems provided reliable \nservices.  However,  after  independence  from  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the  rural  WSS \ninfrastructure  deteriorated  rapidly.  Rural  WSS  systems,  originally  operated  by  state  and \ncollective  farms,  were  transferred  to  local  governments,  which  did  not  have  the  funds  or \nexpertise to operate them. Most of these systems broke down or were abandoned.  \n \n4.  The decline of the rural WSS sector was temporarily halted and reversed4 by the Taza \nSuu  program.5 So  far,  WSS  systems  in  506  villages  serving  1  million  people  have  been \nconstructed and rehabilitated. However, the improvements achieved by the program seem to be \nshort-lived. Many of the new and rehabilitated systems show signs of deterioration because of \npoor construction and lack of funds for maintenance. Furthermore, the program experienced \nimplementation problems, integrity breaches, and insistence on the use of obsolete technical \nstandards and solutions. Overall, the Taza Suu program was a patchwork program whose \nresults are generally unsustainable.6 \n \n5.  Absence  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  strategy  and  policy. One of the \nprimary hindrances to further development in the rural WSS sector is the absence of a rural \nWSS strategy and policy.7 The rural WSS sector lacks development direction, performance \ntargets, rules and regulations, a progress monitoring mechanism, and means of correcting \ndirection.  Past  efforts to  develop  a  sector  development  policy  and  a  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for rural water asset creation and service delivery, as part of the Community-Based \n                                                \n1  The draft country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 states that these reforms are crucial for further development of \nthe rural WSS sector. \n2  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2012\u20132013. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 April 2013. \n4  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2011.

Bratislava, Slovakia. \n5  The Taza Suu Program is a $70 million rural water supply and sanitation program, started in 2002, comprising the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project and ADB\u2019s Community-Based Infrastructure Services \nSector Project. Taza Suu means clean water in Kyrgyz. \n6  ADB. 2012. No One in Charge: Kyrgyzstan\u2019s Water Supply and Sanitation Sector. Manila; UNDP. 2011.

Bratislava, Slovakia. \n7  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank have previously \nprepared strategies for WSS sector. However, none of these strategies were adopted. \n ", "2 \nInfrastructure Services Sector Project,8 were unrealized. However, the government commitment \nto developing the rural WSS subsector is increasing. Rural WSS has been included in the most \nrecent  Kyrgyz  Republic  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132014.  The  World  Bank  is \ndeveloping  a  high-level  participatory  rural  WSS  strategy  that  will  outline  the  vision  for \ndevelopment of the subsector.9 This strategy will be completed by May 2013. The proposed \nactivities under this TA are designed to complement World Bank efforts and to operationalize \nthe vision presented in the strategy.  \n \n6.  Sector  governance.  The  Department  of  Drinking  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage \nDevelopment, under the State Agency for Construction and Communal Services (SACCS), is \nthe  only  central  government  agency  operating  in  the  WSS  subsector.  This  department  is \nresponsible for the development of WSS. However, it has a low level of authority and capacity, \nas it was only created in 2012 after the new government took charge. In its previous forms, the \ndepartment was frequently moved between ministries and agencies. SACCS\u2019s experience in \nWSS and in working with development partners is very limited. \n \n7.  Sector  operations  and  performance.  Community  Drinking  Water  Users  Unions \nmanage the rural WSS systems built or rehabilitated under the Taza Suu program. Rural WSS \nsystems not addressed by the Taza Suu program operate directly under local government \nadministration. Rural WSS services are poorly delivered because of (i) financing gaps resulting \nfrom low revenues caused by low tariff bases and poor collection, (ii) asset deterioration caused \nby insufficient funds for maintenance and reinvestment, (iii) ineffective organization of service \nprovision, (iv) lack of skilled personnel, (v) reliance on outdated and inefficient construction \nnorms and standards, and (vi) poor sector regulation and management. The indicators are, at \nbest, estimates since the users unions and rural WSS systems operated by local government \n(service providers) do not collect reliable data. The key issues are:10   \n(i)  Low water supply coverage: 50%\u201360% in rural areas  \n(ii)  Non-potable water: 2% of chemical and 10% of microbiological tests failed  \n(iii)  Insufficient hours of supply: 4\u201320 hours of water supply per day \n(iv)  High water losses: Level of losses is unknown, but estimated to be 35%\u201345% \n(v)  Low sanitation coverage: Less than 25% of rural population  \n \n8.  ADB  support  for  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Since  2001,  ADB  has  provided \n$66 million  for  rural WSS  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  including  the  community-based \ninfrastructure project and the Supplementary Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector \nProject, financed by both loans and grants. Both of these projects faced major implementation \ndifficulties. Implementation issues in the community-based infrastructure project included (i) cost \noverruns; (ii) weak administration; (iii) poor selection of subprojects; (iv) poor performance of \nconsultants, design institutes, and contractors; (v) poor execution of works, with substandard or \neven secondhand equipment being installed; and (vi) poor sustainability of subprojects.

Implementation issues \nidentified in the supplementary project included (i) low capacity of government implementation \nstaff;  (ii)  poor  application  of  selection  criteria  to  identify  subprojects;  (iii)  unsustainable \ninstitutional models, operations, and maintenance practices; (iv) poor supervision and execution \nof works; and (v) noncompliance with covenants and violations of ADB procedures, including \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). Based on the findings of the Office of \nAnticorruption and Integrity\u2019s Project Procurement-Related Review conducted in March 2012, \nADB suspended the project in May 2012.11 \n \n9.  External assistance. In addition to ADB, the Department for International Development \nof the United Kingdom (DFID) and the World Bank have supported projects in rural WSS \nthrough (i) the  World Bank- and DFID-funded Rural WSS 1 and 2 projects (part of Taza Suu), \nand (ii) the World Bank-funded Small Towns project. All of these projects faced implementation \nproblems. DFID withdrew from the rural WSS because of poor results of the Taza Suu program. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  To address the identified deficiencies, it is proposed to support the creation of a robust \ngovernance framework and institutions for the rural WSS subsector\u2014to enable the execution of \nthe rural WSS strategy, which is currently being prepared. The proposed TA will focus on four \nmain areas: \n(i)  Build  a  strong  institutional  framework  by  clearly  defining  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of institutions and building their capacity to fulfill those roles and \nresponsibilities.  \n(ii)  Prepare a rural WSS policy that will create an enabling environment for the delivery \nof sustainable, good quality WSS services at a reasonable cost.  \n(iii)  Synthesize  lessons from  past  experiences  by  building  on  reports  prepared  by \nADB\u2019s Kyrgyz Republic Resident Mission to include technical aspects of projects, \nproject management aspects, and projects from other development partners.  \n(iv)  Monitor  the  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  demonstration  activities  and \nassess the quality of designs and construction, and sustainability. \n \n11.  The  first  two  tasks  are  expected  to  improve  rural  WSS  sector  governance,  and \nsubsequently, sector performance. They will address the sector-wide problems identified in the \nrisk  assessment  report.  A  strengthened  institutional  framework,  combined  with  capacity \ndevelopment, will strengthen or create institutions to be able to fulfill their roles and deliver high \nquality WSS services effectively. To achieve this, the proposed TA will (i) define the approach to \nfilling the governance gap; (ii) design a rural WSS institutional framework to include all levels, \nfrom  national  level  institutions  to  village  level  service  provision;  (iii)  define  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of these institutions; (iv) design mechanisms to minimize corruption; (v) define \nthe capacity development needs of institutions; and (vi) design and deliver essential training.  \n \n12.  The rural WSS  policy  will  give  the  institutions the  mandate,  authority,  and  tools  to \noperationalize the rural WSS strategy. Rural WSS policy will include (i) regulatory and service \nmonitoring  mechanisms  (including  revised  water  quality  standards);  (ii)  tariff  and  subsidy \nmechanisms; (iii) revised rural WSS technical standards (i.e., compatible with standards of \ninternational water associations); (iv) operation and maintenance (O&M) plans and guidelines; \n(v)  rural  WSS  asset  ownership  regulations;  (vi)  a  standardized  design  approach  and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2012. Project Procurement-Related Review Report for the Supplementary Asian Development Fund Grant to \nKyrgyz Republic for the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project. Manila. \n ", "4 \nprocurement plans for rural WSS systems; (vii)  a benchmarking and information gathering \nprogram; (viii) a WSS professionals training plan; and (ix) sector coordination, support, and a \nknowledge-sharing plan. These first two tasks will create a solid sector governance framework. \nAs a result, stronger and more competent institutions will apply these policies and improve \nsector performance through the enforcement of new service standards, O&M guidelines, tariffs \nand subsidies, and through improved capacity, knowledge sharing, and information availability. \n \n13.  The second group of tasks will improve project implementation. The report on project \nlessons, building on risk assessment and procurement review reports, will add technical, project \nmanagement, and compliance perspective to the existing work. It will also add lessons from \nother development partner projects and include a willingness-to-pay survey. The report on \nproject lessons will provide guidelines on how to address identified implementation problems.  \n \n14.  The government is planning a series of demonstration projects and rectification actions, \nto be designed by the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development. They \nare meant to rectify the non-functioning or poorly functioning subprojects financed by ADB \nunder the Taza Suu program and to ensure these subprojects deliver acceptable levels of \nservice. The government will, at its own cost, finance all the equipment and civil works required \nto make these subprojects operational. These projects are meant to demonstrate that the \ngovernment has the capacity to implement rural WSS projects successfully. The proposed TA \nwill monitor and assess the government demonstration projects and rectification actions by \n(i) conducting  a technical  review  of the  designs  and  systems  as constructed,  (ii) gathering \ncommunity feedback about the projects, and (iii) analyzing project finances to ensure financial \nsustainability.  The  findings  of  this  activity  will  be  used  to  guide  subsequent  programming \nfinanced by ADB in rural WSS. \n \n15.  The government requested the proposed TA, and it is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2012\u20132013.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the proposed TA is delivery of improved rural WSS services. The outcome \nof the TA is the establishment of institutional arrangements for rural WSS services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The outputs will be prepared in close coordination with the World Bank TA. The outputs \nmust be designed to complement and enable the execution of the rural WSS strategy, under \npreparation. During the preparation of each output, the key local stakeholders need to be \nconsulted to ensure strong local ownership. The TA will result in the following outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Rural water supply and sanitation policy adopted. Adoption of a rural \nWSS policy will give the institutions in the rural WSS subsector the mandate, \nauthority, and tools needed to manage the development of rural WSS and improve \nservice delivery.   \n(ii)  Output 2: Capacity development program developed. This program will ensure \nthat the roles and responsibilities of all rural WSS institutions are clearly defined. \nFurthermore, it will provide these institutions with the required skills to fulfill their \nroles and responsibilities effectively. \n(iii)  Output  3:  Framework  for  infrastructure  development  and  system \nmaintenance developed. This framework will improve the technical operations in \nthe rural WSS sector. O&M guidelines will ensure sustainable and efficient delivery \nof services. A new design approach, technical standards, procurement plans, and \n ", "5 \nmechanisms to minimize corruption will ensure new infrastructure is well designed, \ncost-effective,  efficient  to  operate,  and  effectively  procured.  Technical \nimprovements  will  be  monitored  through  an  information  gathering  and \nbenchmarking  plan.  Consistent  service  delivery  will  be  enforced  through  the \nservice standards. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $810,000 of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and their travel and per diem, office facilities, \nmeeting  avenues  for  workshops,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  SACCS will be the TA executing agency and the Department of Drinking Water Supply \nand Sewerage Development will be the implementing agency. The government will form a \nworking group that includes the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Ministry of Finance, and SACCS. This \ngroup will approve the TA outputs and promote proposed reforms of WSS. \n \n20.  ADB will engage individual consultants to implement the proposed TA, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as  amended from time to time). \nIndividual consultants are being used rather than a firm in order to (i) increase the speed of \nprocurement, (ii) obtain a specific mix of skills, and (iii) eliminate any undue influence on the \noutputs from local design institutes. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  A  team  of  international  consultants  (21  person-months)  and  national  consultants \n(18 person-months) will develop the TA outputs. The team will include four international and \nthree national consultants. The consultants should have expertise in regulatory and institutional \nmatters, communications, finance, economics, WSS, and Kyrgyz law. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB-\nadministered TA. Good practice and lessons will be disseminated through policy dialogues with \nthe government and in seminar and training materials and knowledge products published under \nthe TA. An evaluation of performance and outcomes will be carried out at the end of the TA and \nreflected in the TA completion report. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented from May 2013 through November 2014. Final outputs will \nbe available in November 2014. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for the Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and Reporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved rural WSS  At least 25% of rural WSS  Benchmarking program  Government remains \nservices  service providers meet  instituted under the proposed  committed to reform the rural \nnational service and  TA  WSS sector  \nperformance standards by     \n2017     Risk \n     \n80% of rural WSS service  Benchmarking program  Weak implementation of the \nproviders participate in the  instituted under the proposed  institutional arrangements by \nbenchmarking program by  TA  national government and \n2017    local governments \n     \n80% of rural WSS service  Benchmarking program \nproviders report utility and  instituted under the proposed \nWSS data to the public by  TA \n2017   \n   \nNew tariff and subsidy regime  Benchmarking program \nimplemented by all rural WSS  instituted under the proposed \nservice providers by 2017  TA \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nInstitutional arrangement  Government approves rural  MOU for final TA review  Professionals trained through \nestablished for rural WSS  WSS sector institutional  mission  the TA remain employed \nservices   framework by end of 2013    within the rural WSS sector \n     \nInformation gathering and  MOU for final TA review   \nbenchmarking program  mission   \ninitiated by mid-2014     \n   \nKey WSS professionals,  MOU for final TA review \ncurrently working for service  mission \nproviders  understand and   \napply infrastructure   \ndevelopment, system   \noperation and maintenance,   \nand financial management   \nprinciples by end of 2014   \n   \nStaff from Institutions  MOU for final TA review \nimplementing the rural WSS  mission \npolicy understand key   \nprinciples and are \nimplementing the policy by end \nof 2014 \nOutputs       Assumption \n       \n1.
