INTRODUCTION \n1.  Poor governance and corruption deter investment, waste resources and distort their \nallocation, undermine the credibility of authorities, and increase insecurity. On 31 July 2006, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) approved the second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan (GACAP II), which aims to improve ADB\u2019s performance in implementing governance and \nanticorruption policies in sectors where ADB is active. At the same time, the Pacific Plan\u2019s goal \nis  to  enhance  economic  growth,  sustainable  development,  good  governance,  and  security \nthrough regionalism. In October 2005, Pacific Island Forum (PIF) leaders, in consideration of \nsubstantial benefits accruing from regional cooperation,1 endorsed for further study and analysis \nPacific Plan initiative 12.1, which includes the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative (PRAI).   \n \n2.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  design  of  the  PRAI  and  the  pilot \nimplementation of GACAP II in Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) of ADB. The TA is \nconsistent with the Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005-2009,2 which identifies \nas a key result area, strengthened government transparency and accountability. Moreover, in \nsupporting the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,3 recipient countries have committed \nto publishing timely, transparent, and reliable (audited) financial reports, while development \npartners (including ADB) have, among other things, committed to relying to the maximum extent \npossible  on  country  public  financial  management  systems.4 The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  GACAP II reaffirmed the findings of an earlier review6 that identified the need for action in \nthe following critical areas: (i) filling the significant gaps in compliance with the governance and \nanticorruption policies and relevant operations manuals and project administration instructions; \n(ii)  building  stronger  partnerships  with  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  institutions, \nparticularly in accessing country diagnostics and strengthening countries\u2019 procurement systems \nand public financial management; (iii) more effectively applying institutional knowledge and \ncountry and sector diagnostics to determine focus and priorities; and (iv) instituting more flexible, \nlonger-term institutional development arrangements to address systemic weaknesses in sector \ngovernance and corruption. Implementing GACAP II will enable ADB\u2019s DMCs in partnership with \nADB,  and  with  civil  society  involvement,  to  design  and  deliver  better  quality  projects  and \nprograms. \n \n4.  Effective  public  auditing  underpins  good  governance  and  accountability.  In  that \nconnection, regionalism is not new to Pacific public auditors\u23afthey are represented by the South \nPacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (SPASAI),7 which is a regional working group \n                                                 \n1  ADB and Commonwealth Secretariat. 2005.

Review of the Implementation of the Governance and Anticorruption Policies. Manila (December). \n7  Founded in 1987, SPASAI\u2019s primary objectives include promoting understanding and cooperation among member \ninstitutions, providing facilities for training and continuing education for government auditors\u2014with a view to \nimproving  the  quality  of  their  performance,  serving  as  a  center  of  information  and  as  a  regional  link  with \norganizations and institutions in other parts of the world, promoting closer collaboration and brotherhood among \n ", "2   \nof the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).8 In December 2005, \nthe PIF Secretariat (PIFS) agreed that ADB would work in coordination with PIFS to move the \nPRAI forward. ADB consulted with SPASAI and its member supreme audit institutions (SAIs) to \ndevelop  awareness  of  and  seek  support  for  the  PRAI. 9  The  2006  SPASAI  Congress \nsubsequently agreed in principle to the PRAI.  \n \n5.  An SAI exists in each Pacific jurisdiction (Appendix 2). But the effectiveness of Pacific \nSAIs is generally limited by their ability to attract, retain, and develop qualified staff due to their \nsmall sizes and remote locations, difficulties in competing with the private sector for qualified \nstaff, often-constrained budgets, and limited access to professional accounting bodies. However, \nthere is a range of capacities, with some Pacific SAIs meeting best practice in many respects. \nMoreover,  SPASAI  membership  is  diverse  with  members  from  developed  and  developing \ncountries; British, French, and United States (US)-influenced systems; and varying regional \nmemberships.  \n \n6.  ADB has provided four TA grants to SPASAI since 1989, some of which were supported \njointly by the INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI).10 A 2002 review of efforts to strengthen \nPacific audit capability concluded that intended benefits were achieved but much more remained \nto be done.11 Lessons learned included the need to thoroughly diagnose requirements, address \nlegal independence and mandate issues, and address accounts-preparation issues. To provide \ncontextual information, SPASAI prepared a membership stocktaking in May 2006, which identified \nthe following issues. \n \n7.  Audit  Scope,  Quality,  and  Timeliness.  Most  Pacific  SAIs  conduct  financial  and \nperformance audits, but only the Cook Islands, Fiji, and Palau undertake environmental audits. \nFinancial audit quality varies significantly and capacity constraints mean that several SAIs are \nunable to meet their audit obligations. Meanwhile, several SAIs have audit backlogs due to \nlimited capacity and or nonprovision of financial reports for audit. One SAI has arrears of 9 years \nand several are in arrears by 3\u20134 years. Nevertheless, SAIs have made sound progress in \nclearing outstanding backlogs in recent years and continued efforts are planned. \n \n8.  Accounting and Auditing Standards. Financial reporting and auditing standards vary \nacross jurisdictions. For instance, US-affiliated jurisdictions are mandated to follow generally \naccepted government auditing standards (GAGAS or the Yellow Book), while others have their \nown standards or intend to harmonize with international benchmarks. Most SAIs are challenged \nby the introduction of new and emerging standards. \n \n9.  Professional Qualifications and Training. The prevalence varies, but few SAIs have \nsuitable  levels  of  professionally  qualified  staff.  US-affiliated  jurisdictions  rely  on  the  US \nprofessional system, but among other SPASAI members, only three\u23afFiji, Samoa, and Papua \n                                                                                                                                                           \nauditors in the government service among regional groups, assisting each other by providing technical assistance, \nand exchanging of expertise that will benefit members.  \n8  INTOSAI, established in 1953, is the professional organization of SAIs in countries that belong to the United \nNations or its specialized agencies. \n9  Consultations included discussions with SPASAI members, PIFS, and development partners at conferences and \nworkshops in Suva, Fiji (26 February\u20133 March 2006); Port Moresby (January\u2013April 2006); Nadi, Fiji (6\u20137 April \n2006); and Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (18\u201326 May 2006). \n10  IDI was established in 1986 as INTOSAI\u2019s training arm. Its mission is to help SAIs, especially in developing \ncountries, to improve their audit capacity and resolve audit issues through training and information sharing. \n11  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance Performance Audit Report on Strengthening Audit Capability in the Pacific. Manila \n(October). \n ", "  3\nNew Guinea (PNG)\u23afhave local professional accounting bodies.12 This makes it difficult for staff \nto  attain  professional  qualifications.  Ongoing  professional  development  and  staff  training  is \ncritical to enable SAIs to deliver their mandates\u23afmost training is provided by SPASAI through \nIDI and by the Association of Pacific Island Public Auditors (APIPA) through the Pacific Islands \nTraining Initiative (PITI). The quality of training provided is considered high, but follow-up and \nmonitoring could be improved. \n \n10.  Resources and Technical Support. For some SAIs, resources are limited compared to \nmandated activities. While generally low, staff turnover is high in those SAIs such as Cook \nIslands,  Fiji,  and  Samoa  that  have  managed  to  professionalize.  The  departure  of  most \nprofessionally  qualified  staff  is  for  external  opportunities  and  further  studies  overseas.  A \ncompetent  technical  support  function  is  essential  to  effective  auditing,  but  SAIs  lack  the \neconomies of scale that are necessary to establish and operate such a function on a sustainable \nbasis. \n \n11.  Kiribati,  Nauru,  and  Tuvalu  have  indicated  to  ADB  and  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) their interest in investigating design options for a subregional \napproach to public auditing.  \n \n12.  The  issues  identified  are  broad  in  scope  and  vary  across  the  region.  SPASAI  has \neffectively managed audit training and networking options, but with its very limited resources has \nbeen unable to address other issues\u2014the PRAI development provides an opportunity to do so. \nTo that end SPASAI identified certain key PRAI design considerations: (i) SAI autonomy and \nindependence must be preserved; (ii) a regional approach is appropriate for addressing common \nissues, but SPASAI members will continue to have individual needs; and (iii) the PRAI should \napply to all SPASAI members, not just to PIF or ADB members. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  proposed  project  is  intended  to  promote  good  governance  through  improved \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in  managing  and  using  public  resources  in  the \nPacific.13 Specifically, the project is intended to strengthen the governance and anticorruption \norientation of country partnership strategies (CPSs) and ADB projects and TAs in the Pacific. It \nis also intended to provide a basis for raising public auditing to uniformly high standards across \nthe  Pacific  region,  beginning  with  the  diagnosis  of  SAI  and  region-wide  issues  and  the \nsubsequent development of the PRAI design and road map, which will be considered at the \n2007 SPASAI Congress. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  Governance Component. Assessing public financial management, procurement, and \ncorruption risks is an important starting point for formulating DMC development plans and CPSs. \nDrawing on assessment methodologies and tools that ADB is developing, and with civil society \ninput,  the  component  will  support  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  governance, \ninstitutional, and corruption risk assessments and risk management plans at the country, sector, \n                                                 \n12 The  predominant  professional  bodies  in  the  Pacific  region  are  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  Public \nAccountants, CPA Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, and the New Zealand Institute of \nChartered Accountants. \n13  Pacific Plan, initiative 12. \n ", "4   \nand project levels. It will also support training for government officials, project staff, and civil \nsociety organizations on the application of relevant ADB policies and guidelines.14 \n \n15.  PRAI  Component.  Expected  TA  outputs  comprise:  (i)  identifying  the  good-practice \nfeatures of an SAI, including mandate, independence, management policies and procedures, \naudit  procedures  and  methodologies,  auditing  standards,  and  resources;  (ii)  identifying  the \nstatus  of  20  individual  SAIs,15 including  consideration  of  the  public  financial  management \nenvironment, the status of private sector auditing, and the mechanisms by which the legislature \nand the public scrutinize audit findings, including an analysis of civil society engagement; (iii) \nanalyzing  regionwide  issues  including  education  and  training,  professional  qualifications, \nindependence,  financial  auditing,  performance  auditing,  standards,  information  technology \noptions,  and  institutional  arrangements\u23afthe  diagnosis  will  identify  factors  that  facilitate \nsuccessful  SAI  transformations;  (iv)  analyzing  opportunities  and  presenting  options  for \nestablishing a subregional approach to public auditing for Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu; and (v) \ndeveloping an agreed upon PRAI design and road map that addresses SPASAI institutional \narrangements and does not weaken existing private sector auditing. The PRAI design and road \nmap will also identify PRAI\u2019s intermediate and long-term goals, identify issues that must be \naddressed to reach those goals, and present a road map for reaching them (including resource \nand structural implications, and monitoring and evaluation indicators).16 To accomplish these \nobjectives, activities will be undertaken in three phases.17 \n \n16.  Phase 1: Identify Benchmarks. SAI good practice features will be identified and a \ndiagnostic design and plan\u23afincluding a detailed questionnaire\u23afwill be prepared. These will be \nreviewed and confirmed by the SPASAI Regional Institutional Strengthening Committee (RISC). \n \n17.  Phase  2:  Diagnosis.  Using  identified  SAI  benchmarks,  diagnostic  studies  will  be \nprepared for 20 SPASAI members. It is envisaged that this will require field visits to most of \nthese SAIs, beginning with Fiji. A regionwide diagnosis of issues will also be undertaken and will \ninclude identifying factors that facilitate successful SAI transformations. A RISC workshop will \nreview progress and provide guidance on the preliminary diagnostic work, beginning with the \ndraft Fiji diagnostic report. It is envisaged that this first 3-day RISC workshop will be convened in \nSuva, Fiji, in February 2007.18 \n \n18.  Phase 3: Road Map and Subregional Design Options. The PRAI design and road \nmap  will  be  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  diagnostic  work  and  RISC  consultations.  The \ndiagnostic  work  will  also  provide  a  basis  for  identifying  design  options  for  establishing  a \nsubregional approach to public auditing for Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. A second 5-day RISC \nworkshop in August 2007 will review the completed diagnostic work and consider preliminary \nproposals for the PRAI design and road map.19 The workshop will also review the proposed \n                                                 \n14  Activities will be coordinated with ADB TA 6211-REG (ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for \nProject Implementation and Administration. Manila (for $800,000, approved on 17 December). \n15  All SPASAI members plus Chuuk and Kosrae, but excluding Australia and the Australian states, New Caledonia, \nNew Zealand, Niue, and Tokelau. In the interest of economy, three studies will be prepared either by desk review or \nthrough country representatives visiting the consultants in a joint location. \n16  The approach taken to designing the 2005 Pacific Judicial Development Program might be considered. \n17  Pacific Plan Initiative 12.1 also includes consideration of the establishment of a regional ombudsman service. The \nPIFS  is  analyzing  options  in  this  respect  with  support  from  AusAID  and  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP). Given similarities, efforts will be made to coordinate PRAI design activities with the regional \nombudsman design activities. \n18  The Suva location is appropriate given the workshop\u2019s focus on the draft Fiji diagnostic report. \n19  The  workshop\u2019s  location  is  yet  to  be  decided  on.  Options  include  either  Manila  (ease  of  travel  from  the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and PNG) or Wellington (SPASAI Secretariat location). \n ", "  5\nsubregional design options, which will be finalized subsequently. The revised PRAI design and \nroad map will be presented in October 2007 for consideration and endorsement by the 2007 \nSPASAI Congress in PNG and will be finalized subsequently. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $1,979,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan ($982,500) and by \nthe Government of Australia ($596,500). ADB will administer these funds. Government share of \nthe  cost  will  comprise  $400,000  and  will  involve  in-kind  contributions  from  participating \ngovernments (Appendix 3).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the governance component and the SPASAI \nSecretariat will be the EA for the PRAI component.20 The RISC will provide oversight and \nguidance to the SPASAI Secretariat (in a steering committee-type role). \n \n21.  The governance component will require international consultants (9 person-months) and \nnational consultants (10 person-months) with governance, financial management, procurement, \nand anticorruption skills. Given the intermittent need and multiple skills required, consultants for \nthis component will be engaged as individuals.  \n \n22.  PRAI phase 1 activities will be undertaken by an individual public auditing expert (1.5 \nperson-months of international consulting services), who will prepare a report identifying SAI \ngood-practice features. PRAI phase 2 and 3 activities will be undertaken by a consulting firm, \nwhich will supply 31 person-months of international consulting services. It is highly desirable that \nthe  firm  demonstrates  previous  successful  experience  working  in  the  Pacific  Islands  on \nregionwide projects; ideally in both US- and non-US-influenced countries. The firm will provide \nexperts in public auditing, education and professional qualifications, information technology, and \nlegal matters. The consultants will organize RISC workshops in February 2007 and August 2007 \nto review progress and provide guidance. The consultants will also organize a workshop at the \n2007 SPASAI Congress at which the PRAI will be presented. Appendix 4 details deliverables \nand reporting requirements. The quality- and cost-based selection procedure will be followed to \nselect the consulting firm. Short-listed firms will submit full technical proposals. \n \n23.  All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006). Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. \nTA activities will be implemented over a 36-month period starting in December 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $596,500 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $982,500 to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan, for Strengthening Governance and Accountability in \nPacific Island Countries. \n                                                 \n20  The Office of the Controller and Auditor General of New Zealand currently performs the SPASAI Secretariat \nfunction on a voluntary basis. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \nImproved governance,  \u2022  All CPSs beyond 2008  \u2022  GACAP II  \u2022  Countries remain \ntransparency and  incorporate governance  implementation  committed to \naccountability in   and corruption risk  reports  implement governance \nmanaging and using   assessments and  \u2022  PRAI status  and corruption risk \npublic resources in the  management plans.  reports  management \nPacific  \u2022  Reduced audit  \u2022  Public  strategies. \ncapacity gap between SAIs expenditure and  \u2022  SAIs remain \n\u2022  Improved usefulness,  financial  committed to SPASAI. \nquality, and timeliness of  accountability  \u2022  PRAI is supported \npublic financial information  public financial  by SPASAI and its \nmanagement  members. \nperformance \nmeasurement \nframework \nindicators \nOutcomes       \nStrengthened  \u2022  CPSs and projects  \u2022  GACAP II and  \u2022  Countries accept \ngovernance and  incorporate governance  ADB-OECD  ownership and \nanticorruption  and corruption risk  anticorruption  leadership of \norientation of CPSs  assessments and  initiative progress  governance and \nand ADB projects  management plans.  reports  corruption risk \n      mitigation plans. \n       \nAn agreed-upon design  \u2022  2007 SPASAI  \u2022  Minutes of  \u2022  SPASAI members \nand road map for a  Congress endorsement of  2007 SPASAI  continue working \nlong-term regional  PRAI analysis and road  Congress  together collegially and \napproach to raise  map     productively. \nPacific public auditing  \u2022  Consultant   \nto uniformly high  reports  \u2022  Presence of local \nstandards  champions \n \nOutputs       \n1.
