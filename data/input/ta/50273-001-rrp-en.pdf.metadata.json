THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  After several decades of rapid urbanization and industrialization, the PRC has emerged \nas one of the most water-stressed countries in the world.1 The country\u2019s freshwater resources \nper-capita are one-quarter of the world\u2019s average and are threatened by increasing depletion from \nwidespread environmental degradation and rising demand. Most PRC cities and counties face \nchallenges to the quality, accessibility, and sustainability of water. As a result, an estimated 678 \nmillion citizens live in areas of acute water scarcity.2 Trends in urbanization and consumption are \nanticipated to continue and, along with accelerating climate change, will increase water stress still \nfurther.3 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has described insufficient access to clean water as \none of the PRC\u2019s most pressing bottlenecks to economic growth in the period to 2030.4 \n \n3.  Recognizing this challenge, the government is taking measures to increase water security \nthrough  improved  efficiency.  National  policies  increasingly  emphasize  effective  planning, \nsustainable resource management, and improved sector performance.5 In the municipal setting, \nsuch measures include reducing nonrevenue water through technical and managerial means, \nmaximizing recycling through closed-loop systems, and reducing the water intensity of economic \nactivity, among others.6 The government has also sought to improve sector governance and \nexpand the role of economic and market mechanisms (footnote 2). \n \n4.  One area of partial success has been the government\u2019s gradual but sustained efforts to \npromote private sector participation. While progress is evident, it also remains partial: (i) 70% of \nwater supply projects and around 50% of wastewater treatment projects are still fully under \ngovernment ownership and management (footnote 1); and (ii) pipeline networks, including water \ndistribution and sewage pipelines, are overwhelmingly under public ownership. However, with \nsubstantial investments required to address the PRC\u2019s water infrastructure needs, and given the \nlimited self-financing capacity of local governments, the opportunity for further contributions of \nprivate capital is significant. This involves not only constructing new plants, but also upgrading \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

Local \ngovernments also increasingly look to arrange public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) that include \nrefurbishment and maintenance of pipeline networks. Research by ADB has determined that \nprivate-invested water utilities in the PRC outperform municipal-owned ones. Increased private \nsector ownership and scope of operation in water infrastructure is expected to improve operational \nefficiency and help achieve the government\u2019s water efficiency and quality goals.7 \n \n5.  CWA, a private-sector pioneer, is implementing a new business model of integrated urban \nwater  management  in  which  multiple  services  in  a  single  municipality\u2014water  treatment, \ndistribution, sewage collection networks, wastewater treatment, and drainage pipelines\u2014are \ngrouped together under unified development and operation. Already piloted in several cities, \nCWA\u2019s approach targets reductions in capital and operational costs, operational synergies, and \nimproved planning and streamlined oversight for local governments.8 \n \n6.  The proposed project would be the third phase of collaboration between ADB and CWA. \nAn initial project, approved in 2011, supported CWA\u2019s investment in municipal water supply \nnetworks (i.e., treatment and distribution), with a focus on improving the service quality of PRC \nurban water utilities under private sector management.9 A second project, approved in 2013, \nfocused on linking CWA\u2019s water distribution networks in urban areas with surrounding rural \ncommunities, thereby increasing the access of rural households to safe, affordable water.10 To \ndate,  the  assistance  has  funded  23  subprojects  with  an  aggregate  supply  capacity  of \napproximately 1.5 million cubic meters (m3) per day and development benefits that have been \npublicized by ADB.11 Building on the success of this partnership, CWA requested ADB\u2019s support \nto scale up its operations in integrated urban water management, including its traditional core \nbusiness of municipal water supply and its emerging role in wastewater management. \n \n2.  Project Design \n7.  The project will support the construction and operation of a series of PPPs in second- and \nthird-tier cities covering a combination of (i) water treatment and distribution, (ii) wastewater \ntreatment, and (iii) sewage pipelines.12 Under the project, ADB will disburse funds to CWA and \nGT on a subproject-by-subproject basis, subject to defined environmental, social, developmental, \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

Manila. The project involved \nan A loan of $100 million in US dollar and yuan and a B loan of $100 million funded by ADB\u2019s syndicate of 18 \ncommercial banks. In this report, municipal water supply is used to refer to water treatment and distribution activities \nand related infrastructure.  \n10 ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for the Urban\u2013\nRural Integration Water Distribution Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. The project involved an A loan \nof $100 million in US dollar and yuan and a B loan of $200 million funded by 19 commercial banks. \n11 For example, see ADB. 2014. Clean Water for Millions. Together We Deliver: 10 Stories from ADB-Supported \nProjects with Clear Development Impacts. Manila. Initial lessons from the two projects are described in Client \nInformation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n12 Tier systems are widely used in the PRC to classify cities. While there is no official definition, \u201csecond-tier\u201d cities in \nthis report refers to provincial capitals and sub-provincial, capitals while \u201cthird-tier\u201d refers to prefectural capitals. \nHistorically, larger cities (including \u201cfirst-tier\u201d, or central government-controlled, cities) have benefitted from larger \nallocations of fixed asset investment, leading to disparities in the level of public infrastructure and quality of municipal \nservices. World Bank. 2012. China Small and Medium Towns Overview. Washington, DC. \n ", "  3 \nand financial criteria.13 Subprojects will be identified during the project implementation stage and \nwill be selected to emphasize aspects of integration across various types of water infrastructure. \n \n8.  Each subproject will involve a PPP arrangement with a municipal government and will \nfollow template contracts set forth in national concession guidelines.14 In each case, the specific \ninfrastructure will depend on development and environmental needs as determined by local \ngovernments. The facilities will be required to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguards and other policy \nrequirements. \n \n9.  The project is designed to increase private sector participation in the urban water sector \nthrough PPP. By supporting a participant whose investment plan targets multiple, interlocking \nwater facilities to be developed and operated synergistically, the project can also demonstrate the \ncontributions of PPP to integrated urban water management. The project will bundle projects \ntypically too small and expensive for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. \nAs such, the project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing smaller-scale water and \nwastewater management projects in the PRC. \n \n10.  The project differs from ADB\u2019s earlier assistance to CWA by more directly emphasizing \nthe integration of the urban water sector. It leverages CWA\u2019s large operational footprint\u2014its \nextensive  portfolio  of  water  and  wastewater  system  concessions\u2014to  establish  related  and \ncomplementary facilities and provide comprehensive, value-added services.15 Communities in \nsubproject locations are expected to benefit from improved access to water and wastewater \nservices; local governments, meanwhile, are expected to benefit from lower costs for developing \nand operating infrastructure and from more efficient concession management. \n \n3.  The Sponsor and Borrowers \n \n11.  Sponsor. CWA\u2019s core value proposition is optimizing water for cities. In 2003, CWA \nlaunched its operations as one of the first private companies to own and operate water distribution \nnetworks in the PRC. CWA currently has concession operations in 50 cities, across 16 provinces \nand provincial-level municipalities, mostly in smaller cities and towns located in interior regions. \nHaving expanded its geographic footprint, CWA\u2019s strategy is now shifting to better focus on \nexpanding the scope of service offerings to local governments in each location. The company is \norganized around three core business lines: \n \n(i)  Water supply. As of March 2017, CWA operated a total water treatment capacity \nof  6.77  million  m3  per  day  and  managed  126,000  kilometers  (km)  of  water \ndistribution pipelines. Its strategy in municipal water supply is focused on acquiring \n(through either joint ventures with local governments or corporate acquisition) \nunderperforming water supply utilities and improving their operational and financial \nperformance. \n(ii)  Wastewater management. Starting in 2014, and accelerating in 2015\u20132016, the \ncompany has also expanded into the wastewater segment. Through acquisitions \nand newly constructed projects, the company has established a total wastewater \n                                                \n13 The eligibility criteria shall include (i) CWA\u2019s management control;  (ii) location in second- or third-tier municipalities; \n(iii) a concession agreement with service exclusivity and quality standards; (iii) compliance with ADB safeguard \nrequirements; and (iv) minimum thresholds for expected financial return. \n14 The guidelines were reviewed during due diligence and found acceptable to ADB. \n15 CWA seeks to add value through nonrevenue water reduction, improved pressure control, higher water quality, better \nmetering, efficient investment planning, water reuse, and improved environmental management. \n ", "   \n4 \ntreatment capacity of 731,000 m3 per day and manages 3,500 km of sewage \npipelines. \n \n(iii)  Water  construction  services.  CWA  has  developed  capacity  in  water  and \nwastewater construction services; its engineering, procurement, and construction \nsubsidiary  is  officially  qualified  to  undertake  projects  nationally.  Engineering, \nprocurement, and construction services support CWA\u2019s own projects and as well \nas third-party customers. \n \n12.  CWA is incorporated in Bermuda and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. For the \nyear to 30 March 2017, CWA reported consolidated revenues of HK$5.71 billion, net profit of \nHK$1.38 billion, and total assets of HK$25.63 billion. The company\u2019s performance under 6 years \nof ADB assistance has been in line with expectations at the time of ADB approvals, as reflected \nby robust growth, effective management, and achievement of financial ratios well within the \ncovenants of the ADB loan agreements. \n \n13.  Borrowers. The project will have two borrowers: (i) CWA will be the borrower for US \ndollars, and (ii) GT, CWA\u2019s wholly-owned holding company for wastewater treatment and sewage \npipelines, will be the onshore yuan borrower for wastewater treatment and sewage network \nsubprojects.16  \n  \n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n14.  Impact. The impact will be improved access to and efficiency of water supply and \nwastewater management for urban households and other customers in the PRC, consistent with \nthe goals of the PRC\u2019s State Council (footnote 5). \n \n15.  Outcome. The outcome will be the improved delivery and management of water and \nwastewater services in second- and third-tier cities. \n \n16.  Outputs. The outputs will be the (i) construction of water supply and wastewater treatment \nplants (WWTPs) and associated engineering works, and (ii) generation of local employment. By \n2021, subprojects will be developed with the capacity to supply 10.0 million m3 per day of tap \nwater and to treat 1.8 million m3 per day of wastewater and will involve the construction and \noperation of 5,100 km of CWA-managed sewage pipeline networks. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n17.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and the environment as two of ADB\u2019s four \nstrategic priorities.17 With regard to infrastructure, the project is aligned with the strategy\u2019s focus \non water, sanitation, and waste management, as well as its emphasis on PPPs. With regard to \nthe  environment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats  and  promotes \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \n                                                \n16 GT holds CWA\u2019s fleet of 19 wastewater treatment plants with capacity of 730,000 m3 per day. In the year ending 31 \nDecember 2016, GT\u2019s consolidated revenues were CNY764.5 million, for which it earned net profits of CNY188.6 \nmillion. Year-end consolidated total assets were CNY1.85 billion. Further details on GT are provided in Client \nInformation (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. ", "  5 \n \n18.  Consistency with the country strategy. By supporting the development of  PPPs, \nenvironmental management, and inclusive growth, the project addresses three of the five strategic \npriorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC: (i) managing climate change and the \nenvironment (in the area of environmental sustainability and pollution control), (ii) supporting \ninclusive economic growth (in the area of inclusive and green cities\u2019 development), and (iii) \nsupporting institutional and governance reform (in the area of PPP support and private sector \ndevelopment).18 The project complements ADB\u2019s sovereign initiatives to develop the PRC\u2019s water \nsystems, an area of sustained focus for country operations, including notable contributions to \nenable the environment for PPPs.19 \n \n19.  Consistency with the water sector strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s water policy, \nwhich emphasizes the improvement and expansion of water services.20 ADB\u2019s Water Operational \nPlan, 2011\u20132020 also prioritizes the mainstreaming of efficiencies in water project design, \nexpanding ADB\u2019s investments in wastewater management and reuse, and stimulating private \nsector participation.21 The project is an example of the type of intervention envisaged by the plan, \nwhich promotes water as a core investment area and sets ADB\u2019s water investment target at $2.0 \nbillion\u2013$2.5 billion each year by 2020, with an additional $500 million per year targeted in private \nsector lending. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nD.

Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.22 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  For each ADB-funded subproject, CWA will enter into a concession \nagreement with the local government. Each subproject will be implemented \nin accordance with granted approvals and, during construction and operation, \nbe subject to government inspections for various aspects, including \nenvironment, land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, ethnic minorities, \nlabor, safety, quality, and sanitation. The borrowers and each subproject will \nbe required to comply with relevant ADB policies. \nManagement  CWA will centralize subproject development, procurement, and financing \narrangements across its operations. CWA will establish project companies \nfor each subproject. \nImplementation period  2018\u20132021 \n(construction) \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2016.

Each subproject \narrangements  company will enter into separate engineering, procurement, and construction \ncontracts with subcontractors or with construction affiliates within CWA. \nVarious construction components, primarily civil works, equipment \nprocurement, and installation will be outsourced to subcontractors. Goods \nand services will be procured from ADB member countries in a transparent \nmanner through competitive bidding. \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  Under build-operate-transfer and transfer-own-transfer, CWA will charge \nwater or wastewater tariffs based on the volume of service delivered; in the \ncase of wastewater treatment, fees may be subject to a minimum volume of \nofftake guaranteed by the host government.  \nMajor cost structure  Major operational costs include electricity, materials, labor, and \nadministrative and maintenance expenses. \nOperation and  Operation and maintenance will generally be handled by each subproject \nmaintenance  company\u2019s staff, either transferred from CWA or recruited externally. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators and \ncompliance with ADB safeguards, will be reported by CWA and monitored by \nADB throughout the project life. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CWA = China Water Affairs Group Limited, DBFO = design-build-finance-operate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to the borrowers consists of loans of up to $200 million \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22.  During the life of the loans, the borrowers and their subproject companies will be bound \nby  financial  and  operational  covenants  stipulated  in  the  loan  agreement,  including  regular \nmonitoring reports on finances, operations, and development effectiveness, and requirements to \nmeet minimum financial ratios typical for this type of transaction. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  ADB will add value to the project through the following: \n \n(i)  Integrated urban water management is a relatively new business model in the \nPRC\u2019s water sector, and is not yet well understood by sponsors, financiers, and \nlocal governments. ADB\u2019s involvement in the project will help raise the profile of \nintegrated urban water management approaches, and thus catalyze their adoption \nin the PRC.  \n \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s assistance is structured to lower transaction costs by bundling together \nmultiple infrastructure subprojects, which are often too small and time-consuming \nfor local or international commercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. \n ", "  7 \n(iii)  ADB's safeguard policies will require CWA to upgrade its environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to cover the whole water value chain, demonstrating \ninternational best practices for the sector. \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n24.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for the environment and involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous \npeoples. An external third party undertook a corporate audit in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) requirements and found CWA operations compliant with its corporate \nESMS.23 CWA is an existing ADB client and has complied with ADB environmental and social \nrequirements  since  2011  across  two  previous  loans  for  water  treatment  and  distribution \nsubprojects. The institutional capacity and commitment of CWA to manage the project\u2019s social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n25.  The addition of WWTPs to the CWA portfolio and the expansion of the water supply \nbusiness line are anticipated to have environmental impacts during civil construction works, which \nmay include generation of dust, air emission, noise, wastes, soil erosion, and water pollution. \nThese are, however, expected to be short term and localized. The anticipated key environmental \nimpacts during operation include noise elevation due to plant operations, water quality impacts \ndue to poor effluent quality, odor and health risk due to poor sludge management, and safety \nrisks. Initial environmental examination reports will be prepared for subprojects under the new \nloan, and measures to address the environmental impacts associated with construction and \noperation  will  be  covered  under  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  audit  found \nnonsignificant involuntary resettlement impacts managed by the government on past WWTPs \nnow in CWA\u2019s portfolio. No outstanding land acquisition-related issues with material effects were \nidentified in CWA\u2019s portfolio. The borrowers and their subsidiaries will be required to follow ESMS \nprocedures to ensure future land acquisition undertaken by the government for ADB-funded \nsubprojects  is  completed  following  national  requirements  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The audit also found that CWA subprojects are in areas where there \nare typically no distinct or vulnerable ethnic minority groups that could be adversely or beneficially \naffected. Future subprojects are similarly not expected to have impacts on ethnic minority groups. \nHowever, all ADB-funded subprojects will be screened for potential impacts following ESMS \nprocedures. The borrowers will also manage the subproject impacts and risks by following the \nenhanced ESMS that lists practices and procedures. The borrowers will also include, in the \nenhanced ESMS, safeguards screening procedures to avoid subprojects with potential to be \ncategory A for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people; provision on \nearly involvement of ADB in the project identification stage to verify the categorization and \nexclusion from ADB financing; and expansion of the annual reporting coverage to include WWTP \nsubprojects. The ESMS will be enhanced prior to the first disbursement.24 \n \n                                                \n23 The corporate and subprojects audit was undertaken by a qualified and experienced external expert. \n24 Findings  of  the  Corporate  Safeguards  Audit:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "   \n8 \n26.  The borrowers will be required to comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), to take measures to comply with internationally recognized \ncore labor standards including gender equality.25 CWA will report annually to ADB on its (and its \ncontractors\u2019) compliance with such laws and the measures taken.
