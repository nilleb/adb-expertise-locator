INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strategy 2020 calls for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support member countries in \nadapting  to  climate  change.1 ADB\u2019s  Nepal  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132012  includes \nclimate change adaptation and environmental sustainability as one of four strategic pillars.2 It cites \nthe Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR),3 which is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2011\u20132013. The SPCR comprises five components: (i) building climate-resilient \nwatersheds in mountainous ecoregions (administered by ADB), (ii) building resilience to climate-\nrelated  hazards  (administered  by  the  World  Bank),  (iii)  implementing  the  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA), (iv) building climate-resilient communities (through private sector participation \nadministered by the International Finance Corporation), and (v) enhancing climate resilience of \nendangered species (administered by the World Bank). \n \n2.  The TA will build on the work of the ongoing TA, Strengthening Capacity for Managing \nClimate Change and the Environment (to be completed by January 2012).4 The proposed TA \nbuilds upon and enhances ADB\u2019s and the government\u2019s ongoing climate change program in Nepal, \nwhich focuses on institutional strengthening and capacity building, improved information about the \nimpact of climate change on Nepal, and tools for adaptation planning. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  As part of the SPCR planning and preparation process, the capacity of stakeholders to \nadapt to climate change was assessed.6 Capacity gaps and needs were identified within vulnerable \ncommunities and households, vulnerable sectors (e.g., water, forestry, health, agriculture), and key \nagencies and organizations (public, local government and municipalities, and civil society). The \nassessment  used  four  climate  change  risk  management  indicators:  \n(i) knowledge; (ii) mechanisms; (iii) access to resources and ability to deploy such resources; and \n(iv) impediments to assess national, district, and community adaptive capacity. \n \n4.  Two sector, district, and community issues were identified. The first relates to inadequate \nknowledge  of  potential  climate  change  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  social  systems,  and  of \nstrategic  and  systemic  mitigation  and  adaptation  measures  to  address  these.  As  a  result, \ndevelopment  projects  cannot  be  planned  with  new  and  necessary  considerations  for  design \nfeatures and materials to respond to climate change scenarios. Senior officials in some ministries \nand departments have moderate knowledge of climate change risk, but very little knowledge exists \nat junior levels in key government district and local agencies. Most public officials are unfamiliar \nwith tools, such as climate proofing, and screening. Technical training for local government officials, \nparticularly in the districts, and financial resources to implement climate change risk management \nmeasures are needed. \n  \n5.  The  second  issue  relates  to  overlapping  mandates  of  district  agencies,  inadequate \ncoordination, meager fund flows, and weak resource allocation mechanisms, which are major \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n3  Nepal was chosen as one of nine countries to participate in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the \nStrategic Climate Fund of the Climate Investment Funds. The objective of the PPCR is to pilot and demonstrate ways \nto integrate climate risk and resilience into developing countries\u2019 core development planning. SPCR is a government-\nled program describing the TA and investment program using PPCR resources. \n4  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 August 2011. \n6  The methodology and analysis for the adaptive capacity assessment is available at http://www.ppcrnepal.gov.np \n ", "2 \nimpediments to effective climate-change risk management. Existing policies and legal frameworks \nneed to  be  strengthened to  address climate  change risks. Government,  nongovernment,  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  lack  adequate  training  and  financial  resources  to  implement \nclimate change risk management and disaster risk reduction measures.  \n \n6.  National issues include (i) almost complete absence of climate change risk management \npersonnel  in  key  organizations  and  institutions;  (ii)  climate  change  risk  management  is  not \ninstitutionalized in government, academia, civil society, vulnerable sectors, municipalities, districts, \nor  communities;  (iii)  no  training,  database,  information,  or  guidance  exists  for  planning  or \nconstructing climate-resilient development; (iv) financial resources to effectively integrate climate \nchange  risk  management  into  development  planning  are  inadequate;  and  \n(v) development planning in key sectors (water, agriculture, physical planning) does not consider \nthe  risks  associated  with  climate  change  and  no  modalities  are  in  place  to  facilitate  such \ntransformational change in development planning. \n \n7.  With recent support from the United Nations, bilateral agencies, and ADB (footnote 4), \nNepal has completed or has ongoing activities in (i) sensitizing and building national and local \nawareness of climate change impacts and risks and within vulnerable sectors and population \ngroups; (ii) building climate monitoring and analytical capacity, including climate modeling and \nclimate data and records; (iii) building national and local adaptation planning capacity and within \nvulnerable sectors and vulnerable population groups; (iv) developing vulnerability and adaptation \nassessment and planning tools; and (v) preparing and implementing the Climate Change Policy \n(2011) and National Adaptation Programme of Action (2010). The Ministry of Environment (MOE) \nis developing projects to implement the most urgent and immediate adaptation actions in climate-\nvulnerable districts. As a part of institutional strengthening, MOE has started preliminary works for \nestablishing a climate change center and fund. In addition, MOE is preparing a climate change \nstrategy to operationalize the Climate Change Policy, which focuses on climate adaptation and \nresilience7. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The expected impact is that Nepal has increased resilience to climate variability and climate \nchange. The expected outcome is that the government\u2019s infrastructure development programs, \npolicies, and projects incorporate safeguards to address the effects of climate change. By TA end, \nit is expected that (i) risk screening tools and methods are applied for projects in irrigation, flood \nprotection, roads, water supply and sanitation, and urban development; (ii) 50% of approved \nprojects are assessed for climate change risk; and (iii) a trained focal point is in charge of climate \nchange risk management in government infrastructure agencies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Climate change risks are integrated into Nepal\u2019s development planning and \nimplementation of development projects. The National Adaptation Programme of Action and \nClimate Change Policy highlight the need to develop targeted tools to incorporate climate change \nrisk  management  throughout  development  planning  and  implementation.  Line  ministries \nincreasingly understand that changes in climate patterns are impacting their sectors, but have little \nknowledge on how to address these concretely. The TA will focus on infrastructure\u2014irrigation, \n                                                \n7  See Synergies with Other Related Programs (Supplementary Appendix D) for a summary of current capacity-building \ninitiatives in climate change adaptation and climate change risk management (available upon request). \n ", "3 \nflood  protection,  roads,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  urban  development.  Tools  will  be \ndeveloped based on an iterative learning process, and reflect experiences and realities. This will \nensure that institutional capacity is developed as part of the process of tool development, and that \nthe tools are implementable in the context in which they are regularly applied.  At the end of the \nactivities,  MOE  will  facilitate  the  incorporation  of  lessons  and  knowledge  into  an  overall  risk \nmanagement  system.  Climate  proofing  will  take  place  by  (i)  integrating  climate  change  risk \nmanagement into technical guidelines, (ii) developing an overarching risk management system, (iii) \napplying risk identification screening to development projects, and (iv) making recommendations \nfor sector policy revisions, as appropriate.  \n \n10.  The planned activities8 will (i) support implementation of the Climate Change Policy with \nemphasis on policy initiatives that explicitly benefit women, marginalized, and other vulnerable \ngroups; (ii) develop and document sector-specific knowledge and case analysis; (iii) incorporate \nclimate change risk management into sector guidelines, manuals, and standards; (iv) train and \nshare knowledge on climate change risk management; (v) review sector policies; (vi) develop data \nsupport infrastructure for implementing climate change risk management; (vii) prepare detailed \nconcept notes for climate change-related projects, with emphasis on projects that directly improve \nthe climate resilience of women, children, and marginalized groups in rural and urban areas; and \n(viii)  establish  an  overall  climate  change  risk  management  system.  TA  performance  will  be \nmeasured by whether development projects approved by the participating infrastructure agencies \napply the revised guidelines.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Knowledge  management  tools  for  climate  change  are  developed  and \napplied.  The  development  of  knowledge  systems  for  climate  change  and  environmental \nmanagement  was  envisaged  under  the  National  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action,  but \nimplementation  is  in  its  early  stages  and  requires  capacity  building.  Knowledge  sharing  is \nimproving with new government online portals dedicated to climate change news, but fundamental \nsystems  of  creating  new  knowledge  and  supplemental systems for  sharing  new  and  existing \nknowledge would significantly strengthen the country\u2019s knowledge base. By the end of the TA, key \nknowledge partners should have a deeper knowledge of climate change, adaptation, and resilience \nin Nepal; be able to store and retrieve the information that such knowledge is based on; and \ncommunicate this knowledge more regularly and clearly. Specifically, MOE should be regularly and \nclearly communicating the newly acquired knowledge, key results, and lessons identified during TA \nimplementation. \n \n12.  The knowledge system will use a holistic cycle of creating, storing, and sharing knowledge. \nThe activities,9 organized according to these categories, will (i) implement a district climate change \ntraining  program,  including  community-based  vulnerability  assessment,  risk  assessment,  and \nadaptation  planning,  with  specific  measures  to  assure  an  adequate  proportion  of  female \nparticipants  and  representatives  of  marginalized  communities  in  the  training;  \n(ii) update educational curriculum on climate science and resilience; (iii) provide a small research \ngrant fund for Nepal researchers;10 (iv) document traditional or indigenous adaptation practices in \nNepal,  including  those  of  women  and  disadvantaged  groups;  (v)  establish  and  manage  a \nknowledge management system on climate change; (vi) prepare and implement a communication \nstrategy for Nepal\u2019s climate change program, including capacity building of MOE\u2019s communication \nofficers; and (vii) produce knowledge products and provide knowledge support.

MOE will ensure that the human resources (government counterpart staff, consultants, and \nservice providers) and the design and implementation of all output 2 activities (training, research, \nknowledge production and products, and communications) are gender and socially inclusive (for \ndisadvantaged and marginalized groups).  \n \n14.  Output 3: Outputs and lessons from the SPCR and other adaptation programs are \nmanaged for results and incorporated into Nepal\u2019s climate change programming. MOE will \nestablish a results management function for its climate change adaptation program. It will guide the \npreparation and refinement of a climate change program results framework including monitoring \ntargets and indicators (and associated baselines) that will enable MOE to measure the extent that \npeople  in  Nepal  are  able  to  adapt  to  climate  change  and  the  extent  to  which  government \ndevelopment programs, policies, and projects incorporate climate change impacts. Each agency \ninvolved in leading or implementing SPCR components and other adaptation programs and the \nrespective development partners will actively participate in preparing the climate change program \nresults framework (CCPRF). Framework preparation will be guided by the results framework of the \nPilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) and Nepal\u2019s experience in managing for development \nresults (coordinated by the National Planning Commission). A management information system will \nbe established to implement the monitoring and coordination of all progress indicators in line with \nthe CCPRF. \n \n15.  MOE\u2019s Climate Change Management Division will set up quarterly meetings with each \nproject director to discuss key issues affecting progress and share implementation experience and \nfeedback  related  to  meeting  specific  project  targets  and  expected  outputs.  Data  for  specific \nindicators will be collected and reported annually along with any baseline data surveys needed \nduring detailed project design or at the beginning of project implementation. Any deviation from \ntargets and achieved results will be dealt with in a timely manner to allow for corrective actions at \nthe  early  stages  of  implementation.  Evaluation  activities  such  as field  visits,  and  review  and \nanalysis of progress reports will collect data to assess project progress. \n \n16.  MOE will lead annual program reviews based on the CCPRF, supported by the TA. Each \nproject director and responsible development partner will participate in the program review. At each \nreview, the CCPRF will be assessed and amended as necessary. MOE will produce and make \npublic a program evaluation following each review.11  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is $7.163 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Strategic Climate Fund, and administered by ADB.12 The government will contribute \nin-kind by covering the participation of government personnel in TA activities, and office space \n(with electricity, internet, and telephone) for the consultants. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                \n11  More detailed procedures for this output are in Results Management and Climate Change Adaptation Program \nCoordination (Output 3) Implementation Note (Supplementary Appendix C) (available upon request.)  \n12 Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Expected  TA  implementation  milestones  are  (i)  effectiveness,  February  2012,  \n(ii) consultant mobilization, June 2012, (iii) completion of TA activities, January 2017, and (iv) TA \nfinancial closure, July 2017. MOE will be the executing agency. The MOE secretary will chair a TA \nsteering committee comprising senior representatives of the Department of Water Supply and \nSewerage,  the  Department  of  Roads,  the  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Building \nConstruction, the Department of Irrigation, the Department of Water-Induced Disaster Prevention, \nthe Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, the Ministry of Local Development, the Department \nof Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads, and the Ministry of Education\u2014they \nare all directly involved in TA implementation. The Nepal Climate Change Knowledge Management \nCentre under the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology will implement some knowledge \nmanagement activities. MOE will establish advisory boards to guide the development of a small \ngrant research fund and upgrading of educational curricula. Nongovernment and community-based \norganizations  will  be  involved  in  TA  implementation  as  service  providers  for  knowledge \nmanagement, documentation of best practices, communication, and training. \n \n19.  A fiduciary risk assessment, conducted in August 2011 as part of ADB\u2019s due diligence, \nevaluated  MOE  practices  in  implementing  the  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Managing  Climate \nChange and the Environment TA (footnote 4) and recommended ways to build MOE capacity in \nprocurement and financial management. The risk assessment and risk management plan is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n20.  MOE\u2019s  Climate  Change  Management  Division  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  TA \nimplementation. MOE will designate the national project director (joint-secretary) and two national \nproject managers (undersecretaries). MOE will depute an accountant to serve as the full-time TA \naccountant.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n21.  A firm (or consortium of firms) specializing in climate risk management will provide the main \nconsulting  services  (85  person-months  of  international  and  252  person-months  of  national \nconsultants over 5 years). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. ADB \nwill engage the main consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method (with 80:20 \nquality-cost  weighting).  Various  service  providers  will  be  needed  to  help  MOE  manage  such \nactivities  as  the  district  training  program,  research,  curriculum  development,  and  web  portal \nmanagement. ADB will engage all consultants and service providers in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  ADB will finance equipment for the TA activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment will become the property of the \ngovernment upon TA completion. MOE will procure the equipment. ADB will recruit (under the main \nconsulting  firm  package)  a  national  procurement  specialist  to  assist  MOE  in  selecting  and \ncontracting service providers, and procuring goods. \n \nIV.

Background \n1.  Nepal is a country that is highly vulnerable to climate change, and the Government has \nsought to strengthen its capacity to manage climate change risks, for example, through the \ndevelopment of its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and Climate Change \nPolicy. These exercises highlighted the need to develop targeted tools to incorporate climate \nchange risk management throughout its development planning and implementation.  Each of the \nline Ministries in Nepal has an increasing understanding that changes in climate patterns are \nimpacting their sectors, but little is known on how to address these concretely. \n2.  Output 1 of the proposed TA is \u201cclimate change risk management is integrated into \nNepal\u2019s development planning and implementation of development projects.\u201d  As the subject is \nquite broad, the TA places an emphasis on infrastructure sectors at the national level. Sectors \nwhich will be covered under this output include irrigation, flood protection, roads, water supply \nand  sanitation,  and  urban  development 1.  The  activities  described  below  are  based  on \nconsultations with respective ministries and departments on their needs and particular capacity \nconstraints. Tools  will  be  developed  based  on  an  iterative  learning  process  and to  reflect \nexperiences and realities on the ground. This will ensure that institutional capacity is developed \nas part of the process of tool development, and that those tools are implementable in the \ncontext in which they are regularly applied.  At the end of the activities, MOE will facilitate rolling \nup lessons learned and knowledge into an overall risk management system. \u201cClimate proofing\u201d \nwill take place at four levels: by integrating climate change risk management into technical \nguidelines,  by  developing  an  overarching  risk  management  system,  by  applying  risk \nidentification screening to development projects, and by making recommendations for sector \npolicy revisions, as appropriate. \n3.  While the output has been tailored to respond to the needs of specific Government \nagencies, some cross cutting themes have emerged across sectors. These are: (i) the need for \nmore comprehensive data and climate change projections as input into design processes, (ii) \nthe preference for learning from doing, (iii) adjustments to guidelines which are based on \nexperience, and (iv) trainings which are highly targeted, scientific as well as conceptual, at the \nnational  as  well  as  district  level.    In  addition,  there  is  little  experience  in  cross-sectoral, \necosystem wide or systems based planning and implementation, which is often needed to \naddress  climate  change  risks  in  a  sustainable  and  cost  effective  way.  Also,  capacity  for \nimplementation of tools and new knowledge must exist at several levels of planning, from \nnational  to  local.  Project  concept  notes  developed  through  this  output  should  assist  the \nGovernment in addressing some of these challenges and in applying and testing tools and \nknowledge developed through this TA. \n                                                \n1 Sand mining is also included. The hydropower sector is not included as it is is addressed through SPCR \nComponent 4. ", "2  Supplementary Appendix A \n \nB.  The Output \n4.  Output 1 is that Climate change risk management is integrated into Nepal\u2019s development \nplanning and implementation of development projects.  The eight activities areas outlined below \nwill involve generating and applying tools and knowledge to incorporate climate change risk \nmanagement into development planning and implementation. \n5.  The key performance indicators will be that sector and national planning tools reflect \nclimate change risks management and that infrastructure projects approved after the planning \ntools are in place demonstrate that the new tools have been applied.  \nC.  Activities \n6.  A  number  of  planning  tools  developed  in  the  past  have  not  been  effective  or \nimplemented. Often, these have been project driven, unrealistic in a given local context, pose \nadditional administrative burden and are under-resourced for implementation. The proposed TA \nwill support sector agencies to develop knowledge and experience so that they can integrate \nclimate change risk management into sector-specific design guidelines, manuals and standards. \nAs necessary, recommendations for revisions to sector policies will also be made through TA \nsupport.  \n7.  While Output 2 will expand training for community based vulnerability assessment, this \noutput  will  complement  that  knowledge  by  responding  to  vulnerabilities  through  improved \ndevelopment planning.  Both of these \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches are needed, \nespecially in light of the uncertainties related to science based climate change projections and \nthe fast evolving nature of impacts at the community level. Grounding adaptation measures in \nan understanding of actual current vulnerabilities ensures their appropriateness in addressing \nthe country\u2019s overarching objectives for poverty reduction. \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A  3 \n1.  Activity 1.1 Implementation of Nepal\u2019s Climate Change Policy \n8.  Nepal\u2019s 2011 Climate Change Policy calls for certain strategies, studies, and action \nplans to be developed and implemented to make development initiatives climate-friendly and \nresilient. The Government  has  initiated the  development  of  a  Climate  Change  Strategy  to \nimplement the policy. The TA will provide supplementary support to the implementation of the \npolicy and strategy, as necessary. Policy initiatives that explicitly benefit women, marginalized, \nand other vulnerable groups will be emphasized. It will also help to build awareness among \nNepal stakeholders of the policy and strategy through knowledge management activities (see \nOutput 2). \n2.  Activity 1.2 Develop and document sector-specific knowledge and case \nanalysis. \n9.  In order to generate a greater understanding of how climate change risk management \ncan be implemented through development activities, a set of climate change risk cases will be \nanalyzed and developed by each infrastructure department.  In each sector, experts have \nidentified areas of concern regarding premature failures of given projects and programs due to \nunexpected variability in climate, particularly in water availability, quantity and intensity of rainfall. \nPractitioners expressed a desire to understand the reasons for these project challenges as a \nbasis for understanding how to improve their planning processes, including prioritization of \ndevelopment projects, spatial planning and engineering design. This approach is extremely \nuseful in ensuring the adjustments to engineering guidelines is institutionalized rather than \nsimply documented. Interest in climate change risk management will be increased because it \nwill draw from on the ground experiences.  Any adjustments to guidelines proposed will be \ninformed by actual challenges faced in each sector.  Also, lessons from academic researches \nconducted  through  the  Small  Grants  Research  Fund  (Activity  2.3),  documentation  of  local \nknowledge and adaptation practices (Activity 2.4), findings from research supported by NAPA \nand other previous studies will be used. The case analysis should consider end-user needs and \npreferences for any climate change risk management measure. \n10.  In the case of water supply and sewerage, experts are seeking a better understanding of \nthe challenges, identification of hot-spots and options available to reduce vulnerability, before \nproposing  adjustments  to  engineering  manuals.  The  Department  of  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage (DWSS) identified a concern over declining water yield in previously reliable sources, \nparticularly during the dry season. Out of forty drinking water sources observed in Makwanpur \nDistrict, five have completely dried and 20 are declining. An examination of technology options \nfor increasing water recharge and retention during the rainy season, technology options for \nsanitation in water stressed areas including knowledge and technologies for \u2018demand- side-\nmanagement\u2019 is needed. A further concern is related to unreliable power supply to pumping \nsystems as a result of uneven hydropower generation. Though not directly part of the TA, the \nissue is noted as climate change may be impacting on hydro-power generation in the country. \nAlso, DWSS would like to gain experience in applying climate change projections and scenarios, \nto see how that information would affect current priorities and planning in both the rural and \nurban settings. Through this TA, DWSS will undertake an assessment to identify \u2018hot-spots\u2019 \nwhere the portfolio of existing and planned projects may be more vulnerable to climate change \nimpacts. Potential case studies can be developed in Bandipur, Bardiwas, Makwanpur and in \nRamechhap, and a couple of additional locations/districts representing various scenarios and \necological situations.  DWSS will analyse the design and decision-making processes used in \ndeveloping water supply and sanitation systems which are currently failing, and identify how \nclimate change may be impacting those systems, and, how the design process could have been ", "4  Supplementary Appendix A \nimproved for better climate change risk management. This will be documented and use as a \nbasis for revising associated guidelines, as well as serve as a training exercise for engineers \nand planners.  \n11.  Along similar lines, the Department of Irrigation (DOI) cited a number of cases of \nirrigation projects which are challenged due to unreliable water availability. They need a better \nunderstanding of how to address the uncertainties related to climate change projections in the \ncontext  of  engineering  design  and  planning  processes.   This  means  understanding  how \nchanges in rainfall patterns are and will affect the local hydrology and requires both improved \ndata  and  modeling.   Using  climate  change  projections  means  assessing  how  relevant \nparameters, such as maximum rainfall, are and will change in the future. Engineering designs \nshould  seek  to  accommodate  these  changes  to  ensure  that  they  are  adequately \ndesigned.  Through this activity, DOI will undertake the same activities as those described in the \npreceding paragraph, including detailed identification of hot-spots and case analysis to review \nthe design and decision making process improvements which could be made. \n12.  In terms of urban planning, the Department of Urban Development and Building \nConstruction (DUDBC) will review the vulnerability of the urban infrastructure, focusing on \ndrainage requirements as a case example of where and why urban centres are vulnerable, and \nagree on how its urban planning guidelines need to be updated as a result. Further, DUDBC will \nundertake case analysis to identify improvements to the decision and design process related to \ndrainage, rainwater harvesting, water retention and groundwater recharge along water bodies. \nThis will serve to inform revisions of the building by-laws in light of climate change. UN-Habitat \nis also in the process of developing a vulnerability assessment of Kathmandu City, and this will \nbe useful to identify areas and infrastructure that is vulnerable to climate variability and change. \nFurther,  DUDBC  will  also  undertake  a  case  analysis  related  to  improved  planning  and \ntechniques for the above noted issues, also with the objective of informing an addendum to their \nrainwater harvesting handbook.  \n13.  For district-level planning and development, the Department of Local Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) identified concerns over the vulnerability of \nrural roads, water supply and small-scale irrigation projects. Unpaved rural roads are often more \nvulnerable to intense rainfall events because they are unpaved and therefore more easily \nerodible. In addition, roads are often cited as being the cause of increased vulnerability, as they \ncan increase the incidence of land-slides and erosion in fragile mountain systems. The impacts \nto local infrastructure have become more apparent with deepening droughts and more intense \nrainfall events.  DOLIDAR engineers will participate in a focused learning activity to review \ntransportation options, alignment and design or rural roads, and determine how its engineering \nguidelines should be adjusted. DOLIDAR will do the same for small-scale water supply and \nirrigation. \n14.  The Department of Roads (DOR) also faces increasing problems relating to damage to \nroads, bridges and drainage systems as a result of land-slides, intense rainfall events, rapid \nsediment deposition and an increase in the frequency of historically low return period floods. \nAlso,  the  alignment  and  construction  of  roads  in  some  fragile  areas  are  exacerbating \nvulnerability, particularly in fragile mountain systems, to increased erosion, landslides and flash \nfloods. Some roads have increased flood vulnerability, while others have been routed over \ngroundwater recharge areas/spring sources, potentially reducing the water supply because of \nlower infiltration of rainwater during the rainy season and in the drying of spring sources.  The \nDOR will undertake a vulnerability analysis of its existing road network and analyze in detail the \ndecision, planning and design methods which were used for a particularly vulnerable road ", "Supplementary Appendix A  5 \nsegment and bridge.  This information will also be used for training and to inform the revision of \nguidelines. \n15.  The  Department  of  Water  Induced  Disaster  Prevention  (DWIDP)  implements  a \nnumber  of  activities  including  the  preparation  of  hazard  maps,  conducting  community \nawareness programs & trainings, and management of transboundary rivers including inundation \nand flood management.  These activities are important to protect infrastructure from damage \ndue to flooding events greater coordination is needed between DWIDP and other Government \nagencies. DWIDP will review its hazard maps under this activity in order to update it to include \nclimate change vulnerability. This will also provide useful information for other Government \nagencies. They will also undertake a review of flood control measures in place to identify how \nthey  can  be  targeted  to  protect  key  vulnerable  infrastructure  identified  by  other  project \nstakeholders, such as the types and placement of embankments to protect communities against \nfloods. Flood management measures may then subsequently be incorporated into draft concept \npapers described below in activity 1.6. Further, during the period January 2011 to December \n2011, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (through ADB financing under TA 7173) will \ndownscale global and regional models and prepare impact scenarios for a 12- to 25-km grid in \nNepal. This will provide improved information on how climate patterns have and may change \nand will be useful in updating the assumed water availability and flood risks for each sectors and \nwill be incorporated by DWIDP into its hazard mapping.  Coordination with other experts hired \nunder Component 1 of the SPCR will be required to draw in expertise related to water-source \nconservation and environmental measures, a need expressed by DWIDP. \n16.  The Government is in the process of preparing a comprehensive guideline for river bed \nsand  mining2.  Current  practice  of  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (IEE)  for  awarding \naggregate mining does not consider river and sediment flows in the context of climate change, \nis  based  on  district  boundaries,  lacks  proper  monitoring  system  and  DDCs  do  not  have \nadequate capacity to enforce regulations. The rampant mining of river beds have exacerbated \nflood impacts in numerous communities and have increased the vulnerability of roads, bridges, \nirrigation structures and agriculture lands. The Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Local \nDevelopment will revisit the ongoing process of preparing the sand mining guideline based on \nclimate science \u2013 using downscaled global and regional models, global practices on sustainable \nharvesting, managing river aggradations from a river process and restoration perspective. The \nMOE and MOLD staff will participate in preparing the guideline, in identify hot-spots undergoing \nriver degradation that impact lives, livelihoods and structures and in training for monitoring \nprocesses.  \n3.  Activity  1.3  Incorporate  climate  change  risk  management  into  sector \nguidelines, manuals and standards. \n17.  Based on a greater understanding developed through Activity 1.2 of climate change risks \nin the given sectors, a review of existing planning manuals and guidelines will be undertaken \nand revisions made by each Government department.  Current engineering guidelines, for \nexample,  propose  designs  based  on  historical  climate  patterns  which  have  changed.  The \ndesigns are therefore inadequate in the current climate averages, such as annual average \nrainfall, which does not take into account the variability of rainfall and the peak events. A greater \nchallenge is in designing based on future climate projections, which can carry a high degree of \nuncertainty and possibly unnecessary costs. A methodology for guiding decision making in light \nof these risks will be developed as part of Activity 1.7, described below.  \n                                                \n2 Also includes aggregate, gravels and boulders ", "6  Supplementary Appendix A \n18.  Government  agencies  have  identified  a  number  of  guidelines  which  would  be \nappropriate for updating based on climate change risk management. DWSS uses a set of \ntwelve volumes for designing water supply systems. These were developed in 1992/93 and \nupdated in 2002. DWSS will review and make adjustments to these guidelines to include future \nclimate change risks, including changes to flood and drought return-periods and the impacts of \ninfrastructure  developments  on  the  vulnerability  to  surrounding  areas,  such  as  drought \nexacerbation and erosion.  DOI\u2019s irrigation guidelines include a set of 23 volumes which were \ndeveloped in 1990 and have not been revised since. They will also revise these guidelines in \nlight of knowledge and tools developed by this proposed TA. \n19.  The  MOLD  has  recently  developed  a  local  infrastructure  environment  policy  and \nguidelines in cooperation with MOE.  It is expected that these will be finalized by the end of this \nyear but do not currently include climate change.  MOLD will incorporate climate change risk \nmanagement into the policy and guidelines.  DOLIDAR identified the opportunity to reviewing its \nguidelines for rural road development in the context of climate change risks, which will be done \nunder this TA. In addition, they are currently working with UNICEF to adapt water supply and \nsewerage guidelines for small-scale systems to be used for district level planning process. \nConfirmation is needed on whether climate change is integrated into that process.  \n20.  In summary, the following guidelines or manuals will be revised for climate change for \neach agency: \n\u2022  DWSS will revise a number of its 12 volumes for designing water supply systems.  \n\u2022  DOI\u2019s will revise a number of its 23 volumes  \n\u2022  MOLD will revise its local infrastructure environment policy and guidelines, as well as \nriver bed gravel and sand mining guidelines \n\u2022  DOR will revise its pavement, geometry, drainage and bridge design guidelines \n\u2022  DOLIDAR will revise its water supply and sewerage, rural roads guidelines \n\u2022  DUDBC will revise its drainage, water retention and building code guidelines as well as \nflood plain and land zoning guidelines and rainwater harvesting handbook \n\u2022  DWIDP will revise its hazard mapping and review guidelines related to river training, \nglacial lake outbursts \n4.  Activity 1.4 Train and share knowledge on climate change risk management. \n21.  Utilizing the climate change risk management design guidelines and manuals to be \ndeveloped under the above activities, an intensive training package on climate change risk \nmanagement will be developed by all agencies. Its objective will be to train engineers and \nplanners  of  different  sectors  to  enhance  their  capacity  in  the  field  of  climate  change  risk \nidentification, assessment, analysis, quantification, prioritization, planning (management plan, \nimplementation plan, and rehearsal plan), monitoring and evaluation.  The trainings will be \nOutput oriented, and aim to build institutional capacity for understanding how climate change \nrisks influence decisions and designs in each Ministry. Applied and field based learning will also \nbe encouraged, so that trainees are working on real cases of climate change risks as a method \nof learning. Target groups include Government national and district specialists and the private ", "Supplementary Appendix A  7 \nsector (i.e. national engineering firms). Agency District and Field staff will be trained through five \nregional trainings. District and field staff will also be highly involved in the case analysis. \n22.  Ministries  and  Departments  identified  the  need  to  train  engineers  and  planners  to \nunderstand the basic concepts of climate change, on the science and on the tools, methods and \ntechnologies available. The case analysis in Activity 2.2 for example will serve as a basis for \napplied learning. Target groups will include technical and policy staff at national and district \nlevels and can include site visits.   The levels of existing training programs vary from none to \nextensive and so will vary in terms of effort to establish training programs. Each agency will \ndevelop its targeted training objectives and will work with MOE to develop these programs. \n23.  Some of the cross-cutting topics that may be covered include: the science of climate \nchange, vulnerability, impacts and adaptation, disaster risk management synergies, impacts in \nNepal, interpreting climate projections, and experiences of climate proofing in other countries. \nThe MOE will implement these cross-cutting trainings for other Government agencies, based on \ntheir  identified  needs,  which  will  at  the  same  time  promote  inter-sectoral  exchange  of \ninformation.  At least two of these trainings will be organized.  Sector specific trainings may \ninclude climate change risk management for urban planning, water supply and sanitation, small \nand large-scale irrigation and roads and these will be implemented by respective agencies.  \nMost of the trainings will be in smaller targeted groups, but some larger cross-sectoral seminars \nwill also be used to address cross-cutting issues and to promote inter-Ministerial learning and \ncooperation. Towards the end of the proposed TA, a seminar will be held by MOE to prioritize \nand develop detailed project concepts where multi-sectoral cooperation will be emphasized, as \nwell as an application of the revised guidelines and risk management approaches developed \nunder this TA. \n24.  As stated above, the TA will support the development of new training curriculum in \nclimate change risk management for DWSS, DOI, DUDBC, DOLIDAR, DOR, DWIDP, and \nMOLD. In the interest of sustaining these efforts beyond the TA period, it is expected that the \nnew training materials will be integrated into the regular training programs of those agencies. \n25.  The capacity of the local engineering market (i.e., private sector firms and individual \nconsultants) will also be built under this TA through including them in the above training events \nand/or holding specific trainings and discussions for them.  \n5.  Activity 1.5   Review sector policies. \n26.  Once  activities  1.2,  1.3,  and  1.4  have  been  implemented,  DWSS,  DOI,  DUDBC, \nDOLIDAR, DOR, DWIDP, and MOLD may recognize a need to re-assess their sector policies \nboth in light of Nepal\u2019s Climate Change Policy and the knowledge developed through this TA. \nAs relevant, the same experts working with the agencies named above will assist the agencies \nto review their policies and make recommendations for policy revisions. The TA itself will not \ninitiate any revisions of the sector policies, but will only facilitate the review and documentation \nof recommendations.  \n6.  Activity 1.6  Develop a data support infrastructure for the implementation \nof climate change risk management. \n27.  In order to support the application of revised guidelines and screening tools, Ministries \nand  Departments  have  consistently  identified  data,  its  quality  and  sector  specific  hydro-\nmeteorological  products  (such  as  info  sheets  on  precipitation  for  watersheds/districts, ", "8  Supplementary Appendix A \nhydrological modeling, impact modeling based on downscaled projections for watersheds/cities) \nas a major limiting factor. For instance, the ideal climate parameters for most infrastructure \ndesign would accommodate for variability in water supply or for peak flows. Instead, generalized \nannual precipitation/flow values are used because of the format in which data is currently \navailable.   \n28.  DHM is the repository for all hydrological data.  They collect data in standardized WMO \nformats to ensure international consistency and they provide basic modeling and forecasting \nservices.  One of the key aims of the SPCR Component 2: Building Resilience to Climate-\nRelated Hazards is to develop the capacity and coverage of the Department of Meteorology and \nHydrology (DHM). It will also enhance the collection and maintenance of high quality real time \ndata.  A  protocol  will  be  developed  under  SPCR  Component  2  to  push  these  data to the \nappropriate user agencies who may or may not to specialized forecasting and analysis. A focal \npoint will be identified in DHM to service the data and information needs of DWSS, DOI, \nDUDBC, DOLIDAR, DOR, DWIDP, and MOLD pertaining to this Output 1.  Also, to further \nimprove the utility of meteorological information for sector planning, they will request of and \ndiscuss with each Ministry and Department to identify the format for climate and meteorological \ndata which are required for engineering design processes to be submitted to MOE/DHM.  DHM \nwill  then  undertake  detailed  hydrological  modeling  and  ground-truthing  in  key  watersheds \nagreed. Each department will devise an appropriate system for storing data, information and \nknowledge including the findings from vulnerability assessments. This information will also be \nsubmitted  to  the  Nepal  Climate  Change  Knowledge  Management  Centre  (NCCKMC).  The \nfindings will be made public through the web-portals of MOE, the respective departments and \nNCCKMC. A modeling expert will work with all agencies to scope the further modeling work \nrequired and assist the agencies in using these. \n29.  Some improvements can be made by extending the current detailed climate change \ndownscaling exercise by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (through ADB financing under \nTA 7173) which will also prepare impact scenarios for a 12- to 25-km grid in Nepal. ADPC is \nalso preparing a web-portal for DHM to make the results available which may also be used as a \ncentral repository for data required by agencies to implement their revised guidelines. A central \nrepository  and  capacity  for  further  impact  modeling,  particularly  for  land  movements  (i.e. \nlandslides, sediment deposition, erosion) and hydrology is needed which can provide regular \nand high quality data to agencies for their design and planning purposes.   The DWSS has \nrequested extensive databases, identification of hotspots with vulnerability mapping of impacts \non existing water sources and supply systems. Further, detailed assessments of the impacts on \nwater  supply  service  levels  (small/medium/large  scale,  gravity  fed/pumping  systems, \nunderground/surface/spring sources, mountain/hill/terai areas) under different climate change \nscenario  was  requested.  A  similar  level  of  sector  specific  vulnerability  analysis  could  be \nundertaken for the other sectors.   \n7.  Activity  1.7  Prepare  detailed  concept  notes  for  climate  change  related \nprojects. \n30.  The TA during its period will assist in identifying priority areas and in developing climate \nchange  related  projects  for  the  GON  prioritized  sectors  in  consultation  with  the  relevant \ninstitutions,  development  partners  and  stakeholders.  The  Climate  Change  Program \nCoordination Committee will guide MOE in determining which ideas should be developed into \nconcept notes. Projects that directly improve the climate resilience of women, children, and \nmarginalized groups in both rural and urban areas will be prioritized. MOE will prepare a \nminimum of twenty short concept notes, out of which at least five project proposals will be ", "Supplementary Appendix A  9 \ndeveloped. The level of detail required in the concept notes and project proposals will be \nsuitable for initial consideration by bilateral or multi-lateral donors.  \n8.  Activity 1.8 Establish an overall climate change risk management system. \n31.  The experiences and methods developed through the above activities will be rolled up by \nMOE  into  an  overarching  risk  management  system.  This  will  include  the  development  of \nframework guidelines and climate change risk screening tools3.  MOE will develop an overall \nframework methodology for climate-proofing development planning and projects in order to \nguide the integration of climate change risk management into sector plans, guidelines and tools. \nA number of internationally developed approaches exist, such as risk-based climate change \nassessments,  disaster  risk  management  approaches,  impact  assessment  driven  models, \nvulnerability-based  adaptation  assessments.  Because  the  emphasis  of  the  output  is  on \ninfrastructure planning and design, approaches will need to be borrowed from the fields of \nengineering research and economic cost-benefit analysis. In particular, an agreed approach to \ndata and information needs and to managing risk and uncertainty in climate projections will \nneed to be developed. This will provide some coherence between the approaches developed \nspecific to each sector. \n32.  Further, the MOE in collaboration with relevant agencies will identify a screening tool for \nsectors to use to screen development projects or programs in order to identify potentially risky \nprojects, so that they can be reviewed for appropriateness by Government agencies.  Feedback \nfrom the use of the tool will then be used by MOE to revise it as needed and to develop a set of \nsupport tools and guidelines to reduce the vulnerability of high risk projects. Lessons learned \nwill be drawn from this exercise and will feed into the knowledge development under this TA.  In \naddition, MOE will use the experiences developed through the above activities to amend its \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  guidelines.  These  will  be  tested  through  the  TORs  of \nselected high risk mega-infrastructure projects. \nD.  Human Resources \n33.  The output will be implemented through the respective line Ministries and Departments \nwhile  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment.    The  TA  will  ensure  that  the  capacity  of \nGovernment  staff  are  developed  through  this  TA  and  that  learning  is  supported  through \nconsultants. Consultants will be brought in where the capacity and knowledge does not exist \nwithin the executing and implementing agencies, to facilitate the work which will be undertaken \nby Government staff. A great deal of international knowledge sharing and transfer of technology \nand know-how is needed to this output to be successful, as its goals are ambitious and the \ninternational community of in the process of developing these tools collectively. \n1.  Government human resources contribution. \n34.  The TA requires the following Government human resources for knowledge activities \nand technical support. \n \n                                                \n3 For example the one developed through the National Planning Commission, the Asian Development Bank ", "10  Supplementary Appendix A \na.  At least one senior sector engineer each in DWSS4, DOI, DUDBC, \nDOR, DOLIDAR, MOLD, DWIDP. \n\u2022  Rationale:   The activities above, particularly activities 1.2 and 1.3 requires detailed \nknowledge of the current engineering guidelines, manuals and standards as well as \nthe processes involved in their reviews, revisions, approvals and applications.  The \nGovernment staff should also lead the case analysis and sector specific knowledge \nproducts, guiding the identification of training priorities and drawing lessons learned. \nPermanent focal persons should be identified from each participating agency. \n\u2022  Estimated time required: Six months each over the course of the project. \n\u2022  Summary of TOR: These should be senior engineers who are familiar with the \napplication of their guidelines and manuals. They should also have good knowledge \nof the planning and prioritisation process and have some exposure to climate change \nactivities from previous activities. They would lead the identification of needs and \ngaps,  identify  sources of  information,  lead  the  process  of  review,  revisions  and \napprovals  of  guidelines  and  manuals  and  make  recommendations  for  follow-up \naction. They would contribute to the training sessions, including the preparation of \nmaterials and identification of key staff.  The staff will also lead in the identification of \ndraft concept papers for projects, together with counterparts from other Ministries \nand  Departments.    They  would  also  be  responsible  for  coordinating  with  the \nExecuting Agency throughout the TA and serve as a focal point. \n \nb.  Planning and budgeting officer (1 each for DWSS, DOI, DUDBC, DOR, \nDOLIDAR, MOLD, DWIDP) \n\u2022  Rationale:    The  Government  will  self-screen  the  climate  change  risks  of \ndevelopment priorities and budgets by testing the application of a climate change \nrisk-screening tool. For many agencies, this will take place through District offices \nand therefore they should be included in training programs as well. \n\u2022  Estimated  time  required:  Approximately  two  week  per  year  per  implementing \nagency \n\u2022  Summary TOR: The person should be regularly part of the identification of sector \npriorities  and  budget  proposals.  They  would  be  responsible  for  collecting  and \ndocumenting feedback on the use of the tool and propose changes for improvement. \n \nc.  Training facilitators/coordinators (1 each for DWSS, DOI, DUDBC, \nDOR, DOLIDAR, MOLD, DWIDP) \n\u2022  Rationale: Many of the implementing agencies have regular trainings, either for new \nengineers or as refreshers for regular staff. The training program under this TA \nshould be incorporated into these as much as possible so that they can be more \nsustainable after the end of the project. \n\u2022  Estimated  time  required:  Approximately  one  week  per  year  per  implementing \nagency. For several agencies, there will be training activities at regional and central \nlevels, so the time estimate will be more. \n\u2022  Summary TORs: The person would help to identify training facilitators, assist in the \nlogistics and scheduling arrangements, the development of the schedule and training \nprogram over the course of the TA, including innovative ways of learning. \n                                                \n4 DWSS notes that significant involvement of divisions/subdivision chiefs will be necessary in order to mainstream CC \nconcerns, and plans to dedicate 10-12 months of staff time over the TA implementation period. ", "Supplementary Appendix A  11 \n \nd.  Knowledge and data management (DHM) \n\u2022  Rationale: The development of detailed impact assessments, appropriate to the use \nof each sector, will need to be housed in an existing institution. \n\u2022  Estimated  time  required: Regular throughout the project and likely institutional \nsupport rather than individuals \n\u2022  Summary  TORs: The institution should be mandated to undertake and develop \nknowledge  about  the  country\u2019s  water  resources.

Background \n \n1.  Knowledge systems for climate change and environmental management have been \nconceptualized to some extent by previous projects in the Ministry of Environment (MOE). Their \nimplementation is in its early stages and requires capacity building. Knowledge sharing is \nimproving with new Government online portals dedicated to climate change news in Nepal, but \nfundamental systems of creating new knowledge and supplemental systems for sharing new \nand existing knowledge would significantly strengthen the country\u2019s knowledge base.  \n \n2.  Output 2 of the proposed TA, also referred to as the \u201cknowledge and communications \noutput\u201d or the \u201cIEC output\u201d for its information-education- communication scope, is built on the \nNepal\u2019s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA plus) findings and the outputs from \nthe Strengthening Capacity to Manage Climate Change and the Environment (hereafter called \nTA 7173) and has been designed based on discussions during multi-stakeholder workshops \nand subsequent Government feedback. In design workshops for this TA, university participants \nspoke about a lack of resources for essential climate and environmental research. Research \ninstitutes spoke about a lack of a system to collect, manage and make information from the \nmany  sources  (many  of  them  foreign)  accessible  and  meaningful  for  Nepal.  National \nrepresentatives  repeatedly  characterized  local  Governments  as  eager  to  learn  and  govern \nbetter, but needed training and tools to guide them. This Output 2 attempts to address some of \nthese needs.  \n \n3.  Output 2 is also based on the findings from the district and community training program \ndevelopment  under  TA  7173,  the  National  Planning  Commission\u2019s  work  on  preparing  the \nClimate Resilient Planning \u2013 a tool for long term climate adaptation (supported by ADB) and \nthrough ongoing work supported by DfID in the preparation of Local Adaptation Programme of \nAction  (LAPA)  planning  framework.  The  Community-Based  Vulnerability  Assessment,  Risk \nAssessment,  and  Adaptation  Planning  (CBVA)  initiative  will  produce  (i)  a  national  tool  for \nvulnerability assessment and adaptation planning at the community level for four different eco-\nregions, (ii) sample village-level adaptation plans and maps from sample communities and (iii) \ntraining modules designed for DDCs and VDCs in the use of the tools and preparation of \nassessment and maps.  The CBVA tool and sample maps are in the final stages of preparation. \nThe National Planning Commission has prepared a Climate Resilient Planning tool for long term \nclimate adaptation focusing on water, disasters, infrastructure, agriculture and forests sectors \nalong with climate risk screening format. The LAPA framework is being prepared through the \nDFID\u2019s support. UN-Habitat has recently started assessing the vulnerability of Kathamandu for \nimpacts of climate change through its Cities and Climate Change Initiative. The proposed TA \nwill utilize existing tools and training guidelines; develop new climate proofing/risk screening \ntools for key sectors and strengthen the Government and country\u2019s capacity to manage climate \nrisks at the national and local levels and within vulnerable sectors and groups.  \n \n4.  This note explains the expected scope of the activities and the resources (both human \nand time) most likely to be required for success. The detailed design of the activities must \nensure as much as possible that the Government\u2019s human and capital resources can sustain \nthe activities or that the results achieved by the project have long-term value and effects. \n \n \n ", "2  Supplementary Appendix B \nB.  The Output  \n \n5.  Output 2 of the proposed TA is Nepal has the information and skills to communicate and \nbuild knowledge on managing climate risks to key infrastructure sectors, stakeholders, and \nagencies. The objective is to strengthen the country\u2019s system for generating, managing, and \nsharing knowledge as an input to make Nepal climate resilient. Seven activities have been \nidentified as basic inputs into strengthening the knowledge services of key knowledge partners, \nnamely the MOE, major research universities1, District Development Committees and their local \ndevelopment partners.   \n \n6.  By  the  end  of  the  proposed  TA,  key  knowledge  partners  should  have  a  deeper \nknowledge of climate change, adaptation and resilience in Nepal, able to store and retrieve the \ninformation that such knowledge is based on, and should be communicating more regularly and \nclearly this knowledge. Specifically, the Government (namely the MOE) should be regularly and \nclearly communicating the newly acquired knowledge, key results and lessons learned during \nthe TA implementation period. \n \nC.  Activities  \n \n7.  A knowledge system uses a holistic cycle of creating, storing, and sharing knowledge. \nThe  MOE  does  not  have  an  evident  system  for  supporting  knowledge  development  or \nmanagement,  although  it  has  developed  its  capacity  to  share  information  and  knowledge \nthrough various web portals.2. These portals should continue to be used and improved, not \nreplaced. The TA should focus on supporting the creation of new information, managing that \ninformation as a service for knowledge partners and supplementing the existing web portals with \nnew information and additional communication activities. The seven activities of Output 2 are \ndescribed in more detail below and according to the knowledge function.  \n \n8.  All of the information and knowledge gathered and published needs to be securely \nstored and easily retrievable as the TA progresses and beyond the TA timeframe so that the \nMOE can continue to develop its knowledge base and knowledge services to the Government. \nThe  MOE  does  not  have  a  demonstrable  system  for  storing  information  or  processing \ninformation into knowledge. The closest MOE comes to knowledge management is a limited \npartnership with Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST). As an output of the NAPA \nprocess, the MOE established the Nepal Climate Change Knowledge Management Centre \n(NCCKMC) at NAST. (The MOE provided the NCCKMC with a $30,000 grant from the NAPA \nproject fund for its initial phase (September- December 2010).) The Center has a mandate to \naccomplish the following long-term activities: \n \n\u2022  Documentation, research, training and capacity development; \n\u2022  Facilitate access to information; \n\u2022  Provide policy and development planning advisory services; \n\u2022  Formulate and implement strategies to sustain the Center; and \n\u2022  Spearhead the establishment of regional centers.   \n                                                \n1 The universities will be named after the completion of the curriculum review under TA7173. \n2 NAPA website www.napanepal.gov.np and Nepal Climate Change Development Portal  www.climatenepal.org.np \nare not updated after the end of the NAPA project. The Pilot Program on Climate Resilience www.ppcrnepal.gov.np \nmentions a July 2010 workshop as a recent event and has not been updated. MOE website moenv.gov.np has \nbeen updated more frequently but requires substantial improvement to make it more accessible.  \n2 DFID jointly with the European Commission has proposals to support thirteen districts in the mid and far-western \nregions through its Nepal Climate Change Support Program.   ", "Supplementary Appendix B  3 \n \n9.  With GBP 65,000 of support under the Capacity Development Knowledge Network, \nNCCKMC is commissioned to do the following between July 2011-June 2012:  (i) capacity \nbuilding of NCCKMC staff through in-house trainings or trainings within the country or region; (ii) \nprovide learning opportunities to 25 young researchers (MSc thesis) on climate change and \norganise training for 25 young researches on research methodologies; (iii) organize policy \ndialogues (3 places) to familiarize decision-makers on Nepal\u2019s Climate Change Policy; (iv) take \nclimate change knowledge through mobile library to rural Nepal involving general public and \nstudents (book display in school, quiz contest with awards, talk on climate change, etc.; (v) \nimplement a communication strategy; and (vi) prepare a project report. An MOU was signed \nbetween NCCKMC/NAST and MOE for the above activities. \n \n10.  MOE is considering which of the following activities would be implemented by or through \ncollaboration  with  NCCKMC.  This  will  be  discussed  with  ADB  and  determined  during  TA \ninception.   \n \n1.  Knowledge Development  \n11.  The proposed TA supports three types of knowledge creation. Activities 2.1 and 2.2 use \nexisting tools to develop knowledge in people through education and training. Activities 2.3 and \n2.4 create and process new information into knowledge that is essential to advancing climate \nchange adaptation and in building national resilience.  \n \n12.  Activity 2.1 \u2014 Implement a District-Level Climate Change Training Program. TA \n7173  developed  two  tools  for  strengthening  local  level  planning\u2014the  district-level  climate \nchange  awareness  modules  and  the  community  based  vulnerability  assessment,  risk \nassessment and adaptation planning tool. While the training modules were developed under TA \n7173, the training program will be implemented under the TA with 622 district development \ncommittees (DDCs) with village development committee (VDC) representation. ADB will engage \na training service provider through competitive selection to implement the nationwide training \nprogram. The training program will be conducted in two stages: (i) general climate change \nawareness training for DDC and VDC leaders and civil society and NGOs stakeholders; and (ii) \ncommunity-based vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and adaptation planning for DDC \nplanning officers and VDC representatives. Specific measures will be incorporated into the \ntraining programs to ensure adequate proportion of female participants and representatives of \nmarginalized communities. It is expected that DDC planning officers who then lead communities \nin adaptation planning using their own resources and based the training provided. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework indicates a target of DDCs trained develop adaptation plans \nfor  100  communities.  The  effectiveness  of  the  trainings  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated \nthroughout the training program. A baseline survey, milestone survey, and post-intervention \nsurvey will be conducted by the TA development communications specialists. \n \n13.  Activity 2.2 \u2014 Update Educational Curriculum on Climate Science and Resilience. \nTA 7173 will have conducted a review of secondary and higher secondary curriculum and \ntertiary course outlines and made recommendations for revising the curriculum and tertiary \ncourse outlines and programs to reflect current climate science, impacts on Nepal, and the role \nof science and adaptation in building resilience. Activity 2.2 will support the implementation of \nthose recommended revisions. ADB would engage either independent specialist-consultants or \na service provider to facilitate two processes: firstly, the process of drafting new curriculum for \nGovernment textbooks at the secondary and higher secondary level; and secondly, the process ", "4  Supplementary Appendix B \nof  assisting  the  major  universities3 in  incorporating  the  recommendations  into  key  course \noutlines and programs. For revising the secondary and higher secondary curriculum, MOE will \ncoordinate among the consultants/service providers, the Ministry of Education (MOEdu), and \nvarious  Government  curriculum review  agencies. The revision  process  will  include  content \ndevelopment, agreement on the revised content, and actual incorporation of the content into the \nrelevant textbooks. The revisions should be timed to correspond with or contribute in a timely \nmanner to the regular curriculum review. This will ensure the revisions are included in the \nMOEdu\u2019s next printing of the textbooks. Activity 2.2 should also support teachers\u2019 training and \norientation on the revised curriculum. To accomplish this, the Activity 2.2 consultants must work \nwith  the  communications  consultants to  design  an  awareness  strategy  or  ensure that this \nactivity is incorporated into the project\u2019s master communications plan and budget.  Knowledge \ndeveloped through Output 1 should also be collected as potential to, in particular, engineering \nschool curricula. \n \n14.  For revising the course outlines and relevant programs at the tertiary level, MOE will \ncoordinate  between  the  consultants/service  provider  MOE  and  the  main  universities  in \nKatmandu and regional cities with the greatest volume of environmental science graduates. \nSince these courses do not rely on standardized texts, Activity 2.2 will support the universities\u2019 \nefforts to upgrade their course outlines, design new courses, and other opportunities identified \nduring  the  process  for  strengthening  the  environmental  science  education  that  university \nstudents would receive, in order to better prepare them for resilience work in the market, \nGovernment service, or academe. The TA will support regular information sharing/orientation to \nuniversity educators on guidelines, manuals and other products. \n \n15.  Activity 2.3\u2014 Small grants research fund. Participants of the TA design workshop \nsaid universities have abundant research ideas and needs, but limited resources to conduct \ncostly  field  visits  and  purchase  necessary  field  and  laboratory  research  technology,  i.e. \nenvironmental monitoring instruments, laboratory testing, etc. This activity supports a small \ngrants research fund that would encourage academic research on climate and environmental \nmanagement issues in Nepal. Proposals that focus on subject matter relevant to women and \nmarginalized groups will be promoted and prioritized. The NAPA technical assistance program \nalso offered a similar research fund and lessons from that experience are incorporated here. A \nmulti-stakeholder, semi-Government panel should be organized to design the criteria for the \nresearch fund. The specific arrangements for fund administration will be determined during TA \ninception,  following  consultant  analysis  and  recommendations.  A  service  provider  will  be \nengaged under the TA to manage the application process, mentoring, and dissemination of \nresearch findings from the various research projects supported by the fund.    \n \n16.  Activity  2.4\u2014  Document  traditional/indigenous  adaptation.  The  TA  supports  a \nresearch program to document traditional or indigenous adaptation practices, including those of \nwomen and disadvantages groups . Communities naturally adapt to change by building with \ndifferent materials, practicing different techniques and using natural resources differently. These \npractices  are  currently  not  being  documented systematically,  yet  could  be  valuable  to  the \nprofessional corps tasked to address these issues in engineering, management, and social \nprograms.  This information will be provided in the form of ethnographies to line agencies and \nconsultants participating in Output 1 who have expressed the need for more local level needs \nand coping mechanisms. The documentation will be done by a research-based civil society \ngroup engaged as a service provider. \n \n                                                \n3 These universities include Tribhuvan, Kathmandu, Pohkara and Purbanchal. ", "Supplementary Appendix B  5 \n2.  Knowledge Management  \n17.  Activity 2.5\u2014Knowledge Management Information System. The various activities of \nOutput  2  require  the  design,  testing,  and  implementation  of  an  electronic  knowledge \nmanagement system, or management information system (MIS). The standard MIS system for \nmanaging the SPCR and the proposed TA will be put in place, but Activity 2.5 relates to a \nsystem designed for gathering, storing, and producing knowledge products that meet the needs \nof various users. This electronic system would serve as the mechanism for stakeholders to send \ninformation related to the various SPCR components, outputs, and activities. As a mechanism, \nthe system would facilitate the processing of information into knowledge, and publication of \nappropriate quality and accurate knowledge products. Templates and forms for the various \nknowledge submissions would need to be developed for submitting to the system. The MIS \nwould  store  information  in  organized  ways,  i.e.  by  topic,  geography,  user  group,  funding \nsources, etc. While it would naturally have classified functions, the system should be developed \nto increase Government transparency about its national climate resiliency program. It should be \ndesigned with public access functions and strong usability for researchers, the media, and civil \nsociety.  \n \n18.  Either a specialist consultant or service provider will be engaged to design, build, and \ntest the system, as well as train designated MOE staff (with sufficient alternate provisional staff), \noversee initial implementation and be available for regular services and trouble shooting. The \nsystem would need to interface with the standard project MIS, which is storing monitoring, \nevaluations and overall SPCR results data. Coordination by consultants of this Output with \nthose in Output 1 will be needed to provide support and coherence with the data repository \nproposed in Activity 1.6 of Output 1. \n \n19.  An electronic knowledge management system supports the next phase in the knowledge \nprocess\u2014knowledge  sharing.  The  communications  specialists  and  their  MOE  counterparts \nshould  monitor  the  system  regularly.  The  system  would  be  a  shared  source  of  data  and \nknowledge from which to draw from for knowledge products.  \n \n3.  Knowledge Sharing \n20.  Information is not valuable until it is used and shared and understood. Only then does it \nbecome knowledge. Communications specialists, sociologists and participation specialists are \nkey development professionals in ensuring that the messages are not just sent, but received \nand used to positive ends. Communications should support the proposed TA\u2019s knowledge \noutcomes by: \n\u2022  supporting activities and events,  \n\u2022  publishing  knowledge  based  on  TA  results  and  experiences  and  feedback  from \nstakeholders,  \n\u2022  participating in the design of activities to ensure there are consistent opportunities for \nparticipation and communication \n\u2022  training  Government  staff,  consultants,  and  service  providers  on  the  role  of \ncommunications and knowledge sharing in their activities. \n\u2022  studying monitoring and evaluation findings for opportunities to use communications for \ncorrecting activities that are at-risk of underperforming. \n \n21.  Activity 2.6 Communications Strategy\u2014 The TA will support MOE\u2019s Climate Change \nSection  to  prepare  and  implement  a  communication  strategy  for  Nepal\u2019s  climate  change \nprogram, including expected program benefits, performance indicators, and lessons learned. ", "6  Supplementary Appendix B \nThe strategy will include dissemination of awareness-raising toolkits developed under TA7173, \nas necessary. The strategy should identify means and methods for communicating regular with \nvarious  stakeholder  groups.  The  strategy  should  also  be  accompanied  by  agreed-upon \ntemplates for various types of knowledge products to be developed during the TA, such as \npolicy briefs, news releases, event invitations, etc.  \n \n22.  Activity 2.7 Knowledge Products and Services\u2014The TA will develop and implement \nactivities  to  timely  and  continuously  inform  parliamentarians,  policy  and  decision-makers \nincluding local Governments on national and international climate change issues. Such products \nshould highlight the role and needs of women and marginalized groups in light of climate \nchange.  The  TA  will  support  the  Government  in  preparing  materials  for  international \nnegotiations on climate change. Similarly, the TA will assist the MOE\u2014as it is the Secretariat of \nthe  Climate  Change  Council  (CCC),  chaired  by  the  Right  Honourable  Prime  Minister\u2014to \ndevelop concept papers, case studies, and other necessary documents for meetings of the \nCouncil. The TA will provide similar information and knowledge support to the Multi-Stakeholder \nClimate  Change  Initiatives  Coordination  Committee  (MCCICC)  and  other  coordination \nmechanisms that might be developed on climate change-related matters. \n \n23.  The TA will support the MOE in communicating results and experiences from the SPCR. \nThe  TA  supports  a  system  for  monitoring  and  gathering  information  on  experiences  of \nGovernment officials and staff, consultants, and other stakeholders participating in implementing \nthe SPCR. These experiences would embody lessons on project management, stakeholder \ncoordination, new technical knowledge, and social knowledge as it relates to the process of \nbuilding a country\u2019s resilience to climate change. These experiences would be useful for other \ncountries preparing for or implementing SPCR or other projects related to climate change \nresilience, adaptation, mitigation, or environmental management.  \n \nD.  Human Resources \n \n24.  The implementing agency should have a mandate for research, knowledge management, \nand public communications. Without such a mandate, the Government agency could use an \nexisting relevant partnership or engage a quality service provider to implement the knowledge \nmanagement program.   \n \n25.  The  knowledge  management  program  will  likely  require  human  resources  from \nGovernment, consultants, and service providers. Government counterparts should be appointed \nfor supervising consultants and service providers, of which a minimal number will be required. \nConsultants and service providers need Government counterpart staff to ensure Government \nprotocols are observed while also transferring knowledge and skills, as well as introducing \ninnovation into Government processes. \n \n26.  Government human resources. The TA requires the following Government human \nresources for knowledge and communications activities. These counterparts may serve more \nthan one function with the SPCR project.   \n \n(i)  A chief communications official.  \n\u2022  Rationale: A Government spokesperson, tasked with communicating to \nthe public, increases both the visibility of the ministry and the transparency \nof Government\u2019s investments to address climate change. A designated \ncommunications official also makes the system of communicating more ", "Supplementary Appendix B  7 \nefficient  and  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  project  and  public \nstakeholders. \n\u2022  Estimated time required: Half day per week.  \n\u2022  Summary of TOR: This should be an MOE official with the authority to \napprove public communiqu\u00e9s produced by the TA/SPCR team about the \nproject (press releases, media inquiries, civil society communication). This \nperson should have the authority to speak publically on behalf of the MOE \nabout the SPCR. The chief communications official should have sufficient \nunderstanding and experience with the issues being addressed by the \nSPCR  and  knowledge  of  the  SPCR  administration  (project  design, \nimplementation  schedule,  progress,  financial  management).  The \ncommunications  consultants  would  provide  training  to  the  chief \ncommunications  official  and  other  relevant  management  and  staff  on \npublic relations, media relations, etc.  \n \n(ii)  Technical advisor for research program / curriculum review update \n\u2022  Rationale: The Government should lead all activities. A consultant\u2019s role \nis to advise and facilitate.  \n\u2022  Estimated time required: Half day per week  \n\u2022  Summary of TOR: The MOE should appoint a staff member competent \nin  the  climate  change  literature,  to  advise  the  research  program  on \nGovernment  research  priorities,  coordinate  among  other  ministries\u2019 \ncounterparts, and participate in key discussions and decisions on the \ndevelopment,  administration  and  results  of  the  research  fund.  The \ntechnical advisor would chair meetings of the quasi-Government/semi-\nautonomous body for preparing the research fund (see below).  \n \n(iii)  A  quasi-Government/semi-autonomous  committee  for  overseeing  the \nresearch fund \n\u2022  Rationale:  Independent  research  requires  autonomy  from  the  self-\ninterests of any individual or organization. \n\u2022  Estimated time required: Half-day, weekly committee meetings in the \ninception phase to agree on various aspects of research fund; half-day \nmonthly meetings once research grants have been awarded to monitor \nprogress and advise on outstanding issues.  \n\u2022  Qualifications:   The committee should be limited to 5-6 people in order \nto function efficiently and productively. An MOE technical advisor (see \nhuman resource listed above) should chair the board. Members should \ninclude  1-2  members  from  universities  and  1-2  from  civil  society. \nIndividual members seats could be offered to prominent environmental \nresearchers.  The  remainder  of  seats  should  be  appropriated  to \nGovernment representatives. \n\u2022  Summary  of  TOR: A quasi-Government committee should be tasked \nwith establishing the criteria for the grant fund administration. This body \nshould meet by committee to establish all criteria related to the scope of \nresearch, eligibility, application-review-approval process, monitoring, and \nresearch dissemination. A competitively procured research institute or \nfirm is advisable to administer the grants, supervise the technical quality \nof the research, and disseminate research findings based on the criteria. \nThe  development  communications/participation  specialist  consultant ", "8  Supplementary Appendix B \nshould be available support the committee in ensuring criteria is inclusive \nof gender and minority issues and encourages participatory methodology \nand dissemination.  \n \n(iv)  A knowledge management administrative counterpart. \n\u2022  Estimated time required: Part-time  \n\u2022  Rationale: The Government is the user and appropriator of certain kinds \nof knowledge. To build the Government\u2019s capacity to manage and share \nknowledge,  it  must  be  actively  involved  in  the  creation  and \nimplementation  of  such  a  system.  A  Government  counterpart  also \nensures that capacity is fully developed in the ministry and transferred \nfrom consultants to Government staff. \n\u2022  Qualifications:  A  working  level  Government  officer  familiar  with \nelectronic files systems and file management. This person should be able \nto  work  comfortably  with  the  various  SPCR  project  managers, \ninternational and national consultants, and other project stakeholders to \ndiscuss content to be fed into the knowledge management system. This \nperson should have the authority to communicate directly with content \nproviders  as  well  as  the  service  provider  engaged  to  develop  the \nknowledge management system. This person should have strong data \ncomputing skills, but also communication and organizations skills. \n\u2022  Summary of TOR: This person should participate in the design of the \nknowledge  management  information  system  (MIS)  to  ensure  its \nfunctionality is suitable for MOE and could be sustained. This person \nwould train other MOE colleagues and staff on use of the system. This \nperson would assist the MOE in ensuring the system is functioning and \nregularly  updated.  This  person  would  input  information  received \nelectronically  and manually from  various  stakeholders  and  inform  the \nvarious communications personnel about the status of new information. \nThis person would maintain the system and report problems.  \n \n(v)  A communications focal point. \n\u2022  Rational: The Government should actively participate in all activities. A \nconsultant\u2019s role is to advise and facilitate. \n\u2022  Estimated time required: Part-time \n\u2022  Qualifications: A working level Government officer with good oral and \nwritten communication skills. \n\u2022  Summary  of  TOR: The MOE focal point would assist the MOE and \nproject consultants in implementing the communications strategy. The \ncommunications focal point would work closely with the MOE knowledge \nmanagement focal point to ensure timely input of information and review \nsystem for valuable content to be shared. This person would assist in \nproject communiqu\u00e9s, event coordination, maintaining press clippings on \nthe  project,  assisting  in  stakeholder  coordination,  and  general \ncommunication.  This  person  would  advise  the  communications \nconsultants  on  protocol  and  liaise  with  stakeholders.  The \ncommunications consultants would provide ongoing training and support \nto  the  MOE  focal  person  and  other  relevant  Government  staff  for \ndeveloping inter-Governmental and public communication skills.   \n ", "Supplementary Appendix B  9 \n27.  Consultants. A minimal number of consultants will be needed to advise and assist the \nGovernment with a variety of training, research, and communication activities. The following \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  the  main  consultancy  services  package.  Terms  of \nreferences for consultants could be combined if a qualified candidate demonstrated the correct \nskills mix.  In general, the role of international consultants is to bring experience and good \npractice from other countries. They assist in the design of activities and monitor for timeliness \nand quality standards of the international agencies. The international consultants also share \nwith other countries their experiences from the Nepal project. The role of national consultants is \nto adapt good practice for the Nepal context. The national consultant advises their Government \ncounterparts and ensures  \n \n(i)  Development  communications/capacity  building/  participation  specialist \n(20 months, international, intermittent).

MOE\u2019s Climate Change Management Division (CCMD) will be primarily responsible for \nTA implementation. MOE will designate the National Project Director at Joint-Secretary level \nand  two  National  Project  Managers  at  Under-Secretary  level.  The  specific  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the director and managers will be delineated during TA inception. ADB will \nrecruit the main consultants to support MOE in TA management and climate change adaptation \nprogram management (see sections B and C below). The consultants will be housed in MOE \nand day-to-day supervision will be the responsibility of the TA managers. Funds needed to \nsupport all TA activities will be managed by MOE through the Advance Payment Facility (APF) \nset up between ADB and MOE. \n \n3.  The consultants working on Output 1 (see Supplementary Appendix 1) will be directly \nsupporting DWSS, DoR, DUDBC, DoI, DWIDP, DHM, MoLD, and DoLIDAR and will also work \nfrom offices in those agencies in order to perform their tasks. The TA managers and Project \nManagement Specialist/Team Leader will arrange for regularly team meetings of the consultants. \nThey  will  also  facilitate  regular  working-level  meetings  of  the  Government  personnel  from \nDWSS,  DoR,  DUDBC, DoI,  DWIDP,  DHM,  MoLD,  and  DoLIDAR  who  are  engaged  in TA \nactivities  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  1,  paragraph  35)  to  coordinate  activities  and  the \nassociated budget needed to facilitate meetings, trainings, etc in support of those activities.  \n \n4.

MOE will be supported by the TA to establish a results management function for its \nclimate change adaptation program which includes all five SPCR components and other climate \nchange adaptation programs such as the Nepal Climate Change Support Programme (NCCSP), \nEcosystems-Based  Adaptation  Programme,  and  Community-Based  Flood  Risk  and  Glacial \nLake Outburst Flood Risk Reduction1 (hereafter referred to collectively as \u201cOther Adaptation \nPrograms). This TA output on results management aims to monitor the progress of all climate \nchange programs under a single reporting framework to create a platform for shared learning \namong lead agencies and harmonization and reporting of results of all resilience building and \nadaptation initiatives in Nepal.  \n \n6.  Preparation of Results Framework. MOE will guide the preparation and refinement of \na  Climate  Change  Program  Results  Framework (CCPRF)  including monitoring  targets  and \nindicators (and associated baselines) that enable MOE to measure whether and to what extent \npeople in Nepal are able to adapt to climate change and whether and to what extent the \nGovernment\u2019s development programs, policies and projects are safeguarded from the effects of \nclimate change. (See Table 1, Initial Climate Change Programs Results Framework, which will \nserve as a starting point for collective development of the CCPRF). Each agency involved in \nleading or implementing SPCR components and Other Adaptation Programs and the respective \ndonors/development partners will actively participate in the preparation of the CCPRF. The \npreparation  of  the  CCPRF  will  be  guided  by  the  PPCR  Results  Framework2 and  Nepal\u2019s \nexperience  in  Managing  for  Development  Results  (coordinated  by  the  National  Planning \nCommission). The lead agencies will collectively develop the CCPRF that harmonizes individual \nmonitoring and evaluation exercises at the project level. A reporting and monitoring format, \nincluding reporting schedule, will be developed through a series of meetings and discussions \namong lead agencies during TA implementation. A focal person will be identified for each \nagency and form a working committee to undertake these processes and will work closely with \nResults Management consultants hired under the TA. \n \n7.  Management Information System. A management information system (MIS) will be \nestablished to implement the monitoring and coordination of all progress indicators in line with \nthe CCPRF. A MIS specialist will be employed to build user capacity within each lead agency so \nthat project directors or their designees may individually update and input project progress. \nMOE will then be able to see status information of activities and results in real-time. A summary \nof progress results will be automatically fed to MOE\u2019s climate change web portal so the public is \nalso kept regularly informed.  \n \n8.  Program Coordination. Face-to-face dialogue will still be needed among lead agencies. \nMOE will call quarterly meetings of each project director to discuss key issues affecting their \nprogress and share implementation experience and feedback related to meeting specific project \ntargets  and  expect  outputs.  The  Climate  Management  Division  (CCMD)  of  MOE  will  be \nresponsible for setting up the meeting and agenda for discussions in coordination with each \nagency\u2019s focal person.   \n  \n9.  Bi-Annual  Reviews  of  Each  Component.  It  is  expected  that  each  supervising \ndevelopment partner -- e.g., ADB for SPCR Components 1 and 3, DFID/EC for NCCSP, IFC for \n                                                \n1 MOE may also consider including in the results framework and coordination climate change components of other \nprojects and programs, such as the Multi-stakeholder Forestry Programme. \n2 http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/cif/sites/climateinvestmentfunds.org/files/PPCR%204%20Results%20Frame\nwork%20nov2010_1.pdf ", "Supplementary Appendix C  3 \nSPCR Component 4, and World Bank for SPCR Components 2 and 5 -- will conduct review \nmissions at least twice annually to monitor performance against the agreed-upon monitoring \nframeworks for each project/component. MOE will participate in these review missions and, with \nsupport of the results management specialists, assess progress and performance in meeting \nthe expected results stated in the CCPRF. MOE will also document and disseminate lessons \nlearned based on its consistent monitoring of all program components.  \n \n10.  Progress will be assessed based on indicators and targets for the identified outputs, \noutcomes and impact reflected in the project/component\u2019s design and monitoring framework or \nlogical framework. Data for specific indicators will be collected and reported annually along with \nany baseline data surveys that are needed during detailed project design or at the beginning of \nproject implementation.  Any deviation from target and achieved results will be dealt with in a \ntimely manner to allow for corrective actions at the early stages of implementation. Necessary \nevaluation activities such as field visits, review and analysis of progress reports will also be \nconducted to collect necessary data for determining the project progress. \n \n11.  Program Reviews. A review of Nepal\u2019s Climate Change Adaptation Program will be \nconducted every 2 years against the CCPRF, supported by the TA. Each project director and \nresponsible development partner will participate in the program review. At each review, the \nCCPRF will itself be assessed and amended as necessary. MOE will produce and make public \na program evaluation following each review.  \n \nC.  Program Results Management Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Government Roles \n12.  The CCMD of MOE is responsible for the daily coordination and results management of \nNepal\u2019s Climate Change Program and is headed by a government official from Joint Secretary \nlevel. The agency\u2019s key responsibilities will include setting up quarterly meetings among lead \nagencies to discuss the progress of program activities and call for discussions if and when \nnecessary; provide regular updates and identify priority issues for immediate attention under \nresults management functions; facilitate administrative and coordination work related to the \nmaintenance and operation of management information system and ensure timely and accurate \nreporting by lead agencies on the progress of their activities. The CCMD will be assisted by one \nnational  Project  Management  Specialist,  one  international  Climate  Change  Results \nManagement  Expert,  and  one  national  Management  Information  System  Specialist.  It  is \nenvisaged  that  working  closely  with  these  consultants  will  allow  the CCMD  to  develop  its \ncapacity to coordinate and monitor progress of climate change activities necessary for Climate \nChange programming in Nepal. The CCMD will be responsible for the oversight of the results \nmanagement  function  of  the  TA  and  provide  guidance  on  the  climate  change  programs \nmonitoring and reporting. Specifically a Climate Change Program Coordination Committee has \nbeen created for this purpose and is chaired by the Honorable Minister for Environment and co-\nchaired  by  the  Member,  National  Planning  Commission  (Environment).  The  CC  Program \nCoordination Committee will report progress to the Climate Change Council and the Multi-\nStakeholder Climate Change Coordination Committee. \n \n2.  Consultants  \n13.  A  minimal  number  of  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  Government  in \ncoordinating and performing results management responsibilities both for the TA and other \nclimate change programs.

Overview of Financial Management and Procurement Capacity Program \n17.  A Fiduciary Risk Assessment (FRA)3 was conducted by ADB in August 2011 to assess \nthe capacity for financial management and internal control of MOE as executing agency for the \nTA.  The  FRA  specifically  reviewed  the  management  and  handling  of  authorization  of \nexpenditure, payment modalities, cash and bank, financial accounting, reimbursement of funds, \nprocurement and asset management focusing primarily on the practices and experiences of the \nMOE during the implementation of TA 7173. \n \n18.  Several risks have been identified in financial management and procurement, especially \nin the light of significantly greater financing and larger scale of the TA compared with TA 7173 \nand other projects previously managed by MOE.  These include: i) inadequacy of manual \naccounting  system  to  record  and  report  expenditures  that  will  be  involved  in  the  TA;  ii) \nsignificant proportion of project expenditure transacted in cash causing risks such as lack of \ntransparency,  difficulty  in  verification,  and  personal  security  among  others;  (iii)  loss  of \ninstitutional  knowledge  in  managing  donor  funded  projects  in  case  of  transfer  of  project \npersonnel; and iv) environmental factors in relation to procurement.  \n \n19.  To assist MOE in mitigating the abovementioned potential risks, several strategies have \nbeen recommended under the FRA. Accordingly, three major areas of support to MOE have \nbeen agreed to be implemented under the TA: (i) introduction of project accounting software for \nmanagement of an advance payment facility; (ii) reduction of cash handling using alternative \nmethods  of  payment  and  effective  transaction  level  authorization  of  expenditure;  and  (iii) \ncapacity  building  for  internal  control,  financial  management  and  procurement.  To  assist  in \nimplementing this capacity development program, engagement of Procurement Specialist and \nFinancial Management Specialist and roll out of workshops and capacity building activities will \nbe undertaken under the TA. \n \nE.

Background \n1.  To  effectively  generate  impact from  climate  risk management  in  Nepal,  the  TA for \nMainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in Development (referred as TA) has been \nprepared  to  complement  existing  and  proposed  activities  supported  by  other  development \npartners (DPs) in the country. Some capacity development initiatives are being undertaken by \nother DPs in support of Nepal\u2019s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA). The TA \ngenerally  responds  to  NAPA  by  building  knowledge  and  capacity  on  climate  change  risk \nmanagement. This note summarizes the Government capacity building initiatives in climate \nchange adaptation and climate risk management.  \n \nB.  Development Partners  \n1.  UK  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  and  the  European \nCommission (EC) \n2.  In the preparation of NAPA, Nepal undertook an expanded NAPA with co-financing \nmobilized  from  DFID,  Danish  International  Development  Agency  (DANIDA)  and  UNDP  to \nsupplement  funding  from  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  to  focus  on  knowledge \nmanagement planning and wider stakeholder participation and coordination. The Expanded \nNAPA  included  three  components  as  follows:  (i)  preparation  and  dissemination  of  NAPA \ndocument; (ii) development and maintenance of climate change knowledge management and \nlearning  platform;  and  (iii)  development  of  Multi-stakeholder  Framework  Action  on  Climate \nChange in Nepal.  The Expanded NAPA project has concluded and the TA will build on its work \nby supporting knowledge management, information / education / communications (IEC) and \nmulti-stakeholder coordination.  \n \n3.  As part of NAPA, Local Adaptation Programmes of Action (LAPA) Framework is also \nbeing developed to identify local adaptation needs that will match priorities under NAPA through \nintegration of top-down and bottom-up approaches in mainstreaming adaptation into planning. \nLAPAs are plans prepared at the local level by a multi-stakeholder team including vulnerable \ncommunities. DFID has committed funding for LAPA, with an initial pilot phase for testing its \nfeasibility and effectiveness undertaken through Climate Adaptation Design and Pilot Testing \u2013\nNepal  (CADP-N).  This  pilot  phase  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  specific  adaptation \ninterventions for NAPA Profile 1 Project in key sectors such as agriculture, forestry, health, \nwater supply and sanitation and watershed1.  CADP-N will inform the framework of the Nepal \nClimate Change Support Programme (NCCSP), jointly supported by DFID and EC, to assist \nlocal level climate change adaptation and build institutional capacity building at the national \nlevel. The program will be implemented in 13 districts in the mid and far western regions. See \nTable 1 for the expected outputs under NCCSP. \n \n4.  The TA will collaborate with NCSSP by building adaptation capacity and conducting \ntrainings in districts outside their scope of work. As NCSSP plans to cover 13 districts with \nplanning and implementation, the TA will cover 62 districts in planning. The TA\u2019s main focus is \non  facilitating  the  mainstreaming  of  climate  change  in  development  planning  and  key \ndevelopment sectors by building understanding and capacity for climate risk management at \n                                                \n1 Districts targeted for assessment and pilot testing included: Dhading, Nawalparasi, Rukum, Accham, \nIlam, Udayapur, Kaski, Kapilbastu and Kalikot districts.  ", "2  Supplementary Appendix D \nnational and local level. This is envisaged to complement DFID\u2019s and EC\u2019s support in the \nimplementation of climate resilient development plans and strategies by local government and \nmost  vulnerable  groups.  Tools  developed  under  the  Community  Based  Vulnerability  and \nAdaptation Planning (CBVA) initiative2 (in collaboration with the CADP-N team) and from global \nand regional models (supported by TA 7173) will be shared with DPs to further harmonize \nclimate change adaptation tools in Nepal. Collaboration will be further undertaken in the use of \nscreening tools for development projects to avoid duplication of efforts in key sectors. TA will \nwork closely with DPs in knowledge sharing of national and international climate change issues \nto national and local government offices.  \n \n2.  Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) \n5.  GIZ\u2019s work in assisting climate change resilience to local government will be part of its \nSub-national Governance Programme (SUNAG) currently in the early planning stage. SUNAG is \nspecifically  focusing  on  local  government  which  is  one  of  its  priority  areas  in  the  country \noperation and where various interventions such as climate change adaptation support are \nenvisioned.  Generally  the  program  aims  to  assist  policy  development  of  sub-national \ngovernments, enable sub-national actors to assume their new tasks effectively and promote \ninteractions among these actors in its planned areas of interventions. It will be implemented in \nsix districts such as Banke,Bardiya, Surkhet Dailekh, Kalikot and Kailali with more priorities to \nbe given to urban areas. At this stage however, detailed plan of work, including key sector focus \nand project approach, has yet to be prepared by GIZ.  \n \n6.  Climate risk management manuals and guidelines and climate screening tools from the \nTA will be shared with GIZ in building capacity of the local government in climate change \nmitigation measures. GIZ has indicated that they will not develop any climate change related \nmaterials and tools and will mainly focus on training and capacity building activities given its \nexisting network with regional learning centers and the urban development training center. \nThus, sharing climate risk manuals and guidelines and assessment tools will be a value-addition \nto the work of GIZ and will enable the TA to widen its reach at local levels at the same time. \nInformation sharing will be continued as GIZ finalizes the design of SUNAG. \n \n3.  United National Development Programme (UNDP) \n7.  In  recognition  of  the  multiple  risks  and  hazards  facing  Nepal,  UNDP  adopted  the \nComprehensive  Disaster  Risk  Management  Programme  (CDRMP)  to  effectively  meet  the \ndemands of the country. It has been formulated as part of the Bureau of Crisis Prevention and \nRecovery and UNDP\u2019s Strategic Partnership Framework and in accordance with the flagship \narea of Institutional and Legal Systems for Disaster Risk Management assigned to UNDP \nthrough Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium. The Agency has also supported GoN in formulating \nthe currently approved National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management.  \n \n8.  CDRMP is a five year program aiming to strengthen the institutional and legislative \naspects of disaster risk management in Nepal which includes climate risk induced disasters. Its \nactivities include building the capacity of key Government ministries, local bodies, academia, \ncivil  society,  the  private  sector  and  communities  under  program\u2019s  key  focus  areas  of    (i) \ninstitutional and legislative system for disaster risk management; (ii) strategic linkages with other \n                                                \n2 The CBVA is supported by ADB under TA7173: Strengthening Capacity for Managing Climate Change \nand the Environment. ", "Supplementary Appendix D  3 \nsectors; (iii) climate risk management; (iv) community-based disaster risk management; (v) \nemergency preparedness and response; and (vi) early recovery.  \n \n9.  The TA will collaborate with UNDP in some of its core program areas. Particularly, the \nTA will share climate change risk management and screening tools and training manuals for \ncapacity building at the national and local level to complement UNDP\u2019s general approach of risk \nmanagement from all type of hazards through disaster management planning, preparedness \nand response. Community-Based Vulnerability Assessment (under TA 7173) will also be shared \nwith UNDP for harmonizing climate risk assessment tools in relation to the integrated climate \nrisk assessment that they plan to undertake at the local level. Other activities under climate risk \nmanagement  activities  include  support  to  community-based  climate  risk  management  and \nstrengthening  local  level  early  warning  system  which  are  not  directly  covered  by  the  TA. \nCollaboration  will  also  be  undertaken  at  the  local  level  through  sharing  climate  change \nresearches documenting traditional/indigenous adaptation practices to complement the goal of \nUNDP of training local government in response and emergency management system. UNDP \nplans to mainstream disaster risk reduction into higher education and close coordination will be \ndone by the TA to avoid selection of the same universities. Likewise UNDP plans to support \nNational Administrative Staff College for DRR course into their training package and UNDP will \ncoordinate with the TA. Collaboration in supporting key sectors in building capacity to assess \ndisaster risk will also be done through sharing climate-specific training modules and information \nto help in the area of climate change risk management in the overall disaster risk reduction \napproach of UNDP.
