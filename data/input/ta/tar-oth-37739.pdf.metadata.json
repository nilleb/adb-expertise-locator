Lack of adequate financial sector regulation and supervision was one of the major \ncauses of the Asian financial crisis. In addition to policy and governance issues, inadequate \ncapacity of banking supervisors and securities regulators was identified as a key constraint to \nimplementing the best international practices in financial sector regulation and supervision in \nmany of the affected countries.  In response, finance ministers of member economies1 of the \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) endorsed the establishment of the APEC Financial \nRegulators'  Training  Initiative  (FRTI)  in  May  1998  to  enhance  training  efforts  for  financial \nregulators at national and regional (i.e., within Asia) levels. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas been acting as secretariat to the FRTI and has financially supported its training activities \nunder various technical assistance projects (TA).2 Considering progress achieved under the \nFRTI and the continued need for training in this area, APEC finance ministers, in September \n2003, extended the FRTI for a third time and requested a continuation of ADB\u2019s role. ADB has \nalso been approached for support by other regional cooperation initiatives in the financial sector, \nincluding for pension regulators. Such cooperation is expected to contribute to a harmonization \nof standards and practices in financial sector regulation and supervision across the region. The \nTA framework is presented in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Financial stability is crucial for sustained economic growth and cannot be achieved \nwithout strong financial systems. Effective financial sector supervision promotes stability by \nensuring that financial institutions operate in a safe and sound manner.  Financial institutions \nmust have adequate risk management policies and procedures and operate with sufficient \nlevels of capital. Skilled supervisors are key to effective financial sector supervision. Supervisors \nmust understand the risks inherent in financial activities and must be capable of assessing the \nadequacy of risk management policies, systems, and practices of financial institutions under \ntheir supervision. Most DMCs are committed to implementing the core principles for banking \nsupervision and securities regulation developed by the Bank for International Settlements and \nthe  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions,  respectively,  which  require  well-\ntrained  regulators  and  supervisors.  The  FRTI  and  other  initiatives  have  considerably \nstrengthened training programs at national and regional levels after the Asian financial crisis. \nThere is scope for further improving training programs for DMC financial regulators in line with \ninternational standards to ensure that staff actively involved in supervision and enforcement \nactivities possess the necessary competencies.   \n \n3.  The FRTI has had separate programs for banking supervisors and securities regulators. \nThe banking supervision program receives major TA support from the United States Federal \nReserve System. The securities regulation program has used instructors from regulatory and \nother relevant institutions in APEC member economies for its training courses. The work of the \nFRTI receives oversight through APEC advisory groups representing bank supervision and \nsecurities regulatory agencies from member countries and other interested parties. \n \n                                                           \n1   Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; \nJapan; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; Philippines; Russia; \nSingapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; United States; and Viet Nam.  \n2   ADB. 1999.

Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for \nFinancial Regulation and Supervision. Manila (TA 5966-REG, approved on 27 December 2000 for $800,000), \nincluded components for this purpose.   \n3   The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 November 2003. ", "2  \n4.  The  FRTI  has  made  good  progress  in  achieving  its  two  original  objectives:  (i) \nstrengthening  content  and  management  of  national  training  programs  and  (ii)  developing \nregional programs for junior and mid-level supervisors and regulators. The FRTI has trained \nmore than 1,300 developing member country (DMC) participants (including 108 from non-APEC \nDMCs) in 19 regional and 13 national courses.  Courses in banking supervision covered bank \nanalysis, credit risk analysis, market risk analysis, risk management and internal controls, and \non-site  supervision,  with  course  content  reflecting  the  Basel  Committee's  Core  Principles. \nCourses in securities regulations focused on generic training topics that are related to market \nsupervision and investigation and enforcement, and are relevant for countries at different stages \nof capital market development. In addition, seminars were held on current regulatory issues \nsuch as demutualization and investor education. The FRTI also developed audiovisual training \nproducts covering the core areas in banking supervision training (i.e., bank analysis, credit risk \nanalysis, and market risk analysis), as well as a web-based self-study course for newly hired \nsecurities regulators.  Feedback from supervisory agencies indicates that the training programs \nhave been well received by participants and that training materials developed under the FRTI \nhave been used and incorporated in national training programs.  For example, FRTI's self-study \nmaterials are given to incoming staff of these agencies to address their immediate training \nneeds until formal training courses are scheduled. \n \n5.  To sustain the achievements of the FRTI, training institutions at the regional and, more \nimportantly, national level, will have to assume greater responsibility for the delivery of course \ncontent developed as part of this initiative. To facilitate this process, the APEC finance ministers \nrecently extended the FRTI for a further year with the aim of (i) delivering additional training \ncourses at the regional level to help build a critical mass of potential trainers, and (ii) organizing \nthe transfer of training programs and products developed under the FRTI to training institutions \nat the national and regional levels.   \n \n6.  The finance ministers also endorsed an enhanced advisory group structure, principally \nfor (i) monitoring the status of financial regulators\u2019 training in the region; (ii) reviewing the \neffectiveness of existing training programs and approaches; (iii) identifying emerging training \nneeds of financial regulators and discussing new approaches to address such needs; and \n(iv) facilitating the exchange of information on training events, resources, materials, and best \npractices.   \n \n7.  The  Financial  Action  Task  Force\u2014the  organization  with  primary  responsibility  for \ndeveloping  a  worldwide  anti-money  laundering  framework\u2014has  made  a  number  of \nrecommendations on how regulators and supervisors of financial institutions should implement \nthe framework. For financial institutions subject to the Core Principles, many regulatory and \nsupervisory measures that apply to prudential purposes should apply in a similar manner to anti-\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing purposes.  Other financial institutions, including those \nin the insurance and pension sectors, that can be conduits for money-laundering activities, \nshould  be  properly  licensed  and  regulated  in  line  with  national  anti-money-laundering \nrequirements. While anti-money laundering legal and regulatory frameworks have recently been \nupgraded in many DMCs, supervision and enforcement capacity has lagged behind.  No training \nprograms are currently available at regional or global level that address the specific training \nneeds of supervisors in this area.     \n \n8.  Many pensions systems in Asia, as in other regions, are being transformed from public \npay-as-you-go into funded systems with varying degrees of private pension provision. The \ndevelopment of funded pension systems needs to be accompanied by efforts to strengthen the \nfinancial  market  infrastructure  and  the  establishment  of  a  modern  and  effective  regulatory ", "  3\nframework  for  private  pensions,  which  protects  the  rights  of  beneficiaries,  encourages  the \nsoundness  of  pension  funds,  and  promotes  the  stability  of  the  pension  system  and  the \neconomy.  The  International  Network  of  Pension  Regulators  and  Supervisors  (INPRS)  was \nestablished  in  2000  as  a  forum  for  policy  dialogue  and  exchange  of  information  between \nmembers on regulatory, supervisory, and financial issues, with the aim of promoting (i) the \ndevelopment  of  private  pensions  systems  complementary  to  public  systems;  (ii)  the \ndevelopment  of  an  adequate  regulatory  structure  and  financial  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  the \nimplementation of best practices and principles. Regional networks have been established \nwithin INPRS. An Asia-Pacific regional network was inaugurated in 2002 to, among other things, \nhelp organize training and research seminars specific to the region and to exchange study \ngroups among countries in the region.   \n \n9.  ADB has been an observer member of the Asia-Pacific regional network and has been \napproached about hosting and cosponsoring its next annual regional meeting in 2004. The \nannual  meeting  and  an  associated  conference  on  private  pensions  in  Asia  will  be  jointly \nsponsored  and  organized  by  ADB  and  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD).  Both events are intended to reinforce the development of INPRS, \nfollowing previous regional meetings in Asia\u2014PRC (2001), the Republic of Korea (2002), and \nIndia (2003)\u2014and facilitate discussions among regulators of key issues related to the regulation \nand supervision of private pensions in the region. Issues include (i) governance of private \npension  funds;  (ii)  rights  of  beneficiaries  and  their  education;  (iii)  adequate  investment \nregulations;  (iv)  appropriate  supervisory  structures  and  methods;  (v)  the  management  of \npension  funds  for  government  workers;  (vi)  the  design  and  distribution  of  pensions  and \ninsurance  products  in  emerging  markets;  and  (vii)  financial  risk  management  in  insurance \ncompanies and pension funds.    \n \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n \n10.         The TA will help strengthen the capacity of financial sector regulators and supervisors \nin Asia through support for regional training efforts and seminars on key sector issues.  The TA \nis expected to facilitate the incorporation of international best practice approaches to financial \nsector regulation and supervision in training programs at regional and national levels.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.         The proposed TA will have three components. \n \n12.       Component A will support a continuation of the APEC FRTI for a further year through the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  additional  training  courses  for  financial  regulators  and \nsupervisors  in  DMCs  and  developed  Asian  APEC  economies  in  line  with  training  priorities \nidentified by advisory group members. The component will help complete training curricula and \nmaterials and build a critical mass of potential trainers in the region.  For banking supervision, \nthis will include a new course on risk-focused supervision. In addition, existing courses, such as \nthe special training-of-trainers course and courses on market risk analysis and risk management, \nincluding  operational  risks  related  to  information  technology  and  internal  controls,  will  be \nrepeated to increase the number of potential trainers in DMC supervisory agencies.  As much as \npossible, efforts will be made to include case studies that are relevant to the conditions and \nissues  faced  by  supervisors  in  different  types  of  DMCs.  For  securities  regulation,  another ", "4  \ninvestigation and enforcement course will be implemented, which will use more case studies \n(including from within the region) than earlier courses, in response to feedback received from \nparticipants. All courses will be open to participants from Asian APEC economies and non-APEC \nDMCs. Training materials and seminar papers will be disseminated through the external ADB \nFinance and APEC FRTI web sites and/or distributed directly to DMC financial supervisory \nauthorities  and  regional  training  institutions  such  as  the  South  East  Asian  Central  Banks \n(SEACEN) Research and Training Centre, whose staff will also be invited to join the training \ncourses organized under the TA. The TA will further support the management of the FRTI's \nenhanced advisory group structure.   \n \n13.  Component B will support the development and implementation of specialized training \nprograms for banking, securities, pensions, and insurance regulators and supervisors on the \nincorporation of anti-money laundering concerns in their supervision and enforcement activities.  \nRelated  training  materials  and  curricula  will  be  disseminated  to  supervisory  agencies  in  all \nDMCs. \n \n14.  Component C will support the next annual seminar of the INPRS regional network and \nthe associated conference mainly by funding travel expenses of resource speakers from Asia \nand other costs associated with holding the conference.   \n                       \n15.  Detailed terms of reference for the TA consultants are given in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000. Foreign exchange costs in the amount of $400,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The United States Federal \nReserve Bank and other APEC regulatory and supervisory agencies will make contributions in \nkind through the provision of instructors and workshop venues and facilities.  OECD would be \nfunding resource persons from outside the region. The cost estimates and financing plan of the \nTA are given in Appendixes 3 and 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.   ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA.4 \n \n18.      The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months commencing in January 2004.  \nThe TA will involve a total of about 6 person-months of international consulting services. The \ninternational consultants, who will have expertise in devising and conducting training on financial \nsupervisory issues, will be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. All resource persons financed under the TA will be from ADB member \ncountries.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n4  The Finance and Infrastructure Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSFI) has \nmanaged the FRTI on behalf of ADB for the last 2 years.  However, this function might be transferred to the \nRegional Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU), if overall responsibility for acting as ADB\u2019s APEC focal point is shifted \nfrom RSFI to REMU.
