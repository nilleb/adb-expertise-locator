Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have an important role in trade, contributing \nsignificantly to economic growth and job creation. However, a substantial gap exists in their \naccess to financing. The Trade Finance Gaps, Growth and Job Survey published in October 2021 \nshowed a global trade finance gap of $1.7 trillion in 2020, with more than 40% of rejected trade \nfinance transactions coming from SMEs.1 The gap has grown over the course of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic, rising from $1.5 trillion in 2018, and is likely increasing further as \ninflation raises the value of transactions, thereby lowering the ability of existing country and \ncounterparty financing limits to meet demand.  \n \n2.  The gap is exacerbated by a lack of capacity on the part of both SMEs and local banks to \nprovide supply chain finance. SMEs have difficulty accessing supply chain finance for a variety of \nreasons.  Banks generally consider them to have a higher risk profile, more difficult to serve, and \ninvolve higher transaction costs. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding among SMEs and \nbanks on how supply chain finance works and its benefits. Supply chain finance can provide more \ntimely access to working capital from financial institutions at more reasonable rates for SMEs not \nserved by traditional bank financing since it leverages the strength of a larger corporate entity and \nincorporates the history of performance and interdependence of relationships between it and \nSMEs within a supply chain.  \n \n3.  The Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) works with partner financial \ninstitutions (PFIs) to close financing gaps of SMEs. TSCFP is composed of the Supply Chain \nFinance Program  (SCFP)  and  the Trade Finance Program  (TFP)  which  were  operationally \nmerged in 2020. Whereas TFP takes bank risk to support cross border trade, SCFP shares \ncorporate risk with partner financial institutions to support both domestic and cross-border supply \nchains.  While  TFP  has  scaled  into  one  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  largest \nbusinesses\u2013in 2020, TFP supported over 7,000 transactions valued at $5.8 billion\u2013the SCFP is \nsmall but growing rapidly. Merging these two businesses is helping SCFP scale up by leveraging \noff  TFP\u2019s  existing  relationships  and  experience,  while  achieving  operational  efficiency  and \ndelivering even better client service. \n \n4.  The SCFP arm of TSCFP was established in November 2012 with a limit of $200 million \nto support trade and broaden the financing instruments offered to SMEs for accessing working \ncapital.2 In March 2018, the program expanded both in terms of its program limit and its scope \nwhen additional financing of $100 million was approved, increasing the total program limit to $300 \nmillion.3 SCFP operates in 10 of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) and has seen rapid \ngrowth recently. In 2020, SCFP supported 1,447 transactions, an increase of 151% from the \nprevious year, with the overall transaction value increasing 108% to $246 million.   \n \n5.  To further reduce SME financing gaps and as a response to strained supply chains \nbrought about by the pandemic throughout Asia, including for companies that manufacture and \ndistribute food products, medical products, and equipment, the SCFP in June 2021 received \napproval to incorporate on a permanent basis the COVID-19 specific scope changes it was \n \n1 ADB. 2021.

Manila. \n3 ADB. 2018.

Closing SME finance gaps delivers significant development impact by furthering growth \nand job creation and therefore reducing poverty. The proposed TA cluster will build on the ongoing \nwork under the previous SCFP TA Cluster6 to continue implementing and expanding SCFP in \nview of the continuation and expansion of special policy variations under ADB\u2019s COVID-19 \nresponse approved in June 2021 (footnote 5). An important element of the TA cluster, and a \nfeature that also distinguishes SCFP from TFP, concerns its focus on assessing and monitoring \nSME and corporate risk, and support of open account payment terms. ADB needs to enhance its \nexperience and resources in assessing and monitoring this risk, which impedes its ability to \nimplement projects directly impacting DMC SMEs. The TA cluster will fund the engagement of \nconsultants who will focus on obligor risk assessments, relationship management, program \nadministration, transaction processing and portfolio management to support SCFP operations. \nWhile the primary beneficiary of the TA will be DMC companies, an ancillary beneficiary will be \nADB itself. ADB\u2019s own technical capacity in working with DMC companies will be enhanced and \nthis will position ADB to consider and implement new SME-supportive projects in the future.  \n \n7.  Since supply chain finance is relatively new or does not materially exist in some markets, \ncontinued capacity building and knowledge-sharing events are important to support both the \ngrowth of this product line and SCFP. The TA cluster will undertake activities related to capacity \ndevelopment for DMC banks to develop supply chain finance business models, with a view to \nsubsequently signing risk-sharing agreements with these banks to include them as  partner \nfinancial institutions (PFIs). As the program also aims to play a stronger role in addressing gender \nequality constraints in supply chains, this TA cluster will enhance SCFP\u2019s ability to deliver \u201cgender \nlens\u201d financing capacity building and training to improve banks\u2019 customer service to female \nclientele. \n \n8.  The proposed TA cluster is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.7 It provides support to \nSCFP which facilitates trade and investment by strengthening the capacity of domestic financial \ninstitutions  to  encourage  and  expand  access  to  banking  and  financial  services  in  DMCs \n(Operational Priority 7).  It has a demonstration effect on non-partner financial institutions that are \nnot yet providing supply chain finance. It likewise tackles Operational Priority 1: Addressing \nRemaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities Pillar 2 Quality Jobs Generated by providing \ngreater access to finance for SMEs in DMCs and helps to create jobs, stimulate growth and \nimprove livelihoods. Through SCFP\u2019s promotion of gender equality in banking by facilitating \ntraining and workshops to female bank staff in DMCs, the TA cluster supports Operational Priority \n2.  \n \n9.  Inclusive finance is one of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, \nwhich was reaffirmed in its 2017 review.8 One component of the strategic focus of ADB\u2019s Private \n \n4  ADB. 2020.

Through the TA cluster, SCFP will be able to facilitate \nthis by encouraging private-sector contributions to supply chain finance and enabling ADB to \nprovide support to SMEs. \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n10.  The transaction TA cluster will provide capacity building support to continue activities \nundertaken under the first SCFP TA approved in 20139 and subsequent TA cluster approved in \n201810 by engaging consultants to assist in the expansion of the program and implementation of \npipeline deals over the next 3 years. In addition, capacity development towards DMC bank \nimplementation of supply chain finance will be deployed. A cluster modality has been adopted for \nthe TA because it: (i) provides an opportunity to conduct financial analyses and diagnostics over \na longer period without tying down the entire TA resource requirements at the outset; (ii) allows \nthe TA to be more responsive to the needs of banks by enabling an annual \u201crepeat engagement\u201d \napproach that builds on the analysis and benchmarks derived during the previous year; and (iii) \nwill reduce processing costs compared to individual standalone TA projects.  \n \nC.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n11.  Overall outcome. The TA cluster\u2019s overall outcome will be expanded uptake of supply \nchain finance in DMCs. It will help strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to \nencourage and expand access to banking, insurance, and financial services for all, thereby \nmeeting an important sustainable development goal.11 Through a combination of knowledge \n \nproducts, loans, guarantees, and funded and unfunded risk participations, DMC SMEs and \ncorporates will receive more financing and PFIs can leverage ADB\u2019s participation to broaden their \nsupply chain finance portfolios. This will be measured in terms of the program\u2019s increase in the \nnumber and value of supply chain transactions. Each TA subproject will generally deliver some \nor all the following outputs, as specified by each transaction TA subproject proposal:  \n \n12.  Output 1: Capacity to provide supply chain support through SCFP partner banks \nenhanced. This will be measured based on: (i) the increase in the number of countries in which \nthe program is active; and (ii) increase in number of supported transactions involving SMEs. The \nTA cluster will enable ADB to continue to engage consultants who will assist in the implementation \nof the program by: (i) conducting in-depth due diligence and risk analyses on DMC companies, \nincluding SMEs in which ADB would assume risk under the program, (ii) administering SCFP \ntransactions, and (iii) performing monitoring assessments on DMC companies, DMC banks and \nPFIs. \n \n13.  Output 2: Support of gender-inclusive supply chain finance expanded. This will be \nmeasured based on: (i) the increase in number of DMC banks introducing or expanding supply \nchain finance products, (ii) percentage (at least 50%) of DMC banks participating in SCFP\u2019s \ntechnical assistance receiving gender lens financing12 capacity building, (iii) institutional capability \nto record sex-disaggregated data introduced in the ADB cofinanced Supply Chain Finance \nPlatform for selected DMC banks13, (iv) increase in the number of large global banks participating \n \n9  ADB. 2013.

The TA cluster will fund the engagement of consultants and \nresource persons who will: (i) deliver targeted technical support to selected DMC banks that have \nbeen assessed for their capacity and commitment to build a supply chain finance business with \nthe aim of onboarding them as PFIs after 3-4 quarters of intensive capacity building in supply \nchain finance, (ii) establish and strengthen supply chain finance relationships with new and \nexisting PFIs, including both global and local banks, and (iii) deliver gender lens financing capacity \nbuilding (footnote 29). \n \n14.  Output 3: Bank staff training in supply chain finance and gender balance expanded. \nThis will be measured based on: (i) increase in number of bank staff in DMCs participating in \nonline or in-person capacity building activities in relation to supply chain finance (of which at least \n30% should be women14); and (ii) percentage (at least 50%) of DMC banks participating in SCFP\u2019s \ntechnical assistance receiving training focused on improving banks\u2019 customer service to female \nclientele15. The TA cluster will fund related knowledge-sharing and partnership activities including \nseminars, webinars, in-person and/or online trainings for DMC banks on the functions and \nbenefits of supply chain finance, how it works and how to attract financing, to help them initiate \nsupply chain finance services, including enhancing customer service to female clientele as well \nas on issues related to SME financing such as anti-money-laundering and sustainability. \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n \n15.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $4,500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF \u2013 donor contribution and/or TASF \u2013 income \ntransfer).  \n \n16.  The TA cluster will cover remuneration, travel and per diem for international consultants \nand  national  consultants,  conference-related  expenditures,  and  miscellaneous  expenses. \nDetailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject \nproposal submitted for approval. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for \napproval to the Director General of the Private Sector Operations Department in accordance with \nthe business process for transaction TA cluster processing. Subproject activities will start only \nafter the project concept for the corresponding ensuing project is approved by ADB. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  December 2021\u2013November 2024 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  PSOD \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nPackage title  Selection method   Engaged by  \n \n14 Male - female baseline is not available for e-training as the provider (International Chamber of Commerce Academy) \ndoes not track sex-disaggregated data for online training.
