During the Country Programming Mission (CPM) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin April 2003, the Government of Bhutan (Government) requested a technical assistance (TA) \ngrant  to  help  Government  prepare  a  comprehensive  sector  assessment,  identify  the  key \nconstraints on small and medium enterprise (SME) development, and formulate a program for \nthe effective promotion of SMEs to foster private sector development, generate employment, \nand reduce poverty. This TA is in line with the financial sector development program for Bhutan, \nas agreed upon by the CPM and the Government. An advisory TA is included in the Bhutan \nCountry Strategy and Program Update for 2004\u20132006. A Fact-Finding Mission1 visited Bhutan in \nMarch 2004 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan 2002\u20132007 (9FYP) anticipates annual gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth rates of 7\u20139%. To achieve these growth targets, the 9FYP emphasizes \nstrengthening infrastructure, improving the quality of social services, ensuring good governance, \npromoting private sector growth and employment generation, and preserving Bhutan\u2019s culture \nand environment. The task of absorbing an estimated labor force of 70,000 that will enter the \nlabor market during the 9FYP is challenging and adds urgency to the promotion of private sector \nactivity.  Implementation  of  planned  financial  sector  reform  and  a  parallel  thrust  on  SME \ndevelopment will result in increased competition and productivity. Given the growing concerns \nover the expanding labor force, government policies have started to put more emphasis on \nprivate sector development and financial sector reforms.  \n \n3.  As public sector employment opportunities will be limited, the private sector, particularly \nSMEs, is expected to play a greater role in absorbing the growing number of young and \neducated Bhutanese. Despite recent efforts, however, the Government still has limited capacity \nto  effectively  formulate  and  implement  policies  for  SME  promotion.  Although  Bhutan \ndemonstrated strong economic performance in recent years, continued improvements in the \nfinancial system will be necessary to support the country\u2019s further development. Much of \nBhutan\u2019s economic growth and financial sector development has been driven by the public \nsector, as reflected in the high rates of growth in hydropower and savings of government \ncorporations. Growth in the private sector remains slow since savings mobilization is low and \nviable investment projects are limited. \n \n4.  Prior to the opening of the economy in the 1950s, the only private sector activity was in \nagriculture  supplemented  by  some  trading  activities.  Since  then,  the  economy  has  seen \ntransformation with rapid growth in urban centers, establishment of basic infrastructure services, \nand development of an important hydropower sector. Reflecting the nascent stage of the private \nsector, Bhutan\u2019s economy is dominated by cottage and micro industries that comprise about \n85% of the country\u2019s total establishments. As of December 2001, Bhutan has about 409 small-\nscale and 43 medium-scale enterprises in industry, production, and manufacturing. The country \nalso  has  about  878  cottage  and  2,435  mini  enterprises.  The  major  challenge  for  the \nGovernment is to increase the activity of the private sector, which now contributes less than \n25% of Bhutan\u2019s GDP.  \n                                                 \n1  Comprising V.V. Subramanian, Financial/Capital Markets Specialist, and Y. Elhan-Kayalar, Economist, SAGF. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 May 2004. \n ", "2  \n5.  Small and micro industries must be developed to enhance Bhutan\u2019s rural income and \nemployment. The 9FYP aims to focus on a legislative framework for industrial development, \nincluding formulation and enactment of legislation for industrial policy, transfer of technology, \nand foreign direct investment, apart from initiatives for developing the capital market. The main \nthrust for the industry sector during the 9FYP will be to create industrial estates around the \ncountry to facilitate the development of the SME sector. \n \n6.  The development of the SME sector is thus all the more critical for overall development \nof  the  economy  (Appendix  2).  Though  there  is  no  precise  definition  of  SMEs  in  Bhutan, \ninvestments of above Nu100 million are currently classified as large, while investments up to \nNu100 million are categorized as micro or cottage, small or medium, based on the invested \ncapital. Though the Government, through the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and Ministry \nof Agriculture, has taken a number of initiatives, the impact has so far been negligible. Given the \nimportance of the SME sector in the economy of Bhutan and understanding the constraints \nunder which the sector operates, it is evident that policies and an institutional framework to \nsupport the development and growth of SMEs are necessary. A more concerted and holistic \napproach is needed to address the various factors impeding the growth of the sector. Market \ndevelopment is a much more challenging task, which requires coordinated efforts by individual \nenterprises, the chambers of commerce, and the Government. \n \n7.  The Department of Industry is entrusted with the responsibility to foster sustainable \nindustrial  development  in  harmony  with  national  objectives  and  priorities.  Accordingly,  its \nfunctions are promotional as well as regulatory, by nature covering the industry sector classified \nbroadly under manufacturing and services. At present, the sector operates under the General \nGuidelines for Industrial and Commercial Ventures in Bhutan (1997). However, the country does \nnot have an established legal framework or supporting rules and regulations for the sector. A \ndraft business licensing act has been prepared but is yet to be enacted into law. Under the \nprovisions  of  the  proposed  act,  MTI  will  consolidate  and  frame  rules  and  regulations  for \nbusiness activities in Bhutan. The Foreign Direct Investment Policy was approved by the \nCouncil of Ministers on 3 December 2002 and the executive order to treat the policy as \nregulations  until  it  is  enacted  was  issued  on  the  same  date.  Rules  and  regulations  to \noperationalize the policy have already been drafted.  \n \n8.  SMEs in Bhutan face a number of constraints to growth: (i) lack of entrepreneurial talent, \n(ii) lack of basic skills, (iii) lack of modern technology, (iv) lack of capital, (v) restricted access to \nfinancing, (vi) absence of clear-cut government policies for the SME sector, (vii) lack of research \nand development facilities, (viii) poor physical infrastructure and high transportation costs, and \n(ix) poor information about market opportunities and requirements. Therefore, systematic and \nin-depth studies are needed to clearly identify the operational constraints of the different sector \ncategories. At the micro level, institutional support will be required to assist SMEs to link with \ncommercial sources of funds, acquire better marketing information, especially about domestic \nand  export  markets,  and  strengthen  their  abilities  to  prepare  business  plans.  The  focus, \nhowever, should be on promoting markets, and market-based provision of finance and support \nservices, with the public sector providing key interventions by setting policy and monitoring \nperformance. \n \n9.  Bhutan's exports are mostly to India under the free trade agreement, with about 4% to \nBangladesh under the preferred trade agreement. With India\u2019s accreditation to the World Trade \nOrganization,  Bhutan's  exports  are  no  longer  competitive.  Not  only  does  Bhutan  need  to \nimprove its competitive strength; it must also look to markets beyond India and Bangladesh. \nThere is an urgent need to make SMEs internationally competitive by providing them with ", "  3\nsupporting  services  such  as  quality  control,  facilitating  networking  and  clustering, \ncommercializing  research  and  development  through  technology  incubators,  providing \nappropriate incentives, and promoting regional cooperation by encouraging the networking of \nSME support agencies. \n \n10.  Bilateral assistance for Bhutan in SME development has been forthcoming in a limited \nway\u2014from Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers (SNV), Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ), and  United Nations Development Programme\u2014and focused in the \nareas of training in basic skills and developing business development services centers. Despite \nrecent efforts by the Government and external agencies, a framework for SME promotion is \nstill incomplete, in terms of both policy and institutions. Since MTI is not yet adequately \nstaffed, the Government has been unable to effectively formulate and implement policies for \nSME promotion. Therefore interventions need to be complemented by a more focused and \ntargeted approach for the overall SME sector. The Entrepreneur Development Program (EDP) \nloan scheme was launched in 1992 with capital funds of Nu100 million set aside by four \nfinancial  institutions  and  was  intended  to  address  the  financing  needs  of  individuals  who \nsuccessfully  completed  the  comprehensive  entrepreneurship  course  (CEC),  conducted  by \nEntrepreneurship Promotion Center-MTI. Of the 193 persons trained under the CEC program, \nonly 47 could avail themselves of financial assistance until 2003. Of that 47, only 14 are \noperating satisfactorily, six are facing operational problems, and the rest have either closed or \nare facing litigation. Though performance under the scheme has been rather disparate, the EDP \nloan scheme was a step in the right direction. However, the program has not received much \ninterest as the financing conditions were too restrictive. In addition, the Government established \nin 2003 a credit guarantee scheme to improve the flow of finance from the two commercial \nbanks where loans up to a maximum of Nu200,000 will be guaranteed to the extent of 60% by \nthe Government. Under the ADB-assisted Basic Skills Development Project,3 the Government \nestablished five vocational training institutes to provide training in 13 basic craft and arts skills. \nHowever, getting qualified trainers has been a constraint. This facility has been supplemented \nby a parallel assistance of $2.5 million from GTZ.  \n \n11.  Nevertheless, Bhutan's SME sector continues to face challenges that relate to the \nnascent stage of the private sector in the Bhutanese economy. Despite recent efforts by the \nGovernment and external agencies, a framework for SME promotion is still incomplete, in terms \nof both policy and institutions. The Government has limited capacity to effectively formulate and \nimplement policies for SME promotion. The overall framework is essential for SME development \nthat encompasses other constraints and issues that have been enumerated. In addition, close \ncoordination among funding agencies is important to address the issues surrounding SMEs. \nThe TA will seek active coordination and ensure complementarities between the initiatives of \nother institutions and those of ADB. \n \n12.  The Labor Law, drafted with the assistance of an ADB-funded TA, is yet to be enacted \ninto law. Assistance will be required to develop rules and regulations once the law is enacted. It \nis expected that 80% of the labor force currently in the SME sector will be covered by the \nproposed Labor Law. The Business Licensing and Registration System also needs to be \nstreamlined  with  laid-down  procedures  and  guidelines.  Though  the  Cooperatives  Act  was \nenacted in 2002, it is not yet operational as the rules and regulations are still to be framed. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

To support the development and growth of the SME sector in Bhutan, three targeted \nactions should be pursued: (i) formulate and implement an SME policy, (ii) create an enabling \nenvironment for SMEs, and (iii) promote the growth of targeted business support services. For \nthis purpose, diagnostic studies of the SME sector are required to identify what further policy \nand institutional support need to be established to develop the sector.  The provision of \nbusiness support services also needs to be examined for sustainability through either the \nprivate or public sector. Key support services include skills training, trade fairs, appropriate \ntechnology know-how, marketing linkages, and business support services. In addition, existing \ninstitutional mechanisms and financing modalities for SMEs need to be examined to improve \nfinancial services for the SME sector. The examination may build on the private sector survey \nconducted under a World Bank study in 2002. \n \n14.  Regional cooperation is a key issue for the development of a landlocked country like \nBhutan. ADB projects (such as the proposed dry port development, and road network) have \nregional cooperation as one of their thematic areas. As a member of the South Asia Association \nfor Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bhutan signed the South Asia Free Trade Agreement in \nJanuary 2004 and committed itself to bring down customs tariffs during the next 10 years after \nthe agreement comes into force. In February 2004, Bhutan became a member of BIMST-EC.4 \nThe aim of the group is to foster socioeconomic cooperation among the member countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n15.   The TA will help formulate a focused and sustainable framework for SME promotion, \nconsistent with the broad vision of the Government on SME development. The output of the TA \nwill include a full sector assessment, identifying the key constraints on SME development; a \ndiagnostic  analysis  and  time-bound  action  plan  tailored  to  Bhutan;  and  a  comprehensive \nframework  and  strategy  for  SME  promotion  including  business  development  services  and \nenhancing SME access to credit for the medium and long-term. After an in-depth analysis of the \nissues,  a  road  map  will  be  developed  that  will  provide  the  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for the SME sector. The overall framework will involve (i) completing a \npolicy and institutional framework for SME promotion including improving market and other \nrelated information provision to SMEs; (ii) strengthening the system for capacity building for \nSMEs, including technical centers for enhancing the current industrial and technical standards \nand information on technology transfer and access to market information for SMEs; and (iii) \nimproving the bankability of SME projects and SME access to the financial system through \nbetter practices, methodologies, and instruments.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The  TA  will  initially  undertake  an  in-depth  diagnostic  study  of  the  SME  sector, \nparticularly, existing interventions; identify the key constraints and from the findings, decide \nwhat further policy and institutional support need to be established for developing the sector. A \nseries of studies will be prepared for this purpose, built on existing studies and supplemented, \nwhere  necessary,  by  additional  analyses,  interviews,  and  surveys  of  SMEs,  and  in  close \nconsultation with the Government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and representatives \nof funding agencies and the business sector. The findings will help provide the necessary \n                                                 \n4  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal Economic Cooperation. ", "  5\nunderpinning for further strategies and actions and assist in developing an integrated strategy \nfor promoting SME business in Bhutan. The data will indicate how business support services \nare to be provided on an ongoing sustainable basis\u2014through either the private or public sector. \nIn addition, appropriate policy and incentives will be identified for improving the bankability of \nSME projects and existing institutional mechanisms and financing modalities for SMEs will be \nexamined to improve aspects of financial services for the SME sector. \n \n17.  The TA will further provide for a 2-week overseas study tour of selected officials from \nMTI, Ministry of Labor, and Ministry of Law to a couple of the newly industrialized economies to \nstudy and understand the policy initiatives taken and support services provided in developing \nSME sector. As the TA will require close consultation with stakeholders, workshops will be \norganized and other opportunities will be available to build consensus on the outputs of the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $375,000  equivalent,  comprising  $279,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $96,000 equivalent in local currency.  The TA will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $21,000 equivalent of the local currency cost on a grant basis.  The TA will \nbe  financed  as  a  grant  by  the  Government  of  Denmark  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $75,000 equivalent of the local costs, including provision \nof counterpart staff, office space, administrative services, and physical facilities. The cost \nestimate and the financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The MTI will be the Executing Agency for the TA. To facilitate TA implementation, a \nworking committee will be established headed by the secretary of  MTI, with representatives \nfrom the ministries of labor as well as law. The TA will be implemented over 4 months from \nJanuary to April 2005 and will require four international consultants (9 person-months total) and \none  domestic  consultant  (3  person-months).  The  consultants  will  submit  to  MTI,  the \nGovernment, and ADB an inception report 2 weeks after the work starts. An interim report \nbased on the diagnostic analysis will be submitted 6 weeks after the start of the TA and will be \ndiscussed at a tripartite meeting of the Royal Monetary Authority, Government, and ADB. The \ndraft final report with the detailed framework for SME development will be submitted 2 weeks \nbefore the completion of the project and will be discussed at a tripartite meeting of the principals \nof the TA. The final report will be submitted after incorporating comments at the end of the \nconsulting  period.  The  international  consultants  will  be  an  SME  sector  development  or \nbusiness specialist, as project team leader; SME legal and regulatory specialist; SME \nfinance specialist; and an SME business development services specialist. The domestic \nconsultant will be an industry specialist. An international consulting firm will be recruited, using \nsimplified  technical  proposals  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Recruitment of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof Bhutan to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Denmark for Small and Medium \nEnterprise Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n       \nDevelopment of Bhutan\u2019s  Increased SME activities  Government statistical reports   \nsmall and medium  and their contribution to   \nenterprise (SME) sector  economic growth  Technical assistance (TA) \nresulting in improved    steering committee meetings \neconomic growth,     \nemployment, and poverty    TA review meetings \nreduction     \n  Ministry of Trade and Industry \n(MTI) report and publications \n \nPurpose       \n       \nFormulate a focused and  Comprehensive  Feedback from stakeholders  Continued focus and thrust on \nsustainable framework for  framework and strategy  and consensus on reform  SME development and poverty \nSME promotion   for SME promotion  design  reduction by all stakeholders \n   developed including    and in ADB country strategy \n  business services and  Consultants' reports  and program \nenhanced SME access to     \ncredit for the medium and  Tripartite meetings  Government concurrence on \nlong- term    recommended action plans \n  Asian Development Bank   \n(ADB) review missions   Coordination among all \n  concerned agencies \n   \n  Lending institution commitment \n  and support \n \nOutputs       \n       \nFull sector assessment  Issues and constraints to  Consultants' reports  Government support and \nidentifying the key  SME development    commitment to reform \nconstraints in SME  identified within 6 weeks  Tripartite meetings   \ndevelopment, a diagnostic  after the TA begins,      \nanalysis and time-bound  including sectoral issues  MTI reports and feedback   \naction plan tailored to  for policy formulation     \nBhutan developed    ADB review missions   \n       \n       \n  Strategies and actions to  Consultants' reports  Commitment to implement \n  address bottlenecks in    recommended action plans \n  SME development  Tripartite meetings   \n  decided within 12 weeks    Coordination with agencies and \n  after the TA begins  MTI reports and feedback  financial intermediaries  \n       \n    ADB review missions  Government support and \n      commitment \n       \nCost and risks related to  Integrated policy, legal,  Consultants' reports  Stakeholder participation \nSME financing reduced  regulatory, and   \n  institutional framework  Tripartite meetings \nBankability of SME  developed together with   \nprojects improved  appropriate incentives for  MTI reports and feedback \n  overall development of the   \nContinued on next page ", "Appendix 1  7\n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nNeed for complementary  SME sector within 2  ADB review missions \nbusiness support services  weeks from TA   \nassessed  completion.    \n     \nWorkshops      \n   \n   \n \n \nActivities \n(i)  Diagnostic analysis of the SME sector (including sectoral issues for policy formulation) conducted  \n(ii)  Past performance of SME sector reviewed in respect of capital investment, employment generation, value of \nproducts or exports and value addition, and any other performance features;

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bhutan \n \nThe development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has significant implications for poverty reduction. SMEs \nwill enhance the current economic structure, income, and employment-generating activities; reduce income fluctuation \nof individuals and businesses and thus contribute to macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. \n \nSMEs are the prime drivers of new employment. The task of absorbing a labor force of 70,000 expected to enter the \nlabor market in Bhutan during the Ninth Five-Year Plan 2002-2007 (9FYP) is challenging and adds urgency to the \npromotion of private sector activity. Implementation of planned financial sector reform and a parallel thrust on SME \ndevelopment will result in increased competition and productivity. Given the growing concerns over the expanding \nlabor force, government policies have started to put more emphasis on private sector development and financial \nsector reforms.  \n \nAs public sector employment opportunities will be limited, the private sector, particularly SMEs, is expected to play a \ngreater role in absorbing the growing number of young and educated in Bhutan. Given its high multiplier effect on the \nnational economy, the SME sector is critical for financing and policy intervention to support the growth rate of the \neconomy. The Project will support the Government's recognition of the significant role SMEs can play in achieving \nnational development goals and its efforts to realize the 9FYP objectives of annual gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth rates of 7-9%. The major challenge for the Government is to increase activity of the private sector, which now \ncontributes less than 25% of Bhutan\u2019s GDP. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Poverty Classification \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nSMEs enhance competition and entrepreneurship and hence have external benefits on economy-wide efficiency, \ninnovation, and aggregate productivity growth. They will help exploit the social benefits from greater competition and \nentrepreneurship, will lead to more productivity, and boost employment more than large firms as SMEs are more labor \nintensive. The government has rightly recognized the tremendous role the SME sector can play in terms of job \ncreation and labor mobility. \n \nSMEs are therefore vital for the country to absorb the labor force of 70,000 expected during the 9FYP, and to \nstimulate employment intensive growth in rural areas, moving workers out of agriculture. Private sector SMEs are \nlikely to be the main source of investment opportunities that generate economic growth and create employment. The \nsocial and poverty impact will be appropriately analyzed while recommending the policy and reform framework for the \nSME sector. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes   No  \n \n Social assessment will have the participation of the following main stakeholders: SME entrepreneurs, the two \ncommercial banks, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Labor, other related government agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, and selected bilateral agencies. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nThe key aim of the Project is to support the Government's recognition of the significant role SMEs can play in \nachieving national development goals and its efforts to realize the 9FYP objectives. Therefore, the emphasis of social \nassessment  will  be  on  a  participatory  process  aimed at SME sector development. The assessment will ensure the \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nparticipation of various stakeholders through such methods as participatory stakeholder interviews, focus group \ndiscussions, and participatory rapid appraisal.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nOne among the many priorities will be improving knowledge about female entrepreneurship and its role in the \neconomy and society, improving knowledge about financing of women-owned businesses and removing obstacles in \nthis area, fostering the development and growth of women-owned businesses, and fostering an entrepreneurial \nculture through improved education management training for women and girls.
