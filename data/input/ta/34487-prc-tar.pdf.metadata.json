The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the assistance of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the country programming mission in July 2003, to \nsupport  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  in  improving  its  capacity  to \nsupervise foreign banking organizations (FBOs) in the PRC. The Fact-Finding mission visited \nthe PRC in September 2003 and reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government on the \nobjectives,  scope,  cost,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  technical \nassistance (TA). The TA framework is in Appendix 1. 1 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As an integral part of the banking sector reforms, the PRC Government has opened up \nits banking market to FBOs by gradually removing barriers to entry. Although FBOs have had a \npresence in the PRC since 1949, 2 they were not allowed to engage in local currency business \nuntil 1996. In 1998, 3 selected FBOs were for the first time allowed to participate in domestic \ncurrency interbank lending and to gradually expand their geographical outreach. Attracted by \nthe increasing demand from foreign enterprises in the PRC and the PRC\u2019s strong economic \ngrowth potential, FBOs rapidly increased the number of their branches4 to 157 by October 2003.  \n \n3.  CBRC  was  established  in  April  20035 to  assume  the  regulatory  and  supervisory \nfunctions of financial institutions from the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC). This \nstep was taken to draw a line between banking supervision and monetary policy in order to \nprevent PBC from using banking supervision as a tool of monetary policy by way of liquidity \ncontrol and access. CBRC is responsible for supervising PRC branches and agencies of FBOs \nas  well  as  domestic  commercial  banks  and  nonbank  financial  institutions.  The  main \nresponsibilities of CBRC are to (i) issue regulations and provide regulatory guidelines related to \nfinancial institutions; (ii) examine and approve the establishment, abolishment, and modification \nof financial institutions, their branches, and their scope of business; and (iii) conduct on-site and \noff-site supervision of financial institutions based on laws, regulations, published manuals, and \ninternal  guidelines  and  procedures.  CBRC  has  regional  offices  in  each  of  36  provinces, \nautonomous regions, and municipalities. The head office and regional offices engage in the \nsupervisory activities for FBOs. \n \n4.  Under the PRC\u2019s World Trade Organization (WTO) accession requirements, the PRC \nwill open its banking market by gradually removing its restrictions on FBOs\u2019 activities. FBOs\u2014 \nwhich were allowed to engage in foreign currency business with Chinese enterprises and \nindividuals at the time of the PRC\u2019s accession to WTO\u2014will be allowed to engage in local \ncurrency services for domestic enterprises by December 2003, and for domestic individuals by \nDecember 2006. FBOs\u2019 geographic restrictions have also been gradually removed and will be \ncompletely abolished by 2006. This, combined with expected strong economic growth, is likely \nto cause a surge of FBO activities in the PRC over the next few years. Importantly, the more \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 July 2003. \n2  Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation, Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, and   \nStandard Chartered Bank maintained branches in Shanghai, but only for foreign currency business. \n3  Between 1996 and 1998, FBOs were allowed to make loans to and take deposits from foreign enterprises in \ndomestic currency. \n4  FBOs also have subsidiaries and representative offices in the PRC. There are also several foreign joint venture \nbanks. However, most of the FBOs\u2019 activities are held in branches and this TA is focusing on the supervision for \nFBOs\u2019 branches in the PRC. \n5  CBRC was established under a Government restructuring plan ratified by the National People\u2019s Congress. The \nGovernment is now in the process of amending related laws to finalize the restructuring plan.    ", "2 \nadvanced management practices and business know-how at FBOs are likely to introduce \ngreater competition in the banking system, forcing domestic banks to reform and improve their \nperformance to maintain their market share.  \n \n5.   Although FBOs\u2019 activities will  have a positive impact on the PRC\u2019s banking sector, \nunless properly supervised, FBOs\u2019 increasing activities in the PRC could increase systemic risk \nin the banking sector. FBOs will prove to be important players in the PRC\u2019s banking market6 \u2014 \nFBOs will start to make local currency loans to domestic enterprises in December 2003 and to \ncollect local currency deposits from domestic individuals in 2006. Thus, the PRC authorities \nmust effectively supervise FBO branches to ensure the soundness of the PRC\u2019s banking system. \n \n6.  Foreign licensed financial institutions have occasionally violated domestic regulations\u2014 \ne.g., Barings in Singapore, Daiwa Bank in New York, and Credit Swiss in Tokyo\u2014showing that \na sophisticated financial institution based in a well regulated financial market is not free from risk. \nThe failure to adequately regulate foreign affiliates is a common feature of all these cases and, \nin some circumstances, the lack of internal procedures in banks to ensure compliance with \ndomestic regulations and lack of appropriate information sharing between home and host \nsupervisor7 made matters worse. A supervisory framework needs to be developed for FBOs, \nespecially a framework to effectively assess, evaluate, and monitor the risk management, \ninternal control, and compliance of FBOs and to cooperate and share information between \nhome and host supervisors. This will mitigate the risk and help ensure the soundness of the \nfinancial markets in both host and home countries. \n \n7.  The rapid progress in financing techniques and risk management systems in commercial \nbanks requires the strengthening of the banking supervision in the PRC and elsewhere. The \nloan migration model for credit risk management used in commercial banks in developed \neconomies  is  a  challenge  that  regulators  face  in  assessing  the  validity  of  banks\u2019  risk \nmanagement systems. Many foreign banks operating in host countries use these technologies \nto increase profit and manage risk. Assessing risk management systems requires especially \nwell-trained and highly skilled regulators. \n \n8.  The PRC has been relying mainly on capital requirements and restrictions on the scope \nof business activities and geographical areas to manage  FBO activities. These regulatory \nmeasures are inadequate to mitigate risk in FBOs. Recognizing this constraint, the newly \nestablished CBRC is seeking to adopt a risk-based supervisory framework focused on internal \ncontrol for FBO branches. \n \n9.  The PRC\u2019s accession to WTO will encourage a  change in supervision of FBOs. The \nrestrictions on the scope of business and geographical area will be abolished by 2006. Other \nregulations of FBOs\u2019 business activities will be  reviewed to ensure equal treatment between \ndomestic banks and FBOs. The abolition or modification of existing supervisory tools demands \nthat a new framework be designed to effectively supervise the activities of FBOs in the PRC.  \n \n10.  The existing internal procedures and published supervisory manuals of CBRC are not \nsufficiently  comprehensive  to  effectively  assess,  evaluate,  and  monitor  either  domestic  or \n                                                 \n6  Currently, the market share of FBOs in the PRC is relatively small, only 1.4 % in terms of total assets in June 2002. \nRegarding the prospect of FBOs\u2019 market share in the future (2010\u20132015), there are a wide variety of estimates \nranging 5\u201330 %.   \n7  \u201cHome supervisors\u201d refers to the banking supervisory authorities of the countries where the head office of the FBO \nis located, and \u201chost supervisors\u201d refers to the banking supervisory authorities of the countries where foreign \nbranches of the FBOs are located.  ", "    3 \nforeign banking organizations. Although the quality of supervisory activities has improved by \nestablishing these procedures and manuals, CBRC needs further strengthening. CBRC needs a \nmodern supervisory framework by which it can comprehensively evaluate and identify weaker \nareas of banks. CBRC also needs a mechanism for sharing information among its regional \noffices. FBOs need to understand the supervisory procedures, which can be arranged through \npublished CBRC operations manuals. Many domestic banks need improvements in internal \ncontrol and/or risk management systems and effective supervision by CBRC will contribute to \nthe improvements. \n \n11.  As a first step, CBRC envisages establishing a comprehensive supervisory framework \nfor the PRC branches of FBOs. CBRC has started preparatory and drafting works for a new \nsupervisory  framework  for  FBOs,  including  manuals,  guidelines,  and  a  supervisory  rating \nsystem. However, consultation with international experts and training opportunities for CBRC \nstaff are necessary to fully assimilate the practices in other countries and make the new \nframework  effective  and  consistent  with  the  best  international  practices.  Therefore,  the \nGovernment requested ADB assistance for the establishment of a new supervisory framework \nfor FBOs. \n \n12.  The PRC Government is also strengthening its supervision of domestic banks. PBC \npublished guidelines on commercial banks\u2019 internal control in 2002. CBRC is now establishing \nguidelines on credit risk management of commercial banks. The draft guidelines emphasize the \nimportance of the internal control structure. Although these guidelines are an important first step \ntoward  risk-based  and  internal-control-focused  supervision,  more  will  have  to  be  done  to \nestablish a comprehensive framework. As many FBOs are expected to have an effective \ninternal  risk  management  system  and  internal  control  practice,  CBRC\u2019s  experience  in \nsupervision of FBOs will help the regulatory agency upgrade its capacities in supervising \ndomestic banks. \n \n13.  ADB has been supporting the Government\u2019s efforts in reforming its financial sector, \nstrengthening  banking  supervision,  and  facilitating  its  complete  integration  into  the  global \nfinancial  market  through  several  projects,  such  as  Banking  Laws  and  Regulations,8 and \nStrengthening Banking Supervision and Liquidity Risk Management. 9 ADB\u2019s strategy in the \nPRC Country Strategy and Program Update 2003\u20132005 emphasizes improvement of banking \nsupervision and  strengthening of banking management with specific focus on WTO-related \nissues. Assistance for the establishment of an effective framework to supervise FBOs will \nreduce the risks arising from FBOs\u2019 activities in the PRC, expedite the reduction of existing \nrestrictions  on  FBOs,  facilitate  FBOs\u2019  activities  in  the  PRC,  and  improve  the  institutional \ncapabilities of CBRC in assessing, evaluating, and monitoring banks\u2019 risk management, internal \ncontrol, and compliance.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) establish an effective supervisory framework for FBOs \nwhile not undermining the equal opportunities for foreign and domestic banks, in particular, to \ndevise appropriate methodologies for evaluating FBO branches by assessing and monitoring \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

The TA will undertake specific activities in following areas: \n \n(i)  establish an effective supervisory framework for FBOs comprising \n(a)  a supervisory rating system to evaluate the risk levels and identify weak \nareas, \n(b)  a supervisory information system to share information between CBRC \nstaffs in regional offices, \n(c)  streamlining of supervision activities according to the risk level, \n(d)  supervision manuals and guidelines for on-site and off-site supervision, \nand \n(e)  a  mechanism  for  cooperation  and  information  sharing  with  home \nsupervisors based on the best international practices prescribed by the \nBasel Committee documents;10 and  \n \n(ii)  improve the capacity of CBRC staff in banking supervision by \n(a)  disseminating  the  new  supervisory  framework  through  seminars  and \nworkshops, and \n(b)  organizing domestic and overseas training program for staff of CBRC. \n \nC.        Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent comprising  a foreign \nexchange cost of $310,000 and a local currency cost of $240,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $90,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $150,000 through the provision of counterpart staff, office space, \nand contingencies. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan of the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.        Implementation Arrangements \n17.  CBRC\u2019s Banking Supervision Department III (BSD3) will be  the Executing Agency.  A \nworking group will be established, under the leadership of the director general of BSD3, to work \nas counterparts of the consultants and ensure the successful implementation of the TA. CBRC \nwill provide necessary office space, counterpart staff, and other facilities to the consultants and \nwill arrange appointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations. \n \n18.  The TA will engage international consultants for a total of 6 person-months: (i) one risk-\nbased banking supervision specialist and team leader (3.5 person-months) who has practical \nexperience with on-site inspections and supervisory rating systems and in-depth knowledge of \nbanks\u2019  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems;  and  (ii)  one  cross-border banking \n                                                 \n10  e.g., The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 1998.
