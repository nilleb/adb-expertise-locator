During the Country Programming Mission in June 2007, the Government of Bhutan \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA)1 to boost its efforts, \nbegun under the Bhutan Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP),2 to establish and \noperate a credit information bureau (CIB). The request was in line with the Government\u2019s \nobjective of developing the country\u2019s financial sector to promote private sector investment and \ndevelopment. The TA was later included in the Bhutan Country Operations Business Plan \n2008\u20132010.3 ADB conducted a fact-finding mission in February 2008 and reached agreement \nwith the Government on the overall TA objective, outputs, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The financial sector is becoming increasingly important as Bhutan moves away from \nsubsistence farming and toward a market economy. The private sector, the engine of economic \ngrowth, requires an investment environment and suitable financial services that are conducive \nto meeting the needs of diverse entrepreneurs. However, a lack of timely and reliable borrower \ninformation is contributing to the buildup of nonperforming loans and the subsequent adoption of \nvery stringent collateral requirements, making credit virtually inaccessible to the private sector.  \nPrivate investment must be supported by a sound, stable, and well-functioning financial system; \nhence,  the  health  and  development  of  the  financial  sector  depends  on  a  reliable  credit \ninformation system with a database of borrowers for storing, retrieving, and sharing credit \ninformation among lending institutions and even across borders. A CIB with such a system and \nadequate staffing in place will improve credit risk assessment and the efficiency of lending and \ninvestment.  \n3.  The  FSDP  foresaw  the  need  to  establish  a  CIB  for  credit  information  sharing  and \nfinancial sector development, and set forth relevant policy actions to achieve this objective. The \nestablishment of the CIB was to be achieved in three stages, as follows: (i) setting up a CIB unit \nat the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) to develop a road map, conduct a feasibility study, and \nselect software for the CIB system; (ii) establishing the CIB and drafting and issuing the legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  framework  needed  to  collect  and  circulate  credit  data;  and \n(iii) making the CIB operational. The FSDP also provided for the participation of an international \nlegal expert (2 person-months) to see to it that an adequate legal and regulatory framework for \nsecure credit information disclosure and sharing was in place.4\n4.  A study tour to neighboring countries, including India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, was \norganized by the Government in 2004 to review the credit information systems and institutional \nsetup  in  the  region  and  select  a  suitable  CIB  model  for  Bhutan.  From  its  findings,  the \nGovernment decided to purchase the credit information software that Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) \nhad designed and delivered with considerable success for CIB systems in South Asia and \nelsewhere. In 2006, the Government also hired D&B to study the feasibility of establishing a CIB \nin Bhutan. The feasibility study recommended the establishment of a CIB first as a division of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 March 2008. \n2  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  for  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila  (Loans  2279/2280-BHU \napproved on 7 December). \n3  ADB. 2007. Bhutan: Country Operations Business Plan 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n4  A total of $98,000 has been set aside for the legal advisory services and also for the acquisition of Web servers.  \n ", "2 \nRMA, which would share its costs with five financial institutions (FIs)5 for financial sustainability. \nThen, once an adequate legal framework was installed,6 the CIB would become fully functional, \nand the FIs could avail themselves of its products and services. Eventually the CIB would \nbecome  an  independent  entity. 7   The  feasibility  study  also  recommended  a  suitable \nmanagement  and  ownership  structure  for  the  CIB,  and  an  appropriate  technological  and \nphysical platform, including software and hardware, given the CIB\u2019s assessed needs, system \nrequirements, and global and regional trends in credit information development. The goal, as \nthe study pointed out, was to facilitate financial transactions through more informed credit \ndecisions, and to give individuals and companies easier access to credit at reasonable cost.  \n5.  The feasibility study identified two essential areas where additional TA was needed. One \nwas the procurement of a complete technology solution for the technological infrastructure, \ncustomized to suit the information technology (IT) environment in Bhutan and the special needs \nof the CIB, that would support and link the CIB with all FIs in a network for data transmission, \nstorage, and retrieval. This requirement was beyond the original scope of the FSDP. The other \nessential area identified in the feasibility study was the building of FI and CIB staff capacity to \nimplement the IT system and to manage day-to-day operations while maintaining high operating \nstandards. Therefore, at the request of the Government, a TA is now proposed to provide the \nadditional support needed to set up the CIB.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA is expected to bring about a more efficient and sound banking system in Bhutan \nby improving credit decisions, lending practices, and borrowers\u2019 access to credit. The TA should \nalso  help  mitigate  risk,  lower  the  costs  of  financial  transactions  for  FIs,  and  increase  the \nefficiency of the financial sector overall, consistent with the FSDP objective. \n7.  The outcome will be enhanced access to transparent and reliable credit information and, \nhence, better-quality credit decisions and bank lending practices. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will adopt two methodologies. First, it will ensure the procurement of adequate \ntechnological  infrastructure  for  a  well-functioning  credit  information  system.  Second,  it  will \nprovide  relevant  training  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  CIB  staff  and,  where  necessary, \nconcerned staff in FIs in the techniques and day-to-day procedures that must be performed to \nmaintain high operating standards.  \n9.  There will be two key activities. The first is the procurement and installation of the credit \ninformation  software  from  D&B  and  appropriate  technological  and  physical  infrastructure \n(including software, hardware, and technology solution) to set up the data center. The system \nand infrastructure provider chosen will be responsible for (i) getting to know the data center \nrequirements; (ii) analyzing these requirements; (iii) procuring and implementing the system \nsoftware (for instance Windows, Linux, Oracle); (iv) designing, procuring, and implementing the \n                                                 \n5  The five financial institutions are the Bank of Bhutan, the Bhutan National Bank, the Bhutan Development Finance \nCorporation, the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan, and the National Pension and Provident Fund. \n6  The legal framework will be prepared under the Financial Sector Development Program (see para. 3). \n7  Given the assumptions and the projected revenues and costs, it will be at least 3 years (from the time of \nestablishment) before the CIB can become financially independent, according to the feasibility study.   \n ", "3 \nvarious data-center components (network, servers, uninterruptible power supply [UPS], and \nothers); (v) conducting user-acceptance testing of the finalized infrastructure and system; and \n(vi) providing relevant technical training for both CIB staff and the FI officers concerned, to \nensure the smooth operation of the customized system. \n10.  The second key activity of the TA is the capacity building of CIB staff for the proper \noperation and management of the CIB system. The training will emphasize practical experience \nand lessons learned from other well-established CIBs to heighten CIB sustainability, and will \nalso  look  forward  to  the  CIB\u2019s  eventual  independence  from  RMA  and  to  private  sector \nparticipation. Therefore, the capacity-building measures will involve three types of training: (i) a \n2-week secondment program and training in other well-established CIBs, such as those of India \nand Sri Lanka, to obtain on-the-job training and operational experience; (ii) structured training \ncourses in identified training institutes, in database, network, and data quality management, to \nenhance IT administration skills; and (iii) relevant training, including overseas secondment, in \nmanagement information systems (MIS) procedures, document formats and contents, user and \nproduct management, and business strategy, among others, to ensure the efficient functioning \nof  the  CIB  system.  The  trainees  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  qualifications  and \nresponsibilities, and must be committed to staying on in their present positions or work for at \nleast 2 years after the training.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $430,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $350,000 \nequivalent with a grant from its TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining \n$80,000, which will cover (i) the hiring of D&B to provide technical advice on the acquired \ntechnological  and  physical  infrastructure  and  ensure  system  compatibility  with  D&B\u2019s  CIB \nsoftware; and (ii) the provision of counterpart staff and office accommodation. Appendix 2 gives \nthe detailed cost estimates and financing plan.  \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency and RMA will be the Implementing \nAgency. To oversee the design, procurement, and implementation of the whole CIB system, \nincluding the managerial structure and technological solutions, a CIB unit has been formed at \nRMA as the first of three stages of CIB establishment planned under the FSDP. Further, to \nensure  compliance  of  all  government  procurement  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures,  a \nseparate procurement committee, co-chaired by the deputy managing director of RMA and the \ndirector of the program/project management unit of the FSDP, has also been formed.  \n13.  Two  procurement  methods  will  be  followed  under  the  TA.  Direct  contracting \n(single-source selection) will be used in procuring the D&B software for the collection of credit \ninformation data. Direct contracting is deemed appropriate for this purpose for the following \nreasons:  (i)  D&B\u2019s  software  is  considered  most  appropriate  for  Bhutan,  and  most  of  the \ncountry\u2019s neighbors in South Asia, such as India and Sri Lanka, use the same credit software \nand  are  satisfied  with  the  outcome;8  (ii)  D&B  has  very  relevant  and  exceptional  project \n                                                 \n8  After the study tour in 2004, the adoption of a CIB model similar to those in India and Sri Lanka, which have a \nsimilar development background, was recommended.   \n ", "4 \nexperience in establishing CIBs and in providing technical advice all over the world, including \nSouth Asia;9 and (iii) the software is proprietary and obtainable from only one source.  \n14.  International competitive bidding through a single-stage, two-envelope procedure will be \nused in procuring the customized technological, network, and physical infrastructure to support \nthe D&B software. As the feasibility study suggested,10 a turnkey contract will be drawn up for \nthe supply of the following: a local area network; a data center; required hardware and software \n(including third-party software such as Windows, Linux, and Oracle); technology solutions for \nsecure connectivity; required consultancy for the installation, implementation, and testing of the \ncomplete IT platform; and technical support and training. The bids will be evaluated on the basis \nof performance. All goods and services under the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (February 2007, as amended from time to time). All equipment and \nsoftware procured under the TA will be transferred to the Government after the TA. \n15.  Regarding the required capacity-building measures, the 2-week secondment program \nand structured training courses in data management will be provided directly by the identified \nCIBs and training institutes in India and Sri Lanka, which have the most relevant expertise and \nexperience with the particular CIB model chosen by the Government of Bhutan. On the other \nhand, the relevant MIS and advanced management training (including overseas secondment \nprograms)  to  enhance  CIB  management  and  sustainability  will  require  highly  specialized \nexpertise and depth of experience. Single-source selection will therefore be used in hiring an \ninternational CIB management specialist through D&B to provide intermittent assistance for a \ntotal of 0.75 person-month\u2014first, in setting up and providing relevant training for the required \nMIS, and then in designing and planning the advanced management training and overseas \nsecondment programs. This same specialist will also assist in implementing the secondment \nprograms and in ensuring the conduct of the advanced management training in the identified \nCIBs. Single-source selection is warranted in this instance because (i) the task represents a \nnatural continuation of the advisory work of D&B, which has had exceptional experience in \nsetting up the business models for CIBs in the South Asian region; and (ii) such a small and \nshort-term assignment does not justify the preparation and evaluation of a competitive proposal. \nThe consultant will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time) and a lump-sum contract will be prepared for the assignment. \nDetailed terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n16.  The  reporting  requirements  for  the  procurement  of  equipment  and  technological \ninfrastructure will be built into the contract on the basis of the provider\u2019s proposed installation \nplan. Because the term of assignment of the CIB management specialist will be short, a draft \nfinal report with the required output indicated in Appendix 3 will be submitted to the Government \nand ADB for comments 1 week before the completion of the TA, and the final version of the \nreport incorporating the comments will be submitted at the end of the TA. Tripartite meetings will \nbe held to discuss the progress and attend to issues that arise during the TA implementation. \nThe TA will be implemented from June 2008 to July 2009.  \n                                                 \n9  D&B has abundant project experience in deploying CIB platforms in the South Asian region including Bangladesh, \nIndia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. \n10 The feasibility study (2006) also includes recommendations on the initial management and ownership, staff \nrecruitment, core businesses, marketing strategy, potential data sources, and technology requirements (such as \nsystem architecture, local area network and communication requirements, data extracting and submitting system, \ndisaster recovery, etc.) The request for proposals will be designed based on the technical specifications as \nindicated in the feasibility study (2006).  \n ", "5 \nIV.
