The proposed Strengthening Social Resilience Program aims to support the Government \nof Bangladesh in strengthening the social resilience of its people. It is consistent with the country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Bangladesh, which \nprioritizes investments in human capital through social protection programs and improved rural \nlivelihoods;1 and with ADB's Strategy 2030 and the operational priorities on addressing remaining \npoverty, accelerating progress in gender equality, and strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.2 The proposed programmatic approach, consisting of two subprograms, is proposed to \ndesign and support sequenced policy packages to enhance inclusive and responsive social \ndevelopment in Bangladesh. \n  \n2.  The program\u2019s impact will be strengthened social resilience of Bangladesh's people. The \noutcome will be improved inclusiveness and responsiveness of social development. The program \nhas three reform areas: (i) coverage and efficiency of social protection improved, (ii) financial \ninclusion of disadvantaged people improved, and (iii) response to life cycle social and health \nneeds strengthened. The overall program is estimated to cost $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Bangladesh has made great strides in poverty relief, halving its poverty incidence from \n48.9% in 2000 to 20.5% in 2019.3 But while many people have lifted from chronic poverty, a \nsubstantial number still live in vulnerable conditions. These people are sustaining their lives by \nday work and are highly vulnerable to shocks such as major illnesses and external events. The \n2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) indicated that in addition to the highly \npoor segment, 18.6% of the population still remained vulnerable.4  \n \n4.  Urbanization  and  demographic  changes  have  further  altered  the  social  profile  in \nBangladesh. The share of the urban population has doubled from just 20% in 1990 to nearly 40% \nin 2019. Poverty declined in both urban and rural areas, but the decline was greater in rural areas. \nThe number of rural poor fell from 52 million in 1995 to less than 38 million by 2016, while \nurbanization kept the number of urban poor at about 12 million.5 The share of elderly people (aged \n60 and over) is estimated to increase from 7.1% in 2015 to 9.6% by 2025, and to reach 22.0% by \n2050.6 This has critical implications on the needs of elderly people for social protection since \nBangladesh has not yet established a comprehensive pension system. The 2016 HIES indicated \nthat almost 50% of the elderly population were in a poor or vulnerable status. The poverty profile \nis more diversified in Bangladesh, and vulnerability is a key development challenge. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020. Manila.

Dhaka. \n4  Bangladesh defines vulnerable population as having an income above the national poverty line but below a level of \n25% more, i.e. below 1.25 times the national poverty line.  \n5  While the urban poverty rate declined in relative terms because of the increase in the total urban population, the \nabsolute number of urban poor remained fairly constant. \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2020. Midterm Progress Review \non the National Social Security Strategy. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \n5.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic had a large impact on Bangladesh's \nsocioeconomic situation. The economy took a particularly sharp turn in April\u2013May 2020 when \ninternational trade and remittances declined substantially. Unemployment surged to 22.4% during \nApril\u2013July 2020, from 2.1% in March 2020.7 Those hit hardest by the pandemic were the poor and \nvulnerable people, who faced further impoverishment or fell back into poverty.  \n \n6.  To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the government introduced stimulus packages in \nMarch 2020, including financial support for health workers and for employment-generation. In late \n2020, international trade and remittances began to recover, and the unemployment rate declined \nto 3.8% in September 2020. However, as the uncertainty of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic \nremains, it is imperative for Bangladesh to continue its social protection agenda to further mitigate \nthe impacts of the pandemic, particularly on the poor and vulnerable people, and to maintain the \nefforts toward sustainable development.  \n \n7.  Social  protection  development.  The  early  development  on  social  protection  in \nBangladesh focused mainly on post-disaster relief to support affected people. Food security \nprograms also began early on, targeting the extreme poor in rural areas and seasonal poverty \nduring lean agricultural periods. However, many safety net programs were launched ad hoc to \nmeet the needs of the moment. This led to the creation of more than 100 programs involving \nmultiple  implementation  ministries  and  agencies,  created  duplications,  and  undermined  the \nefficiency  of  the  social  protection  system.  Moreover,  the  gap  between  social  needs  and \ngovernment response began to widen because the current social protection system does not take \ninto account the diversified needs of a rapidly urbanizing country and the associated risks across \ndifferent stages of life. \n \n8.  Development constraints. The government recognized these challenges and formulated \nthe National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) in 2015 to improve social inclusiveness and respond \nmore efficiently to the changing social needs by streamlining and strengthening the social \nprotection  system.8 The  NSSS  serves  as  the  government\u2019s  overall  framework  for  social \ndevelopment and presents its long-term vision of building an inclusive social protection system to \nprevent poverty and inequality and contribute to broader human development. It also defines the \nmedium-term  reform  targets  of  making  more  efficient  use  of  social  protection  resources, \nstrengthening the delivery of social protection benefits, and moving toward a more inclusive form \nof protection that meets diversified needs. To attain the reform targets, the NSSS presents two \nareas: program reform and institutional reform. The program reform has four main agendas: (i) \nimproving the coverage and quality of key social protection programs, including programs for \nchildren,  working-age  people,  vulnerable  women,  and  elderly  people;  (ii)  extending  social \nprotection into new areas (e.g., protection for people with disabilities and the urban poor); \n(iii) establishing a national social insurance scheme (NSIS); and (iv) consolidating the main social \nprotection programs. The institutional reform aims to (i) strengthen cross-ministerial coordination, \n(ii) develop an integrated administration system across programs, (iii) improve financial inclusion \nby extending the government to person payment system, (iv) strengthen the grievance redress \nmechanism, and (v) establish results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E). \n  \n9.  The NSSS also highlights the key issues of social safety net programs: (i) inadequate \ncoverage and benefits, (ii) fragmentation because of too many small programs, and (iii) narrow \n \n7  The government conducted a quick survey of households in September 2020 by calling 2,040 mobile phone numbers \ndrawn from random sampling (Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2020.

In addition, it views the development of advanced financial and digital \ntechnologies  as  key  to  attaining  the  financial  inclusion  of  disadvantaged  people  and  to \nstrengthening  social  resilience  in  Bangladesh.  It  suggests  a  conceptual  change  in  social \nprotection from the current fragmentation to a system based on a lifecycle approach. The life cycle \napproach aims to address causes of poverty at different stages of life, from birth to old age. For \nexample, it covers maternal support to reduce the economic risks associated with pregnancy and \nearly childhood, and support for the elderly to mitigate the risks associated with old age and \ndisabilities. The current social protection scope in Bangladesh is too narrow to meet the varying \nsocial and health needs of a life cycle. The proposed program will assist the government in \nimproving  the  (i)  coverage  and  efficiency  of  social  protection,  (ii)  financial  inclusion  of \ndisadvantaged people, and (iii) response to life cycle social and health needs.  \n \n10.  To ensure that the impacts of the proposed program are sustainable, the government\u2019s \ncontinued efforts and commitment are necessary. The program is not only to improve the existing \nsocial protection programs but also to reform the system by broadening the scope of social \nprotection  and  including  cross-sector  considerations.  Therefore,  the  attached  transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) will help conduct evidence-based M&E of the reforms\u2019 implementation, \nand technical and policy analyses of associated issues. The TA will also be instrumental in \npreparing the ground for piloting an NSIS to mitigate the risks of falling into poverty.9 It will help \nstrengthen the awareness and knowledge of policymakers and the public of the key aspects of \ninclusive and responsive social development. The aim is to improve people's basic technical, \nfinancial, and digital literacy to build a firm consensus on the reforms among all stakeholders.    \n \n11.  The proposed TA is included in the country operations business plan for Bangladesh \n2021\u20132023.10 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Monitoring and evaluation of the reforms supported. The TA will develop \nframeworks for evidence-based M&E in the core reform areas, in line with the proposed program: \n(i) social protection, including coverage, management and administration through management \ninformation systems, consolidation of social protection programs, and a national social insurance \nscheme;  (ii)  financial  inclusion;  and  (iii)  health  preparedness  and  response.  Based  on  the \nframeworks, the progress of activities under each policy action will be monitored and achievements \nwill  be  evaluated.  It  will  also  prepare  progress  reports  in the  core reform  areas  and make \nrecommendations for a sustainable and effective M&E system.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Capacity for developing policies on sustainable social inclusiveness and \nresponsiveness strengthened. To further support the sustainability of reform impacts, the TA will \nhelp improve the capacity of ministries and agencies for further policy development in the core \nreform areas. Under output 2, the TA will conduct technical and policy analyses of (i) the social \nprotection system, (ii) urban health care, and (iii) financial inclusion. Under (i), it will provide technical \nsupport to the relevant line ministries for the preparation of their respective program consolidation \nframework and planning. It will also provide technical advice on (i) social protection for urban \npopulations, (ii) an integrated social protection registry using management information systems, \nand (iii) the NSIS. In line with the National Urban Health Strategy, the TA will provide technical \n \n9  The current social protection system in Bangladesh focuses on social assistance in the form of poverty relief but has \nlimited capacity for preventing poverty.
