THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan and (ii) proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic, for subprogram 2 of the \nPromoting  Economic  Diversification  Program  (PEDP),  and  (iii)  the  inclusion  of  proposed \nsubprogram 3 in the programmatic approach. \n \n2.  The  program  continues  to  support  the  implementation  of  reforms  in  the  National \nDevelopment Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018\u20132040 (NDS 2040) and its overarching \nobjective of gradually diversifying the Kyrgyz economy away from an over-reliance on gold \nproduction  and  exports  (about  6%\u201310%  of  gross  domestic  product  [GDP]  each  year)  and \nremittance-led consumption (about 30% of GDP).1 The program is a milestone in the NDS 2040 \nconnecting past reform support  from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Government of \nKyrgyz Republic on trade and investment competitiveness, small and medium-sized enterprise \n(SME) development, infrastructure development (including through public\u2013private partnerships \n[PPPs]), and industry-based skills development. The Kyrgyz Republic is recovering from the \nimpact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak that began in March 2020, \nwhich has led to severe economic and employment contraction and fiscal difficulties. This \nprogram has been enhanced to support the government stay on the reform course in spite of \nthese challenges, by (i) insulating the originally planned and needed medium-term reform efforts \nfrom  the  crisis  effects,  (ii)  while  adding  urgent  reforms  to  improve  the  governance,  fiscal \nmanagement (and buffers) and social protection mechanisms that have now been agreed to be \ncrucial enablers of the original medium-term reform agenda.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development constraints.3 The current crisis in the Kyrgyz Republic is the worst since \nthe fall of the Soviet Union (para. 4) but it is also just one more of a long series of frequent \neconomic recession episodes that have conflated hardship-inducing external shocks, serious \nsocial  and  political  instability,  and  disruptions  to  medium-term  reform  and  institutional \ndevelopment plans.4 This boom-bust pattern explains the lack of income per capita convergence \nof the country with advanced economies in the last few decades. Even though it is urgent for \neconomic policy to focus on stabilizing the current COVID-19 related health, macroeconomic, and \nsocial crises, the government also recognizes that keeping on track efforts to diversify its economy \nmust remain its crucial reform priority. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s lack of economic diversification \nremains both (i) at the core of its significant structural vulnerability to external shocks, including \nan overreliance on commodities sales and migrant labor remittance, and which the lack of fiscal \nbuffers and effective social protection systems exacerbates (including a lack of women\u2019s access \nto social protection, employment, and finance); and (ii) a drag on medium-term economic growth \nand debt sustainability. Addressing some of its key binding constraints has been a focus of ADB\u2019s \n \n1  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018. National Development Strategy: 2018\u20132040.

In the last two decades, the Kyrgyz economy \nrecorded recessionary episodes in 2002, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2018 and 2020. \n ", "2 \nsupport  since  2007.5 There  has  been  incremental  progress  and  important  lessons  from \nexperience for the design of the proposed programmatic assistance. But major binding constraints \nremain:  \n(i)  Weak trade and investment competitiveness. Exports are concentrated on a few products \n(mainly precious metals and mineral commodities and three major markets [Kazakhstan, the \nRussian Federation, and Switzerland]). This is not only a symptom of the underlying lack of \nproduct diversification and weak business environment, it also constitutes a drag on future \ngrowth and export potential.6 Several agricultural products have considerable export potential, \nbut lack the enabling policy and institutional support that could help diversify and expand \nexport penetration, reduce transaction costs associated with customs, and improve farmer \nknowledge about disease prevention, control, and other required non-price competitiveness \nenablers.7 Women represent 44% of the total agricultural workforce, and play an important \nrole in agri-food value chains. In addition, despite a relatively open foreign direct investment \n(FDI) regime, the sources of FDI inflows remain dependent on a few sources  and focused on \nvery few sectors (mineral processing, and finance and insurance). This eliminates a crucial \navenue for knowledge and technology transfer from abroad to the Kyrgyz economy. Reforms \nare also needed to (i) improve the policy, legal, and institutional environment for trade and \ninvestment  and  reflect  ongoing  Government  commitment  to  improving  public  sector \ngovernance; (ii) strengthen the capacity of small businesses to comply with international \nmarket access requirements; and (iii) improve exporter access to market intelligence.8  \n(ii) Limited small and medium-sized enterprise development. The SME share of employment \nand GDP are low by regional standards.9 Although formal credit to SMEs has been rising \nsteadily since 2009, banks continue to treat SMEs as high risk-high transaction cost ventures. \nCollateral requirements can reach between 120%\u2013200% of the total loan amount, making it \nalmost impossible for SMEs to leverage debt to grow their businesses, with greater gender-\ndifferentiated effect on women.10 Most SMEs lack the knowledge, skills and experience to tap \ninto export markets, and graduate into higher value-added activities as businesses mature.11  \nSMEs, particularly those in tourism and hospitality, but also small manufacturing, construction, \ntransport  and  trade  sectors,  have  been  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  current  crisis,  as \nconsumer demand has plummeted and economic activity has decreased by 80%. Due to their \nconcentration in these sectors and high incidence of informality, women-headed enterprises, \nrepresenting over 50% of firms in tourism, hospitality and trade,  were disproportionally \naffected. In terms of social ramifications, there is evidence of rising gender-based violence \n \n5  ADB. Kyrgyz Republic: Vocational Education and Skills Development Project; ADB.

The available limited data on \nnumber of bank borrowers indicates that women make between 9%\u201330% of bank borrowers.

The quality of infrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic is \namong the lowest in the world\u2014the country ranks 107 out of 140 countries with regard to \noverall  infrastructure  quality. 13  Absent  or  poorly  maintained  infrastructure  significantly \nincreases business costs for air and road transportation and energy, which affects cost \ncompetitiveness in energy and transport-intensive sectors. Similar challenges also effect \nsocial  sector  infrastructure. 14  Public  investment  through  the  three-year  rolling  Public \nInvestment Program has traditionally addressed infrastructure development needs in the \ncountry, however, needs have outpaced current levels of investment. Public infrastructure \ninvestment  is  characterized  by  weak  infrastructure  governance  encompassing  weak \ninstitutional capacity for project preparation, contract management, financial forecasting and \nbudgeting, and monitoring and evaluation.15 PPPs can be a very efficient procurement avenue \nto  address  infrastructure  development  needs  in  the  country.  With  ADB  support,  the \ngovernment  has made significant  progress  in developing  an  enabling  policy,  legal  and \ninstitutional framework for PPPs. In 2018, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the Kyrgyz \nRepublic 9th out of 19 Asian countries for level of PPP readiness,16 but it also noted slow \nimplementation of PPP projects. The main constraints to effective implementation of PPP \nprojects  are:  (i)  limited  PPP  understanding,  sensitization  and  awareness  within  sector \nministries; (ii) ineffective gateway review processes within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to \nensure fiscally-responsible PPPs; and (iii) limited access to non-recourse finance for viable \nPPP projects. \n(iv) Weak links between skills development and industry needs. The labor market of the \nKyrgyz Republic is characterized by skilled workers and technicians from the Soviet era who \nare approaching retirement. The current technical and vocational education (TVET) system is \nnot able to meet the labor force replacement rate, which is up to five times higher than the \nnumber of skilled workers entering the workforce.17 The government recognizes that workers \nwho are unprepared for the changing skills requirements are less likely to find employment \nand more likely to be in volatile low wage jobs. In the absence of a national qualifications \nsystem and framework, unstructured TVET system variations have sprung up. Innovative \nTVET finance reforms such as the introduction of per capita financing (PCF) and incentive \nfunds to improve administration and operations, are needed to accompany the increased use \nof TVET to modernize the labor force.18 This lack of policy framework has resulted in (i) \ninsufficient support for employment generation, (ii) migration-led and remittance dependency, \nand (iii) large shares of low-productivity agricultural employment. There is also a strong gender \ndivide  in  vocational  education,  with  less  than  10%  female  students  in  engineering, \n \n12 During January\u2013March 2020, for example, the number of reported domestic violence cases rose by 65% compared \nwith same period in 2019.

In addition, \nimproved access to childcare leads to increased labor force participation of women. \n15 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

Technical and Vocational Education and Training\u2014System Rationalization: Strategies and \nImplementation Plans. TVET in the Kyrgyz Republic comprises of two levels: primary vocational education (PVE) \nand secondary vocational education.  \n18 PCF is a new form of education finance that is considered international good practice. Funding is based on student \nnumbers rather than the continuation of lump-sum projections (largely based on historic budgeting). \n ", "4 \nconstruction and agriculture subjects.19 Gender segregation in education has effects on the \nlabor market, where women dominate in often lower-paid sectors. For example, in 2019, the \ngender pay gap\u2014the average difference in earnings between men and women\u2014was 23%.20  \n(v) Weak fiscal management and social protection system coverage and targeting. The lack \nof fiscal buffers and effective social protection systems exacerbates the vulnerability of the \nKyrgyz  Republic  to  external  shocks,  including  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  could  be \nattributed to the inherent fiscal procyclicality and liquidity-constrained consumer behavior \nresponses that amplify the shocks through the economy. This procyclicality in both public and \nprivate expenditure in crises does not only increase permanent impact on potential growth in \ngeneral (through, for example, the destruction of franchise value in the private sector that \nbankruptcies create or asset quality hangover effects in the financial system),21 but it has also \nvery often brought social instability in the Kyrgyz Republic and political upheaval. Sustained \nreform efforts and institutional development planning over the last few decades in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic have often fallen prey to the frequent political transitions that external shocks result \nin.  Establishing  social  protection  systems  to  become  more  shock-responsive  and \ncountercyclical has been a key strategic mechanism in successful  development cases. \nBesides creating political constituencies for reform, such social protection mechanisms help \ncountries navigate through increased trade openness and its adjustment shocks.22 The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has illustrated again the perils that the Kyrgyz Republic faces in this \nparticular regard. The socio-economic risk to households has been heightened due to low \ncoverage and the inadequacy of its existing social protection transfers.23 It is also crucial to \nestablish fiscal buffers and debt management options to help address liquidity issues in the \nimmediate aftermath of crises. Methodologies to ensure fiscal oversight of PPPs and ensure \nthey are fiscally responsible, as well as fiscal rules to help regain fiscal space and improve \npublic debt sustainability in the medium-term, are central as well as improving targeting \nmechanisms to maximize impact and minimize costs of social protection.24   \n \n4.  Macroeconomic  impact  of  COVID-19  Crisis.  Immediately  prior  to  the  crisis,  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  assessed  the  Kyrgyz  economy  and  concluded  that \nmacroeconomic and financial sector performance in 2019 was broadly sound. Real GDP growth \nhad increased to 4.6% in 2019 due to a pickup of both gold and non-gold output. The budget \ndeficit had decreased to 0.1% of GDP in 2019, and, as a result, public debt decreased to 51.6% \nof GDP.25 But the widespread loss of income and jobs and increase in poverty and income \ninequality resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic crisis knocked the Kyrgyz economy off from its \ntrajectory. While the government\u2019s immediate priority has been to minimize the spread of the \ncontagion, responding to its socio-economic consequences has become crucial. The economy \ncontracted by 8.6% in 2020, the worst recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the \n \n19 Representation of women among vocational managers and technical subject teachers is about 25%. \n20 National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2019.

Remittances declined by 25% in early 2020, reflecting the large number of returning \nmigrant workers (mainly from Russian Federation) and the depreciation of the Russian ruble. The \nfiscal deficit widened to around 3.3% of GDP in 2020 with tax revenues declining by 2.1% of \nGDP.26 \n \n5.  Growth is expected to rebound in 2021\u20132022, but uncertainty remains high. Barring a \nresurgence of the pandemic, the economy is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2021 and by 6.4% in \n2022, underpinned by the more favorable global outlook, recovery of domestic activity, higher \ngold production, and a gradual rebound in tourism, transportation and related services. A budget \ndeficit of 4.2% of GDP is projected for 2021 (Table 1) subject to the availability of financing. This \ndeficit will reduce public debt by about 1.0% of GDP, while maintaining the fiscal stimulus. The \nbudget  reflects  a  cyclical  recovery  in  tax  revenue  and  the  observed  improvement  in  tax \ncompliance, a moderate decline in the public sector wage bill, and higher spending on goods and \nservices and investment. However, if sufficient financing cannot be mobilized, further cuts to non-\npriority expenditure will be needed (for example, goods and services, subsidies and lower priority \ninvestment) while preserving health and social spending.27 The government plans to bring the \ndeficit below 3.0% of GDP and cap public debt at 60% of GDP by 2025, in line with the Main \nDirections of Fiscal Policy for 2020\u20132023, the government\u2019s main fiscal policy statement, and the \nIMF\u2019s policy advice.28 \n \nTable 1: Selected Macro-Fiscal Aggregates, 2018\u20132021 (as of 28 February 2021) \nItem  2018  2019  2020 (e)  2020  2021 (f) \n(rev.)a \nReal GDP (% change)  3.5  4.6  3.4  -8.6  3.8 \nInflation (% change, 12-month ave.)  1.5  1.1  4.9  6.3  9.4 \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP)  32.5  32.4  32.5  31.0  31.1 \nTax revenues  20.2  19.6  21.8  17.5  18.9 \nTotal expenditure and net lending (% of  33.1  32.5  30.9  34.3  35.3 \nGDP) \nOverall balance (% of GDP)  -0.6  -0.1  -1.6  -3.3  -4.2 \nTotal public debt (% of GDP)  54.8  51.6  55.5  68.0  67.1 \nExternal debt  47.0  43.3  46.7  58.3  56.8 \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  -12.1  -12.1  -7.7  4.5  -5.8 \nNominal GDP ($ million)  8,271  8,872  8,781  7,747  8,027 \ne = estimate, f = forecast, GDP = gross domestic product, rev = revised. \na  Pre-budget support from IMF, ADB, Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development and EU. \nSources: Government of Kyrgyz Republic and IMF staff estimates. \n \n6.  Impact  of  COVID-19  Crisis  on  government  reform  agenda.  The  government  is \nmaintaining its committed course and continues to implement reforms with development partner \nsupport. However, the fiscal and social emergencies that became the focus of the Ministries of \nAgriculture, Economy, Education and Science, Finance, and Labor and Social Development had \nnegative consequences on the general reform momentum of early-2020. The normal functioning \nof government institutions could not be maintained for large periods of time due to quarantines. \nPublic sector bureaucracies\u2019 capacity to keep the most fundamental levels of public services and \npublic policy at work was challenged for most of 2020. It was not only the specific policy dialogue \nand technical assistance (TA) to reform activities that slowed, but also the inter-ministerial and \n \n26 The deficit was reduced to 3.3% of GDP through general grant budget support from IMF ($242 million), ADB ($50 \nmillion through the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program), the Eurasian Fund for \nStabilization and Development ($100 million), and the EU ($34 million). \n27 IMF. 2021.

The reforms originally envisioned for \nsubprogram 2 were delayed. \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n7.  In addition to being developed on the basis of the NDS 2040, the proposed program is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  including  operational  priorities  on addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality and strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity,29 and with ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for 2018\u2013\n2022.30 The program has been prepared with ADB TA and support from the IMF on the policy \ndialogue with government on debt sustainability and on the preparation of fiscal management \nreforms.31 The  transition  to  a  dynamic,  globally  oriented,  market-based  economy  requires \nconsideration for a number of issues that the COVID-19 has illustrated as key: (i) importance of \nsocial safety nets to help cushion the impact of the pandemic and structural adjustment costs on \nthe populace, (ii) fiscal buffers to allow an immediate crises response and to create fiscal room to \nsafeguard public expenditures related to the reform effort (paras. 10\u201318), and (iii) constituency \nbuilding through policy measures to safeguard public expenditure on social protection while \naddressing the low coverage and inadequacy of the existing safety net. ADB\u2019s programmatic \nassistance helps incorporate this emerging consensus. \n \n8.  The programmatic approach. In September 2019, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved \nthe programmatic approach and a $50 million grant for subprogram 1.32 Through 12 policy \nactions, subprogram 1 helped the government to build the foundation for policy and institutional \nreforms  in  agriculture,  trade  and  investment  competitiveness,  SME  development,  PPP \ndevelopment and industry-linked skills development. The program was originally designed with \ntwo subprograms. Subprogram 2\u2019s originally expected implementation was August 2019\u2013July \n2021.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  crisis  fundamentally  disrupted  reform  timelines  and  the \nimplementation of the reform preparatory activities under subprogram 2 (para. 6). This was more \nprevalent in reform areas 1 and 2, and less of a factor in reform areas 3 and 4. But, overall, the \noriginal timeline for subprogram 2 implementation suffered, and besides a significant increase in \nthe fiscal needs and fiscal difficulties described in paras. 4\u20135, the crisis reality and the policy \ndialogue that ensued has produced a clear awareness for (i) urgent institutional development \nneeds to address emerging problems in the private sector (para. 7), (ii) the key complementary \nreform needs discussed in para. 3 v, and (iii) particular attention paid to reforms that extend the \neconomic diversification agenda but also reflect Government commitment to advancing specific \ngovernance reforms such as improving investor protection and making state-owned enterprises \nmore  transparent  and  accountable.  These  three  items  now  benefit  from  a  clear  policy \nacknowledgement of urgency from the government.  \n \n9.  Considering the importance of providing more space  to the Government  for reform \nimplementation given the complexity of reforms amidst an ongoing pandemic, introducing fiscal \nmanagement and social protection reforms (paras. 3\u20134 and 6) and to help Government meet its \n \n29 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "7 \nurgent financing needs in 2021 and 2022 (estimated at 4.2% of GDP [or around $337 million in \n2021] and 4.0% of GDP [or around $349 million] in 2022), the government requested financing \nfor subprogram 2 to be increased to $80 million (from $50 million originally planned).33 The \nprogram was also restructured to add a proposed subprogram 3 (amounting to $50 million and \nscheduled for Board approval in the third quarter of 2022) and a new reform area that is deemed \nto be a crucial enabler of the program\u2019s objectives (fiscal and social protection resilience improved \nto  enable  post-COVID-19  stabilization  and  recovery).  These  changes  meant  that  some \nrestructuring and re-sequencing of policy actions (17 in total) and sub-policy actions (19) from the \noriginal subprogram 2 were needed. Of this number, 7 actions were completed, 9 actions were \npushed back to subprogram 3, and 3 were merged to allow better focus.34 In addition, 8 new \nactions were added to strengthen the focus on agriculture and food security, and as part of the \nemerging agreement on fiscal management and social protection reforms. These changes remain \nfully aligned with the original program outcome, that is, increased broad-based economic growth, \nand the original logical framework for the program as outlined in the design and monitoring \nframework for subprogram 1. Overall, the proposed program builds on effective engagement in \nthe Development Partners Coordination Council (DPCC) comprising government and major \ndevelopment partners such as ADB, and the IMF.35 \n \n10.  Reform area 1: Trade and investment competitiveness to develop non-mineral \nsector and diversify exports and investments improved. The actions under this reform area \naim to promote the overall enabling environment for investment and export competitiveness and \nfood and agriculture, while addressing some of the scarring effects left by the COVID-19 crisis. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government adopted several reform measures to unlock production and \nsupply chains beginning with the Resolution of the \u201c8th Financing of Agriculture Program\u201d to \nprovide  preferential  credits  for  agricultural  producers to  accelerate  animal  husbandry,  crop \nproduction, processing of agricultural products, and implementation of spring farm work in 2020. \nThis will help change the focus of agricultural policy priorities towards increased agricultural \nproduction and food security.  All actions have been completed and verified. Under (indicative) \nsubprogram 3, Parliament will approve the Law \u201cOn Organic Agricultural Production\u201d to improve \nalignment  of  national  organic  certification  with  international  standards  and  improve \ncompetitiveness of organic product exports into the EU, Eurasian Economic Union and other \ninternational markets. In line with the Program for the Creation and Development of Trade and \nLogistics Centers for Agricultural Products in the Kyrgyz Republic for 2019\u20132023, the government \nwill (i) complete a feasibility study on the construction of a modern wholesale agricultural market, \nthe first such market in the country, and (ii) establish at least 2 trade and logistics centers for \nstorage, distribution and transportation of agricultural products. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) \nwill roll out the Registration of Export System (REX) for exporting to the EU within the framework \nof the Generalised System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) preferential market access program.36 \n \n33 ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n34 Further elaboration on the modified actions and additional actions taken by the government as compared to the \noriginal subprogram 2 indicative reforms is provided in Comparison of Original and Revised Reforms under \nSubprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 ADB, in particular, has been helping with reforms to improve the investment climate and competitiveness since 2008, \nbut it has also witnessed the negative effects of frequent political transitions on the continuity of reform efforts in \ngeneral. The analytical basis for this program is supplemented by the ADB\u2013United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) assessments of the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in the Kyrgyz Republic (footnote 12), findings from \nADB\u2019s previous and ongoing engagement, and various sector assessments. \n36 The REX will help increase exports to the EU and ensure improved uptake of the program by (i) registering at least \n80% of exporters to the EU market, (ii) adopting an Order of the Investment Promotion and Protection Agency (IPPA) \non REX system procedures, and (iii) training of IPPA staff to administer REX (with at least 40% women participants). \nThe government will approve and operationalize the Center for Halal Development under MOE (with at least 45% \n \n ", "8 \nFinally,  an  overarching  National  Investment  Strategy  for  2021\u20132025  will  be  adopted  and \nimplementation commenced through, amongst other things, the development of an investment \nincentives  package to attract  FDI  into  key  sectors  such  as  clothing and  textiles  and  food \nprocessing  and  targeted  geographical  locations  outside  Bishkek  and  Osh,  as  well  as  the \noperationalization of an investor grievance mechanism. \n \n11.  Reform area 2: Small and medium-sized enterprise development to broaden the \neconomic base and promote entrepreneurship improved. The actions under this reform area \naim to broaden the economic base and promote entrepreneurship and the participation of women \nin economic activities. While these actions will have critical medium- to long-term impact on job \ncreation, there was also some urgency to implement them to mitigate the adverse impact of the \nCOVID-19 crisis on job opportunities for the poor and vulnerable groups, including women. Under \nsubprogram 2, the government established its direct financing policy by executing the Som14 \nbillion \u201cFinancing of Business Entities Program\u201d in 2020 and provided a direct credit line to all \nSMEs (at least 30% of which were women-headed SMEs), increased risk pricing efficiency and \ntransparency in credit markets through the full operationalization of an integrated online credit \nhistory and scoring system for banks and financial institutions, and increased the use of non-\nproductive agricultural land for, inter alia, collateralization in external finance by submitting the \nGovernment Resolution \u201cOn the opinion of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic on the draft \nLaw of the Kyrgyz Republic On amendments to certain legislative acts of the Kyrgyz Republic on \ninvestment  support\"  to  Parliament.  The  National  Bank  of  Kyrgyz  Republic  (NBKR)  issued \nregulations for financial institutions to report on guarantees issued to SME\u2018s that are women-\nheaded. This measure will help stabilize collateral requirements, particularly where real estate is \nused (real estate is the main form of collateral in rural areas, is mainly owned by men and tends \nto fluctuate in value). The Board of the Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) Guarantee Fund \ndirected that 30% of the loans guaranteed be reserved for women-headed SMEs. To reduce \nbarriers to entry in markets and tax rules that give birth to rent-seeking and additional informal \ncosts to regulatory compliance, government (i) submitted the draft Law of the Kyrgyz Republic \n\u201cOn State Registration of Legal Entities,  Branches (Representative Offices)\u201d to Parliament, \nallowing submission of registration documents in electronic form and automation of legal entity \nregistration processes, and (ii) adopted the Resolution \u201cAmendments to some decisions of the \nGovernment of Kyrgyz Republic\u201d to ease and improve tax administration and reduce compliance \ncosts to the private sector, enabling consolidated reporting of income tax and social insurance \ncontributions. All actions have been completed and verified. \n \n12.  Under  (indicative)  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  execute  the  Som16  billion \n\u201cFinancing of Business Entities Program\u201d in 2021 to consolidate the policy direction initiated in \n2020 for direct financial support to SMEs (at least 35% of beneficiaries must be women-headed \nSMEs). Sustaining this program on an annual basis will send a strong signal of government \nsupport for SME development and entrepreneurship. To expand the range of affordable financial \nproducts to SMEs, the government will (i) introduce (with NBKR) warehouse receipt finance to \ne.g., enable farmers to use their stored produce as financial collateral, (ii) abolish tax reporting for \nsmall businesses (applying a simplified taxation system based on retail sales tax to reduce [formal \nand informal] compliance costs),37 and (iii) provide a digital platform to improve SME operations, \n \nfemale technical staff trained) with an annual budget allocation in 2021 in order to unlock opportunities for exporting \nto this $739.5 billion global market. \n37 These different forms of financial assistance will be complemented by Business Service Centers in Bishkek and Osh \n(staffing them with at least 40% women, and 30% of women at decision making positions) so that businesses are \nable to (i) obtain permits, licenses, and all other regulatory compliance documentation in one office, and (ii) have \naccess to business planning, skills and technical training, market information and financial resources. There will be \nperiodic reporting on services provided by the Business Centers, disaggregated by type, sex, sector and region. \n ", "9 \nand  expand  national  and  international  markets  by  submitting  a  draft  e-Commerce  Bill  to \nParliament for approval. \n \n13.  Reform  Area  3:  Public\u2013private  partnership  to  develop  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure improved. The actions under this reform area aim to develop critical social and \neconomic infrastructure through PPP investments in a fiscally-sustainable manner. This will in \nturn help reduce the costs of doing business and of delivering public services. Under subprogram \n2, the government (i) increased the budget allocation for the Center for Public\u2013Private Partnership \nfrom Som7.0 million in 2019 to Som11.1 million in 2020 to allow recruitment of PPP experts, this \nis crucial to establish key legal and financial expertise in Government, and in turn, allow the Centre \nto be more effective in the further development of PPPs; (ii) MOE submitted to Cabinet a draft \ndecree for a 5-year strategic framework for PPP development in Kyrgyz Republic called PPP \nDevelopment Program 2021\u20132026, which sets standards and principles for project development \nand support and to strengthen fiscal risk management; and (iii) in accordance with the Law of \nKyrgyz Republic \u201cOn Public\u2013Private Partnership\u201d, the Government approved (a) methodological \nguidelines for assessing fiscal exposure for direct and contingent liabilities of PPP agreements, \n(b) utilization of a fiscal exposure assessment tool that estimates direct and contingent liabilities \nfor awarded PPP agreements, (c) operational guidelines and model documents to develop \nfinancially viable PPP projects in accordance with international good practice; and (d) certified at \nleast 30 Government officials (of which at least 40% were women) in 2020 for Level 1 of the PPP \nCertification Program by APM Group (APMG) International as part of a comprehensive capacity \ndevelopment plan). All actions have been completed and verified. \n \n14.  Under (indicative) subprogram 3, the government will (i) increase the Center\u2019s budget from \nSom11.1 million in 2020 to Som14.8 million in 2021, and (ii) ensure certification of another 20 \nGovernment officials (with at least 40% female officials trained) in the APMG International PPP \nCertification  Program  in  order  to  ensure  continued  build-up  of  expertise  and  effective \nimplementation of the government\u2019s PPP agenda. This action is continued in the post-program \nengagement  framework  (PPEF).  In  line  with  the  PPP  Development  Program  2021\u20132026, \nGovernment  will  implement  the  Financial  Support  Framework  for  PPPs  commencing  with \nsubmission to Parliament of (i) amendments and regulations to the Law of Kyrgyz Republic \u201cOn \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership\u201d to identify, approve and monitor all contingent liabilities arising from \nany PPP agreement irrespective of the value of the PPP project; (ii) regulations to provide for \nadequate budget allocation to meet any direct or contingent liabilities should they materialize \nthrough the establishment of a Guarantee Fund or any other mechanism that meets the purpose \nof budgeting for direct and contingent liabilities arising from PPP; and (iii) annual reports on the \naggregated amount of fiscal spending and future commitments in terms of direct and contingent \nliabilities arising from all awarded PPP agreements and the related value for money.38  \n \n15.  Reform  area  4:  Industry-linked  skills  development  through  enhanced  internal \nefficiency and qualifications structure improved. The actions under this reform area aim to \nimprove the quality, funding and relevance of TVET by modernizing the curricula and teaching \nand learning materials, improving quality assurance mechanisms, strengthening cooperation with \nindustry, and ensuring adequate TVET financing. Under subprogram 2, in order to complete the \ntransition from historical lump-sum budget allocations to annual performance-based budget \nallocations and ensure better alignment between the TVET curricula and the needs of the labor \nmarket,  the  government  (i)  piloted  PCF  in  8  national  Centers  of  Excellence  in  secondary \n \n38 The government will allocate Som254 million through the Project Development Support Fund to at least 7 PPP \nprojects, and will award at least 4 PPP contracts that have been appraised and structured in line with international \nstandards. \n ", "10 \nvocational education institutions (SVET); (ii) approved the methodology for Sectoral Qualifications \nFrameworks (SQF), which will match the TVET curricula with sector-and industry-needs; and (iii) \napproved an Action Plan for a National Qualifications System (NQS). In addition, the Ministry of \nEducation and Science (MOES) legally established and made operational 4 model centers (MCs) \nin the form of independent entities with 20% of teacher and staff positions filled by women and \nissued a Ministerial Order to legally establish 8 additional MCs (7 outside Bishkek) with 20% of \nfemale teachers and staff, and at least 30% of women in decision making positions in MCs. To \npromote pre-employment training and on-the-job upskilling, the government established a Skills \nDevelopment Fund (SDF) with an agreed budget allocation of $250,000 for 2021. All actions have \nbeen completed and verified. \n \n16.  Under (indicative) subprogram 3, the government will (i) complete the roll-out of PCF, with \nPVET institutions spending not less than 95% of their approved 2020 budget allocation; (ii) \nevaluate the SVET PCF pilot program before determining whether to complete the nationwide roll \nout; and (iii) approve the National Qualifications Framework and implement at least 95% of all \nactions in the NQS Action Plan. The government will establish and operationalize 12 additional \nMCs (3 outside Bishkek) with 20% of female teachers and staff, and at least 30% of women in \ndecision making positions, and ensure 4 out of 8 additional MCs are fully operational (with 20% \nof female teachers and staff, and at least 30% of women in decision making positions) in \naccordance with the approved MOES guidelines and action plan. The government will approve \nan allocation of $250,000 for the SDF in 2022 with women comprising at least 30% of participants \nin the training provided. In the medium-term, budget allocations will be complemented and \nincreasingly substituted by the introduction of a training levy or other private sector cost-share \nmechanisms. \n \n17.  Reform area 5: Fiscal and social protection resilience to enable post-COVID-19 \nstabilization and recovery improved. This reform area aims to strengthen fiscal management \nand improve resilience to macroeconomic shocks in the future by also expanding the number of \nsocial protection beneficiaries in a transparent, evidence-based and targeted manner. This reform \narea is critical to build the foundation of a more inclusive and sustainable recovery post COVID-\n19 (para. 3 v).39 Under subprogram 2, to ensure all future emergency support is provided on-\nbudget and to improve consolidated control, monitoring, recording and management reporting, \nMOF approved an Order to report on all expenses related to COVID-19 (incorporating all financial \nassistance provided for COVID-19 into the consolidated report of the treasury management \ninformation system and mandatory completion of ex-post audits and disclosure of the results on \nMOF\u2019s website). The government approved a new Strategy for Public Debt Management, 2020\u2013\n2023 setting targets to deepen the domestic debt market, improve public debt management and \nensure COVID-19 emergency response support remains within prudent debt limits.40 To further \nenhance Government\u2019s ability to rapidly respond to shocks in the future, MOF (i) approved the \nMedium-Term Action Plan for Development of Public Finance Management, 2020\u20132022 to chart \nkey emerging reform objectives in budget planning, medium-term budget forecasting, public \n \n39 In addition, 3 policy actions that have been developed and agreed with the government will also be considered within \nthe implementation of the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association (IDA) Sustainable Development \nFinance Policy (SDFP) to which ADB will be aligned during the ADF13 period. The objective of the SDFP is to \nincentivize countries to borrow sustainably and promote coordination between IDA and other creditors. The relevant \npolicy actions are PA 3.14 and PA 3.15 in the PDMF. \n40 Key measures from the new Strategy include medium-term indicators for debt sustainability and a medium-term \ntarget for domestic debt. The government commenced implementation through (i) issuance of an order mandating \nthe periodic preparation and approval of the next Medium-Term Debt Strategies and their annual review, (ii) adoption \nof medium-term indicators jointly prepared with IMF to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.0% of GDP and overall public \ndebt to 60% of GDP by 2024 as reflected in the Main Directions of Fiscal Policy for 2022\u20132024 (footnote 28), (iii) \nadoption of a medium-term domestic debt target of 16% of GDP by 2025 to reduce vulnerability to currency risks.  \n ", "11 \nprocurement, improving accounting and reporting standards, and improving internal audit and \ncontrol procedures; and (ii) established a fiscal buffer, known as the State Budget Reserve, within \nthe level of 1.0% of total budget expenditure, and fully funded it in the 2020 national budget. \nFinally, Cabinet submitted to Parliament fiscal rules to remove Government discretion to change \nthe annual debt ceiling and to embed a rule-based fiscal framework for determining the debt \nceiling and, amongst other things, determine corrective measures and sanctions to be applied if \nthe debt ceiling is breached (defining special circumstances in which the debt ceiling may be \nbreached  as  well  as  the  path  for  fiscal  adjustment).  Recognizing  that  it  would  need  to \naccommodate increasing pressure on its social protection program, the government established \na \u201csingle window\u201d, a national hotline and informational portal, for citizens that need social \nprotection due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This single window enabled vulnerable groups, \nespecially  those  that  have  been  greatly  affected  by  the  pandemic  such  as  the  recently \nunemployed and poor families that have lost their main source of income, and victims of domestic \nviolence, to request social assistance through the hotline.41 The government also improved the \nMinistry of Labor and Social Development (MLSD) database structure and data collection by \nimposing  sex,  age,  and  regional-disaggregated  information  collection  of  social  protection \nbeneficiaries when they apply for assistance (allocating resources for rapid validation).42 All \nactions have been completed and verified. \n \n18.  Under (indicative) subprogram 3, the MOF will introduce legal amendments to the Law on \nthe Budget and the Budget Code to enable mandatory annual publishing of (i) the government\u2019s \nannual borrowing plans and fiscal risk statement as reflected in the budget, and (ii) the annual list \nof borrowings of the seven largest state-owned enterprises and ensure that their international \nfinancial  reporting  standards  (IFRS)-based  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  the \naccompanying notes are publicly disclosed. To strengthen fiscal transparency and resilience, the \ngovernment will prepare and publish a detailed annual fiscal risk assessment. The government \nwill also amend the eligibility criteria and reconfigure business processes of the Monthly Benefit \nfor Poor Families with Children (MBPFC) and unemployment benefits to increase coverage of \nsocial  protection  and  ensure  high  uptake  rates  by  newly  vulnerable  groups.  Finally,  the \ngovernment will legislate the provision of a guaranteed but sustainable minimum level of social \nservices for vulnerable groups. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is a longstanding partner in each of the reform areas \nproposed. Subprogram 2 builds on this strong base of country knowledge and more than a decade \nof close collaboration, policy dialogue and reform effort (footnote 5), which has survived several \npolitical cycles due to strong bipartisan support. This strong relationship has enabled ADB to \nsignificantly contribute to the government\u2019s economic diversification efforts, as well as, (i) promote \ngender empowerment and ensure its formalization in government\u2019s policy agenda, (ii) rapidly \nrestructure the program to support immediate challenges of the Government during a period of \npublic health and macroeconomic crises, (iii) introduce and promote other enabling policy reforms \nthat have not received high priority in the past such as fiscal and debt management and social \nprotection, and (iv) rapidly repurpose and provide additional TA to support reform preparation, \nimplementation and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n20.  Lessons Learned. Key lessons from past interventions and ADB\u2019s experience with policy-\n \n41 More than 471,000 people (around 7% of the population) have applied for support. \n42 This disaggregated data will help improve the overall social protection system by improving transparency, targeting \nand alignment of social protection programs in the future. To establish a new targeting framework for social protection \nof vulnerable groups, and immediate integration of the unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the victims \nof domestic violence, the Government approved updating of the MLSD social protection database to include data \ndisaggregated by sex, age and region. \n ", "12 \nbased lending in Kyrgyz Republic and Central Asia have been incorporated into program design:43  \n(i)  ADB should help develop blueprints for institutional reforms, since these are critical \nfor successful implementation of policy-based loans along with development partner \ncoordination. Implementation of institutional reforms are more effective and efficient when \nthere is an adequate and detailed blueprint with clear and measurable results indicators. \n(ii)  ADB should continue to support business and investment climate reforms. The use of \nlong-term  and  adaptable/flexible  programmatic  assistance  and  TA  is  recommended  to \nsupport a medium-to long-term reform path, and necessary for sustainability of reforms. \n(iii)  Phasing of technical and vocational education and training reform. Project interventions \ndemonstrated that TVET reform takes time to be effective, and that the engagement of \nstakeholders, particularly industry, is slow. Engagement over 10\u201315 years, involving three or \nfour project cycles and links to related programs for policy reform is likely to provide the most \neffective and sustainable results. \n \n21.  Development partner coordination. The program was prepared in close consultation \nwith  other  development  partners,  including  through  the  DPCC. 44  Trade  and  investment \ncompetitiveness, SME and gender empowerment reforms have been coordinated with the World \nBank (WB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  United Kingdom \nForeign Commonwealth and Development Office, the EU, and the United Nations (UN) agencies; \nPPP reforms with the WB and International Finance Corporation; Food security reforms with the \nUN agencies and the Food and Agriculture Organization; Governance and fiscal management \nwith the IMF, the EU and the WB; and Social protection with the UN agencies. The government \nhas requested budget support from other development partners for the years to come through the \nDPCC, and has sought debt restructuring where possible. In 2021, only ADB is providing policy-\nbased lending. The IMF confirmed in its assessment letter of 19 May 2021 that its updated Debt \nSustainability Analysis, which includes  the proposed ADB financing of $80 million, indicates that \nthe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s debt remains sustainable and at moderate risk of debt distress for both \nexternal public debt and total public debt (footnote 27).  \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n22.  The overarching objective of the program is the \"creation of decent jobs, providing decent \nemployment and stable income for people\" (NDS 2040). As outcome, the program aims to  have \nbroad-based economic growth increased.45 There are no revisions to the outcome or output \nindicators under the original programmatic approach, as these remain fully aligned with the \ncurrent reform proposals. Links between the reform proposals and the outcome can be illustrated \nas follows: (i) for reform area 1, for example, improved compliance with export market regulations \ncan help increase utilization of preferential market access into the EU from 60% to 80% by 2023; \n(ii) for reform area 2, for example, key reforms can help ensure that by 2023 the OJSC Guarantee \nFund lends 30% of its portfolio to its women-headed SME clients, which will be a substantial \nimprovement over the current situation; (iii) for reform area 3, for example, an international best \npractice PPP policy, legal and institutional framework can ensure that the government is able to \nmeet its significant infrastructure needs in a fiscally responsible way; (iv) for reform area 4, for \nexample, improvements in the match between the education system curricula and sector- and \nindustry-needs will be demonstrated by the percentage of firms that identify an inadequately \neducated workforce as a major constraint to business development declining from 33% in 2014 \n \n43 Independent Evaluation Department (IED).

This will be demonstrated \nby the reduction of overall public debt to 60% by 2024 while also improving social assistance and \nprotection.47 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n23.  The government\u2019s overall financing needs amount to around $337 million (or 4.2% of \nGDP) in 2021 and $349 million (or 4.0% of GDP) in 2022. The budget deficit in 2021 will be \npartially supported by the proposed loan and grant totaling $80 million. As per the government\u2019s \nfinancing strategy, the balance will be financed through further cuts in non-priority expenditure \n(para. 5). As Government securities currently account for only 8.0% of banking sector assets, \nthere is room for absorption in the domestic financial market. However, if sufficient financing \ncannot be mobilized, the government will identify non-priority expenditure cuts and renew efforts \nto engage with international partners to mobilize more concessional resources rather than higher \ndomestic financing, which may increase borrowing costs and crowd out private credit (footnote \n27). For subprogram 2, the government has requested (i) a concessional loan of $69.3 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $10.7 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund). The loan will have a 24-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. ADB \ndetermined the proposed loan and grant size considering the government\u2019s commitment to \neconomic diversification reforms and the country\u2019s development financing needs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  MOF will be the executing agency for subprogram 2 following the government\u2019s decision \nto prioritize high-level administrative attention to the implementation of the restructured program \nin order to secure much needed policy financing. MOF, MOE, MOES and MLSD will be the \nimplementing agencies. MOF, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and MOE will monitor and evaluate the \noverall effectiveness of the program through the program completion report process. These three \nagencies  have  extensive  experience  with  implementing  ADB-financed  policy-based  lending \nprograms and are responsible for supporting and monitoring the implementation of the policy \nmatrix and leading inter-agency coordination of the PPEF, the latter of which is being included to \nhighlight the trajectory and conclusion of the reform path. Support for reform implementation was \nprovided through ongoing TA (footnote 30). The implementation period is August 2019\u2013March \n2021 for subprogram 2. Subprogram 3 is expected to be implemented from April 2021\u2013June 2022. \nThe PPEF is expected to be implemented in 2022 and 2023. The proceeds of the policy-based \nloan and grant will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time).48 \n \n \n \n \n \n46 World Bank. 2019.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  Safeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is \nclassified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or \nlead to involuntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \nProgram  proceeds  will  not  be  used  for  any  activities  resulting  in  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. 49 \n \n26.  Poverty and social.  Until the crisis, the country had registered good progress in poverty \nreduction, as the general poverty rate (by national definition) fell from 31.7% of total population in \n2008\u20132009 to 22.4% (some 1,429,621 people) in 2018. A large proportion of the population \nremains vulnerable: in 2015, 35% of the population had income between the national poverty line \nand 1.5 times that level (footnote 12). A large section of the population is thus either poor or \nvulnerable to poverty, at risk of a minor income shock that push them into destitution. The COVID-\n19 pandemic has swelled the numbers of those who are either in self-employment or in precarious \nemployment, and do not have access to meaningful support in times of crisis through the national \nsocial protection system. While the impact of the crisis is being picked up in the official poverty \ndata and analyzed, information from the World Food Programme (WFP) May 2020 survey points \nto growing food security concerns (footnote 12).  \n \n27.  Gender. The program\u2019s gender categorization is \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming\u201d. Key \npolicy actions aim to ensure that women are represented as beneficiaries, agents of change and \ndecision makers, and that women are considered in the reform areas of the program. For \nexample, in adopting and implementing measures to increase access to finance for women-\nheaded SMEs, such as the 30% quotas offered under the \u201cFinancing of Business Entities \nProgram\u201d and by the OJSC Guarantee Fund, the program mitigates the loss of income of women \nentrepreneurs (who head 35% of SMEs) and women workers who make up around 33% of the \nSME  workforce  and  who  have  been  disproportionately  affected  by  the  pandemic.50 Other \nmeasures as targets for female staff in capacity building activities for IAs, the number of teaching \nstaff and senior management positions in the MCs reserved for women, will help ensure gender \nempowerment  measures  are  mainstreamed  into  formal  government  policy  and  operations. \nDomestic violence is widespread and on the rise, and affects women of all social strata. The \ncollection of sex-disaggregated data has been prioritized throughout the program. \n \n28.  Governance. ADB completed a Governance Risk Assessment in 2018 in line with the \nimplementation guidelines of its Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.51 The \nassessment found that the country\u2019s PFM, public procurement and anticorruption systems were \nfunctioning well. However, there were also significant weaknesses across all three areas that \nrequired strong political will and joint development partner support to address. In the PFM area, \nfor example, poor revenue forecasting, budget credibility, investment planning, off-budget fund \nreporting and reconciliation, financial management information system use and interoperability, \nand internal and external auditing, need to be prioritized. In public procurement, procuring entities \ncannot undertake two-stage bidding and strategic procurement planning is not undertaken due to \n \n49 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n50 In TVET system female teacher are less represented in technical subjects (transport, energy, construction, metal \nprocessing) and prevail in subjects like accounting, sewing, and cooking. Gender segregation in education continues \nin the labor market, where women dominate in often lower-paid sectors. Measures such as quotas for teaching, staff \nand senior management positions in the MCs reserved for women will help ensure gender empowerment is \nmainstreamed into formal government policy and operations. \n51 ADB. 2006.

Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are highlighted in \nthe policy design and monitoring framework and described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.54 The risk that the volatile political situation and changes in leadership \nlead to weakening reform momentum is mitigated by the following: (i) the new Government has \nformally requested and agreed to the proposed subprogram (subprogram 1 was approved by the \nprevious Government), and (ii) the economic diversification agenda has widespread political and \nbureaucratic support (para. 19). It is the overall objective of the NDS 2040, the \u201cUnity, Trust and \nProsperity,  2018\u20132022\u201d  program  (the  medium-term  development  plan  of  the  previous \nGovernment) and the \u201cReal Targets, New Perspectives, 2021\u20132025\u201d program (the plan of the \nnew Government).  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOF. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nand grant agreements. All policy actions completed by the government as specified in the policy \nmatrix relating to the program will have to continue to be in effect. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan and grant would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the loan of $69,300,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for subprogram 2 of the Promoting \nEconomic Diversification Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $10,700,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the subprogram 2 of the \nPromoting Economic Diversification Program, from  ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; and the inclusion \nof subprogram 3 in the programmatic approach (para. 9).  \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \n  31 August 2021                President \n \n52 Although corruption is perceived to be high, the prosecution of several former ministers and senior civil servants has \nincreased since 2018 demonstrating government\u2019s commitment to reducing corruption. \n53 ADB. 2018.
