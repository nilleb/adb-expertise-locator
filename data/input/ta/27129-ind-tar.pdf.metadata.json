INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Country Programming Mission in January 1993, the Government of\nIndia requested the Bank to provide technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Faridabad-Noida-\nGhaziabad (FNG) Expressway Project. A Bank Mission visited India from 21 April-4 May 1993\nand reached an understanding with the Government on the scope of TA for the feasibility study\nfor the project.!!\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\nA.\t Background\n2. Rail and road are the dominant modes of transport, carrying over 95 per cent of\nthe total domestic passenger and freight traffic. The railways provide trunk services for bulk\nmovement and road transport handles long distance services for other commodities and also\ntakes up most of the feeder and distribution activities. The road network of 2.1 million\nkilometers (km) has experienced a four-fold expansion since 1950. Nonetheless, because of\nhigh population densities throughout the country and increasing industrialization, India's road\ntransport requirements are considerable and further expansion of the road network and\nstrengthening of pavement are needed. India has received assistance for development of the\nroad subsector from the World Bank, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan and\nthe Bank.' The Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST) is responsible for the administration of\nnational highways (NHs) and allocates funds from the national budget for construction and\nmaintenance of the highways, while the State Government Public Works Departments (PWDs)\nexecute the works as agents of the Central Government. At the State level, PWDs are entrusted\nwith planning, construction and maintenance of state highways and major district roads. Local\nGovernment bodies are responsible for the majority of rural roads.\n3. Road transport in India has been developing at a rapid rate during the past three\ndecades and the trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. A relatively high\nproportion of intercity freight and passenger movements is now taking place on the NH system,\nwhich is only 2 per cent of the total road network, but carries over a third of the total traffic.\nTraffic on several sections of the NH network has reached very high levels, and some projects\nto widen sections from two lanes to four-lane divided carriageway are either under\nimplementation or being planned. Although such a solution will meet the immediate need to\naugment capacity, it will have the following drawbacks: (i) the four-lane sections will be\nintersected by the unregulated access of innumerable local roads; (ii) they will continue to\naccommodate mixed traffic, consisting of both fast and slow moving traffic, without any\nsegregation; and (iii) long-distance commercial traffic, often carrying high-value commodities,\nwill have to compete for space with local traffic, resulting in economic losses. Therefore, the\nGovernment and the Bank considered that a long-term solution to the problem will be to\nconstruct expressways, with controlled access, grade-separated junctions, adequate lane\ncapacity, modern roadside facilities and suitable safety provisions, in all heavily-trafficked main\ncorridors. Such expressways will speed up road transport and result in substantial savings in\nvehicle operating costs. The Government has already made a beginning, and an expressway\n1!\t This TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in June 1993.\n2/ Loan No. 918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved in November\n1988, and Loan No. 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved in\nOctober 1990, as well as nine TAs for $3.6 million.\nS.- \n'\u2022\t -\t .\t I\t <F\t __\u2022\t 1\t -\t -\t . t\t -\t ti", "with toll facilities between Ahmedabad and Vadodara (93 km) is under construction and its\ncontinuation to Bombay (370 km) is being considered for an engineering loan by the Bank.\nOther high-priority projects of the Government are Bombay-Nasik-Pune expressway and the\nproposed expressway between Faridabad and Ghaziabad via Noida immediately east of Delhi\n[see map at page (i)]. These expressways were identified as giving the highest economic returns\nin the Bank-financed study on Development of Long-Term Plan for Expressways in India, 1990-\n1991.\n4. The current issues in the road subsector are being dealt with in processing of the\nproposed National Highways Project. These issues mainly concern: road maintenance, vehicle\nfleet modernization and axle loads, road safety, vehicle pollution and road subsector taxation.\nAlthough maintenance was neglected in the past, since fiscal year 1985/86, the Government has\ngiven increasing attention to maintenance and allotted more funds for it. As a result, the\nmaintenance situation has improved, particularly on the national highways. The ongoing\ntechnical assistance for pavement management of national  highways!! will support more cost-\nefficient maintenance. Based on a World Bank-financed study completed in 1989, the\nGovernment is taking steps towards increasing the use of multi-axle trucks, and has consulted\nthe Bank on the action plan being prepared to implement the study's major recommendations\non technical upgrading and relative lower taxation for multi-axle trucks commensurate with the\nless pavement damage caused by these trucks compared with two-axle trucks. Since the\napproval by the Government of the Motor Vehicle Act in September 1988 and its related rules,\nwhich for the first time incorporated heavy fines for overloaded vehicles, excessive loads are\nnow less common. The enforcement of the rules is also expected to result in improved road\nsafety and a reduction in the level of pollution from motor vehicles. Under the Second Road\nProject, specific assurances have been obtained from the Government about identification and\nremoval of accident-prone locations on national highways, and enforcement of emission control\nstandards; the Government is complying with these covenants. The revenues that can be\nconsidered to be derived from the road subsector far exceed the road construction,\nmaintenance and administration expenditures (about three times) and even if the maintenance\nexpenditures are increased to the optimum level required, the estimated revenues would still\nexceed expenditures by 80 per cent. However, if the need for road improvements, including\nexpressways, in relation to the fast growing road traffic is considered, the revenues may just\ncover the required expenditures.\n5. The internal influence area of the proposed expressway comprises the national\ncapital of Delhi with a population of 8 million, and the towns of Faridabad in Haryana State, and\nNoida and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh State with a combined population of 4.5 million. About\n40 per cent of the employed in the area works in the industrial sector, which shows the\nimportance of industries in the FNG corridor. These industries produce automobiles and spare\nparts, rubber and plastics, chemicals, electric appliances, electronics, pharmaceuticals and\ntextiles. In addition, many food and beverage processing plants are located in the area, which\ndespite its predominantly urban character also produces 660,000 metric tons of agricultural\nproducts. The future growth in the area will primarily be concentrated in the New Okhla\nIndustrial Development Area (NOIDA) and the Greater NOIDA zone on both sides of the\nproposed expressway. The topography of the area is mostly flat terrain with intermittent levees\nto control the rivers, Yam una and Hindan, and streams in the floodplains. Traffic volumes in the\ntransport corridor between Ghaziabad and Faridabad range around 60,000 motor vehicles per\nT. A.

The city and suburban roads are at present deficient in several respects, the main\ndeficiencies being poor riding surface and insufficient carriageway capacity because of heavy\ncongestion and a mix of fast and slow-moving vehicles. The expressway aims to remove these\ncapacity constraints.\nB.\t Rationale\n6. At present, the major satellite towns of Faridabad and Ghaziabad are connected\nthrough densely built-up areas of Delhi by the heavily congested sections of NH2 and the NH\n24 bypass south of Ghaziabad. At the Faridabad endpoint the expressway will link up with the\nongoing four-lane construction works between Ballabgarh and Mathura on NH2 being financed\nunder Loan No. 918-IND. No railway line links the two towns directly. The expressway\nalignment will pass through open land and will be about 43 km long, excluding the spur link to\nFaridabad. It will cross the Yamuna River and initially will include four lanes and five\ninterchanges, with provisions for future widening. The expressway project is included in the\nMaster Plan for the National Capital Region (NCR) and in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992/93-\n1996/97).\" Its location is also in accordance with the NCR Planning Board's (NCRPB) urban\ndevelopment plan for the capital region. The Government of India and the State Governments\nconcerned (Haryana and Uttar Pradesh) attach high priority to the expressway as a toll facility\nwith possible private sector participation. The proposed improvements will substantially\nincrease the capacity in the transport corridor supporting the industrial sector and the project\nwill, therefore, be in accord with the Bank's operational strategy for India.\n7. Although the expressway is considered, prima facie viable, a feasibility study is\nrequired to confirm its economic viability and to determine the level of improvement, financial\nviability, the potential for private sector participation and the environmental impact. Technical\nassistance is considered necessary to provide support in the form of consulting services to the\nExecuting Agency and the State Governments concerned, to ensure that the project will be\nprepared in a form acceptable to potential investors, including the Bank.\nIll.

Consulting services will be provided to\ncarry out project preparation work under the TA (see Appendix 1 for terms of reference). The\nfirst phase of the work will focus on traffic studies, a study of modal options and the selection\nof a suitable alignment for the expressway, while the second phase will be devoted to feasibility\nstudies of the selected alignment. The scope of services under Phases I and II comprises the\nfollowing main activities.\nPhase I\n(i) Review traffic surveys already carried out in the States of Haryana and\nUttar Pradesh, and conduct additional traffic surveys at appropriate\nlocations to verify the current pattern and volume of traffic movements by\nroad and rail in the FNG transport corridor.\n(ii) Assess the alignment options for the expressway on the basis of available\ntraffic data, expressway construction costs tentatively calculated on the\nbasis of typical cross-sections, the Yamuna River bridge crossing and\nenvironmental and other important considerations.\n(iii) Carry out an environmental impact assessment study of the expressway\nproject.!!\nPhase II\n(i) Carry out topographic surveys, analyze previous axle-load studies and\nconduct all other relevant investigations related to the expressway.\n(ii) Establish suitable design standards for the expressway and prepare\npreliminary designs and cost estimates for the project based on the\nprovision of toll facilities for a closed system.\n(iii) Carry out feasibility studies of the project expressway, after dividing it into\nsections carrying more or less homogeneous traffic volumes and calculate\nthe economic and financial internal rates of return for each section and for\nthe expressway as a whole.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10.

The total cost of the ensuing expressway project expected to emerge from\nthe TA is tentatively estimated at $120 million (excluding land acquisition costs of about $12\nmillion equivalent), of which about $60 million will be the foreign exchange cost.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. It is envisaged that about 14 man-months of consulting services by international\nconsultants in the fields of highway/tollway and pavement engineering, transport economics and\nenvironmental assessment, and about 36 man-months of services by domestic consultants in\nthe fields of highway, structural, soils and materials engineering, transport planning and traffic\nengineering, will be required under the TA. The consultants will be recruited by the Bank in\naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n12. The Executing Agency for the proposed TA will be MOST. Within MOST the\nAdditional Director General (Roads) or any senior officer who may be designated by him will be\nresponsible for day-to-day coordination. NCRPB and the State PWDs of Uttar Pradesh and\nHaryana will act as Implementing Agencies, and will provide necessary facilities, including traffic\ndata, maps, aerial photographs, hydrological model test results for the Yamuna River in the\nproject area,!! and counterpart staff to the consultants. Prior to commencement of the\nconsulting services a Steering Committee, chaired by the Additional Director General (Roads)\nof MOST and with members from MOST, NCRPB, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, the Ghaziabad\nDevelopment Administration and the Faridabad Complex Administration, as well as key staff of\nthe consultants will be established. During implementation the Steering Committee will meet\nmonthly. Following submission of the Phase I report after two months, a meeting of the\nSteering Committee will be held in Delhi to, among other things, consider the consultants'\nrecommendations for route alignment and agree upon a final alignment to be subject to a full-\nscale feasibility study over the next five months. It is expected that the consulting services will\ncommence in January 1994 and be completed within seven months, when a Phase II draft final\nreport will be submitted.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n13. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance to the Government of India in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $550,000 for the purpose of the Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad\nExpressway Project, and hereby reports his action to the Board. This technical assistance will\nbe made available initially as a grant, but will be subject to all reimbursement arrangements set\nforth in the relevant Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51 -77, dated\n20 May 1977 and Doc. R44-88, dated 21 March 1988) including the provision that in the event\nof the technical assistance resulting in a loan from the Bank, the Bank may charge against, and\nrecover from, such loan that portion of the initial grant that exceeds $250,000.\n1!

The project preparation work will be carried out in two phases. Phase I (about\ntwo months) will focus on a study of the modal options in the FNG transport corridor and\nselection of a suitable alignment [within a narrow corridor of about one-km width] for the\nexpressway on the basis of construction costs, right-of-way availability and environmental\nconsiderations. Phase II (about five months) will consist of a feasibility study of the expressway\nfor the selected expressway alignment under alternative toll rate scenarios based on a closed\ntoll collection system. Relevant activities listed under Phase II may commence during Phase I\nand continue through Phase II. At the end of Phase I, a meeting of Government representatives,\nincluding the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST), the New Okhla Industrial Development\nAuthority (NOIDA) of Uttar Pradesh State, the Ghaziabad Development Administration, the\nFaridabad Complex Administration, the National Capital Planning Board (NCRPB), and the\nPWDs of the Delhi Administration (DA) and the States of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and the\nconsultants, will be held in the field to review the Phase I recommendations and agree on any\nchanges needed in the scope of work under Phase II arising out of the recommendations. Apart\nfrom this meeting the above-mentioned parties will meet monthly in a formal Steering Committee\nto review progress and to discuss the consultants' findings; potential private investors may be\ninvited to attend these meetings.

At the State level, PWDs are entrusted\nwith planning, construction and maintenance of state highways and major district roads. Local\nGovernment bodies are responsible for the majority of rural roads.\n3. Road transport in India has been developing at a rapid rate during the past three\ndecades and the trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. A relatively high\nproportion of intercity freight and passenger movements is now taking place on the NH system,\nwhich is only 2 per cent of the total road network, but carries over a third of the total traffic.\nTraffic on several sections of the NH network has reached very high levels, and some projects\nto widen sections from two lanes to four-lane divided carriageway are either under\nimplementation or being planned. Although such a solution will meet the immediate need to\naugment capacity, it will have the following drawbacks: (i) the four-lane sections will be\nintersected by the unregulated access of innumerable local roads; (ii) they will continue to\naccommodate mixed traffic, consisting of both fast and slow moving traffic, without any\nsegregation; and (iii) long-distance commercial traffic, often carrying high-value commodities,\nwill have to compete for space with local traffic, resulting in economic losses. Therefore, the\nGovernment and the Bank considered that a long-term solution to the problem will be to\nconstruct expressways, with controlled access, grade-separated junctions, adequate lane\ncapacity, modern roadside facilities and suitable safety provisions, in all heavily-trafficked main\ncorridors. Such expressways will speed up road transport and result in substantial savings in\nvehicle operating costs. The Government has already made a beginning, and an expressway\n1!\t This TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in June 1993.\n2/ Loan No. 918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved in November\n1988, and Loan No. 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved in\nOctober 1990, as well as nine TAs for $3.6 million.\nS.- \n'\u2022\t -\t .\t I\t <F\t __\u2022\t 1\t -\t -\t . t\t -\t ti", "with toll facilities between Ahmedabad and Vadodara (93 km) is under construction and its\ncontinuation to Bombay (370 km) is being considered for an engineering loan by the Bank.\nOther high-priority projects of the Government are Bombay-Nasik-Pune expressway and the\nproposed expressway between Faridabad and Ghaziabad via Noida immediately east of Delhi\n[see map at page (i)]. These expressways were identified as giving the highest economic returns\nin the Bank-financed study on Development of Long-Term Plan for Expressways in India, 1990-\n1991.\n4. The current issues in the road subsector are being dealt with in processing of the\nproposed National Highways Project. These issues mainly concern: road maintenance, vehicle\nfleet modernization and axle loads, road safety, vehicle pollution and road subsector taxation.\nAlthough maintenance was neglected in the past, since fiscal year 1985/86, the Government has\ngiven increasing attention to maintenance and allotted more funds for it. As a result, the\nmaintenance situation has improved, particularly on the national highways. The ongoing\ntechnical assistance for pavement management of national  highways!! will support more cost-\nefficient maintenance. Based on a World Bank-financed study completed in 1989, the\nGovernment is taking steps towards increasing the use of multi-axle trucks, and has consulted\nthe Bank on the action plan being prepared to implement the study's major recommendations\non technical upgrading and relative lower taxation for multi-axle trucks commensurate with the\nless pavement damage caused by these trucks compared with two-axle trucks. Since the\napproval by the Government of the Motor Vehicle Act in September 1988 and its related rules,\nwhich for the first time incorporated heavy fines for overloaded vehicles, excessive loads are\nnow less common. The enforcement of the rules is also expected to result in improved road\nsafety and a reduction in the level of pollution from motor vehicles. Under the Second Road\nProject, specific assurances have been obtained from the Government about identification and\nremoval of accident-prone locations on national highways, and enforcement of emission control\nstandards; the Government is complying with these covenants. The revenues that can be\nconsidered to be derived from the road subsector far exceed the road construction,\nmaintenance and administration expenditures (about three times) and even if the maintenance\nexpenditures are increased to the optimum level required, the estimated revenues would still\nexceed expenditures by 80 per cent. However, if the need for road improvements, including\nexpressways, in relation to the fast growing road traffic is considered, the revenues may just\ncover the required expenditures.\n5. The internal influence area of the proposed expressway comprises the national\ncapital of Delhi with a population of 8 million, and the towns of Faridabad in Haryana State, and\nNoida and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh State with a combined population of 4.5 million. About\n40 per cent of the employed in the area works in the industrial sector, which shows the\nimportance of industries in the FNG corridor. These industries produce automobiles and spare\nparts, rubber and plastics, chemicals, electric appliances, electronics, pharmaceuticals and\ntextiles. In addition, many food and beverage processing plants are located in the area, which\ndespite its predominantly urban character also produces 660,000 metric tons of agricultural\nproducts. The future growth in the area will primarily be concentrated in the New Okhla\nIndustrial Development Area (NOIDA) and the Greater NOIDA zone on both sides of the\nproposed expressway. The topography of the area is mostly flat terrain with intermittent levees\nto control the rivers, Yam una and Hindan, and streams in the floodplains. Traffic volumes in the\ntransport corridor between Ghaziabad and Faridabad range around 60,000 motor vehicles per\nT. A.

The city and suburban roads are at present deficient in several respects, the main\ndeficiencies being poor riding surface and insufficient carriageway capacity because of heavy\ncongestion and a mix of fast and slow-moving vehicles. The expressway aims to remove these\ncapacity constraints.\nB.\t Rationale\n6. At present, the major satellite towns of Faridabad and Ghaziabad are connected\nthrough densely built-up areas of Delhi by the heavily congested sections of NH2 and the NH\n24 bypass south of Ghaziabad. At the Faridabad endpoint the expressway will link up with the\nongoing four-lane construction works between Ballabgarh and Mathura on NH2 being financed\nunder Loan No. 918-IND. No railway line links the two towns directly. The expressway\nalignment will pass through open land and will be about 43 km long, excluding the spur link to\nFaridabad. It will cross the Yamuna River and initially will include four lanes and five\ninterchanges, with provisions for future widening. The expressway project is included in the\nMaster Plan for the National Capital Region (NCR) and in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992/93-\n1996/97).\" Its location is also in accordance with the NCR Planning Board's (NCRPB) urban\ndevelopment plan for the capital region. The Government of India and the State Governments\nconcerned (Haryana and Uttar Pradesh) attach high priority to the expressway as a toll facility\nwith possible private sector participation. The proposed improvements will substantially\nincrease the capacity in the transport corridor supporting the industrial sector and the project\nwill, therefore, be in accord with the Bank's operational strategy for India.\n7. Although the expressway is considered, prima facie viable, a feasibility study is\nrequired to confirm its economic viability and to determine the level of improvement, financial\nviability, the potential for private sector participation and the environmental impact. Technical\nassistance is considered necessary to provide support in the form of consulting services to the\nExecuting Agency and the State Governments concerned, to ensure that the project will be\nprepared in a form acceptable to potential investors, including the Bank.\nIll.

The total cost of the ensuing expressway project expected to emerge from\nthe TA is tentatively estimated at $120 million (excluding land acquisition costs of about $12\nmillion equivalent), of which about $60 million will be the foreign exchange cost.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. It is envisaged that about 14 man-months of consulting services by international\nconsultants in the fields of highway/tollway and pavement engineering, transport economics and\nenvironmental assessment, and about 36 man-months of services by domestic consultants in\nthe fields of highway, structural, soils and materials engineering, transport planning and traffic\nengineering, will be required under the TA. The consultants will be recruited by the Bank in\naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n12. The Executing Agency for the proposed TA will be MOST. Within MOST the\nAdditional Director General (Roads) or any senior officer who may be designated by him will be\nresponsible for day-to-day coordination. NCRPB and the State PWDs of Uttar Pradesh and\nHaryana will act as Implementing Agencies, and will provide necessary facilities, including traffic\ndata, maps, aerial photographs, hydrological model test results for the Yamuna River in the\nproject area,!! and counterpart staff to the consultants. Prior to commencement of the\nconsulting services a Steering Committee, chaired by the Additional Director General (Roads)\nof MOST and with members from MOST, NCRPB, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, the Ghaziabad\nDevelopment Administration and the Faridabad Complex Administration, as well as key staff of\nthe consultants will be established. During implementation the Steering Committee will meet\nmonthly. Following submission of the Phase I report after two months, a meeting of the\nSteering Committee will be held in Delhi to, among other things, consider the consultants'\nrecommendations for route alignment and agree upon a final alignment to be subject to a full-\nscale feasibility study over the next five months. It is expected that the consulting services will\ncommence in January 1994 and be completed within seven months, when a Phase II draft final\nreport will be submitted.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n13. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance to the Government of India in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $550,000 for the purpose of the Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad\nExpressway Project, and hereby reports his action to the Board. This technical assistance will\nbe made available initially as a grant, but will be subject to all reimbursement arrangements set\nforth in the relevant Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51 -77, dated\n20 May 1977 and Doc. R44-88, dated 21 March 1988) including the provision that in the event\nof the technical assistance resulting in a loan from the Bank, the Bank may charge against, and\nrecover from, such loan that portion of the initial grant that exceeds $250,000.\n1!

The project preparation work will be carried out in two phases. Phase I (about\ntwo months) will focus on a study of the modal options in the FNG transport corridor and\nselection of a suitable alignment [within a narrow corridor of about one-km width] for the\nexpressway on the basis of construction costs, right-of-way availability and environmental\nconsiderations. Phase II (about five months) will consist of a feasibility study of the expressway\nfor the selected expressway alignment under alternative toll rate scenarios based on a closed\ntoll collection system. Relevant activities listed under Phase II may commence during Phase I\nand continue through Phase II. At the end of Phase I, a meeting of Government representatives,\nincluding the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST), the New Okhla Industrial Development\nAuthority (NOIDA) of Uttar Pradesh State, the Ghaziabad Development Administration, the\nFaridabad Complex Administration, the National Capital Planning Board (NCRPB), and the\nPWDs of the Delhi Administration (DA) and the States of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and the\nconsultants, will be held in the field to review the Phase I recommendations and agree on any\nchanges needed in the scope of work under Phase II arising out of the recommendations. Apart\nfrom this meeting the above-mentioned parties will meet monthly in a formal Steering Committee\nto review progress and to discuss the consultants' findings; potential private investors may be\ninvited to attend these meetings.
