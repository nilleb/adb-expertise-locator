During  the  2012  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to support Anhui Province in formulating a development strategy for its northern \nsubregion. The proposed TA is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 \nfor the PRC,1 which is aligned with the priorities of the government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan for \nNational Social and Economic Development, 2011\u20132015.2 The proposed TA addresses issues \nrelated to regional disparity, poverty alleviation, and urban\u2013rural integration in Anhui. 3 These \nissues are also relevant for other parts of the PRC.  \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission visited Anhui on 8\u201311 July 2013. The mission met with \ngovernment  agencies  and  think  tanks  at  various  administrative  levels.  An  agreement  was \nreached on the main features of the TA, including impact, outcome, outputs, activities, financing \nplan, terms of reference for consulting services, and implementation arrangements with the \nAnhui provincial government and the Ministry of Finance. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Three decades of successful reforms have transformed the PRC into the world\u2019s second \nlargest economy and facilitated its swift transition from a low-income to a middle-income country. \nHowever, the PRC still faces complex development challenges, including significant poverty, \nspreading environmental pollution, large income inequality, widening regional and rural\u2013urban \ndisparities, and low productivity in traditional sectors. Failure to decisively implement further \nreforms to address these challenges would jeopardize the PRC\u2019s long-term growth prospects. \n \n4.  These challenges also exist in Anhui. Located in the PRC\u2019s central region, the province \nhas a population of 68 million and a territory of 139,000 square kilometers. When market \nreforms started in the late 1970s, Anhui piloted a rural household contract responsibility system \n(hukou), which catalyzed the success of agrarian reforms in the PRC. The province has also \npioneered other significant initiatives, including the abolition of agricultural taxes and other fiscal \ncharges on farmers. Since the market reforms, Anhui has made impressive progress in social \nand economic development. However, like other inland provinces, Anhui has benefited less \nfrom international trade and foreign direct investment due to weak infrastructure and limited \naccess to overseas markets. \n \n5.  Compared to its coastal neighbor provinces, Anhui has a relatively underdeveloped \neconomy, less integrated urban\u2013rural development, wider disparity among its subregions, and a \nhigher  poverty  incidence.  The  province\u2019s  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was \nCNY28,792 ($4,704) in 2012, about 75% of the national average. Its urbanization rate was \n46.5%, or 6 percentage points lower than the national average. Its rural poverty ratio was 14.7%, \nhigher than the national average of 13.4%. \n \n6.  Subregional disparity is of great concern for the provincial government. Anhui stretches \nacross the Yangtze River. Accordingly, the province is divided into three subregions in the north, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Beijing. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 June 2013. \n ", "2   \nthe south, and the center of Anhui. The southern subregion includes the Huangshan mountains, \na world famous tourism site. For that reason, this subregion has successfully implemented a \ndevelopment strategy concentrated on tourism. The central subregion is an urban corridor along \nthe Yangtze River and the most prosperous and dynamic part of Anhui. Compared with the two \nother subregions, the northern subregion faces more serious development challenges. Further, \na consensus has yet to evolve among stakeholders on a suitable development strategy for the \nsubregion.  \n \n7.  The northern subregion of Anhui (NSRA), covering six cities and five counties, with a \npopulation of 36 million and a territory of 53,000 square kilometers, has lagged in terms of \nsocioeconomic  development.  In  2012,  its  per  capita  GDP  was  CNY19,141  ($3,127),  its \nurbanization rate was 40.8%, and its rural poverty ratio was 15.2%. All of these indicators fall \nbehind the province\u2019s average, as mentioned in paragraph 5.   \n \n8.  The major development challenges in the NSRA include the following: \n \n(i)  Less developed transport infrastructure. Water transport along the Huai River is \nunderdeveloped as measured against its potential and market demand. The NSRA \nalso lacks railways to connect its economic centers. While there are expressways \ngoing through the subregion, the NSRA is short of exit and entry points, including \nconnecting  roads  between  its  major  economic  centers  and  villages.  Lack  of  an \nintegrated  transport  system  has  become  the  bottleneck  in  the  subregion\u2019s \ndevelopment. \n(ii) Underdeveloped industries and services. The NSRA is rich in natural resources, \nparticularly minerals. This is why mining rather than industry was prioritized in the \npast. While there is potential for developing tourism thanks to abundant cultural \nheritage  and  natural  scenery,  the  region  has  few  successful  tourism  sites. \nUnderdeveloped services, such as finance, logistics, and cultural industries, are also \nhampering growth.  \n(iii) Slowed urbanization and low productivity. The NSRA has 53% of the province\u2019s \npopulation, but produces only 33% of its GDP. The NSRA\u2019s population density is well \nabove Anhui\u2019s average, and as a result the NSRA\u2019s per capita arable land area is \nwell below the provincial average. Most of the residents are farmers with limited \neducation and skills. As young and educated farmers have moved to industry and \nservice sectors outside the subregion, urbanization in the NSRA faces many other \nconstraints, including the large number of farmers, water scarcity and water pollution, \ninadequate  public  infrastructure,  underdeveloped  industries  and  services,  long \ndistances to major economic centers, and high migration rates.  \n(iv) Frequent floods and water scarcity. The NSRA is largely located in the Huai River \nBasin. Rather than being a resource for socioeconomic development as in other river \nbasins, the Huai River constrains development due to frequent flooding. At the same \ntime, the region faces serious water scarcity because of low rainfall and uneven \nwater distribution. Water pollution and overexploitation of underground water also \nthreaten the region.    \n9.  The Anhui provincial government requested ADB\u2019s help in developing an integrated \ndevelopment strategy for the NSRA to address and mitigate the key development challenges \noutlined in paragraph 8. The proposed TA aims to assist the Anhui provincial government in \nformulating an integrated and balanced development strategy for the NSRA. The strategy will \n ", "  3 \naddress five strategic needs: (i) developing an integrated transport network to better connect the \nNSRA\u2019s  economic  centers;  (ii)  improving  banking  and  financial  services  to  effectively  use \nfinancial resources and improve financial inclusion; (iii) promoting the development of resource-\nefficient  industries  and  sustainable  urbanization;  (iv)  improving  water  resources,  including \nwatershed and flood risk management; and (v) developing social policies to deal with emerging \nsocial issues, in particular those related to population migration and land reform to help farmers \nattain increased living standards.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact will be improved socioeconomic development in the NSRA. The \nperformance targets include an increase of 1 percentage point annually in the urbanization rate \nuntil 2019, from a baseline of 40.8% in 2012. The outcome will be an improved enabling policy, \nlegal, and regulatory environment for balanced and sustainable development in the NSRA. As a \nperformance  target,  policy  recommendations  under  the  TA  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nprovince's new policies and planning documents issued during 2014\u20132017. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  comprehensive  report  on  promoting  socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the NSRA, and (ii) five policy notes. The report will comprise an overview report \nand  five  subreports  on  (i)  integrated  road-,  rail-  and  water-based  transport  systems;  (ii) \ndevelopment of banking and financial services; (iii) development of resource-efficient industries \nand  sustainable  urban  development;  (iv)  water  resources  management,  watershed \nmanagement,  and  flood  risk  management;  and  (v)  social  development  related  to  migrant \nworkers  and  land  management.  The  policy  notes  will  summarize  key  findings  and \nrecommendations on targeted and selected topics during TA implementation. The policy notes \nwill be distributed to senior government officials at various administrative levels for consideration \nin policy making. They will also serve as progress reports to inform senior government officials \nof the TA findings and conclusions. In addition, review workshops and dissemination seminars \ninvolving key stakeholders will be organized at different stages of TA implementation.  \n \n12.  Drawing on experience and lessons learned from similar TA projects, the proposed TA \nwill  conduct  an  analysis  of  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats,  including \ndiagnostics to reveal underlying constraints; review relevant policy and legal documents to \nidentify institutional impediments; combine international and national expertise; seek guidance \nfrom senior local government officials; and set up an independent expert review panel to ensure \nthe quality of the TA outputs. 4 \n \n13.  The main assumptions include the development of the NSRA remaining a high priority \nfor  the  provincial  government,  policy  recommendations  being  reviewed  and  selected  by \n                                                \n4  Since 2003, ADB has provided eight technical assistance projects to 13 provincial governments in the PRC to help \nformulate provincial development strategies. The recipients were Anhui Province, Chongqing Municipality, Gansu \nProvince, Guizhou Province, Guangdong Province, Hebei Province, Heilongjiang Province, Hubei Province, Hunan \nProvince, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Jiangxi Province, Jilin Province, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion. The assistance to Anhui, Hubei, and Guangdong is still ongoing. The Anhui TA component focuses on \nimproving the rural environment and aims to assist the province in developing policies and programs to (i) protect \nrural ecosystems, (ii) deal with industrial pollution in the countryside, (iii) manage rural household solid waste, and \n(iv) reduce water and soil pollution stemming from the use of chemicals in agriculture.   \n ", "4   \ngovernment  agencies  objectively,  and  senior  government  officials  guiding  the  TA \nimplementation.  \n \n14.  The key activities for the first output will be (i) submission of the draft inception report, (ii) \nholding of an inception workshop, (iii) submission of a draft interim report, (iv) holding of an \ninterim report review workshop, (v) submission of draft final report, (vi) holding of a draft final \nreport review workshop, and (vii) holding of a dissemination workshop. The key activities for the \nsecond output will be (i) submission of two policy notes based on the interim report and (ii) \nsubmission of three policy notes based on the final report.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $480,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  logistical \nsupport. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months, from 1 November 2013 to 30 June 2015. \nThe Anhui Provincial Development Research Center will be the executing agency. To guide and \nmonitor TA implementation, a steering committee led by the Anhui Provincial Development \nResearch Center will be established, comprising members from the Anhui Provincial Finance \nDepartment, the Anhui Provincial Development and Reform Commission, the Anhui Provincial \nEnvironment Protection Department, the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Department, the Anhui \nProvincial  Housing  and  Construction  Department,  the  Anhui  Provincial  Economy  and \nInformation Department, the Anhui Provincial Land Department, government think tanks, and \nother government agencies.  \n \n17.  The executing agency will set up a project management office to administer the TA \nproject and provide logistical support to the consultants. The government counterpart staff of \nAnhui will assist the consultants in carrying out their assignments by providing basic statistical \ndata, updating policy information, and arranging consultation meetings with local government \nofficials. The executing agency will administer the training, conferences, and seminars. An \nadvance payment facility may be established if requested. \n \n18.  The  executing  agency  will  provide  office  space  with  computers,  utilities,  and \ntelecommunication  equipment  (including  a  broadband  internet  connection).  The  executing \nagency will also cover remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, designate a TA focal \npoint with strong English speaking and writing skills, and facilitate all TA activities to ensure \neffective TA implementation. \n \n19.  In consultation with the executing agency, ADB will recruit international and national \nexperts to provide inputs as consultants, and act as short-term resource persons and task-\nspecific experts. The international and national consultants (including resource persons and \ntask-specific  experts)  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  by  ADB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).
