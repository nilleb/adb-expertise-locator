INTRODUCTION\n1. In 1998, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh requested the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to prepare a long-term regional plan for\nthe Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) Region, similar to ADB\u2019s earlier TA for the Northwest Region\nDevelopment and Investment Study.1 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission in June 1999 and\nthe  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  September  1999,  which  reached  an  understanding  with  the\nGovernment on the objective, scope, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for\nthe TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 1999 country assistance plan for Bangladesh.2\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The CHT Region has an area of about 13,300 square kilometers (km2), accounting for\n9 percent of the total area of Bangladesh.3 The region\u2019s population was estimated at one\nmillion according to the 1991 Census, but is now estimated at more than 1.4 million due to an\nincreasing number of people returning from the neighboring states of India and from other\nregions of the country. However, the region\u2019s population density is still the lowest in the\ncountry, estimated at about 100 people per km2 as compared with the national average of\nabout 800 per km2. More than half of the region\u2019s population are tribal hill people, consisting of\nmore than 10 ethnic groups with each having its own dialect, cultural practice, and rituals. The\nremaining population consists of Bengali immigrants, who migrated into the region from other\nparts of the country. Although precise estimates are not available, poverty incidence in the\nregion is considered to be higher than the national average of 48 percent for the rural area in\nthe country.4 Poverty and inadequate capacity for human development are more prevalent\namong the hill people living in the remote and hilly areas.\n3. The CHT Region is a hilly area, has lower maximum and minimum temperatures than\nother parts of the country, and average annual rainfall is about 2,700 millimeters. More than 80\npercent of the annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season from May to October. The\nregion is suitable for commercial horticulture. Despite its abundant natural resources and\ndevelopment potential, the region\u2019s contribution to the national economy is still negligible with\nan average annual gross regional product of Tk32.7 billion ($0.7 billion) estimated for a three-\nyear period from 1995 to 1997, accounting for about 3 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct. About 60 percent of the region\u2019s production comes from agriculture, of which about 80\npercent is attributed to forestry. The permanently cropped area on flat lands is very small,\nbeing estimated at about 1,000 km2, or less than 8 percent of the total land of the region. Only\nabout 14 percent of the cropped area has some form of irrigation facilities. This gives heavy\npressure on the existing cropped area. Shifting cultivation with short-term cycles is widely\npracticed now in grove lands on hill slopes, resulting in soil erosion in various places.\n4. A large-scale migration of people from other parts of the country into the CHT Region\nfor settlement on arable land started in the early 1970s. This resulted in political turmoil and led\nto an insurgency movement. Since then, a large number of households either fled to the\nneighboring  states  of  India  or  were  displaced  within  the  country.  This  situation  seriously\naffected the livelihoods of the region\u2019s population and slowed the socioeconomic development\n                                           \n1 TA BAN 2545: Northwest Region Development and Investment Study, for $1.1 million, approved on 21 March\n1996.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 February 1999.\n3 Including three districts of Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati.\n4 The poverty line for Bangladesh is defined to be a nutritional intake of 2,122 calories per day.", "2\nof the region for nearly 20 years. In December 1997, a peace accord was signed between the\nGovernment and the Association of the Chittagong Hill Tracts People, representing the people\nof the CHT Region, to end the armed conflict. The peace accord recognized the need for\nattaining overall development of the region, and for protecting the special characteristics of the\nCHT Region as  a  tribal  inhabited  area.  Subsequently,  the  Hill  District  Local  Government\nCouncil Act was amended to reflect the peace accord in the institutional framework of local\ngovernments in the region and to establish a regional council for facilitating development\nactivities  in  accordance  with  the  signed  peace  accord.  The  CHT  Regional  Council  was\nestablished in May  1999  and  started  its  function  recently  to  coordinate  the  development\nactivities in the CHT Region.\n5. At present, the region\u2019s development activities are mainly implemented by the CHT\nDevelopment Board (CHTDB) under the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MCHTA).\nCHTDB was created in 1976 and has carried out more than 1,000 schemes since then, which\namount to a total of Tk2.8 billion ($57 million) including projects financed by external funding\nagencies. The annual budget of CHTDB now amounts to about Tk500 million ($10 million).\nThe ADB also provided assistance in agriculture and rural development through CHTDB in the\nearly 1980s.5 CHTDB\u2019s activities constitute about 70 percent of the total development activities\nin the region. Other projects and programs are being carried out by the hill district councils and\nsubdistrict (called thana) administrations.\n6. Under the Fifth Five-year Plan covering FY1998 to FY2002, the Government aims at\nexpediting socioeconomic development of the CHT Region as one of the priority development\nregions. The provision of increased financial and human resources is planned for the CHT\nRegion to support (i) better utilization of the existing  health and educational facilities, (ii)\nimprovement of transport and communications facilities, (iii) mineral resources development,\n(iv)  increased  provision  of  agricultural  extension  services  for  agriculture  and  horticulture\ndevelopment, (v) expansion of agro-based processing industries, (vi) provision of safe drinking\nwater, (vii) prevention of soil erosion, and (viii) tourism development. The Government and\nlocal government councils recognize the urgent need to initiate development projects and\nprograms in the CHT Region, as a long delay in the implementation of development projects\nmay disappoint the residents about the effect of the peace accord (para. 4).\n7. In view of the high priority accorded for the CHT Region, Government agencies have\nformulated preliminary project proposals for the region. By April 1999, the Government had\nabout 40 proposals to be considered for public investment. However, these proposals need to\nbe carefully reviewed and screened based on local needs assessments. Similarly, the rapid\nexpansion of nongovernment organization (NGO) activities in the region requires effective\ncoordination in the field. Against this background, the Government, external funding agencies,\nand NGOs generally concur that a long-term development plan acceptable to all the concerned\ncommunities  in  the  region  is  required  to  provide  strategic  direction  for  the  region\u2019s\ndevelopment, and to coordinate various development and investment activities in line with\nsuch a strategy.6\n                                           \n5 Loan BAN 404: Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Project, for $28.5 million, approved on 28 June 1979 and\nclosed in July 1992. Project components were completed generally as specified at the time of appraisal except for\nafforestation and rubber processing components.\n6 For instance, the Association of Development Agencies of Bangladesh, which represents major NGOs in the\ncountry,  organized  a  workshop  in  June  1998  to  discuss  the  NGOs\u2019  possible  strategy  and  roles  for  the\ndevelopment of the CHT Region. The proceedings of the workshop were compiled in its publication, called CHT\nPeace Treaty and Development Strategy, February 1999.", "3\n8. At present, the activities of external funding agencies relating to the CHT Region are\nbeing coordinated at meetings of a local consultative group of external funding agencies in\nBangladesh. Brief needs assessment studies have been carried out by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme. Some bilateral funding agencies commenced small-scale activities\nrelating to health and sanitation in the CHT Region. ADB is also preparing a rural development\nproject.7 Under these circumstances, major external funding agencies have expressed their\nsupport for ADB\u2019s initiative in assisting the Government to formulate a long-term development\nplan for the CHT Region.\n9. The TA will help achieve the Government\u2019s special development objective to facilitate\nthe socioeconomic development of the CHT Region, uphold the basic human rights of all the\ncitizens in the region, and build their confidence in the effectiveness of the peace accord.\nADB's intervention through the TA, in collaboration with other external funding agencies, will\nhelp the Government resolve issues relating to the implementation of the peace accord. The\nTA is in consonant with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy for Bangladesh, and can form the\nbasis for ADB\u2019s longer commitment to supporting development efforts in the CHT Region.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n10. The TA will assist the Government in formulating for the CHT Region a long-term\ndevelopment plan (the plan) that includes a development strategy covering the next 10 years\nand  a  profile  of  potential  investment  projects  with  full  consideration  for  the  special\ncharacteristics and local resource endowments of the region. The plan will aim at reducing\npoverty through disseminating benefits among all communities in the region and facilitating the\nintegration  of  the  region  into  the  country\u2019s  overall  economy.  The  TA  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA will (i) assess local needs in the region based on the surveys in the past and\nsupplementary field surveys; (ii) examine the physical and socioeconomic characteristics and\nconditions of the CHT Region with a particular emphasis on the situation of poverty; (iii) assess\nthe region\u2019s resource endowments and development potential; (iv) identify constraints to the\nregional growth and development, including institutional weaknesses; (v) review and screen\nthe ongoing and planned investment projects and programs for the region; (vi) determine the\nregion\u2019s  phased  development  strategy  through  an  iterative  consultation  process  with  key\nstakeholders  in  the  region;  (vii)  prepare  a  phased  investment  program  and  preliminary\nfeasibility studies of potential projects identified in the investment program; (viii) integrate these\nplanning elements into a common regional plan acceptable to the region\u2019s communities; and\n(ix) estimate the specific resource requirements for the plan. The TA will be a multisector study\ncovering, among other things, transport, agriculture, rural development, health,  education,\ntourism, and forestry and natural resources, and will be closely coordinated with the ongoing\nproject preparatory TA for CHT Rural Development Project (para. 8).\n                                           \n7 TA BAN 3213: CHT Rural Development Project, for $500,000, approved on 30 June 1999, and expected to be\ncompleted in March 2000. This TA will build upon the outcome of TA BAN 3213, which carries out a baseline\nsurvey in the region, to avoid overlapping and inconsistency.", "4\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,260,000 equivalent, comprising $762,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $498,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide\n$1,000,000 to finance the entire foreign exchange costs and $238,000 equivalent in local\ncurrency costs. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund,\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The balance of the local currency costs, amounting to\n$260,000 equivalent, will be met by the Government from its own resources to cover office\naccommodation,  salaries  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff,  field  transport,  facilities  for\nworkshops and seminars, and local administrative support. The detailed cost estimates of the\nTA are in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n13. The  MCHTA,  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  and  will  assume  overall\nresponsibility  for  TA  implementation  and  coordination.  MCHTA  will  establish  a  TA\nimplementation office, and appoint a coordinator and full-time counterpart staff before TA\ninception  to  manage  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  TA.  Since  the  TA  will  be  a\nmultisector  planning  exercise,  the  Government  will  establish  before  TA  inception  an\ninterministerial TA steering committee, which will be chaired by the Secretary of MCHTA and\ninclude representatives from the Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Planning  Commission,  the  CHT\nRegional Council, three hill district councils, CHTDB, and other relevant Government agencies.\nTo ensure local ownership of the plan, the CHT Regional Council, three hill district councils,\nand communities in the region will be closely consulted during TA implementation, particularly\nthrough local workshops and regional and national seminars to be organized under the TA.\nThe TA steering committee will monitor TA implementation and provide the TA with overall\npolicy guidance. The TA implementation office will act as the secretariat to the committee. ADB\nhas also established a working group, comprising the staff of the relevant ADB departments\nand offices, to review the TA outputs.\n14. The TA implementation will be supervised through tripartite review meetings among the\nGovernment, the TA consultant and ADB. The meetings will be organized by MCHTA three\ntimes during TA implementation. The members of the steering committee will participate in\nthese  meetings.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  presented  for  discussion  at  the  tripartite  review\nmeetings, and at the regional and national seminars. The TA will be implemented through\nclose  consultation  and  coordination  with  major  external  funding  agencies  and  NGOs,\nparticularly  with  NGOs  based  in  the  CHT  Region.  A  final  evaluation  of  the  TA  will  be\nundertaken jointly by the Government and ADB based on the draft final report to be prepared\nunder the TA.\n15. The TA will be implemented over a period of nine months from March to December\n2000, and will be broadly divided into three phases: Phase I (three months) for the assessment\nof local needs and development potential, Phase II (three months) for the formulation of a\ndevelopment strategy for the CHT Region through an iterative consultation process with local\nstakeholders, and Phase III (three months) to finalize the plan and preliminary project profiles\nfor the region.\n16. The  TA  will  require  consulting  services,  consisting  of  (i)  25  person-months  of\ninternational consultants in regional planning, agriculture, transport and communications, rural\nhealth, environment and natural resources, sociology and indigenous people, and financial and", "5\neconomic  analyses;  and  (ii)  36  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  in  agricultural\nmarketing, transport and communications, rural health, environment and natural resources,\ngender, financial and economic analyses, institutional analysis, law, and industrial promotion.\nThe regional planning specialist will serve as the team leader of the consultant team. The\nconsulting services will be provided by an international consulting firm in association with a\nqualified domestic consulting firm that has a sound financial position and an adequate number\nof qualified staff. The consultants for the TA will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nthe engagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants\nare in Appendix 3.\n17. The consultant will purchase office equipment and supplies in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The office equipment will be handed over to the Government at\nTA completion. The equipment procured under ADB\u2019s earlier TA (para. 8) and installed at a\ngovernment office in Rangamati will be also used for the TA. The consultant will prepare (i) an\ninception  report  including  a  detailed  work  program  for  the  TA,  to  be  submitted  to  the\nGovernment and ADB within three weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the\ninception tripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report for presenting the assessments made\nunder the TA and the development strategy proposed for the region to be submitted within five\nmonths of TA implementation and discussed at the interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft\nfinal report, to be submitted at least one month before TA completion and to be discussed at\nthe final tripartite review meeting; and (iv) a final report at the completion of the TA. The interim\nreport will consist of an executive summary and a main report. The draft final and final reports\nwill  comprise  an  executive  summary,  a  main  report,  sector  reports,  and  appendixes  for\nadequate data and information on the region.\n18. The consultant will prepare, organize, and conduct local workshops, and regional and\nnational seminars under the TA. Representatives of the relevant agencies of the Government,\nthe CHT Regional Council, hill district councils in the region, circle chiefs, CHTDB, chambers of\ncommerce, community representatives, NGOs, and external funding agencies will be invited to\nthe workshops and seminars. A regional seminar will be organized in Rangamati to present\nand discuss the consultant\u2019s interim report after five months of TA inception, and a national\nseminar to be held in Dhaka to present and discuss the consultant\u2019s draft final report. The\nseminars will coincide with the tripartite review meetings and ADB missions.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic\nof Bangladesh in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the purpose of the\nChittagong Hill Tracts Region Development Plan, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Indicators and Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions/Risks\nSector/Area Goal\nPoverty reduction among \u2022  Complete rehabilitation \u2022  National and regional Favorable macroeconomic\npeople in the Chittagong of 12,000 tribal statistics. environment in the country and\nHill Tracts (CHT) Region. households that were in South Asia.\ndisplaced during the \u2022  Regular dialogue and\narmed conflict. interactions with the\nGovernment, local\n\u2022  Reduction in the region\u2019s councils, and local\npoverty incidence communities in the CHT\ncurrently estimated to be Region.\nhigher than the national\naverage of 48 percent\n(1996).\nProvision of equal access \u2022  Increase in the number\nto income-generating of local enterprises in the\nopportunities among CHT Region.
