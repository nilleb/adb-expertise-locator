The Government of  Cambodia has requested technical assistance (TA) from Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to design and prepare the Financial Sector Development Program  \n(SDP). The outputs of the TA will include an SDP1 document that follows on from the Financial \nSector Program Loan I (FSPL I)2 and is in line with the financial sector Blueprint for Cambodia \n(currently being updated).3 A TA grant of $650,0004 has been earmarked under the Japan \nSpecial Fund to prepare the SDP, expected to be approved in 2007. The TA Fact-Finding \nMission5 visited Cambodia in May 2006 and had detailed consultations with the Government \nand  key  stakeholders  on  the  expected  overall  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  cost \nestimates, implementing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. The \nfindings of the Mission and understandings reached with the Government are reflected in this \npaper. The TA Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1 with achievements of the \nFSPL I in the Supplementary Appendix. The Initial Poverty and Social Analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The development framework for Cambodia\u2019s financial sector is based on the 2001\u20132010 \nfinancial sector blueprint (the \u201cBlueprint\u201d) that was developed with ADB support and adopted by \nthe Government in late 2001. Since implementation of the Blueprint, there has been progress in \ncertain areas of the sector; in other areas, lessons have been learned from international and \ndomestic experience. Those experiences, plus new challenges that have recently emerged, \nprompted the Government to request further support from ADB to update the Blueprint so that it \nmay more accurately reflect the current situation. It is expected that the Blueprint update6 will be \ncompleted by the third quarter of 2006 and that the updated Blueprint will include an evaluation \nof activities to date, the framework for continued reform in the financial sector over the next 10 \nyears, and useful inputs for the design of the SDP.  \n \n3.  Throughout the FSPL I implementation period, steady progress has been made towards \nachieving the program\u2019s objectives even though the buildup for the general election in 2003 and \nthe  one-year  delay  in  forming  the  new  National  Assembly  affected  implementation  during \nsubprogram II. Reforms to date in a financial sector that is dominated by the banking subsector \nhave helped to establish a relatively sound legal framework with strong prudential norms. This \nenabled the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to close down 16 nonviable banks in 2002 and \nraise the capital requirements for the remaining banks. Although there is now a relatively strong \nbanking subsector and some growth in financial services, financial deepening and outreach \nremain challenges.  \n \n4.  The performance of Cambodia\u2019s financial sector has been satisfactory. The ratio of \nbroad money supply (M2) to gross domestic product (GDP) has risen from 12.6% in 2000, \nbefore the start of the program, to 18.6% of GDP in 2005. Credit to the private sector has \ncorrespondingly risen from 6.4% of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 9.4% in 2005. Total deposits \nwere close to 15% of GDP in 2005, compared with 9.5% of GDP in 2000. Despite these positive \n                                                 \n1  The SDP will comprise an information technology project to computerize the National Bank of Cambodia and a \npolicy-based component for a total loan of $33 million. The program component is expected to adopt the same \nprogram loan cluster approach that was successfully used for FSPL I. \n2  ADB. 2001.

Cambodia: Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001\u20132010. Manila \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 April 2006. \n5  The Mission comprised Samiuela Tukuafu (financial specialist/mission leader), and Vanndy Hem (economics and \nfinance officer, CARM). \n6  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Financial Sector Blueprint Update. Manila. \n ", "2   \ndevelopments, there are still policy gaps, implementation challenges, and capacity constraints \nthat need to be addressed in each of the subsectors, as noted below. \n \n5.  Banking. There are in Cambodia at present 15 commercial banks, 4 specialized banks \n(including the state-owned Rural Development Bank), and 2 representative offices of foreign-\nbased banks. All registered banks are adequately capitalized following the relicensing process \nthat set the minimum capital requirement at $13 million equivalent (2002) and minimum capital \nadequacy  at  15%  (2004).  The  average  capital  adequacy  was  32%  and  overall  ratio  of \nnonperforming loans to total net loans was 7.5% at the end of 2005. Banks have been free to \nset their own interest rates since 1995, and the average annual interest rate spread tends to be \nhigh.  Spreads  were  around  12%  in  2005,  with  most  banks  maintaining  high liquidity.  The \noperations  of  individual  banks  need  to  be  reviewed  and  measures  taken  to  address  key \ngovernance structures, upgrade staff skills, encourage competition, and strengthen compliance \nwith new statutory requirements (uniform chart of accounts, regular provision of prudential \nreports, anti-money laundering requirements, credit information sharing systems, publication of \naudited financial statements, and others). Apart from banking supervision, other areas requiring \nadditional work include upgrading prudential requirements to international standards and best \npractices, improving skills of the NBC staff, as well as enhancing surveillance and enforcing \nregulations to ensure the safety of public deposits and integrity of the banking system. \n \n6.  Insurance. Of the three operating insurance firms, one is 100% state-owned. There is \nalso a locally registered reinsurer that is 80% state-owned. State shares are held by the Ministry \nof Economy and Finance (MEF), but, since MEF is the regulator of insurance activities, an \nimportant reform item has been to try divesting those shares so that MEF can perform its \nregulatory functions equitably. The insurance sector, with a total premium income of only $10.5 \nmillion (0.18% of GDP) in 2005, is still in its early stage of development, and the underlying \nconcepts and business transactions are very new in Cambodia. The main insurance products \navailable locally are those that address liabilities arising from construction work and public \ntransport  accidents,  as  well  as  motor  vehicle  third  party  policies.  A  comprehensive  and \ntransparent  legal  and  regulatory  framework  that  is  based  on  core  insurance  principles, \ninternational  best  practices,  and  tailored  training  support  programs  and  incentives  is  a \nprerequisite for growth. \n \n7.  While FSPL I has had some success in introducing a legal and regulatory framework, \nestablishing the regulator within MEF and transforming insurance agents to fully functional \ninsurance firms so as to compete with the state-owned insurance company have had mixed \noutcomes. Reorienting the Government\u2019s role from sole operator to regulator has not been easy, \nas the required skills must be built up over time and regulatory enforcement has been weak. \nPressing requirements include to upgrade prudential regulations to international standards, \nimprove staff skills, encourage competition on a level playing field, strengthen surveillance, and \nenforce regulations. \n \n8.  Microfinance. Though small, the subsector has come a long way. As of March 2006, \nthere  were  16  licensed  and  24  registered  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  were  not \ngovernment operated. Active borrowers using micro business loans (average size of $182) \nnumbered 89,176 clients at the end of 2004, and the figure for small business loans (average \nsize of $1,720) was 25,984. There is potential for growth. Voluntary savings in MFIs are very \nsmall. NBC has established a supervisory unit for MFIs, and further support will be required to \nenhance its off-site and on-site capabilities. Integrating the microfinance subsector into the \nmainstream financial sector will be one of the solutions to the problem of formal access to \nfinancial services by small and medium enterprises and rural households. This will require \neducation and public awareness services, rural outreach, and specially designed products and \nservices for rural and low-income households.  \n ", "  3\n \n9.  Interbank and Money Markets. Some progress has been made in developing interbank \nand money markets. Formal establishment of the Bankers Association helped in forming the \nCambodia Institute of Banking, implementing the uniform chart of accounts, and developing the \npilot system for sharing credit information among members. The law on negotiable instruments \nand payment transactions that was adopted by the National Assembly in 2005 provides the \nlegal basis for further development of payment systems, introducing new negotiable instruments, \nand promoting development of a money market. Four implementing regulations have been \ndeveloped, and support will be required for implementing the approved law and regulations. \n \n10.  Legal and Supporting Infrastructure. Key legislation has been adopted since the 2001 \ncommencement  of  the  FSPL  I  concerning  the  following  areas:  insurance,  accounting, \ncommercial  enterprises,  negotiable  instruments  and  payment  transactions,  and  commercial \narbitration.  The  process  of  getting  these  key  pieces  of  legislation  adopted  by  the  various \ncommittees of the Council of Ministers and National Assembly required more time than was \ninitially envisaged under FSPL I. Currently under consideration at various levels of the approval \nchain are drafts for the following laws: secured transactions, insolvency, anti-money laundering, \nanticorruption, and leasing. All require technical assistance to help the lawmakers understand \nthe underlying legal concepts and, in so doing, increase the likelihood that these laws will be \nadopted and implemented within the initial time plan. There is also a need to revise existing \nlegislation to reflect the status of commercial development and practices in Cambodia. \n \n11.  Work has commenced under FSPL I, with complementary technical support from the \nWorld  Bank,  in  developing  accounting  and  auditing  practices.  The Kampuchea  Institute  of \nCertified Public Accountants and Auditors (KICPAA)7 has been established, and it has bylaws, a \ncode of ethics, and key committee structures. Since there are approximately just 24 locally \nqualified members, KICPAA is seeking to increase its membership. Additional scholarships \nneed  to  be  made  available  on  a  competitive  basis  to  build  a  core  of  qualified  members \n(estimated at 150) to enable KICPAA to function effectively. Similarly, key regulations to aid \nimplementation of the Accounting Law need to be adopted and training needs to be provided for \nthose who will be implementing them.  \n \n12.  Information Technology (IT) Project for NBC. The NBC\u2019s internal operating systems \nand processes are mostly manual. With growing responsibilities, increasing transactions volume, \nand the NBC serving a rising number of clients, the need for modernized operating systems and \nprocesses is urgent. With ADB support, the NBC in 2004 did its own assessment of its key \nfunctional departments\u2019 IT needs. A final report was produced in late 2004 that supported \nmodernization of NBC\u2019s key operations: payment and settlement, internal accounting, foreign \nreserves management, economic and financial databases for economic research, and bank \nsupervision. A detailed feasibility study is needed to determine the specific IT requirements of \neach  department,  appropriate  software  and  hardware,  and  the  associated  costs.  This  will \nprovide the basis for NBC to determine which of those activities can be financed out of the \nproject loan from ADB, the implementation schedule, procurement arrangements, and other \nfinancing sources. \n                                                 \n7  The  United  Kingdom-based  Association  of  Chartered  Certified  Accountants  (ACCA)  provides  a  3.5-year \naccreditation program for KICPAA. A memorandum of cooperation between the National Accounting Council, \nKICPAA, and CPA Australia was signed in May 2006. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact is improved financial intermediation and sustainable economic growth. The \nexpected outcome will be improved soundness and efficiency of the financial system. The SDP \nwill focus on (i) the banking, insurance, and microfinance subsectors; (ii) the related legal and \nregulatory framework; (iii) interbank and money market development; (iv) strengthening financial \nmarket infrastructure; and (v) modernizing the NBC\u2019s key operating systems and processes. \nThereby, it will support the Government\u2019s ongoing reform efforts that aim to address governance \nand corruption issues, problems with access to finance, high transaction costs, limited access to \nquality information, staff capacity, and increasing competition in what should be a level playing \nfield.  \n \n14.  The program design will take into account strategies for private sector development and \nprovide a focused and sequenced series of policy measures consistent with and supplementary \nto the Government\u2019s overall framework for reform as stated in the 10-year Financial Sector \nBlueprint (updated). The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is expected to deliver \nthe following outputs: \n(i)  A policy matrix and action plan for further development of the financial sector, \nwith estimated adjustment costs and a financing plan (including a development \npolicy letter from the Government). \n(ii)  A  design  and  monitoring  framework  that  identifies  inputs,  activities,  outputs, \noutcomes, and impact of the proposed SDP, including risks and measures to \nmitigate those risks, baseline data and mechanism for regular monitoring and \nreporting. \n(iii)  Awareness-  and  consensus-building  workshops  and  seminars  with  key \nstakeholders in Government, the private sector, and the donor community to \nproduce a final report reflecting the structure of the program as discussed and \nagreed to with all stakeholders. \n(iv)  A program administration manual to guide the Government in implementing the \npolicy conditions. \n(v)  The design of implementation arrangements and capacity building to ensure that \npolicy conditions are implemented in an appropriate, consistent, and coordinated \nmanner. \n(vi)  A project loan design (in a design and monitoring framework reflecting a cost and \nbenefit  analysis  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements,  inputs, \nactivities, outputs, outcomes and impact, risks and measures to mitigate those \nrisks) to help computerize key operating functions of the NBC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The PPTA will draw on the Blueprint update and include an evaluation of the results of \nFSPL I. An integral part of the PPTA will be to ensure active dialogue with key policymakers and \nother public and private sector stakeholders in the financial sector. Findings, program and \nproject  proposals,  and  other  deliverables  will  be  presented  and  discussed  regularly  with \npolicymakers and other stakeholders. Workshops will be organized with the executing agency, \nimplementing agencies, and related stakeholders to adopt the final report and program design \nby April 2007. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost a total of $775,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$650,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by \nthe Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent that \nincludes  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  administrative  support,  and  other \nmiscellaneous  services.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance an \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The  NBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  TA \nactivities. NBC and relevant departments within NBC will be the implementing agencies for the \nbanking and microfinance subsectors, related regulations, supervisory functions, payment and \nsettlement systems, interbank and money markets, training institutes, and the IT project. MEF \nwill be the implementing agency for the insurance subsector, as well as for accounting and \nauditing components. The Ministry of Commerce will be the implementing agency for developing \nthe legal and regulatory framework and for related components. Each implementing agency will \nprovide office space, counterpart staff, and other support services to the consultants. \n \n18.  The TA is scheduled to commence on 1 September 2006 and is to be implemented over \na period of 12 months. The consulting services comprise 20 person-months of international and \n18 person-months of domestic consulting input. Terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. Experience in Cambodia has shown that firms, as opposed to individuals, have \nbeen more expensive and have not been successful in recruiting the right mix of consultants, \nespecially  when  the  project  requires  a  diverse  set  of  expertise.  For  this  reason,  a  team \ncomprising individual international and national consultants and an international consulting firm \nwill be used. Three of the international consultants (Central Banking Expert, IT Systems Design \nExpert, and Accounting Expert), who will together contribute 9 person-months of international \nconsulting services, and one national consultant (IT Expert) who will contribute 6 person-months \nof national consulting services, will be engaged by ADB on an individual basis. The remaining \n11 person-months of international and 12 person-months of national consulting services will be \ncontracted out to a consulting firm with a budget allocation of about $380,000. Quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures and a simplified technical proposal will follow, and consultants will \nbe selected in accordance with ADB guidelines.8  \n \n19.  The team leader will be responsible for preparing a detailed work plan before the start of \nservices, which will include a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA. \nThe consultants will submit interim reports for review by ADB as well as the executing and \nimplementing agencies and a draft final report, following which tripartite meetings will be held to \nfinalize the report. The final report will be submitted by April 2007 and will incorporate comments \nfrom the executing and implementing agencies and ADB during and after the tripartite meetings.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for preparing the Financial Sector Development Program, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

The SDP is expected to further increase commercial activities and financial \nintermediation by promoting development of a sound, market-based financial system to enhance the \npotential for economic growth and creating employment. Benefits of the SDP will include improved access \nto  financial  services  and  a  more  competitive,  diversified  financial  sector  that  reduces  systemic \nvulnerabilities. These benefits will be substantial and include (i) strengthening of the legal and regulatory \ninfrastructure, as well as accounting and auditing practices; (ii) capacity building in the banking, insurance, \nand microfinance subsectors, as well as in the various supervisory institutions; (iii) further development of \nthe insurance and microfinance subsectors; and (iv) modernization of key functions at the National Bank of \nCambodia  (NBC)  that  include  the  payment  and  settlement  systems.  A  wider  cross  section  of  the \npopulation will benefit from an environment that is conducive to financial sector development. That \ndevelopment will be supported by (i) effective legal and regulatory reforms, (ii) well skilled employees and \na highly developed accounting profession, (iii) expanded credit from the banking subsectors to support \neconomic activities, and (iv) the concomitant growth of such nonbank subsectors as insurance and \nmicrofinance. Beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and near poor. A broader and more balanced \nfinancial system will be more resilient to external shocks (which have serious implications for the poor). \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nConsultants will review previous and recent poverty studies to determine financial services needs and understand the \nissues affecting provision of those services.
