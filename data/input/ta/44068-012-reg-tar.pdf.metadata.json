INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) seeks to address the lack of robust evidence on \nthe options and costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and reduce the negative \neffects of climate change (adaptation) in Central and West Asia.1 Preliminary consultations with \nthe target countries during missions fielded in 2010\u20132012 indicated support for the TA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Climate change presents unprecedented threats to the achievement of development \ngoals in the countries of Central and West Asia. Some of these countries\u2014Afghanistan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan\u2014are among the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of \nclimate change, requiring significant investments in climate change adaptation to reduce risks to \ncritical infrastructure, vulnerable communities, and ecosystems. Some other Central and West \nAsia countries (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan) are among the most carbon-intensive \neconomies in the world, offering substantial opportunities for investments in energy efficiency \nand greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement.3 \n3.  Preliminary evidence indicates that Central and West Asia countries are being hit hard \nby climate change.4 Predicted warmer temperatures, accelerated glacial melt, reduced winter \nsnow cover and associated changes in river flows, and more frequent and intense drought and \nfloods threaten the stable water supply for agriculture, hydropower, and human consumption\u2014\none of the major concerns in the arid and semiarid region of Central and West Asia.5 More \nfrequent droughts, catastrophic flooding from glacial lake outbursts, and landslides caused by \ndestabilization of mountain slopes will lead to a progressive increase in economic losses and \nrisk to the population, and reduce the ability of communities to move out of poverty.6 These \nadverse effects, which will be compounded by projected population growth in the 21st century, \nwill  exacerbate  underlying  national  socioeconomic  and  environmental  constraints  such  as \ncrumbling infrastructure, land degradation, and limited institutional capacity. Key river basins, \nsuch as the Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Indus, are important to the economies of several \ncountries and to the political stability of the region, as they supply water to vast expanses of \nagricultural land and generate most  of domestic electricity in the form of hydropower. The \nongoing glacial melt and reduction of snow melt are expected to exacerbate transboundary \nwater and energy tensions in Central Asia, i.e., the clash between summer irrigation needs in \ndownstream countries (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and winter energy needs in \nupstream countries (Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan). \n                                                \n1  The concept paper was approved by Vice-President, Operations 1 on 6 January 2012. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 January 2012. \n3  Carbon intensity is defined as GHG emissions per unit of gross domestic product (tons of carbon dioxide per \n$1,000). \n4  World  Bank.  2009.

Central and West Asia offers significant opportunities for emission reduction investments \nand carbon financing. Preliminary assessments conducted to support the formulation of the \nclimate change implementation plan of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department7 show that \nAzerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  Pakistan,  and  Uzbekistan  offer  mitigation  opportunities  involving \nimproved clean energy (i.e., energy efficiency and renewable energy), fuel switching, more \nefficient industrial processes, improved waste management systems, and land restoration.8 \nEconomic  and  population  growth  in  these  countries,  coupled  with  GHG  emissions,  have \nincreased emission rates to levels higher than those of the rest of the world. However, little \ninformation  is  available  on  the  mitigation  potential  and  the  associated  cost  to  implement \neffective GHG emission reduction actions in these emission-intense countries.  \n5.  ADB has been providing assistance to Central and West Asia to adapt to the adverse \neffects of climate change and promote GHG emission reduction measures. For example, a TA \nproject in Tajikistan developed a preliminary climate vulnerability assessment of communities in \nthe Pyanj River Basin and informed the preparation of a project aimed at piloting community-\nbased adaptation in the river basin.9  Another TA project in Tajikistan will build the technical \ncapacity of a climate modeling center and a national implementing entity for climate change \nactivities.10 A regional TA project is assessing the impacts of climate change on the runoff of the \nSyr Darya and Amu Darya river basins.11 Another regional TA project is developing geographic \ninformation system-based maps of the solar and wind energy potential in 10 countries in Central \nand West Asia, supporting the Pakistan medium-term renewable energy policy, and promoting \ncarbon finance in Pakistan and Uzbekistan.12 A TA project on solar energy development is \nidentifying investment opportunities in Uzbekistan.13 While preliminary evidence indicates that \ncountries in Central and West Asia are highly vulnerable to climate change and offer good \npotential for GHG emission reduction, no assessment has been made of the economic impact of \nclimate change at the regional, national, and sub-national levels. This information is pivotal to \nbetter  understand  the  risks  that  climate  variability,  change,  and  extremes  pose  to  the \nachievement  of  countries\u2019  development  goals,  and  to  identify  adaptation  and  mitigation \ninvestments across the region. The information is also crucial to leverage the additional financial \nresources required to meet the incremental cost of climate change, and to support strategic \nmitigation and adaptation actions across the region. As countries in Central and West Asia \npossess limited institutional, technical, financial, and human capacity, they are ill-equipped to \ndeal with the additional challenges posed by a changing climate.14  \n6.  The  proposed TA  will  complement current  efforts  by filling the knowledge gaps  on \neconomic, social, and environmentally viable climate change adaptation and mitigation options \nin the target countries. The TA will support the countries\u2019 readiness for leveraging public and \nprivate sector finance to address prioritized adaptation and mitigation investment needs. The TA \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 priorities on environmentally sustainable growth, including \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.   This TA will identify priority investments for climate resilience and low-carbon growth. \nThe TA will have two components: (i) adaptation to climate change will assess the costs and \nbenefits of implementing adaptation measures to reduce the adverse effects of climate change \non energy and water resources in the most vulnerable countries, i.e., Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and Tajikistan; and (ii) mitigation of climate change will assess the costs and benefits \nof GHG emission reduction measures and formulate low-carbon growth investment proposals \nfor energy and transport in the most carbon-intensive countries in the region, i.e., Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.   The impact will be climate change actions implemented in the target countries. The \noutcome will be a better understanding of the cost of climate change in the target countries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Each country team will tailor the methodology to the local context, while maintaining a \nbasic standardized approach to be used across the target countries. Activities will build on \nnational  communications;  the  fourth  assessment  report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on \nClimate Change; and work carried out by governments, international organizations, academics, \nand nongovernment community-based organizations.  \n \n10.  Output  1.  The  cost  of  climate  change  mitigation  in  energy  and  transport  will  be \nestimated in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Output 1 will assess the cost of mitigation \nmeasures and the deployment of clean energy technologies, i.e., how much it would cost to \nreduce GHG emissions using cost-effective clean energy technologies in the target countries \nunder different emission scenarios. Output 1 will also assess the policy and measures needed \nfor  low-carbon  growth,  including  market-based  mechanisms,  energy  price  setting,  carbon \ntaxation, subsidy removal, and urban planning. Through country workshops, consultation, and \nsurveys, energy and transport emissions data will be gathered and a GHG mitigation analysis \nmethodology defined. Output 1 will (i) develop the countries\u2019 GHG baselines and projections for \ntwo time periods up to 2050; (ii) identify GHG abatement options and targets with the use of \nmarginal abatement cost curve analysis; and (iii) identify gaps and needs in climate policies and \nplans.  A  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  of  mitigation  technologies  and  policies  will  be  performed, \nincluding co-benefits in terms of energy security, competitiveness, and local environmental \nquality, to identify low-carbon growth priorities in each country. Output 1 will be supported by a \ncapacity development program aimed at training decision makers in economic analysis of low-\ncarbon growth measures and policy, and strengthening national systems for GHG emission \nmonitoring, verification, and reporting. \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "4       \n \n11.  Output  2.  Climate  change  mitigation  investment  opportunities  will  be  identified  in \nAzerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  and  Uzbekistan.  Output  2  will  formulate  nationally  appropriate \nmitigation actions for each country, with priority climate mitigation policies and measures in \nenergy and transport. Options to ensure access of women and other vulnerable groups to clean \nenergy  and  other  mitigation  measures  will  be  considered.  Climate  mitigation  investment \nproposals will be formulated in consultation with national and local stakeholders. Criteria for \nproposal selection will include GHG abatement potential, alignment with national development \npriorities,  high  sector  demonstration  value,  replication  and  scaling-up  potential,  and  cost \neffectiveness.  \n \n12.  Output 3. The cost of climate change adaptation will be estimated for Afghanistan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. Output 3 will estimate the costs and benefits of climate change \nadaptation policies and technologies in energy and water resources, i.e., by how much the benefit \nof  adaptation  (avoided  losses)  exceeds  the  cost  incurred.  Climate  change  scenarios  for \ntemperature, precipitation (rain and snow), climate-induced extreme events, and other climatic \nparameters will be developed in Afghanistan and the Kyrgyz Republic for different time periods up \nto  2100  under  different  GHG  emission  scenarios  to  identify  the  likelihood  of  exceeding \nmanageable thresholds. The impacts of climate change on energy and water resources will be \nassessed  and  adaptation  measures  identified  in  consultation  with  government  and \nnongovernment stakeholders. The impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups such as \nwomen and the youth will be assessed. Priority adaptation measures will be identified through \ncost\u2013benefit analysis based on an integrated economic assessment combined with consultations \nand field assessments. Adaptation measures will consider different systems such as cities and \nriver basins, as well as address the vulnerability of groups such as women and the youth. In \nAfghanistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, output 3 will be supported by a capacity development \nprogram  aimed  at:  (i)  training  decision  makers  in  climate  scenario  development,  economic \nanalysis  of  adaptation  technologies,  and  policy  development;  and  (ii)  strengthening  national \nsystems for climate resilience monitoring and reporting. In Tajikistan, output 3 will focus on the \neconomic assessment of adaptation measures and draw on ongoing work on climate scenario \ndevelopment and impact assessment (footnote 10). \n \n13.  Output  4.  Climate  change  adaptation  investment  opportunities  will  be  identified  in \nAfghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. Output 4 will formulate national adaptation \nplans in each country with priority investments, policy needs, and financing options. Adaptation \ninvestment proposals in water resources and energy will be developed.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,250,000 equivalent, of which (i) $1,250,000 equivalent \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund,16 and (ii) $2,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund17 under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 25 months, from December 2012 to December 2014. \nADB will be the executing agency. The Central and West Asia Department will implement the \n                                                \n16 Established by ADB. Outputs 3 and 4 (adaptation component) will be financed by the Climate Change Fund. \n17 Established by the Government of Japan. Outputs 1 and 2 (mitigation component) will be financed by the Asian \nClean Energy Fund. \n ", "           5 \n \nTA in coordination with government counterparts, the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment, and the Economics and Research Department. Government counterparts will be \nthe ministries of economic development of the target countries. Since the TA requires new \nareas of expertise and presents a high level of complexity, a quality-based selection method \nand full technical proposal will be used to engage consultants. The consultants will be engaged \nby ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of non-consulting \ninputs,  including  equipment,  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  ADB  will  recruit  consulting  firm(s)  to  provide  68.25  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services (30.00 person-months for the adaptation component and 38.25 person-\nmonths  for  the  mitigation  component),  and  173.50  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices (89.50 for the adaptation component and 84.00 for the mitigation component). The \nconsultants will have expertise in (i) climate change modeling; (ii) climate impact assessment; \n(iii)  climate  change  economics;  (iv) communications,  workshop  organization,  and  capacity \nbuilding;  (v)  GHG  emission  projections;  (vi)  marginal  abatement  cost  curves;  (vii)  energy, \ntransport, and water resources management; and (viii) finance and investment. The outline \nterms of reference for consulting services is in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  A steering committee will be set up to guide TA implementation and ensure consistency \nin the methodology across the target countries and with other ADB studies on the economics of \nclimate change. The committee will comprise representatives from the Central and West Asia \nDepartment,  the  Economics  and  Research  Department,  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, and government focal points. No activities under the TA will begin or \nbe financed in the territory of a target country until a no-objection letter has been obtained from \nthe government of the country concerned. \n \n18.  Knowledge sharing through national and regional workshops will take place during TA \nimplementation  to  define  the  methodology  for  climate  scenario  development,  impact \nassessment, and GHG baselines, and to strengthen climate change mitigation and adaptation \npractices and awareness among stakeholders, including civil society and highly vulnerable \ngroups such as women and the poor. Knowledge products will be disseminated at international \nconferences.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION  \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 for the Economics of Climate \nChange in Central and West Asia, to be financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy \nFund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  If  the  Board  approves  ADB \nadministering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by \nthe Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $1,250,000 on a grant basis for the Economics of Climate Change in Central and \nWest Asia. \n ", "6       Appendix 1       \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nClimate change actions  CO  equivalent per capita  National GHG inventories  Policy and decision \n2\nare implemented in the  reduced by 5% by 2020    makers consider climate \ntarget countries.
