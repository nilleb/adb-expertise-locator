THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation Port Access Elevated Highway Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  the  Expressway  Operations  Improvement  Project  and  the  proposed \nadministration of TA to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Supporting Trade \nLogistics Facilitation, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA and the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed project will finance the construction of about 5.3 kilometers (km) of an \nelevated toll highway with related facilities between the New Kelani Bridge (NKB) and Galle Face \nin central Colombo.1 It will provide a direct link to the city center and the port from the Colombo\u2013\nKatunayake Expressway (CKE) via the NKB, and extend the expressway network into the city.2 \nThe project will help alleviate traffic congestion in Colombo\u2019s densely populated areas, improve \nlast-mile connectivity between the country\u2019s expressway network and Colombo\u2019s international \nport, provide better logistics services for freight operations, and facilitate regional trade. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  With economic growth averaging 5.8% per year since 2009, Sri Lanka is close to attaining \nupper middle-income status.3 To serve the dynamic transformation of the economy, the transport \nsector is gradually changing to provide growth-oriented infrastructure, support more diversified \nservices, promote exports, and cater to the value-adding manufacturing industry. New economic \nactivities continue to be established close to population centers and international gateways. \nColombo is the center of commercial and administrative functions and has the largest international \nport in the country. Western Province, which includes Colombo, contributes more than 40% to the \nnational gross domestic product. About 48.7% of Sri Lanka\u2019s urban population is in Colombo, a \ndistrict with a population of 2.3 million. Improvement of traffic conditions in an area with great \npotential  is  key  to  enabling  efficient  economic  activities.  The  project  also  follows  ADB\u2019s \ncomprehensive approach in facilitating trade logistics under the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation. Improved connectivity to the port will facilitate the smooth flow of goods between \ndomestic, regional, and international markets to develop a high-value-added economy. \n \n4.  Road subsector overview of Colombo. Sri Lanka has a moderately developed road \nnetwork. Road transport accounts for 93% of the estimated 80 billion passenger-kilometers in \npassenger traffic and 97% of freight traffic.4 The road density, defined as ratio of road area to \nadministrative area, is 10.7% in the Colombo municipal council, which is better than in other \ncongested Asian cities such as Bangkok (7.1%) or Jakarta (7.3%) but lower than in other major \ncities such as Tokyo (16.3%), Seoul (13.6%), and Shanghai (12.3%).5 The number of vehicles \ncoming to the city has increased to nearly 300,000 per day. Total person-trips are projected to \n                                                \n1  Along the route, a dedicated ramp to the port will be constructed for port-related traffic. \n2  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 2014.

Per capita income in 2016 was \n$3,850.

Tokyo. \n ", "2 \nincrease 2.3 times from 2013 to 2035.6 The road network needs to be further developed to \naccommodate the increasing traffic demand.7 \n \n5.  Traffic volume on major arterial roads is almost at capacity, which causes serious traffic \ncongestion throughout the city. The average traffic speed is less than 10 km per hour during peak \nhours at many intersections along major arterial roads, particularly between the north\u2013south \nBaseline Road and radial roads. Constructing new roads or widening existing ones, however, has \nbecome almost economically and socially unviable because of the potentially large scale of land \nacquisition and resettlement requirements. The congestion hindering efficient economic activities \nis a growing economic and social concern in Colombo. Without further intervention in transport \nprojects in Colombo, economic loss could reach about 3.5% of the Western Province\u2019s gross \ndomestic product by 2020.8 \n \n6.  Expansion  of  expressway  network.  The  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA)  has \nexpanded its expressway network since it opened the Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka\u2019s first \nexpressway, to traffic in 2011. The CKE has been in operation since 2013 and part of the Outer \nCircular Highway (OCH) has been in operation since 2014. The RDA will connect the three \nexpressways once the rest of the OCH is completed. The planned central expressway leading to \nthe OCH will also be part of the network. Connecting the rest of the country with Colombo through \nthe expressways will be essential for the development of the whole economy. However, without \nan efficient urban road network system, it will create additional traffic in the Colombo metropolitan \narea. The NKB, funded and implemented by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, links \nthe CKE to the proposed elevated highway. The NKB is scheduled for completion in 2021 and is \nclassified as collaborative cofinancing with the project, since it is part of the same plan of road \ndevelopment. \n \n7.  Insufficient logistics infrastructure to Colombo port. Colombo serves as the central \ntransport node between domestic and international logistics. At the northwestern edge of the city \nis Colombo port, Sri Lanka\u2019s main international port, which handled 5.7 million 20-foot equivalent \nunits (TEUs) of container cargo in 2016. During the same year, the port handled about 1.3 million \nTEUs destined for or originating from Sri Lanka (25% of total containers handled), and this could \ndouble to 2.5 million TEUs in 2030 with Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth.9 The constrained site \nlocation forces the great majority of freight vehicles exiting and entering the port to pass only \nthrough the main gate on a four-lane, ground-level port access road.10 The existing port access \nroad leads to an intersection with Baseline Road, which is one of the busiest trunk roads in the \ncity.11 The cargo trucks, mostly through-traffic to and from areas outside Colombo city, have no \nchoice but to use the intersection, causing serious traffic congestion.12 The limited access route \nto the port, together with the national highway network radiating out from Colombo, creates the \nunnecessary concentration of through-traffic in the congested city. \n \n                                                \n6 Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development. 2016.

The volume is expected to exceed \n6,500 per day by 2030. \n11 About 300 freight vehicles per hour use Main Gate No. 6 (both directions) on Baseline Road during the daytime. \n12 The traffic origin\u2013destination survey in Colombo port shows that less than 10% of the containers originated from and \nwere destined for the Colombo municipal council. \n ", "3 \n8.  The project also includes improvement of customs practices. Sri Lanka\u2019s performance on \nindicators of trade facilitation is better than that of other countries in the region, but lags many \nSoutheast  Asian  economies.  Current  trade  logistics  procedures,  which  lack  a  modern  risk \nmanagement system and limit use of automated systems, lead to queuing of cargo traffic at the \nport and may hinder the elevated highway project from realizing the intended benefits (para. 25).13 \nIntegrating trade logistics facilitation with the road project will then reduce congestion not only on \nthe  surrounding  road  network  but  also  within  the  port,  addressing  the  key  physical  and \nnonphysical  barriers  identified  by  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation \nSecretariat  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study  for  Colombo  Port.14  The  project  will  (i) \nsignificantly enhance the port\u2019s capacity for expanding distribution services, (ii) provide better \nservices to port users, and (iii) help develop Colombo port into a logistics hub.15 \n \n9.  Challenges of traffic mobility in Colombo. Considering (i) the increasing traffic demand \nin a district with the most economic potential, (ii) further development of the expressway network, \nand (iii) the insufficient logistics infrastructure to the port, the transport sector faces the following \nmajor challenges: (i) alleviating the intensifying congestion in Colombo without large-scale land \nacquisition; (ii) efficiently managing the incoming traffic through the NKB from the expressway \nnetwork, while minimizing the burden on the existing road network in Colombo; and (iii) handling \nthe increasing freight traffic for Colombo port without causing congestion in the surrounding area. \nThe project will address these challenges by constructing the elevated highway within the port \npremises, which will enable the project to be implemented without considerable negative social \nimpact. Through the attached TA projects, it also aims to enhance institutional capacity for \nexpressway operation and to improve trade logistics efficiency. \n \n10.  Government development strategy. The government\u2019s development policy statement \nhighlights the strategic importance of Sri Lanka as a hub for global logistics and commercial \noperations.16 The government also emphasized that export development is a top priority, with \nmeasures  aimed  at  productivity  improvement,  trade  facilitation,  and  bilateral  economic \nintegration. The Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020 provides policy directions to facilitate \nthe country\u2019s economic growth by creating an efficient road network (footnote 4). Key strategies \nto achieve the policy are (i) providing efficient links between key economic centers and ports by \nextending the expressway network, and (ii) constructing an elevated road network to minimize \ntraffic congestion in the Colombo metropolitan area. The project is identified as a priority road \nproject in the Western Region Megapolis Master Plan (footnote 8). \n \n11.  ADB intervention. In line with the government\u2019s national strategy, the country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to address major constraints on \nSri Lanka\u2019s development through the following pillars: (i) strengthen the drivers of economic \ngrowth, and (ii) improve the quality of growth.17 The transport sector is one of the key areas where \nthe strategy will be implemented. For the first pillar, ADB places a high value on the provision of \ngrowth-oriented infrastructure, which includes regional cooperation, and is boosted by better \nconnectivity to Colombo port. Emphasis is also given to institutional capacity strengthening to \n                                                \n13  Inspection requirements for import cargo is a nonphysical factor that worsens heavy traffic at the intersections. \nDetails  are  in  Attached  Technical  Assistance  Report:  Supporting  Trade  Logistics  Facilitation;  and  Sector \nBackground: Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Secretariat. 2006.

Support for improving \ncustoms  practices  is  in  line  with  the  operational  priorities  identified  under  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan\u2019s strategic objective of enhancing trade \nfacilitation.18 Improved trade logistics will strengthen competitiveness and thus also aligns with \nthe country partnership strategy\u2019s thematic priority of supporting private sector development. \n \n12.  Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  involves  port-related  activities  and \nmultiagency coordination, including with customs, and requires government intervention. ADB \nassistance in the toll road and its linkage with the NKB will add value by strengthening the \ninstitutional capacity of the RDA in the operation of the expressway network. As all expressways \nwill become interconnected, the current project-by-project basis of tolling operation needs to be \nchanged. Among the challenges the RDA could face is the need (i) to develop a fair, consistent, \nand accountable toll rate policy; and (ii) to introduce a technically unified modern toll collection \nsystem. The attached TA for the Expressway Operations Improvement Project will support the toll \npolicy formulation, which aligns with lessons learned from past ADB interventions.19 The project \ndesign also includes an advanced technology of the the multi-lane free flow electronic toll \ncollection (ETC) with support from the loan and the attached TA to charge tolls without physical \ntollbooths. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s strong ties with the implementing agencies for road, port, and regional cooperation \nwill enable an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to the project. The Employer\u2019s detailed \ndesign has been prepared by the RDA under the Transport Project Preparatory Facility, and the \nproject has been fully reviewed by ADB\u2019s TA for the National Port Master Plan to conform with \nfuture port development plans.20 The project requires coordination between the Sri Lanka Ports \nAuthority (SLPA) and the RDA for its location inside the port, where ADB has played a critical \nnodal role. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s comprehensive approach in facilitating trade logistics under the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation will enhance the value of the project. TA support \nfor efficient trade logistics through customs modernization will contribute to improved economic \nefficiency. The TA also supports an innovative technology of electronic cargo tracking system to \nmonitor real-time container movement. Leveraging information and communications technology, \ncustoms practices, and maritime operations will be further integrated with trade logistics. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: economic growth and regional trade and \ncooperation of the country facilitated (footnote 4). The project will have the following outcome: \ntransport efficiency along the project road increased.21 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Elevated toll highway and related infrastructure constructed, upgraded, \nand installed. About 5.3 km of elevated toll highway between the NKB and Galle Face with a \nramp to the port and related facilities will be constructed and installed.22 An advanced ETC system \n                                                \n18  ADB. 2016.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n24.  Two attached TA projects are proposed (i) to improve expressway operations capacity, \nand (ii) to support trade logistics facilitation. The expansion of the expressway network will require \na fair, consistent, and accountable toll policy, and a modern and unified collection system. The \ncurrent toll rate policy and toll collection system were developed on a project-by-project basis, \nresulting in differing toll rates and collection systems among expressways. The TA for the \nExpressway Operations Improvement Project will assist in developing a new accountable toll rate \npolicy to address the long-term operational sustainability of the expressway network and support \na newly introduced ETC system by creating an enabling policy environment and strengthening \nthe RDA\u2019s information and communications technology capacity.28 \n \n25.  Current trade logistics procedures may prevent the project from maximizing its economic \nand social benefits, particularly (i) the high inspection rate of about 80% for import goods, (ii) the \nlack of a real-time cargo tracking system, and (iii) the location of customs inspection facilities \ninside Colombo that create unnecessary traffic congestion. Without improving these procedures, \nintersections on trunk roads will continue to be heavily congested. The TA for Supporting Trade \nLogistics Facilitation will assist in (i) improving the risk management system of customs to reduce \nthe inspection rate, (ii) preparing a study for a new customs inspection facility, and (iii) preparing \nthe technical design and business case for using an electronic cargo tracking system.29 \n                                                \n28  Attached Technical Assistance: Expressway Operations Improvement Project (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n29  Attached Technical Assistance: Supporting Trade Logistics Facilitation (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n26.  Expressway Operations Improvement Project. The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, \nof which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. The RDA will be the implementing agency for the TA, which \nwill be implemented from October 2018 to September 2023 with 50.5 person-months of consultant \ninputs (10.0 international, 40.5 national). The project team will recruit a consulting firm and \nindividual consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n \n27.  Supporting Trade Logistics Facilitation. The TA is estimated to cost $1,437,500, of \nwhich $1,250,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and \nother in-kind contributions. The Sri Lanka Customs Department will be the executing agency for \nthe TA, which will be implemented from December 2018 to November 2020 with 66 person-\nmonths  of  consultant  inputs (24  international, 42  national).  The  project team  will  recruit  a \nconsulting firm and individual consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff \ninstructions. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  The project team considered the alignment and elevated concrete box girder structure as \nthe best among the proposals it reviewed during project preparation in terms of land acquisition, \nthe number of affected SLPA facilities, current and future port operation requirements, climate \nresilience, and economic feasibility and sustainability. The Employer\u2019s detailed design has been \nprepared by the RDA under the Transport Project Preparatory Facility (footnote 20). The design \nconsiders future extensions to Marine Drive along the coastline and to Pettah to address future \ntraffic demand generated by ongoing urban developments. The RDA adopted a higher standard \nof vehicle loading for heavy cargo traffic. The RDA will secure a minimum vertical clearance of 10 \nmeters from the ground level for the port operation, which will also increase resilience to climate \nchange risks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis of the project follows ADB guidelines and \ncompares life cycle costs in with- and without-project scenarios, using a 9.0% discount rate and \nthe economic internal rate of return decision criteria.30 The project will cater to traffic, including \ncargo trucks, destined for the port. Quantified benefits include savings in vehicle operation costs \nand travel time, as well as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated to be 14.0%.31 Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the project. \n \n30.  Financial analysis. The project is revenue generating as a toll road. The RDA conducted \na financial analysis on an incremental basis using the discounted cash flow method and calculated \nthe financial internal rate of return following ADB guidelines. Capital costs include the construction \nof the elevated highway and the toll collection system. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \ninclude routine and periodic maintenance as well as operational costs of the tollway. The financial \ninternal rate of return is 2.11%, which is above the estimated weighted average cost of capital of \n1.01%. The cash flow projections indicate that the project will generate sufficient resources to \nmeet its O&M costs. \n                                                \n30  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n31  Excluding carbon dioxide emissions savings, the economic internal rate of return is 13.9%. \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  Policy,  legal,  and  institutional  capacity.  The  Ministry  of  Highways  and  Road \nDevelopment (MOHRD) and the Ministry of Ports and Shipping (MOPS) will act as executing \nagencies. They will formulate the policies and monitor the performance of the road and port \nsubsectors. The RDA, the implementing agency for road facilities under the road development \ncomponent, was established as a statutory authority with independent legal status through the \nRoad Development Authority Act, 1981. The SLPA, the implementing agency for port facilities \nunder  the  road  development  component,  was  established  as  a  statutory  authority  with \nindependent legal status under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, 1979. The executing and \nimplementing  agencies have  sufficient  capacity  and  experience  to  procure  civil  works  and \nequipment, select consultants, and administer contracts. Implementation of the advanced ETC \nsystem will be fully supported by project management consultants. The RDA has adequate \ncapacity for the O&M of expressways. However, private sector participation will be brought into \nthe operation of the new ETC system, through a service agreement, to improve toll operation \nefficiency.32 The Sri Lanka Customs Department will be the executing agency of the TA for \nSupporting Trade Logistics Facilitation. \n \n32.   Financial management. The RDA and the SLPA have prior and ongoing experience in \nimplementing ADB-funded projects. Assessments of the RDA and the SLPA found that the \nfinancial  management  risk  is  moderate,  mainly  because  of  staffing  and  internal  audit \narrangements. The RDA and the SLPA have project accounting and finance teams with suitably \nqualified accountants. The implementing agencies will establish and maintain separate project \nrecords and accounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made for the \nproject, thus ensuring an adequate audit trail. The government\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department \nwill audit project accounts and financial statements annually following international auditing \nstandards. \n \n33.  Procurement and anticorruption measures. The implementing agencies have shown \nsatisfactory performance in procurement under ADB-funded projects; the procurement risk is \nassessed as moderate. Procurement of works, equipment, and consulting services will follow the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The civil works contract for the elevated \nhighway is under procurement; concurrently, the RDA is recruiting construction supervision \nconsultants. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the executing and implementing agencies. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty and social. Colombo district has a population of 2.3 million and is home to 48.7% \nof Sri Lanka\u2019s urban population. The smooth flow of goods and people in the port area is a key \ncomponent to developing the country\u2019s high-value-added economy. Increased port efficiency will \nindirectly benefit those living in Sri Lanka through reduced shipping costs. At the local level, \nbeneficiaries will include transport providers and businesses (including locally run businesses) \nsupporting construction and port operations. \n \n35.  Gender and development. The design of the maritime facilitation center and other \nphysical infrastructure will include gender-inclusive features, such as women\u2019s washrooms on \nevery  floor,  and  other  design  features  that  may  benefit  female  workers  or  help  raise  the \n                                                \n32  The Expressway Operation Maintenance and Management Division of the RDA has operated and maintained 171 \nkm of expressways since 2011. \n ", "10 \npercentage of female workers in the SLPA. \n \n36.  Health and labor. The project team will make sure the contractor includes provisions for \npromoting awareness and preventing the spread of communicable diseases, including sexually \ntransmitted infections. The contractor will conduct semiannual awareness-building sessions for \nall  workers in a form and language understandable to them.  The construction supervision \nconsultants will monitor the sessions. The contractor will display awareness-raising materials in \nstrategic areas of the port. The civil works contractor will follow national core labor standards. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n38.  Environment (category B). The project expects no significant irreversible environmental \nimpacts. The  RDA  has  prepared  initial  environmental  examination reports for  the  highway \nconstruction  and  the  maritime  facilitation  center.34  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  are \nrestricted to the project construction stage and entail typical issues related to road or building \nconstruction such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, and waste from construction sites; and \noccupational health and safety. The most sensitive impact expected during construction is \npotential noise and vibration impacts on old historic buildings along the elevated road alignment. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  which  forms  part  of  the  initial  environmental \nexamination,  incorporated  mitigation  measures  to  address  all  expected  impacts,  including \nstringent measures to control and monitor noise and vibration levels. The EMP will be included in \nthe bidding documents and implementation by the contractor is mandatory. The RDA held \nconsultations with stakeholders, such as local government officials and utility agencies, during \nproject preparation and will continue to hold them during project construction. A grievance redress \nmechanism will be in place to address the concerns of any individual or agency during project \nimplementation. The RDA\u2019s Environment and Social Safeguard Division will monitor overall \nmanagement and implementation of environmental safeguards under the project. The contractor \nand the construction supervision consultants will also include an environment specialist to ensure \nproper EMP implementation and monitoring. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). For all project outputs \ninvolving civil works, thorough due diligence confirmed that the project will be implemented within \nthe existing secured port area and port-owned land. The government owns the project site, no \ntitleholders or non-titleholders occupy the area, and no private structures will be affected. The \nRDA held consultations with stakeholders during project preparation. Due diligence found that the \nproject will have no impact on livelihood and indigenous peoples. The social development \nspecialist of the project supervision consultant will perform annual monitoring to verify that there \nare no impacts during implementation and that information disclosure and consultation are \ncontinued throughout the construction period. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n33  ADB.
