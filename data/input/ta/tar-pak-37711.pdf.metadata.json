Reducing  rural  poverty  is  a  key  objective  of  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB) \ndevelopment assistance to Pakistan. ADB has historically provided the largest proportional \nshare  of  its  lending  assistance  for  Pakistan\u2014about  29%\u2014for  agricultural  and  rural \ndevelopment. From 1990 to 2001, ADB supported 18 agriculture and rural development projects \nwith total assistance of $1,452 million. Under its 2002\u20132006 Country Strategy and Program \n(CSP) for Pakistan, and the recently approved Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) \nfor 2004\u20132006, ADB has maintained high priority on these sectors and has planned a number of \nrural development projects.  \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance (TA)1 grant on determinants and drivers of poverty \nreduction and ADB\u2019s contribution in rural Pakistan will be used to conduct a detailed study of the \nhigh levels of chronic and transitory rural poverty in Pakistan in order to identify appropriate \npolicy and implementation measures that could reduce such poverty on a sustained basis.  The \nTA was prepared during a fact-finding mission from 3-24 November 2003.  The mission reached \nan agreement with the Government on the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, financing, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Rural poverty rose sharply from 25% in 1990/91 to 39% of the rural population in \n2000/01,2 whereas poverty in urban areas fell from 27% to 23% of the urban population over the \nsame period. The rural-urban gap in social indicators increased significantly during the 1990s. \nParadoxically, reasonably high agricultural growth in the 1990s was associated with increased \nrural poverty.3  \n \n4.  In  addition,  the  phenomenon  of  transitory  poverty\u2014households  that  have  mean \nexpenditures above the poverty line but whose expenditure levels fall below the poverty line a \ndefined number of times\u2014 is estimated to be quite high in rural areas. According to a study \nbased on 5-year panel data, nearly three-quarters of rural households face transitory poverty. \nThis study also found that smoothing of incomes across just 2 years resulted in a 66% drop in \ntransitory poverty.4  \n \n5.  Researchers have found that the rural poor (i) lack access to adequate land, water, and \nfinance; (ii) have little human capital; and (iii) encounter limited employment opportunities in \nrural areas. The rural poor are, however, not homogeneous in terms of their natural, social, or \neconomic environments; severity of poverty; or their sources of income.  A vast majority are \nsmall landowners, sharecropping tenants, and landless laborers. Some are highly dependent on \nagriculture, but others have diversified their income sources since they are unable to meet their \n                                                           \n1 The technical assistance (TA) grant first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 October \n2003.  The concept paper of the TA was approved on 8 October 2003. \n2 Please see Ministry of Finance. 2003. Economic Survey 2002\u201303. Islamabad, for the official data on poverty, \nassociated social indicators and income distribution during the 1990s. The rural poverty level is estimated based on \nan official poverty line of 2,450 calories per adult equivalent per day.    \n3 In order to resolve this paradox it is necessary to examine the changes in rural income distribution, urban and rural \nreal  wage  rates,  rural  and  urban  employment  levels,  prices  of  farm  inputs  and  outputs,  landlessness,  and \nfluctuations in agricultural output because of the weather. \n4 McCulloch, Neil and Bob Baulch. 1999.Distinguishing the Chronically from the Transitorily Poor: Evidence from \nRural Pakistan, IDS Working Paper 97. Brighton:University of Sussex.   ", "2 \nbasic  needs  through  agriculture.  The  move  away  from  agriculture,  resulting  in  the  rapid \nmigration of people to urban areas, reflects the interaction of several factors, including access to \nland, water, and credit; land degradation; population growth; technological change; public policy \nand programs; and market forces. High persistent poverty damages the fragile resource base \nand the environment of all poor people in general, but it victimizes women more than men and \nchildren more than adults at the household level. \n \n6.  In the process of conceptualizing this TA, a background paper was commissioned to \nreview existing evidence on agricultural growth and rural poverty.5 The paper, which was based \non a review of some 66 studies and data sources, pointed out various data gaps, and concluded \nthat while there were several studies on determining the level of poverty and other studies on \nagricultural growth and productivity, there had been no systemic attempt to establish linkages \nbetween poverty and agricultural growth. The paper also concluded that there were even fewer \nstudies  specifically  on  the  nonfarm  rural  sector  and  the  relationship  between  changing \nsocioeconomic dynamics in rural areas and poverty incidence. A comprehensive study of rural \npoverty is thus necessary to identify the major characteristics of Pakistan\u2019s rural poverty and the \nunderlying causes of high levels of both chronic and transitory poverty. Such a study is also \nneeded to assess the impact of various interventions to reduce rural poverty. By focusing on the \nmajor drivers of poverty reduction in rural areas, the outputs of the proposed project will assist in \nimplementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was finalized in December \n2003. It will also help guide and inform future PRSP updates. The proposed project will also \nhelp  ADB  implement  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  design  its  poverty  reduction \ninterventions,  both  in  Pakistan  and  in  the  region.  More  generally,  it  will  contribute  to  the \nknowledge  base  and  learning  on  rural  poverty  issues  and  will  benefit  the  planning  and \nimplementation of poverty reduction operations of other development agencies and the civil \nsociety\u2014nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and rural support programs (RSPs)\u2014involved \nin promoting sustainable livelihoods in rural Pakistan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The goal of this TA is to help reduce rural poverty in Pakistan on a sustained basis.  The \npurposes of the TA are to identify the major determinants of rural poverty, and to propose \nrecommendations on public policy and project focus in designing rural poverty interventions by \nthe Government, ADB, other development agencies, and NGOs/RSPs. The TA\u2019s scope includes \n(i) analyzing the relationship between agricultural growth and rural poverty to prioritize future \nagriculture-related interventions, while taking into account the role of subsectors (e.g. livestock, \nforestry, fisheries) in reducing the socioeconomic vulnerability of the rural poor; (ii) analyzing the \nlink between rural poverty and transformation of the rural economy, and recommending nonfarm \ninterventions and employment generation that would benefit the rural poor; (iii) analyzing the \nlinks between rural poverty, prevailing social structures, and access to social services; (iv) \nassessing the role of governance-related and institutional factors in perpetuating or reducing \npoverty; and (v) assessing the effectiveness of interventions for rural poverty reduction and \nsocial  safety  net  programs  of  the  Government,  ADB,  other  development  agencies,  and \nNGOs/RSPs; and (vi) identifying interventions having the greatest impact.  \n \n                                                           \n5 Malik, Sohail Jehangir. 2003. Agricultural Growth and Rural Poverty in Pakistan. Islamabad: ADB (prepared under \ncontract with ADB,Pakistan Resident Mission).   \n ", "3 \n8.  The outputs of the research project will include (i) a database on rural poverty profiles \nand determinants, comprising already available studies and data as well as studies completed \nand data collected under the TA; (ii) documentation of lessons learnt and successful practices; \n(iii) a comprehensive report highlighting the main findings and policy recommendations; and (iv) \n4 policy papers in the areas identified in para. 10, with the specific topics to be identified during \nTA implementation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA research has been divided into four major areas in an effort to describe the \nmultidimensional nature of rural poverty, to analyze the complex interaction between its causes, \nand  to  provide  analytical  clarity.  Gender  and  the  environment\u2014issues  that  cut  across  all \naspects of poverty and drivers of poverty reduction\u2014will be included in each area. \n \n10.  The first research area is the economics of rural poverty. It will emphasize (i) linkages \nbetween agricultural growth and rural poverty; (ii) household economies of the poor, including \nintrahousehold disparities by gender, age, and work status; (iii) the structural transformation of \nthe rural economy and the importance of nonfarm income sources and employment generation \nin reducing rural poverty; (iv) the economic impact of migration; and (v) resource management \nat the household and community levels, with a focus on gender and the environment. The \nsecond is social structures and access to social services for the poor, focusing on (i) the cultural \ncontext and social structure and its relationship with rural poverty; (ii) intrahousehold relations \nby gender and age; (iii) access and entitlements of the rural poor to assets, finance, physical \ninfrastructure, and social services such as education, health care, water supply, sanitation, and \nsafety nets. The third is the impact of governance and institutional factors on rural poverty, \nincluding (i) issues related to transparency, rule of law, and corruption in public services and \ntheir impact on the rural poor; (ii) impact of decentralization and devolution; (iii) participation in \ndecision-making; and (iv) impact of agricultural support prices and rationalization of agricultural \nsubsidies. In the fourth area, the focus will be on assessing effectiveness of interventions for \nrural poverty reduction and social safety net programs, including programs and projects of the \nGovernment,  ADB  projects,  projects  funded  by  other  development  agencies,  RSPs,  and \nprojects implemented by NGOs and civil society. Particular emphasis will be on implementation \ncapacity  and  mechanisms,  sustainability  of  interventions,  and  impact  of  interventions  on \nintended beneficiaries. \n \n11.  A comprehensive analysis of these areas will involve several steps. The first will be a \ndetailed review and analysis of available quantitative and qualitative data and information to \nestablish the current state of knowledge on each area, including the crosscutting issues of \ngender and the environment. Preliminary conclusions will then be drawn. The collected data and \ninformation will also be compiled into a database on rural poverty that will serve as a reference \nfor future work on related policy issues. \n \n12.  The  second  step  will  be  identifying  gaps  in  existing  data  and  information  and,  if \nnecessary, collecting primary data on a purposive sample basis from rural households and \ncommunities. New data collection will address specific research questions posed under the TA \nthrough focusing on geographical clusters where evidence for a particular phenomenon (such \nas role of off-farm employment and incomes in rural poverty reduction) could be found. The \nresults of the sample survey will be analyzed to supplement existing knowledge for changes in \n ", "4 \npublic policy and programs. As required, information and data will also be collected from primary \nsources for assessing the effectiveness of poverty reduction projects, including those assisted \nby ADB, others development agencies, the Government, and NGOs/RSPs. \n \n13.   The third step will interpret results and develop specific recommendations on designing \nand implementing poverty reduction policies, programs, and projects. \n \n14.  The  above  three  steps  will  constitute  the  TA\u2019s  first  phase.  Two  workshops  will  be \norganized in Islamabad during this phase. The first workshop will take place after the review of \ndata and literature in the four areas, with the purpose of sharing preliminary conclusions with \nstakeholders. The second workshop will follow the analysis and interpretation of the collected \nprimary data to again share findings and conclusions with stakeholders, and to obtain feedback \nand input for finalization of the TA reports. \n   \n15.  In  the  TA\u2019s  second  phase,  research  results  and  recommendations  will  be  given  a \npractical shape and disseminated through policy papers (para. 8).  A workshop will also be \norganized in Islamabad to share research findings and policy papers with stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, $130,000 of it in foreign \ncurrency and $370,000 in local currency. The TA will be administered by ADB and financed on a \ngrant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for $400,000 equivalent (the entire \nforeign currency costs and $270,000 in local currency costs). The Government\u2019s contribution of \n$100,000  equivalent  in  kind  will  include  office  space,  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  and \nlogistical  support  for  meetings,  workshops,  and  seminars.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  a \nfinancing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Finance (PRSP secretariat). An \nadvisory committee will be created and headed by the Ministry of Finance. Other members of \nthe advisory committee will include representatives from the Planning Commission, the Ministry \nof Food and Agriculture, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Center for \nPoverty Reduction and Income Distribution, provincial Planning and Development Departments, \nas well as representatives from selected research institutions, RSPs, and other civil society \ninstitutions. Technical Groups will be constituted for each of the four research areas to provide \ntechnical guidance and peer reviews to support the research carried out under the TA.  \n18.  The TA will be carried out over 18 months, beginning in February 2004 and ending in \nJuly 2005. There will be a total input of 27 person-months of consultancy, of which 6 person-\nmonths will be international and 21 person-months domestic. The consulting team will include \nan international consultant, who will be a rural economist (rural poverty specialist)/team leader \n(6 person-months). Domestic consultants will include a social structure and services specialist \n(4 person-months), a specialist on issues of governance and institutions (4 person-months), a \nproject specialist for assessment of interventions (6 person-months), a gender specialist (3.5 \nperson-months),  and  an  environmental  specialist  (3.5  person-months).  ADB  will  engage \nindividual consultants according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Individual \nconsultants are proposed because it is difficult to find the broad range of expertise required in a \nsingle  consulting  firm.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3. \nProcurement of equipment under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n ", "5 \n19.  The consultants will submit four reports. The outline inception report will be submitted \nwithin 1 month of fielding consultants. A report containing a review and assessment of the \nexisting literature (data and information) and proposed work plan (fieldwork and analysis), will \nbe  submitted  2  months  after  the  submission  of  the  inception  report.  A  workshop  will  be \norganized and facilitated by the consultants at this stage, with assistance from the PRSP \nsecretariat and ADB, to share the findings of the literature review and research plan with \nstakeholders.  A  full  research  report,  including  the  analysis  and  interpretation  of  collected \nprimary data and recommendations, will be submitted 9 months after the report on literature \nreview and work plan.  A second workshop will be organized and facilitated by consultants to \ndiscuss and share preliminary research findings.  The final 6 months of the TA will comprise the \nsecond phase in which policy papers on topics identified in the full research report will be \nprepared and disseminated through a third workshop. A final report of the TA, which will be a \ncompilation of the finalized versions of previous TA reports and policy papers, will be submitted \nwithin 6 months after the full research report. ADB will undertake regular reviews of progress on \nTA implementation. Tripartite review meetings involving ADB, the PRSP secretariat, and the \nconsultants will be convened as needed. \n \nIV.
