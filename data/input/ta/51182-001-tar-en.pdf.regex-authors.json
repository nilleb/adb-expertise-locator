The proposed National Solar Park Project will support the expanded deployment of solar \nphotovoltaic power plants in Cambodia, and address the country\u2019s need to: (i) expand low-cost \npower generation; (ii) diversify the power generation mix with an increase in the percentage of \nclean energy, in line with its stated greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets; and (iii) expand \nthe use of competitive tenders and other global best practices in the sector. The project will \nsupport the national electricity utility, Electricite du Cambodge (EDC), in constructing a 100 \nmegawatt (MW) capacity  solar power park (comprising civil  works including access roads, \nfencing, and drainage systems) and associated substation in Kampong Chhnang Province and a \ntransmission interconnection system to the Phnom Penh demand center to supply power to the \nnational  grid. 1  Through  a  transaction  advisory  services  agreement  between  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership and EDC, the project also aims to \nassist EDC to design and conduct a competitive tender for procuring the first private sector-led \nsolar power plant within the park.2 \n \n2.  The impact will be that the cost of electricity in Cambodia is lowered, as reflected in the \nCambodia Industrial Development Policy 2015\u20132025.3 The outcome will an increase in private \nsector investments in solar photovoltaic plants facilitated. The outputs will be (i) solar park and \ntransmission  interconnection  constructed,  and  (ii)  capacity  of  EDC  in  solar  power  plant \nconstruction and operation, project design and supervision, grid integration, and competitive \nprocurement  strengthened.  The  indicative  amounts  of  the  proposed  program  are  (i)  a \nconcessional loan of $7,640,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB, (ii) a concessional \nloan of $11,000,000 provided by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF),4 and (iii) a grant of $3,000,000 \nprovided by SCF. The government will provide counterpart financing of $2.94 million to finance \ntaxes and duties (through exemptions) and EDC will provide financing of $2.13 million for land \nacquisition and resettlement costs. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Cambodia has long been reliant on large hydropower and coal power plants contracted \nthrough unsolicited bids and business-to-business deals with independent power producers that \ninclude long-term, take-or-pay arrangements. This has left the government with sub-optimal \nsolutions for clean and affordable electricity for its citizens. At the same time, Cambodia\u2019s solar \nresource potential is one of the highest in the region, and studies have shown that solar-based \nelectricity generation could complement Cambodia\u2019s existing hydropower by helping to meet \ndaytime  peak  demand  and  improving  hydropower  performance  during  the  dry  season. \nAdditionally, recent reductions in the cost of solar photovoltaic generation, coupled with the high \ncost of imported coal and the associated social and environmental impacts of large coal and hydro \nplants, is making solar photovoltaic generation more attractive to the government. \n \n                                                \n1  The project is included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n2  The solar power plants will be tendered to private developers in two phases. The first phase will be for 60 MW. The \nsecond phase will procure the remaining capacity for a total of 100 MW.   \n3  Government of Cambodia. 2015. Cambodia Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025: Market Orientation and \nEnabling Environment for Industrial Development. Phnom Penh. \n4  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the SCF. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  The Government of Cambodia has been considering solar photovoltaic generation as an \nalternative to large hydropower and coal-fired power plants since 2013, following a pre-feasibility \nstudy on the development of a 100 MW solar power project, supported by the Ministry of Trade, \nIndustry and Energy of the Government of Korea,5 in partnership with ADB.6 The study indicated \nthat the cost of electricity from a solar photovoltaic plant in Cambodia would be around $0.12 per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) compared to EDC\u2019s average generation cost of $0.157/kWh (in 2014) from \ndiesel power plants. In February 2016, the government tendered a 10 MW solar plant at Bavet in \nSvay Rieng Province.7 The project, financed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department, \nwas commissioned in October 2017. The price of electricity to the grid by the winning bidder was \n$0.091/kWh compared to EDC\u2019s generation cost of $0.145/kWh (in 2015) from diesel power \nplants. Building on the success of this project, the government, with ADB support, is currently \ndeveloping a 100 MW capacity solar park. Construction of the first power plant in the solar park \nwas tendered to private developers in February 2019. The government formally requested \nfinancing for the project from ADB and requested ADB\u2019s assistance to access cofinancing for the \nproject through a combination of concessional loan and grant resources from the SCF. \n \n5.  ADB has also been assisting EDC to develop a solar generation master plan. In 2017, \nADB developed a preliminary national solar photovoltaic grid integration study and roadmap for \nEDC.8 In this study, low, medium and high solar penetration scenarios were considered. Results \nshow that with currently available technologies, 150 MW of solar can be added to the grid by 2020 \n(100 MW in Phnom Penh and 50 MW near other load centers in Cambodia), with no major impact \non the grid and no additional technical upgrades to the existing transmission system required. \nFollowing this study, in June 2018, ADB completed a country-wide solar generation master plan \nfor EDC that includes impacts and recommended actions to prepare the grid for solar penetration \nscenarios of greater than 1,000 MW by 2030.9 The plan has identified additional solar park \nlocations that could replace fossil fuel generation capacity that would be needed through 2030. \nCambodia is also developing regulations for rooftop solar and contemplating the development of \nfloating solar power plants. \n \n6.  The integration of variable renewable energy into the power system contemplated under \nthese scenarios requires knowledge of a wide range of technical issues and new technologies. In \nassociation with the loan-funded National Solar Park Project, the government has requested ADB \nto support a transaction technical assistance program to build capacity and knowledge regarding \nthe  development  of  solar  photovoltaic  technology,  solar  park  planning,  distributed  energy \nsystems, energy storage systems, grid codes for solar energy integration, and management of \ncorresponding challenges in the deployment of renewable energy, in order to manage the sharp \nincrease in solar power generation capacity anticipated in the country.  \n \n7.  For example, to support large-scale integration of renewable energy into its grid, EDC \nwould need to have access to the latest knowledge on energy storage technologies, which can \nhelp to better integrate Cambodia\u2019s electricity system and can play a crucial role in energy system \ndecarbonization by: (i) improving electricity system resource use efficiency; (ii) helping to integrate \n                                                \n5  The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy financed pre-feasibility studies in two countries (Afghanistan and \nCambodia) in 2012 on a grant basis. \n6   Korea Photovoltaic Industry Association; KC Cottrell Co., Ltd.; and Sun Business Development (for ADB and the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea, Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy). 2013.

Increased deployment of \nsolar  photovoltaic  generation  capacity  will  also  require  the  use  of  innovative  forecasting \ntechniques, advanced inverters, maximum power point tracking, and expanded information and \ncommunication technology applications. Ultimately, this knowledge will help Cambodia bolster its \nenergy security while also addressing its climate change goals.  \n \n8.  The proposed TA will help facilitate capacity building of EDC (the executing agency of the \nproposed National Solar Park Project).10). A targeted, medium-term training program will be \nimplemented over a 2-year period to cover all aspects of large-scale solar energy deployment, \nincluding siting, design, storage technologies, dispatch and grid management techniques.11 A \nseparate TA program is proposed to deliver a broad capacity development initiative that will help \nsupport the government in implementing the proposed project, and prepare the government for \nthe next phase of solar photovoltaic projects to achieve the national solar photovoltaic master \nplan, and to fully realize the solar photovoltaic potential in the country.12  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n9.  Output: The capacity  of  Electricite du Cambodge for integration of renewable \nenergy into the national grid, including adoption of advanced technologies such as energy \nstorage, strengthened. EDC will select up to six of their staff (including at least three women) to \nparticipate  in  a  specialized  and  intensive  training  course  on  solar  photovoltaic  and  grid \ntechnologies to be held at an appropriate research facility or utility in the Republic of Korea.13 The \nTA will provide specialized training and instruction in solar photovoltaic site planning and design; \ngrid codes for renewable energy integration; distributed energy systems, including solar pumping \nfor irrigation; energy storage technologies; selection of inverters; and maximum power point \ntracking and smart metering. The training will also include field visits to project and test sites. In \naddition, three workshops will be held in Phnom Penh on distributed energy systems, grid codes \nand energy storage technologies for a wider audience of EDC staff (with proportional participation \nof female staff).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 of which, $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. \nFund financing will not be used for (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale equipment, (iii) \npermanent staffing costs, or (iv) the hiring of staff consultants.
