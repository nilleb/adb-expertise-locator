INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will aid policy research and capacity \nbuilding  in  Yunnan  and  Guizhou  provinces  to  promote  sustainable  trade  and  investment \nfacilitation, as well as economic linkages, between the two provinces and the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS). For Yunnan, a road map will be prepared to improve its policy, regulations, \nand  institutions  to  facilitate  trade  and  investment  with  the  GMS  and  promote  sustainable \ndevelopment  by  integrating  environmental,  social,  and  governance  (ESG)  principles  in  the \nprovince\u2019s investment promotion activities. For Guizhou, the TA will assess its potential for \ndeveloping  economic  corridors  with  the  GMS,  and  initiate  innovations  in  green  finance \nmobilization to improve the financial and environmental sustainability of its infrastructure projects, \nincluding those that link it with Guangxi and Yunnan. \n \n2.  The TA will support the strategic objective of the 13th five-year plan, 2016\u20132020 of the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to further open up the country\u2019s economy \nand enhance the quality of its economic growth.1 The plan calls for the PRC to break new ground \nin strengthening cross-border cooperation, and Yunnan and Guizhou have been identified as \npivotal to doing so. The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020  and  Strategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priorities  to  enhance \nenvironmental sustainability and foster regional cooperation and integration.2 \n \nII.      ISSUES \n \n3.  Yunnan is an active participant in the GMS Economic Cooperation Program. Yunnan\u2019s \ntrade with the other five GMS countries grew by 5.6% in 2018. To reap the benefits of a continued \nexpansion and deepening of economic cooperation with the GMS, Yunnan needs to upgrade its \ncross-border trade and investment facilitation systems. Market access restrictions and unfriendly \nbusiness  processes  must  be  addressed.  This  requires  improvements  to  (i)  align  customs, \nimmigration, and quarantine border clearance processes with international best practices; (ii) \npromote cross-border trade in services and tourism to complement trade in goods; (iii) implement \nthe \u201cnational treatment\u201d provisions of the new Foreign Investment Law (FIL), 2020 for foreign \ninvestors; and (iv) establish governance mechanisms for investors that focus on transparency, \nfair treatment, and communication channels. Further, the coronavirus disease pandemic has \nhighlighted new challenges that must be addressed in the cross-border movement of goods and \npeoples. These include (i) health surveillance systems to contain and mitigate the spread of \ncontagious diseases, and (ii) food safety and security to avoid disruptions in the food supply chain \nand ensure the seamless flow of essential food commodities. \n \n4.  In 2019, Yunnan was designated a pilot free trade zone (FTZ) to boost the efficiency of its \neconomy. The province intends to use its FTZ status to modernize its trade and investment \nfacilitation systems and processes. Further, Yunnan needs to strengthen its capacity to implement \nthe PRC\u2019s FIL, which took effect in January 2020. The FIL mandates provincial governments to \npromote  an  open  and  transparent  business  environment  and  good  governance  to  ensure \nequitable treatment of foreign and domestic investors. Additionally, Yunnan will need to make its \neconomy more sustainable by integrating ESG principles in its investment promotion activities; \n \n1  Government of the PRC. 2016. 13th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020. \nBeijing. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a \nProsperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 September 2020. \n ", "2 \nthis is aligned with the national government requirement for ESG disclosures by publicly listed \ncompanies to ensure that private sector investments meet sustainable development standards. \n \n5.  Guizhou aims to take advantage of its proximity to the PRC\u2019s two GMS provinces\u2014 \nGuangxi and Yunnan\u2014to expand its economic connections with Southeast Asia. Given its rich \nnatural and environmental resources, Guizhou was chosen as a pilot green finance zone (GFZ) \nin 2017 to support the PRC\u2019s green transformation goals. Guizhou\u2019s role as a pilot GFZ obligates \nit to achieve stronger economic ties and cooperation with the GMS in ways that are sustainable. \nConsideration of regional public good (RPG) elements must be incorporated into the planning and \ndesign of connectivity infrastructure investments that it needs to undertake to expand economic \nlinkages with the GMS countries. These include the protection of the province\u2019s biodiversity and \nculture, ecological sustainability, and mitigation of health risks. \n \n6.  In line with its pilot GFZ status, Guizhou plans to mobilize green finance in innovative ways \nto improve the financial and environmental sustainability of its infrastructure projects, including \nthose that link it with Guangxi and Yunnan, and prospectively with the GMS countries and beyond. \nThe Guizhou Provincial Government has provided private financial intermediaries and investors \nwith practical incentives to expand green finance, such as direct subsidies and tax benefits. New \nprovincial guidelines were issued in 2016 to encourage financial institutions to play a part in \nbuilding the local green economy. However, the province still faces major challenges. It lacks the \ncapacity to adapt green finance policies to local conditions. It also needs to learn about green \nfinance best practices and ways to apply them to ensure that its infrastructure projects are \ndesigned and implemented in an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible way. \n \nIII.     THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable cooperation between the PRC\u2019s \nYunnan and Guizhou provinces and the GMS countries enhanced (footnote 1). The TA will have \nthe following outcome: sustainable trade and investment facilitation and cross-border connectivity \npolicies and initiatives enhanced.3 By 2024, policies, regulations, and institutions for trade and \ninvestment facilitation with the GMS based on the TA recommendations will have been adopted \nby  the  Yunnan  Provincial  Government.  It  is  also  envisaged  that  economic  and  transport \nconnectivity  initiatives  between  Guizhou  and  the  GMS  will  have  been  implemented,  and \nguidelines for mobilizing green financing for sustainable infrastructure will have been adopted by \nthe Guizhou Provincial Government. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Road map on sustainable trade and investment cooperation with Greater \nMekong  Subregion  for  Yunnan  prepared.  The  road  map  will  identify  obstacles  and  the \ncorresponding solutions in Yunnan\u2019s policy, regulations, and institutions to facilitate trade and \ninvestment cooperation with the GMS, covering the areas of (i) customs, immigration, and \nquarantine processes; (ii) cross-border movement of people for trade in services and tourism; (iii) \nFIL implementation to create equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors; and (iv) adoption \nof ESG principles and indicators by enterprises in the FTZ. The road map will be prepared through \na  combination  of  desk  research  and  consultations  with  the  central,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernment  stakeholders  to  reflect  their  inputs  and  foster  ownership  of  the  TA  project\u2019s \n \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nrecommendations. The TA project\u2019s recommendations on improvements in cross-border trade \nand investment facilitation, as well as innovative approaches to FIL implementation, will be \nsubmitted to the Yunnan Provincial Government. The road map will be published once endorsed \nby the provincial government. At least two innovations in trade and investment facilitation will be \npiloted with GMS countries. Guidelines on ESG disclosure for firms in the Yunnan FTZ will be \nprepared and disseminated. \n \n9.  Output 2: Infrastructure and economic linkages between Guizhou and the Greater \nMekong Subregion identified. The TA will assess the potential for creating economic corridors \nbetween Guizhou and the GMS by reviewing the province\u2019s ongoing and planned economic and \ntransport connectivity initiatives to determine how these may complement such economic corridor \ndevelopment. To strengthen Guizhou\u2019s capacity as a GFZ, the TA will develop guidelines for \nincorporating RPG and ESG considerations in the design of sustainable infrastructure projects for \nthe economic corridors to mobilize green finance. These will include protection of the province\u2019s \nbiodiversity and culture, ecological sustainability, and mitigation of health risks. A road map will \nbe prepared for Guizhou to guide its efforts to advance and improve on existing initiatives for \nmobilizing green finance, including for sustainable infrastructure projects. The road map will be \npublished once endorsed by the Guizhou Provincial Government. By identifying ways to mobilize \ngreen finance for infrastructure projects, the TA will help amplify environmentally responsible \ninvestment and environmentally sustainable connectivity between Guizhou and the GMS. \n \n10.  Output 3: Capacity, institutions, knowledge, and skills related to regional public \ngoods; environmental, social, and governance principles; and green finance in Yunnan \nand Guizhou provinces enhanced. The knowledge generated from the TA will be shared at \nlearning  and  knowledge-sharing  events  on  RPGs,  ESG  principles,  and  green  finance  for \nsustainable infrastructure that will be conducted to increase awareness and understanding of \nthese topics by Yunnan and Guizhou officials. The events will also serve as a platform for \nparticipants from the two provinces and the GMS to discuss mutually beneficial collaboration \ninitiatives. The TA will support training to prepare officials of the two provinces to implement the \nTA recommendations. The training for Yunnan  officials will focus on trade and investment \nfacilitation with the GMS, and that for Guizhou officials will focus on green financing for sustainable \ninfrastructure. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $450,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.4 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The provincial governments of Guizhou and Yunnan will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of the remuneration and travel expenses of counterpart staff; provision of government \ndata  and  studies  to  the  TA  consultants;  provision  of  meeting  rooms,  office  facilities,  and \ngeographic information system maps; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  As the TA has regional dimensions and involves two provinces, ADB will be the executing \nagency. The implementing agency for output 1 will be the Yunnan Provincial Government, \n \n4  Established by ADB.
