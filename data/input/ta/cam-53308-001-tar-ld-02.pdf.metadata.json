These  are  very  important  preconditions  to \nachieving the economic growth that would allow Cambodia to rise again and rebuild \nitself from the devastation that occurred during the Cambodian genocide between \n1975-79.  Meanwhile,  since  the  early  stages  of  economic  restoration  and  for  the \npurpose of building up human resource capacity and promoting the dignity of its \ncitizen, the Royal Government has been paying very close attention to various social \nprotection programs.  \nAfter peace was fully restored in 1998, Cambodia renewed its face with effort \nand positivity. The country has been successful in stepping on the path of building \nand  developing  every  different  economic  sector.  Cambodian  people  have  been \nenjoying the fruits of peace, political stability and rapid economic growth with an \naverage annual growth of 7.7% in the last two decades. The poverty rate fell from \n53% in 2004 to 13.5% in 2014. Moreover, the fruits of economic growth have become \nmore equitably distributed, reflected by the Gini coefficient which fell from 0.41 in 2007 \nto 0.29 in 2012 and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. These \nachievements are undeniable and serve as a pride for both the Royal Government \nand the Cambodian people. Especially, if one looks back at the social and economic \nsituation which the Royal Government inherited in 1979, the current achievements \nreflect a massive leap forward towards the fulfillment of our future objectives which \ninclude the acceleration of economic growth, the promotion of job opportunities and \nthe development of an equitable society via the implementation of the necessary \nreforms. In the past, efforts have been made to enact and implement various social \npolicies,  specifically  to  ensure  that  poor  and  vulnerable  people  receive  support \nthrough  the  establishment  of  orphanages,  facilities  for  people  with  disabilities, \nmaternal and newborn care centers, health services, subsidy to poor people who \nneed treatment or child delivery service, free primary and secondary education, etc. \nIn addition, the Royal Government established the National Social Security Fund for \nCivil  Servants  (NSSFC),  the  National  Social  Security  Fund  (NSSF),  the  National \nix \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nFund  for  Veterans  (NFV)  and  the  People  with  Disabilities  Fund  (PWDF),  to \nguarantee a stable income for citizens through pensions, healthcare, employment \ninjury  allowance,  disability  allowances  and  other  allowances.  These  activities  are \nconsistent with the poverty reduction policies and the Royal Government\u2019s socio-\neconomic development policies already established in other key policies, in particular \nthe Rectangular Strategies and the National Strategic Development Plan. \nThe  vision  and  aim  of  the  Royal  Government  is  to  increase  the  status  of \nCambodia to become an upper-middle income country by 2030 and a high-income \ncountry by 2050. In this context, the Royal Government strongly acknowledges that \nthe social protection system is a major contributor to \u201ceconomic growth with equity \nand inclusiveness.\u201d Being responsible for stable living conditions for its citizens, the \nRoyal Government has defined its long-term vision for the development of the social \nprotection  system:  \u201cthe  construction  of  a  social  protection  system  based  on \ninclusiveness, effectiveness and financial sustainability as a tool to reduce and prevent \npoverty, vulnerability and inequality and which will contribute to the development and \nprotection of human resources and stimulate economic growth\u201d. \n  In line with this vision and on the basis of political, macro-economic stability \nand an improved socio-economic development, there is no better time than now to \ndevelop a broad \u201cNational Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025\u201d (SPPF) \nfocusing on two main pillars, namely, Social Assistance and Social Security. \n   The goal of this policy framework is to develop a strategic plan for the Royal \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  to  ensure  income  security  and  reduce  economic  and \nfinancial vulnerability of its citizens. It will increase people\u2019s well-being and solidarity \nin  the  society  and  aims  at  reducing  poverty  to  a  maximum  extent.  The  policy \nframework  aligns,  concentrates  and  improves  the  existing  social  protection \nprograms/schemes  and  enhances  the  efficiency,  equity,  transparency  and \nconsistency of the social protection system as a whole. Depending on the country\u2019s \nlevel of economic growth, the current coverage, which is still considerably low, is \nexpanded  in  order  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  citizens  in  all  segments.  A \nframework on governance and cross-cutting issues will also be developed to ensure \nthe efficiency of the system and its budgetary implications. \nx \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n  The policy framework plays a crucial role in increasing the accessibility of \nsocial security and social assistance services for citizens in the public sector, the \nprivate  sector  and  the  informal  sector.  To  realize  the  new  vision  as  indicated  in \nCambodia\u2019s social protection system, the Royal Government will step-by-step set up \nnecessary programs and mechanisms to expand the coverage. At the same time, it is \nimportant to reform the social protection system, especially focusing on protecting \npoor and vulnerable groups and building the infrastructure necessary for ensuring \nefficiency and sustainability of the social protection system in the future. \n  To  ensure  the  ownership  of  this  essential  document,  the  SPPF  has  been \ndeveloped under the leadership and coordination of the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF) and in consultation with other stakeholders including: the Ministry of \nSocial Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSAVY), the Ministry of Labor and \nVocational  Training  (MoLVT),  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MoH),  the  Ministry  of  Civil \nService (MoCS), the Ministry of Planning (MoP), the Ministry of National Defense \n(MoND), the Ministry of Interior (MoI), the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Ministry of \nEducation, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) and the Council for Agricultural and Rural \nDevelopment (CARD).  \n  The implementation of the SPPF requires financial support, human resources \nand proper institutional arrangements, all of which are key challenges to be overcome \nby both policy-makers and the implementing agencies.

This \nhabit is still strong in the Cambodian society, especially among relatives and family \nmembers.  It  is  a  clear  sign  for  the  solidarity  in  the  family  and  community  of \nCambodian  society  and  is  something  worth  preserving.  Experiences  from  other \ncountries, especially those with similar customary practices to Cambodia, show that \nthose habits tend to fade away gradually from one generation to another, due to \nvarious factors. This trend suggests that a social protection system is indispensable \nto prevent every citizen from poverty, due to unforeseen negative events such as \nnatural disasters, healthcare costs, disability or old age. \nThe Royal Government pays close attention to the development of the social \nprotection system as indicated by the implementation of the NSSF, NSSFC, NFV and \nPWDF and through the adoption of the National Social Protection Strategy for Poor \nand Vulnerable which was the basis for implementing social assistance programs. \nth\nFor its 5  mandate, the Royal Government has set in-depth reform policy for all \nsectors which \u201cto strengthen and develop a consistent, coherent and effective social \nprotection system\u201d is set out as one of the key priorities in the National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2014-2018 and the Rectangular Strategy Phase III of the Royal \nGovernment. \nThe  Royal  Government  has  adopted  the  SPPF  with  the  aim  of  promoting  a \nstrong social protection system and providing resilient and better protection for every \ncitizen, especially poor and vulnerable. \nThe long-term vision is to build a social protection system which is inclusive, \neffective and financially stable to reduce and prevent poverty, vulnerability, inequality \nand to improve human resource development and to stimulate economic growth. \nThe aim of this policy is to formulate government strategies to ensure income \nsecurity and to reduce the economic and financial vulnerability of the people in order \nto promote well-being and solidarity as well as to reduce poverty to the maximum \nextent  possible.

Specific measures are set forth for the short, medium and long term horizon, \nall based on four key considerations: (i) equity, (ii) fiscal space, (iii) effectiveness, \n(iv) sustainability. \nThe future social protection system of Cambodia is divided into two parts: a \nSocial Assistance and a Social Security. The Social Assistance provides protection to \ncitizens who live below and near the poverty line, with special attention to children \nand  pregnant  women,  people  with  disabilities  and  elderly.  The  Social  Security \nprovides protection to citizens in both the formal and the informal sector who have \nsufficient income. \n1.2  Socio-Economic Situation \nth\nAccording to an assessment by the World Bank in 2015, Cambodia is ranked 6  \namongst countries with the fastest economic growth in the world. During the past two \ndecades, the annual average economic growth was around 7.7% and is expected to \nremain stable in the medium term.

The Royal Government has to support the social protection system through \nspecific policies or activities, including: (i) maintaining macroeconomic and financial \nstability,  (ii)  preparing  the  management  and  regulatory  framework,  (iii)  providing \nappropriate financing options and solutions for social protection activities. \nMacroeconomic and financial stability is the basis for social protection, especially \nby keeping the inflation low and income sustainable at a decent level. In this context, \nreducing the risks of financial crisis also means reducing the vulnerability of all citizens, \nparticularly of the poor. \nMoreover, social protection policies have to be consistent and closely linked with \neconomic and financial policies, are the main sector specific policies. These policies, \n7 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nwhich complement each other, will create a common framework to promote social \nwelfare and equity in a sustainable and inclusive economic development. Amongst \nothers, they include the national poverty reduction strategy, the development in the \nareas of education, healthcare, social solidarity, human resources, inclusive financing, \nenvironmental protection and natural disaster management as well as gender policies. \nPromoting  social  protection  requires  appropriate  funding.  Social  protection \nprograms and activities can be financed and implemented by the public sector, the \nprivate  sector,  development  partners,  civil  society  organizations  or  other  informal \nnetworks.  Support  from  development  partners  and  other  informal  networks  will \ndecrease  with  the  increasing  progress  of  the  national  economy.  Thus,  the  Royal \nGovernment will need to pay more attention on the sustainability of the funding of social \nprotection programs and activities. In consequence, social protection activities will be \nfinanced by two main sources: state budget and contributions (by employers, workers \nand employees and/or all citizens), while maintaining our culture and the traditional \nway of living in our society and families. \nThe Royal Government will launch the social protection system in a step-by-step \napproach in accordance with the progress of the economy and the society. However, \nthe support depends on its fiscal capacity which will be strongly impacted by the level \nof  benefits  foreseen  and  to  be  provided  to  eligible  citizens.  The  high  ambitions \nassociated  with  the  social  protection  system  will  lead  to  high  costs  which  do  not \ncorrespond  to  the  budgetary  capacity.  Mobilizing  more  revenue  to  support  social \nprotection  through  raising  inappropriately  high  taxes  would  discourage  domestic \ninvestment and does not promote economic activities, which ultimately will negatively \nimpact the overall economic growth. Hence, the social protection policy needs to reflect \nfiscal space, as well as the economic and political situation. \n1.4.3 Fundamental Principles of the SPPF \nWithin the context of intertwined financial and the eco-socio-political situation and \nto utilize the social protection system as an effective tool to achieve the long term vision \nand the specified aims, the social protection policies, strategies, programs and activities \nshould be based on the following key principles: \n \n1. Strengthen  the  leadership  role  (i.e.  the  Royal  Government\u2019s  roles  and \nresponsibilities in adopting policies and coordinating social protection programs \nand  activities,  as  well  as  monitoring  the  social  protection  system  at  national \n8 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nlevel); \n \n2. Appropriately  respond  to  the  needs  and  circumstances  as  identified  through \nstudies and analyses, in relation to demand, supply and relevant financing; \n \n3. Define acceptable contribution rates and satisfactory benefits to assure broad \nparticipation from the people; \n \n4. Ensure  a  sustainable  funding  based  on  budgetary  capacities  and  capacity \nbuilding of individuals, families and communities; \n \n5. Safeguard social equity and solidarity  to guarantee the reciprocal relationship \namong society members through income re-distribution mechanisms; \n \n6. Maintain  flexibility  and  responsiveness  to  adapt  to  changing  contexts,  which \nrequire the update of social protection strategies and policies in accordance with \nthe new circumstances. \n1.5  The SPPF for Cambodia \nThe SPPF covers both social assistance and social security. This comprehensive \napproach will provide for a framework linking and complementing the two systems.  \nThe Social Assistance foresees interventions for the poor and most vulnerable \npeople and subsidies from the national revenue such as taxes or ODA. The social \nassistance  system  in  Cambodia  is  divided  into  4  components:  (i)  emergency \nresponse,  (ii)  human  capital  development,  (iii)  vocational  training,  (iv)  welfare \nprovision to the most vulnerable people. \n The  Social  Security  includes  programs  and  schemes  that  aim  at  protecting \npeople from abrupt income declines due to illnesses, maternity, employment injury, \nunemployment, invalidity, old age (e.g. pensions) and death of breadwinner. In the \nCambodian context, the social security system is obligatory requiring its members or \ncertain groups of citizens to pay contributions based on their level of income. As a \nprinciple, the Royal Government provides subsidies for those who cannot afford to pay \nthe  contributions  on  their  own  behalf,  i.e.  poor  and  vulnerable  people. The  Social \nSecurity System in Cambodia  consists of 5 components: (i) pensions, (ii) health \ninsurance, (iii) work injury insurance, (iv) unemployment insurance, (v) disability \ninsurance.  \n \n \n9 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nFigure 9: Cambodia Social Protection Framework \n \n1.6  Life Cycle Approach of Social Protection System \nThe  main  challenges  for  the  development  of  the  social  protection  system  in \nCambodia are the lack of coverage for certain citizens and shortages in the ability of \nsome programs to respond to certain risks arising at specific stages in people\u2019s life. \nThese challenges create risks for the society as a whole and might drag people into \npoverty.  \nIn the Social Assistance, poor and vulnerable people receive health protection \nthrough the HEF, vocational training to increase their ability to find a job and work \nrehabilitation services focusing on people with disabilities.

However,  general  health  protection  for  civil  servants,  workers  and \nemployees as well as other groups of citizens has still to be established. Meanwhile, \nworkers, employees and citizens of other groups are not covered by any protection \nscheme when they retire or reach old age.

The evaluation shows that this program has increased the school enrolment rate \nof children from poor and vulnerable families. \n2.2.1.3   Primary and Secondary Education \nThe socio-economic development can be fostered as long as all children have \nequal  opportunities  to  education,  which  will  give  them  the  proper  employment \nopportunities and empower them to become responsible citizens. Currently, MoEYS \nimplemented scholarship programs at primary school level, which provide scholarships \nof 60 US-Dollars a year to 75,000 students in grades 4 to 6. Another 25,000 students \nreceive scholarships from WFP. Primary school scholarships encourage children from \npoor and vulnerable families to enroll on time. In addition, MoEYS has also provided \nscholarships to students from poor and vulnerable families at secondary education \nlevel in order to encourage youths to continue their education.  \n2.2.2  Challenges  \n2.2.2.1   Protection of Pregnant Women and Children \nWhile the quality of healthcare is strengthened, improving nutrition of pregnant \nwomen and children has seen no great progress, yet. The results of Cambodia\u2019s 2014 \nDemographic and Health Survey show that 32% of children under the age of 5 are \nstunted, 10% are wasted and 24% are underweight. Pregnant women and children \nunder the age of 5 in poor and vulnerable families are  vulnerable are particularly \nexposed to malnutrition due to a lack of financial resources, clean water, sanitation and \nan insufficient access to information on health and nutrition services.   \nAnother major problem is the lack of availability of proper pregnancy check-up. So \nfar, the Royal Government successfully encouraged women to give births at hospitals \nand  reduce the  practice of going to traditional midwives. However, the majority  of \nwomen in rural areas did not receive adequate healthcare and health check-ups during \ntheir pregnancy, yet. The main reasons are their lack of awareness and finance. \n2.2.2.2   School Feeding Program \nThe School Feeding Breakfast Program is to be implemented nationwide and its \nfinancing depends almost exclusively on development partners. Ensuring an efficient \nprogram management to improve children\u2019s health and encouraging them to enroll in \nschool is remains to be a major challenge. \n \n14 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n2.2.2.3   Primary and Secondary Education \nFinancial  problems  are  a  major  barrier  preventing  children  from  obtaining \neducation. Children from poor and vulnerable families are forced to drop out of school in \norder to work in the informal sector, which eventually leads to intergenerational poverty.  \nThe enrolment rate among children from poor and vulnerable families remains \nlow, while the drop-out rate is critically high. The primary school drop-out rate in the \n2013/2014 academic year was 10.5%, with late school enrolment as a main reason. \nThe scope of scholarship programs is still too narrow. Currently, scholarships are \nonly available for students in grades 4 to 6. Among these students, 50,000 more did \nnot receive any scholarship, yet. This shows that there is a need to widen the scope of \nthe programs, especially for students in grades 1 to 3 and to those at secondary \neducation level. \n2.2.3 Future Strategies and Goals \n2.2.3.1   Protection of Pregnant Women and Children  \nThe Royal Government will study the possibilities to implement a Cash Transfer \nprogram for children and pregnant women at national level, based on the result of the \ncurrent pilot projects. The critical element necessary in operationalizing this program is \nto define an operating body with a clear role and responsibility as well as capacity \nbuilding. \nThe program will be launched in selected priority provinces (those with a high \nfood insecurity rate) first. Evaluation mechanisms will be established to measure the \nsuccess of the program and its results will be the basis for further expanding the \nprogram to other provinces nationwide.  \nIn  addition,  to  promote  the  protection  of  women  and  children,  the  Royal \nGovernment  support  and  encourage  pregnant  women,  especially  those  from  poor \nfamilies,  to  receive  adequate  counselling  and  pregnancy  check-ups  to  protect  the \nhealth of the unborn children and pregnant women likewise.  \n2.2.3.2   School Feeding Program \nThe Royal Government will prepare an action plan and strengthen its human \nresource capacity to take over the management and financing of the School Feeding \nProgram by 2021. This vision is already envisaged in the \u201cRoadmap on School Feeding \nProgram\u201d. However, an evaluation and a comprehensive study on management and \nfinancing systems are necessary to assure its effectiveness prior to expanding the \n15 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nprogram. In the meantime, the Royal Government encourages the use of home-grown \nvegetables in the School Feeding Program to improve the quality of the nutrition of \nchildren. \n2.2.3.3   Scholarship Program in Primary and Secondary Education \nThe Royal Government will enact a national scholarship policy to determine a \nsuitable management mechanism to provide scholarships effectively at all education \nlevels to encourage children from poor and vulnerable families to enroll in school on \ntime  and  remain  in  school  until  they  finished  their  secondary  education.  A \ncomprehensive education is indispensable to prevent and avoid an intergenerational \npoverty trap. \n2.3  Vocational Training \n2.3.1 General Overview  \nThe result of the 2008 Census indicates that 65% of the people from 15 to 64 \nyears are actively working. A majority of the labor force is still of young age and every \nyear around 230,000 young people enter the labor market.  \nThe above statistics suggest high potential demands for vocational training to \nrespond  to  labor  market  specifies.  Vocational  training  is  a  key  factor  for  the \ndevelopment of the labor market. Young people with strong vocational skills have a \nhigher individual productivity and are likely to have more opportunities to get jobs with \nhigher payments. \nThe MoLVT conducted various skill training programs, including: (1) basic and \nhigh level skill trainings, (2) post-harvest techniques, (3) skill bridging trainings, (4) \nspecific trainings for people belonging to minorities people, (5) training programs for \npoverty reduction through the national fund, (6) trainings on entrepreneurship for \nfemale  workers  and  employees,  through  the  Samdech  Prime  Minister  Fund,  (7) \napprenticeship programs together with various enterprises. These vocational trainings \nrange from short term courses to tertiary levels. In the period from 2009 to 2013, about \n600,000 students graduated. \n2.3.2 Challenges \nThe low level of education attainment is the primary problem for young people \nentering the labor market due to their limited skills. To obtain specific technical skills, \nyoung people have to finish secondary level of education, at least. This level serves as \n16 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nthe basis for them to receiving vocational training and building up their potential in labor \nmarket. A further challenge arises from the mismatch between the trainings provided \nand the demands of the labor market, especially with regard to the need to quickly \ndevelop multiple skills to adapt to economic diversification. \n2.3.3 Future Strategies and Goals \nThe Royal Government will expand the scope of the existing vocational trainings, \nwith more focus on Skill Bridging Programs for school-dropped-out young people and \non the Voucher Skill Training Programs for poor people from rural areas enabling them \nto receive certified trainings. \nThe  Royal  Government  will  continue  to implement  cash  transfer  programs  to \nsupport vocational trainings with certificate levels 1-3 for the poor young people and \nwomen in priority sectors such as construction, mechanical maintenance, information \nand communication technologies (ICT), manufacturing and electronics.  \nMoreover, to promote young people\u2019s participation in the labor market, the Royal \nGovernment will consider allowing those who are already active in the labor market to \nacquire additional skills and experiences through trainings. \nTo  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  programs,  the  responsible \nministries have to have proper monitoring and evaluation mechanism.  \n2.4   Social Welfare of Vulnerable People \n2.4.1 General Overview   \nElderly and disabled people are considered most vulnerable because of their very \nlimited  opportunities  to  generate  income  and  receive  social  services,  while  having \nincreased need for nutrition supplements and healthcare. \nIn  2014,  people  of  65  years  and  older  accounted  for  about  5%  of  the  total \npopulation. But this figure is expected to rise, given the overall increase in average life \nexpectancy and other demographic changes. The number of people with disabilities is \nconsiderably high in Cambodia. In 2013, there were about 300,000 disabled people, an \nequivalence of 2% of the total population. \nIn general, women suffer more than men in old age. But men are more exposed \nto disability risks than women, due to various factors including land-mines, other un-\nexploded ammunition, war, accidents and work-related injuries. \n \n17 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n2.4.2 Challenges \n2.4.2.1  People with Disabilities \nPeople with disabilities, especially those living in poverty, tend to be discriminated \nand face problems, both in terms of physical conditions and financial situation. These \nproblems prevent them from receiving sufficient healthcare, education and vocational \ntraining services. Thus, they are not able to productively participate in the economy and \nreceive the related benefits. \n2.4.2.2  Elderly People \nIn Cambodia, as in other Asian countries, families and pagodas are the main \ninstitutions on which the elderly people depend. Although this form of traditional safety \nnets still exist, current social changes, both internal and external to the region, create a \nnew trend requiring elderly people to live by themselves. The reasons for this trend are \nmodernization,  especially  industrialization  and  urbanization.  In  a  situation  where \nhealthcare systems and pension systems are still under-developed, the trend puts the \nelderly at high risk of falling into poverty.  \n2.4.3 Future Strategies and Goals \n2.4.3.1  Cash transfer for people with disabilities \nThe Royal Government will continue to implement allowance schemes for people \nwith disabilities as indicated in the Sub-decree on Allowance for People with Disabilities \nat  Community  Level.  The  scheme  will  focus  on  people  with  disabilities  who  are \nmembers of households holding an ID poor card. \nThe benefits and conditions of the scheme will be determined by the availability/ \nfiscal space of the public budget. The design of the mechanisms to identify people with \ndisabilities is a key task to ensure the efficiency of the program. \n2.4.3.2  Elderly People Protection Program  \nThe Royal Government will assess possibilities to support elderly people who are \nmembers of poor households holding an ID Poor card. The benefits and conditions of \nthe programs will be determined based on the fiscal space.  \nThe program could be implemented as a family package together with the cash \ntransfer program for pregnant women and children. \n18 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nThe  Social  Assistance  System  is  the  mechanism  for  supporting  poor  and \nvulnerable people directly and indirectly. It is usually provided for by the state and \nfinanced  by  state  budget.  The  Social  Security  System  is  the  toolbox  of  different \ninstruments and is \u201cobligatory\u201d and \u201cself-dependent\u201d. It encourages citizens to seek \nprotection in the face of unforeseen social and economic crisis which can negatively \naffect  their  income  security  and  increase  their  vulnerability  to  illness,  maternity, \nemployment injuries, unemployment, disability, old age or death. The Social Security \nSystem is a contributory system which requires the participation from both employers \nand employees, in both public and private sector, retirees and people working in the \ninformal  sector.  The  Royal  Government  will  provide  full  subsidy  to  cover  the \ncontributions of poor and vulnerable people as well as for additional targeted groups \nas determined by the Royal Government and to the extent the national budget allows \nfor. Eligibility for full or partial subsidy will be assessed based on clear and appropriate \ncriteria in order to avoid \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. Potential \u201cmoral hazard\u201d may discourage \npeople from personal savings in order to protect themselves against unexpected risks \nor negatively impact their productivity. Therefore, the Royal Government will reduce its \nfunding  gradually  over  time  given  a  positive  socio-economic  development  for  the \naffected  citizens.  In  consequence,  social  security  schemes  will  continuously  be \nincreasingly financed by contributions and the investment return of the accumulated \nfund.     \n3.1  Pensions \n3.1.1 General Overview \nThe habit of personal saving for an individual\u2019s own old-age is not familiar with \nmost Cambodians. They rely on support from their children/grandchildren when they \nare old. This habit creates a high poverty risk to such individuals at old age. So far, only \ncivil  servants,  including  national  police  officers  and  soldiers,  who  serve  in  public \nsectors, around 7 per cent of the total population, receive retirement pensions. \nSome other institutions such as the National Bank of Cambodia, the Phnom Penh \nWater Supply Authority and the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port are managing own \npension  schemes  on  behalf  of  their  employees  but  without  any  proper  regulatory \nframeworks thereon.   \n19 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nThe pension schemes in Cambodia are organized separately for different targeted \ngroups. By adoption of the Royal Decree on Social Security Schemes for Veterans and \nthe Royal Decree on Social Security, the Royal Government created the National Social \nSecurity Fund for civil servants (NSSFC) in 2007 and the National Social Security Fund \nfor Veterans (NFV). The two funds manage pension schemes for retired civil servants \nand  veterans.  According  to  its  respective  regulation,  NSSFC  and  NFV  are  under \ntechnical supervision of the MoSAVY and financial control of the MEF.  \nThe pension schemes for civil servants and veterans under the NSSFC and NFV \nare fully funded by the state budget. In 2016, the Royal Government spent a total of \n556,346  million  Riels  (approx.  137  million  US-Dollars)  on  social  security  in  total \nwhereas  395,179  million  Riels  (approx.  98  million  US-Dollars)  were  spent  for  the \n106,633 pensioners who were civil servants and veterans. \nFigure 11: Expenditure on Pension Scheme from 2011 \u2013 2015 \n \nSource: Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth Rehabilitation \nThe Law on Social Security for Persons as defined by the provision of the Labor \nLaw established the  National Social Security Fund (NSSF) in 2007 as  the public \ninstitution responsible for managing the pension scheme for private employees.

Fragmentation among Operators \nThe current pension operators, NSSF, NSSFC and NFV have almost the same \nfunctions  and  responsibilities  for  their  respective  target  groups.

Inconsistency of Allowances/Benefits \nThe current pension allowances for civil servants, police officers and soldiers are \ninconsistent due to divergent laws and regulations. The pensions for civil servants are \nregulated by Sub-Decree no. 59, dated 06 October 1997 on the Implementation of a \nRetirement Pension Scheme and Invalidity Pension for Civil Servants in the Kingdom \nof  Cambodia.  The  pensions  for  police  officers  are  regulated  by  the  Law  on  a \nRetirement Pension Scheme and Invalidity Pension for Cambodian police. Pensions \nfor soldiers are regulated by the Law on a Retirement Pension Scheme and Invalidity \nPension for Soldiers in the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.

A Potential Sharp Increase of Expenditure \nThe annual expenditure for the pension schemes for civil servants and veterans \nincreased on average by 38.5% from 2010 to 2014. Currently, the Royal Government \nplans to raise salaries for civil servants to at least 1 million Riels from 2018 on.

Contribution Collection has not been implemented \nSo far, the Royal Government fully covered the actual pension expenditure.  Sub-\nDecree no. 73 dated 29 April 2011 on Contribution Rate Setting to support the National \nSocial Security Fund for Civil Servants requires civil servants to contribute 6% while \n18% come from public sources. However, the contribution collection based on the \nindicated  rates  has  not  been  implemented,  yet.  Therefore,  the  state  is  still  fully \nbearing the pension contributions for civil servants and veteran. The planned salary \nincrease  needs  to  be  considered  as  a  factor  for  implementing  the  foreseen \ncontribution split.  \n \nC. Demographic Change \nCambodia will face an aging society in the future due to an increase in life \nexpectancy  and  a  decrease  in  birth  rates.  These  factors  negatively  impact  the \n22 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nsustainability of pension schemes in the long run. This holds particularly true for the \ncurrent pension scheme which has been fully funded by the national budget through \na Pay-As-You-Go mechanism.  \n3.1.2.3  Legal and Regulatory Framework \nThe  existing  legal  instruments  provide  a  framework  to  operate  compulsory \npension schemes only. The supervision framework for the pension schemes, both in \npublic and private sector; do not fully meet current technical and financial sustainability \nstandards, yet. \nAt the same time, the early voluntary exit for civil servants (providing for an exit \nfrom labor life prior to what is foreseen by law) as well as  the level of benefits or other \nallowances  facilitating  such  a  voluntary  exit,  have  not  been  fully  considered  and \namended  to  reflect  social  changes  and  recent  developments  in  the  public \nadministration system.  \n3.1.3  Future Strategy and Goals \nThe long term vision for the pension system in Cambodia is to provide universal \ncoverage.  The  future  system  seeks  to  offer  financial  protection  at  old  age  to  all \nCambodian citizens. The respective mechanism should provide decent income to those \nwho participate in the compulsory and voluntary pension schemes and minimize the \npoverty risk when people, in both formal and informal sector, reach retirement age. The \nRoyal Government aims at creating a concentrated/integrated pension system based \non three principles: affordability, efficiency and sustainability.   \n3.1.3.1  Institutional Framework \n \nA. Ensuring Consistency between Public Pension Schemes \nIn the current phase, the Royal Government will develop guiding principles to set \nup mechanisms for revising the pension formula for public officials to gradually reduce \ngaps  among  pension  benefits  of  different  groups  of  public  servants.  A  permanent \nmechanism to ensure consistency of pension allowances for public officials will be \nforeseen by the Law on Social Protection System. The development of this regulation \nwill require further assessment and, thus, considerable time and effort. \n \nB. Alignment of Existing Pension Projects \nAs  mentioned  above,  managing  and  operating  pension  schemes  by  different \ninstitutions  is  a  key  barrier  for  professionalization  and  the  promotion  of  efficiency, \neffectiveness and operational cost reduction. To achieve consistency between benefits \n23 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nfor  each  of  the  target  groups,  to  promote  efficiency  of  public  expenditure  and  to \nenhance  professional  skills,  the  Royal  Government  will  align  the  existing  pension \nschemes under one management system. Furthermore, it will expand the coverage to \nall civil servants, including civil servants of executive, legislative and judicial branches \nand officials of other public institutions. \n \nC. Preparation of a system for voluntary exit for civil servants \nThe Royal Government will set up a system which allows civil servants to exit from \ntheir work. This will assist those who want to exit their civil servant status early and for \nvarious reasons, e.g. a long employment period, old age, family, health or a mismatch \nbetween  their  capacity  and  required  expertise.  The  exit  option  will  create  job \nopportunities for young people with an adequate profile. The voluntary exit system \nrequires careful consideration on the criteria, benefits or additional allowances to be \nprovided to individuals who wish exit early.  \n \nD. Implementation of a Pension Scheme for Workers and Employees  \nBesides the public pension scheme reform, the Royal Government is assessing \npossibilities for operating a pension scheme for workers and employees which are \nunder the provision of the Labor Law. The scheme should be integrated into the future \nsingle management system and should consistent with the public pension scheme. \nThe  Royal  Government  will  consult  employee  and  employer  representatives  on \ncontributions and benefits for the future scheme. \n \nE. Implementation of a Pension Scheme for Non-poor working in the Informal \nSector \nTo achieve the vision of providing social protection to all citizens when reaching \nold age, the Royal Government will assess possibilities of operating a pension scheme \nfor citizens working in the informal sector who neither poor nor vulnerable (e.g. market \nvendors). International experiences show that operating a pension scheme for this \ntarget group is very challenging due to difficulties in identifying eligible members and \ntargeting their unstable income (i.e. the unstable bases for contribution calculation).  \nThis pension scheme has to be  implemented step by step, starting with  the \nencouragement of voluntary participation and making it compulsory later, depending on \nkey preconditions such as income level of citizens, awareness of pension scheme \nbenefits,  professional  maturity,  capacity  to  manage  the  pension  scheme  and \n24 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \ntransparency of the operating institutions. Implementing a flat-rate contribution system \nis considered to be an option for this type of pension scheme.  \n \nF. Implementation of a Voluntary Pension Scheme \nTo provide alternatives for long-term savings for people with medium and high \nincome,  the  Royal  Government  will  develop  the  necessary  infrastructure  and legal \nframework for the operation of voluntary pension schemes by financial institutions. The \nvoluntary pension scheme is the third pillar of a general pension system developed by \nthe World Bank which has been globally implemented. The scheme complements the \ncompulsory pension schemes which are a mechanism for basic savings only.  \n \nG. Portability \n All pension schemes will ensure that the period of contribution is maintained and \nthat benefits are kept consistent when a member transfers from one targeted group to \nanother. An example would be the change from the pension scheme for civil servants \nto the one for workers and employees or vice versa.  \n3.1.3.2  Financial Framework \nDemographic changes and the trend of continuous salary increase for public \nofficials might lead to a sharp increase in state budget expenditure to support the public \npension scheme in the medium and long term. As a result, to ensure reasonable \nnational  budget  expenditure,  the  Royal  Government  will  reform  the  financing \nmechanism to support the public pension scheme from a public budget based Pay-As-\nYou-Go mechanism to a contribution based pension system. This system will require \npublic  officials  to  contribute  to  a  uniform  pension  fund.  However,  contribution \nrequirements into such a pension scheme and other national social security funds \nmust be developed in a way which does not affect the current salary of public officials. \nBefore collecting  contributions from public officials, the  Royal Government will \nconduct a comprehensive study to define technical aspects of the contributory pension \nsystem. This study will include the criteria for public officials, whether or not they will be \nrequired to pay contribution or if they are exempted based on their working seniority, \nretirement age or salary scales. The study will also review the retirement age which is a \nkey factor for the labor productivity and the financial sustainability of a pension system.  \nSub-decree no. 73, dated 29 April 2011, on Defining a Contribution Rate to Support \nthe NSSFC, only foresees a combined contribution rate for all national social security \nschemes  for  civil  servants,  pensions,  invalidity,  work  injury,  maternity,  death  and \n25 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nsurvivor\u2019s  benefits.  As  all  public  pension  schemes  will  be  integrated into  a  single \nscheme, the contribution rate of each scheme should be re-considered in order to \nmaintain a balance between civil servants\u2019 salaries and national budget expenditure \nand to ensure consistency among all target groups. Therefore, the Royal Government \nwill review the contribution rates as laid down in the sub-decree mentioned above.   \nExperiences from other countries show a tendency of changing from defined \nbenefit pension schemes (DB) to defined contribution pension schemes (DC) to avoid \nthe serious financial burden such schemes represent for many of these countries. \nDemographic changes are the main reason for this shift. Benefits guaranteed by the \npension scheme (DB type) bear a certain risk for financial stability of the pension fund \nand  ultimately  for  the  state  budget.  The  Royal  Government  will  conduct  a \ncomprehensive study on types of pension schemes most suitable for Cambodia. The \nresults of this study will be an important input for determining the type of an appropriate \npension scheme for Cambodia. \n3.1.3.3  Legal and Regulatory Framework \nTo ensure an effective, transparent and accountable governance and management \nstructure, the Royal Government will develop a legal framework for supervising the \nimplementation of all public pension schemes. The legal framework will be part of the \nLaw on the Social Protection System which is supposed to be adopted in the future. In \naddition, the Royal Government will establish a legal framework for the management \nand operation of voluntary pension schemes in a separate regulation from that law. \nThe  legal  frameworks  will  clearly  define  the  basic  principles  of  pension  fund \nmanagement which aim at (1) providing protection for pension scheme members and \n(2) promote good governance of pension schemes. The pension fund is a type of trust \nfund which cannot be used for any purposes other than to invest in ways that serve the \ninterests of its members. Based on this principle, the legal framework has to clearly \ndefine  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  actor,  including:  trustee,  investment \nmanager, account administrator and custodian bank. \n3.2  Health Insurance \n3.2.1  General Overview \nExisting mechanisms play very important role in contributing to the progress toward \nuniversal  health  coverage.  Currently,  Cambodia  has  three  types  of  health  insurance \nschemes operated to serve specific target groups. \n26 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n3.2.1.1  Health Insurance Scheme for Poor People and for Children \nAs of now, around two million poor Cambodians have been receiving financial risk \nprotection, through the HEF, when using healthcare services at public health facilities \n(health centers and referral hospitals) nationwide. This Fund pays the user fees for those \nhealthcare services on behalf of the poor people, including: out-patient services (including \nbirth delivery) and in-patient services (including surgeries). The HEF also covers the cost \nof referring the patients to the hospitals, food allowances, one caregiver in case the patient \nneeds to stay in the hospital and funeral allowance. The HEF is a massive \u201cfinancial risk \nconcentration\u201d mechanism which helps to ensure an effective investment of state budget \nin  promoting  health  of  the  poor,  reducing  out  of  pocket  expenditure  on  healthcare, \npreventing risks associated with healthcare expenses and preventing people from falling \ninto poverty because of health-related issues. Financial support for this fund comes from \nthe Royal Government and development partners. Based on the Health Financing Strategic \nPlan, the Royal Government will take over full financing responsibility for the Health Equity \nFund in the future. \nBesides the HEF, the Royal Government has been contributing to the Kantha Bopha \nHospital Fund on an annual basis to support the provision of free out-patient and in-patient \nservices to children nationwide. In 2015, the Royal Government increased its subsidy to the \nKantha Bopha Hospital Fund to roughly 10 million US-Dollars. \n3.2.1.2  Community Based Health Insurance Schemes  \nA  number  of  NGOs  operate  8  voluntary  community-based  health  insurance \nschemes in 7 provinces and in Phnom Penh for the citizens working in the informal \nsector. As of the end of 2015, 148,418 people joined these schemes. Their funding is \nbased on contribution of their members and subsidies from development partners. \nThe operation of the schemes could be a trend for the future development of social \nhealth  insurance  of  the  informal  sector.  Currently,  some  of  the  schemes  are \nconverted into micro insurance institutions.  \n3.2.1.3  Private Health Insurance  \nAlthough the private health insurance is still at development stage, it has the \npotential for rapid growth. Currently, the scope of private health insurance products is \nstill small. By the end of 2015, there were only 8 insurance companies which provided \nhealth insurance products. The premium collected was 9.2 million US-Dollars, an \nequivalent of 10.8% of the total insurance market.  \n27 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n3.2.2  Challenges \n3.2.2.1  Institutional Framework \n \nA.

The health insurance schemes for each target group  are \ngoverned  separately  by  different  regulations  and  procedures.  The  current  HEF  is \nunder the supervision of MoH, with support from different development partners and \nNGOs who act as operators. The Community-Based Health Insurance is under the \nmanagement  of  NGOs.  The  management  fragmentation  has  generated  high \noperational cost, inconsistencies in terms of allowances and benefits, different criteria \nand options for members as well as differences in terms of priorities. \n \nB. Primary Healthcare System and Quality of Health Services \nGeneral quality of public health services increased, thanks to improved quality \nstructures, higher capacities in diagnosing as well as the provision of healthcare \nservices based on standard  procedures and operational  guidelines. However, the \nquality, especially of in-patient treatment services, does not meet the expectations of \npatients and clients, yet. Therefore, further improvement is necessary in terms of \ncapacity building for clinical staff, strengthening of regulatory mechanisms, regular \nquality monitoring and evaluation, more effective staff deployment based on common \ntechnical  standards.  All  these  measures  will  create  favorable  conditions  for  the \nimplementation  and  expansion  of  the  coverage  of  the  social  health  insurance \nschemes  for  civil  servants,  workers  and  employees  and  citizens  working  in  the \ninformal sector. \n3.2.2.2  Financial Framework \n \nA. Equity in Healthcare Utilization \nThe HEF provides health protection to poor people accounting for approximately \nnearly  20%  of  the  total  population.  The  Kantha  Bopha  hospitals  provide  health \nservices to children and infants, only. Besides the people who benefit from HEF or the \ncommunity-based  health  insurance  schemes  and  children  who  have  access  to \nKantha  Bopha  hospitals,  most  citizens  do  not  received  financial  protection  for \nhealthcare costs.    \n \n \n28 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n \nB. Most Healthcare Expenditure Is Out-of-Pocket \nThe  rising  national  budget  expenditure  on  healthcare  and  the  increase  in \nfamilies\u2019 ability to pay for the services they receive indicate an increase in total health \nexpenditures,  including  private.  However,  out-of-pocket  expenses  by  families\u2019  on \nhealthcare services are still the main source of financing for the health system. In \n2015, the direct out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare was around 60% of the total \nexpenditure on healthcare due to the limited coverage of the social health insurance.  \nThe  scale  of  out-of-pocket  expenses  is  beyond  the  ability  to  pay  for  many \nfamilies, which in turn creates many additional problems such as delay or suspension \nof healthcare access and particularly negative impacts on economic performance and \npoverty reduction efforts. The presence of these problems indicates the lack of an \neffective healthcare financing mechanism. \n3.2.2.3  Legal Framework and Regulations \nSo far, there is only the Sub-Decree on the Setting up of the Health Insurance \nScheme for those who are under the provisions of the Labor Law. Based on this Sub-\nDecree the health insurance scheme for workers and employees was implemented. \nThe health insurance schemes for civil servants and other groups of citizens do not \nhave any clear legal and regulatory framework they can be based on. \n3.2.3  Future Strategy and Goals \nIn  accordance  with  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals, \nCambodia defines its vision to reach universal health coverage like other countries in \nthe world. The main aim of developing a universal healthcare system is to maintain \nsocial solidarity by providing every Cambodian citizen with affordable and high quality \nhealthcare. The Royal Government strictly abides by four principles for the policy \ndevelopment and the social healthcare system reform: (1) good governance, (2) \neffective spending, (3) accountability, (4) financial sustainability.  \n3.2.3.1  Institutional Framework \n \nA. Implementation  of  a  Health  Insurance  Scheme  for  Workers  and \nEmployees \nThe Royal Government has approved the implementation of a health insurance \nscheme  for  workers  and  employees  by  issuing  the  Sub-Decree  No.  01,  dated  6 \nJanuary  2016,  on  the  Establishment  of  a  Health  Insurance  Scheme  for  Persons \ndefined by the Provisions of the Labor Law, in addition to the existing Employment \n29 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nInjury Insurance scheme. The new scheme will provide workers and employees with \ngeneral healthcare including medical care and treatment, maternity benefits as well \nas daily allowances for the absence from work resulting from sickness.  \n \nB. Implementation of a Health Insurance Scheme for Public Officials  \nThe Royal Government will implement a health insurance scheme for public \nofficials to ensure consistency with the health insurance scheme for workers and \nemployees. Implementing this scheme requires sufficient preparation of all relevant \naspects such as the setting and collecting of contributions, service delivery, payment, \nmanagement and legal frameworks. The health insurance scheme must be operated \nthrough a \u201cSingle Payer\u201d mechanism to ensure effectiveness and equity to reduce \nadministrative  cost.  In  this  context,  the  NSSF,  which  is  a  professional  and \nexperienced organization, is a potential institution to govern and manage the health \ninsurance scheme for public officials by expanding its responsibilities and based on \ngradual capacity increase in handling the necessary tasks. \nThe scheme will cover public officials, retirees and veterans, as well as their \ndependents. The step-by-step expansion of the coverage for each target group will be \ndone  based  on  two  important  factors:  budget  availability  and  capacity  to  provide \nhealth services by the health facilities.  \n \nC. Enhancement of Healthcare Quality  \n The  Royal  Government  will  pay  more  attention  on  improving  the  quality  of \nhealthcare services, of both public and private health facilities to reach a comparable \nlevel with neighboring countries. To achieve this goal, the Royal Government will \nimplement an accreditation system as a mechanism to ensure quality of healthcare \nservices, both state and private. The improvement in healthcare quality is a key to \nbuild up public confidence in the healthcare system as a whole. These steps will \npromote  people\u2019s  willingness  to  participate  and  facilitate  the  implementation  of  a \nhealth insurance scheme for people working in the informal sector.  \n \nD. Raising Awareness on Healthcare and Protection \nThe operating agency in charge of governing and managing a social health \ninsurance scheme is obliged to organize dissemination events and trainings public on \nhealthcare  and  protection  for  the  general.  The  activities  should  complement  the \nvarious national programs of the MoH. \n \n30 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n \nE. Monitoring Healthcare Service Payments  \nTo  avoid  conflicts  of  interests  and  other  frauds  which  might  occur  between \noperators and health facilities, the Royal Government will assess possibly to set up an \nindependent  agency  to  monitor  and  verify  healthcare  service  claims  of  health \nfacilities. The agency should foster confidence and trust among the public through a \ntransparent and accountable governance and management of the healthcare funds. \n \nF. Exploring the Options for Reinsurance \nTo reduce the risks which can affect the stability and sustainability of the social \nhealthcare  fund,  the  Royal  Government  will  consider  options  of  ceding  risks \nassociated with social health insurance operations to private insurance institutions. \nThe Royal Government will cooperate with private insurance institutions to assess the \npossibly for running the according operations based on market principles. \n \nG. Managing the Health Equity Fund and Kantha Bopha Fund \nIn accordance with the Health Financing Strategy, the Royal Government shall \nfully fund the HEF in the future. Therefore, the Royal Government will assign the \nmanagement of the HEF with a single social security operator. Furthermore, the Royal \nGovernment will assess possibilities to gradually include other vulnerable groups such \nas people with disabilities, elderly and children under 5 into the scope of the HEF, \ndepending on the fiscal capacity. \nThe  Royal  Government  will  also  consider  the  possibility  of  taking  full \nresponsibility for the financing and management of the Kantha Bopha Fund at a \nsuitable time. At this moment, the management of the fund will also be assigned to a \nsingle operator. \n \nH. Increasing Participation of Private Health Facilities \nTo expand coverage and enhance the quality of health services and to provide \nconvenience in receiving healthcare services through the health insurance schemes, \nthe Royal Government will encourage more participation from private health facilities. \nThe Royal Government will set up a uniform benefit package, which is appropriate and \naffordable  for  the  private  health  facilities  and  increases  the  choice  for  people \nparticipating in the social health insurance scheme.  \n \nI. Implementation of a Health Insurance Scheme for Non-Poor working in the \nInformal Sector \n31 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nTo achieve universal health coverage, the Royal Government will assess possibilities \nto implement a social health insurance scheme for non-poor citizens working in the \ninformal sector. This scheme will be operated on a voluntary basis in the early phase \nwith the option of transforming it into a compulsory scheme in the next phase of the \nproject depending on the economic situation at this time.  \nFigure 14: Management Structure of the Healthcare System \n \n3.2.3.2  Financial Framework \n \nA. Principles of Financing to Support the Health Insurance Scheme \nThe Royal Government will remain fully responsible for paying contributions on \nbehalf of the poor and vulnerable citizens. Other non-poor groups, in both formal and \ninformal sector, are obliged to pay contributions based on their income. The Royal \nGovernment will continue financing, where necessary, the operation of state health \nfacilities,  using  public  budget,  while  promoting  the  autonomy,  effectiveness, \naccountability and financial sustainability of health facilities.  \n \nB. Setting Contribution Rates  \nSetting the contribution rates for all health insurance schemes requires careful \nactuarial analysis and public consultation in order to mobilize supports from all actors \n32 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n\u2013 government agencies, representatives of employers, representatives of employees \nand of the wider public.  \n \nC. Increasing Investments in Infrastructure and Human Resources \nThe demand for healthcare services will increase continuously when the Royal \nGovernment sets forth the social health insurance schemes for workers, employees \nand civil servants. Further increase when the scheme expands its coverage to the \ninformal sector in the future. To respond to the expected increasing demand, the \nRoyal Government will further enhance its investment in infrastructure and human \nresources  in  the  health  sector  given  that  the  necessary  budgetary  capacity  is \navailable. \n3.2.3.3  Legal and Regulatory Framework \nThe  development  of  a  social  health  insurance  system  requires  a  legal  and \nregulatory framework to manage the system and to establish operational standards, \nespecially  with  regard  to  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various  stakeholders, \nfinancial  management  procedures,  financial  resources,  contribution  rates,  benefit \npackages  and  customer  protection.  The  legal  framework  and  the  according \nimplementing mechanisms should take the aim of moving towards universal health \ncoverage into account and, thus, promote obligatory participation of non-poor people \nworking  in  the  informal  sector.  In  addition,  it  will  be  necessary  to  provide  for \nmechanisms to ensure a certain level of quality, to integrate social security operators, \nto specify the roles of different regulators to ensure the smooth and effective operation \nof the social health insurance system.  \nAt the same time, the organization and functioning of NSSF will be revised to \nallow the agency to take over the role as the single operator in terms of governing \nand  managing  the  health  insurance  schemes  for  potential  additional  members, \nkeeping in mind that the NSSF covers only schemes for workers and employees who \nare under the provision of the Labor Law, yet.  \n3.3  Employment Injury Scheme \n3.3.1  General Overview \nCurrently, only workers and employees under the provisions of the Labor Law \nare fully covered by the employment injury scheme. The scheme provides insurance \nto workers and employees suffering from work-related accidents and illness. As of the \n33 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nend of 2015, roughly 1.2 million workers have joined the Employment Injury scheme, \nin which employers fully pay the contribution to the NSSF at a rate of 0.8 per cent of \nthe  average  \u201csubject-to-contribution  wages\u201d  (ranging  from  200,000  to  1,000,000 \nRiels, approx. 49 to 246 US-Dollars) of the employees. Benefits that employees can \nexpect to receive from the NSSF include: transportation, health care until recovery, \ndaily allowance during the period of absence from work, allowance for permanent \nwork injuries (which can be received in full or partly for every 3 months until death, \nfor injuries reducing the capacity to work by more than 20%), rehabilitation services, \nfuneral  allowance  and  allowance  for  dependents  (dependent  spouse,  children, \nparents and old people). \nFor civil servants, the benefits of employment injury scheme are provided for \npermanent disabilities incurred during the performance of the duties. However, during \na hospital treatment, general payments are maintained. \n3.3.2  Challenges \n3.3.2.1  Employment Injury Scheme for Workers \nThree main challenges are identified in the framework of the employment injury \nscheme  for  workers  and  employees  under  the  provisions  of  the  Labor  Law:  (1) \nchildren cannot receive the benefits  from NSSF when their father or mother dies from \na  work-related  incident  if  their  parents  do  not  have  a  marriage  certificate,  (2) \ndependent children with disabilities can receive the allowances from the NSSF only up \nto the age of 21 years, leaving those older than 21 years and unable to finance their \nown life without income, (3) the benefit package that includes rehabilitation services \nfor workers and employees has to be more clearly determined and made ready for \nimplementation.  \n3.3.2.2  Employment Injury Scheme for Civil Servants \nCurrently,  civil  servants  receive  monthly  allowances,  when  they  suffer  from \nwork-related injuries or experience permanent disabilities. The medical treatment and \ncare are provided based on the policies of different ministries, which still lack clear \nprinciples and standards. The arrangements did not provide full protection for civil \nservants  when  they  face  health  issues,  suffer  from  work-related  injuries  and \npermanent occupational illness or disabilities resulting from work-related incidents. \n \n \n34 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n3.3.3  Future Strategies and Goals \n3.3.3.1  Employment Injury Scheme for Workers \nThe Royal Government will make necessary amendments on relevant legal and \npolicy provisions on the employment injury scheme for workers and employees under \nthe provisions of the Labor Law to allow dependent children to receive allowances \neven  if  their  parents  who  were  members  of  the  NSSF  did  not  have  a  marriage \ncertificate. The amendments will also seek to allow children with disabilities who \ncannot generate own income to receive allowances for their whole lifetime. At the \nsame time, the Royal Government will include the additional rehabilitation services \ninto the benefit packages for all NSSF members.  \n3.3.3.2  Employment Injury Scheme for Civil Servants \nIn the short run, the Royal Government will set clear standards to support civil \nservants who suffer from work-related injuries. In the long run, the Royal Government \nwill establish an employment injury scheme for civil servants so that they are entitled \nto  additional  allowances/  benefits.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  consistency  with  other \nemployment injury schemes, especially with regard to additional healthcare services \nfor chronic occupational disease and permanent disabilities which require long term \nand expensive treatment. At this stage, to ensure consistency between the health \ninsurance scheme and the employment injury scheme for civil servants, the NSSF, \nwhich is the specialized and experienced institution on this matter, will be in charge of \nmanaging the employment injury scheme for civil servants.  \n3.4  Unemployment \n3.4.1  General Overview \nUp to now, an unemployment insurance scheme does not exist in Cambodia, \nyet. Putting such a scheme into place requires careful consideration of the current \nsocio-economic context of the country and a proper time for implementation. The \nenvisaged scheme will apply to workers under the provisions of the Labor Law, only. \nThe Royal Government has already adopted the National Employment Policy 2015-\n2025.  The  policy  indicates  the  need  to  conduct  a  feasibility  study  on  the \nimplementation of such a scheme. The National Employment Policy also touches on \nthe issues of unemployment by seeking to provide decent employment opportunities, \nincreasing  labor  productivity,  developing  skills  and  human  resources,  as  well  as \n35 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nstrengthening labor market governance in response to a changing socio-economic \nenvironment. \n3.4.2  Challenges \nAlthough through the National Employment Policy already foreseen, the Royal \nGovernment  will  conduct  a  feasibility  study  on  the  implementation  of  an \nunemployment  insurance  scheme.  The  development  of  the  scheme  will  require \nconsiderable time and capacity to solve the identified problems and will depend on \nthe country\u2019s economic development. \nAn unemployment insurance scheme has never existed in Cambodia so far and \nmanaging the future scheme requires appropriate corresponding human resource \ncapacities and skills. To date, the Royal Government assesses how to build up the \nrequired capacities and skills for relevant technical officials.  \n3.4.3  Future Strategies and Goals \nThe unemployment insurance scheme plays a very important role in protecting \nworkers and employees from poverty in case they lose their jobs. It is of even greater \nimportance in events of economic crises and, thus, it is one of the main components \nfor  maintaining  economic  balance  and  social  stability.  Therefore,  the  Royal \nGovernment  will  conscientiously  assess  the  possibilities  for  implementing  such  a \nscheme given an on-going economic growth.  \nIn addition to a feasibility study, building capacity of officials who will be in \ncharge of the scheme is crucial. Based on the characteristics of the future scheme, \nthe  MoLVT  will  lead  its  implementation.  In  preparation  of  its  implementation  the \nMoLVT  will  be  in  charge  of  conducting  the  feasibility  study  and  establishing  the \nrelevant  legal  framework  in  consultation  with  other  stakeholders  from  public  and \nprivate sector as well as development partners. \n3.5  Disabilities \n3.5.1  General Overview \nAccording to the 2013 Census, Cambodia there are around 300,000 people with \ndisabilities, an equivalent of 2.06% of the total population, living in Cambodia. Primary \ncauses  for  disabilities  are  the  large  quantity  of  landmines  and  unexploded \nammunition  left  from  the  war.  The  Royal  Government  paid  high  attention  to  the \nclearance of landmines and unexploded ammunitions by setting up the Cambodian \n36 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nMine Action Center and cooperating with development partners to prevent people from \nsuffering from disabilities. \nPromoting and expanding the basic rights of people with disabilities is one of the \nsocial welfare priority goals of the Royal Government. In accordance with the Law on \nthe Promotion of the Rights of People with Disabilities, the Government set up the \nDisability Action Council (DAC) as national coordinating mechanism for consultation \non the issues impacting people with disabilities, setting up the national strategy on \npeople with disabilities and monitoring and evaluating the implementation of further \npolicies related to disability matters.  \nThe People with Disability Fund (PWDF), established in 2010, is responsible for \npromoting  the  welfare  of  disabled  people  through  labor  rehabilitation,  vocational \ntraining and employment services. About 28,000 people receive support from PWDF \nannually.  \nThe Royal Government adopted the National Disability Strategic Plan 2014-2018, \nas  a  medium  term  roadmap  to  identify  policies,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  key \nstakeholders promoting the welfare of people with disabilities. \n3.5.2  Challenges \n3.5.2.1  Identification of People with Disabilities \nMechanisms to identify people with disabilities are still inconsistent, preventing \nsome  people  from  benefiting  from  the  policies  of  the  Royal  Government  and  the \ninvolved development partners. \n3.5.2.2  Financial Constraints \nRehabilitation centers, which are under the supervision of PWDF, needed to quit \none after another after withdrawal of some development partners from the program. In \n2002, Cambodia had 16 of these centers, but currently their number has dropped to \nonly 11 due to financial constraints.  \n3.5.2.3  Quality of the Rehabilitation \nThe  quality  of  the  rehabilitation  centers  is  still  limited  and  requires  further \nstrengthening of the skills of the technical staff in providing treatments to people with \ndisabilities and of the technical equipment necessary to help disabled people in their \ndaily routines. \n \n \n37 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n3.5.3  Future Strategies and Goals \n3.5.3.1  Reform on Identification of People with Disabilities \n  To effectively identify people with disabilities, the Royal Government will revise \nnecessary  mechanisms  and  procedures  with  priority  on  poor  disabled  people, \nstrengthening organizational capacity and the capacity of technical staff, developing \nnecessary ICT systems and improving the database management.  \n3.5.3.2  Review Conditions for the Provisions of Protection and Support \nTo reduce the inequality between people with disabilities of different groups, the \nRoyal Government will review the eligibility conditions and mechanisms to ensure that \nbenefits are provided to people with disabilities in an equitable manner. \n3.5.3.3  Promote Contributions from Private Sector \nThe Royal Government will incentivize the private sector to contribute to the \nfunding of the People with Disability Fund through various measures such as tax \ndeductible expenses. \n3.5.3.4  Enhance Quality of Labor Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities \nThe Royal Government will improve the quality of labor rehabilitation for people \nwith disabilities through effective treatment, recovery acceleration for patients and \nmore effective enforcement of the Labor Law to ensure better workplace safety to help \nreduce disability  risks caused by  work accidents. This will not only increase the \neffectiveness of the government spending but it will also improve the welfare of people \nwith disabilities. \n3.5.3.5  Increase Vocational Training for People with Disabilities \nThe Royal Government will encourage all people with disabilities to participate in \nvocational trainings so that they can go back to work or start their own business. The \nRoyal Government will also establish employment services for disabled people who \ncompleted vocational trainings. \n3.5.3.6  Integrate the Management of the People with Disabilities Fund \nThe Royal Government will integrate the management of the PWDF and assign it \nto a single social security operator to improve the cost-effectiveness of spending and \nenable cross- subsidy from the surplus of other schemes to help promote the welfare \nof  people  with  disabilities.  Moreover,  assigning  the  management  of  Rehabilitation \nCenters to a single operator will allow for further expanding the service delivery to \n38 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nevery affected person including disabled civil servants, workers and employees who \nlose their physical capacity during their work and other disable people.   \n   \n39 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n4.1  General Overview \nCurrently, social protection policies have been set forth by many ministries and \ninstitutions  in  accordance  with  their  own  functions  and  duties.  MoSAVY  has  the \nmandate to set up policies related to both social  assistance program and social \nsecurity schemes, including those for civil servants, veterans and for people with \ndisabilities. MoLVT focuses on social security for workers and employees that are \nunder the provisions of the Labor Law. MoH is in charge of the HEF which provides \nhealth protection to poor and vulnerable people and promotes the health of mothers \nand children. MoEYS focuses on supporting school feeding programs and providing \nscholarships. MEF is in charge of the food security programs. CARD, in addition, acts \nas a coordinator for setting up social assistance policies.  \n4.2  Challenges \nThe  separate  processes  of  setting  up  social  protection  policies  in  various \nministries and institutions indicate the lack of a unified coordination mechanism. The \narrangement has led to inconsistencies, gaps and overlaps of each policy, which \nnegatively  impacts  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  the  use  of  resources,  both \nfinancial and human. \nIn addition, the mechanism to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the \nmanagement or operation of each program is not yet well defined, creating obstacles \nto  the  measurement  of  productivity  and  effectiveness  of  public  expenditure  and \ndifficulties in implementing other policies that might follow. \n4.3  Future Strategy and Goals \nIn  light  of  the  identified  challenges  and  shortcomings  of  the  governance \nstructure of the social protection system, the Royal Government aims to establish a \nconcentrated, integrated, consistent and effective organizational framework for the \nsocial protection system which covers the public and the private sector likewise. It will \nprovide  clear  definitions  of  roles  and  responsibilities  within  and  among  of  policy-\nmakers, regulators and operators. \n \n \n40 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n4.3.1  Policy-Maker \nTo develop the social protection system and to ensure better harmonization of \nthe  different  strategies,  policies  and  other  social  protection  activities,  the  Royal \nGovernment will establish the \u201cNational Social Protection Council\u201d (NSPC). The NSPC \nwill be the key actor responsible for the overall coordination and steering on the \ndevelopment of various social protection strategies and policies. \n4.3.1.1  Composition of the NSPC \nTo  ensure  effective  coordination  of  multi-sectoral  issues,  the  NSPC  will  be \nestablished by and composed of high-ranking representatives from relevant ministries \nand  institutions.  Amongst  others,  it  will  comprise  representatives  of  the  MEF, \nMoSAVY, MoLVT, CARD, MoI, MoH, MoP, MoJ and MoCS. \n4.3.1.2  Responsibilities of NSPC \nThe  NSPC  will  have  the  following  responsibilities:  (1)  coordinate  the  policy \ndrafting on the social protection system among relevant ministries and institutions to \nsubmit a common policy proposal to the Royal Government for approval, (2) monitor \nand  evaluate  the  progress  and  effectiveness  of  the  social  protection  policy \nimplementation to ensure a smooth, consistent, efficient and effective process, (3) \nconnect and harmonize the social assistance system with the social security system, \nin order to ensure their consistency and to align positions on the social protection \nsystem for additional actions as well as to allow the possible transfers of members \nfrom one system to another, if necessary. The NSPC should have a Secretariat to \ncover its daily operations. The Secretariat will be established within a ministry or \ninstitution,  based  on  the  principles  of  effectiveness,  managerial  efficiency  and \ninstitutional coordination. \n4.3.2  Regulator \nUnlike the Social Assistance system and activities which are financed by the \nstate budget, the success of the Social Security System depends on the trust of the \nparticipants who contribute to it. Therefore, it requires a proper monitoring mechanism \nto ensure that the benefits of the participants are safeguarded. The implementation of \nthe social security schemes is complicated and associated with high risks, which \nmight affect the stability of the financial sector, the national budget and the country\u2019s \neconomy as a whole. Therefore, the Royal Government will establish a social security \nregulator to manage and coordinate the operation and management of the various \n41 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nschemes.  This  regulatory  body\u2019s  main  role  is  to  monitor  the  financial  situation, \ndetermine prudential regulation, standards of operation, additional measures and to \ncontrol the schemes\u2019 compliance. It will ensure that the social security schemes are \noperated  in  a  transparent,  accountable  and  with  financially  sustainable  manner. \nFurthermore, the regulator will develop mechanisms to protect customers and to \narbitrate conflicts.  \nTo  enhance  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  system  and  to  avoid \nestablishing  additional  institutions  opposing  the  principal  of  efficient  budgetary \nspending, the Secretariat of the NSPC will function as the regulator.   \n4.3.3  Operator \nOne  of  the  main  goals  of  the  social  protection  reform  is  to  re-organize  the \nmanagement  structure  of  the  operators  to  promote  management  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of budget spending. To this point, the Royal Government will introduce a \nset of reforms. \n4.3.3.1  Social Assistance Operator \nThe Royal Government will assess possibilities to create a social assistance fund \nto  manage  and  launch  the  national  Social  Assistance  Program,  specifically  with \nregard to cash transfers. The aim of the fund is to provide a mechanism to integrate \nall cash transfer programs in one single hub in the future. \nThe social assistance fund also plays a significant role in organizing the work at \nsub-national  level  to  promote  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  social  assistance \nservices provision and to coordinate the management of member registration systems \nto ensure comprehensiveness and concentration.   \n4.3.3.2  Social Security Operator \nThe  Royal  Government  will  integrate  the  existing  social  security  operators \nNSSFC, NFV, NSSF and PWDF into one single institution.

The securities market started its operation in \n2011,  but  up  to  now  there  are  only  4  companies  (of  which  2  are  state-owned \nenterprises)  registered  to  trade  their  shares.  With  the  aim  of  promoting  the \ndevelopment  of  the  securities  market  in  Cambodia,  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission of Cambodia (SECC) amended the Prakas on Initial Public Offerings to \nease the requirements for listed companies by separating the market into two: (1) a \nmarket  for  big  enterprises  and  (2)  a  market  for  small  and  medium  enterprises \n(SMEs).     \nFurthermore,  the  real  estate  sector  expanded  substantially  after  the  global \nfinancial crisis.  \n5.1.2  Challenges \nFinancial instruments available for the fund to invest in are not diversified. The \nabsence  of  government  bonds  and  the  small  number  of  listed  companies  in \nCambodia\u2019s  security  market  are  the  main  obstacles  to  setting  up  an  investment \npolicy. For instance, NSSF as social security operator using its fund surplus to invest, \nis fully depending on bank deposits. Moreover, the necessary professional skills and \nregulatory framework for this sector are still lacking.  \n5.1.3  Future Strategies and Goals \n5.1.3.1  Continue to Encourage the Listing of Companies \nThe Royal Government continues to encourage private companies and public \nenterprises to issue shares to the public by revising the sub-decree on tax incentives \nin the securities sector. The SECC revised the requirements for listing companies to \n45 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nenable SMEs to generate funds from the securities market. The Royal Government \nhopes the number of companies listed will increase steadily. \n5.1.3.2  Boost the Development of Securities Market \nThe  Royal  Government  established  regulatory  and  technical  framework  to \nprepare for issuing government bonds, in accordance with the Strategy for Public \nDebt Management. The government bond market does not only promote investments \nof the social security fund but also serves as a necessary catalyst for boosting the \ndevelopment of capital markets and money markets. Moreover, government bonds \nwill be a proper mechanism for generating sustainable financial resources for the \nRoyal  Government,  especially  when  official  development  assistances  continue  to \ndecrease.  In  addition,  the  Royal  Government  established  the  necessary  legal \nframework to allow private companies to issue corporate bonds. \n5.1.3.3  Set Guidelines on Investment \nThe social security regulator is responsible for developing guidelines on fund \ninvestments of operators. The guidelines focus on investment diversification, types of \nportfolios and risk appetite for the purpose of maintaining stability and sustainability of \nthe funds managed.   \n5.1.3.4  Set up Regulations Related to Fund Investment \nThe Royal Government, through SECC, will set up regulations related to the \nsupervision  and  issuance  of  licenses  for  collective  investment  scheme  (CIS)  to \noperate in Cambodia. At the same time, the process on establishing a Trust Law will \nalso be pursued to provide a regulatory framework to protect all investment activities \nin due time.    \n5.2  Tax Policy \n5.2.1  General Overview \nA comprehensive consideration of tax policies related to the operation of the \nsocial protection system is an important factor contributing to the development of the \nsystem  and  promoting  citizens\u2019  participation.  The operation  of  the  social  security \nscheme, which is a contributory scheme, should be reflected in the tax policies, \nespecially with regard to: (1) contributions, (2) profits from the fund investment, (3) \npayment of benefits. \n46 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nAccording to the content of the circular 002, dated 20 January 2015 by MEF on \nthe Tax on Salary (and fringe benefits), benefits that workers and employees receive \nfrom the social security schemes shall not be included in the salary tax calculation, \nnor are they the subject to the tax on additional benefits. The tax treatment of social \nsecurity benefits received by other groups of citizens is not clearly defined, yet. \n5.2.2 Challenges \n  Tax policies related to the operation of social protection systems have not been \nclearly defined, while the respective systems are still implemented. Clear definitions of \nthe relevant tax regimes can facilitate the development of social protection systems, \nby encouraging contributions to the social security schemes and donations to support \nthe (non-contributory) social assistance programs.   \n5.2.3 Future Strategies and Goals \n5.2.3.1  A Tax Regime on the Contributions to the Social Security Schemes \nContributions made to the social security schemes for civil servants and the one \nfor workers and employees should be excluded from the calculation of the salary tax. \nThe  MEF  will  set  up  the  necessary  legal  framework  to  define  the  respective  tax \ncalculations.  \n5.2.3.2  A Tax Regime on the Return from the Investment Funds \nGenerally, the profit generated from investment funds shall be subject to the \nrelevant tax regime. However, to offer additional benefits to pensioners, the Royal \nGovernment  will  assess  possibilities  to  provide  tax  incentives  on  these \noperations/benefits, in particular. \n5.2.3.3  A Tax Regime on Benefits of the Social Security Schemes \nThat  allowances  and  benefits  received  from  a  social  security  scheme  are \nexempted from any tax is yet to be defined. The Royal Government will establish the \nnecessary legal framework to fill this gap. \n5.2.3.4  A Tax Regime for Donations/Voluntary Contributions to the Social \nAssistance Fund \nThe  Royal  Government  will  assess  possibilities  to  provide  tax  incentives  on \ndonations/voluntary contributions to the various social assistance funds. Distracting \nthe donations/voluntary contributions made by enterprises or institutions from their \ntaxable income is a priority for further analyses. \n \n47 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \n5.3  Registration System \n5.3.1 General Overview \nThe registration system of citizens who receive benefits from social assistance \nprograms  and  social  security  schemes  is  organized  separately.  It  is  set  up  in \naccordance  with  the  tasks  and  duties  of  the  concerned  agencies  which  are \nresponsible for the different programs and schemes.   \nThe MoP is the institution in charge of establishing and updating the ID Poor \nCard system to identify eligible people to receive benefits from the social assistance \nprograms.  NSSFC,  NFV,  NSSF  and  PWDF  each  run  separate  systems  for  the \nmanagement and registration of their members. The identification and civil registration \nof the general population, however, is under the mandate of the MoI. \n5.3.2 Challenges \nImplementing  the  different  registration  systems  can  lead  to  duplications  of \ncitizen\u2019s identification, resulting in one citizen having more than one \u2018identity\u2019. This \nundermines the accuracy of the population database and in turn creates targeting \nproblems for the social protection policy and other development policies. The repetitive \nwork of the different agencies results in an inefficient use of resources. Moreover, \nrunning multi-registration and identification systems is costly in itself.  \n5.3.3  Future Strategies and Goals \nThe Royal Government seeks to reform the identification management system \nby  using  biometric  information  to  prevent  overlapping  entries.  Through  this  new \nsystem, a citizen is registered only once. \nThe Royal Government will link the new identification system with other systems \nsuch as the equity card management system of the MoP or the registration systems \nof  social  security  operators  to  enhance  effectiveness  in  data  management,  data \nsharing among authorized institutions, cost minimization and avoidance of duplication \nof work.  \n5.4  Education \n5.4.1 General Overview \nThe  understanding  of  Cambodian  citizens  related  to  social  protection  is  still \nlimited. As a matter of fact, a large number of citizens used to get benefits from such \n48 \n   ", "Unofficial Translation \nsystem already, especially through the various social assistance programs that the \nRoyal Government implemented in the past. \nPeople\u2019s understanding about social security is even more limited. Cambodian \npeople have heard about the pension for civil servants. However, not many people \nexpect that those working in the private sector will also receive pension. \nUnderstanding of this particular  system has been much improved  in recent \nyears through the presence of NSSFC, NFV, NSSF and PWDF. The institutions have \nbeen actively involved in promoting public awareness through their regular work and \nvarious information dissemination activities.  \n5.4.2 Challenges \nThe currently low level of development of the social protection system is the \nmain  reason  why  the  public  has  so  little  understanding  of  it.  The  information \ndissemination related to this system has also been limited. \nSocial  protection  has  not  been  a  topic  widely  shared  in  the  regular  school \ncurriculum of the MoEYS. \n5.4.3 Future Strategies and Goals \nTo  promote  knowledge  and  awareness  for  the  social  protection  system  in \nCambodia, the Royal Government will take two approaches: (1) direct education, (2) \nindirect education. \n5.4.3.1  Promote Direct Education  \nThis  approach  seeks  to  promote  knowledge  through  direct  education  and \ninformation  dissemination  on  the  policy  or  specific  social  protection  programs. \nRegulators  and  operators  should  cooperate  and  set  up  programs  to  widely \ndisseminate information to the public to facilitate better understanding of basic rights \non receiving benefits from the social protection system and the own obligations to \nparticipate in it. \n5.4.3.2  Promote Indirect Education  \nThe Royal Government will explore possibilities to include basic financial literacy \ninto  school  curricula  of  different  grades  in  order  to  gradually  mainstream  the \nunderstanding of personal financial management of Cambodian children. \nThe  aim  is  not  only  to  promote  the  public\u2019s  basic  understanding  on  social \nprotection but also on the financial system as a whole.
