The National Housing Bank (NHB), India\u2019s government-owned mortgage refinancing \ninstitution, and the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India\u2019s leading housing \nfinance  institution  with  majority  private  sector  ownership,  have  applied  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to further develop India\u2019s mortgage \nmarket. Both want to explore sponsorship, jointly with ADB, for the establishment of a new entity \nthat will provide credit enhancement and an issuance/trading window for residential mortgage-\nbacked securities (RMBS) as an effective source of refinancing for home mortgage lenders in \nIndia. The Government of Switzerland has agreed to fund $250,000 of the cost of the TA.1 Since \nthe TA was not included in India\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP), separate concept \nclearance has been obtained.2 \n \n2.  Several missions were fielded in 2003 and 2004 to reach agreement on the scope of the \nTA  with  the  counterparties,  and  concurrence  was  obtained  between  all  three  parties  with \nrespect to all aspects of the TA, including the TA framework (Appendix 1). Consistent with the \nAgreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, the Government of India (Government) \nwill be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed TA to NHB and HDFC. In \naddition, the Government will be asked to confirm that Section 3.01 (b), and the assurances \nrelating  to  the  extension  of  privileges,  immunities  and  exemptions  of  ADB  consultants  in \nparagraphs 7 through 9 of the Schedule to the Technical Assistance Framework Agreement, \ndated 10 July, 1996, between the Government and ADB apply to any ADB consultants under \nthe  TA  (Extended  No-objection).  No  activities  under  the  TA  will  commence  and  no  TA \nconsultant will be contractually engaged by ADB unless and until the Government Extended No-\nobjection has been obtained. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Indian Housing Market Challenges. India faces a considerable challenge to provide \nadequate housing for its increasing urban population. While the housing mortgage market in \nIndia has grown rapidly in the past few years\u2014driven by an expanding economy, increasing \nconsumer  wealth,  stable  property  values,  and  falling  interest  rates\u2014the  penetration  of \nmortgages relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is still low in India (at about 2% of GDP) \ncompared to other countries in similar stages of economic development or other countries within \nthe Asian region (e.g., Indonesia is at 8% and Thailand at 13%, while the more developed \nTaipei,China is at 25% of GDP). The reason is an underdeveloped housing finance market. \nLenders remain vulnerable to significant credit, liquidity, and interest rate risks. As a result, \nhousing finance is relatively expensive and often rationed. The importance of developing robust \nsystems of housing finance is paramount for emerging economy governments that struggle to \ncope with population growth, rapid urbanization, and rising expectations from a growing middle \nclass. \n \n4.  India\u2019s mortgage market has historically been dominated by housing finance companies \n(HFCs). Recently, commercial banks have entered the market. HFCs are more competitive in \nterms of origination and reaching underserved segments, but face higher costs and tighter \nliquidity constraints compared to the commercial banks that have better access to funding but \ntend to focus on larger loan sizes. The question is whether the availability of an assured \nmatching funding source\u2014e.g., by way of securitization\u2014would encourage the entry of new \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 December 2004. \n2  Concept clearance was obtained in February 2005. \n ", "2     \nHFCs that would expand the availability as well as demand for housing finance for low- and \nmiddle-income families. \n \n5.  In many, more developed, economies, the capital markets provide an attractive and \nlarge  source  of  long-term  funding  for  housing  finance.  The  development  of  securitization \ntechnology especially (see Appendix 2 for a description of securitization in general) has enabled \nbanks  to  take  advantage  of  various  financing  benefits,  as  securitization  (i)  provides  for \nregulatory capital relief for the securitized assets that can be used to make new loans; (ii) lowers \nthe bank\u2019s overall interest expense as the issued (secured) securities obtain higher ratings than \nthe general (unsecured) corporate debt of the originators, further enabling the bank to make \nnew investments and loans; and (iii) improves the bank\u2019s performance metrics, making it more \nattractive to both domestic and foreign investors, which in turn gives the bank better access to \ncapital and lowers its financing cost. \n \n6.  The issuance of RMBS3 has provided the primary home mortgage lenders in more \ndeveloped  economies  with  consistent  availability  of  funds  in  varying  economic  conditions. \nRMBS allow lenders to better manage their long-term funding needs and associated interest \nrate risks. In addition, mortgage securities are pursued to develop and diversify fixed-income \nmarkets as a supplement to government bonds for institutional investors. In the United States \n(US), over 60% of all mortgages get securitized. \n \n7.  In India, the secondary market for mortgages is in its infancy. The Indian mortgage \nmarket is characterized by bilateral customized transactions, with a limited investor base, mainly \nbecause of the prevailing regulatory conditions (Appendix 2 outlines some of the regulatory \nhurdles that are constraining the growth of a robust RMBS market). However, even with the \nmuch needed regulatory improvements4 in place, it is likely that RMBS issues will require \nexternal credit enhancement to be attractive alternatives to government securities for long-term \ninstitutional investors (such as pension funds, which are generally risk averse). This is due to \nthe fact that, while the securitization market (on the surface) has grown rapidly since a pilot \nissue by NHB in 2000\u2014three pools worth Rs14.1 billion (approx. $320 million) were securitized \nin 2002\u20132003 and 11 pools worth Rs23.4 billion (approximately $530 million) in 2003\u20132004, and \ngrowth  of  RMBS  issuance  is  expected  at  more  than  50%  per  year  until  20065\u2014it  is \nacknowledged that neither the pilot securitization by NHB nor the recent issues by other market \nparticipants would meet the \u201ctrue sale\u201d6 test under the Basel II norms, and therefore would not \nqualify for off-balance sheet treatment for capital adequacy purposes, as originators retain the \njunior tranches. Without true sale, assets are not bankruptcy remote, so the ratings are capped \nat the level of the originator. Only with external credit enhancement can the ratings pierce the \noriginator\u2019s rating ceiling and attract long-term institutional investors. \n \n8.  Currently,  India  does  not  have  such  an  external  credit  enhancement  agency  or \nsecondary mortgage securitization institution (e.g. similar to Fannie Mae in the US) that would \nsupport the issuance of RMBS and a secondary trading market to provide investors with viable \n                                                 \n3  Broadly defined to include mortgage-backed bonds issued by specialist agencies. \n4  The Government fielded a working group on securitization in 2000, the recommendations of which are still awaiting \nfull implementation. Government support for implementation will be a key issue to assess under the TA. \n5  Estimate by CRISIL Ltd., the main rating agency for securitization in India. \n6  The assets that are being securitized have to be transferred from the originator to the issuing special-purpose \nvehicle in a manner that is opposable against the originator and any creditors of the originator in case of its \nbankruptcy, to ensure that its assets do not fall into the bankruptcy estate of the originator or are subject to any \napplicable moratorium provisions\u2014\u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d In other words, investors buy the credit risk of the \nsecuritized (transferred) asset pool and not the general corporate risk of the originator. \n ", "      3\nexit options. Therefore, NHB, HDFC, and ADB are discussing a possible cooperation to launch \nsuch  an  initiative  through  equity  participation,  subject  to  confirmation  of  a  viable  business \nmodel. Citibank and State Bank of India7 have also expressed interest in joining as equity \npartners in this initiative. \n \n9.  Link to ADB Strategy. The development of urban infrastructure has been identified as a \nkey component for social development, human poverty reduction, and environmental protection \nin India\u2019s CSP.8 Private sector development is identified as a strategic focus area to achieve \nsome  of  the  CSP  objectives,  including  financial  sector  interventions  to  improve  financial \nintermediation  and  resource  mobilization,  policy  reforms  to  remove  impediments  to  private \ninvestment, and public-private partnerships and investment in projects that facilitate private \ninvestment.  \n \n10.  In 2000, ADB funded TA9 to develop the Indian long-term debt market. Many of the \nrecommendations under this TA (3473-IND) related to the infrastructure for trading in debt \ninstruments.10  This  is  no  longer  a  constraint,  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  the  government \nsecurities market is robust with active trading. The lack of depth in the corporate bond market \nbecause of the narrow investor base was also noted, and partly ascribed to the public sector \nownership of banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. The ownership is not, however, \ncurrently  considered  to  be  as  big  a  problem  as  are  the  investment  guidelines  for  the \ninsurance/pension funds (known as provident funds).11 Availability of RMBS, of credit quality \nclose to that of government securities, would make a strong argument for the provident funds to \ndiversify their holdings, with investment parameters driven more by credit quality rather than the \npublic-sector status of the issuer. The study carried out under the TA also identified institutional \nsupport to provide a window for secondary market trading as an important factor to develop the \ncorporate bond market.  \n \n11.  Under Part D of ADB's Housing Finance Project II (HFP II),12 a study (PPTA 3288) was \nenvisaged  on  expanding  the  capital  market  for  housing  finance.  This  was  subsequently \ndropped, as provision of market-based housing financing was not considered viable to address \nthe housing requirements for the poorest section of society.13 Instead, a small-scale TA was \nproposed to strengthen NHB\u2019s capacity in the area of asset liability management and mortgage \nsecuritization. Under this TA (3732), NHB staff underwent training in securitization by Fannie \nMae. The current study will build on the knowledge gained by NHB, as its representatives would \nbe part of the steering committee for this study. The policy reform area under HFP II also \nincluded analyzing the findings and lessons learned from the first pilot securitization by NHB.14 \n \n                                                 \n7  The largest commercial bank in India.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to develop a mechanism for issuance of \u201ctrue sale\u201d RMBS in \nIndia  for  providing  matched  funding  to  both  bank  and  nonbank  institutions  to  ensure \nsustainability of important delivery channels, including those that specialize in low-value, high-\nvolume  lending  segments,  through  setting  up  of  a  credit  enhancement  agency/secondary \nmortgage institution (Agency), similar to Fannie Mae in the US, which could undertake one or \nseveral  of  the  following  roles  (depending  on  the  outcome  of  this  study):  (i)  mortgage \nsecuritization, (ii) RMBS credit enhancement, and (iii) RMBS trading or market-making. The \noutput will consist of: a feasibility study, a comprehensive business plan, an implementation \nplan, and an investor prospectus. The feasibility study and business plan will be used by NHB, \nHDFC and ADB to gauge the potential for jointly establishing the Agency. Appendix 1 outlines \nthe framework for the TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The key activities of the TA are: (i) assessment of the Indian RMBS market\u2019s potential \nand its legal and regulatory situation; recommending identified policy changes; and estimating \nthe financial risk/return for potential investors in the Agency; (ii) formulation of a comprehensive \nbusiness plan for the Agency including a proposal for optimal shareholder- and organizational \nstructures; (iii) formulation of a time-bound action plan for the creation of the Agency; and (iv) \npreparation of an investor prospectus and a list of potential investors. \n \n14.  The review of the current RMBS market, associated regulations and policies, institutional \nframework and the identification of the gaps vis-\u00e0-vis the needs of issuers and investors will be \nbased on industry reports/publications available publicly or with ADB, NHB, and HDFC, and \ninterviews with key industry participants, and relate to the securitization experience in developed \neconomies and elsewhere in Asia. A stakeholder conference will be organized after completion \nof the preliminary report to enable the formulation of a consensus-based implementation plan. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $320,000 (detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3), to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Switzerland up to \n$250,000, and administered by ADB. The grant is expected to cover the full foreign exchange \ncomponent of $125,000 and $125,000 of the local currency cost. It will cover, on a lump-sum \nbasis, the consultants\u2019 fees and out-of-pocket expenses including their cost for coordinating the \nstakeholder workshop. Counterpart cost sharing of $70,000 equivalent will provide for office \naccommodation and transport, travel cost and remuneration for counterpart staff, and other \nexpenses. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  An international consulting firm will be recruited using biodata technical proposals under \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method under an output-based contract, in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory for the \nengagement of domestic consultants, to carry out the study during a period of 5 months (outline \nterms of reference are in Appendix 4). TA completion is expected by November 2005, with \n ", "      5\ndelivery of the preliminary study before, and the final report after, the stakeholder workshop, \nplanned  for  August  2005.  Dissemination  will  be  among  the  stakeholders  and  to  selected \nprospective investors. The TA will be executed by ADB in coordination with NHB and HDFC. A \nsteering  committee  comprising  representatives  from  each  institution  will  review  monthly \nprogress. The Government of India will be represented by NHB as the government-owned \nagency principally responsible for providing full support to HFCs and formulating schemes for \nmobilizing resources for housing. NHB is under the administrative control of the Reserve Bank \nof India, and its participation will facilitate standardizing lending criteria and loan documentation, \nas it is today the only secondary mortgage finance institution in India. \n \nIV.

Description of Securitization \n \n1.  In  its  simplest  form,  securitization  is  a  process  whereby  the  revenue  stream  on  a \nsegregated pool of receivables or other income producing (mostly financial) assets owned by an \noriginal  lender  or  commercial  enterprise  (originator)  is  repackaged  into  tradable  securities \nissued to investors. The receivables are sold by the originator to a specially incorporated, off-\nbalance sheet company or trust, known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). In return, the SPV \nwill generally pay a purchase amount equal to the (par or net present) value of the receivables \nand  with  limited  recourse  or  no-recourse  against  the  originator  for  nonperformance  of  the \nunderlying debtors.  \n \n2.  The  SPV  will  be  structured  to  control  its  income  and  expenses  so  that  it  will  be \n\u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d The SPV will fund the purchase of the receivables through the issue of \ndebt securities to investors, which will be secured on the receivables by virtue of a security \ninterest granted to a security trustee acting for the investors and other creditors. \n \n3.  The  originator  (or  an  associated  company)  may  continue  to  act  as  the  servicer  in \ncollecting and administering the receivables as an agent of the SPV, who in turn will apply the \nincome from the receivables to make payment of principal and interest under the debt securities \nas well as transaction expenses. A standby servicer may also be arranged in case the originator \nfails to perform its servicing obligations. Funds received by the SPV in excess of those required \nto pay investors are generally channeled back to the originator. \n \n4.  Various forms of credit and liquidity enhancement will be used and structured into the \ntransaction cash flow to ensure that payments on the debt securities issued to the investors are \nmade in full and on a timely basis. Consequently, the recourse of the investors is usually limited \nto (i) the receivables, (ii) the transaction cash flow, and (iii) the credit enhancement incorporated \nin the securitization structure. \n \n5.  A high credit rating (usually higher than that of the originator) on the debt securities and \ntherefore cheaper funding can be obtained by reason of the quality of the receivables, the \nisolation of the receivables from the other risks of the originator\u2019s business (by arranging a \u201ctrue\u201d \nsale  of  the  receivables  from  the  originator  to  the  SPV)  and  the  arrangements  for  credit \nenhancement and liquidity support. \n \nB.   Regulatory Constraints in India\u2019s Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Market \n \n6.  Listed  below  are  certain  key  regulatory  constraints  in  the  Indian  RMBS  market  as \nidentified by the Private Sector Operations Department:  \n \n(i)  Restrictions on RMBS as an eligible investment by provident funds, insurance \ncompanies\u2014in the same category as government securities; \n(ii)  The  securities  (or  the  pass-through/pay-through  certificates)  issued  by  SPVs \nwould  need  to  be  notified  as  securities  under  the  Securities  and  Contract \nRegulation  Act  to  allow  for  trading  under  the  debt  segment  of  the  stock \nexchange; \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n(iii)  Lack of liquidity support for secondary market trading of RMBS given that these \ndo  not  have  the  status  of  \u201creserve\u201d  securities  that  encourages  trading  by \ncommercial banks; \n(iv)  Lack of clarity as to whether the SPV that holds the securitized assets can be \ncreated under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and \nEnforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002\u2014which will give the SPV \nthe benefit of a speedy foreclosure process; \n(v)  Lack of clarity on guidelines as well accounting policies for treatment of the \nsubordinate tranche/over collateralization retained on originators balance sheet \n(both with respect to taxation and capital adequacy requirements); and \n(vi)  Unresolved tax issues: \n(a)  The originator should be allowed to issue tax related certificates to the \nborrowers under section 88 and 24(b) even after sale/securitization of the \nmortgages so that benefits of Section 88 and Section 24(b) of the Income \nTax (IT) Act continue to be available to the borrowers; \n(b)  The benefits of Section 36(1)(viii) under the IT Act should include the \nincome arising out of securitized loans for the lenders, as the source of \nsuch income is the housing; and \n(c)  SPVs should not be taxed, as all revenues flow through to the different \nclasses of instruments. \n \n ", "    Appendix 3     9 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n       \nA.
