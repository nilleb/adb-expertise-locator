INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is systematically \nmanaging its development assistance, as required for better development results under the \nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, to which Lao PDR is a signatory. To promote wider buy-\nin to the aid reform process, the Government and 24 development partners, including the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), signed in November 2006 a joint statement the Vientiane Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness. The Vientiane Declaration effectively customizes the Paris Declaration for \nLao PDR\u2019s country-specific circumstances, considering Government ownership of development \npolicies  and  strengthened  leadership  in  coordinating  aid.  Further,  it  is  (i)  ensuring  that \ndevelopment partner strategies and policies are aligned with those of the Government within the \nframework of the Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 (NSEDP6); (ii) \nencouraging adoption of common development partner arrangements, simplified procedures, \nincreased authority of local development partner offices, and cooperation in preparing core \neconomic and analytical sector reviews; and (iii) fostering the use of sector-wide and program-\nbased approaches. To help strengthen capacities to improve aid effectiveness and provide \nparallel  cofinancing  for  selected  activities  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP) and Luxembourg\u2019s ongoing project of Enriching the Roundtable Process for Increased \nAid Effectiveness and Development Results, the Government requested capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) from ADB. Working together with the Government, the TA Fact-\nFinding Mission, carried out intermittently between December 2007 and July 2008, ascertained \nthe  context,  scope,  project  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  and  financing \narrangements,  and  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Government  is  implementing  its  5-year  NSEDP6  which  the  National  Assembly \napproved  in  October  2006.  NSEDP6  targets  7.5%\u20138.0%  annual  average  gross  domestic \nproduct growth; creating 652,000 additional jobs; reducing the number of poor households to \n15%; and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which form an integral part of \nNSEDP6. Progress so far in achieving the MDGs is mixed.2 Lao PDR is likely to achieve the \nMDG of halving the incidence of poverty by 2015, but progress in other areas is more spotty. \nFor human development, progress is satisfactory in primary education, but less so in primary \nhealth, control of communicable diseases, access to water and sanitation, and gender equality. \nLarge  segments  of  the  population  remain  without  access  to  basic  infrastructure,  and \ngreenhouse gases per capita continue to rise. The NSEDP6 now guides official development \nassistance (ODA) to the country. ODA constitutes a significant portion of the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment spending. Public investment accounted for 49% of total public expenditures in \nfiscal year 2007, of which 42% was financed by ODA. Through the roundtable process, external \naid has been aligned with the MDG-based NSEDP6 and development priorities while capacity \ndevelopment has been undertaken for ODA management. It is recognized that the Government \nwill need further support to achieve all MDGs. \n \n3.  NSEDP6\u2019s implementation will continue to rely heavily on ODA. The high levels of \ndevelopment  partner  activity  are  dispersed  across  many  sector  and  thematic  areas,  thus \nrequiring significant levels of support from existing aid management and development partner \ncoordination mechanisms. A high degree of aid dependence has also made it difficult to build \nsustainable domestic programs and to meet the recurrent outlays required to keep pace with \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 October 2007. \n2  ADB. 2007. 2007 Development Effectiveness Review. Manila. \n ", "2   \nrapid growth in public facilities and services. Consequently, there is considerable potential for \ngreater synergy and better use of aid resources. At the sectoral level, coordination between the \nGovernment and development partners occurs primarily through the eight sector working groups \n(SWGs). These groups have developed at varying rates. The groups are forums to discuss and \nbuild consensus about development priorities identified in the NSEDP6 while improving sectoral \naid coordination and effectiveness as set out in the Vientiane Declaration country action plan \n(CAP).  The  CAP  seeks  to  further  strengthen  government  leadership  in  formulating  and \nimplementing key plans, programs, and capacity development frameworks. It also promotes \naligning development partners\u2019 efforts with government plans and systems. The Department of \nInternational  Cooperation  (DIC)  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investments  (MPI)  will \ncoordinate  and  monitor  CAP  implementation.  It  is  recognized  that  CAP  implementation, \nmonitoring,  reporting,  and  updating  are  challenging  tasks  requiring  both  the  ongoing \ncommitment of lead government agencies and support from development partners. The main \nchallenges are to identify emerging key development issues, lack of capacity in DIC (particularly \nin DIC provincial units) and the SWG secretariats, and lack of capacity and understanding for \nthe role of a more program-based approach to better aid coordination and effectiveness.  \n \n4.  ADB has long provided support in key sectors and is therefore well-positioned to provide \nthe proposed TA. The TA will complement this support and further enhance effectiveness and \ndevelopment results. The improved strategic approach to partnering and harmonization in the \nrevised country partnership strategy guidelines provided a framework for meeting ADB\u2019s Paris \nDeclaration commitments. An Operations Evaluation Department evaluation found that ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in national poverty reduction strategies and local harmonization action plans has \nhelped define its comparative advantage and clarify the rationale for its strategic partnerships.3 \nFurther, there is greater possibility of alignment between aid agencies, including ADB, and \ncountry systems if reform is led by the countries in partnership with the aid agencies. \n  \n5.  Under NSEDP6, the Government has committed to further strengthen the alignment \nbetween  aid-financed public  investments,  the  resources required  to  ensure  their  sustained \noperation  and  maintenance,  and  the  capacities  required  to  implement  public  investment \neffectively.  The  Government  is  leading  the  development  partner  coordination.  The  core \ncoordination mechanism is the roundtable meeting process (RTP), chaired by the Government \nand  supported  by  UNDP.  Roundtable  meetings  take  place  every  3  years,  and  roundtable \nimplementation meetings (RTIMs) are held annually. These allow high-level discussion between \nsenior government officials and the development partners on national plans, strategies, reform \ninitiatives, MDG progress, and resource mobilization. Consultations on specific issues among \nSWGs, the Government, and development partners that precede RTIMs provide complementary \nforums for policy discussion. Limited capacity across government agencies, however, influences \nthe nature of discussions. To create a genuine discussion process and a key development \nagenda,  selecting  discussion  topics,  preparing  papers,  discussing  arrangements,  and \nmonitoring of agreed action plans need to improve. \n \n6.  Overall aid coordination and management is the responsibility of MPI. The Ministry of \nFinance is responsible for negotiating and entering into agreements for ODA provided in the \nform  of  loans  and  grants.  Line  ministries  are  responsible  for  planning,  coordinating,  and \nimplementing ODA in their respective sectors.  \n \n7.  The CAP to implement the Vientiane Declaration was prepared by a task force and \nadopted by the Government and development partners at a high-level forum in May 2007.

Manila. \n ", "      3 \nforum also endorsed the idea of an aid effectiveness secretariat to oversee implementation of \nthe CAP. The agreed indicators and targets of the CAP, which specifies 78 time-bound actions \nunder the five principles of ownership, alignment, harmonization and simplification, managing \nfor results, and mutual accountability, were based mainly on the Government\u2019s ODA survey \nbaseline data. This established the benchmarks to measure progress. The CAP also identifies \nthe  responsible  parties  for  each  action.  The  Government  has  recently  undertaken  a  CAP \nassessment, and a consolidated report was shared with stakeholders at the November 2008 \nRTIM. To effectively implement and monitor CAP progress, it is necessary to further improve the \naid  information  management  system  currently  focused  on  inputs  and  enhance  analytical \ncapacity of DIC units\u2019 staff at selected provincial levels. \n \n8.  In April 2006, the Government established eight SWGs with multi-development partner \nsupport in the areas of health, education, infrastructure, rural development and natural resource \nmanagement, governance, macroeconomics and private sector, mine action, and drug control. \nThese SWGs, which are chaired by the Government and cochaired by development partners, \nare important mechanisms for coordination and dialogue with the development partners. The \ntwo SWGs for infrastructure sector and for macroeconomics and private sector are cochaired by \nADB. A review of SWGs made by DIC in May 2007 found that the SWGs\u2019 functioning is not \neven across sectors. In light of these findings, DIC has initiated actions to strengthen the SWGs. \nAs  an  initial  step,  terms  of  reference  and  work  plans  were  prepared  for  each  SWG. \nNevertheless,  more  systematic  approaches  should  be  developed  to  ensure  effective  aid \ncoordination within sectors and themes. Peer-to-peer learning among SWGs on a sector-wide \napproach is necessary. \n \n9.  ADB  maintains  close  cooperation  and  collaboration  with  major  bilateral  and  other \nmultilateral development partners in Lao PDR. ADB is a member of the United Nations country \nteam and an active member of relevant sector and thematic working groups and the quarterly \ninformal development partner group. It has strongly supported the roundtable process. ADB is a \nsignatory  to  the  Vientiane  Declaration  and  has  supported  development  of  the  CAP  by \nparticipating in the high-level forum and task force. ADB supports the Government\u2019s initiative to \nmove toward programmatic approaches in the core sectors (education, health, agriculture, and \ninfrastructure) through a multipartner effort and coherent program of loans, grants, and TA \nproducts and services. UNDP has developed an overall aid-effectiveness framework in close \ncoordination with the Government and development partners, including ADB, the European \nCommission,  and  the  World  Bank.  UNDP  and  the  Government  have  requested  that  ADB \nparticipate  in  the  agreed  framework  and  provide  necessary  assistance  to  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity in selected areas to manage its ODA program. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  Impact. The TA will assist the Government to further develop its capacity to improve aid \neffectiveness in collaboration with the RTP. \n   \n11.  Expected Outputs and Outcomes. The expected outcome is for the Government to \nexercise effective leadership in coordinating aid to be supported by three outputs: (i) a further \nstrengthened  RTP  coordination  process,  and  in  particular  the  infrastructure  and \nmacroeconomics and private sectors; (ii) enhanced capacity of DIC units in managing aid at one \nto three selected provinces; and (iii) strengthened capacity of the SWG secretariats and line \nministries to coordinate policy and program approaches in the infrastructure sector and the \nmacroeconomics and private sector. \n ", "4   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA was prepared in close coordination with other development partners to provide \nparallel  cofinancing  for  selected  activities  of  UNDP  and  Luxembourg\u2019s  ongoing  project  of \nEnriching the Roundtable Process for Increased Aid Effectiveness and Development Results. \nThis TA will improve the RTP, strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to implement the CAP, \nimprove access to accurate and predictable ODA information, enable increased integration of \nODA  into  national  planning  and  budgeting,  improve  coordination  and  harmonization  of \ndevelopment activities, and develop monitoring functions to assess the effectiveness of ODA in \nachieving development results and progress toward the MDGs within NSEDP. Support under \nthe TA is part of the Government\u2019s larger agenda on improving aid effectiveness. That agenda \nincludes implementation of the Vientiane Declaration with a focus on aid-effectiveness reforms \nand support for more programmatic and sector-based assistance. The TA will build capacity of \nselected institutions (while considering staff turnover) that play catalytic roles in leading the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to improve the use of ODA. Capacity building will employ a process \napproach in which tasks are planned and executed by a team consisting of officials responsible \nfor aid management in participating implementing agencies and TA-supported advisors. In many \ninstances, additional support will be provided by other development partners. The approaches \nidentified will be pilot tested, and a combination of guidelines, seminars, and training programs \n(involving the counterpart officers as trainers) will be used to build awareness and scale up \nimproved aid-effectiveness initiatives.  \n  \n13.  The TA\u2019s key activities will include (i) providing input to the Government for preparing the \nnext NSEDP; (ii) identifying emerging key development issues in the infrastructure sector and \nmacroeconomics and private sector for RTP discussion in close coordination with MPI, the \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), and key development partners; (iii) supporting \nand building capacity of MPI and MPWT to prepare discussion papers on key issues in the \ninfrastructure sector and macroeconomics and private sector; (iv) supporting DIC to prepare a \nplan and build capacity of Department of Planning and Cooperation, MPWT, and DIC provincial \nunits in one to three selected provinces to strengthen development partner coordination; (v) \ntraining DIC units\u2019 staff at selected provincial levels, consistent with the RTP and based on a \ncapacity building strategy focusing not only at the individual level but also at the institutional \nlevel and which includes mentoring; (vi) developing manuals and training the SWG secretariats \nfor aid effectiveness in the infrastructure sector and macroeconomics and private sector; (vii) \ndeveloping manuals and training line ministries to strengthen development partner coordination \nand develop a program-based approach in the infrastructure sector and macroeconomics and \nprivate sector; and (viii) hosting strategic consultations on sector-specific issues to foster and \nfacilitate cross-ministry (and/or cross-agency) and cross-development partner cooperation in \nimplementing agreed aid-effectiveness reforms.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to \n$100,000, through the provision of counterpart personnel, office spaces, resource center spaces, \nnecessary equipment and facilities for counterpart staff, administrative and logistic support, and \nother  related  services.  The  fact-finding  mission  was  assured  by  the  Government  that  the \ncounterpart services, facilities, and funds will be available as required for the implementation \nschedule. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "      5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  TA implementation will last 24 months, from December 2008 to November 2010. The \nDIC will be the Executing Agency for the TA, but administration of the TA will remain with ADB. \nThe TA will be implemented in close coordination with various departments of MPI, MPWT, and \nthe External Financial Relations Department of the Ministry of Finance, as well as with UNDP \nand Luxembourg\u2019s ongoing project of Enriching the Roundtable Process for Increased Aid \nEffectiveness and Development Results. The TA will be located in DIC, but consultants will also \nwork in MPWT. DIC\u2019s Director General will provide oversight, monitor and guide implementation \nof the TA, and resolve issues that may arise in the implementation of the TA. DIC will report on \nand disseminate the results of the TA. In that the TA is implemented as a cofinanced project in \nparallel with the foregoing UNDP- and Luxembourg-financed support, and in that the activities of \nthis TA also support the concurrent outputs of similar initiatives of other development partners \nand the Government\u2019s own efforts, the DIC reporting on enhanced aid effectiveness will be in \nconsolidated  quarterly reports  and  an  annual  report.  Final  responsibility  for  the  support  to \nconsolidate DIC reports rests with the UNDP and Luxembourg project. In addition, the TA \nconsultants  will  prepare  reports  to  ADB  on  their  assignment  in  accordance  with  terms  of \nreference. As the chair of the CAP secretariat, DIC is leading implementation of the CAP on aid \neffectiveness and guides and oversees the activities of the SWGs comprised of government \nofficials from the relevant ministries. \n \n16.  To achieve TA outcomes a firm will be recruited, following the quality- and cost-based \nselection method after submission of a simplified technical proposal, to provide 10 person-\nmonths of international and 24 person-months of national consulting services (Appendix 3) in \nthe  form  of  (i)  1  international  aid-effectiveness  expert  and  team  leader  (8  person-months \nintermittently); (ii) 1 national aid management expert and deputy team leader (14 person-months \nintermittently); and (iii) 1 national capacity development expert (8 person-months intermittently). \nIn addition, a number of resource persons (in total 2 person-months of international consultants \nand 2 person-months of national consultants) will be engaged to support capacity building and \ntraining, support preparation of discussion papers on key emerging issues, and discuss findings \nat forums, seminars, and workshops. The consultant firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Selection of \nthe  consultant  firm  will  be  done  by  a  committee  with  representatives  from  ADB  and  the \nGovernment.  \n \n17.  Equipment (3 desktop computers with printers, 3 notebook computers, 1 scanner, 1 \nphotocopier, 6 air-conditioners, 8 mobile phones, and office furniture), transport (air and rented \nvehicle), and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured using the shopping method \nand in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (February 2007, as amended from time \nto time). At the end of the TA, the procured equipment will be turned over to the relevant \ngovernment agency using it.  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  Capacity  Strengthening  for \nEnhancing Aid Effectiveness, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  6 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets and/or  Reporting  and Risks \nIndicators  Mechanisms  \nImpact  (i) Alignment with  \u2022  Annual review  Assumption \nImproved aid  principles of the  meetings  \u2022  Continued \neffectiveness  Vientiane Declaration  \u2022  DIC reports  commitment from the \non Aid Effectiveness  \u2022  Reports from  Government and \nand CAP,  roundtable  development partners \n(ii) 33% of ODA  implementation  \u2022  Baselines established \ndelivered through  meetings  and agreed \nprogram-based  \u2022  CAP monitoring \napproaches by fiscal  reports \nyear 2011, \n\u2022  National budgets \n(iii) 85% of ODA \nrecorded in the \nnational budget by \nfiscal year 2011, and \n(iv) gap between \ndevelopment \npartner\u2019s disbursed \nODA and that \nrecorded by \nGovernment as \ndisbursed reduced to \n15% by fiscal year \n2011 \nOutcome  (i) DIC functions  \u2022  DIC reports  Assumption \nGovernment  effectively to lead  \u2022  Reports from  \u2022  Continued openness \nexercises effective  cross-ministry aid  roundtable  of the Government \nleadership in  utilization reform  implementation  and development \ncoordinating aid.  effort, and  meetings  partners in sharing \n  (ii) implementation of  \u2022  CAP monitoring  data and information \nthe CAP by fiscal  reports   Risk \nyear 2011  \u2022  Development  \u2022  Sustainability of \npartner survey  capacity building \nefforts \nOutputs  1a.
