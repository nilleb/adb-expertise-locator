INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 1998, the Government of Sri Lanka took steps to modernize the general education \nsystem in accordance with the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on General \nEducation. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) responded to this reform initiative by providing \nfinancial assistance to modernize secondary education.1 As the Project is being implemented \nsmoothly, the Government has requested, and ADB has agreed, to include a loan for a school \ncomputerization project for 2004 in the Sri Lanka Country Strategy and Program Update 2002\u2013\n2004.2 The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from \n18 to 26 July 2002, and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Although gross national product per capita was only $821 in 2001, the literacy rate in Sri \nLanka is over 90% and its social indicators are similar to those of countries with much higher \nincomes. The country ranked 84th among 174 countries in the United Nations Development \nProgramme's  2000  human  development  index.  Sri  Lanka  has  provided  access  to  basic \neducation  for  most  of  its  children.  The  Government  plans  to  provide  universal  access  to \neducation  through  age  18  as  a  part  of  the  National  Education  Strategy  and  the  Teacher \nEducation Strategy prepared by the National Education Commission (NEC) in 1995. It also \nprepared the Higher Education Strategy and the General Education Strategy in 1996. However, \nthe country has not been able to translate these achievements into sustainable economic \ngrowth. The rural poor, especially, have not had the access to resources necessary to acquire \nemployable skills. \n \n3.  Sri  Lanka  has  9  years  of  basic  education,  and  4  years  of  secondary  education \ncomprising 2 years of ordinary study (O-level, grades 10-11) and 2 years of advanced study (A-\nlevel, grades 12-13). According to the school census of 2001, about 4.2 million students were in \n9,887 schools with 194,104 teachers. Schools are of three types: type-1 is divided into 1AB (584 \nfull-curriculum secondary schools offering courses in science, commerce, and the arts) and 1C \n(1,844 limited-curriculum secondary schools offering courses in either commerce or the arts, or \nboth). Mostly in urban areas, type-1 schools are often better equipped and staffed than type-2 or \n-3 schools, which are rural and have a lower quality of education, and whose students are thus \nmore likely to perform poorly in national examinations. \n \n4.  The education sector faces problems of quality and efficiency. Teachers in primary and \nsecondary schools need further professional development. Graduate teachers make up only \n26.5% (51,532) of all teachers. Teachers are not effective partly because they lack proper \ntraining  in  modern  teaching  methods  using  computers  and  other  information  and \ncommunications technology (ICT). Absenteeism among teachers is high and their motivation to \nteach low. Many teachers tutor privately, particularly in urban areas, to supplement their low \nincome. As the training of teachers requires much funds and time, the conventional teacher \ntraining  method  must  be  complemented  by  modern  techniques  such  as  microteaching, \ncomputer-based education, and web-based training. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Education Modernization Project. Manila. The project \nwas approved on 12 September 2000, for $49.58 million. \n2  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2002-2004)  for  Sri  Lanka  lists  it  as  Secondary  Education \nComputerization Project. The title of the project will be reviewed during the TA implementation. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August 2002 (internet version). ", "2 \n5.  Efficiency  of  schooling  is  generally  low.  About  35%  of  students  pass  the  O-level \nexamination, and 45% pass the A-level. Although about 90% of students complete grade 11, \nonly one third continue to grade 12, as most are unable to pass the O-level examination; 15% of \ngrade-11 students fail all subjects on the O-level examination.4 Although no specific data is \navailable, the school dropout rate is reported to be high, especially at higher grades. Student-\nteacher ratios range from 24:1 (primary grades) to 19:1 (secondary grades). By international \nstandards, these rates are low and result in low efficiency and high costs.  \n \n6.  The Government, therefore, adopted the General Education Strategy prepared by NEC \nand set the following priorities: (i) upgrade the quality of educational materials; (ii) increase \navailability of trained teachers, particularly in rural areas; (iii) supply adequate educational \nfacilities such as computer centers, libraries, and science laboratories; and (iv) increase the \nresponsiveness of technical and tertiary education to solve skilled-worker shortages. To improve \nthe  quality  of  secondary  education,  ADB  helps  the  Government  (i)  train  teachers  to  use \ncomputers, (ii) procure computers for 800 schools, and (iii) modernize the national examination \nadministration under the Secondary Education Modernization Project. The World Bank provided \ncomputers to 400 schools, built libraries, and provided library books and computer software.5 \nADB  is  also  processing  a  postsecondary  education  modernization  project  to  support  new \ntechnologies in the form of distance learning to teach employable skills to the educated poor in \ntowns and rural areas nationwide. \n \n7.  Computers have been in schools for a quarter of a century in most advanced countries. \nThe  information  revolution  continues  to  gather  momentum,  and  production  of  wealth  is \nincreasingly knowledge based. Yet the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka do not have \ncomputers and most teachers do not feel able to integrate computer use into the curriculum in \nan educationally productive way. A substantial number of students have no opportunity to use \ncomputers. If this situation is not corrected immediately, it will lead to a digital divide in addition \nto the economic divide. Using ICT will substantially reduce education costs as the return on \ninvestment in ICT is 50\u2013300%. \n \n8.  Even  though  teachers\u2019  absenteeism  has  been  reduced,  it  can  not  be  eliminated \ncompletely. To counter it and poor-quality instruction, new technologies must be employed to \nconvey  the  knowledge  of  experienced  teachers  to  students  and  other  teachers.  New \ntechnologies can be used by students who miss classes or want to review lessons or study \nadvanced  topics  on  their  own.  Teachers  can  learn  how  to  teach  certain  concepts  more \neffectively. However, the content, language, and format of delivery (video tape, television, CD-\nROM, DVD, and web) should be studied to suit the local situation. Only 12% of schools receive \ncomputers. A system should be set up to share this scarce commodity equally among schools. \nLibraries are underutilized as they do not have enough books or up-to-date information. \n \n9.  Bilateral funding agencies are active in education. Most bilateral assistance has pilot \nprograms for primary education, including assistance for English-language teaching, plantation \nschools in mountain areas, and schools in areas of social conflict. In addition to ADB, the World \nBank is providing computers to secondary schools to promote computer literacy. The Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  is  interested  in  supporting  ICT-aided  teaching  of \n                                                 \n4  This issue is being addressed by ADB's Secondary Education Modernization Project, approved on 12 September \n2000, for $49.58 million. \n5  World Bank. 1997.

ADB\u2019s country operational strategy emphasizes the importance of human development \nto promote continued economic growth and closer integration into the global economy. As the \nbiggest cause of poverty is the civil conflict, ADB will help the Government reduce conflict-\nrelated poverty (Appendix 1). The proposed TA will also explore the possibility of providing \nselective rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to conflict-affected areas, targeting job \ncreation, especially for the youth and the poor. ADB\u2019s Policy on Education7 puts high priority on \n(i) improving the quality of education; (ii) increasing equity, access, and retention, especially for \nthe  poor,  women,  and  other  marginalized  groups;  and  (iii)  strengthening  management, \ngovernance, and efficiency. The proposed assistance is fully in line with ADB\u2019s education policy \nand  country  strategy  in  that  it  aims  to  improve  quality  of  education  and  develop  human \nresources for the information age.  \n \n11.  Frequent  changes  of  institutions  and  personnel  in  Sri  Lanka  often  delay  project \nimplementation. Short institutional memory also results in differences in philosophy and project \ndesign. A broad consensus among stakeholders is, therefore, necessary. Continuous dialogue \nand intensive workshops with the stakeholders will be conducive to building consensus. A \nproject director who can serve the whole duration of the Project must be appointed to reduce \nmisunderstandings and differences in opinions during project implementation. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The overall objective of the TA is to prepare an investment project to support the \nGovernment's strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of school education to meet new \nlabor  market  requirements.  The  potential  role  of  ICT  in  enhancing  education  quality  and \nefficiency will be assessed to overcome problems such as poorly qualified teaching staff and \nlack of instructional materials. The Project will target poor and disadvantaged youths in rural \nareas (type-2 and -3 schools) and conflict-affected areas. The Project is expected to contribute \nto reducing the digital divide and in preparing students for ICT-related jobs.  \n \n13.  Key outputs of the TA will include (i) a situation, needs, and background analysis of the \npotential role of ICT in enhancing education quality; (ii) an ICT action plan with prioritized \nstrategies and an investment plan; and (iii) based on the ICT action plan, an investment project \nthat will use ICT to help enhance education quality. The pilot Community Information Services \nProject is being considered to test the sustainability of the investment project, with focus on \nrecovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will have three components: (i) a comprehensive study and detailed survey on \nintroducing ICT in schools, (ii) an action plan to implement the national ICT policy, and (iii) a \nplan to build capacity of school administrators and teachers in the use of ICT.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The Government and the Mission agreed to support the finalization of the National ICT Policy under the ADB's \nongoing Science and Technology Personnel Development Project, approved on 11 September 1997, for $20 \nmillion. Under the proposed TA, an action plan to implement the National ICT Policy in education will be developed. \n7  ADB. 2002. Policy on Education. Manila. ", "4 \n15.  A comprehensive survey will review the current status of school education, its problems, \nand ongoing measures to correct them. Information needs of schools and communities will be \nassessed to meet labor market demand for ICT workers. Based on the survey results and needs \nassessment, a plan to introduce ICT in schools will be drafted in consultation with policymakers, \nschool administrators, teachers, students, and community leaders. The plan will take a cluster \napproach to providing equal access to ICT by students, regardless of their residence and \nincome. \n \n16.  Considering the poor state of libraries in schools and high cost of purchasing and \ndisseminating learning materials, a master plan to develop educational materials will be drafted. \nIt will include (i) kinds of instructional materials to be developed, (ii) suitable media format for \nthem, (iii) a dissemination and utilization plan, and (iv) an updating plan. These plans and \nmethods will be compiled into a manual for easy reference. \n \n17.  As  teachers\u2019  capacity  to  utilize  ICT  is  low,  a  comprehensive  plan  to  upgrade  the \nteachers\u2019  knowledge  and  skills  will  be  drafted  under  the  TA.  A  separate  program  will  be \ndeveloped for school administrators. Ways to maximize utilization of the private sector will also \nbe explored. These plans will be pilot-tested before being finalized. A few workshops will be \nconducted to secure trainers of ICT trainers and employ ICT to encourage behavioral change to \nimprove education quality and efficiency. \n \n18.  Performance indicators will be collected under the TA to assess the impact of ICT in \nschools. The indicators include (i) modes of using ICT in schools, (ii) number of teachers and \nstudents benefited by ICT, (iii) level of computer literacy of students and teachers, (iv) data on \nstudents\u2019 academic achievement, (v) extent of community support for use of ICT in schools, (vi) \nproper O&M of facilities and equipment, and (vii) ability to cover O&M costs. Baseline data will \nbe  collected  under  the  TA  for  future  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project.  TA \nimplementation has no major risks as it starts with an assessment of the stakeholders' needs. \nTo ensure maximum participation of stakeholders in the design of the investment project, the TA \nteam will consult the donors and stakeholders frequently. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent, comprising $335,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost,  and  $295,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance \n$500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of $335,000, and $165,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government\u2019s contribution of $130,000 equivalent will \nbe in kind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing plan are in Appendix \n2. Cofinancing opportunities are being sought mainly to build teachers\u2019 capacity in ICT. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The  Ministry  of  Human  Resource  Development,  Education,  and  Cultural  Affairs \n(MHECA) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A team of three international and three \ndomestic consultants will be recruited to provide specialist services, totaling 22 person-months. \nInternational consultants will include (i) an educational technology specialist cum team leader (5 \nperson-months), (ii) an educational media specialist (3), and (iii) a school librarian (2). The \ndomestic consultants include (i) a financial analyst (4 person-months), (ii) an information survey \nspecialist (5), and (iii) a social development specialist (3). The outline terms of reference of the ", "    5 \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Using quality-and-cost-based selection method in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engagement of domestic consultants, ADB will engage the consultants through a firm. The \nsimplified technical proposal format will be used. The consulting firm will procure equipment and \nsoftware in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. The equipment and software \nprocured will be transferred to the Government upon TA completion. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months, February-September 2003. The consulting \nteam will arrive in Colombo on or around 15 February 2003, to prepare the feasibility study, \nincluding  rationale,  design,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  equipment  list, \nassessment of procurement arrangements, project monitoring program, and policy agenda. An \ninterim report will be submitted to MHECA and ADB at the end of the fourth month (around 15 \nJune 2003). Draft reports will be submitted to MHECA and ADB during the sixth month (15 \nAugust 2003), and final reports during the seventh month (15 September 2003). A tripartite  \nreview meeting of Government, consultants, and ADB will discuss the draft final report, and, \nbased on the feedback, the consultants will submit a final report. A final workshop will be \norganized around September 2003 in Sri Lanka to design an investment project based on the \nconsultants' final report and other inputs. \n \n22.  The Government will appoint a project manager and six counterpart staff to work with the \nteam of consultants recruited under the TA. The TA will be closely coordinated with the ongoing \nSecondary Education Modernization Project. The Government will also provide adequate office \nspace and administrative support to the consultants.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for preparing the School Computerization Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in (DMC):  \n \nAccording to a Government survey, the incidence of poverty declines as the level of education attained rises.  The \nincidence of poverty is highest in those households where the principle income earner has no schooling, lowest in \nthose where the principle income earner is a graduate of university. The project takes into account the access to and \nquality of education for poor rural children.  To increase equal access to quality education, the project will implement a \nmore equitable and sustainable allocation of computers, text books and other learning resources with effective \nteaching methods.  This will increase the learning outcomes of school children in an equitable manner and contribute \nto reducing poverty and digital divide.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: PI  \n \nBetween 25 and 39 percent of the population can be classified as poor in Sri Lanka.  Poverty is predominately a rural \nphenomenon with nearly 90 percent of the poor residing in rural areas.   Therefore, one of the central objectives of the \nGovernment is to restore economic growth and thereby effectively eliminate poverty in the country.   Six major pillars \nof the Government\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction are: (i) investing in people, (ii) creating opportunities for the poor to \nparticipate in economic growth, (iii) reducing conflict-related poverty, (iv) building a supportive macroeconomic \nenvironment, (v) empowering the poor and strengthening governance, and (vi) implementing an effective monitoring \nand evaluation system.  The project will support the first three pillars by teaching computer skills that will open up their \nopportunities especially in the rural and conflict areas. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis: \n \nThe project was developed through extensive consultation with central and local governments and rural communities.  \nThe project also reflected the needs of students, teachers and school administrators. To ensure local ownership of the \nproject community contribution was encouraged through School Development Society.  The contributions take the \nform of donation of cash, supplies, labor and expertise.  In return, the project will share its information and resources \nwith the stakeholders and seek their active involvement.  This consultation process will be continued during the TA \nimplementation as well as the proposed loan project. \n \nParticipation strategy required:  No \n \n \nD.
