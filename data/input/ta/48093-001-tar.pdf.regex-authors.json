During the 2013 country program mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  the  government  requested  that  ADB  provide  technical \nassistance (TA) to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to support the \npreparation of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (13th plan). ADB has included the proposed policy \nand advisory TA in the 2014 TA pipeline for the PRC. \n \n2.  An ADB team met with the NDRC on 9 January 2014 to discuss the direction, objective, \nkey topics to be covered, and timing of the TA. ADB and NDRC initially agreed on (i) the \nobjective of the study, which is to help the PRC avoid the middle-income trap and achieve more \ninclusive growth and sustainable development; and (ii) the key areas (or challenges) to be \ncovered\u2014industrial  transformation,  rural\u2013urban  transformation,  and  human  resource \ntransformation.1 The NDRC informed the ADB team that all deliverables of the TA should be \nsubmitted to the NDRC by 30 November 2014 for the agency to include the materials as part of \nits overall submission to the State Council for the 13th plan. \n \n3.  A follow-up meeting was conducted with the NDRC on 21 January 2014 to discuss the \nkey issues to be covered, expected outputs, and the next steps. The NDRC reaffirmed the three \nkey areas and suggested three additional areas\u2014the challenge of ecological and environmental \ndegradation  and  climate  change,  debt  management,  and  integration  of  the  PRC  with  the \ninternational  community.  Both  sides  agreed  that  this  TA  will  focus  on  three  principal  key \nchallenges\u2014industrial  transformation,  rural\u2013urban  transformation,  and  human  resource \ntransformation. ADB will draw on ADB-wide expertise and resources to address the other three \nchallenges in a comprehensive and effective way by building on existing work. \n \n4.  An ADB fact-finding mission met with the NDRC on 19 February 2014 to refine the TA \ndesign  and  implementation  arrangements.  This  TA  report  is  based  on  the  understanding \nreached  between  the  NDRC  and  ADB  regarding  the  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing plan, and terms of reference for consultants. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The economic performance of the PRC has been spectacular over the last 3 decades. \nGross domestic product growth has averaged about 9% per year and per capita income has \nincreased by a factor of 13. Rapid growth has led to significant improvement in human well-\nbeing and quality of life. From the early 1980s to the late 2000s, the incidence of $1.25-a-day \npoverty declined from 85% to about 13%; life expectancy at birth increased from 67 to 73 years; \nand child mortality under the age of 5 years declined from 65 to 18 deaths per 1,000. Economic \nexpansion has also led to a sharp rise in the country\u2019s influence on the global economy. The \nPRC is now the world\u2019s largest exporter and the second largest economy. \n \n6.  The  PRC\u2019s  impressive  achievements  notwithstanding,  the  country  still  faces  major \nchallenges. With a per capita gross national product of $6,772 in 2013, the PRC has passed the \n                                                 \n1  International experiences show that, in many countries, growth slowed significantly after they attained middle-\nincome status. They find they were caught in what is increasingly known as the \u201cmiddle-income trap.\u201d On one \nhand, they could no longer compete with low-income countries because of rising wages. On the other, they were \nunable to compete with high-income countries because they have not shifted into higher-value production through \ninnovation and industrial upgrading. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 April 2014.  \n ", "2  \nthreshold of upper-middle-income status but still has a long way to go before becoming a high-\nincome country. Given rising wages and population aging, growth will have to be increasingly \ndriven  by  productivity  improvement  through  innovation  and  industrial  upgrading\u2014the  PRC \nneeds to move from a low-cost to a high-value economy. Moreover, rapid growth has exposed \nseveral  structural  problems,  in  particular  economic  imbalances,  rising  inequality,  resource \nconstraints, and environmental degradation. These challenges were highlighted at the Third \nPlenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in the \nDecisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Major Issues \nConcerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform. The latter stated that the market will play \na decisive role in resource allocation. To some extent, these challenges are often associated \nwith rapid structural transformation, although incomplete reform is also a major contributing \nfactor. If not addressed, these problems could hinder the PRC\u2019s efforts in moving toward a high-\nvalue economy, and increase the risk of getting caught in what is increasingly known as the \nmiddle-income trap.3 \n \n7.  The PRC has a long tradition of formulating five-year plans to address development \nchallenges, and promote social and economic development. The plans lay out the strategic \nobjectives of the country, determine work priorities of the government, and provide guidance for \nmarket activities. Since the founding of the PRC, the country has formulated a total of 12 plans; \neach one has had a significant impact on the PRC\u2019s development during the plan period. \nCurrently, implementation of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2010\u20132015 is halfway, and a midterm \nevaluation has been completed.4 Preparation of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 has \njust started, which is a critical period for the PRC as it aims to establish a comparatively well-off \nand  prosperous  society,  and  make  the  transition  from  a  middle-income  to  a  high-income \ncountry.5 \n \n8.  To avoid the middle-income trap, the 13th plan needs to address six key challenges over \nthe  next  5  years:  (i)  industrial  transformation,  (ii)  rural\u2013urban  transformation,  (iii) human \nresource transformation, (iv) the challenge of ecological and environmental degradation and \nclimate  change,  (v)  debt  management,  and  (vi)  further  integration  of  the  PRC  with  the \ninternational community.  \n \n9.  The TA aims to assist the PRC in preparing the 13th plan to overcome the middle-\nincome trap and achieve more inclusive growth and sustainable development. The scope of this \nTA  includes  a  background  analysis  of  the  PRC\u2019s  current  development  and  challenges, \nsocioeconomic structure, growth potential, and internal and external forces that are likely to \ndrive change in the next 5 years. ADB\u2019s knowledge contribution toward the PRC\u2019s preparation of \nthe 13th plan will be made not only through this TA, but also through other recent, ongoing, and \nplanned ADB knowledge work. This TA will primarily focus on three key challenges. \n \n(i)  Industrial  transformation.  The  TA  will  examine  issues  such  as  industrial \nupgrading,  high-quality  service  sector  development,  the  role  of  state-owned \nenterprises  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  the  role  of  the  private \nsector, the power of the market, and financial sector efficiency. Innovation is also \nan important driver for industrial transformation. A key focus is how to promote \ninnovation in the PRC, including looking at innovation policies and/or strategies; \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2012.

The TA will examine issues such as balanced \nrural\u2013urban  development  (e.g.,  inclusive  development,  and  rural  and  urban \ninfrastructure including transport); public service provision and benefits (including \nmigrants); security of land tenure; and equitable benefits from the transfer of \noperating rights, agricultural modernization, and agribusiness transformation.  \n(iii)  Human resource transformation. The TA will examine issues such as surplus \nlabor,  the  aging  population,  human  resource  development,  entrepreneurship, \ncapacity development to support the above transformations, vocational education \nand training, and the role of knowledge. \n \n10.  The TA will analyze the key issues under each of the three areas, and provide policy \nrecommendations. The proposed reforms will be sequenced and linked to the central theme of \novercoming the middle-income trap. \n  \n11.  ADB-wide expertise and resources will be tapped to address the other three challenges, \ndiscussed below, in a comprehensive and effective way by building on existing work (\u201cOne \nADB\u201d  approach).  A  separate  report  on  each  of  these  three  other  challenges  with \nrecommendations will be submitted to the NDRC by 30 November 2014. \n \n(i)  Challenge  of  ecological  and  environmental  degradation  and  climate \nchange.  ADB\u2019s East Asia Department (Environment, Natural Resources and \nAgriculture  Division),  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment will work together to examine key issues relating to ecological and \nenvironmental degradation in the PRC. \n(ii)  Debt  management.  The absolute amount of local government debt appears \nmanageable at present. However, its rapid expansion\u2014outpacing growth of fiscal \nrevenue\u2014coupled with mounting off-budget liabilities, is worrisome and demands \nan improved debt management system. ADB\u2019s East Asia Department (Office of \nthe  Director  General)  will  lead  the  preparation  of  a  separate  study  on  debt \nmanagement.  \n(iii)  Integration of the PRC with the international community. Building on the \nwork  of  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research  Department,  Office  of  Regional \nEconomic Integration, ADB Institute, Office of the General Counsel, and East \nAsia  Department  (Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and  Regional \nCooperation Division); this division of the East Asia Department will lead the \npreparation of a separate study covering the key issues in this area.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be more inclusive growth and sustainable development in the PRC that \novercomes the middle-income trap. The performance indicators include an increased share of \nservices in the gross domestic product from the 2015 baseline, and increased rural per capita \ndisposable income from the 2015 baseline. \n \n ", "4  \n13.  The outcome will be an improved policy and regulatory environment to support industrial \ntransformation  based  on  innovation,  rural\u2013urban  transformation,  and  human  resource \ntransformation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The outputs of this TA will comprise (i) reports: one main report (a synthesis of three \nsub-reports)  and  three  sub-reports  on  (a)  industrial  transformation  (including  innovation), \n(b) rural\u2013urban transformation, and (c) human resource transformation; (ii) workshops; and (iii) \nfield research and dissemination.6 Domestic field research could include visits to provinces with \nan advanced reform agenda and experience in the PRC, and policy dialogue. International field \nresearch could include visits to countries with rich experience in dealing with middle-income trap \nissues. The visits (including location and number) would depend on the research requirement of \nthe TA. Preference will be given to ADB member countries. Moreover, seminars on middle-\nincome  trap  issues  participated  in  by  policy  makers  and  renowned  experts  from  relevant \ncountries  could  be  conducted  to  bring  in  more  international  experience.  In  addition,  a \ndissemination event in the form of a press conference will be held in Beijing to disseminate the \nresearch results, and senior officials from the NDRC and ADB will attend. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $960,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, relevant data \nand information, assistance in arranging meetings and field visits with relevant government \nagencies, logistics support, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government\u2019s in-\nkind contribution is estimated to account for 20% of the total TA cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing and implementing agency will be the Planning Department of the NDRC. \nA total of 33 person-months of individual consulting services (two international consultants for \n9 person-months and four national consultants for a total of 24 person-months) will be provided. \nThe TA will also engage resource persons for workshops and specific technical inputs. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2, and the outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).
