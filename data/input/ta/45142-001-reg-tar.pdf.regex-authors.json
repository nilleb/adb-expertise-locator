INTRODUCTION \n1.  The global financial crisis that emerged from the meltdown of the mortgage market in the \nUnited States in 2007 and spread to the world in 2008\u20132009 highlighted deficiencies and \nweaknesses  in  the  current  international  financial  architecture  as  well  as  national  financial \nregulatory  systems.  In  response  to  these,  the  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20)  leaders  made \ncommitments to build a more resilient financial system. Subsequently, G-20 finance ministers \nand central bank governors, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, tasked the \nBasel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  and  the  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  to \nrecommend ways to strengthen oversight and supervision of the financial sector, with the aim of \nbuilding a resilient international financial system that can withstand shocks and mitigate their \nadverse effects on the real economy.1 \n \n2.  Much progress has been made since the first commitments made by the G-20 leaders at \nthe Washington summit in November 2008. In accordance with the G-20\u2019s guiding principles, \nthe FSB and its constituents sculpted specific reform proposals to strengthen financial stability. \nThe first concrete outcome was the Basel III package of capital and liquidity reforms, which was \nendorsed by the G-20 leaders at the November 2010 Seoul summit. The new rules are planned \nto be implemented from January 2013 and are expected to be fully phased in by 1 January \n2019.  In  February  2011,  the  FSB  reported  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  G-20 \nrecommendations on financial regulation. The report outlined further work toward dealing with \nsystemically important financial institutions, strengthening the regulation and oversight of the \n\u201cshadow  banking\u201d  system,2 improving  over-the-counter  derivatives  market  and  credit  rating \nagencies,  developing  macro-prudential  frameworks,  and  making  progress  in  international \nharmonization of high-quality accounting standards. \n \n3.  These reforms have focused on strengthening global regulatory guidelines such as the \nBasel III standards, filling the regulatory gaps, and broadening the coverage. However, there is \nnot yet an effective and collaborative implementation mechanism at the national level. As the \nurgency of the crisis fades, the push for reforms also seems to be weakening, which makes it \nharder  to  achieve  the  political  cohesion  needed  to  establish  a  harmonized  cross-border \nregulatory environment. \n \n4.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  as  the  region\u2019s  main  development  bank  and \nmultilateral body for policy counseling, plays an important role in providing an avenue for policy \ndialogues  and  cooperation  in  the  region.  Strategy  20203 underscores  the  importance  of \nproviding knowledge platforms to ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). In addition, \nADB\u2019s recently approved financial sector operational plan prepared by the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration (OREI) aims to respond better to the region\u2019s need for financial sector \ndevelopment and ensure the quality and consistency of its operations.4 This research and \n                                                \n1 In the wake of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, the G-20 had its inaugural meeting, hosted by the German and \nCanadian finance ministers, in Berlin on 15\u201316 December 1999. The G-20 members are Argentina, Australia, \nBrazil, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the \nRepublic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United \nStates, and the European Union, represented by the rotating European Council presidency and the European \nCentral Bank. The G-20 chair rotates between members and is selected from a different regional grouping of \ncountries each year. The chair in 2011 is France. The summit will be held in Cannes in November. \n2  The shadow banking system or the shadow financial system refers to non-depository banks and other financial \ninstitutions such as investment banks, hedge funds, money market funds, and insurers that play an increasingly \nimportant role in lending businesses and behaves like banks by creating credits. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Under this TA, ADB will leverage the existing regional platforms, such as the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+35 meetings, to emphasize the need to \nstrengthen  regional  cooperation  for  financial  regulatory  reforms.  Regional  policy  dialogues \nshould promote adherence to international standards and minimum regulatory principles, and \nensure  adequate  information  on  cross-border  financial  activities  and  effective  knowledge \nsharing. \n \n6.  This TA aims to support regulatory reforms in line with international good practices, \ncovering  the  financial  sector  (banking,  insurance,  and  securities)  of  DMCs  in  East  and \nSoutheast Asia. 6 The TA will examine the relevance of the global reform issues and their \nimplications for emerging Asian economies, strengthen macro-prudential supervision of the \nDMCs through knowledge sharing, and help improve national regulatory systems and promote \nharmonization of national regulations and practices in line with global standards. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n7.  Following the crisis and the G-20 responses to it, significant reforms have taken place to \nbuild a stronger, more globally consistent supervisory and regulatory framework for the financial \nsector. Although these reforms are critical to the future worldwide financial system, emerging \neconomies  expressed  concerns  that  many  issues  focus  on  developed  economies  with \nadvanced financial markets, and that the ongoing reforms may have little direct relevance to the \nchallenges  facing  emerging  economies  and  financial  systems,  especially  those  with  less-\ndeveloped financial systems. \n \n8.  The real challenges are in the implementation of the global guidelines and policies at the \nnational level. First is the implementation of Basel III. Second, the growing cross-border banking \nand financial activities imply that financial oversight must be coordinated internationally. Finally, \nthe region should work with the global community to build solidified defenses against similar \ncrises in the future. The crisis also highlighted the importance of adequate information on cross-\nborder  financial  activities  and  effective  knowledge  sharing.  However,  because  of  the  wide \nspectrum of financial development stages in developing countries, global financial reforms pose \ndifferent challenges to DMCs\u2014although they share important common goal of ensuring that \ndomestic financial regulatory systems keep pace with global standards while promoting financial \nsector development. \n \n9.  The impact of the crisis differed across developing Asian economies depending on the \ndegree of economic and financial openness, as well as the dependency on external demand \nand credit.8 Although exports and growth slowed in some Asian economies, their financial \nsystems remained generally resilient because of their limited exposure to the problem assets. \n                                                \n5 ASEAN+3 countries include the 10 members of ASEAN plus the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the \nRepublic of Korea. \n6  The TA will cover DMCs in East and Southeast Asia. In this document, \u201cDMCs\u201d will refer to countries in those \nregions. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 June 2011. \n8  D. W. Arner and L. Schou-Zibell. 2010. Responding to the Global Financial and Economic Crisis: Meeting the \nChallenges in Asia. ADB Working Paper Series. No. 60. Manila: ADB; and J. W. Lee and C.-Y. Park. 2010. New \nFinancial Reforms and Their Effects on Emerging Asia. ADB Briefs. No. 5. Manila: ADB. \n ", "  3\nTheir relative resilience can also be attributed to the financial reforms undertaken after the \n1997/98 Asian financial crisis, which produced progressive improvements in the underlying \nfinancial infrastructure.  \n \n10.  Despite the region\u2019s generally positive financial sector performance, the global financial \ncrisis again highlights the need to address the remaining reform agendas and issues specific to \nDMCs in the region. DMCs are lagging in their macro-prudential supervisory system to monitor \npotential risks arising from internal and external sectors. The lack of an early warning system, \ntogether with both human and physical capacity constraints, is an impediment to timely analysis \nof the macroeconomic and financial situation. Regulatory and supervisory weaknesses remain \nat  the  micro  level,  especially  in  the  quality  of  regulation,  resolution  of  problem  financial \ninstitutions, and cross-border cooperation. These weaknesses are often detrimental to effective \ncrisis prevention and management by DMCs.9 \n \n11.  The key lesson of the crisis is the need to enhance mechanisms to address economic \nand financial stability. Without collective efforts to secure the stability of the system, the stability \nof an individual economy cannot be guaranteed. To build a more resilient financial system, the \nregion  needs  to  work  on  two  important  fronts.  First  is  the  adoption  of  an  internationally \nconsistent framework that will mandate minimum regulatory principles and guidelines in the \nregion.  The  national  authorities  need  to  strengthen  adherence  to  such  supervisory  and \nregulatory  standards.  Second  is  the  monitoring  and  management  of  capital  flows.  Many \nemerging Asian economies are facing massive capital inflows in the post-crisis period. Large \nand sudden capital inflows tend to push up the local currency value, lead to asset price bubbles, \nand risk overheating the economy. Experiences in many DMCs testify to the risk of volatile \ncapital flows. \n \n12.  Asia\u2019s DMCs need to undertake deeper and more comprehensive reforms to accelerate \nfinancial  sector  development.  For  DMCs,  the  most  important  development  issue  is  the \nfortification of the financial regulatory system, which can contribute to financial stability and \neconomic growth. The region\u2019s policymakers are concerned that the weaknesses of the financial \nregulatory system continue to hold back necessary progress toward responsible finance for the \npoor as well as micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.10 \n \n13.  The TA will address the issues of regulatory reforms from a new post-crisis perspective. \nIt will (i) examine how Asian economies translate the lessons of the recent global financial crisis \ninto appropriate policies and reform measures in terms of macro-prudential supervision relative \nto  micro-prudential  supervision;11 (ii)  assess  the  robustness  of  financial  sector  policies  or \n                                                \n9  In addition to deficiencies in financial regulations, such as capital adequacy, liquidity risk requirements, accounting \nstandards, and resolution of failed institutions, the quality of financial sector supervision has emerged as an \nimportant issue from the financial crisis. Based on an examination of lessons from the crisis and the findings of \nassessments of countries\u2019 compliance with financial standards, a paper identifies the key elements of good \nsupervision\u2014that it is intrusive, skeptical, proactive, comprehensive, adaptive, and conclusive.

SPN/10/08. \nWashington, DC: International Monetary Fund .  \n10 Responsible finance proved to be an important issue for the financial sector, especially during the global financial \ncrisis when importance of transparent, inclusive, sustainable, and equitable financial practices is highlighted. The \nConsultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor  provides  more  details  at  http://www.cgap.org/gm/document-\n1.9.37605/KfW%20Responsible%20finance%20paper.pdf. \n11 The recent global financial crisis showed that the existing framework of financial regulation and supervision (i.e., \nthe micro-prudential framework)\u2014which tends to focus primarily on the stability of individual institutions, markets, \nand infrastructure\u2014underestimates systemic risks. By contrast, the macro-prudential approach to supervision \nfocuses mainly on the financial system as a whole and involves monitoring, assessment, and mitigation of systemic \nrisk\u2014the likelihood of failure of a significant part of the financial system. Thus, macro-prudential framework aims to \n ", "4  \nreforms  to  buffer  any  systemic  vulnerability  to  financial  crises,  and  the  extent  of  their \ncontribution to financial soundness and stability; and (iii) help develop the strategic direction of \nthe financial  policies  and  regulatory  reforms  through  consultations  with  officials from  DMC \nfinance ministries, central banks, and supervisory agencies.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the TA will be improvements in the regulatory systems of the participating \nDMCs  through  sequential  actions  toward  global  standards  and  guidelines  to  address  the \ndeficiency  of  their  financial  regulatory  regimes  and  vulnerability  to  financial  shocks.  With \neffective policy recommendations and action plans for individual DMCs, the TA will lay the \nfoundations for regional initiatives to harmonize regulatory rules and practices with a view to \nstrengthening regional financial and macroeconomic stability. The outcome will be a stronger \nregulatory  framework  through  the  adoption  of  global  standards  and  guidelines  in  the \nparticipating DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA comprises the following activities and outputs: \n(i)  Regional study. A regional study featuring assessments of the existing regimes \nand necessary reforms by the participating DMCs will be published. This will help \nDMCs assess their existing regulatory systems, identify the reforms needed at \nboth the national and regional levels, and provide practical guidelines for Asian \npolicy makers in designing their financial market development plans by mapping \nout  the  framework  for  regulatory  reforms  in  line  with  the  global  guidelines. \nSpecifically, the study will provide an analysis of the following issues relevant to \nthe region: (a) developing a macro-prudential supervisory system, (b) improving \nthe  legal  and  institutional  framework  (especially  with  a  view  to  enhancing \ntransparency and disclosure), and (c) managing capital flows. To provide better \nillustrations and understanding of these issues at the national level, the study will \ninclude selected country case studies. \n(ii)  Workshops  and  seminars.  Workshops  and  seminars  will  be  conducted  to \nincrease awareness of the issues on financial regulatory reforms, provide venues \nfor policy debates, and disseminate research outputs and recommendations. \n \n16.  The regional study together with four working papers under this TA will involve research, \nconsultations, and statistical analysis. Partnerships with the World Bank and other international \nfinancial institutions or international standard setters will be explored for the purposes of building \ndatabases and conducting workshops and seminars.12 Strong collaboration with ADB regional \n                                                                                                                                                       \nprevent or at least contain the potential risks derived from financial and macroeconomic imbalances and ensure \nthat the financial system is able both to withstand shocks and to dampen their effects on the real economy. \n12 The World Bank proposed a joint Asia regional study in 2010. The TA is a response to that proposal. The study \njointly conducted by ADB and the World Bank, Financial Stability Regulatory Reforms: Lessons from Global \nFinancial Crisis for Asia Region, aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of how Asian economies responded to \nthe global financial crisis and translate the lessons from the crisis into the Asian context. The original proposal \nincluded six topics: (i) reassessing the regulatory and supervisory framework, (ii) corporate governance and \nexcessive risk taking, (iii) crisis management mechanisms (debt resolution regimes and insolvency laws), (iv) \nenhancing transparency and disclosure, (v) asset bubbles and macro-prudential surveillance, and (vi) improving \naccess to finance. Given the budget constraint and the region\u2019s priorities, the scope of the study was narrowed to \nfour major themes listed in this TA paper. The partnership will be valuable to ADB's knowledge operations as it will \nenable ADB to access a wider research network and tap a larger pool of talent and broader range of expertise, \nespecially in terms of financial sector assessment. \n ", "  5\ndepartments will be essential to increase access to information by DMCs, maximize the study\u2019s \noperational  value,  and  utilize  existing  studies  by  regional  departments  for  more  advanced \nanalysis of macroeconomic and financial links for DMCs. This collaboration could feed into the \nprogram or project designs to help governments put in place more robust macro-prudential \nframeworks to avert similar crises. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  use  ADB\u2019s  new  financial  sector  operational  plan  in  formulating  its \nrecommendations and reforms to meet the selected DMCs\u2019 financial sector development needs. \nLinking the TA outputs to the operational plan will help provide more consistent and institution-\nwide assistance to DMCs and strengthen ADB\u2019s financial sector development operations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which (i) the equivalent of $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund; \nand (ii) the equivalent of $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Financial Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Fund, both administered by ADB.13 The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented by OREI from \nSeptember 2011 to July 2014.14 Six international consultants with an estimated 20 person-\nmonths of consulting services and four national consultants with 71 person-months of consulting \nservices will assist in the implementation of the TA. Resource persons for workshops and \nseminars will also be engaged. \n \n20.  The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Individual consultants and \nresource persons will be hired according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time). TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, amended from time to time). \n \n21.  ADB will purchase equipment (e.g., computer hardware and software, databases) in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After the TA is completed, any equipment that was \nprocured  will  be  disposed  of  in  compliance  with  the  project  administration  instructions  on \nadministering grant-financed TA.15 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000, to be financed on \na grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000, to be financed on \na grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund for Financial Regulatory \nReforms in Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n13 Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg \n14  Dissemination activities will commence in 2014 and outcome evaluation will be undertaken during review missions. \n15 ADB. 2009.
