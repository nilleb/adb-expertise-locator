INTRODUCTION \n1.  Subsidies  are  one  of  the  many  policy  instruments  used  by  governments  to  attain \nsocioeconomic  development  objectives.  Fossil-fuel  subsidies,  in  particular,  serve  such \nobjectives by providing incentives to energy producers through an increase in  price or by \nredistributing wealth to the poor by reducing the price of energy products. Subsidies, however, \nalter behavior in a way that undermines their very objective. Fossil-fuel subsidies result in either \nexcessive production or consumption, sending wrong signals that distort markets and produce \nuneconomic  outcomes.  And  because  of  the  premium  given  to  fossil-fuels  through  these \nsubsidies,  they  also  discourage  the  development  and  deployment  of  renewable  and  more \nefficient, cleaner forms of energy. \n \n2.  At their summit on November 2010, leaders of the Group of Twenty (G-20) countries \nagreed to \u2015rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies.\u2016 \nThere is recognition that the timing has to be based on national circumstances and targeted \nsupport has to be provided for the poorest.1 The joint report to the G-20 by the International \nEnergy  Agency  and  three  other  major  organizations  estimates  that  phasing  out  fossil-fuel \nsubsidies could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in 2050 compared with the business-\nas-usual scenario.2 Rationalization of these subsidies will also free funds for other uses. Such \nsavings could increase the social protection budget to enable the poor to cope with higher \nenergy prices. The funds may alternatively be used to improve the welfare of the poor by \nproviding them access to affordable modern energy services while reducing the health hazards \nthey face from the use of fossil fuels. Finally, these savings could be directed toward supporting \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy to help shift economies to a low-carbon growth path. \n \n3.  The 2008 Technical Assistance Strategic Forum of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nestablished the major areas for research through ADB's research and development technical \nassistance  (TA)  program.  For  2009\u20132011,  the  five  strategic  priorities  for  research  are \n(i) promoting  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  addressing  climate  change,  (iii) facilitating  knowledge  for \nregional  integration,  (iv) providing  support  to  address  increasing  commodity  prices,  and \n(v) assessing and responding to demographic change. This TA will address priority areas (i), (ii), \nand (iv) of the Forum by generating knowledge products on inclusive growth, climate change, \nand rising energy prices for sustainable development. \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  According  to  the  World  Energy  Outlook  2010,  fossil-fuel  consumption  subsidies \nworldwide reached $312 billion in 2009. This varies widely with fluctuations in international \nenergy prices, and differences in national pricing policies, exchange rates, and consumption \nlevels. Countries with the highest subsidies in absolute terms in 2009 were those that are \nendowed with substantial energy resources: Iran ($66 billion), Saudi Arabia ($35 billion), and the \nRussian Federation ($34 billion). Among the net importing countries with the highest subsidies \nin absolute terms were India ($21 billion) and the People\u2019s Republic of China ($19 billion), but \ntheir subsidies were lower than those of most of the other countries on a per capita basis or as a \nproportion of gross domestic product.3 \n                                                \n1  The G-20 Seoul Summit Leaders\u2019 Declaration. 11\u201312 November 2010. \nhttp://www.g20.org/Documents2010/11/seoulsummit_declaration.pdf \n2  International Energy Agency, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development, World Bank. 2010.

World Energy Outlook 2010. Paris. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The need for large quantities of energy in rapidly growing economies was evident in the \ninternational energy market in mid-2008, when oil prices reached over $140 per barrel. Though \nthe markets responded to increased energy demand, the high price also tilted the balance of \neconomic power in favor of energy-rich countries. This effect was exacerbated when, after \ndeclining substantially, oil prices once again crossed the $100 per barrel mark in January 2011.  \n \n6.  With rising energy prices in recent past, low-income countries have been confronted with \na  strong  and  consistent  increase  in  the fiscal  cost  of  energy  subsidies,  undermining  their \ndevelopment efforts. Subsidizing fossil-fuel consumption leads to increased demand for the \nhighly scarce energy source. Higher domestic demand puts pressure on energy imports for \nimporting countries or lowers export of energy products in exporting countries, which worsens \nthe trade balance. Subsidies to fossil-fuel producers also create excessive supply, which may \nlead to an early depletion of reserves that in some countries represent the main or only source \nof foreign exchange earnings. This implicit incentive to fossil-fuels has created a disincentive for \nthe development and rapid deployment of renewable energy and therefore, stunted the pursuit \nof countries for low-carbon growth.  \n \n7.  The avowed objective of fossil-fuel consumption subsidies is to redistribute income to \nthe poor. This, however, was debunked by an International Monetary Fund study cited in the \nWorld Energy Outlook 2010, which estimated that \u201580% of the total benefits from petroleum \nsubsidies in 2009 accrued to the richest 40% of households\u2016 because the rich consume more \nenergy than the poor (footnote 3). As a proportion of income, however, fossil-fuel subsidies \ncould be substantial and elimination of such subsidies would still have adverse impact on the \npoor. \n \n8.  Production and consumption subsidies are the more common and explicit forms of fossil-\nfuel subsidies. There are, however, myriad other forms that are less obvious or not easily \ncaptured,  both  in  form  and  the  mechanisms  through  which  they  are  transmitted.  Energy \nsubsidies play a critical role in the economic and social development of a country. Designed and \nimplemented well, subsidies can help achieve more efficient outcomes. The contextual analysis \nof the reform of inefficient energy subsidies will help policy makers design energy subsidies in \nan environmentally, socially, and economically sound manner. The challenge is to come up with \nways and means to meet the needs of a country and its people for affordable modern energy \nservices while tackling climate change and other environmental issues. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will develop a theoretical and empirical framework to define and measure fossil-\nfuel subsidies and assess the socioeconomic impact of the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies in \nselected ADB developing member countries (DMCs) from the World Energy Outlook 2010 list of \ncountries with high fossil-fuel subsidies. These are Bangladesh, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Uzbekistan. The TA may also \ninclude other large energy-consuming countries like the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam. The TA findings are expected to provide a benchmark for future detailed, country-\nspecific studies. The study will have two components. \n \n10.  The first component will constitute a discussion and clarification of suitable definitions of \nfossil-fuel subsidy and its estimation across selected DMCs. Both consumer and producer \nsubsidies will be considered to the extent that relevant data are available. Where the definition \nof subsidies (including indirect subsidies such as cross-subsidies) entails problematic issues or \n ", "  3 \nif data are inaccessible, estimates of subsidies from other sources may be used. The findings \nwill inform about the types of subsidies being implemented, mechanisms (some implicit) through \nwhich they are given, and the economic sectors that are benefiting. The coverage is expected to \naccount for a major fraction of the fossil-fuel subsidies in all ADB DMCs. \n \n11.  The second component will evaluate household-specific impacts from the elimination of \nsubsidies and the consequent short- and medium-term rise in energy prices, and discuss the \ndesign of social safety nets to mitigate these impacts on the poor, considering gender equity. In \ndefining  social  safety-net  mechanisms,  contextual  variations  (e.g.,  institutional  and  political \nenvironments) of countries will be taken into account. The study will make use of existing data \nfrom household surveys and, where necessary, may include small surveys with qualitative \nassessment to reveal the household impacts. The benefit-incidence analysis of households will \nbe used to determine the need for developing social safety-net mechanisms to protect the poor \nagainst a likely rise in energy prices as the subsidies are eliminated. \n   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be more efficient use of energy, less environmental pollution, and better \nsafety nets to protect the poor.  \n \n13.  The outcome will be that target DMCs will have a better understanding of fossil-fuel \nsubsidies and the implications of phasing it out for poor households.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA activities will include the development of conceptual frameworks for the two \ncomponents  of  the  study,  gathering  of  data,  in-country  surveys  if  necessary,  hiring  of \nconsultants,  meetings  and  workshops  involving  internal  and  external  stakeholders,  and \ndissemination seminars. \n \n15.  The main TA output will be the completed study to focus renewed attention of DMCs on \nthe detrimental impact of rising fossil-energy use on climate change, the issues of subsidies on \nfossil fuel that undermine the pursuit of sustainable development, and social protection for the \npoor.  \n \n16.  Data  will  largely  be  collected  from  secondary  sources  to  the  extent  available  and \napplicable. If required, more detailed data will be gathered from the representative DMCs to get \nthe characteristics of local markets, economic structure, industrial composition, types of energy \nsubsidies, household characteristics, and other information, as necessary. Rigorous analytical \nmethods, econometric techniques, and other modeling approaches will be used in the analysis, \nincluding developing some scenario analyses. \n \n17.  Workshops,  country  seminars,  and  conferences  will  be  organized  to  consult  with \ngovernments and other stakeholders and to disseminate the findings of the research study. The \ninception workshop, to which high-caliber resource persons and economists will be invited, will \nrefine the research problems to be tackled, the analytical framework to be used, and the study \nmethodology to be applied. Representatives from the government, the private sector, academe, \nand multilateral organizations will be invited to country seminars and conferences to exchange \nideas, take stock of lessons from the TA, examine its contributions, and chart the way forward.   \n \n ", "4   \n18.  Analytical papers produced under the TA will be published in different formats such as \nworking papers, policy notes, briefs, and journal articles. The final TA findings will be published \nin a form that could be used as a framework by DMCs in reforming their energy sectors and \ninstituting mechanisms to protect the poor from the resulting economic changes. The output will \nnot be designed as a policy prescription but as a guidepost to policy making. To this end, an \nemphasis will be placed on the qualitative and quantitative impacts of subsidies on different \nparts of the economy rather than on the size of the estimated subsidy. \n \n19.  Several DMCs that are members of the G-20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation4 \nwill concurrently examine the fossil-fuel subsidy issues under the action plans of the respective \norganizations. The ADB study team will coordinate with the experts concerned to build synergy \nand  complementarities  in  the  research  and  policy  recommendations.  The  selection  and \nparticipation of DMCs will be sought after the inception workshop, i.e., when governments have \nclarity regarding the scope and design of the study. \n \n20.  The team will also need to manage expectations\u2014the scope is extensive given the \ndifferent types of fossil-fuel subsidies, and because nearly all sectors are affected by pricing \ndecisions  in  the  economies  to  be  analyzed.  A  suitable  analytical  framework  needs  to  be \ndeveloped to bring together the two components\u2014quantifying fossil-fuel subsidy and mitigating \nhousehold impacts for the poor. It will be difficult in this initial study to define all the policy \noptions linked to phasing out energy subsidies in Asia and the Pacific; however, the intent would \nbe  to  analyze  several  representative  economies  (e.g., exporting  or  importing,  with  mainly \nindustrial  or  household  energy  consumption,  or  with  market-based  or  administered  pricing \nmechanisms). Owing to the limitations, the DMCs would not be expected to directly act on the \nconclusions  of  the  study.  Follow-on  country  studies  would  be  necessary  to  (i) assess  the \nimpacts of removing fossil-fuel subsidies on broad macroeconomic indicators such as fiscal \nbalance, trade balance, industrial structure and employment; and (ii) develop relevant action \nplans, including an effective communications program, for phasing out fossil-fuel subsidy as \nappropriate social protection measures are established. \n \n21.  The aim is to complete the preliminary draft of the first component of the study around \nJanuary 2012, with the final draft by February 2012, and the first draft of the second component \nby March 2012, with the final draft by April 2012. Although an initial publication of the integrative \nreport of the study  is expected to be available October 2012, the final publication will be \nreleased in January 2013.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The financing will \ncover  remuneration  and  travel  expenses  of  international  and  national  consultants;  survey, \nconsultations  and  workshops;  reports  and  communications;  and  contingency.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  the  implementing \nagencies will be the Regional and Sustainable Development Department and the Economics \n                                                \n4  These DMCs are the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; \nMalaysia; Papua New Guinea; the Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n ", "  5 \nand Research Department. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). An ADB-\nwide  study  team  has  been  established  with  nominations  from  various  departments.  More \nnominations, including international and national staff in the respective resident missions, may \nbe sought from the regional departments once the DMCs are determined. A steering committee \n(comprising the directors general of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nand  one  regional  department,  and  the  chief  economist  of  the  Economics  and  Research \nDepartment) will provide direction to the team and give the final sign-off on the TA outputs. The \nTA will commence in August 2011 and be completed by January 2013. No-objection will be \nobtained from governments of relevant countries prior to implementing any planned activity. \n \n24.  The TA will require the services of nine international consultants (total of 27 person-\nmonths) and 12 national consultants (total of 54 person-months). The consulting team will \ncomprise (i) an international energy economist (lead consultant), (ii) an international public \nfinance and energy specialist, (iii) 6 international resource persons, (iv) an international copy \neditor, (v) 10 national economists, (vi) a national logistics coordinator,  and (vii) a national \nresearch  analyst.  The  logistics  coordinator  will  manage  day-to-day  communications  and \nlogistics among all stakeholders and keep track of implementation. The research analyst will \nsupport the development of a complete database on all the information collected during TA \nimplementation to generate longer-term benefits from the TA for ADB and the DMCs. ADB will \nrecruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). A consulting firm will be selected to provide specialists (i), (ii), and \n(v) according to quality- and cost-based selection procedures. As the contract budgets for this \ncomponent are less than $1,000,000, simplified technical proposals will be requested from \nshort-listed  firms.  The  standard  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20  will  be  applied.  The  remaining \nconsultants will be recruited as individual consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Assessment and Implications of Rationalizing and Phasing Out Fossil-Fuel Subsidies, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nE.
