INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nStrengthening Capacity in the Implementation of the Green Financing Platform for the Greater \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region. The TA is not included in the country operations business plan. \nDuring  the  fact-finding  mission  in  November  2016,  an  agreement  was  reached  with  the \ngovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, terms of reference for consultants, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region is one of the most important economic \nregions in the PRC,2 generating more than a third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.3 But \nthis region also consistently experiences poor air quality because it largely relies on energy-\nintensive enterprises, coal-based power generation, and a large number of diesel and gasoline-\nfueled automobiles. The government is striving to improve the air quality and has issued stricter \nenvironmental regulations and a target to reduce the average concentration of most hazardous \nair-polluting fine particulate matter. As enterprises modernize and upgrade their production \nfacilities to meet stricter environmental regulations and reduce emissions, they must make \ncapital expenditures that may not lead to additional revenue. New business models for such \ninvestments are needed, which require deep understanding of technical and financial issues \nassociated with diverse sets of enterprises. Moreover, reducing the region\u2019s use of coal requires \nrapid low-carbon (such as natural gas) and renewable energy development, which is capital \nintensive.4 The region needs the right policies and tighter regulations to spur demand, state-of-\nthe-art technologies, and tailored financial instruments and financing. More importantly, the \nregion needs an extensive outreach program to stimulate behavioral changes. \n \n3.  In 2013, the State Council issued the Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air \nPollution, 2013\u20132017.5 To support the government\u2019s effort for air pollution reduction by building \na comprehensive policy framework and promoting coordinated actions and investments, ADB \napproved the first policy-based loan in Hebei.6 Given the challenges to improve the air quality in \nthe BTH region, ADB and the government have agreed in principle on a multiyear lending \nsupport program through $2.5 billion in project loans spread over 2016\u20132020. In 2016, ADB is \nprocessing a loan for Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region \nunder  the  Green  Financing  Platform  Project  of  China  National  Investment  and  Guaranty \nCorporation (I&G), which will set up a dedicated green financing platform (GFP) for the BTH \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 November 2016. \n2  The greater BTH region includes Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Liaoning \nprovinces; and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n3  While the core BTH region of Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei Province accounts for nearly 10% of the \nPRC\u2019s gross domestic product, the greater BTH region accounts for more than 34% of national gross domestic \nproduct (CNY22 trillion in 2014).  \n4  Based on a report prepared by the Clean Air Alliance of China, the implementation of the Comprehensive Action \nPlan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control for the core BTH region will need direct investment of $37.8 billion. \nHowever, the dedicated financial support from the central government was only $0.76 billion  in 2013 and \n$1.52 billion in 2014. \n5  Government of the PRC. 2013. Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, 2013\u20132017. Beijing. \n6  ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nHebei Air Quality Improvement\u2013Hebei Policy Reforms Program. Manila. The policy-based loan was fully disbursed \nin June 2016 and all policy actions under the loan have been implemented.    \n ", "2   \nregion that (i) will serve diverse needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large \nenterprises across agriculture, energy, transport, and urban sectors; (ii) has seamless reach \nacross the BTH region; and (iii) has the appropriate suite of lending instruments to support a \nlarge number of modest but scattered investments. The proposed GFP will be an open platform \nin which commercial banks, other development partners, and agencies can participate. Given \nthe lack of capacity to appraise green investments, the participation of commercial banks and \nfinancial institutions in financing green investments, especially those by SMEs, is limited. The \nproposed loan targets SMEs, the economic actors with the most financing needs, in polluting \nindustries. The financial intermediation loan modality will be adopted for this proposed loan. The \ncombination of this modality and the regional approach will help determine viable projects in an \neconomically and environmentally critical region of the PRC.  \n \n4.  However, such an approach over a wide region and across all key sectors involves risks \nsuch as (i) failure to combine suitable technical and safeguard expertise over a broad range of \nprojects to appraise them appropriately; (ii) weak arrangements for connecting potential end \nusers  to  the  platform  in  an  efficient  way,  undermining  demand  from  the  platform;  and \n(iii) inadequate monitoring and verification arrangements to evaluate the environmental and \nenergy-efficient performance of a large number of projects. In view of these potential risks, the \ngovernment  requested  ADB  to  strengthen  capacity  so  that  these  risks  can  be  sufficiently \nmitigated and the effectiveness of the GFP will be enhanced. The TA is particularly designed to \nstrengthen the implementation of the GFP, mitigate the demand-side risks, and ensure the best \nimpact of the proposed loan. The TA aims to (i) improve the reach of the GFP to potential \nborrowers;  (ii)  increase  readiness  of  the  subprojects,  especially  those  involving  advanced \ntechnology;  (iii)  design  and  develop  an  online  application  and  data  collection  platform  for \npotential  subprojects;  and  (iv)  improve  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies, participating banks and financial institutions, and subborrowers. \n \n5.  The TA is well aligned with the priority of the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020, to \nmanage climate change and the environment to help the government achieve an ecological \ncivilization.7 The TA is also fully aligned with the government\u2019s Comprehensive Action Plan for \nAir Pollution Prevention and Control and the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for clean and low-carbon \ndevelopment in the BTH region, and fills a critical gap. It will directly help realize the 13th plan's \ngoal of improving air quality.8  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The proposed TA will help improve the capacity of I&G and other financial institutions in \nenergy  management,  emission  monitoring  and  verification,  establishment  of  energy \nconsumption  baselines,  verification  of  energy  savings,  compliance  with  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards, project appraisal in economic terms, and project development in the BTH \nregion. It will also build ADB\u2019s practical knowledge in the emerging area of green development \nfinancing and will assist other developing member countries.  \n \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Transforming Partnership: People\u2019s Republic of China and Asian \nDevelopment Bank, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n8  Government of the PRC. 2016. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. The 13th plan requires cities to \nmeet \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d standards 80% of the time (meaning they must score below 100 on China\u2019s Air Quality \nIndex of 0\u2013500). The 80% target is additional to a target to reduce by 25% the number of polluted days, and to \nreduce by 18% the number of days when fine particulate matter exceeds allowable limits. \n ", "  3 \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be that GFP-based air quality improvements in the BTH region are \naccelerated. The outcome will be sustainably expanded use of the GFP by all key sectors and \nsegments.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: \n(i)    online application and data collection platform for the developers of potential \nsubprojects implemented to improve the reach of the GFP to potential borrowers;  \n(ii)    readiness of the subprojects increased through better knowledge dissemination \nand information sharing; and  \n(iii)   subproject developers\u2019 capacity in preparing bankable projects strengthened to \nassess and appraise subprojects meeting ADB and national requirements, and \nverification and reporting on environmental performance of subprojects. \n \n9.  Key activities under the TA are: \n(i)  develop and build an online application and data collection platform that will allow \nthe GFP to become a one-stop, user-friendly knowledge and investment platform;  \n(ii)  strengthen the institutional capacity of relevant agencies and entities, including \nthe  executing  agency,  other  financial  institutions,  and  project  developer  and \nowners;  \n(iii)  organize knowledge sharing and information dissemination through workshops \nand conferences;  \n(iv)  improve subprojects\u2019 readiness, especially those using advanced technologies; \nand  \n(v)  publish  knowledge  products  and  provide  services  to  developing  member \ncountries on green financing, low-carbon technologies, and business models. \n \n10.  Major risks are that (i) the economic slowdown curbs the appetite for green investments, \n(ii) weak demand from subborrowers may slow implementation, and (iii) the capacity of the GFP \nto reach out and appraise subprojects is weak and undermines results. To mitigate those risks, \ncapacity development training and workshops in project management and implementation will \nbe organized, and close coordination and monitoring between ADB and the executing agency \nwill be established.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Clean Energy Fund9 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, information and support needed for the \nTA, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimate and financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  I&G will be the executing and implementing agency. The TA will be implemented over \n36 months, from 1 December 2016 to 30 November 2019. The TA will place experts with \n                                                \n9  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n ", "4   \ntechnical and safeguard expertise to supplement I&G\u2019s capacity and guide the appraisal of first \nbatch of subprojects financed under the GFP, which will help I&G better understand practical \nimplementation of ADB's safeguard requirements and strengthen their capacity. The TA will \nrequire 10 person-months of inputs from international consultants in technology selection and \nenvironmental  assessments,  and  39  person-months  of  inputs  from  national  consultants  to \nprovide technical support in energy efficiency, renewable energy, agricultural waste utilization, \nenvironmental  assessment,  energy  performance  monitoring  and  verification,  and  how  to \nmanage foreign exchange risks for I&G. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n13.  The innovative nature of the GFP calls for highly qualified and specialized technical \nexperts with knowledge and experience relevant to the subprojects to be financed.  These \nconsultants will be recruited individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Lump-sum payments and output-based \ncontracts will be considered under the TA where applicable. Disbursements under the TA will be \nin accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n14.  The  online  application  and  data  collection  platform  is  a  key  component  of  the  TA \ndeliverables. However, its details will not be finalized until the early stage of TA implementation, \nin extensive consultation with the executing agency and ADB, whereupon a suitable agency will \nbe selected to design, manage, and implement it before 30 November 2019. The selection of \nthe IT agency will be subject to ADB approval. I&G staff will be trained on how to maintain the \nplatform, which will be owned and managed by I&G after closure of the TA.  \n \n15.  The TA can benefit from the ongoing capacity development TA for support of ADB\u2013\nUnited  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  Cooperation  (USEPA),  which  includes  an \nindicative activity relating to air quality management for the BTH region in the PRC. 10 The \nUSEPA experts can contribute to the proposed capacity development TA through their ongoing \nTA.  The  Environment  and  Safeguards  Division  of  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate \nChange Department will provide necessary support for cooperation with USEPA.   \n \n16.  The TA will be monitored through the consultants\u2019 progress reports and ADB review \nmissions.  During  the  missions,  discussions  will  be  held  to  review  the  performance  of  the \nconsultants, TA implementation progress, and the completion of deliverables based on the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  and  on  an  agreed  work  plan  for  the  consultants.  The \ndeliverables submitted by the consultants will be reviewed by the executing and implementing \nagency as well as ADB. The performance of the TA, including its outputs and outcomes, will be \nevaluated during the final review mission. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for Strengthening Capacity \nin the Implementation of the Green Financing Platform for the Greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei \nRegion, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2015.
