INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) efforts to measure, monitor, and manage for \ndevelopment results include conducting impact evaluations. Impact evaluation may be defined \nas  an  assessment  of  changes  in  the  well-being  of  individuals  that  can  be  attributed  to a \nparticular project, program, or policy. Thus, the central question of an impact evaluation is what \nwould  have  happened  to  those  receiving  the  intervention  had  they  not  received  it. \nMainstreaming impact evaluation in ADB operations helps improve the quality of development \npolicy and design of projects, eventually leading to improved development effectiveness for \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). It assists ADB and DMCs to allocate limited resources \nmore efficiently, guide the design of more effective interventions, and enhance evidence-based \npolicy dialogue. The impact evaluation initiative was piloted in ADB through a research and \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) in 2010.1 The concept paper for the proposed cluster \nregional  research  and  development  TA  was  approved  by  the  vice-president  (knowledge \nmanagement and sustainable development) on 28 August 2012. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Bilateral and multilateral development agencies spend more than $30 billion each year \non  social  development  programs,  with  developing  countries  spending  another  $300  billion \nannually. However, the development effectiveness of this spending is not always clear and \nevidence on its impact is often scant. In particular, it is not known how much of Asia\u2019s recent \nimprovement in poverty reduction and human capital outcomes has been due to development \nspending and how much is a trickle-down effect of the region\u2019s rapid economic growth. This lack \nof information limits the ability of policy makers and development partners to further improve \neffectiveness of the development spending through proper design of programs, projects, and \nother interventions. \n \n3.  ADB's economic sector work, cost\u2013benefit analysis, as well as design and monitoring \nframeworks, collect information that provides a basis for identifying project performance both in \nadvance (ex ante) and after completion (ex post). The ex ante analysis is useful for designing \nprojects  and monitoring  performance.  After  project  completion, the Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment (IED) validates project performance rating reported in the project completion report \n(PCR). The final ratings assigned form the basis for the success rates. The PCR lessons are \nalso reviewed and updated in IED's validation reports. In selected cases, IED also conducts \nproject performance evaluation of projects, usually at least after 2 to 3 years with additional \nfocus on project impacts and their sustainability. However, the ex-post assessment of the causal \nlinks between inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impact is often limited by the lack of reliable, \ncarefully  constructed  counterfactuals  and  baseline  surveys,  thus,  limiting  accountability  for \ndevelopment outcomes. These counterfactuals and baseline surveys are best started early in \nthe project cycle as part of project monitoring and evaluation system. An early start allows for \nmainstreaming and systematic assessments of impacts and development effectiveness at mid-\nterm and project completion. Impact evaluation should also be built into the project design rather \nthan conceptualized after approval, wherever feasible. Impact evaluations should ideally be \ndone by regional departments to ensure ownership of the process and outcome. \n \n4.  ADB recognized the need to more systematically measure outcomes and impact to \nensure the development effectiveness of its programs and projects. The TA for Implementing \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2010. Implementing Impact Evaluation at ADB. Manila (TA 7680-REG). \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 August 2012. \n ", "2   \nImpact Evaluation at ADB supported the initiation of five impact evaluation studies\u2014in Georgia, \nMongolia, Nepal, Viet Nam, and the Pacific region (covering Papua New Guinea, Solomon \nIslands, and Timor-Leste)\u2014and impact evaluation training programs and awareness building \nevents for staff, providing a key step toward mainstreaming impact evaluation in ADB operations. \nHowever,  increasing  and  mainstreaming  impact  evaluation  into  ADB  operations  requires \ncontinuation and expansion of impact evaluation initiatives over an extended period of time. \nAdditional resources will be required to (i) initiate an increasing number of comprehensive \nawareness  raising  and  capacity  building  activities  in  DMCs;  (ii)  undertake  methodological \nresearch to adopt available tools and techniques to sector- and theme-specific needs; and, (iii) \nprovide \u2015seed\u2016 funds to expand the conduct of impact evaluation studies in ADB operations. The \nproposed TA is expected to address these needs. \n \n5.  Impact evaluations at ADB have so far been largely carried out through the individual \nefforts of regional departments and, recently, through the ADB wide TA for Implementing Impact \nEvaluation at ADB. Under the TA for Implementing Impact Evaluation at ADB, although the \nregional departments are responsible for the final outputs of the impact evaluation studies and \ntheir quality, the dissemination of the results of the impact evaluations has been limited. The \nreports, data and other information are also stored in the respective regional department, with \nlittle scope for cross-referencing or exchange of knowledge. Therefore, there is  a need to \nexpand the role of the Economics and Research Department (ERD) from coordination to also \ninclude (i) establishing a repository for impact evaluations, with accessibility for staff of ADB and \nDMCs; (ii) facilitating the exchange of knowledge (experience and lessons) among ADB staff \nand DMCs; and, (iii) providing technical support to regional departments on the design and \nimplementation of impact evaluation studies and their preparation and finalization. \n \n6.  An important lesson learned from the TA for Implementing Impact Evaluation at ADB is \nthat time frames for impact evaluation studies are typically long, and hence the commitment to \nindividual studies needs to match the implementation period of the projects. Moreover, impacts \nof projects can occur during, immediately after, or even long after project implementation. For \nexample, some education or health interventions can have measurable impacts during project \nimplementation, impacts of transport or energy projects will only occur after completion, while \nprojects aimed at improving access to markets or environment may take years to demonstrate \nan impact. Cluster TA modality, given the option that individual studies can be covered through \nmultiple subprojects, serves as the appropriate modality as the longer term engagement does \nnot require tying down the entire resource requirements at onset of the TA. Cluster modality will \nalso allow for TA to be more responsive to the emerging needs and demands of the DMCs, \nwhile reducing costs otherwise devoted for processing individual studies as standalone TAs. \n \n7.  Another lesson from the TA for Implementing Impact Evaluation at ADB is that the \ndesign of the baseline study is crucial to the success of evaluation. If the baseline study is \nweakly designed or implemented, it will be very difficult to make the necessary changes later \nand the resulting evaluation will be unreliable. Careful planning and technical support early on in \nthe  impact  evaluation  study  is  important  to  ensure  high-quality  outputs.  Front-end  support \nshould include systematic training and capacity building for ADB staff and DMC officials who will \nbe involved in conducting impact evaluation studies\u2014training that will cover all aspects of \nimpact evaluation, including formulating proper research questions, designing study instruments, \nfieldwork, and data analysis. Technical support should also include direct technical advice in the \nappropriate  design  of  impact  evaluation  methodologies  and  survey  instruments,  and  their \napplication on the ground. A corollary lesson is that technical advice is best provided with direct \nknowledge of the conditions on the ground. Technical staff and external experts need to visit \nproject sites and survey areas in order to give proper technical advice. \n ", "  3 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  envisaged  impact  of  the  TA  is  improved  development  effectiveness  of  ADB-\ndesigned projects responsive to the development needs of DMCs. The envisaged outcome of \nthe TA is that impact evaluation is mainstreamed3 in ADB operations through each subproject \nresulting in well-designed and -monitored ADB projects in DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n9.  The  TA  will  comprise  three  subprojects,  with  each  subproject  covering  5  impact \nevaluation studies, for a total of 15 studies distributed over the five ADB regional departments. \n \n2.  Subproject 1 \n \n10.  Subproject 1 will comprise two main components: (i) the conduct of 5 impact evaluation \nstudies applying various methodologies and survey instruments; and (ii) the development of \nimpact evaluation methodologies, approaches, and capacities in both ADB and its DMCs.\n \n \n11.  Component 1: Conduct of impact evaluation studies. This component will support \nthe conduct of a number of impact evaluation studies while ensuring that at least one study is \nsupported in each of the five regions (Central and West Asia, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia, \nand Southeast Asia). On average, $200,000 will be allocated to each region for conduct of \nimpact evaluation studies under the subproject.  Activities under the individual studies may \ninclude designing the study methodology and survey instruments; conducting baseline, mid-line, \nand end-line surveys; and producing the study reports. The TA will endeavor to support the \nconduct of full impact evaluation studies from beginning to end within the time frame of the TA. \nHowever, as learned from the experience of the TA for Implementing Impact Evaluation at ADB, \nthe TA may support key phases of individual studies; for example, to be approved by the Impact \nEvaluation  Committee (IEC),  only  the  design and  conduct  of the  baseline  survey  may  be \nimplemented under the TA, while the mid-line and end-line surveys can be financed through \nseparate initiatives.4 Through this component, the TA will provide direct technical support by \nindividual and firm consultants and ERD specialists to individual studies by advising on design, \nmethodology, and application in all phases of the study.  \n \n12.  Component 2: Development of impact evaluation methodologies, approaches, and \ncapacities. The second component will entail a number of activities, including (i) reviewing \nimpact evaluation methodologies and improvements in techniques and tools for sector- and \ntheme-specific studies; (ii) conducting pilot studies to test sector- or theme-specific techniques \nand tools; (iii) conducting impact evaluation awareness raising and capacity building for DMC \nofficials and ADB staff; (iv) establishing and maintaining a central impact evaluation data portal \ncontaining information on project baseline, mid-line, and end-line surveys (e.g., questionnaires, \nsampling methodology, interviewer manuals, field data); and (v) conducting knowledge-sharing \n                                                \n3  Impact evaluation is mainstreamed in ADB operations when it is integrated in the process of designing projects in \nDMCs based on gained experiences from actual conduct of impact evaluation studies adopting appropriate \nmethodology, knowledge-sharing workshops and conferences, and capacity building activities.  \n4  If only the study design or baseline survey can be implemented under the TA, the IEC may require commitment \nfrom regional departments concerned to have mid-line and/or end-line surveys and/or studies undertaken in the \nfuture. \n ", "4   \nactivities  (i.e.,  regional  conferences  where  impact  evaluation  studies  conducted  will  be \npresented;  and  workshops  and  seminars  where  experts  will  be  invited  to  share  methods, \npractices,  and  lessons  on  impact  evaluation)  and  publishing  and  disseminating  impact \nevaluation studies (publishing impact evaluation studies for distribution to ADB and government \ncounterparts, and uploading studies to the ADB website). \n \n3.  Subsequent Subprojects (Subprojects 2 and 3) \n \n13.  The subsequent subprojects will also be structured along the lines of the components \ndescribed in subproject 1. Subprojects 2-3 will also have two components: (i) impact evaluation \nstudies, and (ii) development of impact evaluation methodologies, approaches, and capacities. \nThe design of subprojects 2-3 is envisaged benefitting from the lessons from implementing \nsubproject 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Each subproject is estimated to cost \n$1,500,000. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  overall  executing  agency for the TA,  which  will  commence  on  31 \nJanuary 2013 and will be completed on 31 March 2017. An IEC will be established, comprising \nrepresentatives (one principal and the alternate)5 from ADB\u2019s regional departments, ERD, the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department, and Central Operations Services Office, \nand will be chaired by one of the regional department representatives. The IEC will provide \noverall  guidance  and  oversight  for  the  TA,  including  allocation  of  resources  under  each \ncomponent. The IED will be invited as an observer. For component 1, the regional departments \nwill propose and, if approved by the IEC, implement impact evaluation studies.6  The IEC \napproval will require commitment from regional departments to have mid-line and/or end-line \nsurveys/studies  undertaken  in  case  only  the  study  design  or  baseline  survey  can  be \nimplemented under the proposed C-RDTA. The regional departments will be responsible for the \nfinal outputs of the impact evaluation studies, including reports, and for the quality of their \nrespective studies. ERD will provide support to regional departments on the technical design \nand implementation of impact evaluation studies, and in the preparation and finalization of \nimpact evaluation studies and reports. Results of impact evaluation studies will be published as \npart of project completion reports or as stand-alone working papers. The collection of data sets \nwill be supervised by the impact evaluation study team members and staff assigned by the IEC \nto ensure their quality. ERD will propose, and if approved by the IEC, implement activities that \nfall under component 2 of the TA in collaboration with regional departments.7 \n \n16.  Each  of  the  impact  evaluation  studies  will  require  a  team  of  consultants,  both \ninternational and national, to be engaged separately. The consultants will (i) provide technical \nguidance  and  feedback  on  the  evaluation  studies,  (ii)  develop  the  design  of  the  impact \nevaluation  studies  together  with  the  ADB  team,  (iii)  assist  in  guiding  and  overseeing  the \n                                                \n5  Alternate representatives will also be nominated to represent principal representatives in case the principal \nrepresentatives are not available for a meeting. \n6  No-objection will be sought from the respective governments of DMCs to be covered under this TA prior to \ncommencing the impact evaluation studies. \n7  Proposals from regional departments, the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, and the Central \nOperations Services Office are also welcome under component 2. If approved by the IEC, the activities shall be \njointly implemented by the initiator and ERD. \n ", "  5 \nimplementation of impact evaluation studies, (iv) assist in survey designs, (v) implement the \nsurveys, and (vi) assist in data analysis and report evaluation. Cost estimates for consulting \nservices will be prepared in consultation with the divisions implementing the individual impact \nevaluation studies. Consultant packages for each impact evaluation study will comprise both \nfirms and individuals, as appropriate. About 21 person-months of international and 45 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  implement  the  TA  components. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  Procurement  of  equipment  (computer  hardware  and  software)  by  ADB  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement will take place in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and \nTechnology and Office of Administrative Services. When the TA is completed, any procured \nequipment will remain ADB property and/or will be disposed of in accordance with relevant ADB \nguidelines. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will involve partnership with recognized impact evaluation research institutes and \nglobal  centers  of  excellence,  such  as  the  International  Initiative  for  Impact  Evaluation, \nInnovations for Poverty Action, or the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab. Such partnerships \nwill largely be in terms of exchange of knowledge and participation of resource persons in \ntraining and consultation workshops. The TA will shoulder the incremental cost for resource \npersons if necessary. \n \n19.  ERD  will  report  on  the  progress  of  the  TA  and  the  individual  studies  through  the \nestablished  project  performance  management  systems  in  coordination  with  the  regional \ndepartments and other concerned departments. A number of reports on the individual studies \nwill  also  be  produced  under  the  TA,  and  these  will  be  disseminated  through  seminars, \nworkshops, or conferences. A consolidated TA completion report will be prepared for the TA. No \nseparate TA completion reports need to be prepared for the subprojects. For preparation of the \nconsolidated  completion  report,  each  impact  evaluation  study  team  will  provide  complete \ninformation to the TA project officer. Further details on implementation arrangements are in the \nsupplementary appendix (available on request). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $4,500,000 on a grant basis for Developing Impact Evaluation \nMethodologies, Approaches, and Capacities in Selected Developing Member Countries. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \n  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  Increased number of  Project completion  DMC governments have \ndevelopment  completed ADB- reports  adequate support and are \neffectiveness of  financed projects rated    open to incorporating impact \nADB-designed  effective in achieving  Evaluation reports and  evaluation studies in the \nprojects responsive  outcome from 69%  other operational  design of loans and grants. \nto the development  (average of 2009\u2013 documents   \nneeds of DMCs  2011) to 75% by 2020,  Risk \nbased on ADB\u2019s  Project designs may involve \nmeasure of  additional cost from \ndevelopment  incorporating impact \neffectiveness  evaluation, which may \ndiscourage DMCs. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImpact evaluation is  By 2017, at least 15  Reports and  There is adequate support \nmainstreamed in  new projects in ADB  recommendations of  from ADB Management and \nADB operations   incorporate impact  the President  DMC governments to conduct \nevaluation in project    impact evaluation studies on \ndesign with increased  Reports to IEC  projects. \nDMC involvement     \n(2012 baseline: five in  TA performance  For sustained implementation, \n2012 [outputs from the  reports  succeeding impact evaluation \nTA for Implementing    studies will continue to be \nImpact Evaluation at  TA completion reports  financed through other and/or \nADB])a    succeeding TA projects and \nProject completion  lending operations. \nreports   \n  Staff in regional departments \nOther operational  are willing and committed to \ndocuments  incorporating impact evaluation \n  in the design of their projects. \nBack-to-office reports   \nRisks \nInitially, staff may have \ndifficulty in incorporating \nimpact evaluation in project \ndesigns, which may impact on \nfull acceptance of impact \nevaluation. \nThere is always cost \nassociated with incorporating \nimpact evaluation in project \ndesigns.
