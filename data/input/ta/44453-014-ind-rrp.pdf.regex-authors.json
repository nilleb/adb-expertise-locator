I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to India for the West Bengal Development Finance Program. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  West  Bengal  Development \nFinance Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program seeks to facilitate implementation of a comprehensive fiscal \nconsolidation program in West Bengal. This will generate fiscal savings and thereby assist West \nBengal to augment and sustain growth-enhancing development financing.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  West Bengal is a densely populated state, the fourth largest in India, with a population of \nover 91 million people and strategically located in eastern India bordering Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nand Nepal. West Bengal is characterized by a fair degree of vertical imbalance: the state's large \nexpenditure  assignments\u2014mostly  concentrated  in  primary  and  secondary  education,  and \nhealth\u2014contrast with a generally low level of state revenues, and the gap is covered by central \ngovernment transfers and borrowings. \n \n4.  Despite many achievements in the recent past, the deteriorating fiscal situation in West \nBengal has put more pressure on public resources, constraining the delivery of public goods \nand services in the state. In an attempt to contain fiscal deficits, state authorities have often \nsacrificed development financing, undermining fixed capital asset formation and gross domestic \nproduct growth. The disregard for maintaining sound and sustainable public finances led to the \nhighest deficit figures in fiscal year (FY) 2010 among all the states in India\u2014West Bengal's \nrevenue deficit amounted to 3.7% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) and the fiscal deficit \nto 4.1% of GSDP. Similarly, own-tax revenue at 4.5% of GSDP in FY2010 clearly reveals the \nlowest tax efforts among all the states in India.3 The committed expenditures of the government \n(on salaries, pensions, and interest payments) alone have almost exhausted the total revenue \nreceipts  of  the  state  in  recent  years,  requiring  even  larger  borrowings  to  finance  these \nexpenditures,  thereby  trapping  the  state  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  mounting  current  account \n(revenue) and fiscal deficits. The inability to rein in the fiscal deficits gradually pushed up public \ndebt, which was 40% of GSDP in FY2010, the highest in the country among the general \ncategory states (Table 1).4 \n \n5.  The weakening fiscal situation of the Government of West Bengal (GOWB) has had \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA), which was approved \nby the director general of the South Asia Department on 17 December 2011 for an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $220,000 as a subproject under the cluster TA (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance Cluster to India for \nAdvanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila (C-TA 0003-IND, financed by the Government of \nthe United Kingdom through the Department for International Development). \n3  A recent comparison of tax administration efficiency in FY2010 shows that collection costs for sales tax (value-\nadded tax [VAT]) and state excise tax are higher in West Bengal than in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, \nand Tamil Nadu. For instance, collection cost as a percentage of total VAT collected is 1.24% in West Bengal, \n0.82% in Karnataka, and 0.74% in Tamil Nadu. A similar picture emerges for other taxes. \n4  States are divided between general category and special category based on geographic terrain and inherent \ninfrastructure difficulties. ", "2 \nnegative consequences for its development agenda. In particular, the increase in debt and \nresulting debt service payments has reduced fiscal space, limited the ability of GOWB to use \npublic  spending  effectively  to  meet  its  policy  priorities,  and  meant  that  fiscal  adjustment \ndisproportionately  affected  capital  spending  on  economic  and  social  infrastructure.  Indeed, \ncapital outlays in West Bengal have been declining from 1.2% of GSDP in FY1994 to 0.5% in \nFY2010 and are currently the lowest in India (0.7% in FY2011).5 \n \n6.  These developments have not only prevented the effective use of the budget as an \ninstrument  to  set  policy  priorities,  particularly  through  discretionary  spending,  but  more \nimportantly have constrained both public and private investment, thus undermining economic \ngrowth  and  development  in  the  state.  They  have  also  seriously  hamstrung  manufacturing \ngrowth in the state, leading to a narrowing of the commercial tax base. \n \nTable 1: Key Fiscal Indicators across Selected States in India (FY2010) \n(% of gross state domestic product) \nWest  GCS  Andhra \nItem  Bengal  Average  Karnataka  Pradesh  Best Performing \nRevenue deficit  (-)/surplus  (3.7)  (0.5)  0.4  0.1  2.0  \n    (Madhya Pradesh)  \nFiscal deficit (-)/surplus  (4.1)  (3.1)  (2.9)  (2.4)  (2.2) \n(Chhattisgarh) \nPrimary deficit (-)/surplus  (1.2)  (1.2)  (1.5)  (0.6)  0.0 \n(Rajasthan) \nDebt  40.0  n.a.  22.6  24.0  13.2 \n(Chhattisgarh) \n( ) = negative, GCS = general category state, n.a. = not applicable. \nNote: West Bengal is a general category state. Indicators for West Bengal are based on actual data, whereas data for \nthe rest of the states are based on revised estimates. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India report on state finances: A study of state budgets, 2011\u20132012. The estimates for West \nBengal, however, are taken from the finance accounts. Gross state domestic product estimates for West Bengal are as \nper the State Economic Review. \n \n7.  Thus, the logic of the proposed program hinges on the link between creating fiscal space \nas  a  means  to  augment  and  sustain  development  financing  in  the  state  and  laying  the \ngroundwork for improvements in service delivery and development expenditures. While the \ncurrent program is focused on fiscal stabilization, a follow-on program in 2014 will focus on \nusing the fiscal savings generated under the current program to finance greater efficiency in \nservice delivery and improvements in livelihoods. \n \n8.  The program is consistent with the current country partnership strategy and country \noperations business plan for 2012\u20132014 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which states \nthat ADB will continue to provide assistance for fiscal consolidation to reinforce the central \ngovernment\u2019s efforts toward bridging interstate economic disparities and creating conditions for \ninclusive growth.6 \n                                                \n5  \u201cIn the medium to long term, the brunt is eventually borne by either new or maintenance investments in \ninfrastructure, or the delivery of social services\u2014areas where spending levels are more discretionary than the \npayment of salaries, pensions, or interest on past debt. These are precisely the areas in which the role of the \ngovernment in promoting growth and reducing poverty is the greatest.\u201d A. Banerjee et al. 2002.

Manila; ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business \nPlan, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n ", "3 \n9.  The program specifies three areas to support fiscal consolidation and set state finances \non a path consistent with a revised and sustainable medium-term fiscal framework.7 \n \n(i)  Expenditure  rationalization.  Rationalization  of  public  expenditure  to  better \nsupport growth and human development is important. It essentially improves the \nallocative  efficiency  of  scarce  public  resources.  Medium-term  expenditure \nframeworks (MTEFs) could play an important role in strengthening budget and \nexpenditure management through better utilization of fiscal resources, in line with \nGOWB\u2019s priorities. Thus, MTEFs for the line departments, combined with a top\u2013\ndown  medium-term  fiscal  framework,  are  the  prerequisites  for  effectively \nrationalizing public expenditure. However, an effective MTEF requires both a \nlong-term  sector  strategy  and  a  system  of  project  appraisal  and  evaluation. \nMTEFs cannot be implemented rigorously unless supported by these two tools. \nStreamlining  procurements,  better  targeting  subsidies,8 and  better  monitoring \nsalary  payments  are  also  essential  for  effective  rationalization  of  public \nexpenditure. \n(ii)  Own-revenue reforms. One important prerequisite of fiscal consolidation is that \nstate finances are augmented to the extent possible by own-revenue sources. \nReforming the revenue streams is critical for augmenting own-revenue sources. \nTax policy is only as good as the tax administration that supports it. Given \nGOWB\u2019s  poor  revenue  efforts  compared  with  other  states  in  India,  there  is \nenough scope for improving its efficiency in tax administration. Simplified tax \npolicy and procedures along with compliance-based tax systems and backed by \nrisk-based tax audits can substantially improve tax compliance and thus increase \nown-revenue collection. The proposed program focuses on improving the state\u2019s \nrevenue administration based on these principles of tax management. Similar \ninitiatives in other states of India suggest that strengthening tax administration \nleads to higher revenue collection by (a) reducing the administrative cost of \ncollecting taxes, (b) reducing compliance costs for taxpayers, and (c) improving \nvoluntary compliance. \n(iii)  Better debt management. Debt management based on factual information and \na clear debt strategy that seeks to mobilize resources for physical and social \ninvestments and to achieve a clear and positive gap between returns and costs \nof borrowing has enormous potential for creating fiscal space. \n \n10.  Capacity building and institutional strengthening under the attached TA will be critical in \neliminating the constraints characteristic of the state. Sound business processes cannot be \nimplemented and maintained unless capacity development is an integral part of new initiatives. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be to improve development financing in the state in a sustained manner, \n                                                \n7  Each public resource management program draws on lessons from previous programs, including successful ones. \nThis is a continuous process to improve the loan design for greater aid effectiveness. See for example: (i) ADB. \n2007. Special Evaluation Study: ADB Support to Public Resource Management in India. Manila; (ii) M. Attinasi and \nB. Carrasco. 2008.

South Asia \nWorking Paper Series. No. 2. Manila: ADB. \n8  The analysis based on an effective rate of subsidy methodology suggests that total implicit subsidy was 4.7% of \nGSDP in FY2010 in 14 selected major sectors taken together, excluding education, health, social welfare, water \nand soil conservation, and environment. Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nand the outcome will be the creation of greater fiscal space in the government budget. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  An agreement between ADB and GOWB was reached on the broad areas of ADB\u2019s \nsupport under the fast-disbursing policy reform program: \n(i)  Output  1:  improved  expenditure  efficiency. Moderating public expenditure \ngrowth, and better targeting public funds and improving their allocative efficiency \nwill be achieved through two sets of reforms under the program. The first set will \nhelp GOWB stabilize its finances by containing short-term expenditure.9 This \nincludes: (a) moderating salary growth by restricting replacement of employees \nagainst natural attrition and thus reducing growth in non-discretionary committed \nexpenditure; (b) computerizing the salary payments to teachers at government-\naided  secondary  schools,  and  streamlining  drugs  procurement  and  stock \nmanagement;10 and (c) moderating subsidies. The second set will help improve \ntargeting of public funds and their allocative efficiency, which in turn will help \nrationalize public expenditure in the medium term. The reforms include (a) the \nestablishment  of  a  fiscal  policy  and  management  unit  (FPMU)  in  GOWB's \nFinance Department that will be responsible for project appraisal and evaluation \nto help streamline and better target public expenditure; (b) formulation of long-\nterm sector strategies and road maps in the departments of school education, \nhealth,  and  public  works  that  enable  these  departments  to  prepare  rolling \nMTEFs; and (c) implementation of an integrated financial management system to \nstrengthen public financial management system in the state. All these measures \nwill serve to generate fiscal savings, which in turn will support and sustain a \ngradual increase in the state's capital outlays\u2013GSDP ratio. \n(ii)  Output 2: improved revenue efforts. This entails strengthening tax policy and \ntax administration. First, rationalizing the tax brackets under the profession tax \nwill help GOWB augment its own revenue. Second, revenue administration will \nbe  reformed  by  (a) progressively  reducing  interface  requirements  between \ntaxpayer  and  tax  officers,  (b)  improving  compliance  through  better  service \ndelivery  to  the  taxpayers,  (c)  limiting  tax  leakages  in  transit  of  goods  by \nintroducing barcoding of transit documents, (d) simplifying registration and tax \npayment for one-off transactions, (e) strengthening tax information management, \n(f) strengthening excise tax management, and (g) simplifying property registration \nprocedures. All these measures are expected to help the state raise more funds \nfrom its own sources.11 \n(iii)  Output 3: efficient debt management. The program will strengthen the debt \nmanagement system in the state to ease future debt servicing spikes, and bolster \ninstitutional capacity to manage the stock of state debt effectively. \n \n13.  The program\u2019s strategy is to initiate and partner key reforms for stabilizing GOWB\u2019s \nfinances in line with the directions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, \n                                                \n9  However, these reforms will also help GOWB improve expenditure targeting. \n10 Expenditure tracking surveys carried out under the project preparatory TA (footnote 2) clearly show that there are \nopportunities for expenditure rationalization by streamlining drugs procurement and stock management, and \ncomputerizing salary payments to the teachers of government-aided secondary schools. \n11 Better revenue administration helped the Government of Rajasthan increase commercial tax revenue by 1.5% of \nGSDP between 2001 and 2005 (World Bank. 2005. State Fiscal Reforms in India. New Delhi: Macmillan). Some of \nthese initiatives were (i) setting up of a large taxpayers\u2019 cell, (ii) complete self-assessment, and (iii) 100% \npenetration of information technology-based taxpayers\u2019 services. \n ", "5 \n2010 and generate fiscal space to boost and sustain development financing (capital outlays) in \nthe state. Unless GOWB achieves quick and marked improvements in its public finances, it will \nbe difficult to sustain an elevated level of capital outlays. Greater investment in economic and \nsocial infrastructure is an important prerequisite for sustaining high growth and employment. \nWithout high growth, especially manufacturing growth, the commercial tax base in the state will \nnot grow commensurately with the state\u2019s development financing needs. In other words, the \nprogram\u2019s focus on higher development spending will have an indirect impact, in addition to the \ndirect impact, on additional revenue mobilization, and hence on fiscal space creation, through its \nimpact on growth. Moreover, once public finances are placed on a sustainable path, GOWB will \nbe  in  a  strong  position  to  step  up  service  delivery  and  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  the \nlivelihoods of the people of West Bengal. Finally, West Bengal being a large state, a fragile \nfiscal  situation  in West  Bengal  will  certainly  dampen  the  central  government\u2019s  initiative  to \nconsolidate combined finances of the states and the central government. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n14.  The current fiscal profile of the state does not permit the stepping-up of development \nfinancing. Both fiscal and revenue deficits remained high in FY2010, at 4.1% and 3.7% of \nGSDP, respectively, leaving very little space for development financing (capital outlays). This \nhas severely hurt the state\u2019s growth potential and private investment. Thus, the main focus of \nthe program is to help the state stabilize its finances, which in turn will help it augment and \nsustain development financing. However, even with ADB\u2019s support for reforms and consequent \ncreation of additional fiscal space, it would be too ambitious for GOWB to meet the fiscal deficit \ntarget of 3% of GSDP (stipulated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act) \nin FY2014 unless it were to further sacrifice development expenditure despite the negative \nimpact on growth and development. On the other hand, the program helps the state launch the \nnecessary reforms for a balanced and sustainable fiscal trajectory over the medium term, and \nfor meeting the state's development financing needs. It will contribute to regaining the budget as \nthe main tool to prioritize GOWB\u2019s development objectives. Development expenditure (capital \noutlays) as a percentage of GSDP is expected to rise from 0.7% in FY2011 (revised estimates) \nto 2% by FY2014 and 2.5% by FY2016 under the program. The reforms will generate fiscal \nsavings equivalent to $1.4 billion over the program period, and thereby contribute to the twin \ngoals of sustainability while increasing development spending in a sustained manner. There is, \nhowever, a development financing gap (additional capital outlays in the reform scenario net of \nnew fiscal space created under the program) of $493 million over the program period. ADB\u2019s \nassistance will help cover 81% of the gap.12 This increase in development expenditure will \nenable West Bengal to overcome the low-level equilibrium trap (low public investment - low \ngrowth, especially manufacturing growth - slow expansion in the revenue base - low investment \n[development expenditure] to accommodate nondiscretionary committed expenditure).13  \n \n15.  Based  on (i)  the Government  of India\u2019s  request  and the (ii)  development financing \nrequirements of the policy reform program, ADB will provide a policy-based loan of $400 million \n                                                \n12 A detailed simulation exercise of the state budget is presented in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2) under alternative scenarios. A fiscal deficit\u2013GSDP ratio of 3% could be reached \nin FY2014 if development financing (capital outlays) was restricted to 1.2% of GSDP, against a targeted 2% of \nGSDP. However, this will further delay much necessary growth and development financing in West Bengal. \n13 The share of manufacturing in GSDP was 9.6% in West Bengal in FY2009, against 26% in Gujarat, 21.4% in \nMaharashtra, 18% in Punjab, and 17.4% in Karnataka. West Bengal\u2019s ranking in overall infrastructure availability \ndeclined from 10th in 2006 to 13th in 2010. These figures clearly corroborate the presence of a low-level \nequilibrium  trap  in West  Bengal  (Source:  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Corporation.  2010.  Townhall \nPresentation: www.idfc.com/images/news_release/infra-index-131210-pres-sent-to-mint.pdf). \n ", "6 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement and program \nagreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 10.39 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. The government will relend the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the total loan amount in accordance with its arrangement for transfer of external \nassistance to GOWB. The loan proceeds are expected to be utilized within 18 months from the \ndate of loan effectiveness. The Government of India has provided ADB with the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. A two-tranche policy framework \nwith equal amounts is envisaged, with the first tranche disbursed upon loan effectiveness and \nthe second tranche approximately 18 months after loan effectiveness. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Finance Department of GOWB will be the executing agency and the secretary of the \nFinance Department will be the focal point for matters pertaining to the program. A program \nsteering  committee  (to  be  chaired  by  the  secretary)  will  be  established  and  will  have \nrepresentatives from other departments. \n \n17.  A fiscal policy and management unit (FPMU) will be set up at the Finance Department to \nassist line departments in implementing the program. It will be headed by a senior government \nofficial  as  the  program  director.  In  addition  to  items  under  para.  12,  the  FPMU  will  be \nresponsible for: \n(i)  overall coordination and monitoring of the program, including the policy actions; \n(ii)  preparing and submitting all required reports to the program steering committee \nand ADB; and \n(iii)  helping to implement the attached TA. \n \n18.  Procurement,  advance  contracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The \nprogram will be implemented over 2 years. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram  loans  (ADB.  1998.  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. Manila). ADB will monitor program implementation through \nperiodic progress reports and will field regular missions to confirm fulfillment of policy actions for \ntranche release.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n19.  The TA  will  strengthen  the key  institutions  responsible for  implementing reforms to \nimprove fiscal management performance in the state.14 The TA outputs are: \n \n(i)  Revenue  administration.  The  TA  will  cover  (a)  implementation  of  the  tax \ninformation management system, especially making the payment, recovery, and \nappeal  modules  fully  operational;  (b)  implementation  of  an  excise  tax \n                                                \n14  ADB is also providing assistance to West Bengal under a different TA project for establishing a public\u2013private \npartnership cell to implement public\u2013private partnership projects in West Bengal.

The TA will assist in establishing an FPMU \nin the Finance Department so that rigorous medium-term fiscal programming, \nand appraisal and evaluation of government projects can be done. The TA will \nsupport FPMU in designing manuals and providing expert advice on processes. \n(iii)  Medium-term expenditure frameworks. Support will be provided to the line \ndepartments as well as to relevant officials of the Finance Department to prepare \ngender-disaggregated and poverty-focused expenditure incidence analysis and, \ndrawing on these analyses, prepare relevant MTEFs based on the long-term \nsector strategies.15 This support on implementation will include expert advice and \ntraining. The TA will help design detailed guidelines in various areas. \n(iv)  Integrated financial management system. Technical support will be provided \nto  implement  four  modules  of  the  integrated  financial  management  system. \nThese are (a) drawing and disbursement module (bill preparation, submission, \nmanagement);  (b) employee  database;  (c)  budget\u2013treasury  interface \n(e-allotment); and (d) government revenue receipt portal system. \n(v)  Employee  database.  The  TA  will  help  the  executing  agency  prepare  a \ncomprehensive  and  gender-disaggregated  database  for  employees  and \npensioners. \n(vi)  Debt management. In line with the weaknesses identified in debt management \nin the state, the TA will build capacity in areas of debt management, including \ndeveloping appropriate debt management policies and strategies. \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $875,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  executing \nagency will provide counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, local \ntransport, and other logistical support. \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned to those of the policy-based \nloan.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  implemented  by  the  FPMU  with  overall  supervision  and \ncoordination by the program steering committee. A total of 59 person-months of consultancy \nservices  (national)  will  be  required  intermittently.  The  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  for \nrecruiting the national consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nstandard  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All disbursements \nunder the TA  will  be made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Several outputs of the program have technical components at their core. Stronger tax \nadministration  is  expected  to  arise  from  better  taxpayer  services.  Several  information  and \n                                                \n15 Expenditure incidence analysis is an important prerequisite for designing expenditure norms under MTEFs that are \nbased on gender-specific and pro-poor targets under the relevant sector strategies (primarily for education and \nhealth). Thus, expenditure incidence analysis is the first step to ensure pro-poor and gender-responsive MTEFs. \n ", "8 \ncommunication  technology-driven  initiatives  for  value-added  tax  and  other  state  taxes  are \nproposed to improve compliance. The scope of the tax information management system will be \nenlarged to incorporate several other modules, e.g., payments recovery, appeals. An excise tax \nmanagement system will be set up. Implementation of the integrated financial management \nsystem  requires  sound  technical  knowledge,  as  does  the  introduction  of  project  appraisal \ntechniques and the preparation of the MTEFs. Capacity building support under the program will \nassist the relevant government departments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB.  Economic \n \n23.  The program was subject to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that its \nbenefits considerably outweigh the costs. The key direct benefits considered are (i) reduced \ncompliance costs in revenue administration (due to e-filing of tax returns, for example, and other \ninformation technology-based taxpayer services) leading to higher tax buoyancy; (ii) savings \nfrom greater efficiency and cessation of systemic leakages; (iii) targeted public expenditure on \nhealth and education over the medium to long run; and (iv) reduced debt service burden due to \nbetter management of debt and fiscal consolidation. A comparison between the baseline and \nthe pro-growth reform program scenarios shows that the overall fiscal deficit is expected to be \nreduced  significantly  by  the  end  of  the  program  period  despite  higher  capital  outlays \n(development financing) (Table 2). Fiscal space created under the program, resulting both from \nrevenue  augmentation  and  expenditure  rationalization,  will  contribute  to  this  outcome. \nMoreover, the debt stock\u2013GSDP ratio will decline sharply from 37.24% in FY2012 to 30.62% in \nFY2017.16 \n \nTable 2: Baseline and Reform Scenarios (% of gross state domestic product) \nItem  FY2012  FY2013  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017 \nBaseline Scenario \nFiscal surplus or deficit  (3.99)  (3.39)  (2.84)  (2.71)  (2.50)  (2.30) \nCapital outlays  0.86  1.01  1.16  1.31  1.46  1.61 \nDebt stock  37.09  35.78  34.09  32.48  30.87  29.26 \nReform Scenario             \nFiscal surplus or deficit  (4.14)  (3.43)  (3.18)  (3.12)  (2.99)  (2.60) \nFiscal space created      0.48  0.54  0.58  0.64  0.70 \nAdditional capital outlays    0.50  0.85  0.95  1.05  0.90 \nDebt stock  37.24  35.95  34.58  33.32  32.09  30.62 \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  As part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines  prescribed  by  the  implementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan.17 This assessment was complemented by a review of areas of \npossible risk and vulnerability in state financial management. The assessment found some \nvulnerabilities that could affect the proposed program. They include risks related to (i) political \nsupport for and ownership of GOWB; and (ii) institutional dimensions of the proposed program \n(e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions). The financial assessment found several areas \nof concern: (i) lack of appraisal of investment projects and integration of capital and current \n                                                \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was also explained to and discussed with the Government \n(Finance Department, GOWB). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, implementation of the \nprogram will adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. \n ", "9 \nbudgets, (ii) weak monitoring protocols, and (iii) lack of alignment between sector goals and \nresource allocation.18 While no major risks of mismanagement of resources at the executing \nlevel can be discerned, issues raised in the assessments are targeted for capacity development \nunder the TA during implementation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. The support for \naugmenting and sustaining development financing will have a substantial impact on human and \nincome poverty. While broadly aiming at better cost recovery and revenue mobilization by \nGOWB, the program\u2019s special emphasis on better expenditure targeting, especially in health \nand education, is clearly geared toward protecting the poor and other vulnerable groups. The \nhealth indicators for women and children in the state are poor due to ineffective delivery of \npublic services and lack of adequate budget allocations. This is manifested in many ways. For \nexample, high maternal mortality rates in West Bengal reflect inadequate health services and \nfacilities for antenatal and obstetric care. Rectifying these problems becomes all the more \nchallenging if GOWB is unable to invest in economic and social infrastructure.19 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Given  the  nature  of  the  program,  all  three  safeguard  categories  (environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized as C. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of continued government commitment  The most effective mitigating measure for this risk is to \nto the reforms, and to allocating resources  continually engage with GOWB so that a consistent \nfor their implementation  message is sent about the need to adhere to the reform \nmeasures. \nWeak implementation capacity of the line  Program-specific support will be provided under attached \ndepartments  technical assistance to help the fiscal policy and \nmanagement unit. \nDifficulties in adhering to expenditure- Consistent and sustained engagement with GOWB is \nrationalizing measures, such as provisions in  needed to rule out this possibility.
