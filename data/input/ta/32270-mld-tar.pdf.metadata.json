In response to a request from the Governmento f the Republic of Maldives, the Fact-\nfinding Mission was fielded to the Maldives in September 1999 to gather data for technical\nassistance (TA ) to strengthenl egal education and judicial training. The TA   is to continue the\nwork of TA 2896, Strengthening the Maldivian Legal System.1 Under TA 2896, specific\ncomponents included measures for  improving legal education and  court administration.\nFormulationo f the current TA is based on the outcomeso f the consultants'r eports under TA\n2896; a symposiumh eld in the Maldivesi n March 1998 involvingt he Government,c onsultants,\nprivate lawyersa  nd the Asian DevelopmentB ank (ADB) staff; and subsequentd iscussionsw  ith\nthe Government.T he TA is includedi n the 1999 countryp  rogram.2F ollow-upd iscussionsw  ere\nheld with the Governmenta fter the fact-finding and an understandingw  as reached on the\nobjective, scope, cost estimates, and financing and implementationa rrangements. The TA \nframeworki s presentedi n Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  There  is  presently no  postsecondary  education  institute  in  Maldives  offering  legal\ntraining, even though the country faces a severe shortage of suitably qualified legal personnel.\nPresently, there are about 70 legal practitioners (of whom 3 are female) registered with the\nMinistry of Justice (MOJ). Of these practitioners, about 21 have a law degree from a foreign law\nschool; the others were trained under programs offered by MOJ or the  Institute of  Islamic\nStudies  (115), which  is an educational  institute that focuses on aspects  of  Shariah. These\nprograms do not specifically deal with modem commercial and regulatory matters needed by a\ndeveloping  economy.  TA  2896  demonstrated  the  need  for  lawyers  trained  in  modem\ncommercial  law, and underscored the need for  indigenous capacity in legal education  and\ntraining. Further, the decline of present foreign aid assistance to the Maldives has resulted in\nfewer opportunities for students to undertake foreign tertiary education studies, incJuding legal\neducation.\n3.  All practicing  lawyers  in the Maldives  are located  in the capital  city of Male.  They  are in\nshor1 supply,  and  unable  to meet  the  commercial  and  social  needs  of a developing  country.\nMost  of  these  lawyers  are  attached  to  government  ministries  and  agencies,  and  are  also\nactively  engaged  in private practice  on a par1-time basis.  Legal advice  is not readily  available  to\nthe private  and business  communities.  There  is no professional  regulation  for practicing  lawyers\nin the  country.  The  Law Society  of Maldives  exists  as an  informal,  voluntary,  nongovernment\norganization.  It is open to registered  legal practitioners,  but membership  is not necessary  for the\npractice  of law. Control  over the  conduct  of lawyers  is provided  by MOJ.  MOJ's  functions  also\ninclude  overseeing  the  administration  of  all  cour1s other  than  the  High  Cour1 (which  directly\nrepor1s to the  President),  registering  lawyers  practicing  before  the  cour1s, and  carrying  out all\nmatters  related  to the administration  of justice  not entrusted  to the High  Cour1. The functions  of\nthe Attorney-General's  Office  (AGO)  include  acting  on behalf  of the Government  in the  cour1s\nand providing  legal advice on matters  affecting  the Government.\n4.  The  Maldives  gained  independence  from  the  United  Kingdom  in  1965.  Upon\nindependence,  training  of judges  was provided  by MOJ. In 1982, this function  was transferred  to\n115, which  established  a qazee  course,  which  is based  on Islamic  law. This  course  had  some\nlegal  topics  such  as  property  law,  contract  law, family  law,  and  succession.  A  similar  course\n(mohamee)  was  introduced  in  1988  for  legal  practitioners.  In  the  19905,  the  Government\n1  TA 2896-MLO: Strengthening the Maldivian Legal System, for $150,000,  approved  on 17 October  1997.\n2 The TA ftrst appnred  in ADB Business OpporlunRieisn  May 1999 (Internet Ecfition).", "2\nrealized that increased internationalization and economic development, especially in tourism,\nrequired a higher level of training of its judges and lawyers. Partly in response to this need, the\nqazee and mohamee courses were replaced in 1995 by a three-year diploma course at liS for\nstudents who wish to be judges or lawyers. Under this course, law is taught as a professional\ndiscipline rather than merely as a collection of rules to be memorized. This course involves\nteaching of Shariah and  common law. However, there are no full-time  law professors; the\nlecturers are part-time and include the President. the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General, and\neminent private practitioners. Twenty-eight students were enrolled in this course; 25 graduated\nin 1998. A second diploma course commenced in February 1999. No courses were held in 1996\nor 1997 due to lack of suitably qualified full-time teachers, space constraints within the existing\nfacility, and constraints already imposed on the existing part-time lecturers.\n5.  The Government suppor1st he establishment of a law institute in the country as par1o  f its\nobjectives and priorities in the Fifth National Development Plan (1997-2000). The Institute of\nShariah and Law (ISL) was established by the Government in August 1999 pursuant to a letter\n(No. 99/53) dated 16 August 1999 issued by the Office of the President. ISL's main functions\ninclude formulating and conducting courses relating to education and judicial training in Shariah\nand  law,  including  continuing  legal  and  judicial  education,  for  lawyers  and  judges;  and\nconducting  shor1-term courses  for  Government  officials, the  business  community,  and  the\npublic. In due course, it is planned that ISL will offer programs affiliated with foreign institutions.\nThe Government has taken measures to rationalize the provision of legal education and training\nin Shariah and law, which is presently also par1 of IIS's activities.  The Government's decision to\nshift the diploma course from 'IS to ISL will be implemented shor1ly.\n6.  ISL is under the jurisdiction of the Maldives College of Higher Education (MCHE), which\ncommenced operation in October  1998, pursuant to a  letter (No. 1-G/22/98/342) dated  31\nAugust 1998 issued by the Office of the President. ADB supports the Government's decision to\nestablish ISL and has highlighted to the Government the need to ensure that the establishment\nof ISL is the most effective and least-cost solution for delivering legal education and judicial\ntraining, and that ISL is sustainable. ADB agrees with the Government's decision to locate ISL\nwithin MCHE, as MCHE's primary function is to consolidate and coordinate the administration\nand academic programs of postsecondary education institutes in the country.\n7.  The Maldives has a three-tier court system. The lowest tier comprises 201 first instance\ntrial courts that are administered by MOJ. Of these, four are located in Male (the Male courts)\nand the remaining courts (the island courts) are located on all inhabited islands. The Male\ncourts are separated in jurisdiction by subject matter (civil, criminal, family, and juvenile). The\njudges in the Male courts have foreign law degrees, and most of the judges in the island courts\nhave had training in courses run by 115o r MOJ. The island courts have jurisdiction over all\nclaims, and there is no upper limit on the amount claimed; although as a matter of practice,\nthese courts refer every case to MOJ where the claim exceeds Rf 50,000 (about $4,200). Island\ncourt cases are usually limited to routine family, property, and criminal cases, with commercial,\ncompany, and financial cases for the most part being filed or transferred to the Male courts. The\nmiddle tier is the High Court, which consists of the Chief Justice and four other judges.  In\naccordance with  regulations  issued  by  the  President, the  High Court  reviews judgements\npassed and cases heard by the Male courts and the island courts. In addition, the High Court\nadjudicates on cases referred to it by the Government. The highest tier is the President, who is\nthe  highest authority  on  the  administration  of justice  (Article 39  of  the  Constitution).  The\nPresident appoints all judges to the courts and formulates the rules of court, either directJy or\nthrough MOJ. A body appointed by, and reporting to, the President conduds the administration\nof justice and considers all matters concerning Shariah.", "3\n8.  In the  Fifth National  Development  Plan,  the Government  recognizes  the  need  to ensure\nthe efficiency  of the judiciary  by improving  court  procedures  and providing  professional  training\nto  judiciary  members,  particularly  in  commercial  and  other  laws  that  address  economic\ndevelopment,  and in methods  of alternative  dispute  resolution.  The Government  also recognizes\nthe need to upgrade  the skills of the judges  of the island  courts as they are perceived  to not be\nequipped  to deal  with  complicated  commercial  and  regulatory  problems  arising  from  business\ntransactions  resulting  from  increased  domestic  and foreign  investment.  As  of  November  1999,\nthere were  44 vacancies  in the island  courts,  and an annual  turnover  of 15 percent  is expected\ndue to retirement,  etc. Also, they generally  lack formal  training  as they were trained  by programs\noffered  by MOJ or liS; these  programs  have not been adequate  or updated  to meet present  day\nneeds.  The  Government  has  expressed  an  urgent  need  for  training  to  be  provided  to  new\nrecruits  who will fill the current  vacancies,  and for inservice  training for existing judges.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nObjective\n9.  The  objective  of the  TA  is to  assist  the  Government  in strengthening  the  institutional\ncapacity  of ISL to deliver  legal education  and judicial  training.  The T A will have two components:\nlegal  education  and  judicial  training.  The  legal  education  component  accords  with  the\nGovernment's  desire  to  enhance  ISL's  capacity  to  deliver  legal  education  and  to  build\nindigenous  capacity  in  the  delivery  of  legal  education.  The  judicial  training  component\naddresses  the Government's  need to provide  suitable  training  for judges  to improve  efficiency  of\nthe judiciary  and to provide a special judicial training program for new recruits who will fill the\nI \nexisting  44 vacancies  for island court judges.\nScope\n10.  The legal education component will include (i) provision of consulting services as key\nprofessional staff in the first two years of ISL's operation to develop curriculum and provide a\nminimum number of staff pending the creation of indigenous capacity; (ii) provision of training to\na cadre of professional staff, including law lecturers and a librarian, in ISL to enhance  its\ncapacity to deliver legal education (induding continuing legal education) to students, lawyers,\nGovernment employees, the business community, and the public; and (iii) provision of local\nresource persons to present lectures or courses. Fellowships of about one year each will be\nprovided for three lecturers and a librarian from ISL. Equipment and materials, including four\ncomputers and printers, three photocopiers, training equipment (such as overhead projectors),\nand books and publications (with Internet connection), will also be provided. The equipment and\nmaterials will also be used under the judicial training component. Under this component, ISL's\ncapacity will  be enhanced through preparation of programs of continuing  legal and judicial\neducation, organization and participation in public legal education programs for the benefit of\nthe general community, and a linkage arrangement with a suitable foreign institution.\n11.  The  judicial  training  component  will  include  (i)  provision  of  consulting  services;\n(ii) provision  of training  to  selected  judges  on the  organization  and  delivery  of judicial  training\nand  on  commercial  law;  (iii)  production  of  benchbooks  to  be  distributed  to  the  judges,  and\nprovision  of training  on the  use of the  benchbooks;  (iv) provision  of a special  judicial  training\nprogram  for  44  new  judges  for  the  island  courts  to  be  appointed  by  the  Government;  and\n(v) provision  of  local  resource  persons  to  present  lectures  or courses.  The  T A  will  prbvide\noverseas  study tours for four judges  (about three months  each) on the organization  and delivery\nof judicial  training,  and commercial  law.", ".\n4\nc. .\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,395,000 equivalent, with  a foreign exchange cost of\n$887,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $508.000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $995,000\nequivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $108,000 equivalent of the  local\ncurrency cost. The TA   will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA \nProgram. The Government will finance the  balance of the  local aJrrency cost of $400.000\nequivalent. The Government will finance the items specified in Appendix 2. The detailed cost .\nestimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.\nImplementation Arrangements .\n13.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, with\nMCHE, acting through ISL, as the Implementing Agency. MCHE will carry out the TA activities in\ncoordination with AGO for the legal education component and with MOJ for the judicial training\ncomponent. The TA   will require 70 person-months of consulting services (SO person-months\ninternational and 20 person-months domestic). The consultants will be engaged by ADS in\naccordance with ADS's  Guidelines on the  Use of  Consultants and on other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADS on the engagement of domestic consultants. Individual consultants are\nexpected to be recruited for the legal education component and a firm or institute for the judicial\ntraining component. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be used for consultant\nselection for the judicial training component.\n14.  Fo~t he legal education component,4 4 person-monthso f internationala nd 10 person-\nmonths of domesticc onsultings ervicesa  re needed. The two internationalc onsultants,o ne as\nadvisor, ISL (24 person-months)a nd the other as senior lecturer, ISL (20 person-months)w, ill\nbe required to have expertise in legal education and the legal profession, legal and judicial\ntraining, law and Shariah, curriculum development,a nd managementa  nd running of a law\ninstituteo r faculty.

For the judicial training component, an internationally recruited consultant (6 person-\nmonths) and  a  domestic  consultant (10  person-months) will  be  needed. The  international\nconsultant (judicial training coordinator) will have expertise in judicial training and preparation of\nlegal manuals or benchbooks. The domestic consultant (judicial training assistant coordinator)\nwill have expertise in application of court procedures, and will have demonstrated the ability to\nwrite  in English and Dhivehi. These consultants will  organize overseas study tours for the\njudges and carry out a special judicial training program, all under arrangements satisfactory to\nADB. The consultants will select local resource persons to present lectures or courses, and\norganize the presentations, all also under arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The outline terms\nof reference for the TA   consultants are in Appendix 3. The advisor will act as overall consultant\nleader, coordinate with the other consultants on their activities, and prepare and submit to ADB\na consolidated inception  report within  six weeks  after commencement  of assignment, and\nconsolidated quarterly, draft final. and final reports. The equipment and materials provided\nunder the TA   will be procured by the consultants in accordance with arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB. The TA   is expected to commence in April 2000 and be completed by April 2002.", "5\n16.  The Governmenth as provideds pecifica ssuranceso n the operationalizationo f ISl (e.g.,\nacquiring premises, appointment of a minimum number of staff, and provision of adequate\nbudgetarya  llocations).T  he Governmenth as identifiedt he physical premises of ISl  and has\nassuredt hat renovationw  ork has commencedo n a priority basis. The Governmenth as agreed\nthat the diploma course will be transferred from 115t o ISl  upon commencemento f ISl's\nteaching activities.T  he Governmenth as also agreed that cooperationb etween ISl  and 115in \nthe sharing of faculty for Shariah and library resourcesw  ill be ensured. The Governmenth as\nagreedt hat paymentst o be made by the staff of AGO and MOJ for courses held in ISL will be\nobtainedf rom the training budgetso f AGO and MOJ respectively.\nI \n17.  The Government will set up a faculty advisory committee before the consultants are\nfielded, and will ensure that this committee has representation from the judiciary (MOJ and the\nHigh Court), the Ministry of Education, AGO, the judiciary, the legal profession, and liS.  This\ncommittee will determine curriculum and policies of ISL (e.g., admissions and recruitment of\nfaculty members). Before the consultants are fielded, the Government will ensure that ISL is\nfunctioning with a core team of professional staff members comprising a full-time Director and a\nfull-time Head of Administration  handling administrative matters, and that  ISL is adequately\nstaffed  by full-time  support  personnel.  The  Government has  identified  candidates  for  the\npositions of full-time Director, ISL and full-time Head of Administration, ISL. The Director, ISL\nwill be a person with at least an undergraduate degree in law and knowledge of Shariah or a\ndegree in law and Shariah, and will preferably have teaching experience. The Government will\nappoint the Director, ISL and Head of Administration, ISL shortly. At the time the consultants are\nfielded, the Government will appoint three faculty members, with degrees in law and knowledge\nof Shariah or degrees in law and Shariah, and a librarian, so that the consultants can carry out\nthe fellowship arrangements. The Government will keep ADB  informed of the  progress on\nrenovating the  school  facilities  allocated for  the  setting  up  of  ISL  and  will  complete  the\nrenovation when the core team  of  professional staff members and the support staff are\nappointed.\n18.  The Government will  provide adequate and timely budgetary allocations for  ISL,\nincluding staffing, and operation and maintenancec osts, during and after TA implementation.\nThe Government will  recruit one Assistant Director for  ISL,  in  the  second year of  TA \nimplementation, to be responsible for organizing judicial training programs. The Government will\nprovide use of  ISL, including training facilities and office accommodation,  remuneration of\ncounterpart and support staff, and  miscellaneous TA    administration costs  (including  library\nresources and office equipment beyond those provided under ADB financing).\n19.
