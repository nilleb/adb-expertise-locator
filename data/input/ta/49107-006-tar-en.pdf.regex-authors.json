THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n1.  The proposed West Bengal Drinking Water Sector Improvement Project will ensure \ndrinking water security through continuous piped water supply schemes to about 1.65 million \npeople in arsenic-, fluoride-, and salinity-affected areas of selected districts in West Bengal. It will \nstrengthen institutional structures and build capacities of stakeholders at all levels for sustainable \nservice delivery and public health improvements. Three districts\u2014Bankura, North 24 Parganas \nand  Purba  Medinipur\u2014will  be  covered  under  the  West  Bengal  Drinking  Water  Sector \nImprovement Project.1 The executing and implementing agency of the project will be the Public \nHealth Engineering Department (PHED) of the Government of West Bengal (GOWB). Through \ngrant support, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) mobilized 16 international and national \nconsultants, including the British Geological Survey and an international climate risk vulnerability \nassessment expert, who assisted the PHED in conducting project preparation and due diligence \nin accordance with the requirements of the Government of India, the GOWB, and ADB. \n \n2.  The project will supply a minimum of 70 liters per capita per day of continuous potable \nwater through metered connections to each household in the selected rural areas, and potable \nbulk water at the prescribed national standard to the en route urban and rural areas. The project\u2019s \nwater distribution systems will be designed on a district metering area basis, and connections will \nbe provided up to the household level, including to community and government institutions. The \nwater distribution systems will be integrated with smart water management and monitoring tools \nsuch as supervisory control and data acquisition, geographic information systems, and data \nanalytics and feedback systems incorporating domestic and bulk water meters, to be established \nat the PHED and at the gram panchayat (governing bodies working at the village level) levels.2 \nBulk water supply systems will be interconnected on a grid-based supply system, where feasible, \nto improve the system\u2019s redundancy and resilience. The project will create and strengthen \nsustainable service delivery institutional structures at the district, block, and gram panchayat \nlevels, as well as in the PHED. The project will introduce innovative practices and technology-\ndriven digital smart water management to create a model for rural water service delivery and bulk \nwater supply systems for adoption throughout West Bengal and India. The project is highly gender \nfocused, assisting skills development and employment creation for around 350 locals, of whom \nat least 33% will be women. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  Climate change in West Bengal. Realizing the state\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, \nthe GOWB has prepared and approved the West Bengal State Action Plan on Climate Change.3 \nThe action plan outlines strategies to be adopted by the state, which were developed after \nextensive  consultations  within  and  among  concerned  departments  of  the  GOWB.  The \ninternational climate risk vulnerability assessment consultant engaged by ADB assisted the PHED \nin preparing a climate risk vulnerability assessment for the project. Based on the findings of this \nassessment, the proposed transaction technical assistance (TA), which is predominantly for \ncapacity building, will verify and support the local-level climate vulnerability and disaster risk \n                                                \n1 One neighboring block in 24 South Parganas district is also included under the project based on economy of scale \nand community demand. \n2 The PHED is responsible for (i) rural water supply in the state, fully managing drinking water supply to most of the \nstate\u2019s rural population of 74.6 million; (ii) managing drinking water supply in 80 of the state\u2019s 114 municipalities; and \n(iii) providing bulk water to many urban agglomerations and municipal corporations in the state. \n3 Government of West Bengal. 2016.  West Bengal State Action Plan on Climate Change. Kolkata. \n ", "2   \nassessment for selection and prioritization of gram panchayats or villages and municipalities in \nthe selected districts. This work is a precursor to the design of a flood forecasting and early \nwarning system and a district-level smart water management information and monitoring system, \nwhich aim to enhance the resilience of West Bengal to climate change. \n \n4.  Smart water management. Water systems face sustainability and resilience challenges \nsuch as water leaks, overuse, and quality issues. Floods, droughts, and natural disasters impact \nwater systems through, for example, climate change impacts on water supply technologies, flood \ndamage  to  infrastructure,  increased  contamination,  deteriorating  water  quality,  increased \ntreatment requirements, and reduced water availability. Piped distribution networks are typically \nvulnerable to contamination and will be at increased risk where more frequent flooding occurs. In \ndrying  environments,  piped  water  supplies  may  become  more  intermittent  unless resource \nmanagement measures conserve drinking water sources.4 \n \n5.  Information and communication technology could help address these challenges through \nthe development of smart water grids that network and automate monitoring and control devices. \nWater losses and inefficient use stand out as promising areas for applications of smart water \ngrids. A smart water grid begins at the water source, where meters, smart valves, smart pumps, \nand flood sensors are installed. It continues on to the water treatment plants with more smart \nmeters, valves, and pumps. At the end user locations (homes and businesses), end user sensing \ndevices, smart irrigation controllers, contaminant sensors, and smart meters may be used. Finally, \nwater moves through the sewage system to wastewater treatment and final use or discharge, \nwhere the same technologies used at the beginning of the system are used at the end.5 The \nUrban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund6 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility will \nsupport the exploration of linkages and efforts to make the water supply grid based with smart \ntechnologies in the project districts.7 The TA is predominantly for capacity building. \n \nB.
