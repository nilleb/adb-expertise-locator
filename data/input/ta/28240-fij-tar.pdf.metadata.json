INTRODUCTION\n1. In November 1993, the Government of the Republic of Fiji requested the Bank's\nCountry Programming Mission for an advisory technical assistance (TA) to assist in the\ninstitutional strengthening of the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA). A Bank Fact-finding Mission\nvisited Fiji in April 1995 and reached an understanding with the Government and FEA regarding\nthe objectives, scope, terms of reference, implementation, and financing arrangements for the\nTA. The TA was prepared on the basis of the findings of the Mission and the understandings\nreached with the Government.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Fiji archipelago, comprising some 332 islands in the South Pacific, is spread\nover a total area of about 104,000 square kilometers but has a land mass of only 18,330 square\nkilometers. The total population of over 750,000 inhabit 100 of the islands but about 75 percent\nlive on Viti Levu and 15 percent on Vanua Levu, the two largest islands. Fiji has a relatively high\nincome (per capita gross domestic product) of about US$2,060. Sugar exports and tourism are\nthe principal foreign exchange earners.\n3. Overall primary energy consumption in the country totals about 351 000 tons of\noil equivalent and is growing at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent. Of this, 60.6 percent is\nderived from imported petroleum products, 10.3 percent from coal, and 29.1 percent from\nindigenous hydropower. The country's consumption of petroleum products grew at an average\nrate of 6.1 percent from 1988 to 1992. The transport sector consumes 50.9 percent of the\nprimary energy with industry consuming 28.2 percent, residential/commercial 13.4 percent, and\nother 7.5 percent. The commissioning of the 80 megawatt (MW) capacity Monosavu\nHydropower Scheme in October 1983 significantly reduced the country's dependence on oil.\nAbout 82.6 percent of the country's power supply comes from hydropower and the rest is\ngenerated from diesel and other thermal sources.\n4. The Ministry of Lands, Mineral Resources and Energy (MLMRE) in consultation\nwith the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development formulates policies and programs for\nFiji's energy sector - including the power subsector. FEA is responsible for the generation,\ntransmission, and distribution of electric power in Fiji. Power supply for small isolated\ncommunities and on outer islands is provided by the Department of Works. The Authority is a\nwholly Government-owned statutory body that was established under the Electricity Act of 1966.\nInitially, its operations excluded power supply to the city of Suva and nearby towns, which was\nthe responsibility of the Suva City Council Electricity Department. With the acquisition of this\nCouncil in July 1978, FEA became the sole electric power utility in Fiji.\n5. FEA is supervised by a board of eight members comprising a Chairman, Deputy\nChairman, the Chief Executive Officer, and five other members (the Permanent Secretary of\nMLMRE, the Permanent Secretary of Public Works, and representatives of business and\nconsumer groups). All the members are appointed by the Minister of MLMRE except for the\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 1995.", "2\nChief Executive Officer, who is appointed by the Board, with the approval of the Minister. As of\nDecember 1994, FEA had about 1,180 officers and staff. Together with the Chief Executive\nOfficer, FEA's management consists of a General Manager for Corporate Services, General\nManager for Engineering, General Manager for Finance, Regional Manager (Central), and\nRegional Manager (Western).\n6. FEA maintains power supply systems on the larger islands of Viti Levu, Vanua\nLevu, and Ovalau, which account for some 90 percent of the country's population. Installed\ngenerating capacity is approximately 158 MW, comprising 80 MW in the Monasavu scheme on\nViti Levu and about 78 MW of diesel capacity in 11 stations in the three islands. Of this capacity,\n69.9 MW is on Viti Levu but is substantially unutilized, having been displaced on the\ncommissioning of Monasavu. Maximum demand in the Viti Levu Integrated System at the end\nof 1994 reached 72 MW. Transmission is provided by 140 kilometers (km) of 132-kilovolt (kV)\nlines (connecting Monasavu's Wailoa Power Station to the east and west coasts) and about 257\nkm of 33-kV lines. Power distribution is by means of 1,759 km of 11 -kV and lower voltage lines.\n7. The Government is preparing legislation for the corporatization/cornmercialization1\nand possible privatization of certain public sector utilities and companies. The Public Enterprise\nBill has been drafted and is programmed to be considered by the Parliament in the fourth\nquarter of 1995. With the passage of this Bill, major Government utilities and statutory authorities\nare expected to be reorganized and their activities rearranged to place them on a more\nindependent and commercial footing. To this end, the Government wishes to complete an\noperational review of FEA and to strengthen it institutionally. In particular, the Government has\ntargeted FEA's functions encompassing the following for streamlining and improvement: (i)\nsystem planning and project development, including opportunities for build-own-operate\nschemes; (ii) financial planning, corporate modeling, accounting, and information systems; (iii)\nplant operations including optimization of energy production from the Monasavu scheme; and\n(iv) upgrading of systems and skills in budgeting, cost control, and development of a marketing\nstrategy.\n8. The foreseen corporate changes to FEA will coincide with an important phase in\nits technical operations. The Monasavu scheme has now reached the limits of its power output,\nand FEA and the Government must shortly decide on future generation options for the utility.\nIn 1993, FEA-financed consultants reviewed the Authority's power development program, and\nsix or more hydropower schemes have been studied. However, with the continuing substantial\nvariations in world oil prices and other factors, FEA needs to monitor constantly its power\ngeneration expansion project options and development program. To facilitate this, it is essential\nthat FEA staff develop the capability to carry out such analyses to the required professional\nstandards. To achieve this, FEA's capability must be assessed and training provided where\nnecessary.\n9. Another important issue to be addressed is the need for facilities to ensure that\nFEA derives, and continues to derive, the maximum benefit from its 80-MW Monasavu scheme.\nThis facility has been supplying most of the electrical energy requirement cf the Viti Levu\nIntegrated System and represents a very large investment for the country. However, the output\nInvolving the formation of an independent entity operated along commercial lines.", "3\nof the scheme is limited, for various technical reasons, to about 71 MW, and FEA needs to\ndetermine if this restriction can be mitigated or the available hydrological resources utilized in\na more efficient manner. Systems need to be developed in the managerial and financial areas\nto support these technical functions. Computerized financial projections for FEA are needed,\nand a management information system developed to provide senior staff with feedback on day-\nto-day technical and commercial operations. FEA's accounting and budgeting systems also\nrequire a review to determine their adequacy to assist the utility in the more onercus\nresponsibilities it will face in its commercialized role in the future.\n10. Overall, FEA is a well managed utility. Its system operating costs are reasonable\nand the level of system losses low. Billing and collection systems are well managed. In 1993,\nFEA showed a net profit on its operations of US$11.10 million (F$15.59 million), which was 3.2\npercent greater than in 1992. Revenue of US$56.52 million (F$79.43 million) was derived from\npower sales in 1993 and another US$1.12 million (F$1.58 million) from other activities. Total\nrevenues have grown about 23 percent since 1990.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n1. The TA will review the operational efficiency of FEA and strengthen its institutional\napacity, including training, prior to its corporatization and commercialization. The TA will\nexamine FEAs management structure and general capability in its main financial/commercial and\ntechnical operational areas, and recommend measures for improvement and rectification. The\nadequacy of FEA's tariffs, accounting, and management reporting systems will be reviewed,\nrecommendations for improvement made, and staff trained to implement these measures. The\noperational limitations, methods, and aids available for operating FEA's main generating plant\n(especially Monasavu) also will be reviewed, and improvements, including additional facilities,\nrecommended. The utility's long-term development plans will be updated and the financial\nimplications of developing further hydropower (or other) sources, or (alternatively), utilizing\nexisting reserve diesel capacity, will be studied. Alternative designs for the Vaturu Power Project\n(to utilize the full discharge of the dam, rather than the excess over the existing water supply\nscheme) need to be investigated. Training, where necessary to upgrade FEA staff skills, also\nwill be undertaken. Based on the review and identification of problems, an action plan will be\nformulated to implement the reform measures. Special attention and priority will be given under\nthe TA to ensure that the means are provided under the action plan to implement the identified\nremedies and other recommended measures to guarantee the maximum benefits.\nB. Scope\n12. The TA will provide 14 person-months of services of an international firm of\nconsultants that, with the support of counterpart staff of both the Ministry (MLMRE) and FEA, will\nassist in the areas of accounting systems, budgeting, information systems, project analysis, least-\ncost development program analysis, and financial modeling. Specialist input by the consultants'\nteam leader also will be provided in the fields of management and institutional analysis.\nTechnical services will be furnished in hydrology and hydropower scheme design and plant", "4\noperating systems. Training will be provided in selective areas to improve FEA's institutional\ncapabilities, especially for its system and financial planning functions, project analysis, and\npower plant operations. The benefits of the TA will be to increase the overall efficiency of FEA\nas well as to increase the institution's capability for independent system analysis and long-term\nplanning. The TA will focus on the following tasks and aspects of FEA's operations and\nfunctions:\n(i) review FEA's management structure and capability and recommend strengthening\nmeasures; review staff levels and skills mix; examine existing accounting and\nbudget systems; and review existing and proposed management information\nsystems;\n(ii) examine FEA's operating costs and review the adequacy of present tariff levels\nand financial projections; advise on opportunities for build-own-operate type\nschemes; review FEA's Viti Levu system's historical demand and demand\nforecasts and methodology; and examine FEA's latest generation and\ntransmission development program;\n(iii) implement improvements to FEA accounting and billing systems; help FEA\ndevelop a management information system; update FEA's financial model and\nprojections and train staff in improving model; and train FEA staff in load\nforecasting methods and revision of its forecasts;\n(iv) review the condition and efficiency of the FEA generating plant; identify\noperational ways to increase plant efficiency and security; and review the\nadequacy of plant control and operating facilities; and\n(v) assist and train FEA staff in the revision of its generation development program;\nreview past studies and confirm the next hydropower project for development;\nimplement training programs where required; and instruct staff in various aspects\nof hydropower scheme design, project planning, procurement, and other relevant\naspects.\nThe detailed terms of reference for the TA are shown in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$498,000, of which US$450,000 is the\nforeign exchange cost and US$48,000 equivalent the local currency cost (see Appendix 2). The\nTA will finance the foreign exchange cost of US$450,000 equivalent, on a grant basis. This will\ncover the consulting team's field and home office services including remuneration, international\ntravel costs, per diem, accommodation, and out-of-pocket expenses. The local costs will be met\nby the Government and FEA on a pro-rata basis to provide, in kind, office facilities, support\nservices, local transportation, and counterpart staff.", "5\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Directorate of Energy in MLMRE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The\nTA's implementation will require the recruitment of a firm of international consultants, which wiH\nbe engaged by the Bank in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA\nwill be implemented over a period of 12 months, expected to commence in January 1996 with\nthe fielding of the consultants and be completed in December of that year. The services will be\nundertaken in two phases. Phase I, covering about three months, will produce an action plan\nspecifying tasks designed to be implemented in the second phase. Phase II, covering nine\nmonths, will concentrate on the implementation of measures identified in the action plan,\nincluding training of FEA staff. FEA staff will carry out most of the work, with the consultants\nmaking periodic visits to site to provide guidance and staff training. The consultants' team leader\nwill be the management/institutional specialist.\n15. To coordinate activities with the various Government institutions and to provide\ninformation and guidance during the course of the TA, a Project Coordinating Committee will be\nformed with representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, MLMRE,\nFEA, and the Public Enterprise Unit of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry Trade and Public\nEnterprises.\n16, The consultants will submit an inception report within six weeks of the\ncommencement of the TA. Brief monthly reports will be submitted thereafter. An interim report\nwill be submitted at the completion of Phase I, and will incorporate the action plan containing\nactions and tasks recommended by the consultants under the terms of reference. A draft final\nreport will be submitted at the completion of the TA and will summarize the findings of the\nconsultants and record the activities and training carried out. Tripartite meetings between the\nGovernment. FEA, and the Bank will be held at the completion of the first and second phases\nto discuss and agree on the action plan in the interim and draft final reports. A final report will\nbe completed one month after receipt of comments on the draft final report.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the\nRepublic of Fiji in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of US$450,000 for the purpose of\nInstitutional Strengthening of the Fiji Electricity Authority, and hereby reports his action to the\nBoard.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE CONSULTANTS\nA.\t Objectives and Scope\n1. The objective of the Technical Assistance (TA) is to strengthen the institutional\ncapability Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA). A study of the medium- to long-term power generation\ndevelopment program has recently been carried out for FEA by consultants financed from its\nown resources. However, many important institutional aspects of FEA's operations need to be\nreviewed and measures introduced to improve its functions. The TA will examine the\nmanagement structure of the utility and its general capability in its main financial/commercial and\noperational areas and recommend measures for improvement and rectification. The adequacy\nof FEA's tariffs, accounting, and management reporting systems will be reviewed;\nrecommendations for improvement made; and staff trained to undertake these measures.\nAdditionally, the TA will recommend the means to improve FEA's planning capability, including\nits financial planning function and procedures and systems to improve the efficiency of FEA's\ntechnical operations. The development of planning tools and training needs of FEA staff will also\nbe reviewed and training undertaken. The TA also will investigate alternative development and\noperations programs for FEA utilizing existing generating plant capability as well as identify\nopportunities for private power developments under build-own-operate or other arrangements.\n2. The findings of the Phase I comprehensive review of FEA's operations will be used\nto formulate an action plan designed to be implemented in Phase II. The plan will set out an\nimplementation schedule for the recommendations with specification of resources required and\ntiming of each part of the plan. The action plan will be target-oriented and monitorable.
