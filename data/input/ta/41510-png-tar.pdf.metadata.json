INTRODUCTION \n1.  Public financial management (PFM) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has deteriorated since \nits  independence  and  limits  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  services.  The  2008\u20132009 \nmidterm review of the PNG country strategy and program 2006\u20132010 confirmed that PFM would \nremain  one  of  the  program\u2019s  key  focal  areas.1 PFM  is  also  central  to  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategies, particularly through the Public Sector Reform Program, which underpins the medium-\nterm development strategy by seeking to create the conditions and capacity for the Government \nto deliver its development objectives, institutions, and systems. PFM reform efforts are focused \nthrough the public expenditure review and rationalization process, which is a joint government\u2013\ndevelopment partner program coordinated by the multiagency public expenditure review and \nrationalization implementation committee. Moreover, initiatives to enhance aid effectiveness are \nset out in the 2008 PNG Commitment on Aid Effectiveness,2 which localizes the 2005 Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.3 \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) is intended to help strengthen PFM in PNG by enhancing \noversight of statutory authorities, improving project evaluation and prioritization, strengthening \nprocurement  arrangements,  enhancing  transparency  and  monitoring  of  subnational  service \ndelivery, and supporting the development of domestic bond markets. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4 In conceptualizing the assistance, consultations were conducted \nduring the country strategy and program midterm review with particular consultations on the TA \nconcept paper during 25 February\u20139 March 2009. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Following a decade of deterioration, the country\u2019s PFM arrangements improved from \n2004\u20132008\u2014albeit from a low base. The Government has pursued a PFM reform program \nsince 2003, when PNG was emerging from a recession and public finances were under serious \nstrain due to poor fiscal discipline, weak expenditure management, and a high debt burden. A \n2008 public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment confirmed progress in \nseveral  PFM  areas.5 Macroeconomic  stability  improved  as  budget  surpluses  have  been \nachieved since 2004, the debt burden is lower and more balanced, and a proportion of windfall \nrevenues were set aside for future use. Budget preparation is more orderly, transparent, and \nconsultative, and headway has been made on clearing public accounts\u2019 backlogs.  \n \n4.  Despite  these  improvements,  PFM  remains  weak,  thus  impeding  the  Government\u2019s \nability to control expenditures, disburse the budget as approved, and provide essential services. \nFundamental  arrangements  are  in  place,  but  implementation  weaknesses  mean  that  the \nsystems and procedures for expenditure and payroll control cannot be relied upon to ensure \nappropriate accountability. Transparency in budget execution is weak, with budget integrity \nundermined by unauthorized diversion of funds (including resources for regional development). \nHence,  it  is  difficult  to  track  expenditures  to ensure  the budget  is delivered  as  approved. \nOversight has been weakened by delays in preparing and releasing public accounts and audit \nreports. Statutory authority accountability is particularly weak. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Papua  New  Guinea:  Public  Financial  Management \nPerformance Report. Port Moresby. \n ", "2   \n5.  As a consequence of the global economic crisis, PFM systems are likely to be tested \nwhile  adjusting  to  more  austere  fiscal  conditions.  With  tighter  fiscal  constraints,  project \nevaluation and prioritization will be critical, as will robust procurement systems to ensure results \nare delivered. PNG\u2019s fiscal decentralization program has accelerated in recent years, thus \nplacing  increased  service  delivery  responsibilities  on  provinces  and  districts.  Improving \ndevelopment outcomes will depend on strengthening subnational PFM systems. The global \neconomic crisis is also putting pressure on PNG\u2019s continued progress in reducing net foreign \ncurrency debt. Market conditions do not currently favor issuing a bond denominated in local \ncurrency, but this is likely to change. In the meantime, planning and preparations can be \nundertaken. The TA is intended to support responses to these issues in the five areas outlined \nbelow. \n \n6.  Statutory authority governance. First, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided \nassistance  in  2007\u20132008  to  review  statutory  authority  governance  arrangements. 6  Two \nconsultants worked under the guidance of a Treasury-led interagency working group, which was \nestablished to provide project guidance. The consultants\u2019 report concluded that although the \nstatutory authority framework appears quite rigorous according to international norms, it has \nsignificant  weaknesses.  In  response,  the  report  recommended  (i)  creating  a  public  body \nclassification methodology; (ii) strengthening Part VIII of the Public Finances (Management) Act, \n1995 to require performance agreements between the minister and the public body, enhancing \nenforcement powers regarding noncompliance, and incorporating guidelines for establishing \npublic bodies; (iii) enhancing monitoring capacity within central agencies; (iv) introducing annual \nperformance agreements between boards and responsible ministers; and (v) an orderly and \nrigorous process for establishing or restructuring public bodies. The interagency working group \nis working on items (i), (ii), and (v) and has requested ADB support to move forward on items (iii) \nand (iv). \n \n7.  Investment evaluation and prioritization. Second, the Department of Treasury (the \nFinancial  Evaluation  Division  and  the  Structural  Policy  and  Investments  Division)  and  the \nDepartment  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring  undertake  investment  evaluation  and \nprioritization.  Guidance  is  not  readily  available  for  preparing  and  reviewing  economic  and \nfinancial analyses of potential investment projects, however, and not all responsible officials are \nconversant with the application of relevant tools and techniques. Budget availability, particularly \ndue to constraints as a result of the economic and financial crisis, will make it even more critical \nto have tools and techniques for appraising potential public investments. The Department of \nTreasury currently faces severe staffing constraints, which limits its ability to discharge its \nfunctions, but it will shortly recruit up to 53 new officers, a significant portion of whom will have \nsome  responsibility  for  evaluating  projects.  The  Department  of  Treasury  has  sought  ADB \nassistance to strengthen project appraisal capacity. \n \n8.  Procurement.  Third,  while  the  procurement  framework  is  reasonably  sound, \nimplementation is problematic. For instance, contract finalization may take upwards of a year \nduring which time contractors may no longer be available, costs may have altered significantly, \nand the operating environment may have changed. The Central Supply and Tenders Board \n(CSTB) plays a lead role in procurement processes. Through the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness,  the  Accra  Agenda  for  Action,  and  the  2008  PNG  Commitment  on  Aid \nEffectiveness, the Government and development partners have agreed to work together to \nstrengthen and use government systems, including systems for procurement. ADB already \nrelies on government systems for procurement, but there is scope for improvement. ADB and \nthe World Bank jointly prepared a country procurement assessment report (CPAR) in 2003, \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Support for Public Expenditure Review and \nRationalization. Manila (TA 4947-PNG, $500,000, approved on 29 June). \n ", "  3\nwhich  was  updated  in  2006,  and  identified  a  range  of  recommendations.  A  Procurement \nEngagement  Group  has  also  been  established  to  improve  procurement  arrangements  and \npractices. Chaired by the CSTB, the group comprises development partners, including ADB, as \nmembers. Further progress is being made with the establishment of an Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development-supported  project  management  unit,  which  is  working  with  the \nDepartment of Prime Minister and the National Executive Council to improve the timeliness of \ncontract awards. The PNG Commitment on Aid Effectiveness tasks the Government, the CSTB, \nand development partners (led by the World Bank) with updating the CPAR.7 The European \nCommission also intends to undertake an institutional procurement assessment as it considers \nwhether to provide budget support. The ADB Central Operations Services Office conducted \nregional procurement training in PNG in November 2009. \n \n9.  Service  delivery.  Fourth,  PNG  is  increasingly  decentralizing  service  delivery \nresponsibilities to poorly resourced provincial and local governments. The capacity of provincial \nand  local  governments  to  administer  and  implement  projects  will  need  to  be  enhanced \nsignificantly  if  increased  expenditure  is  to  translate  into  improved  public  service  delivery. \nImproving development outcomes will depend on addressing PFM system problems at the \nsubnational level. Service delivery has improved with support from the Service Improvement \nProgram, which is being implemented by the Public Sector Reform Management Unit within the \nDepartment of Prime Minister and the National Executive Council. Nevertheless, much more \nremains to be done. Among other things, there is a need to improve monitoring and tracking of \nbasic service delivery outcomes. The National Economic and Fiscal Commission (NEFC) has \nmade significant progress in tracking public provincial expenditures that has helped to identify \nimpediments and promote ways to improve essential service delivery. In the last 3 years, the \nGovernment has significantly increased funding to the district level through the District Services \nImprovement  Program,  which  places  increasing  strains  on  already weak  PFM  systems.  In \nparticular, the Government has significantly raised its grants for development spending to K14 \nmillion ($5.04 million) for each of PNG\u2019s 89 districts. ADB has begun piloting, on a limited basis \nwithin three selected districts, surveys to evaluate the service delivery. There is an opportunity \nto upscale this initiative based on the pilot\u2019s results. \n \n10.  Domestic  debt  market  development.  Fifth,  financial  markets  (arguably)  facilitate \neconomic development through more efficient allocation of capital.8 In that connection, the \nGovernment  has  made  consistent  efforts  in  recent  years  to  develop  the  bond  market. \nInformation provision has improved, average tenors have increased, and the government bond \nyield curve now extends to 15 years. In 2007, the Department of Treasury (Financial Evaluation \nDivision) established the PNG Bond Market Development Project. As part of these efforts, the \nGovernment has requested ADB assistance to develop the policy framework for potential listing \nof government securities on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange and the development of the \nsecondary market as a whole. The Government has also expressed interest in ADB\u2019s local \ncurrency loan product because this would support the medium-term debt strategy objective of \nreducing net foreign currency debt and contribute to the objectives of the PNG Bond Market \nDevelopment Project. ADB and the Government have held discussions since late 2006, when \nthe ADB Treasury Department visited PNG to discuss with authorities the prerequisites and \nprocesses for a kina-denominated bond issue. The Government requested ADB to consider the \nfeasibility of such an issue in August 2008.  \n                                                 \n7  Government of PNG. 2008.

These  five  activities  are  demand-driven  and  support  ADB\u2019s  ongoing,  broad-based \nengagement in PFM.9 The activities are also intended to support ADB\u2019s operations, both current \nand future. The proposed work on strengthening oversight of statutory authorities recognizes \nthat the Government is increasingly devolving functions to statutory authorities in sectors where \nADB is active (for example, the National Roads Authority and potentially the Civil Aviation \nAuthority). As such, efforts to strengthen statutory authority monitoring are of direct relevance to \nADB. In addition, improved project evaluation and prioritization and improved procurement \npractices are directly relevant to the preparation and implementation of ADB-supported projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed TA is intended to strengthen PFM arrangements and contribute to more \nefficient  and  effective  public  administration\u2014more  specifically  toward  delivering  better \ngovernance through improved transparency, accountability, and efficiency in managing and \nusing public resources. This is to be achieved through targeted interventions in five priority \nareas. Performance will be measured primarily through updated CPAR and PEFA assessments, \nas well as by joint ADB\u2013World Bank annual country performance assessments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Strengthened oversight of statutory authorities. The TA will work with the Treasury-\nled interagency working group to (i) identify and seek participation in the exercise of 10 pilot \nstatutory authorities,10 (ii) review available information and information systems, (iii) agree to key \nperformance  indicators  and  identify  any  additional  information  requirements,  (iv)  work  with \nagencies  to  design  and  establish  the  enhanced  monitoring  process,  and  (v)  identify \nrequirements and approaches for extending the enhanced monitoring process. \n \n14.  Improved project evaluation and prioritization. The TA will work with the Treasury \nand the Department of National Planning and Monitoring11 to (i) prepare guidance materials for \neconomic and financial analysis of investment projects, (ii) develop three case studies of project \nanalysis that are relevant to the PNG setting, and (iii) conduct four workshops on project \nanalysis and project financing approaches. \n \n15.  Improved procurement practices. The TA will support ADB\u2019s efforts, in conjunction \nwith the Government and other development partners, to strengthen procurement arrangements \nand practices. ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office will participate in this process. \n \n16.  Enhanced subnational service delivery monitoring. Based on the outcome of an \nexisting ADB-supported pilot study of service delivery, it is proposed that the TA will support \n                                                 \n9  The processing in late 2006 of supplementary financing for the ADB-supported Financial Management Project \ninvolved  assessing  project  status.  That  revealed  critical  weaknesses,  in  response  to  which  ADB  and  the \nGovernment identified remedial actions. ADB and the Government were ultimately unable to confirm these \nremedial measures and supplementary financing processing was discontinued in early 2008. Meanwhile, due to \nthe identified project weaknesses, project implementation fell further behind schedule.  \n10 The interagency working group has proposed the following statutory authorities: (i) Mineral Resources Authority, \n(ii) Civil  Aviation  Authority,  (iii)  National  Fisheries  Authority,  (iv)  National  Forest  Authority,  (v)  Independent \nConsumer and Competition Commission, (vi) Papua New Guinea Radiocommunications and Telecommunications \nTechnical  Authority,  (vii)  National  Maritime  Safety  Authority,  (viii)  National  Agriculture  Research  Institute, \n(ix) National Research Institute, and (x) Investment Promotion Authority. \n11 The Government is also making efforts to rehabilitate the PNG Institute of Public Administration. For instance, a \nnew director was recently appointed. The capacity of the institute to participate in training design, development, \nand delivery will be considered. \n ", "  5\nupscaling this pilot. This will involve refining the survey instrument and methodology, as well as \nextending the survey to 10 selected districts. Districts will be chosen in areas where ADB is \nactively engaged, such as the highlands provinces. District sample selection will also take into \nconsideration the income groupings of provinces to which districts belong. This would be in line \nwith NEFC\u2019s income classification of provinces based on their revenue-generating capacity. \nWorking with NEFC, the purpose of the surveys will be to track services actually delivered \nagainst the recorded expenditures. \n \n17.  Domestic debt market development. The TA will work with Treasury and the Bank of \nPNG to identify issues requiring resolution prior to any proposed issuance of an ADB-backed \nkina-denominated bond. The TA will also develop the policy framework for potential listing of \ngovernment securities on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange and development of the secondary \nmarket as a whole. This will include considering institutional, regulatory, taxation, and legal \narrangements. A detailed road map toward a local currency bond issue and toward creation of a \nsecondary bond market will be prepared and agreed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to cover \nconsulting services, report production, and miscellaneous administrative and workshop costs. \nThe Government will provide the remaining $100,000 equivalent as in-kind contributions to \ncover office accommodation and support services (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Department of Treasury will be the executing agency and implementing agency for \nstatutory  authority  oversight  and  domestic  debt  market  development  components.  The \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring will be the implementing agency for the project \nevaluation component. CSTB and NEFC will be the implementing agencies, respectively, for the \nprocurement and for the service delivery survey activities. In addition to the Department of \nTreasury, the TA will be implemented in close cooperation with the Department of Finance, \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring, Department of Prime Minister and National \nExecutive Council (Public Sector Reform Management Unit), CSTB, and development partners. \n \n20.  International  consultants  (29  person-months)  and  national  consultants  (12  person-\nmonths) will be engaged with expertise in economic and financial analysis, statutory authority \ngovernance, procurement, bond market development, and legal and financial management. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  engage  an  international \nconsulting firm using the quality-based selection method and through requesting simplified \ntechnical proposals in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.12 The TA is expected to be implemented over 36 months \ncommencing in January 2010 and finishing in December 2012. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  for  Supporting  Public  Financial  Management,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2008.
