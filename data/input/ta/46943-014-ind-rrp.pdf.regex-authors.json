I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $18,400,000 to Champion Agro Limited for the Horticulture Cold Chain Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Rural poverty remains an acute development problem in India. In 2009\u20132010, rural \npoverty incidence stood at 33.8% (as opposed to 20.9% in urban areas). India is still home to \nsome 280 million rural poor.1 While agriculture remains the main source of rural livelihood, rural \npoverty  can  also  be  reduced  through  the  expansion  of  post-harvest  operations  and  food \nprocessing,  which  provide  both  market  linkages  to  farmers  and  nonfarm  employment. 2 \nHorticulture specifically represents a strong opportunity for poverty reduction. Horticulture is \nconsidered a type of high-value agriculture as it gives a higher rate of return to farmers per unit \nof land than the production of staple crops. It can also sustain agro-industries, which generate \nsubstantial employment. The World Bank estimated that year-round, full-time employment can \nbe generated by a one-hectare shift from cereal to vegetable in one planting season.3 \n \n3.  Horticulture in India has grown significantly in recent years. While staple crop production \nhas grown by 2.8% a year during 2007\u20132012, horticulture production has grown at 4.7% in the \nsame period (footnote 2). The horticulture sector now contributes about 28% of agricultural \ngross domestic product (GDP) from about 13% of the area under cultivation. Demand for \nhorticulture products is likely to continue to grow even faster on account of both internal and \nexternal demand. The consumer basket in India is undergoing changes, with preference shifting \nto perishables such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. As the second largest producer of \nfruits and vegetables in the world (after the People\u2019s Republic of China), India is also a major \nexporter.4 Horticulture represents 37% of the total exports of agricultural commodities.5   \n \n4.  Horticulture production, however, remains constrained by the weak post-harvest and \nmarket infrastructure and the fragmentation in value chains and production systems. These \nresult  in  high  post-harvest  wastage  of  fresh  produce  estimated  to  be  about  35%  of  total \nproduction\u2014equivalent  to  Rs350  billion  in  value  terms\u2014and  very  low  processing.6 The \ninadequate facilities for storage also result in considerable fluctuations in the price of products \nthrough the season (footnote 2). These key constraints can be addressed through upgrading \nboth public and private agribusiness infrastructure and supporting value chain aggregators and \nfood processors. Accordingly, post-harvest and cold storage facilities have been included in the \ngovernment\u2019s definition of infrastructure to provide incentives to the financial sector. \n \n5.  In June 2012, Champion Agro Limited approached Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nfinancing a $22.8 million investment, over 2 years, for a horticulture cold chain project. The \n                                                      \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Forthcoming. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2013\u20132017.

However, a study conducted in Punjab from FY2007 to FY2009 concluded that post-harvest \nwastage was 6%\u201318%. Whatever the exact baseline, the potential for wastage reduction remains great. \n ", "2 \nproject is central to the company\u2019s strategy of adding value to the production of fresh fruits and \nvegetables, improving supply chain efficiency, and expanding access to customers in key cities. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s nonsovereign strategic agenda of pursuing agribusiness \ninvestments with high potential for developmental impact. Champion Agro was found to be one \nof the most reputable agribusiness sponsors in India, creditworthy, and well placed to leverage \nADB\u2019s funds toward development. \n \n6.  The project is fully consistent with the objectives of India\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u2013\n2017 for the farm sector: (i) higher productivity in farming; (ii) higher value for farming; and (iii) a \nmajor expansion of post-harvest activities, including storage and processing. To achieve these \ngoals, the plan calls for (i) developing integrated value chains for high-value segments of \nagriculture; (ii) encouraging private investment in cold chain and food processing; (iii) linking \nsmall  farmers  with  markets  through  producer  companies  and  corporate  retailers;  and  (iv) \ncontinuing with policy reforms allowing private sector markets and contract farming (footnote 2). \n \n2.  Project Design \n7.  The project will have the following four components across the horticulture cold chain: \n(i) five collection centers, (ii) a controlled atmosphere cold storage facility, (iii) an individually \nquick frozen facility, and (iv) five distribution centers. The project will support Champion Agro\u2019s \nhorticulture business from the collection of fresh fruits and vegetables from farmers in Gujarat to \ntheir distribution to corporate clients in large Indian cities and abroad. \n \n8.  Champion Agro will set up five collection centers in Gujarat (Navsari, Junagadh, Prantij, \nRajpipla, and Borsad), with total capacity of 50,000 tons of fruits and vegetables per year. Each \ncenter will include (i) a cleaning, grading, and packing line; (ii) a pre-cooling chamber; (iii) a \nholding  cold  store;  (iv)  a  warehouse;  and  (v)  reefer  vans.  The  collection  centers  will  be \nstrategically located near farms. The major produce collected will be bananas and mangos.   \n \n9.  The controlled atmosphere cold storage facility will be located in Palanpur (Gujarat) and \nwill have a capacity of 5,000 tons of fruits and vegetables per year. It will provide long duration \nstorage for fruits and vegetables to ensure the smooth supply of the produce when the supply is \nlow and the demand is high and to reduce food wastage. The facility will include (i) a pre-cooling \nchamber;  (ii)  a  holding  cold  store;  and  (iii)  a  controlled  atmosphere  cold  store  (in  which \ntemperature, humidity, and concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide are regulated). The \nmajor produce stored will be apples, pears, oranges, lemons, and pomegranates. \n \n10.  The individually quick frozen facility will be located in Gundasara (Gujarat), with capacity \nof 8,000 tons of fruits and vegetables per year. The individually quick frozen technology (often \nreferred as IQF) is a food preservation technology where fresh food passes through the low \ntemperature zone very quickly, leaving very low and safe microbial counts. The major produce \nprocessed will be sweet corn, green peas, green vegetables, mango cubes, and papaya cubes. \nThe majority of the produce (around 70%) will be exported. At least five important ports are \nlocated within a radius of 150\u2013200 kilometers of Gundasara. \n \n11.  Champion Agro will set up five distribution centers in large cities of Northern India \n(Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Delhi, Ludhiana, and Panchkula), with capacity of 60,000 tons of produce \nper year. The distribution centers will service supermarket wholesalers (e.g., Bharti, Walmart, \nCarrefour, Future Fresh, Reliance Fresh, and Safal) and food processors in areas of large \ndemand  for  fruits  and  vegetables.  The  centers  will  source  produce  from  the  company\u2019s \ncollection centers and controlled atmosphere cold storage facilities, as well as local producers. \n ", "  3 \nEach center will include (i) a cleaning, grading, and packing line; (ii) a pre-cooling chamber; and \n(iii) a holding cold store. The major produce stored for final distribution will be bananas. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s commercial and technical consultant visited the proposed locations and confirmed \nthe suitability of the areas in terms of existing and potential horticulture production; proximity to \nmarkets; availability of workers; and access to roads, water, and electricity. \n \n3.  The Borrower \n13.  Champion Agro is a leading Indian agribusiness company from Gujarat. Established in \n1990, the company was originally named Magnetic Industries and its initial business was the \nmanufacturing of agricultural irrigation systems. In 2005, the company devised the concept of \nagro retail malls\u2014one-stop shops for farmers selling agricultural inputs (e.g., seeds, pesticides, \nand fertilizers) and equipment (e.g., farm machinery, greenhouses, and irrigation systems). In \n2008, the company entered into the processing of fresh fruits and vegetables, supported by \ncontract farming and leased farmland.7 In 2010, the company renamed itself Champion Agro to \nreflect the company\u2019s new core business focus on agribusiness. \n \n14.  Champion Agro is a unique agribusiness player in India, in that it is fully integrated from \nthe provision of agricultural inputs to farmers up to the delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to \ncorporate retailers. The company owns a chain of 44 agro retail malls in Gujarat, and has plans \nto  scale  up  this  model  in  selected  Indian  states.  Champion  Agro  is  directly  involved  in \nagricultural activities, with about 5,000 hectares under lease farming and about 12,000 hectares \nunder  contract  farming  in  Gujarat.  The  company  supports  the  cultivation  of  seeds \n(e.g., chickpea, peanut, and sesame) to supply its agro retail malls, along with fresh fruits and \nvegetables that are bought back to be processed and distributed. The company owns and \nleases processing, storage, and distribution facilities across several Indian  states (Gujarat, \nHimachal Pradesh, and Delhi). Other businesses of the company include cattle feed production, \nmanufacturing of irrigation pumps and greenhouses, and farm services (testing, consultancy). \n \n15.  Champion Agro directly employs about 200 people, including at least 170 with university \neducation in agronomy and agribusiness. In addition, about 8,500 farmers work under contract \nand lease farming with the company; 15,000 have been trained in scientific crop cultivation \npractices, and 40,000 have benefited from the company\u2019s consultancy services.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output  \n1.  Impacts  \n16.  The project will contribute to increased horticulture growth in India. According to the \nobjectives in the Twelfth Five Year Plan, horticulture production growth will increase to 6.5% per \nyear during the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017 from 4.8% per year during the Eleventh Five \nYear  Plan,  2007\u20132012  (footnotes  1  and  2).  The  project  will  contribute  to  private  sector \ndevelopment by promoting an increase in lending for pre- and post-harvest activities (a priority \nsector monitored by the Reserve Bank of India) from Rs146 billion in FY2011 to at least Rs400 \nbillion in FY2017.8 As such, the project will contribute to a reduction in post-harvest wastage of \n                                                      \n7  Under the lease farming model, the company leases land from farmers (on a yearly basis) and conducts all \nagricultural activities with scientific inputs such as soil and water testing, land leveling, and installation of drip and \nmicro irrigation systems; all output is for captive consumption. Under the contract farming model, farmers conduct \nagricultural activities while the company provides inputs, guidance, and guaranteed purchase of the crop. \n8  Reserve Bank of India. 2013.

New Delhi; see the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) for assumptions used for the FY2017 target. \n ", "4 \nfruits and vegetables, although this impact is hard to quantify (wastage is currently estimated \nbetween 6% and 35%). Reduction in post-harvest wastage will contribute to more efficient use \nof water resources. India is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, and most \nwater demand comes from agriculture. Reduction in post-harvest wastage and more water-\nefficient agriculture are essential to meeting the impending water crisis in India.  \n \n17.  The project will contribute to a reduction in rural poverty in Gujarat from 26.7% in \nFY2010 to 20.0% by FY2017, in line with the Twelfth Five Year Plan\u2019s national poverty reduction \nobjectives, by including farmers in the horticulture value chain.9 According to a recent paper, \nformal value chains \u2015tend to provide greater income security but not necessarily higher prices. \nWhen higher incomes do occur, it is often from higher yields, improved quality, or value-added \nactivities.\u2016 10 This is where an integrated company like Champion Agro can make a difference. \nThrough its agro retail malls, consultancy services, and contract farming, Champion Agro helps \nfarmers focus on high-value crops, increase in yields, and improvements in the quality of their \nproduce. Processing and storage activities add value to the produce. Finally, the elimination of \nintermediaries can help farmers capture a higher share of the final price paid by the consumer. \nAccording to Champion Agro, an incremental income of about 35%\u201350% accrues to farmers \nfrom an association with the company.11 ADB will consider conducting a distribution analysis \nduring project implementation to validate the direct poverty reduction benefits of the project, as \nwell as its gender inclusion benefits given the importance of women in agricultural production. \n \n18.  Finally, the project will contribute to improved nutrition in India. A minimum of 400 grams \nof fruits and vegetables per day is recommended for the prevention of chronic diseases and the \nalleviation of micronutrient deficiencies.12 In India, only 15% of the population consumed this \ndaily minimum in 2005.13 The project is expected to contribute to an increase in that proportion.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n19.  The project\u2019s expected outcome will be increased processing and distribution of quality \nfruits and vegetables sourced from local farmers and supported by technical assistance from the \ncompany  on  high-yield  water-efficient  technologies.  Champion  Agro\u2019s  sales  of  fruits  and \nvegetables are expected to increase from about $2.6 million in FY2012 to at least $18.3 million \nin FY2017. The number of company\u2019s employees is expected to increase from 200 in FY2012 to \nat least 300 in FY2017. The number of farmers working with the company under contract and \nlease farming is expected to increase from 8,500 in FY2012 to 15,000 in FY2017. The land \nconverted to high-yield water-efficient agriculture is expected to increase from 12,000 hectares \nin FY2012 to 20,000 hectares in FY2017.14 Higher yields will be achieved through better water \nmanagement and more efficient irrigation systems, better seed selection and better usage of \npesticides, and soil and water testing to determine the optimum utilization of agricultural inputs. \n                                                      \n9  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

Technical Assistance Report: Innovations for More Food with Less Water. Manila), which \ntargets improved water efficiency and increased yields for 100,000 hectares and 50,000 poor farm households. \n ", "  5 \n \n3.  Outputs \n20.  The first output of the project is the successful completion of the company\u2019s horticulture \ncold  chain  investment  plan  by  FY2016.  The  second  output  is  the  implementation  of  the \ncompany\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  and  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) by FY2016. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n21.  According to Strategy 2020, supporting agriculture is an \u2015underlying component of the \ninclusive  growth  strategy\u2016  because  \u2015the  majority  of  the  poor  still  live  in  rural  areas,  and \nagriculture remains a source of productivity improvement, seasonal employment, and income \ngrowth\u2014especially when connected to urban, industrial, and export markets.\u201615 As such, the \nproject  is  particularly  relevant  because  Champion  Agro  is  connecting  farmers  to  urban \nconsumers and export markets. The project is also consistent with Strategy 2020\u2019s objective of \nscaling up private sector development and private sector operations in all operational areas. \n \n22.  Under the forthcoming country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, agribusiness is \none of the sectors to be supported by the Private Sector Operations Department: \u2015ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations will explore new investments in agribusiness to support the government\u2019s \nstrategy of developing integrated value chains for high-value segments of agriculture and linking \nsmall farmers with markets.\u2016 The forthcoming country partnership strategy also insists on the \ncritical need to improve agribusiness infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses and increase \nvalue-adding processing through the \u2015aggregation of horticulture produce, post-harvest (e.g., \ngrading, sorting, and packaging), storage, and market facilities in a more integrated manner \nemploying an integrated value chain approach.\u2016 (footnote 1) \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n23.  The project is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy. In particular, the \nOperational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, 2009 recommends an \u2015expanded partnership \nwith the private sector\u2016 to attract \u2015more direct investments in productivity enhancement, agro-\nprocessing, agro-retailing and other nonfarm rural business.\u2016 The project also addresses the \noperational plan\u2019s objective of \u2015increasing synergy and value addition in the backward and \nforward linkages along the food and agriculture value chain.\u2016 Improved linkages along the value \nchain enhance productivity, employment opportunities, exports and regional trade, but also food \nsecurity for the poor in both rural and urban areas.16  \n \n24.  Horticulture has been the focus of ADB\u2019s sovereign assistance to the Indian agriculture \nsector since 2010. ADB funded horticulture value chain studies and investment projects in Bihar \nand  Maharashtra.17 An  ongoing  South  Asia  Department  study  involves  a  review  of  the \nhorticulture value chain in six other Indian states. Since Gujarat is one of the selected states, \nthe  South  Asia  Department  agreed  to  involve  Champion  Agro  in  this  study,  allowing  for \n                                                      \n15 ADB. 2008.

The \n ", "  7 \nAspects  Arrangements \narrangements  company is already operating similar supply chain facilities, including 14 collection centers \nand four cold storage facilities in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and New Delhi. Additional \ntechnical specialists will be recruited and trained to run the new facilities. \nSupply arrangements  Most produce will be sourced from local farmers based on the contract farming model \n(e.g.,  baby  corn,  banana)  or  from  the  company\u2019s  own  production  on  leased  land \n(e.g., pomegranate). Both models provide long-term comfort to the company in terms of \nvolume, price, and quality of supply. \nPerformance  Champion Agro will report on key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nindicators. \nmonitoring \nSource: Champion Agro.  \n \nF.  Unique Features \n28.  The  project  promotes  inclusive  agricultural  value  chains.  Champion  Agro  will  assist \nfarmers in switching to high-value horticulture cultivation and in reducing post-harvest losses. By \nentering into contract farming arrangements with farmers and providing them with post-harvest \ninfrastructure, Champion Agro will link farmers to markets for fresh fruits and vegetables in India \nand abroad. The project will also promote formal employment in the cold chain sector. This \nproject will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign agribusiness project in India. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n29.   The proposed assistance is a senior secured loan of $18.4 million. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n30.   ADB will provide long-term fixed-rate financing, which is not readily available in this \nsector. ADB\u2019s assistance will contribute to raising the profile of a medium-sized company with \nstrong growth potential. As Champion Agro becomes larger, Indian commercial banks\u2014which \nare already providing short-term working capital loans to the company\u2014will be expected to \nreplace ADB as providers of long-term loans to finance the company\u2019s capital expenditures. The \nproject will have synergies with ADB\u2019s public sector support to the horticulture sector in India, \nand will contribute to the government\u2019s objectives of promoting private sector investment and \nemployment in high-value agriculture and agribusiness infrastructure. ADB\u2019s assistance will also \npromote the adoption of environmental and social best practices in the sector. Overall, the \nproject will set an example for private sector-led horticulture cold chain investments in other \ndeveloping member countries, which will benefit from the lessons learned in India.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n39.   In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environment and category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are \nincorporated in the safeguards reports and plans. Potential impacts are limited to wastewater \nand solid waste generation, noise, odor, occupational health and safety, and community safety; \nand such impacts can be prevented and mitigated using tested and proven measures. The \nfacilities will be operated in accordance with the provisions of the Food Safety Act, 2012. The \n ", "8 \nfacilities  will  also  adopt  pollution  prevention  including  energy  efficient  measures  and \noccupational health and safety practices. The initial environmental examination addresses all \npotential environmental impacts and specifies adequate mitigation measures in accordance with \nthe relevant World Bank Group guidelines for food and beverage processing.18 Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements. The institutional capacity and commitment of Champion Agro to manage the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. A corporate audit conducted \non Champion Agro\u2019s current operations indicate that while its existing facilities\u2019 operations are \nnot pollution-intensive, some measures are needed to improve the management of agricultural \nwaste residues and treatment of generated wash water. Champion Agro has committed to adopt \nan ESMS including a corrective action plan before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. Champion Agro \nhas also committed to step up its institutional capability, engage a consultant at the initial stage \nto implement its ESMS, train its own staff to implement the ESMS agreed on with ADB, and \nsubmit annual monitoring reports to ADB.19 \n \n40.   ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  provisions  requiring \nChampion Agro to comply with national labor laws and to take specific measures (including in \nrelation to contractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards for the ADB-\nfinanced  portion  of the  project,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy.20 No \nspecific gender measure is integrated into project design, so it is classified as \u2015no gender \nelements.\u2016 However, the project does not cause any specific cultural or social impacts or \nexclude any socioeconomic group, including women. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies \n41.   Champion Agro was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering, and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nrequires Champion Agro to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money-\nlaundering activities and the financing of terrorism and to covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n42.   The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n43.   Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to  Champion Agro will be \nobtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n                                                      \n18 International Finance Corporation. 2007.
