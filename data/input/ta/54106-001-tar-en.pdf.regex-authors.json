INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enhance knowledge sharing; \ncontribute to increased capacity of policy makers and project managers; and promote innovation, \ndemonstration, and replicability of development projects among Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). The TA will support knowledge sharing through the \nidentification, capture, and sharing of innovative practices and lessons from ADB's engagement \nwith the People's Republic of China (PRC). Dissemination will be done through knowledge \nproducts; multimedia products; and knowledge events such as trainings, workshops, and field \nvisits for government officials from other DMCs. The TA will explore new collaboration with \nexternal  institutions  and  enable  close  coordination  among  ADB  operations  departments  in \nidentifying and designing these knowledge activities. \n \n2.  While the TA is not included in the current country operations business plan for the PRC, \n2019\u20132021, it is in line with the country operations business plan priority of developing knowledge \nproducts that can be shared with other developing economies.1 The TA will support the new \ncountry partnership strategy and the country knowledge plan being developed for the PRC for \n2021\u20132025. The new strategy and the plan note that ADB's future policies, strategies, and \nprojects to support the generation and dissemination of knowledge\u2014both within the PRC and \nacross the region\u2014will be identified, designed, and delivered through TA and partnerships with \ngovernment counterparts, research institutions, and centers of excellence.2 The TA is in line with \nStrategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priority  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity, \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB has been engaging with the PRC to address remaining development challenges, \nespecially on inclusive and sustainable growth; environment and climate change; and social and \nhuman development including health, aging, and education. ADB\u2019s engagement emphasizes \nknowledge-based solutions as the PRC seeks to put its economy on a more sustainable trajectory \nwhile dealing with a wide array of complex issues (footnote 1).  \n \n4.  During the knowledge retreat of the East Asia Department (EARD) in December 2019, \nmanagement and staff from other ADB regional and knowledge departments emphasized the \nneed to intensify collaboration among departments to capture and share the knowledge learned \nfrom the PRC\u2019s development experience, and to replicate successful interventions in other DMCs. \nThese departments expressed interest in learning from ADB\u2019s engagement with middle-income \ncountries, and from the PRC\u2019s success in several areas.  \n \n5.  While there have already been efforts to replicate and share good practices from ADB\u2019s \nengagement in the PRC, there is still room to systematically capture and share these lessons. \nThe need to strengthen the systematic documentation and dissemination of knowledge and \nlessons from ADB projects in the PRC was noted by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department \nin its country partnership strategy final review validation.4 While recognizing that knowledge \nsharing activities have contributed to the replication of successful projects, the report noted that \n \n1 ADB. 2019.

The report also noted the \nlimited  systematic  efforts  to  document  knowledge  and  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  innovative \ndemonstration projects in the PRC.  \n \n6.  This TA aims to address the lack of a systematic process for ADB to capture and share \nproject knowledge and increase interactions among DMCs and ADB departments. The TA will \nprovide a venue to share project knowledge and experiences. By doing so, the TA (i) creates \nformal mechanisms to capture and share knowledge and innovative practices from ADB projects; \n(ii) effectively identifies, captures, and documents lessons and practices; and (iii) contributes to \nincreased project knowledge of government officials from ADB DMCs. By strengthening these \nprocesses, the TA aims to contribute to the successful and innovative development practices \nacross ADB DMCs, especially on project design and implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: project design and implementation in ADB\u2019s \nDMCs improved.5 The TA will have the following outcome: commitment of DMCs to integrate \ninnovative  and  successful  practices  into  project  design  and  implementation  increased. 6 \nSpecifically, this TA aims to have at least two DMCs indicate their willingness to adopt innovative \nand successful practices from the PRC into one of their projects.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Cases and multimedia products on ADB projects in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China produced. The TA will produce knowledge products, including cases and multimedia \nproducts on ADB projects in the PRC. It will help identify ADB-supported development projects in \nthe PRC that can serve as demonstration projects to other DMCs. Knowledge products will be \ndeveloped on these projects and published in various formats including publications, infographics, \nand multimedia products. These products will be disseminated through study visits and other \nknowledge events to help facilitate knowledge sharing among DMCs. These products will mostly \nbe disseminated through digital means, although knowledge products may be printed per request \nof participating DMCs, especially when used in training and knowledge events, and when \ntranslated products are needed for wider dissemination within DMCs.  \n \n9.  Output  2:  Lessons  from  ADB  projects  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \ndisseminated to other developing member countries. Dissemination of lessons from ADB \nprojects in the PRC will be done through knowledge events that focus on areas where the PRC \nhas a history of strong success, including urban development, poverty reduction, and rural \ndevelopment. The TA will also support an annual regional workshop with a selected special-\nthemed study that touches on emerging development issues facing the PRC. The special themes \ncould include aging, public health, climate change, and environmental protection. This will serve \nas the main platform for creating and sharing knowledge relevant to the operations in the East \nAsia region and can cover both the strategic issues usually covered by the Regional Knowledge \nSharing Initiative (RKSI) knowledge events, and project-based knowledge and experience. Virtual \n \n5  The impact is defined by the TA.  \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nor online training activities may also be conducted, given the uncertainty for physical meetings \nbrought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n \n10.  Output  3:  Knowledge  and  understanding  of  government  officials  on  new  and \ninnovative practices in project design strengthened. Training and knowledge events will be \nconducted to build the capacity of government officials from DMCs through the sharing of project-\nbased experience of the PRC. These activities could include training, workshops, and webinars, \nincluding train-the-trainers for government agencies. Study visits may also be conducted to allow \ngovernment officials from other DMCs to learn from actual ADB projects in the PRC. These \nactivities  will  primarily  focus  on  experiences  in  innovative  technologies  and  approaches  in \nimplementing key projects in the PRC, and will involve interaction with project team leaders, local \nand national government officials, and beneficiaries of identified projects. Project consultants who \nwere involved in implementing selected projects could also share their project experiences. \nLessons from ADB projects in the PRC, both successes and failures, will also be shared in order \nto better understand what worked and what did not in (i) the PRC\u2019s path to development and (ii) \nthe collaboration between ADB and the PRC. Virtual or online training activities may also be \nconducted given the uncertainty for physical meetings brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nStudy visits will be scheduled, keeping in mind the travel restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n11.  To identify ADB projects in the PRC that have strong demonstration effects, the Office of \nthe Director General (EAOD) of EARD, in close coordination with ADB\u2019s PRC Resident Mission \nand other ADB regional departments, will hold annual consultation meetings with government \nofficials of the PRC and other DMCs to identify projects that have strong demonstration and \nreplication potential. EAOD will also consult with other ADB regional and knowledge departments \nto identify specific areas in ADB operations in the PRC that are of interest to other DMCs.  \n \n12.  To effectively promote demonstration and replication of the PRC\u2019s project experience, a \ncall for proposals will be opened to all ADB DMCs. The call for proposals will allow the TA to \nsupport activities proposed by other ADB departments that aim to capture innovative and good \npractices from projects in the PRC and encourage replication. The call for proposals will be \nopened to ADB departments at least twice per year. Considering inputs from the Government of \nthe PRC and other ADB departments, EAOD will develop the criteria to evaluate and select \nactivities and amounts to be supported by the TA.  \n \n13.  The TA will build on the achievements of past TA, including EARD\u2019s RKSI, which primarily \ndraws on the PRC\u2019s experience to facilitate exchange of development-related knowledge among \nADB\u2019s DMCs. This TA can complement current RKSI efforts by linking project-level discussions \nto RKSI\u2019s discussions of strategic issues such as the PRC\u2019s poverty reduction experience and its \n5-year plans. In particular, the TA provides a new knowledge sharing platform through an annual \nflagship regional knowledge sharing event to share crosscutting and thematic issues and project-\nbased learnings and experiences. The knowledge products developed through the TA could be \nshared through various channels, such as the Development Asia website, which was established \nwith the support of the TA for Knowledge Solutions.7 Likewise, knowledge products that address \nstrategic development issues identified in the PRC and Mongolia under the TA for Supporting \nStrategic Knowledge Products and Research Networking could be used as learning materials \nduring workshops and trainings.8 Existing regional platforms, such as  the Greater Mekong \nSubregion and Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, as well as knowledge sharing \nplatforms, such as the RKSI, the ADB Institute, and CAREC Institute, will be effectively used.  \n \n7 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Knowledge Solutions. Manila.  \n8 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Supporting Strategic Knowledge Products and Research Networking. Manila. \n ", "4   \n \n14.  Given the cross-regional nature of the study, the TA approach is most appropriate to \neffectively  liaise  across  DMCs  and  ADB  departments  in  identifying  needs  and  designing \nappropriate knowledge products and events. To monitor the impact of these events and outputs, \npre- and post-activity evaluations will be conducted. Close coordination with other participating \nregional and knowledge departments will also be undertaken at least 6 months and 1 year after \nthese activities to monitor impacts of the TA. Attention will be paid to how lessons from the TA \nactivities have contributed to or have been replicated in other ADB projects.       \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) ($250,000 from TASF 6, and $250,000 from TASF-\nother sources) and the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation \nFund9 ($500,000).The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n16.  The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund will \nfinance operational expenses related to TA and other eligible initiatives agreed upon by the MOF \nPRC and ADB, including consulting services, training conferences, workshops small-scale civil \nworks and/or other associated demonstration level equipment and materials.  \n \n17.  The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA. EAOD, in coordination with the ADB PRC Resident Mission, \nwill hold annual consultations with the Government of the PRC in identifying demonstration \nprojects that the DMCs can possibly learn from and replicate. EAOD will lead discussions with \nADB regional and knowledge departments to identify areas where DMCs are interested to learn \nfrom the PRC operations experience. EAOD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \norganize  workshops;  oversee  the  publication  of  knowledge  products;  evaluate  and  select \nproposals from other DMCs to be supported by the TA; and provide staff to act as resource \npersons in the knowledge and capacity development activities, as necessary.   \n \n19.  Cofinancier requirements. ADB will provide PRC Fund with periodic reports (e.g., \nprogress reports, additional updates on project implementation) and support the fund\u2019s visibility \nas outlined in the PRC Fund Contribution Agreement (2017) and its implementation guidelines. \nFor major changes in project scope, duration, or funding arrangements, the TA team will circulate \ndraft memos to the Partner Funds Division of the ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department for review prior to approval. \n \n20.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented from 21 December 2020 to 21 December 2023. ADB will be \nthe executing agency of the TA, with ADB\u2019s EAOD as the implementing agency. \n  \n \n  \n9 The fund was originally named \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d in \nthe 2005 Board paper. \n \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  21 December 2020\u201321 December 2023  \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank  \nImplementing agency  Office of the Director General, East Asia Department, ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nIndividual: Individual  Area experts,  $240,000 \nconsultants selection,  economists (480 \nquality- and cost-based  person-days) \nselection \nIndividual: Individual  Editors, analysts,  $120,000 \nconsultants selection,  researchers, \nquality- and cost-based  communications \nselection  specialist, multimedia \nproducers (750 \nperson-days) \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursement arrangement is on pro rata basis. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n22.
