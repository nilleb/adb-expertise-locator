INTRODUCTION \n1.  Papua New Guinea's (PNG's) and Timor-Leste's extensive borders with Indonesia have \npotential for expanded trade and tourism benefits through the creation of economic corridors. \nPNG and Indonesia signed agreements on customary and traditional border crossings as early \nas 1993. Despite renewed effort since 2006, PNG is unable to open its border posts for vehicle \ncrossings  due  to  lack  of  infrastructure  and  institutional  capacity  on  border  management.1 \nSimilarly, in 2003, Timor-Leste and Indonesia signed the Agreement on Traditional Border \nCrossing and Regulated Markets. Poor and/or nonexistent border infrastructure and border \nmanagement services, however, have made it difficult to implement the agreement.  \n \n2.  In  February  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  hosted  meetings  of  senior \nofficials between Indonesia and Timor-Leste, and between Indonesia and PNG. These meetings \nrecognized  that  joint  cooperation  between  the  countries  has  great  potential  to  generate \neconomic  and  social  benefits  that  complement  each  country\u2019s  national  actions  along  their \ncommon borders. Thus, aside from dealing with border demarcation, security, and immigration \nissues, the three countries recognized the necessity of improving connectivity through transport \nand communication links, and trade and tourism facilitation.2 The Regional Operations Business \nPlan: Pacific 2007\u20132010 emphasizes on the design and implementation of well coordinated \nnational and subregional activities as they offer economies of scale and opportunities to share \ncapacity by (i) strengthening national ownership of regional approaches, (ii) increasing the \nregional  provision  of  services,  and  (iii)  improving  the  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment.3 The  business  plan  has  given  priority  to  supporting  the  development  of  key \nsubregional infrastructure and complementary trade facilitation services in the PNG\u2013Indonesia \nand Timor-Leste\u2013Indonesia border areas to improve connectivity and promote opportunities for \nincreased regional trade. The regional technical assistance (TA) is in line with ADB's Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy, which aims to support poverty reduction through regional \ncollective action based on four pillars: (i) programs on cross-border infrastructure; (ii) related \nsoftware,  trade,  and  investment;  (iii)  money  and  finance;  and  (iv)  regional  public  goods. 4 \nEnhancing subregional economic corridors through improved cross-border links will address the \nfirst two pillars. The Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014 highlights regional cooperation as playing an \nimportant complementary role in operations at the country level. 5 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Constraints  inhibiting  growth  of  economic  corridors.  The  border  areas  in  both \nTimor-Leste and PNG face common challenges of geographic isolation, small size, a limited \nresource base, and a lack of human resource capacity compared with their neighbor Indonesia. \nThere  are  also  significant  infrastructural,  institutional,  organizational,  and  policy  constraints \ninhibiting  growth  of  economic  corridors  between  Timor-Leste  and  Indonesia.  Removal  of \nphysical constraints will require investment in transport and trade infrastructure to create and/or \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) upcoming Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Project is \nexpected to build border infrastructure and provide policy frameworks for investment in the West Sepik Province in \nPNG. \n2  ADB technical assistance (Supporting Strengthened Regional Cooperation Among Pacific Developing Member \nCountries) has identified at a preliminary level a range of potential investments, institutional strengthening, and \ncapacity building that would facilitate increased cross-border trade and investment. \n3  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 20 October 2009. \n ", "2   \n   \nupgrade  competitive  routes  for  trade.  Removal  of  institutional  constraints  will  mean \nstrengthening  of  border  management  and  trade-  and  tourism-related  institutions,  including \nimproving customs, immigration, quarantine, and security (CIQS) services. Finally, removal of \npolicy  constraints  will  require  harmonization  of  transport,  transit,  trade,  and  tariff  policies, \nincluding fostering of private sector growth. Assistance for building capacity to establish systems, \nprotocols, and methods to provide border management services as well as to facilitate cross-\nborder trade, investment, transport, and tourism is a first step in preparing the countries to \nparticipate  in  economic  corridor  activities  with  their  neighbors.  These  activities  include  (i) \ndeveloping institutions and skills for providing integrated border services comprising CIQS; (ii) \ncreating an enabling policy and institutional environment for cross-border trade, investment, \ntourism,  and  other  forms  of  cooperation;  and  (iii)  strengthening  and  promoting  domestic \ninfrastructure links with cross-border trade and investment, multisector development, and public-\n\u2013private partnership.  \n \n4.   Recent  developments  in  cross-border  cooperation  with  Indonesia.  Bilateral \ndiscussions between PNG and Indonesia on border development, border management, cross-\nborder  trade,  tourism,  and  transport  links  are  held  at  three  levels:  (i)  Joint  Ministerial \nCommission (JMC) (co-chaired by the minister of home affairs of Indonesia and the ministers of \nforeign affairs in PNG and Timor-Leste), (ii) border liaison meetings (chaired by governors of \nborder provinces in each country), and (iii) border-official meetings at the technical and working \nlevel with representatives of concerned agencies. Defining of the borders with Indonesia is \nbeing completed through the JMC led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).7 The Joint \nBorder Committee and the Border Liaison Committee under the MOFA-led working group on \nborder issues act as the nucleus agency for coordinating border issues with Indonesia.8 The \nministries of foreign affairs in both PNG and Timor-Leste will require support for activating the \nworking  groups  and  technical  subcommittees,  especially  for  border  liaison,  trade,  tourism, \ntransport, and communication for bilateral meetings and agreements. \n \n5.  Institutional settings for national management of cross-border links. PNG's Border \nDevelopment Authority (BDA), Ministry of Trade and Commerce, Commission on Customs, \nDepartment  of  Immigration,  and  provincial  administrations  of  the  border  provinces  are \nresponsible  for  improving  cross-border  links,  especially  with  Indonesia.  The  BDA  was \nestablished in October 2008 to address the needs of six border provinces with Indonesia, and \nparticularly to develop infrastructure and facilitate foreign and local investment. The BDA also \nsupports the MOFA on bilateral border management issues with Indonesia, and it is expected to \nfacilitate  integrated  border  management  services  and  promote  economic  corridors  in \ncooperation with agencies concerned with CIQS as well as infrastructure, trade, commerce, \ntourism, and industry. The BDA needs assistance to develop a border development strategy \nand assess the long-term investment needs to build the northern economic corridors linking \nPNG  with  Indonesia.9 ADB's  Pilot  Border  Trade  and  Investment  Development  Project  is \nexpected to build border infrastructure and provide policy frameworks for investment in the West \nSepik Province in PNG.10 \n                                                 \n7   About 97%\u201398% of the borders have already been agreed upon between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. \n8  The JMC comprises five working groups: (i) border issues; (ii) judicial issues; (iii) education, culture, and sports; (iv) \ntrade, investment, and finance; and (v) transport, communication, and public works. These groups work with their \nIndonesian counterparts to develop common protocols and agreements. \n9  The Government of PNG has approved the Ten Year Development Master Plan 2010\u20132020 prepared by the \nBorder Development Authority. The plan has three main pillars: (i) social services infrastructure, (ii) national \nsecurity infrastructure, and (iii) infrastructure and economic corridor.  \n10 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance to Papua New Guinea for the Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Project. Manila (Loan \nNo. 2591-PNG and TA No. 7393-PNG). \n ", "  3\n \n \n6.  In Timor-Leste, the Government is seeking integrated border development and border \nmanagement  operations  through  the  newly  installed  Border  Operations  and  Coordination \nCouncil  (BOCC)  under  the  guidance  of  the  Prime  Minister's  Office.  The  BOCC  has  both \ncoordination and management functions for border services, border development, and border \nmanagement. A draft decree law on the establishment of the BOCC is awaiting approval by the \nCouncil of Ministers.11 The BOCC envisions creating an integrated border management and \nborder service, including single-window border service. The BOCC is expected to take on \nfurther facilitation roles for economic corridors activities, such as cross-border transport and \ntrade. \n  \n7.  Strengthening trade, tourism, and infrastructure links. Both PNG and Timor-Leste \nwill need support to enhance infrastructure and communication links, and trade and tourism \ndevelopment with Indonesia. In Timor-Leste, the Ministry of Tourism, Commerce and Industries \nhas a strong interest in working with other sector agencies to promote trade and tourism. The \nministry needs capacity to improve systems and regulations for traditional border markets, \nprovide  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  trade  and  tourism  development,  and  examine \npotential for enhancing trade and tourism benefits, including economies of scale and scope for \nexpanded trade through private sector investment. Similarly, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) \nhas prioritized its investment in the border area. Two ADB projects in Timor-Leste, to be \nimplemented by the MOI, are expected to support road networks and related infrastructure in \nthe border provinces.12 Support to the MOI will be required to develop an investment plan for \ncross-border transport and trade infrastructure, and cross-border transport and communication \npolicies and agreement.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.    The impact of the TA will be improved cross-border trade and enhanced subregional \nintegration through increased trade and travel between PNG and Indonesia and between Timor-\nLeste and Indonesia. The impact will be measured by the rate of growth of the value of trade in \ngoods and services between PNG and Indonesia and between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. The \nvalue of trade in goods and services is expected to grow by at least 10% per annum. The \noutcome of the TA will be improved cross-border links for economic corridors linking PNG and \nTimor-Leste with Indonesia through establishment of efficient systems of border crossings. The \noutcome will be measured by the volume of people and vehicles, and value and volume of trade \nin goods and services along the borders between PNG and Indonesia and between Timor-Leste \nand Indonesia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA, covering PNG and Timor-Leste, will strengthen the capacity of the border \nmanagement,  trade  and  tourism,  and  infrastructure  agencies  to  create  a  further  enabling \nenvironment for enhancing the economic corridors between PNG and Indonesia and between \n                                                 \n11  The International Organization for Migration is assisting the BOCC. \n1T2 h Teh evsieew asre e: x(ip) rAeDsBs.e 2d0 h0e9.r eRinep aorret  atnhdo sRee coof mthmee cnodnatsiounlt aonf tth aen Pdr edsoid neontt  tnoe tchees Bsoaarirldy  oref pDrireescetonrts :t hPorosepo osfe dA DAsBia\u2019sn  \nmDemevbeelorpsm, Benota Frdu nodf  DGirraenct totor st,h eM aDneamgoecmraeticn tR, oepr usbtalicff ,o af nTdim mora-Lye bsete p froer litmhein Raorya din N neatwtuorrek.

The capacity enhancement will cover participation in seminars, \nworkshops, and conferences to familiarize with and adopt international best practices in CIQS. \nProvision  of  geographic  information  system  (GIS),  geographic  positioning  system  (GPS), \nmapping and audiovisual equipment, as well as computing equipment (both hardware and \nsoftware) will be necessary to establish baseline and information resources to identify trade \nflows  and  assess  the  commodity  profiles,  market  information,  and  trade  benefits.13 The \nproposed TA will also link up with the activities in Indonesia under the ADB TA for Institutional \nDevelopment for Enhanced Subregional Cooperation in the aSEA [archipelagic Southeast Asia] \nRegion,  which  is  supporting  Indonesia.14 Under  the  regional  capacity  development  TA,  an \nextensive survey of tradable goods and services will be conducted, and the potential for cross-\nborder trade in the Pacific subregion examined. The regional TA will have three main outputs. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Enhanced  institutional  capacity  for  border  management  and  border \nservices.  This  will  (i)  develop  an  institutional  framework  and  capacity  building  plan  for \nintegrated border development, border management, and border services; (ii) strengthen the \ncapacity of the border services agencies to provide efficient and quality border services and \ntransit facilities; and (iii) establish an internal coordination mechanism involving line ministries \nand administration in the border provinces for providing necessary support to the JMC led by \nministries of foreign affairs in both countries. \n \n11.  Output 2: Strengthened cross-border trade and tourism links. This will (i) examine \nthe potential for cross-border trade in goods and services between Timor-Leste and Indonesia \nand between PNG and Indonesia, including assessment of benefits from forward and backward \nlinks of cross-border trade; (ii) strengthen trade-related institutions, including preparation of a \nblueprint for harmonizing transport, trade, tourism, and tariff policies for fostering private sector \ngrowth to increase trade and tourism flows; and (iii) assist in making border markets and border \npass agreements with Indonesia operational, including developing and/or improving systems for \nestablishing regulated border markets. \n \n12.  Output 3: Strengthened capacity for developing and implementing cross-border \ntransport links. Under this output, the TA will assist government agencies to (i) develop cross-\nborder transit and transport policies, and transit and transport agreements; and (ii) prepare an \ninvestment plan for cross-border transport and trade infrastructure and facilities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.7 million equivalent, of which (i) $1.5 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan; and \n(ii) $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility.15 The PNG \nand  Timor-Leste  governments  will  each  finance  equally  $0.2  million  equivalent  for  in-kind \nexpenses. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n13 The TA will collaborate with the CIQS project in the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines (BIMP)\u2013East \nASEAN  Growth  Area  (EAGA)  region  under  SERD  (TA  No.  6408-REG:  Support  for  Customs,  Immigration, \nQuarantine, and Security Harmonization in the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines\u2013East \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN) Growth Area). TA No. 6408-REG is expected to be completed in \nmid-2010.

In PNG, the BDA in conjunction with the Ministry of \nTrade and Commerce, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Commission on Customs, Department of \nImmigration, and provincial administration of the relevant border provinces will be responsible \nfor the implementation of the TA. In Timor-Leste, the BOCC, under the guidance of the Prime \nMinister's Office and Ministry of Finance, will coordinate the implementation of the TA, while the \nBOCC; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Tourism, Commerce and Industries; Ministry of \nInfrastructure; and Autonomous Region of Oecussi will participate in the implementation of the \nTA activities. In Timor-Leste, the TA team will also work closely with the MOFA to support the \nJMC activities.16 The participating agencies will assign necessary counterpart staff, and provide \noffice space to the TA consultants. The TA will be implemented over a period of 2 years starting \non 1 April 2010 and ending on 31 March 2012.  \n \n15.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.17 The TA will require 42 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 90 person-months of national consulting services in PNG and Timor-\nLeste,  and  will  include  specialists  and  experts  in  (i)  integrated  border  management  and \ninstitutional development; (ii) border management information and training analysis; (iii) trade \nand  development  economics;  (iv)  trade  and  tourism  policy,  and  cross-border  market \ndevelopment;  (v)  transport  and  transit  facilitation;  (vi)  border  infrastructure  and  facilities \ndevelopment;  and  (vii)  dissemination  and  communication.  The  consultants  will  be  selected \nthrough  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  using  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  Consultant's \nselection will be done by ADB in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time).
