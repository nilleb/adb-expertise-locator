INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is in support of the regional \ncooperation strategy and program (RCSP) (2011\u20132013) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).1 The project preparatory TA was prepared at the request of \nthe participating governments of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nViet Nam through a reconnaissance mission in March 2009 and a TA fact-finding mission in \nAugust\u2013September 2009. The project preparatory TA has the concurrence of the participating \ngovernments which have endorsed the proposed impacts, outcome, and outputs of the ensuing \ninvestment project, the proposed implementation and financing arrangements, and the terms of \nreference for the consultants. The concept paper was approved on 9 August 2010.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The RCSP for the GMS aims to help achieve the GMS vision of a prosperous, integrated, \nand harmonious subregion through the pursuit of four strategic pillars: (i) strengthening connectivity \nand facilitating cross-border movement and tourism; (ii) integrating national markets to promote \neconomic  efficiency  and  private  sector  development;  (iii)  addressing  health  and  other  social, \neconomic, and capacity building issues; and (iv) managing the environment and shared natural \nresources to help ensure sustainable development and conservation of natural resources. The \nproposed assistance is consistent with the strategic pillars of the current RCSP, specifically with \nregard  to  improving  health  and  poverty  levels  and mitigating  environmental  degradation. The \nproject will contribute to the implementation of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 for regional cooperation and \nintegration, and accelerate the economic integration of Association of Southeast Asian Nations.3 \n \n3.  The focus on corridor town development is a new approach to maximize the economic \nbenefits of increased trade and traffic flows along the major transport corridors in the GMS. Several \ncorridor towns are located so strategically that they can boost investment and economic activity. With \nthe necessary enabling environment in place\u2014such as proper strategic economic development plans, \nadequate infrastructure and public services, and institutional capacity to guide and manage future \ndevelopment  and  investment\u2014corridor  towns  can  also  successfully  attract  private  sector \ninvestments  for  economic  infrastructure  such  as  market  centers,  agro-business,  agricultural \nprocessing zones, industrial parks, transport terminals, and logistics facilities. These corridor towns \ncan play an important role for a cluster of settlements in their respective hinterlands. \n \n4.  The challenges facing many corridor towns in the GMS are significant. Some towns are \nsimply unable to cope with the rapid growth of migrants seeking new employment opportunities, \nand find their infrastructure and public services totally inadequate. Severe environmental problems \ndue to capacity constraints in water supply, sanitation systems, and solid-waste management are \ncommon,  and  increasing.  Furthermore,  the  absence  of  land  use  planning  and  regulations  is \ncontributing to increased congestion and haphazard development. Decisions on the location of \nindustrial  activities,  for  example,  are  often  made  in  the  absence  of  environmental  impact \nassessments and rigorous site selection criteria. As traffic and trade increases along the GMS \ntransport corridors, there is an urgent need to strengthen the capacities of towns to manage \ndevelopment in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. The planned development of \nthese towns will induce further regulated growth in their surrounding areas and strengthen the \neconomic vitality and investment attractiveness of the corridors. \n \n5.  The Southern Economic Corridor (SEC) and the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2   \nprovide the starting point for defining the geographic focus for the proposed project. Selection of \nthe corridor towns was based on various criteria, including (i) economic potential as border towns, \nindustrial  hubs,  market  centers,  transshipment  points,  and/or  their  tourism  attributes;  (ii) \ninfrastructure constraints on accommodating future growth and/or attracting private investment; \nand  (iii)  expressed  interest  and  commitment  to  dedicate  the  necessary  resources  towards \nsustainable economic growth and development. The proposed project will cover 10 towns along \nthe EWEC and SEC\u2014five border towns and five corridor towns. The infrastructure in the selected \ntowns is insufficient to service the increasing populations and foster trade, private investment and \nlocal economic development. There are four towns in Cambodia (Battambang, Bavet, Neak Leung, \nand Poipet), three in the Lao PDR (Dansavanh, Kaysone Phomvihane, and Phine), and three in \nViet Nam (Dong Ha, Lao Bao, and Moc Bai). The towns are economically diverse, with primary \nindustries that include agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and/or tourism. The towns of Kaysone \nPhomvihane  and  Battambang  have  the  largest  populations  (both  in  excess  of  100,000);  the \nremaining towns generally have populations of less than 50,000. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The project preparatory TA is required to establish the basis for the proposed investments \nand capacity development activities. It is designed to facilitate the transformation of the GMS \ntransport corridors into fully fledged economic corridors through priority infrastructure investments \nand capacity building support in selected corridor towns (including border towns). \n \n7.  The GMS  program  has  placed  considerable  emphasis  on  developing  priority transport \ncorridors in order to link countries together and to promote trade, tourism, and investment in the \nsubregion. Investments in roads and bridges have established and strengthened physical links \nthroughout the GMS and provided the foundation for more efficient transport of goods and people. \nTaking the development process one step further requires the transformation of these transport \ncorridors into fully fledged economic corridors. In contrast to transport corridors, economic corridors \nattract investments which, in turn, promote economic growth and development along the corridors. \nWhile border areas are often the most visible places of increased economic activity, villages, towns, \nand cities located along the corridors can also attract new investments if the necessary incentives \nand enabling conditions are in place. The availability of basic infrastructure and public services, for \nexample, is a necessary but not sufficient precondition for investment and sustainable economic \ndevelopment;  regulatory  frameworks  and  commitment  are  complementary  requirements.  This \ndevelopment strategy of transforming transport corridors into fully fledged economic corridors has \ngained momentum and was highlighted as a priority initiative at the 15th Ministerial Meeting of the \nGMS Economic Cooperation Program.4 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  Based  on  the  design  and  monitoring framework  (Appendix  1),  the  impact  will  be  that \ncorridor  towns  have  adequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  thereby  contributing  to  the \neconomic transformation of transport corridors in the GMS. The outcome of the TA is the agreed \ndesign of the resulting project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  For each of the corridor towns included in the project preparatory TA, the principal outputs \nare: (i) a strategic local economic development plan, (ii) an infrastructure investment program for \n                                                \n4  The 15th Ministerial Meeting of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program was held in Cha Am, Thailand on 17\u201319 \nJune 2009. \n ", "  3 \npriority urban infrastructure, and (iii) clearly defined institutional arrangements and the necessary \ncapacities to implement the strategic development plan and infrastructure investment program. \nThese three outputs are also essential for the corridor towns to attract private investment and to \nensure the sustainable management of future development opportunities as well as challenges. \nThe project preparatory TA, as also shown in the Design and Monitoring Framework will be \nstructured along the following three major outputs: \n \n10.  Output 1: Strategic local economic development plans. This output will provide the \nnecessary analytical and advisory services to prepare strategic local economic development plans \nin each of the participating corridor towns. Assessments will be undertaken of each corridor town's \ncurrent economic base by identifying core industries and services, and  then analyzing future \ndevelopment opportunities and constraints that take into account predicted growth in population, \ntraffic, and investment, along with needed institutional and policy reforms to ensure sound urban \nmanagement. The plans will identify suitable areas for new development of different land uses, \nincluding  commercial,  residential,  industrial,  and  agricultural  activities,  as  well  as  indicate \nenvironmentally sensitive areas for protection. In addition, to help guide future development, the \nplans will also identify possible clusters of economic development, and assist the corridor towns \ndetermine the types of economic activities that can be promoted for private sector investment. The \nparticipatory nature of preparation of these strategic local economic development plans provides \nsupport to the project implementation units; they will have a key role to play. \n \n11.  Output 2: Develop investment programs for priority urban infrastructure. The planning \nprocess will serve as the basis for identifying infrastructure constraints and deficiencies in the \ncorridor towns and prioritizing an investment program. Strategic investments under the ensuing \nproject will consist of basic urban infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation (including \nwastewater treatment), drainage, access roads and bridges, solid-waste management, and public \nmarkets and transport terminals. While investments in essential urban infrastructure are necessary \nto  accommodate  future  growth  and  development,  these  investments  can  also  catalyze  new \ninvestments.  In  this  context,  consideration  will  also  be  given  to  leveraging  infrastructure \ninvestments by the public sector to attract private sector investments in, for example, industrial \nparks, agro-industrial development zones, logistics centers, and cross-border facilities. Additionally, \ninfrastructure that can be financed through public\u2013private partnerships will also be identified. The \ninvestment program will be supplemented by safeguards studies of impacts on the environment, \nresettlement, and indigenous people. Initial environmental examinations will be carried out during \nthe project preparatory TA, but no significant environmental impacts are expected. Preliminary \nanalysis based on existing data indicates no land acquisition and involuntarily resettlement will be \nrequired for subprojects. An indigenous peoples development plan will be developed (if required) \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n12.  Output  3:  Strengthen  institutional  capacities  for  project  implementation  and \nsustainable  development.  In  addition  to  strategic  development  plans  and  infrastructure \ninvestment programs, the emergence of fully fledged economic corridors requires that towns have \nthe institutional capacities to manage development as well as promote investment opportunities to \nthe  private  sector.  Capacity  building  assistance  will  support  the  preparation  of  strategic  local \neconomic  development  plans,  and  implementation  of  infrastructure  investments.  The  capacity \ndevelopment output will contribute to the fine-tuning of implementation arrangements. Since private \nsector investments are the lifeblood of dynamic economic corridors, innovative means to attract \nprivate sector investments and to structure public\u2013private partnerships will be a critical area for \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building in the corridor towns.  \n \n13.  Under the project preparatory TA, technical due diligence will prepare detailed designs for \nprioritized  subprojects  and  identify  subsequent  batches  of  subprojects  to  be  prepared  during \n ", "4   \nproject implementation. The project will be a project loan. The due diligence will also cover (i) an \nassessment of economic internal rates of return and financial internal rate of return for all subprojects; \n(ii) a financial management assessment of all executive agencies to confirm capacity to manage \nthe  project  finances;  (iii)  development  of  procurement  plan  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate); and (iv) conduct of poverty, social, and gender analysis and preparation of a poverty and a \nsocial strategy, a gender action plan, and a participation strategy. Initial safeguard screening will \ncover the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people, as indicated in the initial \npoverty and social analysis (Appendix 2). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The estimated cost of this project preparatory TA is $2.3 million equivalent, of which $0.8 \nmillion will be financed from ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $1.2 million by \nthe Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility of ADB. The governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam \nwill finance the remaining $0.3 million equivalent. The governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam have been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The project preparatory TA will be implemented by three executing agencies: the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport in Cambodia in collaboration with the newly created provincial councils, \nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport in the Lao PDR, and the provincial governments (such \nas the provincial people's committee of Quang Tri Province) in Viet Nam. The three participating \nexecuting agencies will form country steering committees that will provide overall guidance at the \nnational level, and coordinate the Corridor Towns Development Project (CTDP) implementation \nissues with peer country steering committees. The implementing agencies will be the participating \ntowns,  which  will  establish  project  implementation  units  in  their  public  works  departments \n(Cambodia and Viet Nam) and the Urban Development Administration Authorities (the Lao PDR). \nThe  preparation  of  the  project,  and  particularly  the  formulation  of  strategic  local  economic \ndevelopment  plans,  will  be  participatory  in  nature  and  include  public  and  private  sector \nstakeholders. The TA will be implemented over eight months starting January 2011. \n \n16.  The TA for the preparation of the GMS CTDP will require about 130 person-months of \nconsulting services, consisting of 30 person-months of international services and 100 person-\nmonths of national services, as elaborated in the outline of terms of reference for consultants \n(Appendix 4). The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be engaged using \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality cost ratio of 80:20. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for the Greater Mekong Subregion: \nPreparing the Corridor Towns Development Project. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nCorridor towns have  Water, solid, and air pollution  Benchmarking data (at  The governments remain \nadequate urban  levels reduced by 40%, 2012\u2013 project preparatory TA  committed to the urban \ninfrastructure and  2018   time)  infrastructure sector as a \nservices.      national development priority. \nLivability of towns and public  National statistics   \nhealth: incidence of    Government and private \nenvironment-related diseases  Annual socioeconomic  sector can agree on joint \nreduced by 40%, 2012\u20132018  surveys  PPP initiatives. \n   \nGender equity in economic  Risk \nopportunities: 40% female  Regulatory frameworks of the \nparticipation in economic  GMS governments do not \nactivities, 2012\u20132018  fully support the project \ndesign.  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAgreed design of the  Project design, including  SPARs  The governments remain \nresulting project  approvals of the following  RRP  committed to the urban \ndocuments by ADB and the  PAM  infrastructure sector as a \nparticipating governments:   tender materials  national development priority. \nSPARs   \nRRP  Government and private \nPAM  sector can agree on joint \ntender materials  PPP initiatives. \n \nRisk \nRegulatory frameworks of the \nGMS governments do not \nfully support the project \ndesign.  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n  Poverty in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is still substantial in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam, where its incidence ranges from 9% to 34% of the population. Through the \ndevelopment of economic corridors in the GMS, new opportunities will be created following the development of \nexisting and new towns along those corridors (particularly the East\u2013West and Southern corridors) and at the \nborders of the GMS countries.  \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n   General Intervention     Individual or Household (TI-H) \n   Geographic (TI-G)      Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n  The interventions are nationwide. The project will contribute to poverty reduction indirectly through developing \nurban areas, development of human capital and human development, public governance.  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (TA)/due diligence? \n  Among the national consultants, there are the following specialists who will deal with poverty analysis and due \ndiligence, among other things: (i) social preparation and community development specialists (15 person-months), \n(ii) resettlement specialists (15 person-months), (iii) water and sanitation engineers (15 person-months), and (iv) \nflood control and drainage engineers (15 person-months). \n \n3.  If general intervention, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, \ncross subsidy, pro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \n  The proposed project will pursue the following outcomes: (i) increased access by citizens and economic \nenterprises to basic public infrastructure (and also improved urban/public service provision); (ii) enhanced local \neconomic development through infrastructure facilities, and increased employment and income opportunities; \n(iii) improved financing facilities of infrastructure investments, including public\u2013private partnerships in financing and \nimplementing basic urban services programs; (iv) addressing of climate change through investments in solid-waste \nmanagement and sewerage, both of which are emitters of greenhouse gases; and (v) improved local government \ncapacities and empowered local institutions and organizations (including enhanced urban management capacity). \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n  The potential beneficiaries are residents and businesses operating in the selected towns. The poor and \nsocially excluded are expected to benefit from new job opportunities and increased local economic activities. They \nwill benefit from the improved access to urban services, both improving their physical environment and health and \ntheir business operations and competitiveness. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n  The needs of beneficiaries related to stable and adequately paid employment and improved access to basic \nurban infrastructure. The project will directly contribute to: (i) reduced infrastructure backlogs, (ii) increased \neconomic productivity of targeted towns, and (iii) improved income and employment opportunities of the affected \npopulation. Thus, in terms of benefits, the poor shall directly benefit from improved urban services, and indirectly \nbenefit from improved employment opportunities and increase productivity of their towns. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n  Some of the economically active population of these towns is expected to settle in the closer physical range of \nthe border towns, possibly in informal settlements. To mitigate the proliferation  of informal settlements  and slums, \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nit is proposed to invest in these border towns in guided land development to accommodate new residents and to \nsteer urban development \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n  Local government units, private sector companies, and communities as beneficiaries of urban services. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation is required during the project preparatory TA or project processing \n(e.g., workshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n  Consultation of communities regarding specific services which have a direct impact on their lives (water \nsupply, sanitation, solid waste, etc.) will be undertaken during subproject preparation. This will focus on technical \nissues and the willingness and ability to pay for these services. Consultation and participation will be applied in \ncase of resettlement. Beneficiaries, local private sector representatives, nongovernment organizations, and local \nauthorities will be involved in all stages of program implementation to ensure its sustainability. The risk of \nspeculators or developers buying land from the community is a social risk that can be mitigated through a public \ninformation campaign to ensure that people are aware of the project benefits as well as the potential risks and \nconsequences of being bought out by speculators or developers. Additionally, if specific areas or zones are \nearmarked for development under the project, it is possible to require that ADB safeguard policies apply to \ndevelopment projects in these areas, and supersede the national laws if there are differences. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n    Information sharing        Consultation \n    Collaborative decision making      Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes            No    Please explain. \n  Subproject planning and design will entail intensive qualitative analysis directly involving project beneficiaries \nthrough the extensive use of participatory methods to identify the local poor population and the infrastructure \nprovisions  that  may  better  fit  their  needs.  Multistakeholder  workshops  will  be  held  to  discuss  subproject \nformulation and implementation, and additional community consultations will be held following the approval of the \nsubprojects. A consultation and participation plan will be prepared for cases of resettlement made necessary by \ncivil works. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n  Women will be fully represented in subproject design to ensure that infrastructure provisions reflect women\u2019s \nneeds. Particular attention to women will be also given in the location of infrastructure facilities (water, sanitation, \nsolid-waste management, markets). Health and income-generation benefits of the proposed project will reflect \nwomen\u2019s needs. Women will have equal participation in local economic development activities. \n \n2.

Justification \n \n1.  The regional cooperation strategy and program for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \n(2009\u20132011) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)1 aims to help achieve the GMS vision of a \nprosperous, integrated, and harmonious subregion through the pursuit of four strategic pillars: \n(i) strengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-border movement and tourism; (ii) integrating \nnational  markets  to  promote  economic  efficiency  and  private  sector  development; \n(iii)  addressing  health  and  other  social,  economic,  and  capacity  building  issues;  and \n(iv)  managing  the  environment  and  shared  natural  resources  to  help  ensure  sustainable \ndevelopment and conservation of natural resources.2 The proposed assistance is consistent \nwith the strategic pillars of the current regional cooperation strategy and program, specifically \nregarding improving health and poverty levels, and mitigating environmental degradation. The \nproject will contribute to the implementation of Strategy 20203 for regional cooperation and \nintegration, and accelerate Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic integration, which \ncovers  five  areas:  (i)  developing  investment  projects,  including  infrastructure  to  support \ntransport networks, trade logistics, and modernization of agriculture; (ii) enhancing support for \ncommunity-based  ecotourism  development;  (iii)  hastening  implementation  of  projects  that \nadvance  the  environmental  management  and  climate  change  agenda;  (iv)  strengthening \nrelationships  with  local  governments  and  the  private  sector;  and  (v)  intensifying  capacity \ndevelopment.4 \n \n2.  The GMS countries pursue a joint strategy to convert their recently created transport \ncorridors  into  fully  fledged  economic  corridors,  as  has  been  stressed  by  the  recent  15th \nMinisterial  Meeting  of  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program  (17\u201319  June  2009).  To \nenhance economic growth and productivity in the economic corridors, border towns and new \nurban  growth  centers  need  effective  management  through  integrated  development  of \ninfrastructure and planned and systematic project, policy, and institutional interventions. The \nproposed project will trigger a number of subregional projects and generate synergy with other \nongoing  initiatives  of government  and  ADB-supported  programs  as  well  as  those  of  other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n3.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  as  also  shown  in  the  Design  and \nMonitoring Framework, will be structured along the following three major outputs: Output 1: \nStrategic local economic development plans; Output 2: Develop investment programs for priority \nurban infrastructure; Output 3: Strengthen institutional capacities for project implementation and \nsustainable development. \n \n4.
