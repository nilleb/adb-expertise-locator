THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the additional financing of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Health Security Project.1  \n \n2.  The original project is helping Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), Myanmar, and Viet Nam comply with the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the \nrequirement to develop core health system capacities to respond to public health threats of \nnational  and  international  concern.2 Project  investments  support  three  outputs:  (i) regional \ncooperation and communicable disease control in border areas improved, (ii) national disease \nsurveillance  and  outbreak  response  system  strengthened,  and  (iii)  laboratory  services  and \nhospital infection prevention and control (IPC) improved. In Myanmar, the original project is being \nimplemented  with  the  National  Health  Laboratory  and  in  13  state,  regional,  and  township \nhospitals. The proposed additional financing will support implementation of the government\u2019s \nHealth Sector Contingency Plan (HSCP) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19).3 The additional \nfinancing  will  provide  targeted  investment  for  31  district  and  township  hospitals  requiring \nimmediate upgrading of clinical care, IPC, and human resource capacity to respond to COVID-19 \nand other future public health threats.4 The additional financing will complement ADB\u2019s support \nunder  the  COVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  (CARES)  Program.5 The \nadditional financing project remains aligned with the outcome of the original project: Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) health system performance with regard to health security improved. \nThe report and recommendation of the President for the original project is accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 22 November 2016, \nfor a total of $125 million equivalent to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (footnote \n1). On 22 May 2020, additional financing of $20 million was approved for the Lao PDR to support \na new project output for emergency response to the COVID-19 outbreak (footnote 1). The project \n \n1  The original project comprises (i) loans to Cambodia (SDR15,012,000 [$21 million]), the Lao PDR (SDR2,856,000 \n[$4 million]), Myanmar ($12 million), and Viet Nam (SDR56,946,000 [$80 million]); and (ii) a grant to the Lao PDR \n($8 million). ADB provided a loan (additional financing) to the Lao PDR ($20 million). ADB also provided project \npreparatory technical assistance of $1.3 million to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam.

Geneva. \n4 Two of the 31 hospitals under the proposed additional financing project, Myawaddy District Hospital and Ye Township \nHospital, are also supported under the original project. Investments for these two hospitals under the original project \nand additional financing project are complementary. \n5  The CARES Program for Myanmar supports implementation of the government's COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan, \nincluding  investments  under  Goal  6:  Healthcare  Systems  Strengthening.  ADB.  Myanmar:  COVID-19  Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program. \n ", " \n2 \ncompletion date is 31 March 2022, and the loan closing date is 30 September 2022. As of 2 \nSeptember 2020, against the elapsed project time of 65.0%, implementation of the original project \nin Myanmar was on track. Cumulative contract awards for Myanmar are $3.7 million (31.1% of \nADB financing) and disbursements $4.6 million (38.8%, including advances of $1.3 million). Of \nthe 10 outcome and output indicators for Myanmar, 5 have already been achieved, 4 are partially \nachieved, and 1 has yet to start. The delivery of expected outputs is rated successful. Project \ncovenants, including all safeguard covenants, are either complied with or are being complied with. \nThe identified project implementation risks have been adequately mitigated and the management \nof risks is rated successful.  \n \n4.  The Government of Myanmar has requested $30 million for the proposed additional \nfinancing to strengthen preparedness and response capacity of the health system for COVID-19.6 \nAs of 18 September 2020, Myanmar reported 4,299 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 68 \ndeaths.7 Of the confirmed cases, 3,995 are linked to local transmission, with clusters in Rakhine \nState, Yangon and Mandalay.8 Myanmar remains highly vulnerable to a surge in case numbers. \nThe country\u2019s high number of returning migrants from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, \nand other neighboring countries, increases the risk for imported COVID-19 cases.9 Poor and \ncrowded living conditions in urban and peri-urban areas, with inadequate water and sanitation \ninfrastructure, create the conditions for local transmission and the potential for spread of COVID-\n19 in the country. The high prevalence of communicable and chronic illnesses that compromise \nimmune and respiratory system functioning increases the risk of comorbidity and more severe \nclinical progression of COVID-19.10 While the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) has scaled \nup the country\u2019s testing capacity, the number of tests performed remains the lowest in Southeast \nAsia at 3,906 per million population.11 \n \n5.  The MOHS and the World Health Organization (WHO) assess Myanmar\u2019s preparedness \ncapacity for responding to COVID-19 at less than 60%, with the greatest weakness at the \nsubnational level.12 Investment is needed immediately in district and township hospitals,13 which \nare pivotal in the assessment, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19 cases, particularly in remote \nand border areas (footnote 3). District and township hospitals face constraints in three key areas: \n(i) emergency departments and clinical wards lack facilities for separation of infectious patients \nas well as equipment for diagnosis and clinical management of severe respiratory diseases and \ncomorbidities; (ii) systems for IPC and the management of infectious medical waste are weak and \nsupplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) inadequate, increasing the risk of COVID-19 \namong health sector staff, patients, and the community; and (iii) health staff, 75% of whom are \n \n6  The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. \nAs of 18 September 2020, COVID-19 had spread to 188 countries, with over 30.1 million confirmed cases and \n946,158 deaths.

These hospitals are \nprioritized for investment under the HSCP.  \n \n ", " \n3 \nfemale, lack the requisite knowledge for assessment and clinical management of COVID-19, IPC, \nand psychosocial care for patients.14 Strengthening capacity of medical care services, IPC, and \nhuman resources in district and township hospitals is prioritized under the HSCP.15  \n \n6.  The proposed additional financing to the health security project is an efficient modality for \nthe expedited delivery of support to district and township hospitals under MOHS\u2019s COVID-19 \nresponse (footnote 3). The approach leverages the experience of MOHS with ADB project \nadministration and its capacity to deliver activities with township and district hospitals. Channeling \nsupport as additional financing to the health security project ensures synergies between targeted \ninvestment to combat COVID-19 and ongoing efforts to strengthen preparedness and capacity to \nrespond to public health threats. The proposed additional financing has been determined to be \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. The project meets the criteria for \nCOVID-19 fast-track processing.16 \n \n7.  The project is aligned with the government\u2019s strong commitment to regional health security \nand achievement of the IHR core capacities (footnote 2). The project is consistent with the ADB \nStrategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priorities  (OPs)  to  (i)  address  remaining  poverty  and  reduce \ninequalities by achieving better health for all (OP1); (ii) accelerate progress in gender equality in \nhuman development (OP2); and (iii) foster regional cooperation and integration, including the \npromotion of regional public goods to mitigate cross-border risks of communicable disease \n(OP7).17 The project remains aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u2013\n2021,  which  prioritizes  advancing  regional  public  health  to  reduce  constraints  to  inclusive \ndevelopment.18 The project contributes to the collective goal of the GMS countries to improve the \nGMS health system response to acute public health threats.19 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n8.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  GMS  public  health  security \nstrengthened.20 The project will have the following outcome: GMS health system performance \nwith  regard  to  health  security  improved.21The  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  remain \nunchanged from the original project. The additional financing will help Myanmar comply with the \nrequirements of the IHR and WHO\u2019s Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, in line with the \noriginal project outcome indicators.22 The project expands the scope of the original project to \nencompass investment to strengthen preparedness for responding to COVID-19 in 31 district and \n \n14 This includes capacity to respond to persons affected by gender-based violence. The incidence of such violence has \nincreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring health workers\u2019 capacity to provide psychosocial support to \naffected persons is a priority.

Target hospitals are in areas that are highly vulnerable because of \npoverty, ethnicity, and inadequate access to essential services, including health care.23  \n \n9.  Activities under the additional financing will be consolidated and delivered through output \n4, which is aligned with and contributes to the original project outcome. Output 4 will be rephrased \nas \u201cemergency preparedness and response capacity for COVID-19 strengthened,\u201d which will fully \ncapture the objectives of the additional financing. In line with the HSCP, activities under output 4 \nwill strengthen capacity across three core areas of district and township hospital service delivery \n(para. 5): (i) clinical management and medical care services, (ii) IPC at the project hospitals, and \n(iii) human resources. \n \n10.  Clinical management and medical care services. Emergency departments, isolation \nwards, hospital laboratories, and medical and high-dependency care units will be provided with \nequipment to support the assessment, isolation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and \nassociated comorbidities. Small-scale refurbishment works will be carried out to enable the \ninstallation and operation of hospital equipment, including equipment to supply oxygen, electricity, \nwater, and other essential inputs. The mix of equipment and scope of works for each hospital will \nbe determined through individual assessments. \n \n11.  Hospital infection prevention and control. Small-scale works will prepare hospital \nwards for the separation and isolation of infectious patients and provide separate facilities for \nfemale and male patients and staff members. Autoclaves, microwave incinerators, and liquid \nwaste treatment tanks will be installed in selected hospitals, improving their management of solid \nand liquid infectious waste. The PPE, in appropriate sizes, will be provided for female and male \nhospital staff members. \n \n12.  Human resources. Female and male hospital staff members will receive training on \nassessment of patients with respiratory infections, IPC, laboratory, and clinical management for \nCOVID-19 and associated comorbidities. Female and male hospital staff members will receive \ntraining on the detection of gender-based violence (GBV) and associated referral options through \nan ongoing regional technical assistance project.24 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n13.  Since  ADB  reengaged  with  Myanmar  in  2012,  its  health  sector  investments  have \nsupported health security initiatives linked to regional cooperation and integration (footnote 1) and \nHIV prevention.25 These investments, which focus on strengthening core public health system \ncapacities, particularly in cross-border areas, build on ADB\u2019s value addition as a trusted partner \nin regional health cooperation in the GMS. Achievements from this engagement highlight ADB\u2019s \ncomparative advantage in delivering targeted support at the regional, township and community \nlevels. ADB has leveraged this advantage in its support to the government\u2019s response to COVID-\n19. Initial reprogramming of $6.6 million under the ongoing health security project will address  \nimmediate  subnational  needs  for  laboratory  diagnostics,  emergency  care  equipment,  and \nconsumables. The proposed additional financing project will complement this investment by \nextending support for the COVID-19 response to additional district and township hospitals. \nRecognizing that resources are limited, ADB is coordinating closely with other development \n \n23 The MOHS has identified more than 100 hospitals requiring upgrading to respond to COVID-19. Hospitals that are \naccessible to ethnic populations and to populations in hard-to-reach and border areas were prioritized.  \n24 ADB Enhancing Gender Equality Results in Southeast Asian Developing Member Countries (Phase 2). \n25 ADB.

The World Bank will provide a $50 million loan and $8 million grant under the \nMyanmar COVID-19 Emergency Response Project, which will support investment for 61 state, \nand district hospitals in locations not supported by the proposed ADB additional financing.26  \n \n14.  ADB synergizes investments in the health sector to maximize cumulative impacts. The \nadditional financing project will complement ADB\u2019s CARES Program to Myanmar, which supports \nimplementation  of  the  government\u2019s  COVID-19  Economic  Relief  Plan  (CERP),  including \ninvestment to strengthen health systems. 27  The additional financing is aligned with ongoing \nassistance to the MOHS under ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance (TA) projects.28 Under ADB\u2019s \nwider health sector portfolio, the proposed Improving Noncommunicable Diseases Prevention \nand Treatment Project will enhance capacity of prevention and treatment services for non-\ncommunicable diseases.29 Recognizing ADB\u2019s synergistic approach as a comparative advantage, \nthe government has requested ADB for TA to (i) undertake a diagnostic study of health sector \nsystems for public financial management to determine the required reforms and the sustainability \nof health sector investments; and (ii) prepare a national hospital plan to guide medium-term \ninvestment in hospital development across the country.30  \n \n15.  ADB applies a conflict-sensitive approach to all its operations in Myanmar.31  Conflict-\nsensitive design features of the project include (i) strengthening project management unit (PMU) \nstaff  and  consultants\u2019  understanding  of  ethnic  and  cultural  differences  in  a  post-conflict \nenvironment through training on conflict sensitivity, (ii) ensuring that information about the project \nand  its  benefits  is  translated  into  local  languages  and  accessible  to  all  communities, \n(iii) implementing an ethnic group development plan to maximize the project\u2019s positive benefits \nfor all ethnic communities, (iv) ensuring that the most vulnerable populations have access to \ncritical health services through coordination between the MOHS and civil society organizations \nand  ethnic  health  organizations,  and  (v)  periodically  reviewing  project  implementation  to \ndetermine additional mitigation measures that may be required.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The overall project for the four countries is estimated to cost $186.0 million (Table 1), \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  charges  during \nimplementation. In Myanmar, the original project is estimated to cost $12.8 million and the \nadditional financing project $32.2 million.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n18.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. With the additional financing, ADB will support \nexpenditures for procurement and installation of equipment for medical wards, laboratories, waste \nmanagement, IPC, and utilities in 31 district and township hospitals. ADB will also finance minor \nrenovation works in each hospital, consulting support, training, operation and maintenance cost, \ncontingencies (physical and price), and interest during implementation.  \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nCurrenta  Additional Financing  Total \nAmount   Share of  Amount   Share of  Amount   Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%) \n           \nAsian Development Bank  \nOCR (concessional loans)             \n  Cambodia  21.0  15.9  0.0  0.0  21.0  11.3 \n  Myanmar  12.0  9.1  30.0  55.8  42.0  22.6 \n  Viet Nam  80.0  60.5  0.0  0.0  80.0  43.0 \n  Lao PDR  4.0  3.0  20.0  37.2  24.0  12.9 \nADF Grant\u2014Lao PDR  8.0  6.1  0.0  0.0  8.0  4.3 \nGovernment of Cambodia  1.8  1.4  0.0  0.0  1.8  1.0 \n ", " \n7 \nCurrenta  Additional Financing  Total \nAmount   Share of  Amount   Share of  Amount   Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nGovernment of Myanmar  0.8  0.6      2.2  4.0  3.0  1.6 \nGovernment of Viet Nam  4.0  3.0  0.0  0.0  4.0  2.2 \nGovernment of the Lao PDR  0.6  0.5  1.6  3.0  2.2  1.2 \nTotal  132.2  100.0  53.8  100.0  186.0  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na Refers to the original loan, grant, and government financing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  As in the original project, the MOHS, through its Department of Medical Services (DOMS), \nwill be the executing agency for the additional financing. The director general of the DOMS will \nbe the project director. A new PMU will be established under the DOMS to support the project \ndirector in management, monitoring, and administration of the additional financing.33 The PMU \nwill be supported by 10 national consultants. The 31 district and township hospitals will act as \nimplementing agencies. The medical superintendents of each hospital will oversee the planning \nand implementation of project activities in their facilities.  \n \n20.  All procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). As procurement will support \nCOVID-19 response, universal procurement will apply (footnote 16).  Based on the capacity and \nperformance of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in undertaking similar \nactivities, the MOHS will engage UNOPS through direct contracting to supply all goods and \nrelated services, including minor civil works at selected hospitals. \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 32).  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 November 2020\u201331 October 2022  \nEstimated completion date  31 October 2022 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 April 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  MOHS project steering committee.

For the additional financing, the project activities will fall within the mandate of \nthe DOMS. To ensure effective project management, a new PMU will be established under the DOMS. \n ", " \n8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nConsulting services  ICS   166 person-months  $0.38 million  \nRetroactive financing   None \nAdvance contracting  Selection of individual consultants and engagement of UNOPS \nup to, but not including, contract signature. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOMS = Department of Medical Services, ICS = individual consultant selection, IPC \n= infection prevention and control, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, MOHS = Ministry of Health and Sports, UNOPS \n= United Nations Office for Project Services, WASH = water, sanitation, and hygiene. \na  The national gender specialist is financed through an ongoing regional technical assistance project.

Based on its guidelines on the essential equipment required by district and township \nhospitals to respond to COVID-19, the MOHS, in close collaboration with the target hospitals, has \nselected the equipment to be provided. These guidelines were developed in consultation with the \nWHO and are aligned with WHO\u2019s global guidelines. Detailed engineering assessments will be \nundertaken for each hospital to ensure that the requisite conditions and services are in place for \noptimum functioning of the equipment. The goods contracts for the installation of the medical \nequipment will include provisions for training hospital staff members on the use of equipment \nprocured under the project. The purchase of goods will prioritize those for which local agents are \npresent in Myanmar or elsewhere in the region, to facilitate after-sales services relating to spare \nparts, consumables provision, and associated support.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  The economic analysis was updated following 2017 ADB's Guidelines on Economic \nAnalysis (2017).34 The cost-effectiveness analysis conducted for the additional financing shows \nthat the cost per disability-adjusted life year is less than three times the gross domestic product  \nper  capita, making the  intervention  very  cost-effective.35 The  results are  robust  to  various \nsensitivity scenarios. The cost\u2013benefit analysis conducted for the original project was also \nupdated. An economic internal rate of return of 28.1% was estimated for the additional financing, \nhigher than the economic internal rate of return of the original project of 23.4% and above the \nminimum required threshold of 6.0% for social sector investments.36 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n24.  The financial analysis confirmed that the government has adequate budgetary resources \nto absorb any incremental recurrent costs arising from the additional financing project. The annual \nincremental cost as a percentage of the government\u2019s total health sector budget ranges from \n0.07% in FY2021 to 0.05% in FY2025. Although the economy grew at 6.8% in FY2019, ADB\u2019s \nestimation of the gross domestic product growth rate for FY2020 has been reduced to 1.8%, \n \n34 ADB. 2017.

The CERP comprises a mix of health, social, and economic measures, and will help \nstrengthen  the  health  care  system  and  increase  access  to  COVID-19  financing,  including \ncontingency  funds.  The  additional  financing  project  is  likely  to  be  sustainable  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s strong commitment to supporting the health sector. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The government continues to strengthen its public financial management (PFM) with \nsupport from development partners by reforming the PFM system to improve governance and \ntransparency.38 The first phase of the PFM system reform focused on (i) revenue and customs \nand budget planning, execution, and reporting at the Ministry of Planning Finance and Investment; \n(ii) support for the Office of the Auditor General; and (iii) the establishment of the PFM Academy \nto support government capacity building. The budget process has been improved significantly \nwith the introduction of the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. The PFM Academy provides training \ncourses for line ministries, developed with support from development partners, including the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).39 The government started the second phase (2018\u20132022) of \nits PFM reform strategy with various strengthening activities, including improving procurement \nlaw, internal audit capacity, and financial reporting systems.  \n \n26.  The project pre-mitigation financial management and procurement risks are substantial. \nThe additional financing will be implemented by the MOHS through the DOMS. The capacity of \nthe MOHS and the DOMS remains constrained, particularly given the complexity of the supply \nmarket for medical goods. Limited capacity in procurement and financial management might \nimpede emergency response activities. To mitigate these risks, UNOPS will be engaged to \nprovide procurement and related services, including for minor civil works. ADB will support the \nMOHS  in  the  recruitment  of  individual  consultants.  A  separate  advance  account  will  be \nestablished at the MOHS through the DOMS. ADB will disburse a substantial portion of the loan \nthrough direct payment arrangements to UNOPS. The Office of the Auditor General will conduct \nthe external audit of additional financing activities as part of the annual audit process for the \noverall project. With the mitigation measures, the financial management and procurement risk \nrating is moderate. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOHS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 32). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Poverty. The additional financing project is classified as a general intervention. The \nproject supports poverty reduction indirectly through investments to strengthen the capacity of \nhealth services to respond to and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Households are at high risk \nof  being  significantly  burdened  financially  by  COVID-19\u2013related  illness.  Global  evidence \n \n37 ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Supplement.

Social. The additional financing project will decrease communicable diseases. It will \ndirectly lower the risk of COVID-19 spread by strengthening hospital capacity to diagnose, isolate, \nand treat COVID-19 patients. These interventions will improve hospital capacity to respond to \nemerging disease threats. The MOHS, through its direct contract with UNOPS, will ensure that all \nworks contracts comply with national labor laws and do not involve (i) forced labor, (ii) child labor, \nand (iii) discrimination in the workplace. \n \n30.  Gender. The additional financing is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The \ngender action plan (GAP) for the original project has been updated to incorporate gender targets \nand actions for output 4. Myanmar\u2019s health workforce is highly feminized (75%): almost all nursing \nprofessionals and more than half of medical practitioners are female.43 However, a high proportion \nof female health workers are concentrated in lower-level technical and managerial positions. \nCOVID-19 exacerbate social issues linked to gender inequality, particularly the incidence of GBV. \nThe gender and social dimensions of the project are largely concerned with ensuring that (i) \nfacilities in the targeted hospitals guarantee appropriate privacy for female patients and staff \nmembers; (ii) female and male health workers have equal opportunity to participate in trainings \non COVID-19 clinical management, IPC, laboratory techniques; (iii) female and male health \nworkers have access to appropriately sized PPE; and (iv) female and male health workers have \nthe required knowledge and skills to provide support and referral options to persons affected by \nGBV. The PMU, with the support of a national gender specialist, will monitor GAP implementation. \nA knowledge, attitude, and perception survey will track improvements in health workers\u2019 response \nto GBV. Progress on GAP implementation will be included in all progress and monitoring and \nevaluation reports. Project data will be disaggregated by sex to the extent possible.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.44  \n \n32.  Environment (category C). The additional financing will not involve any major civil works \nor activities in environmentally sensitive areas. Each implementing agency will assign one \nqualified staff member to monitor and oversee minor renovation works and to establish COVID-\n19 risk management protocols for contractors and equipment suppliers. A national safeguard \nspecialist will support the PMU and the implementing agencies in setting up environment, health, \nand safety protocols, and will support the PMU in submitting quarterly project progress reports on \nthe project\u2019s performance in environmental health and safety. The original project remains \ncategory B for environment and the environmental management plan will continue to apply. \n \n40 World Bank. 2019.
