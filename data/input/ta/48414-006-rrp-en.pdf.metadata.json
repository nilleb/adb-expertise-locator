THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nCorridor 2 Karakalpakstan Road (A380 Kungrad to Daut-Ata Section) Project. \n \n2.  The project will upgrade and widen a section of the Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Beyneu \nhighway (A380) of about 240 kilometers (km) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The project road \nis part of the CAREC Corridor 2 and one of the key trade routes in the region. The project will \nhelp  the  Committee  for  Roads  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  to  ensure  effective  road \nmaintenance, control vehicle overloading, and ensure sound traffic management through the \ninstallation  of  intelligent  transport  system  (ITS)  and  weigh-in-motion  (WIM)  system  on  key \nsections  of  the  national  road  network.  The  project  will  scale  up  the  efforts  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other development partners in developing this critical CAREC \ncorridor and contribute to Uzbekistan\u2019s economic growth through improved transport connectivity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Importance of regional connectivity to Uzbekistan. Surrounded by Afghanistan to the \nsouth, Kazakhstan to the north and northwest, the Kyrgyz Republic to the northeast, Turkmenistan \nto the southwest, and Tajikistan to the southeast, Uzbekistan serves three of six CAREC \ncorridors. With 34 million people, Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia. As a \ndouble landlocked country, which requires crossing at least two countries to reach seaports, the \ngovernment has made regional connectivity a centerpiece of its transport policy. The government \naims to realize the great trade potential through developing the country into a regional transport \nand logistics hub between Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia. \n \n4.  Road network as a bedrock of regional connectivity. Uzbekistan\u2019s road network, under \nthe purview of the Committee for Roads, covers 185,000 km, with a core network of 42,654 km\u2014\ninternational roads (3,979 km), national roads (14,069 km), and regional roads (24,606 km). While \nUzbekistan is comparable with other countries in Central Asia in terms of the density of paved \nroads, the distribution of paved roads varies within the country.1 \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s and development partners\u2019 support to regional connectivity. The CAREC \nprogram provides Uzbekistan and its neighboring countries with a common platform to coordinate \ninvestments. ADB has invested in road and rail transport infrastructure in Uzbekistan, at a total \nvalue of $1.3 billion.2 The majority of this support has been provided through two multitranche \nfinancing facilities.3 \n6.  Modernization of CAREC Corridor 2 as a key priority. The east\u2013west trade corridor is \na key priority. A large part of these efforts focused on the strengthening of CAREC Corridor 2, \n \n1  Density is higher in the eastern regions (4,000 km\u20136,000 km per 10,000 square kilometers [km2] in Andijan, \nFerghana, Namangan, and Tashkent). To the south, density decreases to moderate values (1,000 km\u20133,000 km per \n10,000 km2) and is lowest in the western regions (less than 1,000 km per 10,000 km2 in Karakalpakstan and Navoi). \n2  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 4). \n3  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nwhich connects East Asia with the Caucasus, Mediterranean, and southern Europe, covering \nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China. The project is a crucial part of these efforts and will improve \nthe last road link to the international border with Kazakhstan, and thus help complete the \nmodernization of CAREC Corridor 2. The project thereby supports the implementation of CAREC \n2030,  particularly  operational  clusters  2  (trade,  tourism,  and  economic  corridors)  and  3 \n(infrastructure and economic connectivity).4 The project promotes the CAREC Transport Strategy \n2030, particularly the strategic pillars on (i) cross-border transport and logistics facilitation, by \nfacilitating the movement of cargo from Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States \n(CIS) countries; and (ii) road safety, by increasing the road safety management capacity of the \nCommittee for Roads and introducing a state-of-art ITS.5 The modernization of this key section of \nCAREC Corridor 2 will help boost Uzbekistan\u2019s trade, particularly with the Russian Federation \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China, Uzbekistan\u2019s two major trade partners. It will also enhance \nUzbekistan\u2019s role in transiting international goods and shipments by reducing transport costs and \ntime. In addition, it will facilitate economic corridor development among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, \nand Tajikistan, as the improved road will boost industrial and tourism activities.6 \n \n7.  Karakalpakstan, located at the northwestern end of Uzbekistan, is the country\u2019s largest \nregion, occupying about 35% of total land area. However, its population of 1.89 million (2019) \naccounts for only 5.6% of the country\u2019s total. Karakalpakstan is one of the two poorest regions of \nUzbekistan, suffering high levels of poverty, unemployment, and poor health conditions. The size \nand strategic geographical location of Karakalpakstan make transport connectivity a paramount \npriority, not only for Uzbekistan but also for the subregion. Karakalpakstan has about 700 km of \ninternational  roads,  two  international  airports,  and  a  railway  network  that  connects  with \nTurkmenistan and Kazakhstan. The Kungrad to Daut-Ata road is the only road connecting \nUzbekistan in a northwestern direction to the countries of the CIS and Europe, which is vital to \nlink the region with the CIS, particularly the Russian Federation, as well as with Europe. \n \n8.  Need for institutional reforms to be accelerated. The government, supported by ADB \nand other development partners, has carried out several policy and institutional reforms since \n2003, including (i) creating the Ministry of Transport as the apex agency responsible for transport \nsector planning, policy formulation, regulation, and oversight; (ii) transforming the joint stock \ncompany  Uzavtoyul  into  the  Committee  for  Roads;  (iii)  promoting  competitive  bidding;  (iv) \nengaging road design engineers through competitive selection; and (v) establishing a state-owned \nroad equipment company to lease equipment to all contractors.7 Uzbekistan has developed a \nroad sector policy framework to improve governance and accountability, sustainability, transport \nlogistics, and private sector participation. In 2019, the government decided to start further reforms8 \nand unbundle the Committee for Roads, devolving its current functions (owner of road assets, \nroad works contractor, and road operator) to different agencies to improve accountability and \nefficiency. Linked to such reforms, the government needs to diversify investment sources for \nroads to different independent entities. The government is set to expand the country\u2019s road \nnetwork to cater for growing traffic. Government funds and financing from development partners \nare unlikely to match future financing needs, and private sector involvement in road financing \nneeds to be explored. The project is designed to address many of these key issues. In addition, \n \n4  ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2020.

Need for improved road safety. Efforts must be enhanced to improve safety. In terms of \nroad safety, conditions in Uzbekistan are poor, with an estimated 2,496 road fatalities per year, \ntranslating into about 1% of gross domestic product lost per year.10 Poor road conditions and \ntraffic rule violations, particularly of speed limits, are major causes. \n \n10.  Importance of enhancing climate resilience of road infrastructure. Karakalpakstan \nhas a very arid climate, with average temperatures expected to increase by 2.4\u00baC by mid-century \nand nearly 5\u00baC by the end of the century. Roads will increasingly face risks from climate change, \naffecting their performance and life span. The design, maintenance, and planning of roads should \nadequately incorporate relevant risk management. \n \n11.  Need for modernization of design standards. The design and construction standards \ncurrently in use were developed in the 1980s and have been updated periodically, but without \nchanging their essential features. Some provisions for road geometric and pavement design are \nexcessive, resulting in unnecessarily high construction and maintenance costs. \n \n12.  Consistency with national development objectives. Alongside the government\u2019s long-\nstanding focus on regional connectivity (para. 3), the Development Strategy for 2017\u20132021 \npursues  five  priorities:  (i)  improvement  of  the  system  of  state  and  public  construction;  \n(ii) ensuring the rule of law and further reform of the judicial system; (iii) economic development \nand liberalization; (iv) development of the social sectors; and (v) security, inter-ethnic harmony \nand  religious  tolerance,  and  the  implementation  of  a  balanced,  mutually  beneficial,  and \nconstructive foreign policy.11 Transport is crucial to supporting priority areas (iii) and (iv). \n \n13.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and \nsupports five operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities \n(para. 36); (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality (para. 36);12 (iii) tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (paras. 10 \nand 27); (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity (paras. 30\u201335); and (v) fostering \nregional cooperation and integration (paras. 3\u20136).13 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023,14 which calls for investments in the transport \nsector, including road development, and promotes regional connectivity along major CAREC \ncorridors. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan.15 \n \n14.  Key lessons learned. Lessons from previous and ongoing projects are that (i) a strong \nproject management unit (PMU) is indispensable for successful project implementation and \nshould be in place from the planning stage of the project, (ii) tender committee members need to \nhave a full understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement procedures, and (iii) the PMU and the Committee \nfor  Roads  should  streamline  approval  procedures  to  facilitate  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement. \n \n9  ADB. 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the \nneed  for  improving  the  connectivity  and  mobility  of  remote  and  isolated  areas  such  as \nKarakalpakstan. With improved road infrastructure, the accessibility of these areas can be \nenhanced, thus, helping the government to implement future pandemic mitigation measures if \nrequired. Road construction works under the project will start in early 2021 when the spread of \nCOVID-19 is expected to subside and be made manageable by the national COVID-19 response \nmeasures. If this scenario materializes, the project will be implemented within the planned \nimplementation period from 2021\u20132025. However, if COVID-19 is not contained by early 2021, \nthe Committee for Roads will enact measures for resources to be mobilized steadily, albeit at a \nreduced speed, and for construction works to continue without serious threat to peoples\u2019 health.16 \nIn the medium term, the project will play an essential role, helping the economy bounce back \nresiliently and regain its competitiveness in the project areas most affected by COVID-19. This \nroute is vital for international and domestic trade; and will help Uzbekistan achieve its ambitious \nplans to revitalize horticultural exports, revive the ravaged tourism industry and services, provide \nemployment, and regain momentum toward meeting its ambitious infrastructure plans. \n \nB.  Project Description  \n \n16.  The project is aligned with the following impact: regional trade and economic connectivity \non the CAREC Corridor 2 is enhanced, particularly between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.17 The \nproject will have the following outcome: regional trade and road transport connectivity in Western \nUzbekistan improved.18 The project will have the following three outputs. \n \n17.  Output 1: Road from Kungrad to Daut-Ata reconstructed. The 240 km road will be \nreconstructed  to  a  two-lane,  cement  concrete  road.  The  road  design  incorporates  climate \nresiliency measures for the arid Karakalpakstan region. Access roads will be constructed to link \nvillages to the A380. Five rest stops with market stalls will be constructed, 50% of which will be \nallocated for women entrepreneurs with separate sanitary facilities for women and men. Two \nmultipurpose community complexes will be constructed in Jaslik and Karakalpakstan settlements \nto house facilities for livelihood training programs, and maternal and child health care services. \n \n18.  Output 2: Intelligent transport system installed. To improve road safety performance, \nan ITS will be installed on a 100 km pilot section of the Tashkent\u2013Namangan road (A373). This \nroad section has one of the heaviest traffic conditions in Uzbekistan. The ITS will monitor traffic \nand road conditions in real time and help to provide information and warnings on display boards \nand websites. Following the results of this pilot project, the government plans to implement such \nsystems in other parts of the road network. The introduction of an ITS will also help report critical \nincidents involving women, the elderly, children, and those with mobility impairments to relevant \ngovernment agencies for action. The Committee for Roads will submit yearly sex-disaggregated \nreports on road crashes by the type of road user and incident. \n \n19.  Output 3: Weigh-in-motion system supplied and installed. To avoid overloading of \nvehicles on the highway network and to prevent accelerated pavement deterioration, two fully \n \n16 The Committee for Roads will develop and implement a risk mitigation plan to comply with the Ministry of Health and \nWorld Health Organization COVID-19 preparedness and response guidelines to prevent and monitor the spread of \nCOVID-19. The program will comprise health-related measures to prevent and stem the spread of COVID-19 by \nconstruction workers and improve the capacity of the project implementation team on site to protect construction \nworkers and people from the community from COVID-19. \n17 Government of Uzbekistan. 2019.

Before the implementation of the WIM stations, \nthe Committee for Roads will update axle load norms compatible with national legislation.20 The \nWIM stations will be constructed with the ITS systems to allow the collection of overloading data \nand  enforce  anti-overloading  regulations.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  pilot  project,  the \ngovernment plans to expand the implementation of an axle load control program for improved \nroad asset management throughout the road network in line with the strategy.21 \n  \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s involvement in this project provides tangible value. First, updated standards and \nspecifications will be used for civil works under the project (output 1), which have been developed \nand  improved  through  ADB  support.22  Second,  ADB  will  support  the  introduction  of  new \ntechnologies to support traffic management, axle load control, and road safety (outputs 2 and 3). \nThe installation of fully automated WIM systems will extend the life of paved roads, and ADB will \nhelp  improve  local  regulations  on  axle  load  control,  road  maintenance,  and  road  asset \nmanagement to international standards.23 Third, measures will be taken to protect biodiversity, \nand introduce climate change adaptation measures.24 These measures go far beyond what is \nrequired under national legislation, and were developed by world-leading experts in their field. \nFourth, the project will introduce gender-inclusive measures as outlined in the gender action \nplan.25 These will enable women from the communities to develop skills for livelihood activites \nand access maternal and child health services through a telemedicine facility. Fifth, ADB will \nsupport capacity development of the Committee for Roads in several areas, including improving \nproject delivery, strengthening procurement, and introducing modern technologies. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $383.4 million (Table 1), including taxes and duties, \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  and  other  charges  during  implementation.

The Committee for Roads will also recruit additional \nindividual  consultants  (international  and  national)  for  procurement,  contract  management, \nenvironment, and biodiversity to support the PMU. The PMU has hired a project director and core \nstaff, and the remaining staff will be mobilized before loan effectiveness.28 The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM.  \n \n25.  ADB has established a sound donor coordination mechanism and good working relations \nwith other development partners. The government leads a transport sector development partner \ncoordination group, where ADB has the lead role in the road and rail transport subsectors.

The  readiness  of  the  project  is  high,  since  (i)  detailed  design  is  approved  by  the \ngovernment, (ii) recruitment of the project management and construction supervision consultant \nhas commenced in March 2020, and (iii) bidding for the civil works has commenced in May 2020. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The project road\u2019s technical design is appropriate for a road of this standard in this \nlocation, and for the volume of traffic that is projected to use it. The road will remain a two-lane \nroad, with 3.75 meter lane widths, 0.75 meter paved and 3.00 meter unpaved shoulders. Concrete \nsurfacing to be applied to the project road has a long life of more than 30 years, as well as lower \nmaintenance requirements, and is more resilient to climate change. Road safety measures have \nbeen introduced into the detailed design. Climate adaptation measures incorporated into the \nproject  include  temperature-resilient  cement  concrete  pavement,  larger  expansion  joints, \nincreased drainage capacity, and additional salt management measures. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  Economic analysis was conducted based on ADB\u2019s guidelines.33 Direct benefits include \nvehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, and reduced vehicle emissions. The use of \nconcrete pavement will improve the level of service and reduce routine and periodic maintenance \ncosts. An origin and destination survey confirmed that nearly all trips on the project road are \ninternational, confirming its importance to CAREC Corridor 2. The economic internal rate of return \nfor the project is estimated at 11.0%, surpassing ADB\u2019s hurdle rate of 9.0% and indicating that \nthe project is viable. Traffic growth reflects forecasts of gross domestic product growth, revised \n \n33 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n ", "9 \nby ADB in April 2020 to take into account the impacts of COVID-19. Under a sensitivity analysis, \nan increase in costs of 20% and a reduction in benefits of 20% reduces the economic internal \nrate of return to 8.4%. While this is slightly lower than the hurdle rate, it shows that the project is \ngenerally viable in the face of adverse variations in key assumptions. 34 Although not fully \nquantified, the project is expected to have positive cross-border spillover effects. It will increase \ntrade flows and cross-border movement of people between Uzbekistan, on the one hand, and \nKazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and the South Caucasus and Eastern European countries, \non the other. Improved competitiveness and efficiency will materialize in other sectors of the \neconomy through unobstructed access for business entities to regional and international markets. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  Financial sustainability. Since the project is nonrevenue generating, financial analysis \nfocused on whether the project outputs will be sustained financially.35 Projected maintenance \nexpenditure, following the Committee for Roads budget for 2020, averages $7,650 per km.36 The \nestimated annual maintenance requirement for the project road is well within this allocation. The \nCommittee for Roads will establish two additional road maintenance units. The rest stops with \nmarket stalls and multipurpose community complexes are social infrastructure, which will not \ntarget cost recovery or have a commercial component.  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  Institutional capacity. The Committee for Roads will empower the PMU to make contract \nadministration decisions and/or establish a steering committee within the Committee for Roads to \nexpedite the decision-making process, with established timelines for contract-related decision-\nmaking. ADB will continue providing assistance, as needed, to the Committee for Roads and the \nproject PMU to ensure efficient project implementation and compliance with audit and financial \nmanagement requirements. \n \n31.  Legal  capacity.  Recent  reforms  have  clarified  the  lines  of  command  for  project \nmanagement by defining the responsibilities of the Committee for Roads. In December 2018, the \ngovernment empowered the Committee for Roads to act as the executing agency for road projects \nsupported by all international financing institutions. The Committee for Roads has assumed this \nresponsibility from the Republican Road Fund for ongoing ADB-financed projects.  \n \n32.  Procurement  capacity.  Overall,  the  capacity  of  the  Committee  for  Roads  and  the \nproposed PMU to conduct, control, and supervise procurement activities requires strengthening. \nMost public officials responsible for procurement do not have clearly defined terms of reference \nand usually have not received any formal procurement training. For previous projects, this has \nled  to  delayed  procurement  actions,  multiple  re-tendering,  and  litigations.  International \nconsultants mobilized under the project will support the PMU. ADB will continue to provide regular \nin-country guidance and support from ADB. The Committee for Roads will establish a tender \ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  deputy  chair  of  the  Committee  for  Roads,  for  approval  of  all \nprocurement decisions.37 All contracts will be procured in accordance with the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n \n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 The analysis was conducted based on ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n36 This budget includes a wide range of roadworks, including routine, emergency, winter maintenance, and support for \nthe financing of road maintenance units. \n37 Other members will consist of representatives from the Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade, the Ministry of \nFinance, and Uzbek Engineering. \n ", "10 \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan is guided by the following principles: \nfor civil works, the sectioning in 40 km lots was guided by the intent to attract participation from \nlocal contractors alongside international contractors, and divided so that each section is close to \na railway station, reducing logistics costs and reliance on road transport. As for the evaluation \ncriteria, considering the relatively low technology content, it was assessed that the best value for \nmoney would be achieved by using the one-stage, one-envelope system with open competitive \nbidding on the basis of the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder. \n \n33.  Financial management capacity. The Committee for Roads and the proposed PMU \nhave basic financial management capability to (i) record the required financial transactions, (ii) \nprovide regular and reliable financial statements, (iii) provide reliable monitoring reports, and (iv) \nsafeguard financial assets. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate, \nmainly because the Committee for Roads still has no internal audit unit, despite its experience \n(and the PMU\u2019s experience) with ADB. Full-time ongoing accounting support and outsourcing of \nthe internal audit function will be carried out. Until such an arrangement is in place, a thorough \npre-audit of vouchers may be done by a trained financial expert at the PMU before making \npayments. The Committee for Roads will recruit an external audit firm to carry out quarterly \ninternal audits. External audits of all existing projects and the proposed project will be conducted \nby external auditors acceptable to ADB, and the Committee for Roads will ensure compliance \nwith Audited Project Financial Statements submission deadlines. The Committee for Roads will \nprepare and submit to ADB detailed accounting and financial reporting manuals. \n \n34.  Safeguards  capacity.  The  PMU  will  recruit  experienced  safeguards  specialists  by \nOctober 2020. The Committee for Roads will also hire experienced safeguards consultants with \nsufficient relevant experience, including an international and a national environmental consultant, \none with ecology background. \n \n35.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  Committee  for  Roads.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  Women in the project area travel to different destinations to carry out domestic and care-\ngiving  tasks  with  paid  employment,  income-earning  activities,  and  community  and  social \nobligations. However, their mobility is hampered by poor road conditions and lack of reliable, \naffordable, and safe public transportation. The project will provide facilities and programs to help \nwomen build skills to start and/or improve their livelihoods and access to health services and other \nprograms. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming and will build two multipurpose \ncommunity complexes with facilities for livelihood training. The nongovernment organization \n(NGO) engaged in an ADB-supported TA will conduct the livelihood training.38 The community \ncomplexes will house telemedicine facilities to allow consultations by members of the community \nwith health professionals. This will be coordinated by local health care professionals in the local \ngovernment.39 It will also build five rest stops with market stalls for women and separate sanitary \nfacilities. The ITS component will monitor critical incidents, including those involving women, the \nelderly, children, and persons with disabilities; and will submit yearly reports on sex-disaggregated \n \n38 Livelihood training courses will be conducted by the local NGO (Businesswomen Association) supported by ADB. 2019. \nDeepening  Civil  Society  Engagement  for  Development  Effectiveness  Subproject  3:  Deepening  Civil  Society \nEngagement in ADB Operations.

The project will conduct road safety \nprograms; awareness raising programs on sexually transmitted infections, human trafficking, \nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse in the context of travel and safety; and a mitigation \nplan to address risks and comply with core labor standards. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.40 \n \n38.  Environment  (category  A).  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  study  was \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 13 April 2020. The project area is considered a \ncritical habitat with high biodiversity value, supporting 17 internationally and nationally recognized \nthreatened species, including the critically endangered sociable lapwing, saiga antelope, and the \nendangered saker falcon, Egyptian vulture, and steppe eagle. The critical habitat assessment \nconducted as part of the EIA study concluded that the project area is a potential critical habitat for \nthe  saiga  antelope.  A  biodiversity  action  plan  prepared  as  part  of  the  EIA  study  will  be \nimplemented during various project phases to ensure that any adverse impacts on critical habitat \ncan  be  avoided  or  minimized.  The  contractor  will  prepare  and  implement  site-specific \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). Other potential impacts include dust or vehicular \nemissions, noise, and occupational and community health and safety, which will be mitigated \nthrough the implementation of the EMP. Meaningful stakeholder consultations (including with local \nbiodiversity experts and NGOs) have also been carried out as part of the EIA study. Such \nconsultations will continue during project implementation.  \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A land acquisition and resettlement plan was \nprepared based on the final and detailed design of the road in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement; the Land Code of Uzbekistan, 1998; and various resolutions of the Cabinet of \nMinisters.41 The final land acquisition and resettlement plan was disclosed on the ADB website in \nMay 2020. The project will permanently acquire 0.06 hectares (ha) of privately owned land \nbelonging to one owner, and 313.18 ha of state-owned land. It will temporarily acquire 915.77 ha \nof nonagricultural land. One rented commercial structure will be affected. Economically displaced \npersons include one structure owner who would lose the commercial structure and rental income \nfrom the structure, and one tenant who is operating a restaurant in the affected structure. A \ngrievance redress committee has been established. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The country in general, and the project area in \nparticular, does not have indigenous peoples\u2019 communities as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement for operational purposes. No further action will be required.  \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.
