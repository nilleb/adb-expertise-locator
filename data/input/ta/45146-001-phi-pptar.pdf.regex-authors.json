The Government requested ADB to consider financing for the proposed Solid Waste \nManagement Sector Project. The project will help improve the quality of urban environmental \nconditions and achieve the environmental targets of the Philippines Development Plan (PDP). \nConsultant support is required for preparing a feasibility study to develop the sector loan project \nand  confirming  its  viability.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  provisions  of  the  ADB  Country \nPartnership Strategy 2011\u20132016, which will extend assistance to this key subsector expected to \nreceive priority under Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The  ensuing  Project  will  comprise  the  following  outputs:  Output  1:  solid  waste \nmanagement plans of selected local government units (LGUs) prepared; Output 2: investment \nprojects  for  priority  solid  waste  management  facilities  completed;  and  Output  3:  project \nmanagement and institutional capacity improved. \n \n3.  The TA will be implemented in 2 phases, which may partly overlap. The first phase will \nprepare  a  short-list  of  three  (3)  LGUs  suitable  for  participation  and  develop  solid  waste \nmanagement plans for them.1 The second phase will (i) prepare subproject appraisal reports \n(SPARs)  for  the  short-listed  LGUs  prioritizing  components  suggested  by  the  solid  waste \nmanagement plans; 2 (ii) determine the viability of the proposed investments through feasibility \nstudies and preliminary design; and (iii) prepare an institutional capacity development program. \nThe major outputs and activities of the TA are summarized in Table A5.1. \n \nTable A5.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected \nExpected  Major \nMajor Activities  Completion \nCompletion Date  Outputs \nDate \nPhase 1  Oct 2012  Inception  Oct 2012 \n1.
