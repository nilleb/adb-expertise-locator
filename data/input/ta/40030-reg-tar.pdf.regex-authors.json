On 1 September 2005, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+31 Asian \nBond Markets Initiative (ABMI) Working Group (WG) on New Securitized Debt Instruments \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to study the issuing of regional basket currency \nbonds (RBCBs) in Asia. The ABMI is a regional initiative established under the ASEAN+3 \nFinance  Ministers\u2019  Meeting.  The  President,  under  ADB\u2019s  3-year  Knowledge  Products  and \nService Workplan 2006\u201320082, approved the technical assistance (TA) concept clearance on \n3 October 2005.3 The TA design was discussed and subsequently endorsed by ASEAN+3 on \n17 March 2006 at the ABMI Focal Group Meeting held at ADB. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The lack of well-developed local currency bond markets was one of the causes of the \n1997 Asian financial crisis. At that time, overdependence on bank financing forced borrowers to \ntake on excessive short-term foreign exchange exposure to finance long-term projects that \ncould only generate local currency revenue. This created two \u201cmismatch\u201d problems: (i) loan \nmaturities became too divergent, to the detriment of both local creditors and borrowers; and \n(ii) the currencies in which the loans were made became vulnerable to exchange rate volatility, \nor worse, local currency exchange rate depreciation. When international confidence in one local \ncurrency  caused  a  rapid  depreciation  against  the  US  dollar,  a  payments  crisis  ensued, \nexacerbating the loss in confidence across the region (the \u201ccontagion\u201d effect). This led to \nbanking  and  currency  crises  in  several  countries.  With  improved  global  macroeconomic \nconditions in recent years and the structural reforms implemented throughout the region, most \ncrisis-affected economies recovered and have returned to robust growth. However, the lack of \nefficient bond markets in the region remains, so the absence of alternative sources of long-term \nlocal-currency finance continues to be a source of potential financial vulnerability.  \n3.  With this in mind, ASEAN+3 finance ministers established the ABMI in August 2003 to \nboost development of local currency bond markets. Currently, the ABMI Focal Group4 and four \nworking groups focus on (i) expanding and diversifying issuers on local currency bond markets, \nand (ii) developing an environment conducive and attractive to bond market participants. The \nworking groups offer policy recommendations to ASEAN+3 finance ministers, who decide on the \nnext steps for bond market development within the region. ADB has supported the ABMI since \nits inception, particularly through the provision of TA.5 The ABMI also complements work done \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3 includes the 10 members of the ASEAN (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam), Japan, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), and Republic of Korea. \n2  ADB. 2005. Three-year ADB-wide KPS Work Plan 2006-2008. Manila \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 January 2006.  \n4  There were initially six WGs: (WG1) New Securitized Debt Instruments (chaired by Thailand); (WG2) Regional \nCredit Guarantee and Investment Mechanism (the PRC and the Republic of Korea); (WG3) Foreign Exchange \nTransaction and Settlement Issues (Malaysia); (WG4) Issuance of Bonds Denominated in Local Currencies by \nMultilateral Development Banks, Foreign Government Agencies (PRC); (WG5) Rating Systems and Dissemination \nof Information (Japan and Singapore); and (WG6) TA Coordination (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The \nWGs were reorganized in 2005: WG 4 achieved its objectives and was dissolved, while WG5 became WG4 and \nwas renamed Working Group on Rating Systems. WG6 was moved directly under the Ad-Hoc Support Team to the \nFocal Group, an apex body that oversees overall ABMI progress.  \n5  ADB currently provides (or has provided) TAs for the following ABMI initiatives: ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance \nfor ASEAN+3 Regional Settlement Linkage. Manila (TA 6161-REG, for $300,000, approved on 19 December); \nADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee Mechanism. Manila (TA 6127-REG, for \n$800,000, approved on 27 October); ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Multicurrency \n ", "2   \nby other regional forums on bond market development, including the Executives\u2019 Meeting of the \nEast Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).6 \n \n4.  In line with the recommendations included in ADB\u2019s report on the ASEAN+3 Regional \nMulticurrency Bonds7 (footnote 7), a road map was designed with one long-term goal: the \npossible issuance of Asian basket currency bonds for the region.8 The road map comprised a \nthree-stage development process for multicurrency bonds in the region. The report explored \nreverse  dual  currency  bonds 9  as  the  first  step  for  developing  multicurrency  bonds.  It \nrecommended developing RBCBs, comprising a pool of assets denominated in various Asian \ncurrencies as the next stage. Developing synthetic currency bonds10 for the region is the final \nstage. WG1 requested ADB to undertake the second phase of the study and to explore the \nfeasibility of developing RBCBs for the region. \n \n5.  The request for this study comes at a time when the region is experiencing relatively \nvolatile foreign exchange movements against the US dollar. While the present cycle may not \nlast long, a period of currency uncertainty has begun. Given the unstable macroeconomic \nenvironment and the fact that more economies are moving toward more flexible exchange rate \nregimes, there is a greater urgency to examine modalities for closer exchange rate coordination \nacross the region. Foreign exchange stability will reduce risks, reducing uncertainties caused by \nexchange rate volatility, and promoting greater interregional and intraregional trade. A study on \nexchange rate modalities, as part of the study on developing RBCBs, will provide a platform for \nfurther discussion of these issues. \n \n6.   Market experience and anecdotal findings also support the case for creating RBCBs. \nThe European currency unit (ECU) experience under the European Monetary System (EMS), \nestablished over 25 years ago, may be instructive for Asia. ECU-denominated basket bonds \nwere  eventually  accepted  when  it  became  apparent  that  ECU  notes  could  lower  portfolio \nvolatility and reduce risks. The success of ECU-denominated basket bonds, to some extent, \nwas  instrumental  in  developing  Europe  into  an  integrated  bond  market.  Several  studies \nadvocate the development of RBCBs.11  \n \n7.  RBCBs offer several advantages: (i) they provide long-term funding and investment \nalternatives in local currency instruments, thus reducing the risk of a financial crisis; (ii) they \n                                                                                                                                                          \nBonds.

APEC initiatives included the Initiative on Development of Securitization and Credit Guarantee, and \nHarmonization of Bond Market Rules and Regulations. \n7  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Multicurrency Bonds. Manila. \n8  Support for Asian basket currency bond issuance was endorsed at the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting held \nin Istanbul in May 2005. \n9  A reverse dual currency bond is issued with the principal and repayment in one currency with a low interest rate, \nwhile the coupon is repaid in another currency with a higher interest rate. \n10 A synthetic bond uses several Asian currencies for defining a bond\u2019s principal, coupon, and repayment. \n11 See Itoh, T. 2003. Promoting Asian Basket Currency Bonds. Tokyo. University of Tokyo; and Dammer, C., and      \nR.  McCauley.  2006.  Basket  Weaving:  The  Euromarket  Experience  with  Basket  Currency  Bonds.  Bank  for \nInternational Settlements (BIS) Quarterly Review March 2006: 79 \u2013 92. BIS. Basel, Switzerland. Despite the merits \nof RBCBs, outlined in the latter report by C. Dammer and R. McCauley, the following issues should be addressed \nin developing an RBCBs market: (i) effects on domestic bond markets, (ii) loss of liquidity, and (iii) linkage between \nprivate and public sector use of Asian currency unit-denominated bonds. However, the authors concluded that \nultimately the issuers, particularly public institutions, need to weigh any policy benefits of basket issuance against \nany opportunity loss borne by borrowers. These issues will be examined in detail in the proposed regional TA. \n \n ", "  3\nwiden the investor base regionally as bonds denominated in a basket of Asian currencies can \nappeal to both intraregional and extraregional investors; (iii) a diversified pool of currencies in \nthe basket bond minimizes currency risks for both issuers and investors;12 (iv) improved pricing \nand lower funding costs from economies of scale help issuers, compared with single currency \nbond issuance; (v) they provide an optimum structured portfolio for investors as risks are spread \nout and reasonable returns are largely assured; and (vi) they promote greater acceptability of \nAsian currencies internationally in the long run. \n \n8.  The  current  macroeconomic  environment  and  the  benefits  of  RBCBs  have  stoked \ninterest in this type of instrument. However, the perceived impediments to developing efficient \nand  liquid  ASEAN+3  bond  markets  have  discouraged  the  private  sector  from  introducing \nRBCBs to the market. In addition, there is no guarantee that an issue will succeed or that \nsubsequent issues will cover the research and development cost as initial structuring costs can \nbe relatively high, so returns on the investment may not be viewed attractive enough in view of \nthe high cost and risks. The proposed ADB study could ease some of these uncertainties by \nshowing support for developing a new financial product that could help spark regional bonds \nmarket development. \n \n9.  The  design  of  a  RBCBs  market  should  assist  individual  Asian  economies  to  meet \neconomic challenges, so RBCBs issuance should be both substantial and sustainable. It is \nimperative that a RBCBs market must be based on real economic and commercial needs. With \nthis in mind, in its preliminary work, WG1 suggested that a feasible and effective way of \ndeveloping  RBCBs  is  to  use  a  structure  of  asset-backed  securities,  enabling  a  pool  of \nunderlying  assets  to  be  created  and  denominated  in  multiple  Asian  currencies.  Possible \nunderlying  asset  classes  could  include  (i)  government  bonds,  (ii)  residential  mortgages, \n(iii) account  receivables,  and  (iv)  sector  loans  such  as  those  to  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.13 Growing securitization markets, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, \nresidential mortgage-backed securities, or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) markets will \nprovide significant opportunities for developing RBCBs. \n \n10.  Several issues must be addressed to ensure that the structure of the initial RBCBs is \nviable. As bond market development varies across economies, a limited number of currencies \nfrom countries with well-developed bond markets should dominate the basket; other currencies \nmay  be  included  later.  Both  public  and  private  sector  roles  should  be  considered  when \ndetermining  how  the  new  product  development  is  sequenced.  Incentives  for  issuers  and \ninvestors will be crucial, as the success of any RBCBs hinges largely on the support of market \nparticipants. Impediments that inhibit the introduction or growth of RBCBs in Asia should be \naddressed. To properly structure and develop RBCBs in the region, an assessment is needed of \nsecuritization  laws  relevant  to  RBCBs  issuance;  and  laws  relating  to  bankruptcy,  asset \nliquidation, disclosure, taxation, and special purpose vehicles. Helping define an appropriate \nlegal  framework  will  also  assist  ASEAN+3  economies  as  they  move  toward  regional \n                                                 \n12 In Shimizu and Ogawa. 2004. Risk Properties of Asian Monetary Unit Denominated Bonds. Tokyo. Analytical \nresults showed that issuing a basket currency bond would contribute to reduced foreign exchange risk for bond \nissuers in East Asian economies (excluding those with exchange rate pegs). In addition, the currency basket-\ndenominated bonds could reduce foreign exchange risk for international investors in many cases. R. McCauley and \nG. Jiang also find similar diversification benefits. (McCauley, R. and G, Jiang. 2004. Diversifying with Asian Local \nCurrency Bonds. Bank for International Settlements [BIS] Quarterly Review. Basel: BIS [November]). \n13 The first Pan-Asian collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) of Korean small and medium-sized enterprise loans \nwere successfully issued in December 2004 and sold to investors in Japan and other Asian markets. Although the \nCBOs involved only two countries, their success prompted greater interest among ASEAN+3 economies to \nexamine similar schemes with a view to using multiple Asian currencies and underlying assets. \n ", "4   \nstandardization of bond market infrastructure. Finally, partial credit enhancement by bilateral or \nmultilateral agencies should be explored if it helps the RBCBs market to develop. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA aims to reduce regional financial vulnerabilities by offering ways to provide \nfunding and financing alternatives to bond markets. The expected outcome is to increase the \nvolume of cross-border bond issuance and investment in Asian currency bond markets in the \nregion.  This  will  assist  governments  by  offering  policy  recommendations  that  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of RBCBs in the region, remove impediments, and encourage capital market \ndevelopment  for  new  debt  instruments.  The  TA  complements  efforts  by  ADB\u2019s  Office  of \nRegional Economic Integration (OREI) to (i) promote regional economic policy dialogue by \ncontributing active support to ABMI, and (ii) conduct research in the area of regional cooperation \nand integration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The study will identify relevant lessons for Asia from European experiences. Given that \nthe success of the RBCBs will be mainly market-driven, ADB and the TA consultants will consult \nwith market participants through meetings and/or conferences as well as increasing existing \ndialogue with all other stakeholders. The TA design will be relatively flexible to accommodate \nviews from the private sector and government officials. ADB, together with the TA consultants, \nwill  communicate  regularly  with  WG1  members  to  discuss  the  TA  design  and  develop \nappropriate policy recommendations. The scope of the TA, with preliminary agreement from \nWG1 members, includes the following components. \n \n13.  In view of the rapidly changing bond market environment in the region, the study will \nreview (i) recommendations made in an earlier study on the ASEAN+3 Regional Multicurrency \nBonds  (footnote  7),  and  (ii)  the  rationale  of  how  RBCBs  helps  reduce  regional  financial \nvulnerabilities.  The  study  will  also  identify  the  potential  for  RBCBs  development  within \nASEAN+3  by  defining  the  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  RBCBs  markets  for  investors, \nissuers, and intermediaries; and their contribution to bond market development in general.  \n \n14.  The study will examine the experience of ECU-denominated basket currency bonds in \nterms of market development, including an analysis of (i) exchange rate adjustments by the \nExchange Rate Mechanism, (ii) the role played by public and private sectors, and (iii) other \nmacroeconomic adjustments that were required. Relevant lessons may also be drawn from the \nAsian Bond Fund 2.14 \n \n15.  The  study  will  identify  the  conditions  necessary  for  the  RBCBs  market.  Major \nimpediments to creating RBCBs will be examined and a review of existing market conditions for \nentering RBCBs will be carried out. These assessments will help determine a suitable currency \ncomposition for the RBCBs.  \n \n                                                 \n14 The framework for Asian Bond Fund 2, launched by EMEAP in 2005, comprises two components: (i) the Pan-Asian \nBond Index Fund (PAIF), and (ii) the Fund of Bond Funds. The PAIF and eight sub-funds are passively managed \nby private sector fund managers against a Pan-Asian bond index and relevant domestic bond indexes for the eight \nEMEAP markets (http://www.emeap.org). Given the relevance of the PAIF to the development of RBCBs, lessons \nlearned will be included in the study. \n ", "  5\n16.  The study will design its recommendation based on practical cases. For example, an \nasset-backed securities product could be structured backed by a pool of underlying assets that \nare denominated in multiple Asian currencies. Various types of underlying assets (such as \ngovernment bonds, mortgage loans, and account receivables) and various types of loans will be \nanalyzed along with their potential market demand. The study will identify the possible issuers \nand investors, as well as currencies that could make up the first RBCB issuance. Regulatory, \ninfrastructure, or market impediments will also be identified. The role of government and the \nprivate sector will also be assessed to ensure proper sequencing of product development and \nmarket entrance. \n \n17.  The study will propose recommendations to WG1 on what can be done to enable and \nencourage RBCBs market development. The study will cover developing member countries \nsuch as Indonesia, Malaysia, PRC, Philippines, and Thailand. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $650,000. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plans  are  in  Appendix  2.  Participating  ASEAN+3 \nmembers have financed the costs of individual WG1 activities and intend to continue to do so. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. In consultation with WG1, especially the \nWG1 chair, OREI will administer the TA and supervise the work of the TA consultants. \n \n20.  Three  international  consultants  (one  bond  markets  specialist,  one  securitization \nspecialist, and one financial market specialist) will be hired for a total of 16 person-months. The \nconsultants  will  have  extensive  experience  in  bond  markets  and  securitization  market \ndevelopment in the region. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nconsultants will be hired and engaged by ADB as individual consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months and is expected to begin in \nSeptember  2006,  to  be  completed  by  April  2007.  A  series  of  consultation  with  market \nparticipants will be held in October 2006. Thereafter, the first draft report is expected to be \npresented to WG1 in November 2006. With market participants\u2019 inputs, as well as those from \ngovernment officials, the draft of the final report will be submitted to WG1 in February 2007. A \nfinal presentation to WG1 is expected in March 2007. The outline of the final report is in \nAppendix 4. Upon completion, the report will be disseminated within ADB and on appropriate \nwebsites;15 external publication of the report will be subject to approval by WG1 members. \n \nIV.
