INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2014  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  the  Qingdao  Municipal  Development  and  Reform  Commission  for \nAccelerating Investment in Distributed Energy in Rural Qingdao.1 The TA was included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the PRC.2 During the fact-finding mission in \nMay 2015, an agreement was reached with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  PRC  is  undergoing  rapid  urbanization.  From  1978  to  2013,  the  PRC\u2019s  urban \npopulation rose from 172 million to 731 million. About 53.7% of the total population now lives in \nurban areas.3 Rapid urbanization is making it challenging to provide adequate services to urban \ncommunities such as, housing, water, power, heating, sanitation, education, and health care. \nSubstantial investment in infrastructure is needed to accommodate the increasing number of \nurban residents. In addition, Qingdao city faces challenges of high energy consumption per \ncapita, and heavy reliance on fossil fuels.4   \n \n3.  Following the National New Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020 issued by the State \nCouncil  in  2014,  Qingdao  government  is  planning  to  develop  compact  sustainable  cluster \ncommunities located in rural areas, far from cities and towns. Typically, about 3,000\u20135,000 \npersons live within a radius of 1.5 kilometers in such cluster communities. Basic services and \nmunicipal infrastructure must be provided to these communities, including a heating supply.5 \nTraditionally, heating is provided to cluster communities by small-scale district heating systems \nthat use a coal-fired boiler, which is a primary source of air pollution in winter. Qingdao is one of \nthe national low-carbon development pilot cities selected by the National Development and \nReform Commission in December 2012, and adopted a policy banning the use of coal for \nheating systems. Therefore, the application of a traditional district heating supply for cluster \ncommunities is not acceptable. It is costly and difficult to convert to a natural gas-based district \nheating system and to extend the heating pipelines from existing centralized district heating \nnetworks (located in the cities) to rural cluster communities; the small population makes it \ntechnically and economically unviable to connect to the central system.  \n \n4.  To meet the Qingdao government\u2019s target of green, livable, and sustainable community \ndevelopment  in  rural  Qingdao,  non-coal  based  district  heating  solutions  are  needed.  The \napplication  of  distributed  energy  for  heating  supply  using  locally  available  renewable \nresources\u2014such as biomass, shallow-ground geothermal, wind, solar, and waste-to-energy\u2014\nwill be a key part of the solution.6 Distributed energy for heating supply has been successfully \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 April 2015. \n2  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2015\u20132017.

Statistical \nCommunique of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the 2013 National Economic and Social Development. Beijing. \n4  The average energy consumption of urban residents in the PRC is 3.5 times higher than that of rural residents; in \nQingdao urban residents consume 9 times more energy than do rural residents. \n5  Adequate heating services are essential in Qingdao, because sub-zero temperatures typically last for 5 months per \nyear. \n6  Distributed energy is a decentralized small system for heating and power generation that is located close to the \nload center, and typically uses locally available renewable sources.  \n ", "2  \napplied in Northern Europe (e.g., in Denmark, Germany, and Norway). However, there is limited \nknowledge and experience with respect to applying international best practice, and there are \nsome key barriers to implementing distributed energy-based heating supplies in rural Qingdao, \nincluding the (i) absence of a comprehensive assessment of locally exploitable renewable \nenergy resources in rural areas that can be used for heating; (ii) weak technical capacity to \ndesign a least-cost district heating system using locally available renewable resources; (iii) lack \nof  financial  and  nonfinancial  government  incentives  promoting  a  distributed  energy-based \nheating  supply  in  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  absence  of  an  institutional  arrangement  for  the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of a distributed energy-based heating supply system.  \n \n5.  The  TA  will  help  the  Qingdao  municipal  government  increase  its  readiness  for \ninvestment in a distributed energy project in rural Qingdao. It will (i) select a pilot area in rural \nQingdao for deployment of distributed energy; (ii) undertake cost\u2013benefit analyses; (iii) propose \na cost-effective solution to providing reliable energy for pilot cluster communities; (iv) identify \ninvestment needs; (v) review and assess existing policies and standards, and identify gaps; and \n(vi) recommend an appropriate business model to promote a distributed energy-based heating \nsupply. \n \n6.  The TA is well aligned with the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of achieving \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth.  Moving  developing  member  countries  onto  low-carbon \ngrowth paths by improving energy efficiency and expanding the use of clean energy sources \nhas been identified as one of the key means of addressing climate change.7 The PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 identified environmentally sustainable growth as one of the \nthree pillars of ADB assistance to the PRC.8 The TA will promote the use of low carbon \ntechnologies, thus addressing air pollution.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be cleaner, reliable energy services provided in rural Qingdao. The \noutcome  will  be  enhanced  readiness  for  investment  in  distributed  energy  projects  in  rural \nQingdao. The draft project proposal of distributed energy for rural Qingdao will be submitted for \napproval by 2017. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The key activities under the TA include the following: \n(i)  Select a pilot area in rural Qingdao. Locally available renewable resources, \nenergy supply condition, and projected heat load will be assessed, and a pilot \narea for deployment of distributed energy will be selected in rural Qingdao. \n(ii)  Undertake  cost\u2013benefit  analyses  and  propose  a  cost-effective  solution. \nCase studies of similar communities in Europe and the PRC that use distributed \nenergy\u2014examining the supporting policy, development plan, available renewable \nresources, energy demand, adopted technology, financing arrangements, and \nenvironmental and social impacts\u2014will be conducted for the pilot area. Suitable, \ninnovative  technical  solutions  will  be  proposed,  with  a  focus  on  the  most \nexploitable renewable sources based on local conditions, including wind, solar, \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2014.

Cost\u2013benefit \nanalyses will be undertaken and the most cost-effective technical solution for the \npilot area in rural Qingdao will be selected.  \n(iii)  Identify investment need. Investment needs in the short, mid-, and long term \nwill be prioritized and possible financing sources identified.  \n(iv)  Assess existing policies and standards. Existing national and local policies \nand standards for implementing distributed energy projects in rural Qingdao will \nbe assessed, policy gaps identified, and recommendations made for changes.  \n(v)  Recommend an appropriate business model. The most appropriate business \nmodel for sustainable implementation of distributed energy in rural Qingdao will \nbe developed. Recommendations for private sector engagement will be made. \n(vi)  Disseminate technical assistance findings and recommendations. Capacity \ndevelopment training, including an overseas study tour and workshops, will be \nconducted. Consultation meetings will be held to disseminate TA findings and \nbest practices (international and from other provinces in the PRC). \n \n9.  Major risks are that the (i) identified policy changes are not adopted, (ii) government\u2019s \nlengthy internal process to approve the proposed business model and technical solutions delays \nreadiness, and (iii) local counterpart has limited capacity. To mitigate those risks, capacity \ndevelopment  training  and  workshops  will  be  organized,  a  suitable  business  model  will  be \nproposed,  and  close  coordination and  monitoring  among  ADB,  the  executing  agency,  and \nimplementing agency will be established.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $389,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office \nsupplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The executing agency will be the Qingdao Development and Reform Commission. The \nimplementing agency will be Qingdao Energy Group.9 The TA will be implemented over a period \nof 18 months, from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2016. The TA will require 3 person-months of \ninputs from international consultants, and 24 person-months of inputs from national consultants. \nTo reduce the administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, the \nconsulting services under the TA will be engaged on an output-based (lump-sum) contract. The \noutline consultant terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n12.  A firm with a team of international and national consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime), to conduct the study using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method (with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10), following the submission of a simplified technical proposal. ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be  followed  and  the \nshopping method to be used to procure equipment under the TA. Equipment will be used by the \nconsultants during implementation and turned over to the executing agency upon TA completion. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2014.

The TA will be monitored through the (i) consultant\u2019s progress report, and (ii) TA review \nmissions. Two workshops will be organized for the consultation regarding the interim and draft \nfinal reports, with relevant government officials, district heating companies, potential investors, \nand donors invited. One overseas study tour (Denmark, Germany, or Norway with similar rural \ndistributed energy development) will be organized for relevant government officials and district \nheating companies. The overall results of the TA and lessons from European countries and \nother provinces in the PRC are expected to be disseminated through workshops, training, and \nthe study tour. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Accelerating Investment in Distributed \nEnergy in Rural Qingdao, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nImpacts the Project is aligned with:   \n Cleaner and reliable energy services provided in rural Qingdao by 2025 (Statistics of Qingdao, \n annually) \n \nResults   Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nChain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By 2017     \nReadiness for investment  Draft project proposal of  Information from the  Identified policy   \nin distributed energy  distributed energy for rural  Qingdao DRC and  changes are not \nproject in rural Qingdao  Qingdao submitted for approval other relevant  adopted. \nenhanced  (2015 baseline: 0)  government authorities    \n    The government\u2019s \n  lengthy internal \nprocess to approve \nthe proposed \nbusiness model and \ntechnical solutions \ndelays readiness. \n \nOutputs  By 2016       \n1.
