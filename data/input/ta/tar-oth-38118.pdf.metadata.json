Improving project implementation performance continues to be a priority concern of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). At the same time, as ADB identifies new projects as well as \nnew modalities to assist developing member countries (DMCs), the need for more training for \nexecuting agency (EA) staff becomes apparent. Since the inception of these regional and \ncountry  project  implementation  and  administration  seminars  in  1978  funded  by  technical \nassistance (TA) grants, ADB has helped borrowers and EAs strengthen their capabilities to \nmanage project implementation. Senior and middle-level officials of EAs, central ministries, and \nstate banks from 34 DMCs have participated in these training programs. Meanwhile, resident \nand regional missions have continued to transmit to ADB headquarters requests by various \nDMCs for EA staff training. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A core good-governance strategy that applies to all sectors and on which ADB remains \nfocused in the medium term is capacity building. Training programs provided under this TA1 \nunderlie a systematic and long-term approach to capacity building for project implementation in \nDMCs. The TA fulfills two capacity-building objectives: institution strengthening and human \nresource development. The training programs indirectly support other governance strategies on \nimproved accountability, transparency, and anticorruption efforts. \n \n3.  Current  initiatives  to  improve  portfolio  management  emphasize  DMC  ownership  of \nprojects and capabilities for project implementation. The ability to implement projects efficiently \nand economically depends on the knowledge, skills, and experience of project EA staff. A large \nnumber of personnel in DMCs have acquired substantial experience in project implementation \nover  the  years.  However,  further  practical  and  regular  training  in  procurement  and \nadministration of other project implementation activities, as well as in new areas in procurement, \nis needed to (i) familiarize new EAs that are entrusted with implementing ADB-assisted projects, \nand are either from new borrowing member countries or from DMCs that may have borrowed \nfrom ADB but are not yet fully familiar with the Guidelines for Procurement, Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, disbursement procedures, and other associated subjects in procurement, \nproject implementation, and administration procedures; and (ii) train EAs that have administered \nADB-assisted projects but may need to transfer and replace staff of ongoing ADB-assisted \nprojects, or acquire new staff for new projects, or both. Project managers, especially those \nnewly  appointed,  should  be  introduced  to  the  latest  concepts  and  techniques  of  project \nimplementation  and  administration  and  to  updated  guidelines,  policies,  and  procedures  on \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursements. Lessons learned from earlier projects \nshould be shared with project managers.  \n \n4.  Country  portfolio  review  missions  routinely  conclude  that  delays  in  project \nimplementation are largely caused by a lack of understanding of, and unfamiliarity with, ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  and  guidelines.  The  TA  training  programs  are  designed  to  address  these \ndeficiencies by upgrading or updating project implementation skills of EA personnel and to \nimprove familiarity with, and application of, guidelines, policies, and procedures on procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursements. Awareness of new procurement approaches that are \ngaining  prominence  internationally,  including  electronic,  \u201cgreen,\u201d  and  socially  responsible \nprocurement, should be raised. Good practices in these aspects of procurement will likely be \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 29 March 2004. \n ", "2  \nincorporated into the regular seminar curriculum, and international conferences will provide a \nforum to exchange experiences in such practices to identify the key elements that can lead to \nfurther improvement of procurement procedures. \n \n5.  Since 1990, over 4,200 project-related personnel have participated in the 136 seminars \nso far conducted. Evaluation and feedback from seminars indicate that the training programs \nstrengthen  participants'  professional  skills  and  increase  their  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  for  project  implementation  and  administration.  Lessons  learned  from  these \nseminars have led to amendments to clauses in the standard bidding documents, as well as \nchanges in the content and focus of the seminars\u2019 case studies and exercises. The seminars\u2019 \nstructure  and  content  are  continually  revised  and  improved  based  on  suggestions  from \nparticipants and in response to the changing needs of EAs and ADB. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n6.  The seminars will improve the skills of project directors, managers, and other key staff \nmembers of EAs in project implementation and administration, and improve their understanding \nof  ADB's  guidelines  and  procedures  on  procurement  of  goods  and  works,  selection  and \nengagement  of  consultants,  disbursements,  and  knowledge  of  updated  principles  and \ntechniques  derived  from  accepted  international  practice.  Officials  attending  the  special \nprocurement conferences will become familiar with new topics in the broad field of procurement \nand project implementation. The new stock of knowledge gained by personnel and officials will \nupgrade the implementing capacity of EAs and DMCs in general, while the special procurement \nconferences are expected to lead to the adoption of policies and/or programs on the appropriate \nelements of electronic, \u201cgreen,\u201d and socially responsible procurement for specific DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  One regional and nine country seminars on project implementation and administration \nwill be conducted. The seminars will have similar formats, schedules, and content. Three \nregional conferences covering electronic, \u201cgreen,\u201d and socially responsible procurement will be \nconducted. Training materials will be improved, and Web-based training methods developed to \nimprove content and allow training programs to expand their reach. \n \n8.  The regional seminar to be held at ADB headquarters will follow the same format and \nschedule as the country seminars, but offer additional presentations in modules 1, 5, and 6 \n(Appendix 3) as ADB headquarters staff resources will be available. The regional seminar will \nlast 10 days, and newly appointed project directors and senior policymakers of central agencies \nwill form the target group. Pre-seminar questionnaires will be sent to nominated participants to \nhelp focus discussions on certain topics and issues.  \n \n9.  The nine country seminars, each lasting 9 days, will be conducted in India, Indonesia, \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Nepal, People\u2019s Republic of China, Philippines, \nUzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Countries selected include DMCs (i) where loans approved in 2004-\n2005 involved new EAs, (ii) receiving a large number of loans annually, (iii) that requested \ninclusion, and (iv) that need the seminar as a result of analyses undertaken during country \nportfolio review missions. All concerned sector divisions, as well as resident missions, will be \nconsulted before final selection. The target participants are project managers and middle-level \n ", "  3\nproject staff. A no-objection letter from each participating DMC will be obtained before the TA is \ncarried out in the participating DMC. The seminars will be flexible in terms of modules and size \nof participation. \n \n10.  While the format, schedules, and content of the seminars are similar, the issues that \narise from discussions may differ. More general and crosscutting issues can be addressed \nduring the regional seminar by calling upon headquarters specialists. The country seminars will \nfocus on building project implementation skills. \n \n11.  The regional conferences will consist of lectures and special presentations by experts, \npresentation of country experiences, and workshops on specific issues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, which will support the \nregional seminar,  nine country seminars, and three regional conferences.2 The detailed cost \nestimates are shown in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA \nSpecial Fund.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n13.  The Central Operations Services Office (COSO) will be responsible for implementing this \nregional TA. Nominations for participation will be solicited from ADB\u2019s regional departments. A \nlist of ADB-recommended nominees will then be submitted to the governments for consideration \nand endorsement. Acceptance of additional nominations proposed by the governments will be \nsubject to confirmation by ADB. \n \n14.  The seminars will address the responsibilities of managers and other key project officials \nin  project  implementation,  including  pre-implementation  activities  of  project  packaging  and \nprocurement planning, start-up activities of consultant selection and procurement, and the \nprincipal implementation concern of disbursement. The scope and content include discussion of \nissues and situations that arise in relation to these activities, as well as good practices in \nevaluation methods and decision making. The conferences will disseminate good international \npractices in the new procurement areas, as well as share experiences among DMCs. The \nprograms will follow the sample seminar outline in Appendix 3. The seminars will be conducted \nin English, and combine  lectures, case studies, group discussions, workshops, and practical \nexercises. For the country seminars, interpreters may assist the resource persons. The lectures \nwill deal with project implementation concepts and systems, including how to adapt them to the \nlocal project setting. The case studies will analyze problem situations and the decision-making \nprocess.  The  class  exercises  will  test  and  reinforce  the  participants'  abilities  to  apply \nimplementation tools and techniques in relation to the types of projects assisted by ADB. An \nimportant  feature  of  each  seminar  will  be  a  workshop  on  the  problems  and  issues  the \nparticipants have encountered in their projects. The conference outline is in Appendix 3 and \nincludes lectures, tutorials, and presentations of country experiences. \n \n15.  Invitations will be extended to project directors and managers, and to other key staff \nfrom the EAs of ADB-assisted projects\u2014as far as possible, projects at the inception stage. \nParticipation of selected policymakers from central agencies involved in the formulation of \n                                                 \n2  The regional conferences may be co-sponsored by other multilateral development banks, but the estimate includes \nonly the cost of ADB participation. \n ", "4  \nfinancial and procurement regulations will be encouraged. About 40 participants for the regional \nseminar and 30 participants for each country seminar will be selected in consultation with the \nADB's regional departments and resident and regional missions. TA activities are expected to \nstart on 1 January 2005 and be completed by 31 December 2006. The resource persons for the \ncountry  and  regional  seminars  will  be  from  ADB,  particularly  procurement  and  consulting \nservices specialists from COSO and staff members from the Controller\u2019s Department. Resource \npersons from other multilateral development banks may be invited to the regional conferences, \nwhile consultant services will be used to improve training methods and materials. About 6 \ninternational person-months and 3 domestic person-months of individual consulting services are \nto be recruited for the two projects. Outline terms of reference for consultant services are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.
