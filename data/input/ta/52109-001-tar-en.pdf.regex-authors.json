The  regional  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nstrengthening of electronic government procurement (e-GP) systems across developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).1 Strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity is an operational priority under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.2 Aligned to the strategy, \nADB will continue to adhere to standards for procurement and contribute to maintaining and \nraising  standards  in  the  international  development  community.  ADB  will  assist  DMCs  in \nundertaking reforms and building country systems, including the use of e-GP, a central pillar of \ngovernance in public spending. This will help improve the efficiency of public procurement and \nincrease the use of e-GP. ADB will also continue to assist executing and implementing agencies \nin strengthening their capacity to plan, design, finance, and implement ADB projects, and to use \nadvanced technology for robust e-GP systems. \n \n2.  The TA will fulfill ADB\u2019s role as a promoter, facilitator, and enabler of e-GP in its DMCs. It \nwill build on past and ongoing e-GP initiatives in Asia and the Pacific, and also is a follow-up to \nADB\u2019s TA for the Asia Pacific Public Electronic Procurement Network,3 building on its outputs, \nlessons, and identified trends. Besides continuing regional cooperation between ADB\u2019s DMCs \nand  with  other  regional  procurement  networks  (Inter-American  Network  on  Government \nProcurement), the TA will expand e-GP implementation support, including but not limited to \nassessments of e-GP systems, security audits, procurement, contract management, and budget \nexecution and monitoring. \n \n3.  The TA is included in the Technical Assistance Fund corporate priority list for ADB\u2019s \nProcurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department in 2018. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Electronic procurement is gaining traction across ADB\u2019s DMCs, as evidenced by ADB \nsurveys conducted in 2011, 2014, and 2017.4 In 2011, only a third of ADB\u2019s DMCs had started \nimplementing e-GP and, by 2017, more than two-thirds had made the shift, albeit following \ndifferent approaches and business implementation models. These systems are in different stages \nof development, with a substantial number still in the pilot phase for several key e-GP functions. \nInitial e-GP installations started with the publication of bid opportunities and contract awards, then \nprogressed to new functional modules such as e-tendering, use of e-reverse auctions, and e-\ncatalogues. External information technology systems\u2014covering budgets, business registration, \ncustoms, and taxation\u2014began to be integrated with e-GP in 2014, and the results of openness, \ntransparency, efficiency, and cost savings are emerging. Some countries that did not possess the \nrange of in-house skills required to develop and run a system turned to commercial applications \nthrough public\u2013private partnerships5 and Software as a Service (SaaS), a facility where a third-\nparty provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2018. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Asia Pacific Public Electronic Procurement Network. Manila (TA 8520-REG) \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/47192-001/main  \n4  ADB. 2017. Consolidated View and Analysis of Survey Responses on e-Government Procurement System. Manila \n(consultant\u2019s report). https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/47192/47192-001-tacr-en.pdf. \n5  In 2017, China Telecom Corp and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. started a comprehensive strategic partnership that \nincluded government procurement. http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-05/14/content_29339794.htm, \n ", "2 \n5.  The new ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) specifically refers \nto ADB leveraging the use of e-GP because it offers opportunities to innovate and streamline \npublic procurement for greater efficiency and economy. e-GP can also contribute to improved \ngovernance, particularly when aligned with initiatives in budgeting, taxation, and audit. ADB has \npromoted e-GP as a key component of procurement reforms in DMCs, highlighting its potential to \nenhance procurement transparency and provide wider access to information and markets. \n \n6.  ADB  and  other  multilateral  development  banks  (MDBs)  assessed  multiple  e-GP \ninstallations  throughout  the  region 6  and  endorsed  their  use  for  procurement  funded  by \ninternational financial institutions. The digitization era is helping accelerate e-GP deployment. \nADB\u2019s  TA  for  the  Asia  Pacific  Public  Electronic  Procurement  Network  funded  four  annual \nconferences: Manila (2015); Seoul (2016); Tbilisi (2017); and Washington, DC (2018). The fourth \nannual conference was a follow-up event to the Global Public Procurement Conference7 held \njointly with the Inter-American Network on Government Procurement and the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank in Washington, DC along with eight other development partners, providing a \nunique opportunity for Asia Pacific Public Electronic Procurement Network members to learn from \nand build connections with public procurement professionals around the world. \n \n7.  While significant progress has been achieved, substantial scope for further development \nremains, especially in the areas of emerging technologies for digitized procurement, cross-border \nand global trade, and cooperation and seamless integration with other parts of e-government and \nbanking applications. As a trusted regional development partner, ADB has a key role in leveraging \nits current digitization programs to benefit public procurement outcomes. The TA will foster \nregional cooperation and knowledge sharing of public procurement practices. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: enhanced transparency and efficiency in the \nprocurement  process  by  continuously  modernizing  the  procurement  systems,  including  e-\nprocurement.8 The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of public procurement agencies \nto implement e-GP solutions based on international best practices strengthened.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will have the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: e-GP mainstreamed. This output will support preparation, rollout, and \nenhancement of e-GP in selected DMCs, prioritizing the use of e-GP systems for \nADB-funded  procurement.  This  will  include  e-GP  country,  sector,  or  agency \nassessments; funding of external security audits; recruitment and performance \nmonitoring for ongoing Software as a Service support, and other interventions \nnecessary for mainstreaming e-GP in DMCs effectively and efficiently and for \nimplementing e-GP in ADB-supported projects.10 \n                                                \n6  ADB assessed 26 e-GP systems in eight countries (1 e-GP system in India). \n7  Global Public Procurement Conference 2018. http://gppc2018.com/web/home. \n8  ADB. 2017. ADB Procurement Policy. Manila. https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-procurement-policy. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  In Azerbaijan, the draft public procurement law, which is being reviewed by the Parliament, envisages the introduction \nof e-GP. In February 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture requested ADB\u2019s support to pilot e-GP in its projects. \n ", "3 \n(ii)  Output 2: Skills sets on e-GP strengthened. The TA will organize targeted \nannual conferences on e-GP to help develop a solid understanding of international \ne-GP good practices and improve the skills of government staff in various sectors \nto implement e-GP successfully. Regional conferences, in collaboration with other \nMDBs, will further spur cross-regional dialogue and exchange of best practices. \nKnowledge  products  prepared  in  output  3  will  be  disseminated  during  the \nconferences.  The  events  will  employ  innovative  conferencing  and  delivery \nmodalities,  and  may  include  workshops,  seminars  co-hosted  with  other \ndevelopment partners, and support to web-forum. \n(iii)  Output 3: Knowledge products on emerging issues of digitized procurement \nprepared. This  output will  expand  the  delivery  of  demand-based knowledge \nworking papers on e-procurement, addressing emerging issues such as the use of \nartificial intelligence and blockchain technology for bid security and authentication \npurposes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). Considering the demand-driven nature of the TA, \nthe probability for additional financing during implementation is envisaged. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA through its Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management \nDepartment.  The  department  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants;  organize \nworkshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons at workshops and other capacity-building \nevents. The participation of DMCs and selection of procurement agencies to be supported under \nthe TA will be demand driven. \n \n12.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  January 2019\u2013December 2022 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: SSS (In-Tend Ltd., UKG)  Software as a Service  $70,000 \n(4-year contract) \nFirm: QCBS (90:10)a  External security audit  $50,000 \nof e-GP systems \nIndividual: Framework agreement  International expertise  $250,000 \n(e-GP experts for four positions)  (12 person-months) \nIndividual: Individual selection (e- National expertise  $12,000 \nGP expert and coordinator)  (4 person-months) \nIndividual: Individual selection  National expertise  $27,000 \n(events management and logistics  (8 person-months) \ncoordinator) \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB \nRFQ  2 contracts  $10,000 \n ", "4 \nAspects  Arrangements \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, e-GP = electronic government procurement, QCBS = quality- and cost-based \nselection, RFQ = request for quotation, SSS = single source selection, TA = technical assistance. \na  An external security audit of the e-GP system will be procured using QCBS (90:10). The audit is a complex assurance \nprocess that requires a highly skilled, specialized information technology quality assurance team to conduct the \nassessment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \nand its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.11 Consultants will \nbe required to have strong expertise in e-GP, knowledge about government procurement, and \nexposure to best international e-GP practices. Familiarity with procurement systems of MDBs and \ntheir operations is desirable. Consultants must have expertise and experience in using e-GP \nprocurement assessment tools,12 and must demonstrate up-to-date knowledge and experience \nin high-level e-GP technology; or must have the relevant educational background and working \nexperience in the development of e-GP modules. \n \n14.  Knowledge partnerships. ADB will pursue knowledge partnerships with other MDBs, \nstarting first with the Inter-American Development Bank. \n \n15.  Transfer of funds. TA implementation envisages a potential collaboration with the Public \nProcurement Service of the Republic of Korea, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development \nBank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Trade Organization, \nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the European Commission. \nThe TA may elect to cofinance regional training and capacity-building events, directly benefiting \nADB\u2019s DMCs. Transfers of funds to other MDBs may be required to fund capacity development \nevents jointly. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  procurement.  Procurement  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n \n17.  Social media and websites. ADB will continue to maintain the e-GP website, Facebook, \nand LinkedIn pages. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis for Strengthening the Asia Pacific Public Electronic Procurement Network, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n11 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n12 Such as the methodology for assessing procurement system tools, the World Bank\u2019s country procurement \nassessment report tool, the World Bank\u2019s alternative procurement arrangements assessment tool, or ADB\u2019s country, \nsector, or agency procurement assessment tool. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with  \nEnhanced transparency and efficiency in the procurement process by continuously modernizing the \nprocurement systems, including e-procurement.a \nPerformance Indicators \nData Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and  Risks \nReporting Mechanisms \nBaselines \nOutcome       \nCapacity of public  At least 30% of ADB open  ADB\u2019s procurement review  DMCs do not pursue \nprocurement  competitive bidding  system  cross-border trade \nagencies to  contracts will be processed  openness as part of \nimplement e-GP  through e-GP systems by  the requirement for e-\nsolutions based on  2023 (Baseline: not  GP development and \ninternational best  applicable)  deployment. \npractices \n \nstrengthened \nDMCs do not \nmainstream the use of \ntheir e-GP system for \nall of their government \nprocurement activities. \nOutputs       \n1. e-GP  1a.
