THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $500,000,000 to Ooredoo Q.P.S.C. (Ooredoo) for the Nationwide Data Connectivity Project \nin Myanmar. \n \n2.  The  loan  will  finance  the  rolling  out  of  fixed  and  wireless  broadband  services  and \nupgrading of Ooredoo\u2019s mobile telecommunications networks in Myanmar.1 The project is being \ndeveloped under a 15-year operating and associated spectrum license on a build\u2013own\u2013operate \nbasis that authorizes Ooredoo to provide a full range of fixed and mobile telecommunications \nservices nationwide. The project will benefit the Myanmar population by increasing the availability \nand quality of telecommunications and data connectivity services throughout the country, which \nwill  lead to greater sustainable socioeconomic growth and poverty reduction. As a  project \nclassified  gender  equity  as  a theme,  it  will  advance  inclusive  sustainable  development  by \npromoting the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in support of gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project  identification.  Universal  access  to  ICT  is  critical  in  fostering  a  country\u2019s \nsocioeconomic growth and is at the heart of economic growth and development. In addition to the \ndirect benefits, scaling up investments in telecommunications infrastructure will (i) improve access \nto  domestic  and  regional  markets,  (ii)  attract  private  investment,  (iii)  reduce  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment gaps, and (iv) help reap gains from regional connectivity and integration. The \nexpansion of telecommunications coverage in remote villages will provide the rural poor with \nmobile and data access to enable better communication with families and communities; access \nto information, news, and education; and better delivery of government services. Overall, this will \nstimulate  economic  development,  providing  access  to  improved  jobs  and  small-to-medium \nbusiness opportunities. \n \n4.  Decades of isolation have led Myanmar to become one of the least connected countries \nin Southeast Asia\u2014for every 100 people, only seven had access to a mobile phone, 0.5 had fixed \ntelephone lines, and 0.7 had a broadband internet subscription in 2013.2 Myanmar liberalized its \nmobile telecommunications market in 2013, opening it to foreign investment. Following one of the \nmost competitive international tenders with more than 90 applicants, the Government of Myanmar \nawarded telecommunications operating and associated spectrum licenses to Qatar's Ooredoo \nand Norway's Telenor Group in June 2013. Since then, there has been a significant change to \nthe telecommunications industry with the mobile penetration rate rising from 7% in 2013 to nearly \n90% in 2017. By the end of 2017, the number of mobile subscribers in Myanmar reached 50 \nmillion, and smartphone penetration rates soared to more than 70% of the country\u2019s mobile \nconnections. \n \n5.  Although Myanmar's telecommunications market leapfrogged from analog to the digital \nera  in  a  short  period  of  time,  substantial  investments  are  required  to  upgrade  its  mobile \n                                                \n1  Ooredoo provides nationwide coverage of second- and third-generation mobile telecommunications networks, and \nis rolling out a fourth-generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network across the country. \n2  Government  of  Myanmar,  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications.  2013.

Nay Pyi Taw. \n \n ", "2 \ntelecommunications  networks,  including  the  nationwide  rollout  of  a  fourth-generation  (4G) \nnetwork, to enhance their speed and capacity for transferring data. This will enable broadband \ninternet, e-mail, and enriched mobile applications in addition to conventional voice and text \nservices.  Furthermore,  as  the  broadband  market  remains  highly  underdeveloped  with  a \npenetration rate of less than 2%, rapid expansion of fixed and wireless broadband services is \nrequired to cater to the exponential increase in demand for data connectivity from businesses and \nhouseholds. \n \n6.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified the opportunity of providing financial \nassistance to Ooredoo to support its expansion into fixed and wireless broadband services and \nthe upgrade of its mobile telecommunications networks through proactive engagement and strong \nrelationships with key telecommunications players in Myanmar. The goal is to implement ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 and country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132021 for Myanmar, which emphasize \nsupport  for  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  projects  in  new  communication \ntechnologies and the mobilization of private sector resources for innovation and job creation.3 By \nassisting Ooredoo in its next phase of expansion, ADB is supporting the company\u2019s drive toward \nenhancing data connectivity in Myanmar, which is the next phase of development after completing \nthe rollout of basic telecommunications infrastructure that provides conventional voice and text \nservices. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7.  Project design. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n8.  Borrower. Headquartered in Qatar and established in 1987, Ooredoo is a leading global \ntelecommunications company that serves almost 130 million customers. Ooredoo has significant \ngeographic diversification, with operations in 10 markets across Asia, the Middle East, and North \nAfrica. Ooredoo has leading market positions in most of the markets in which it operates. It was \n47th in Brand Finance\u2019s list of the world\u2019s 500 most valuable telecommunications brands in 2017.4 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n9.  Impacts. The project will improve access to quality telecommunications services and will \nalso contribute to raising the mobile and broadband internet penetration rates to enable better \naccess to information, knowledge, and social and economic opportunities. Through ADB\u2019s active \nengagement in incorporating gender elements into the project design, the project (classified \ngender equity as a theme) will promote gender-equitable access; facilitate inclusive growth and \npoverty reduction; and contribute to the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women, \nwhich calls for improving systems, structures, and practices to ensure women\u2019s equal participation \nin decision making and leadership at all levels of society.5 \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2018.

The project\u2019s outputs will be the (i) extended 4G mobile telecommunications \nnetwork and fixed and wireless broadband networks, (ii) enabling environment for achieving \ngender equality in job opportunities created, and (iii) implemented corporate social responsibility \nand community development initiatives focusing on women\u2019s empowerment. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n12.  Consistency with ADB strategy. ADB\u2019s assistance for the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nlong-term corporate strategy (Strategy 2030), which identifies gender equality as one of seven \noperational  priority  areas.  Strategy  2030  also  emphasizes  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure projects in new communication technologies and the mobilization of private sector \nresources for innovation and job creation. \n \n13.  Consistency with country strategy. The assistance is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2017\u20132021 and country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Myanmar, \nas the project promotes the private sector as an engine of growth for inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment, enables access and connectivity to address critical infrastructure needs, connects \nrural and urban areas and markets, and provides access to basic social services such as mobile \nbanking and smart agriculture.6 \n \n14.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  The  Private  Sector  Operations  Department\u2019s \nextended annual review of phases 1\u20133 of the Roshan Cellular Telecommunications Project found \nthe presence of underserved populations to be the main driver of growth in telecommunications \nin Afghanistan; it rated ADB\u2019s private sector development impact excellent as Roshan\u2019s mobile \nsubscriber base grew from 158,000 in 2004 to 5 million in 2011 with greatly increased coverage.7 \nADB\u2019s  previous  operations  in  nascent  and  frontier  telecommunications  markets  such  as \nAfghanistan and Myanmar (footnote 5) show that (i) infrastructure investments led by the private \nsector can be undertaken successfully and sustained in sectors that promote market competition \nand transparency and (ii) ADB\u2019s continuous and active engagement has a strong catalytic and \ndevelopment impact in promoting private sector investment and healthy competition. \n \nD.
