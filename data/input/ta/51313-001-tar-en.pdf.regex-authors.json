INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Indonesia\u2019s national medium-term development plan for 2015\u20132019 aims to establish a \nsocial protection system for all citizens.1 This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nwill support the expansion of Indonesia\u2019s conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, the Family \nHope Program (PKH). The program pays benefits to mothers and aims to reduce poverty and \ninequality through increased access to, and consumption of basic services. The Ministry of Social \nAffairs (MOSA) has enrolled four million new households in 2018, bringing the total beneficiary \nhouseholds to 10 million, but its institutional capacity to scale up and promote PKH is limited. The \nTA will (i) build PKH staff capacity to implement PKH and its family development sessions (FDSs); \n(ii) increase inclusiveness by supporting the PKH expansion to remote areas and vulnerable \ngroups (elderly and people with disabilities); and (iii) strengthen the PKH staff\u2019s analytical, \ncommunications, and advocacy skills to bolster stakeholder support. The TA directly supports  the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030 through the operational priority of ensuring social \nprotection for those in need. It is closely aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132019, \nand included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 of the ADB for Indonesia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Indonesia has achieved consistent and sound economic growth averaging more than 5% \nper year over the last four years, and this rate is expected to continue into 2018. This growth has \nsupported poverty reduction and reduced inequality. For example, the poverty rate has declined \nto 9.8% in March 2018 from 24% in 1999, while the Gini coefficient fell to 0.39 in March 2017, its \nlowest since 2011. Nevertheless, poverty levels remain high for a middle-income country and the \nGini coefficient is still one of the highest in Southeast Asia. About 65 million people are near-poor \nand highly vulnerable to poverty, evidencing the formidable challenges facing the government as \nit works to further reduce poverty and inequality. To address these issues, the government has \nrecognized that poverty has a regional dimension as per capita incomes are lower in rural areas \nthan urban areas, and lower in eastern Indonesia than western Indonesia.3 In addition, income \ndisparities strongly correlate with differences in human capital (health, education) and household \nresilience to shocks.4  \n \n3.  In response, the government increased investments in targeted social assistance by \nexpanding PKH. It adopted unconditional cash transfers to mitigate the impact of rising fuel prices \nin 2005, with a view toward making it a CCT. It launched the pilot CCT in 2007 with design and \nimplementation support from ADB and the World Bank.5 Targeted social assistance programs \nwere in place by 2010 and social assistance expenditure was 0.7% of gross domestic product in \n2016.6 PKH expanded to 3.5 million households in 2015 and to 6 million by 2017. Consistent with \nglobal CCT evaluation findings, PKH has been effective in reducing poverty and improving human \n                                                \n1  Government of Indonesia. 2015.

Manila. \n6  Indonesia\u2019s four large-scale targeted social assistance programs are (i) the Beras Untuk Rakyat Sejahtera subsidized \nrice program; (ii) the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional\u2013Penerima Bantuan Iuran subsidized health insurance program; \n(iii) the PKH CCT; and (iv) the Program Indonesia Pintar cash transfer for poor students. \n ", "2 \ncapital.7 It supports sustainable development goals through its conditions (children\u2019s school \nenrollment, attendance, and health checks; and maternal health care) and payment of grants to \nmothers.8 The 2018 expansion will bring the number of household beneficiaries to 10 million. The \ntotal  program  cost for 2017\u20132020  is  about  $4.042  billion,  96%  of  which  is funded  by the \ngovernment.9 \n \n4.  However, the major upscaling has increased program complexity and put pressure on \ncapacity. The PKH reached 20 provinces in 2010 and by 2016, it covered all 34 provinces and \n514 districts. Apart from new beneficiaries, wider geographic spread, and more transactions, the \nexpansion will add new modes of payment, increase the role of local governments, and broaden \nthe coverage of vulnerable groups in remote areas. The FDSs will also experience significant \nchanges in content and mode of delivery.10 In fact, the surge in coverage has placed additional \nburden on an already challenged human resources and management information systems (MISs). \nThe PKH suffers from high staff turnover (about 20% a year), hiring difficulties, and weak training. \nMOSA aims to hire 16,000 staff who will need training and coaching, as will the existing 26,000 \nfacilitators,  coordinators,  and  supervisors.  The  human  resources  strategy,  performance \nmanagement system, training modules, and delivery mechanisms urgently need updating. The \nPKH MIS also needs strengthening to manage PKH\u2019s increased transactions.11 \n \n5.  A review of Indonesia\u2019s social assistance system highlights additional PKH challenges, \nincluding unequal coverage, low benefit levels, inadequate field staff training and support, and \nlimited coordination with health and education service providers.12 It highlights the need to \nstrengthen implementation capacity, rationalize information technology systems, improve human \nresources  management,  and  provide  adequate  training.  MOSA  is  implementing  reforms to \naddress these challenges, but its capacity is low. MOSA has identified 20 critical technical focus \nareas where TA support is needed, under four broad categories (i) strengthening the PKH delivery \nsystem, (ii) improving access to basic services and program complementarity, (iii) expanding PKH \ninclusion and coverage, and (iv) strengthening the PKH foundations (footnote 8). \n \n6.  Reaching the poor and the vulnerable in remote and disadvantaged regions is difficult. \nThe PKH covers remote and underserved provinces under PKH Akses, which is initially offered \nin Papua and West Papua provinces.13 The PKH faces policy and operational challenges in these \nlocations that require business process modifications. It covers 45,000 households, one-tenth of \nthe potential target of 450,000. Shortfalls highlighted by MOSA and confirmed by the joint \nmonitoring of MOSA, and the National Development Planning Agency include (i) lack of health \nand education services to ensure compliance with PKH conditions; (ii) lack of automated teller \nmachines for payments; (iii) poor physical access, which highlights the need for better logistical \nand administrative requirements for implementers; and (iv) higher levels of vulnerability among \n                                                \n7  E.

MOSA is now expanding FDSs to all beneficiaries. \n11 PKH MIS includes beneficiary registry, compliance verification, grievance redress, and monitoring functions. \n12 World Bank. 2017.

Jakarta. \n13 PKH Akses is the term used by MOSA to refer to the operations of the PKH program in difficult to reach and poor \nregions of Indonesia. \n ", "3 \nbeneficiaries. Other provinces not included in the Akses program also suffer from the same \ngeographic isolation and poor basic services. PKH also extended its coverage to include the \nelderly under the Akses program. However, for beneficiaries in isolated locations and the elderly, \ncompliance protocols required by the general PKH program and operations need to be more \nflexible for PKH Akses. \n \n7.  Finally, awareness and appreciation of PKH is weak, including among key stakeholders. \nAll levels of program operations have low access to information, and PKH staff have limited \ninformation and updates on program guidelines. Beneficiaries, principally women, are often not \nfamiliar with requirements or have weak understanding of the PKH. The need for better-informed \npartners to play a more prominent role in PKH (local governments and supply-side agencies) \nrequires strong communications. The expansion also requires better appreciation of program \nresults by policy makers\u2014including legislators, other government agencies, and media. PKH \ndoes not have a dedicated communications team. \n \n8.  The TA will address key technical support needs identified (paras. 4\u20135). It considers \nlessons learned in the Philippines. 14 ADB will take a lead role in supporting PKH Akses, training \nfield staff, and in developing a communications strategy. The TA is coordinated with other \ndevelopment partners, including partnerships on strengthening program operations, MIS, and \nFDSs.15 The TA will also complement ADB\u2019s ongoing public expenditure management program, \nwhich aims to address deficiencies in social spending and improve the effectiveness of social \nprotection programs.16 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: quality of life improved and disparity and \ninequality reduced (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: MOSA\u2019s capacity to \nimplement, expand, monitor, and report on the CCT program improved.17 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Capacity  of  selected  PKH  implementers  improved.  Training,  human \nresource development, and on-call technical advice are the key activities under Output 1. The TA \nwill undertake a capacity needs assessment and design training interventions for supervisory and \nfield staff. MOSA has identified 15 staff, 300 facilitators and provincial and regional coordinators, \nand 300 supervisors as target trainees.18 Capacity support will focus on strengthening operational \nand management capacity in implementing the PKH and conducting FDSs. The TA team will \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 PKH coordinators and facilitators are the frontline staff dealing directly with beneficiaries. Supervisors are above the \nfield staff and coordinators and exercise some supervision and management functions. \n ", "4 \nreview and improve existing learning modules in cooperation with other partners.19 Human \nresource development support will identify core competencies required by the program, develop \nterms of reference for field staff, design pre and in-service training, and review and propose \nlogistical and administrative support requirements to address high staff turnover. On-demand \nadvice will consist of coaching support in MOSA-identified areas, such as managing cases; \nmonitoring  FDS  outcomes;  managing  multiple  stakeholders;  and  improving  payment  and \naccountability systems, fiduciary management, and MIS support.20 An institutionalization plan to \nbuild the capacity of core Directorate of Family Social Insurance staff and MOSA\u2019s training unit to \nroll out training will promote sustainability. \n \n11.  Output 2: PKH implementation in disadvantaged areas strengthened. The TA will \nsupport the PKH expansion in Papua and West Papua. It will provide advisory support for policy \nand operational issues, human resources and staffing, and specialized training to Akses teams \nand their local counterparts in other ministries and local governments.21 Technical and policy \nadvice will (i) identify expansion options in remote and poor areas for the Akses program; (ii) \nreview the experience of CCT programs on payment frequency and modality, accountability \nmechanisms, grant levels, and logistical and administrative support to frontline staff; and (iii) \nrecommend business processes and improvement plans tailored to local realities. The TA will \nprepare a technical paper on operationalizing the PKH in remote locations, an assessment of \nPKH transfers for the elderly and children with disability, and options for improvement.22 \n \n12.  Output 3: Analytical, communications, and advocacy skills of MOSA staff enhanced. \nThe TA will improve and develop a communications and advocacy strategy for the PKH and will \nhelp  MOSA  establish  a  dedicated  communications  unit.  The  TA  will  develop  options  for \ncommunicating progress and success stories, information on project operations and processes, \nbenefits and payment modes, and other relevant information through traditional and nontraditional \nmedia, such as radio, print, social media, and other broadcast media. Training and coaching will \nimprove the analytical skills of MOSA staff to develop and share PKH knowledge internally and \nexternally, including regular reporting to parliament, local governments, line ministry officials, \nbeneficiaries, and international partners. This output will provide demand-driven analytical and \ncommunications support to MOSA and the National Development Planning Agency for assessing \ncapacity gaps and providing advice to strengthen the noncash social assistance program and the \nPKH.23 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,150,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. Key expenditure items \nare in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, \nsupplies,  furniture  and  utilities,  counterpart  staff,  secretarial  assistance,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. \n \n                                                \n19 The GIZ, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme support FDS module development and the e-learning pilot \nprogram. \n20 Initial areas identified for MIS support include data migration, digitization of records, business process automation, \ndevelopment of applications for field staff, and other information and communications technology uses for the PKH. \n21 These include the local Dinas Sosial and representatives of the health and education ministries; the Department of \nPopulation and Civil Registration; and Himbara, the association of state-owned banks. \n22 Support for the PKH social transfers for the elderly will complement ongoing and proposed ADB support for elderly \ncare policy and home and community-based care services in Indonesia. \n23 This includes reviewing support to improve MOSA\u2019s capacity to manage the Bantuan Pangan Non Tunai program. \n ", "5 \n14.  Ineligible expenditures under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction include (i) vehicle \npurchases, (ii) civil servant salaries, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) \ndetailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under \nADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.24 \n \nD.
