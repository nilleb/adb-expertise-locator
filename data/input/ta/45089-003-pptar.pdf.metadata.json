The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support preparation of the results-based loan \n(RBL) through a program preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). A PPTA is justified given the \nwide-ranging nature of the government\u2019s K to 12 reform agenda, the innovative nature of many \nof  the  proposed  elements  of  the  Secondary Education  Support  Program (SESP),  and the \nspecialist nature of skills required in some areas. The PPTA will assess existing challenges and \nwill provide technical inputs and assessments to assist the Government of the Philippines and \nADB to jointly develop an RBL program that is suitable for ADB financing in all dimensions: \ntechnical, financial and economic, institutional, and safeguards; aligned with the new country \npartnership  strategy  and  built  on  lessons  learned from  Secondary  Education  Development \nProject, Secondary Education Development and Improvement Project, Basic Education Sector \nReform Agenda (BESRA) and other countries\u2019 experiences with extending the education cycle.   \n \nB.   Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will be required to: (i) define program scope and design; (ii) update fiduciary \nand safeguards due diligence; (iii) prepare cost estimates, a financing plan and financial and \neconomic analyses; (iv) support updating of the government\u2019s medium-term expenditure plan \n(MTEP);  (v)  review  options  for  financing  JHS,  including  reform  of  the  education  service \ncontracting  program  or  introduction  of  other  forms  of  financing  public-private  partnerships \n(PPPs); (vi) assess the scope for expanding the use of PPPs to develop junior high school and \nsenior high school infrastructure; (vii) undertake background studies; and (viii) prepare the \nprogram implementation document.

POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Philippine Constitution of 1987 stipulates that all children shall have access to free public basic \neducation: currently comprising 6 years of compulsory elementary schooling and 4 years of secondary \neducation. Although a regional leader three decades ago, stagnation and in some cases regress has \ncaused the Philippines education system to fall behind most regional comparators. Weaknesses in basic \neducation limit access to technical and vocational education and training and higher education, and to the \njob market.  The basic education subsector suffers from gaps in equitable access, quality, relevance and \nweak sector management and efficiency. These in turn pose key constraints to poverty reduction, \ninclusive growth, and international competitiveness.  \n \nThe SESP is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2011\u20132016 Midterm Update, which \nfocuses on three broad  strategies to achieve  its objective of inclusive  growth including,  inter  alia, \nproviding  equal  access  to  development  opportunities  by  investing  in  human  capital,  especially  in \neducation, health, and other basic social services, and leveling the playing field to improve access to \ninfrastructure, credit, land, technology, and other productive inputs.  It is also aligned with the basic \neducation sector reform agenda (BESRA), which provides an overarching strategic framework for the \nPhilippines\u2019 basic education subsector. \nB.     Poverty Targeting: \nGeneral Intervention  Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \nThe proposed program aims to reduce poverty and support inclusive economic and social development \nby: (i) increasing  equitable access to secondary  education; (ii) improving the quality of secondary \neducation; and (iii) strengthening management and governance of secondary education. \nC.  Poverty and Social Analysis \n1. Key issues and potential beneficiaries.  \n \nThe primary beneficiaries are current and future students of the Philippines education system, who will \nbenefit from increased access to higher quality and more relevant secondary education, which will \nimprove their chances of progressing into post-secondary education or integrating into the labor market.  \nStudents and teachers will benefit from more and better educational facilities, smaller class sizes, a \nmodernized  curriculum,  improved  textbook:student  ratios  and  more  teaching  aids.  Teachers  and \neducation sector staff will also benefit from improved pedagogical skills as a result of revisions to the \nsecondary curriculum, training in modern pedagogical techniques, the development of a new teacher \ntraining curriculum and improved teacher training facilities. \n \nLow enrolment and completion rates \u2013 particularly in poor and disadvantaged areas \u2013 reflect an array of \nboth supply- and demand-related factors, including lack of physical access due to distance from school, \nfinancial constraints, poor quality and relevance of what is being taught and opportunity costs affecting \npoorer families.  Furthermore, the current 10-year education cycle is biased towards quantity over quality \nin at least three respects: (i) the overall strategy has been to prioritize enrollment and other input-based \nmeasures above student learning and achievement; (ii) the annual number of official school days and \nteaching hours is higher than most developing countries; and (iii) the focus of curricula and instruction is \non breadth rather than depth or mastery of fundamental competencies. Finally, large class sizes and \ngaps in teacher quality constrain implementation of more student-centered aspects of the new basic \neducation sector curriculum. \n ", "Appendix 5       19 \n \nThere are a number of potential demand and supply side constraints, including:  (i) poverty and other \nmeasures of disadvantage, (ii) lack of preparation in primary school, (iii) lack of quality and relevance in \npublic education; (iv) resistance to reform and change within both the DepEd and the teaching profession; \nand (iv) the capacity of the education system to implement such far-reaching reforms.    \n \nA range of interventions, including school construction and innovative programs such as PPPs will be \nused to address demand-side issues such as lack of affordability and to improve the quality of the \neducational environment.  In addition, the Government sees the K to 12 reform as a catalyst for broader \nreform of the education system in the Philippines, not just an extension of two years to the basic \neducation system.  \n \n2. Impact channels and expected systemic changes. \nThe poor, who comprise majority of those attending the public school system, are expected to have more access to \nbetter and more affordable secondary education as a result of this project.  As such, they will also have better \nopportunities to raise their income and improve their chances of getting a good job and decent work, with the \nimproved quality of secondary education as a result of the curriculum reform and accompanying reforms in \nsecondary education.  \n \n3. Focus of (and resources allocated in) the PPTA or due diligence.  \n \nThe PPTA will look closely at how the benefits from the program will directly benefit the poor, disadvantaged and \nvulnerable, especially those who are at the secondary school age.\n \n \nII.  GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this program or program?  \n \nBoys\u2019 educational outcomes are inferior to those of girls in a number of respects. Gender issues include the need for \nincentives to influence the gender parity index, the need to boost women\u2019s status in the teaching profession and \neducation management, ensuring gender sensitive curriculum, textbooks and infrastructure. \n \n \n2. Does the proposed program have the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of gender equity and/or \nempowerment of women by providing women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?    Yes         No     \n \nImprovements in the quality of, and access to, education will increase opportunities for girls. The expansion of \ndemand-side financing mechanisms such as the Education Service Contracting Scheme, coupled with increased \nsupply of schooling, will provide girls with more choice in education.  Female teachers will benefit from the improved \ncurriculum, teaching aids and increased number of classrooms. Measures to increase the representation of women in \nthe governance and management of education will increase their role in decision-making.      \n \n3. Could the proposed program have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n  Yes         No     \n \nThe project will benefit both male and female students through improvements in the quantity and quality of secondary \neducation.   \n \n \n4. Indicate the intended gender mainstreaming category:    EGM (effective gender mainstreaming)  \n \nIII.  PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \n1. Who are the main stakeholders of the program, including beneficiaries and negatively affected people?
