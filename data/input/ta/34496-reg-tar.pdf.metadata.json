The\ndomestic insolvency laws of each country are likely to be different, yet in a commercial sense all\ncreditors of that insolvent company (domestic and foreign) would expect to be treated similarly.\nSingle jurisdictions experience tremendous difficulties achieving fair and reasonable treatment\nof all creditors when there is no framework to provide for the handling of extra-territorial,\nconcurrent, or cross-border insolvency issues.  The Barings collapse is an example of a cross-\nborder financial insolvency, where assets were at risk of being depleted as they lay outside the\njurisdiction of the courts of both Singapore and United Kingdom (Cayman Islands; Hong Kong,\nChina; Japan; and United States [US]).\nFrameworks - The term refers to laws, legislation, regulations, or guidelines; institutions (court\nor equivalent); and administrative procedures of the selected countries.\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy - The terms are used interchangeably to mean condition of a\nbusiness enterprise that is unable to pay debts as and when they fall due, as well as the legal\nproceedings affecting such enterprise under applicable insolvency and bankruptcy laws.  The\nterms \u201cinsolvency law\u201d and \u201cbankruptcy law\u201d are also used interchangeably and broadly to mean\nlaws  related  to  liquidations,  receiverships,  trusteeships,  rehabilitations,  administrations,\nrestructurings, and reorganizations of insolvent business enterprises.  Although insolvency laws\nmay cover individuals as well as business enterprises, personal bankruptcies will not be the\nprincipal focus of the TA.  The precise legal definitions of \"insolvency\" and \"bankruptcy\" and the\ndetailed  nature  of  applicable  insolvency  and  bankruptcy  laws  and  procedures  vary  from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nUNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (Model Law) - A model law for cross-\nborder insolvency was developed by UNCITRAL under General Assembly Resolution 52/158 of\n15 December 1997.  Development of the Model Law was spearheaded by UNCITRAL and\nINSOL International, an insolvency organization comprising insolvency professionals, such as\nlawyers,  bankers,  trustees  and  receivers.  A  number  of  countries  in  the  region,  including\nPeople's Republic of China, India, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand participated in working group\nmeetings and supported (with few reservations) the Model Law. The Model Law it has been\nadopted by Mexico and Eritrea. Adoption is pending in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South\nAfrica, UK, and US.\nNOTE\nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.", "I. INTRODUCTION\n1. Since the onset of the Asian financial crisis, there has been an unprecedented level of\nendeavors among developing member countries (DMCs) to develop or reform their insolvency\nlaws.  A major contribution of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to these efforts is regional TA\n(TA) 5795: Insolvency Law Reforms, under which ADB assessed the insolvency laws of 11\nAsian  economies  (collectively,  \"RETA  economies\").1 This  proposed  regional  TA2  was\ndeveloped on the basis of the priority recommendations for reform identified and developed\nunder TA 5795.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Although bankruptcy is \u201ca defining characteristic of a market economy,\u201d3 an insolvency\nlaw ranks low on any government\u2019s reform agenda.  The onset of the Asian financial crisis\nproduced an environment in which insolvency and related laws became an important part of\nvarious  governments\u2019  reform  agendas.    DMCs,  including  the  selected  countries  (listed  in\npara. 11), began to recognize that the lack of frameworks for the systematic restructuring of\ninsolvent or financially distressed corporations, or the liquidation of businesses incapable of\nbeing restructured posed impediments to economic recovery by delaying and complicating the\nrehabilitation of financial sector institutions, inhibiting the growth of domestic markets, and\nstifling or restricting foreign investment.\n3. As a result, many DMCs began reviewing insolvency and related laws and practices\n(Appendix 2).  Many of these efforts may be indirectly attributed to the work of ADB under TA\n5795.  Assessing weaknesses and developing good practice standards in corporate insolvency\nlaw regimes became the subject of extensive consultation, discussion, and publicity among\nstakeholders  in  the  economies  covered  by  TA  5795.    Together  with  the  efforts  of  other\norganizations (e.g., IMF and World Bank), TA 5795 contributed greatly to the awareness and\nrecognition of the need for reform and, in some cases, to the actual implementation of reform\nprocesses and adoption of the good practice standards developed under TA 5795.\n4. Among the critical assessments noted in TA 57954 are (i) the absence of formal laws\nand  procedures  for  cooperation,  assistance,  and  exchange  among  bankruptcy  courts  and\nrelated institutions in Asia; and (ii) deficiencies in all of the RETA economies surveyed in\nproviding  procedures  for  cases  of  cross-border  insolvency.  The  purpose  of  providing\nframeworks  to  govern  cases  of  cross-border  insolvency  is  to  (i)  create  predictability  and\n1 TA 5795: Insolvency Law Reforms, for $550,000, approved on 13 July 1998.  The economies included under the\nregional TA are Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines,\nSingapore, Taipei,China, and Thailand.  TA 5795 was commended by and featured in several legal periodicals,\nsuch as Asia Insolvency & Restructuring News, Issue No. 4, 31 December 1999, and Global Turnaround, June\n2000; as well by other organizations, such as Group of Thirty in Reducing Risks of International Insolvency, A\nCompendium of Work in Progress (a reference guide published by Group of Thirty, Washington, DC, 2000).\n2 The RETA Screening Committee approved the TA on 3 December 1999 under the title \"Developing Cross-Border\nInsolvency Solutions.\u201d  The TA first appeared in ADBBusiness Opportunities  (August 2000 Internet Edition).\n3 Bankruptcy demarcates the limits of extending credit, confronting risk, entrepreneurial venture, and corporate self-\ndetermination, and engages all sectors of the economy.  See Carruthers and Halliday, 1998 Rescuing Business,\nOxford University Press.\n4 See Insolvency Law Reforms in the Asia and Pacific Region published in Law and Policy Reform at the Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Vol. 1, 2000 Edition, which presents good practice standards and recommendations for\nreforms developed under TA 5795.", "2\ncertainty in trade and investment transactions; (ii) ensure cooperation between the courts in\ndifferent jurisdictions involved in cases of cross-border insolvency; (iii) protect and maximize the\nvalue of a debtor\u2019s assets for the benefit of all foreign and local creditors; (iv) increase the\nefficiency and fairness of cross-border insolvency administration; and (v)  facilitate the rescue of\nfinancially troubled businesses.  A framework for the handling of cross-border insolvencies will\nalso facilitate the improvement of domestic insolvency law regimes and their application, as a\nresult of heightened international scrutiny and pressure.\n5. In addition, the activities under the proposed TA will (i) foster the policy of rescue (as\nopposed to dissolution/liquidation), which helps to preserve viable companies, thus saving jobs;\n(ii) build regional cooperation on insolvency which will accelerate the sustainable growth of\nregional markets; and (iii) provide for more predictable debtor-creditor regimes.  This will offer\nlarger markets, economies of scale and division of labor.  In these ways, the availability of\ncross-border insolvency frameworks will contribute to ADB's other efforts at building efficient\nand  sustainable  mechanisms  for  regional  economic  growth,  all  of  which  are  essential\nrequirements of pro-poor growth.5\n6. The  globalization  of  trade  and  commerce  has  produced  international  pressures  for\nDMCs to enact laws and provide institutions that can deal with a variety of cross-border legal\nissues, such as contract dispute resolution in international contracts, enforcement of arbitral\nawards and recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  Attention is now turned to\nensuring that cases of insolvency with international aspects receive similar recognition (see, for\nexample, the European Union\u2019s Insolvency Regulation, adopted on 29 May 2000). Exploring\nand promoting regional cooperation in insolvency law and practice in the selected countries\n(para. 11) will provide the opportunity for assessing barriers to adoption of the Model Law,\ndevising methods for overcoming the barriers, and proposing forms of legislation for adopting\nthe Model Law.  UNCITRAL has expressed support for the proposed TA, and will assist in\nimplementing Part A (para. 11(i)).\n7. The selected countries recognize the need for frameworks for regional cooperation and\nassistance in handling cross-border insolvency cases.6  ADB is well placed to facilitate such\nregional cooperation because of both the preliminary work it has done under TA 5795 and its\nmultilateral character.  Without a catalyst such as ADB, none of the selected countries are likely,\nindependently  or  otherwise,  to  initiate  such  a  step.    There  has  been  no  regional-based\ncooperative program in insolvency law other than the recently completed American Law Institute\nproject  on  transnational  insolvency  project  in  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement\ncountries.7\n 8. The selected countries also recognize the importance of informal out-of-court insolvency\nprocesses.  The work undertaken under TA 5795 disclosed a clear commercially based cultural\npreference in the economies studied under TA 5795 for resolving corporate restructuring issues\noutside of a formal court process.  That approach to restructuring is therefore likely to be more\n5 See para. 74, Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific, The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the ADB, 19 October\n1999.\n6 See, e.g., Judge Wisit Wisitsora-At\u2019s (Thailand) articles on cross-border insolvency on www.legal-ex-go.th.\n7 That project was unique in bringing together the governments and policy makers of USA, Canada, and Mexico\nwith the aim of developing and creating areas of cooperation in relation to the insolvency law.  The project was\nconducted through study groups from each country.  Each group isolated important key features of their\ninsolvency laws and then, in combination, undertook a detailed study of how these either permitted and\nencouraged or posed difficulties in cooperation in cases of insolvency with transnational aspects, and how best to\novercome such difficulties.  A similar approach will be used in this TA.", "3\nsuccessful in the region than formal restructuring processes. The Insolvency Report stressed\nthe  importance  of  assessing  the  application  and  results  of  the  various  regional  informal\nprocesses,  with  the  goal  of  strengthening  the  processes  in  the  form  of  a  more  universal\nframework that is recognized, supported, and applied by banking sectors in all parts of the\nworld. The Lenders Group of INSOL International, recently issued its Statement of Principles for\na Global Approach to Multi-Creditor Workouts.  The principles are statements of good practice\nfor all multicreditor workouts, and will be used as a guide in assessment and making proposals\nfor reform.  INSOL International has also indicated support for the proposed TA and will assist in\nimplementing parts A and B.\n9. As  both  insolvency  and  secured  transactions  are  concerned  with  debtor-creditor\nrelationships, there is a need to ensure that any insolvency reforms support secured lending\nand contribute to a more predictable debtor-creditor legal regime.8 The work under TA 5795\nidentified the impact of secured transaction regimes on insolvency regimes and emphasized\nthat development of or reform in either regime should be accompanied by a corresponding\ndevelopment or review of the other.  ADB is the first multilateral to pioneer this integrated\napproach to law reform. For the approach to be implemented by the selected countries, it is\nnecessary to develop factual case studies to demonstrate the current weaknesses of and\nimpediments caused by existing laws, and to develop model frameworks for reform.\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.        Objectives\n10. The overall goal of the TA is to promote efficient insolvency regimes, particularly in\nrespect of cross-border insolvency. The specific objectives are to (i) facilitate the development\nof sound insolvency frameworks for handling cross-border insolvencies; (ii) facilitate regional\ncooperation,  especially  the  exchange  of  ideas  and  experiences  between  courts  and  other\ncompetent  authorities  involved  in  handling  cross-border  insolvency  cases,  and  formal  and\ninformal  workouts  and  restructurings;  (iii)  review  informal  insolvency  frameworks  on  a\ncomparative basis to further develop the informal process; and (iv) develop case studies and\nmodel  frameworks  to  illustrate  how  an  integrated  approach  to  secured  transactions  and\ninsolvency law reform can be implemented.\nB.       Scope\n11. The countries to be covered by the TA are Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, and Thailand.\nThese  countries  were  selected  because  they  either  have  sufficiently  developed  national\nsystems that contemplate regionalinsolvency issues, or are in the midst of systemic insolvency\nlaw reform.  Other Asian countries will be invited to participate in conferences and workshops9\nto ensure that the comparative models for regional cooperation developed under the TA receive\n8 See The Need for an Integrated Approach to Secured Transactions and Insolvency Law Reforms, Law and Policy\nReform at the Asian Development Bank, Vol. 1, 2000 edition (Integration Report). The Integration Report has\nbeen cited and featured in several leading insolvency periodicals, including Global Insolvency & Restructuring\nReview, Law & Policy for the International Credit Market, July/August 2000 edition (A Law Business Research\nPublication); and the International Bar Association\u2019s web site as a conference paper for a conference on\ninsolvency and creditor\u2019s rights titled Insolvency 2000, held on 11-13 June 2000, Italy.\n9 Except for the first conference, each of the other conferences and workshops will build on the findings and\nagreements reached between the selected countries at the previous conferences/workshops.", "4\nwide coverage, and to lay the foundation for broader regional cooperation.10  The primary focus\nof the TA will, however, be the selected countries.  The scope of the TA includes:\nPart A - Cross-border insolvency and regional cooperation: (i) develop studies of the key\nfeatures of the insolvency law regimes of the selected countries on a comparative basis\nto explore and review common features and areas that pose problems in cooperation;\n(ii)  develop,  advocate,  and  recommend  frameworks  for  facilitation  of  regional\ncooperation and contact, in consultation with, among others, the selected countries;\n(iii) prepare factual case studies (based on actual cases from each of the selected\ncountries  during  the  crisis)  and  develop  case  models  to  demonstrate  current\nimpediments to cooperation, methods of overcoming such impediments, and how the\nModel  Law  could  be  adapted  for  regional  use  (including  alternative  proposals  for\ndomestic legislation to adopt the Model Law); (iv) conduct, as agreed upon with the\nOffice of the General Counsel, necessary meetings with government officials and policy\nmakers, e.g., inception meeting; (v) conduct at least three regional conferences (one per\nyear)  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of  recent  experiences,  ideas,  and  problems;11  and\n(vi) improve the web site set up under TA 5795 to include materials developed under this\nTA and other insolvency materials of regional significance, and provide improved links,\nsearch tools, updating and maintenance.12\nPart B - International good practices in informal restructuring processes: (i) study, on a\ncomparative  basis,  the  structured  informal  workout  processes  and  restructurings\nadopted by Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Korea; Malaysia; and Thailand during the\nAsian financial crisis, their economic impact, and relationship with formal insolvency\nsystems; (ii) review and present for discussion international banking sector models for\ninformal  workout  processes;  (iii)  prepare  case  studies  from  the  selected  countries\nshowing their use of informal workout processes; (iv) further develop actual case studies\nto show the employment of informal processes at an international level; (v) propose\nrecommendations  for  future  reform  and  adaptation  for  regional  use  (including  the\npossible  use  of  formal  insolvency  regimes  and  the  courts  to  strengthen  informal\nprocesses and to facilitate the formal endorsement of restructurings developed through\nthe use of informal processes); and (vi) conduct at least two regional workshops on\ninformal insolvency processes and restructurings.13\n10 The TA would benefit from lessons offered by Singapore, which has reciprocal legislation with Malaysia for\ncooperation and assistance in cases of personal bankruptcy; Hong Kong, China, which has a provision for\nrecognizing insolvencies originating in a foreign country; and Japan, which is currently considering a complete\nrevision of its territorial approach to cross-border insolvency. India, Pakistan, and Taipei,China (the remaining\neconomies studied under TA 5795 will be invited to participate in the meetings and workshops.\n11 This will be carried out in cooperation with INSOL International, UNCITRAL, other multilateral and bilateral\norganizations, and international insolvency bar associations.  Participants financed under the TA will be selected\nin accordance with criteria to be established by the Office of the General Counsel, in consultation with the\nselected countries.\n12 Easy access to insolvency information of regional importance will facilitate regional cooperation and coordination.\nUnder TA 5795, a web site was developed for publishing materials developed under the TA.  The web site\ncurrently features the insolvency legislation of the RETA economies, as well as comprehensive studies of the\ninsolvency regimes in them.  The web site is a significant resource for the region.  It is the logical site to include\nTA materials, and other insolvency materials of regional significance.\n13 This will be carried out in cooperation with INSOL International Lenders Group, which has developed universal\nprinciples for application in informal workouts.", "5\nPart  C  -  Integrated  approach  to  insolvency  and  secured  transactions  law  reforms:\ndevelop studies of the key features of the insolvency and secured transactions laws and\ntheir interrelation and prepare case studies from at least two of the selected countries to\ndemonstrate  the  interrelationship,  and  develop  model  provisions  that  provide  for  a\nbalance between secured creditors\u2019 rights and the collective rights of creditors and the\ndebtor.  Model provisions will be discussed at the conferences and workshops under\nPart A of the TA.  Work done under Part A of the TA will also be shared with other\nrelevant groups, such as judicial training institutes, universities, or law societies, for use\nat the national level in, among others, each of the selected countries.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,750,000  equivalent.    ADB  will  finance\n$1,500,000  equivalent,  on  a  grant  basis,  from  the  Asian  Currency  Crisis  Support  Facility\n(ACCSF),  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.    Participating  institutions,  UNCITRAL  and\nINSOL International, will provide an estimated $250,000 equivalent in kind or through staff\nparticipation.  The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.\nD.       Implementation Arrangements\n13. The TA will be implemented by the Office of the General Counsel with the assistance of\ninternational and domestic consultants. About 16.5 person-months of consulting services will be\nrequired: 14 international and 2.5 domestic.  Indicative terms of reference for the TA consultants\nare in Appendix 4. The international consultants will identify suitable domestic resource persons\nto assist with the TA (about 20 person-months/country), and identify and manage the domestic\nconsultants (Philippines) for the work to improve the web site created under TA 5795.  All\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements acceptable to ADB for recruiting domestic consultants. Equipment for\nthe TA will be leased where possible.14  Where it is more economical and efficient to procure\nsuch equipment, it will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  At\nthe conclusion of the TA, ADB's Office of Administrative Services will be consulted on the future\nlife and use of the procured equipment.  The TA will be implemented three years, commencing\nin February 2001.15\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION\n14. The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 for the\npurpose of Promoting Regional Cooperation in the Development of Insolvency Law Reforms.\n14 For example, it may be necessary to lease equipment for the conduct of the conferences: translation and other\nconference facilities, software, and a computer.\n15 A lesson from other law and policy reform projects is that law reform is a long-term process.  A minimum of three\nyears is justifiable, and indeed is necessary, to ensure that regional cooperation and collaboration are achieved\nwith a sound framework for continuity.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary PerformanceTargets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions/Risks\nOverall Aim\nPromote efficient insolvency Asian Development bank Dialogue and advocacy Inception meetings to\nregimes - particularly in (ADB) impact with governments and ensure interest and\nrespect of cross-border assessment and insolvency professionals commitment of\ninsolvency - that promote evaluation at conclusion governments to address\neconomic growth of the technical needed reforms to\nassistance (TA) insolvency frameworks\nObjectives\n(cid:129)  Facilitate the Develop applications of Acceptance of TA 5795 As above\ndevelopment of sound Model Law for two of the good practices and\ninsolvency frameworks for Selected Countries recommendations and TA Obtain agreement from\nregional cooperation and recommendations governments and policy\nhandling of cross-border Conduct at least 3 makers, and participating\ninsolvencies regional conferences ADB participation & review organizations to attend\n(one per year) of proposed law reforms conferences/workshops\n(cid:129)  Facilitate regional Analyze and study the ADB dialogue with courts Reaching consensus on\ncooperation between courts Asian experience with and other institutions, recommendations, and\nand other competent structured informal conference preparation and accommodating national\nauthorities involved in workout processes progress reports requirements\nhandling both formal and\ninformal workouts and Expand the web site set Feedback from selected\nrestructurings up under TA 5795 to countries\ninclude TA materials\n(cid:129)  Review, on a Conduct at least two Consultants' reports and Informal processes are\ncomparative basis, informal regional workshops on feedback useful and necessary;\ninsolvency frameworks to informal insolvency and contribute to the\nfurther develop and processes and Consultants' report overall insolvency\nstandardize the informal restructurings frameworks in the region.\nprocess\n(cid:129)  Develop case studies Comparative review of Comparative studies and Case studies are\nand model frameworks to interrelationship between analysis relevant regionally.\nillustrate how an integrated secured transactions\napproach to secured laws and insolvency law\ntransactions and insolvency regimes (as applied)\nlaw reform can be\nimplemented\n(Reference in text:  page 1, para. 1)", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2\nDesign Summary PerformanceTargets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions/Risks\nOutputs\nModel frameworks for Consultants recruited Review of legal documents A common cross-border\nhandling cross-border Progress reports insolvency framework is\ninsolvency Qualified resource recognized by selected\npersons identified Detailed work plan and countries.\nterms of reference\nResource persons guide There is interest among\nADB review of interim selected countries in\nreports and dialogue with furthering understanding\nconsultants, participating of United National\norganizations Commission on\nInternational Trade Law\nWeb site improved to Web site implementation Review of Web site;

Hong Kong, China\nHong Kong, China adopted informal workout processes (Guidelines on Corporate Difficulties)\nduring the implementation of TA 5795 and is more advanced in terms of restructuring and\ninformal insolvency frameworks.  For comparative purposes, it will be included in the proposed\nTA.\nB.  India\nThe Government of India has formed a committee to review the need for insolvency law reform.\nIn  response  to  the  committee's  request,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided\ncomments and recommendations.  India will be invited to participate in the conferences to be\nheld under the proposed TA.\nC.  Indonesia\nIndonesia adopted an informal workout process during the Asian crisis (the Jakarta Initiative);\nformed agencies to handle debt restructuring (Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency [INDRA]\nand  the  Indonesian  Bank  Restructuring  Agency  [IBRA]);  and  is  currently  undertaking  a\ncomprehensive review of its insolvency laws. ADB is assisting in reviewing the proposed laws.\nA  meeting  in  Jakarta  was  proposed  by  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and\nDevelopment (OECD) for a detailed review of the draft laws, and the Office of the General\nCounsel (OGC) participated in this meeting (September 2000).    Many other aid agencies are\ninvolved in providing training to the judiciary, along with ADB under a TA associated with Loan\n1618-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program.  Given the will of the\nGovernment for reform, it was considered appropriate to include Indonesia in the proposed TA.\nD.  Japan\nIn 2000, Japan completed revising its century-old insolvency system, including provisions for\nextraterritoriality.  Under the proposed TA, the Japanese reform experience will be included for\ncomparative purposes.\nE.  Republic of Korea\nKorea issued guidelines for informal out-of-court workouts during the Asian financial crisis\n(Financial Institution Agreement for Promotion of Company Restructuring) and is in the process\nof a comprehensive review of its insolvency laws.  Republic of Korea is being assisted in this\nregard by the World Bank, among others. Officials of Republic of Korea\u2019s MOJ attended the\nsymposiums under TA 5795. In light of the ongoing reforms, it was considered beneficial to\ninclude Republic of Korea in the proposed TA.   Sharing with the selected countries will also be\nbeneficial for the Korean experience with informal workouts.\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 3)", "10\nAppendix 2, page 2\nF.  Malaysia\nDuring the Asian financial crisis, Malaysia adopted an informal workout process and formed a\ncommittee for the same (Corporate Debt Restructuring Agency).  It will be beneficial to review,\non a comparative basis, Malaysia\u2019s experience with informal workout processes, as well as to\nlearn from its cross-border experience with Singapore (personal bankruptcies only).\nG.  Pakistan\nThe economic law reform component of TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform identified the\nneed for insolvency law reform.  The work carried out under TA 5795 will be taken into account\nin  the  proposed  loans  for  Legal  and  Judicial  Reform  Program  and  the  Capital  Market\nDevelopment Program II.  Pakistan will be invited to participate in the conferences for the\nproposed TA.  Pakistan participated in the secured transactions TA.\nH.  Philippines\nThe  Philippines  recently  adopted  guidelines  for  handling  restructuring  and  suspension-of-\npayments cases by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  However, even more\nrecently, the SEC was stripped of its quasi-judicial functions, including the handling of such\ncases.  While jurisdiction over such cases has been handed to the civil courts, it is unclear what\nlaws the civil courts will be empowered to apply.  This is because the insolvency law (liquidation\nonly) has not been amended to include restructuring and is extremely out-of-date.  There is also\nthe issue of capacity building.  However, this country-specific activity is being taken up under a\nproposed TA for judicial training currently being processed by OGC, the World Bank and United\nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  (which  has  been  providing  considerable\nassistance and training to the SEC).  ADB has reviewed a draft of a new proposed insolvency\nlaw submitted to the Senate in July 2000.  It is probable that this draft will now be amended, and\na  new  bill  submitted  for  consideration  in  2001.    It  may  be  timely  to  include  cross-border\nprovisions for consideration at the same time.\nI.  Singapore\nSingapore has developed very comprehensive insolvency systems, including frameworks for\ninformal workout and conciliation.
