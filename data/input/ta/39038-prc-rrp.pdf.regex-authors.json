An environmental impact assessment was undertaken. \nAssessment  The summary was uploaded on the website of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on 18 February 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Project, in the middle of Heilongjiang province, is designed to \npromote sustainable economic growth by improving the Jixi\u2013Nehe \nhighway,  a  key  trunk  highway  in  the  northeast.  The  Project  will \ndevelop an integrated road network by upgrading 428 km of the Jixi\u2013\nNehe  provincial  highway  and  its  associated  170  km  of  rural  link \nroads. \n   \nRationale  Cutting across the province\u2019s middle through 11 counties, the 775 km \nJixi\u2013Nehe  corridor  is  a  major  route  connecting  the  eastern  and \nwestern  parts  of  the  northeast  region.  Despite  its  critical  role  in \nnetworking areas, more than a half of the corridor is either class-III or \n-IV highways, or gravel roads, all in poor condition. Some sections \nhave no drainage system and are impassable during winter or wet \nseasons. Traffic congestion due to poor road condition often causes \ntransport  costs  to  spiral.  Likewise,  the  expansion  of  economic \nactivities is severely hampered by poor transport conditions. The \nProject will upgrade about half of the Jixi\u2013Nehe highway. Forming \npart of the trunk network that is vital to economic development in the \nnortheast, the project highway will heighten transport efficiency and \nsafety, enhance the transport network in Heilongjiang, and improve \naccess to income-generating opportunities and social services. \n \nThe Project is a Government priority as it will help revitalize the \nnortheast region as an industrial hub, a key strategy in the 11th Five-\nYear Plan. The Government also assigns high priority to developing \nlocal roads to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in rural \nareas. The Project will receive ADB\u2019s first loan to upgrade provincial \nhighway and improve rural link roads to strengthen the local road \nnetwork. The Project will also help diversify ADB\u2019s operations in the \nPRC road sector. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nreduce poverty in Heilongjiang by (i) heightening transport efficiency \nand safety, (ii) enhancing the transport network by completing the \nJixi\u2013Nehe highway and integrating rural roads into the main highway, \nand (iii) improving access to income-generating opportunities and \nsocial services. \n ", "iv   \nThe Project will comprise (i) a main highway component\u2014upgrading \nor constructing five sections, totaling 428 km of class-III highways or \nunclassified roads to two-lane class-II or -I highways; (ii) a rural link \nroad component to strengthen the integrated network in the project \narea\u2014improving  22  sections  totaling  170  km;  (iii)  local  road \nmaintenance;  and  (iv)  equipment,  consulting  services,  capacity \ndevelopment, and land acquisition and resettlement.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is $524.55 million equivalent, including \ntaxes and duties of $11.98 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan   ($ million)\nSource  Total  % \n   \n    Asian Development Bank  200.0   38.1 \n    China Development Bank  148.8   28.4 \n    Ministry of Communications  102.7   19.6 \n    Heilongjiang Provincial Government  73.1   13.9 \n      Total  524.6   100.0 \n     \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $200 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nTerms  be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. Of the ADB loan, $15 million will finance \nthe rural link road component. \n   \nAllocation and  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to the Government, \nRelending Terms  which will, in turn, make the loan proceeds available to Heilongjiang \nprovincial government, on the same financial terms and conditions as \nthose of the ADB loan. The government will bear the interest rate \nvariation and foreign exchange risks. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department (HPCD)  \n   \nImplementation  The project implementation unit in HPCD will be the implementing \nArrangements  agency. It will coordinate and monitor the construction activities and \noperate  the  Project.  HPCD  will  implement  the  rural  link  road \ncomponent. \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. Civil works for the main highway component are divided \ninto 26 packages, all to be procured under international competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures. Civil works for the rural link roads are \ndivided  into  14  packages,  all  to  be  procured  under  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures (NCB). Equipment contracts valued ", "  v\nat $1 million or less may follow ICB, NCB, or limited international \nbidding as determined by the particular circumstances of the contract \npackages. Below $100,000, equipment procurement may follow the \nshopping  procedure.  Road  safety  facilities,  greening  work,  and \nancillary  facilities,  including  the  administration  building,  will  be \nprocured using NCB.  The international bidding will be conducted by \na qualified tendering company with experience in externally funded \nprojects. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be \nincluded in all documents and contracts related to project bidding \nand implementation. Advance action for procurement of civil works \nand retroactive financing were requested by the Government and \napproved  by  ADB.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  the \napproval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  7  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  for  resettlement,  socioeconomic  and  poverty \nimpact  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  asset  management  and \nmaintenance. The international consultants will be financed by the \nADB loan and recruited based on simplified technical proposals and \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. HPCD will engage and finance \nabout 4,900 person-months of domestic consultants, of which 300 \nperson-months will be allocated to the rural link road component and \nabout  50  person-months  to  monitoring  the  Project\u2019s  resettlement, \nsocioeconomic, and poverty impacts. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The improvement of the Jixi\u2013Nehe highway will promote economic \nBeneficiaries  growth  in  the  area  and  integrate  poor,  isolated  regions  with  the \ncenters of economic growth. Once linked to the major road network, \nthe  improved  rural  roads  will  facilitate  the  spread  of  the  project \nhighway\u2019s benefits to the rural economy. Improved transportation will \nincrease income opportunities from cash crop farming or seasonal \nwork involving migration, increase contact with urban centers, and \nease trips to markets and social services.  \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  road  users  such  as  transport \nproviders, bus and truck operators, passengers, traders, government \nofficials, and the private sector in general. Rural households in the \nproject area will also benefit. Farmers will have better access to \nmarkets.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is \nestimated at 21.0% and the financial internal rate of return for the \nproject  highway  component  at  6.5%,  higher  than  the  2.8%  real \nweighted average cost of capital. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  technical, \neconomic, financial, and social risks. To minimize the technical risk, \ninternational consultants carefully reviewed the proposed design and \nconstruction methods. The prequalification of contractors will focus \non their financial and technical capabilities in handling similar works. \nDuring  construction,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented  for  timely \nidentification of technical problems and implementation of corrective ", "vi   \nmeasures.  HPCD  has  a  proven  track  record  and  satisfactory \nperformance in implementing internationally financed projects. The \nfinancial risk associated with the construction and operation of the \nhighway will depend on the actual level and composition of traffic, the \nconstruction costs, the ability of the commercial management, and \nthe tolls charged. To control the financial risks, HPCD will create a \ncommercial business environment for highway maintenance, and the \ncentral and provincial governments will inject substantial equity into \nthe project roads. The social risks include resettlement and HIV/AIDS \ninfection. Mitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plan \nand social development action plan. \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Heilongjiang Road Network Development \nProject. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty reduction in recent decades. \nGDP has grown more than 9.0% per year since the 1980s, and the incidence of rural poverty fell \nfrom 33.0% in 1978 to just 2.8% in 2004. Sustained economic growth has resulted in an \nunprecedented expansion of traffic between and within provinces. The economy\u2019s changing \nstructure and increasing diversification have altered the pattern of transport demand, which has \noutpaced that for other modes of transport. The movement of goods and passengers by road, \nwhich  is  more  flexible  and  responsive  to  market  needs  than  other  modes  of  transport,  is \nincreasing rapidly. The shift in demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive restrictions \nin the road transport industry. Large investments in automotive manufacturing and the country\u2019s \nrapid economic growth spurred the expansion of vehicle fleets at a pace that will likely be \nmaintained in coming years. \n \n3.  Propelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  drastic  poverty  reduction  were  massive \ninvestments in roads. The Government has made major efforts to increase road capacity to \nmeet  the  growing  demand  for  improved  access  to  markets  and  services;  it  spent  about \nCNY2,000 billion on building new roads during the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP). As a result, the \nhighway network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.93 million km in 2005, for an average \nannual increase of 6%. Of these roads, 1.59 million km were classified. The total length of \nexpressways increased from 147 km in 1988 to 41,005 km in 2005. Class-I highways increased \nfrom 196 km in 1980 to 38,381 km in 2005, or 29% per year on average. Class-II and above \nhighways accounted for 328,500 km, or 15.5% of the total length. County, township, and village \nroads, which the Ministry of Communications (MOC) classifies as rural roads, totaled 2.9 million \nkm in 2005 (Appendix 2).  \n \n4.   The Government\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010), \ncalls for (i) the construction of 38,000 km of new roads to expand the total road network to 2.3 \nmillion km, of which, 25,000 km will be expressways, bringing the total length of expressways to \n65,000 km; (ii) the completion of the National Trunk Highway System; (iii) the completion of \ninterprovincial  western  development  corridors;  and  (iv)  the  completion  of  65\u201370%  of  the \nNational Expressway Network, with the total length reaching 55,000\u201360,000 km. \n \n5.  Even though rural roads play a huge role in poverty reduction, the rural road network, \nwhich accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s total road network of 3.3 million km, is underdeveloped \nin both extent and quality. Thus, the 30 million rural poor face significant challenges in relation \nto transport. Many live in isolated villages, which increase their transportation costs, thereby \nrestricting their access to basic goods and services. Most rural roads, especially in the west, are \nin poor condition because of deficient design and construction, inadequate maintenance, and \ndamage caused by overloaded vehicles. The roads\u2019 technical standards are low: only 11% are \nclass-III highways or above. Village roads are even worse, with merely 2% being rated class III \nor above. Only 20% of county roads, 15% of township roads, and 9% of village roads are paved. \nAbout 71% of rural roads are dirt roads that serve many townships and villages. These earth ", "2   \ntracks have no drainage system, making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassable \nduring the rainy season, preventing the rural poor from taking advantage of jobs created by \neconomic growth. \n \n6.  The 11th FYP assigns high priority to local road development to promote economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty in rural areas. By 2010, paved roads will link all eastern villages, \n80% of the central villages, and 90% of the western villages. The Government plans to invest \nCNY100 billion more to complete 1.2 million km of rural roads under the 11th FYP. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n \n7.  Despite the huge amount of investment, the road network still does not provide access to \nlarge parts of the country, particularly the poorer inland regions, and is inadequate to support \nsustainable economic growth. High-standard roads (above class II) account for only 15.5% of the \ntotal network. The remaining 80% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel roads (para. \n5). Expanding demand for road transport has strained road infrastructure, as manifested by \nbottlenecks in the network. The resulting high cost of shipping goods between inland provinces \nand ports has been a serious constraint. \n \n8.  Heilongjiang is in northeast PRC, bounded by the PRC\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion on the west, the Russian Federation on the north, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea on the east, and Jilin province on the south. Heilongjiang stands out for its fertile land and \nabundant natural resources. Of its 454,000 km2\u2014it is the sixth largest province\u201442% is forest, \nand its cultivated land area (9.7 million hectares) is the largest in the country. Heilongjiang\u2019s \npopulation in 2004 was 38.2 million, of which 53% was urban. The province was an industrial \nbase before the 1980s; its main sectors are petroleum, coal, power plant equipment, metallurgy, \nheavy machinery, special-tempered steel, timber, and woodworking. Foreign trade is vital to the \nprovince\u2019s economy; international and domestic demand for its products has consistently risen. \nDespite its strategic importance and economic potential, however, Heilongjiang has been left \nbehind by the coastal provinces since the 1980s. In 1982, its per capita GDP was about the \nsame as that of the coastal provinces (Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang). By 2004, \nHeilongjiang\u2019s GDP had dropped to merely 58% of theirs. The province\u2019s primary, secondary, \nand tertiary industries contribute 12%, 55%, and 33% of GDP. About half of the total labor force \nis absorbed by the primary industries, mainly agriculture and mining.  \n \n9.  The Project will upgrade or construct 428 km of the Jixi-Nehe highway. The 775-km Jixi-\nNehe highway, cutting across the middle of Heilongjiang through 11 counties, is a major route \nconnecting the eastern and western parts of the province. However, more than a half of the \ncorridor falls under class-III or -IV highways, or gravel roads, which are in poor condition. \nSections without any drainage system are impassable during winter or the wet season. Traffic \ncongestion due to poor road condition often causes transport costs to spiral. Likewise, the \nexpansion  of  economic  activities,  including  agricultural  and  industrial  trade,  is  severely \nhampered  by  poor  transport  conditions.  The  project  highway  will  upgrade  three  sections \nurgently needing improvement to two-lane class-I or -II standards and construct two new class-II \nsections1\u2014the missing links in the Jixi-Nehe corridor\u2014to strengthen integrated road networks in \nHeilongjiang, where poverty is high. \n                                                 \n1  One class II section is a 2.2 km bridge across the Songhua river to connect the mountainous Tonghe county to the \nexpressway network, and the other, a new 22 km road in Tonghe. ", "  3\n10.  The project highway will link Jixi city, a coal producer in the east, four forest counties in \nthe middle, and three agricultural counties in the west. The project highway will be connected \nwith one expressway, four national highways, and six provincial highways, forming part of the \ntrunk network that is vital to Heilongjiang and the northeast. Some sections of the roads that will \ncomprise the Project are clogged, carrying an average of 2,440 vehicles daily. Traffic in some \nsections has been growing at more than 12% annually in the past years. Overall, traffic on the \nproject roads will start growing at 8\u20139% yearly by 2014. The Project is expected to increase the \nnetwork\u2019s transport capacity and efficiency, catalyzing economic growth, spurring interregional \ntrade, and reducing poverty. \n \n11.  The project area has limited accessibility; its six counties and two cities, including two \npoverty-designated counties, are mostly rural\u201467% of 3.4 million people. In 2004, the per \ncapita rural income was CNY2,617, and the per capita GDP was CNY5,651, less than half the \nprovincial average of CNY13,897. The per capita urban income was CNY4,380. Above 18% of \nthe rural population is defined as poor, with annual per capita incomes below CNY900. Of the \n1,023 villages in the project area, 393 are poor. Rural people pay high rates for motorized \ntransport, have insufficient access to markets, and have little mobility beyond their immediate \ncommunities. The main causes of poverty include (i) limited road access to markets for farm \nproducts, (ii) the decline in the timber industry because of restrictions on tree cutting, (iii) \ninadequate road transport services, (iv) lack of skills and insufficient credit, and (v) natural \ndisasters.  \n \n12.  About 90% of the villages in the project area do not have adequate access to all-weather \nroads.  Poor  roads  have  resulted  in  inadequate  and  unaffordable  transport  services,  with \nlicensed bus and truck operators deterred from plying the routes to townships and villages. As a \nresult, many villages and townships have no direct bus service. Fares and routes of the formal \nbus system are regulated, often resulting in inefficient service. Villagers have to rely on informal \nmeans of transport such as bicycles, horse-drawn wagons, and motorized tricycles. Because \nthese are confined to services between villages and townships, they cannot replace the formal \ntransport system. As a result, the poor, who often have to walk to nearby rotating village \nmarkets, can sell only the produce that they can carry on their backs. A second option is selling \nto drive-in traders who thus have stronger bargaining power. \n \n2.  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n \n13.  In  November  2003,  the  Government  embarked  on  a  grand  plan  to  revitalize  the \nnortheast region\u2014including Heilongjiang\u2014as an industrial hub, thereby attaining and sustaining \neconomic  growth  of  over  10%.  MOC  drafted  the  northeast  regional  transport  network \ndevelopment plan in September 2004. The plan aims to construct an integrated road\u2013waterway \nnetwork in the region to catalyze economic development. In line with the plan, the Heilongjiang \nProvincial Communications Department (HPCD) launched the province\u2019s plan for 2005\u201320172 to  \nextend the improved trunk network to major ports to facilitate international and regional trade.3 \nThe improvement of the Jixi-Nehe highway is a priority project included in the plan. \n \n                                                 \n2  HPCD prepared the 30-year investment program in 1998 under ADB. 1994. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Provincial Highway Network Planning. Manila. The TA\u2019s outcome provided the basis of the \nprovincial implementation plan for 2005\u20132017. \n3  The key components are three radiate, four east\u2013west, and six south\u2013north highways, totaling 6,162 km. By the \ntime the network is completed in 2017, Heilongjiang will have 17,170 km of high-class highways. When the network \nis completed, an economic circle will be formed, centered at Harbin, the provincial capital. Eleven of the 13 cities or \ndistricts will be within 5 hours\u2019 drive from Harbin.  ", "4   \n14.  The 11th FYP assigns high priority to local road development to promote economic \ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  road  sector \nassistance will be broadened to finance non-expressways. The Project will receive ADB\u2019s first \nloan to upgrade provincial highway and improve rural link roads to strengthen the local road \nnetwork. The Project will also help diversify ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC road sector. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the PRC\u2019s road sector supports (i) the construction of \nroads that connect growth centers with hinterland economies; (ii) the integration of the network \nso that the national trunk highway system is supported by the local road networks, particularly \nthose that provide access to poor areas; (iii) the delivery of adequate and affordable transport \nservices;  (iv)  the  promotion  of  road  safety  and  the  reduction  of  vehicle  emissions;  (v)  the \nstrengthening  of  institutions  to  increase  financial  and  managerial  efficiency  in  expressway \noperation; (vi) the adoption of pricing policies to optimize road transport capacity; and (vii) the \nuse of alternative methods of investment financing, including private sector participation. The \nProject is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n \n3.  Opportunities \n \n16.  The Project will help revitalize the northeast region by completing the upgrading of the \nJixi-Nehe  highway,  a  key  project  included  in  the  northeast  regional  transport  network \ndevelopment  plan.  By  lowering  transport  costs  and  improving  the  frequency  and  level  of \ntransport services, the Project is expected to spur economic activity and interregional trade, \nthereby reducing poverty. The development of the road network will help transfer the benefits of \nthe coastal and eastern region\u2019s economic growth to the poor inland region. A rural link road \ncomponent has been integrated into the Project to improve the road network in the rural area. \nThis integrated approach will ensure that the Project benefits the poor and lower-income groups. \n \n17.  Evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB have confirmed that \nroad investments reduce poverty.4 Several ADB studies have also affirmed the relevance of \nADB\u2019s strategy, showing that road infrastructure has helped reduce poverty in the PRC not only \nby directly improving the lives of the poor but also by diversifying their sources of income and \nhelping increase their productivity. The findings of an ADB-funded technical assistance (TA)5 \nconfirmed that the road portfolio\u2019s geographic focus\u2014the poorer western interior provinces\u2014\nwas valid. The TA showed that complementary investments in local roads strengthen the impact \nof expressway investments. ADB has rigorously tried to identify road projects that focus sharply \non poverty reduction. \n \n18.  External assistance has helped the Government streamline its road sector strategy and \ninvestment projects, mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and \nthe World Bank. Since 1991, ADB has extended 32 loans totaling $6.4 billion to finance 4,455 \nkm of expressways and 8,366 km of associated local road networks. Since 1995, projects have \nincluded local roads to make ADB\u2019s interventions more pro-poor. Of the ADB-funded projects, \n18  have  already  been  completed  and  are  open  to  traffic.  ADB  has  also  supplied  54  TA \npackages totaling $28.3 million to the road sector. The advisory TA has addressed policy and \ninstitutional issues, including highway planning, road safety, human resources development, \nsocioeconomic  assessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

The World Bank has provided $6.6 billion and JBIC \u00a5219 billion to finance road \ninvestments. ADB coordinates with these organizations to ensure that each major development \npartner focuses on different corridors, and information related to policy advice is shared across \nthe development community (Appendix 3). \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n19.  HPCD  has  prepared  and  implemented  two  ADB-financed  road  projects  well.6 The \nsafeguard policies on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people7 have been \nimplemented.  Lessons  learned  from  projects  include  (i)  the  advantages  of  a  participatory \napproach to project preparation; (ii) the benefits of a well-coordinated resettlement schedule, \npreceded by consultations with the affected parties before their relocation; and (iii) the need for \ncareful geological investigation during the design stage to minimize contract variations. All these \nissues were taken into account during project preparation. Consultations with affected villagers \nwere emphasized from the start, and geological investigations carefully reviewed. \n \n20.  Performance reviews of completed ADB-financed road projects elsewhere in the PRC \nindicate  that,  in  general,  the  projects  facilitated  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  as \nenvisaged during project preparation. Completed projects show that (i) ADB\u2019s safeguard policies \nwere met; (ii) loan covenants were generally complied with; (iii) people\u2019s living standards were \nimproved  through  better  access  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social  services;  (iv)  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of ADB-financed roads were generally satisfactory; and (v) recent projects \nhelped raised policy makers\u2019 awareness of the importance of addressing key issues of road \nsafety and vehicle emissions. The performance audit reports for four road projects concluded \nthat they were either highly successful or successful. The lessons gleaned from ADB-financed \nroad projects are reflected in the design of the Project. To avoid delayed loan effectiveness \ncaused  by  late  procurement,  a  tendering  company  was  recruited  to  prequalify  civil  works \ncontractors.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and  requirements,  including  anticorruption \nprovisions, were discussed extensively during appraisal. Emphasis was put on the need to (i) \nstrictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-\napproved evaluation criteria, and (iii) clearly substantiate the conclusions of the bid evaluation. \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n \n21.  Transport Services in the Project Area. The rural poor benefit from a road project in \ndirect  proportion  to  their  access  to  reliable  and  affordable  transport  services,  which  are, \ntherefore, essential to strengthen the poverty impacts of road infrastructure. During project \npreparation, attention was given to the delivery of efficient, affordable, and sustainable transport \nservices. The project area comprises 6 counties and 2 cities, with 103 townships and 1,023 \nvillages. It has only 2 class-I bus terminals, and 5 class-II and 14 class-III bus stations. Many \nvillages and townships have no direct access to bus service; more than 85% of the villages do \nnot have even class-V rural bus stops. Expanding access to transport is a key strategy in the \n11th FYP. A class-III bus terminal in Fangzheng will be upgraded to class II, and 90 class-III bus \nstations and 160 bus stops will be constructed. By 2010, each township in the project area will \nhave one class-III bus station and 30% of the villages will have bus stops. HPCD will see to the \n                                                 \n6  They include the Jianmusi\u2013Harbin section of the Tongsan Expressway Project (approved in 1994) and the Harbin\u2013\nShuangcheng section of the Tongsan Expressway (approved in 1998). \n7  ADB. 2002.

", "6   \nimplementation of these facilities in tandem with the Project to ensure the efficient delivery of \ntransport services when the project roads are built (Appendix 4). \n \n22.  Small Business Development. To maximize the project benefits, attention has been \ngiven to spur small businesses and commercial activities. The TA survey8 shows that less than \n10%  of  the  people  run  small  businesses,  mainly  transportation,  groceries,  food  and  grain \nprocessing, trading of agricultural products, and eateries. Inadequate road infrastructure has \ngreatly hampered small businesses. The lack of skills, insufficient starter funds, limited access \nto marketing information, and inexperience also hinder local commerce. During the 11th FYP, \nthe  Heilongjiang  provincial  government  (HPG)  and  local  governments  will  pay  particular \nattention  to  the  establishment  of  a  wide  assortment  of  small  businesses  and  commercial \nactivities, which will provide communities with basic needs and jobs. The strategy is focused on \n(i) developing community-based enterprises such as agroprocessing, herbal and homeopathic \nmedicines, timber products, distribution and transport systems, hotels, and restaurants; (ii) \nconstructing roadside stations as focal points for small business development; and (iii) creating \nan  economic  zone  in  each  county,  specifically  targeting  small  businesses,  which  requires \ngovernment intervention to, for example, locate and group similar types of businesses. \n \n23.  The local governments will help communities set up small enterprises. In collaboration \nwith HPG, the eight county governments in the project area have prepared a plan to spur small \nenterprises. During the 11th FYP, CNY64 million will be pumped into 18 new factories; 56% of \nthe funds will come from the private sector. A township-owned paddy trading company will be \nestablished in Tieli county, and a village-owned refinery factory in Hailun county. The county \ngovernments will (i) allocate CNY8 million for a special-purpose loan that will help residents set \nup  small  businesses;  (ii)  provide  entrepreneurial  training  to  poor  local  residents;  and  (iii) \ncoordinate with cooperatives in providing small enterprises with assistance, such as information \ndistribution. Each county also plans to construct one roadside station along the project highway, \ncosting a total of CNY34 million. The construction of eight roadside stations and the birth of new \nenterprises will accelerate community development (Appendix 5). \n \n24.  Private Sector Participation. In the transport sector, the private sector\u2019s first activities \nare typically in highway construction, design, supervision, and periodic maintenance, through \ncooperative joint venture, securitization, and revenue-bond-financing and build-operate-transfer \ncontracts. The private sector also actively participates in contracted-out maintenance. However, \ntoll operation and private financing are difficult for the private sector to get into since it is difficult \nto reliably estimate traffic and toll revenues. In Heilongjiang, two sections were implemented \nusing build-operate-transfer: the 42-km Zhaodong\u2013Zhaozhou class-II highway and the 49-km \nHulan\u2013Lanxi  class-I  highway.  The  30-year  O&M  concession  was  awarded  to  a  private \ncompany.9 Profits amount to about 83\u201384% of toll revenues. Roads are maintained according to \nthe agreed standards, and maintenance is monitored annually by the provincial government. For \nthe project highway, HPCD will do its best to enter into an O&M concession for class-I roads \n(totaling 8 km), and pursue awarding a maintenance concession for the rest of the class-II roads \n(paras. 32\u201333). \n \n25.  Road Safety. In 2004, 41 deaths occurred per 10,000 vehicles\u2014high by international \nstandards. The Ministry of Public Security is committed to reducing accidents through improved \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Heilongjiang Road Network \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n9  The Guanyang Group, a private company, developed the 42 km Zhaodong\u2013Zhaozhou class-II section for CNY345 \nmillion. It also developed the 49 km Hulan\u2013Lanxi class-I section for CNY700 million. The Zhaodong\u2013Zhaozhou \nsection generates toll revenue of CNY16 million a year and the Hulan\u2013Lanxi section, CNY31 million. ", "  7\nvehicular safety, driver training, and traffic management. The Road Traffic Safety Law went into \neffect in May 2004. HPCD and the Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau are working together to \nfulfill the requirements of the new law and enhance road safety. A committee was established to \ndevelop and enforce nationwide regulations on overloaded trucks, including putting axle load \nlimits  on  roads.  Road  safety  concerns  associated  with  harsh  winter  weather  have  been \naddressed:  HPCD  has  designed  the  project  highway  using  several  ice  and  snow  control \nmeasures according to their design standards. Mixed traffic of high- and low-speed vehicles \nalong  the  project  highway  adds  a  safety  concern:  in  consultation  with  local  governments, \nshoulders of many sections of the project highway were widened while the detailed design was \nprepared to ensure the safety of low-speed farm vehicles and pedestrians.  \n \n26.  At least 6 months before the highway opens, HPCD will (i) implement a road safety \naction plan for the highway; and (ii) ensure, in collaboration with the Heilongjiang Public Security \nBureau, that a team of bureau personnel will patrol the highway and enforce the new law and \nregulations.  Some  20  person-months  of  consulting  services  from  a  domestic  road  safety \nspecialist will be engaged to help HPCD develop the road safety action plan and check designs \nand safety aspects of the project roads. A rural road safety zone in Qing\u2019an (2.5 km) will be \ncreated to ensure rural road safety along the project roads. In the zone, the local government \nwill follow the best practices to ensure rural road safety. The accident rate and traffic volume will \nbe monitored after the highway starts to operate, to verify the efficacy of the piloted safety zone \n(Appendix 6). \n \n27.  Vehicle  Emissions. The increasing number of vehicles has raised concerns about \nvehicle  emissions  and  air  pollution.  The  Government  has  taken  several  steps  to  control \nemissions: regulating the automobile industry, requiring an annual vehicle test, and drafting a \nvehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program.  The  new  measures  set  emission  and  fuel \nefficiency targets and offer tax incentives for manufacturers of environmentally friendly cars. \nHeilongjiang has vehicle emission standards, and the Heilongjiang Environmental Protection \nBureau (HEPB) regularly tests all types of vehicles. The Project will lessen air pollution, as \nvehicle emissions on the project roads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows. \nUpon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles on the project roads are \nestimated to be 30% lower than before the Project. Carbon dioxideemissions will be30% lower. \n   \nAt least 6 months before the highway opens, HPCD will provide ADB with (i) the regulations for \nvehicle emission limits and the penalties for violating emission standards; and (ii) the latest \ngovernment  plan,  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  new  standards  for  vehicle  emissions,  to \nimprove air quality in Heilongjiang, including cleaner fuel programs. With the assistance of \nconsulting services, HPCD and HEPB will develop and implement an action plan to control \nvehicle emissions (Appendix 6). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n28.  The  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in \nHeilongjiang  by  (i)  heightening  transport  efficiency  and  safety,  (ii)  enhancing  the  transport \nnetwork by improving the Jixi-Nehe highway and integrating rural link roads into the main \nhighway, and (iii) improving the access to income-generating opportunities and social services. \n \n \n ", "8   \nB.  Outputs \n \n29.  The Project will comprise (i) the upgrading of 428 km of the Jixi-Nehe highway, from \nclass III or unclassified to class II or I; (ii) the improvement of rural link roads, totaling 170 km, to \nstrengthen the integrated network in the project area; (iii) rural road maintenance; and (iv) \nequipment, consulting services, capacity development, and land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n30.  Rural  Link  Road  Component  To  strengthen  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of road \ninvestment, the policy dialogue between the Government and ADB focused on the need to \nintegrate rural road improvement into the project design. To expand the road network in rural \nvillages, the Project includes the improvement of rural link roads. The 22 sections of rural link \nroads, totaling 170 km, have been selected to link poor villages to the county center through the \nproject highway, thus favoring the poor in the benefit distribution. The sections are currently \nunclassified and will be upgraded to class IV under the Project. Of the $200 million ADB loan, \n$15 million is earmarked to finance the rural link road component (Appendix 7). Some 1.7 \nmillion people will benefit from the Project, of which 379,500 people in poor rural villages will \nbenefit from improved rural link roads. The rural link roads will (i) be upgraded concurrently with \nthe project highway, (ii) use Government design standards that are acceptable to ADB, (iii) \nfollow ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies, and (iv) be monitored for impact to the same degree as \nthe project highway. Some 300 person-months of domestic consultants will be allocated to this \ncomponent  to  ensure  proper  design  and  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nengineering staff training, and project management. \n \n31.  Rural Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability \nof rural roads, a job for which local administrative units are responsible. During the TA, the \nfollowing were examined: (i) planning of and standards for maintenance, (ii) funding sources, \nand  (iii)  monitoring  of  maintenance.  Maintenance  planning  often  hinges  on  subjective \nassessments, mainly because the local government lacks the resources to maintain its road \nnetworks. Local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, but periodic maintenance \nis budget-driven and lacks a systematic, preventive approach. The quality of rural roads does \nnot seem to be systematically monitored by the higher authorities. Considering the limited funds \nfor maintenance, a simple method for evaluating and prioritizing maintenance works must be \nestablished to streamline work programming and ensure effective fund use. During project \nimplementation, the HPCD will develop a sound road maintenance management system, which \nwill  (i)  set  up  measures  to  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii)  include  a  modern  method  of \nevaluation and maintenance prioritization for efficient work programming and fund use; (iii) \ninclude a compilation of road inventories and basic condition data; and (iv) have a monitoring \nsystem to be used by the residents. One person-month of international consulting services and \n3 person-months of domestic consulting services will be engaged. Based on the output of an \nADB  TA,10 in  addition,  the  HPCD  will  develop  a  province-specific  rural  road  maintenance \nmanual by 2007, with the assistance of 15 person-months of domestic consulting services. A \ntraining program will be provided to strengthen the capacity of local governments (Appendix 8). \n \n32.  Operation and Maintenance Concession. O&M improves substantially when handled \nby the private sector. An O&M concession is an agreement between a government or a state \nenterprise and a private enterprise, whereby the private enterprise maintains the road according \nto agreed standards and collects tolls from users that finance the maintenance and reward the \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Rural Road Development Strategy. Manila. ", "  9\nconcessionaire.  Under  an  O&M  contract,  the  concessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  risk  and, \nultimately, the revenue risk. Heilongjiang has so far attempted to offer O&M concessions for \nthree expressways: Jiamusi\u2013Harbin, Shangzhsi\u2013Harbin, and Daqing\u2013Harbin. However, none \nwas successful, mainly because of the traffic and revenue risks. Private investors thought that \ntraffic  forecasts  were  overly  optimistic  and  proposed  toll  rates  that  were  relatively  high \ncompared with the economic level. The current toll-setting process does not reflect demand \nmanagement.11 These factors often discourage all but a few private investors from bidding. \nHPCD will allocate $200,000 of the ADB loan for a study on how to strengthen domestic \ncapacity to tackle the problem and how to facilitate awarding O&M concessions to the private \nsector. \n \n33.  Upon project completion, HPCD will do its best to award an O&M concession for the \nclass-I section (totaling 8 km) and a maintenance concession for the rest (class-II roads).12 The \n8-km section is strategically located in the corridor. Comprising a 2.63-km bridge and a 5.37-km \nclass-I highway, the section is a major river crossing, with few nearby practical alternatives. Its \nphysical  characteristics  make  the  section  attractive.  The  efficiency  gain  from  an  O&M \nconcession to the private sector for the 8-km section will boost the other sections\u2019 efficiency. \nHPCD and ADB will make sure that (i) the concession is adequately priced by awarding it \nthrough competitive bidding; (ii) bidding for the concession is transparent to maximize the gain \nof the concession to the efficiency in the operation; and (iii) the maintenance of the project roads \nwill meet the agreed standards. HPCD will submit the bidding documents and the concession \nframework to ADB for review by 2008. \n \n34.  Stakeholder Consultations. During the preparation of the feasibility study, environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  and  resettlement  planning  consultations  were  conducted  with \ngovernment agencies, villagers, local groups, and other people likely to be affected by the Project, \nto discuss environmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement, and economic development \npotential. Village investigations and surveys were conducted to assess the Project\u2019s potential \nadverse effects and benefits. Over 2,400 people were interviewed during public opinion surveys, \nsocial and environmental assessments, and resettlement planning. For the resettlement plan, \nconsultation meetings were held with representatives of affected counties, townships, and villages. \nRural people were familiar with the Project and public support for it was high. Local officials \nexplained the compensation policies and regulations to those who would lose their farmland or \nhousing. The consultation was expanded to finalize the design and formulate compensation \nstandards  and  rehabilitation  measures  for  people  displaced  by  land  acquisition  or  house \ndemolition. Villagers participated in the discussions and decisions on resettlement (Appendix 9). \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n35.  The project investment is estimated at $524.55 million, including taxes and duties of \n$11.98 million (Appendix 10). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 Even under a concession arrangement, toll setting requires approval of the price bureau. \n12 Under PRC law, the provincial government retains the operating rights to roads that are ranked as class II or lower. \nThus, only a maintenance concession will be awarded to the private sector for the rest of the highway.

Financing Plan \n \n36.  The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Of the ADB \nloan, $15 million will finance the rural link road component, with the remaining costs to be \ncovered by the fund to be raised by provincial and county governments. HPCD has committed \nto ensuring the implementation of these roads during the project period. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n37.  MOC  and HPG will provide 33.5% of the project costs on a grant basis. The MOC grant \nwill amount to $102.7 million and the HPG grant to $73.1 million. The China Development Bank \nwill provide a $148.8 million loan on a 20-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, at an \ninterest rate of 6.12%. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to the Government, which \nwill, in turn, make the  loan proceeds available to HPG,  on the same financial terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. HPG will bear the interest rate variation and foreign \nexchange risks. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  11\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total  % \n     \nAsian Development Bank  200.0   38.1 \nChina Development Bank  148.8   28.4 \nMinistry of Communications  102.7   19.6 \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government  73.1   13.9 \nTotal  524.6   100.0 \n         Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management \n \n38.  HPCD will be the Executing Agency, responsible for implementing the Project. The \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  HPCD  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the  highway\u2019s \nconstruction activities and operate the highway. Its general manager, the project director, will be \nresponsible for overall project management in relation to the highway, approval of contracts, \nand payments. HPCD will implement the rural link road component. PIU will facilitate land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  local \nconcerns are addressed adequately. PIU will be headed by a project manager, who will oversee \nday-to-day physical implementation activities and prepare progress reports. Besides its central \noffice, PIU will have nine toll stations and eight maintenance centers. HPCD has sufficient \ntechnical  capability  to  implement  the  Project,  but  its  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be \nstrengthened  in  some  areas  such  as  asset  management  and  maintenance,  monitoring  of \nresettlement, and socioeconomic and poverty impact. Assistance will be provided under the \nconsulting services. \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n39.  Preconstruction  activities\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \nprequalification of contractors, and tendering and awarding of contracts\u2014began in October \n2005. Preconstruction activities are targeted for completion in September 2006. Preliminary \ndesign was completed in November 2005 and detailed design, in April 2006. The Project will be \nimplemented over about 4 years, from September 2006. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 11. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n40.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works for \nthe  main  highway  component  are  divided  into  26  packages,  all  to  be  procured  under \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). Civil works for the rural link roads are divided into 14 \npackages, all to be procured under national competitive bidding (NCB). Equipment contracts \nvalued at $1 million or less may follow ICB, NCB, or limited international bidding as determined \nby the particular circumstances of the contract packages. If below $100,000, equipment may be \nprocured under the shopping procedure. Road safety facilities, greening work, and ancillary \nfacilities,  including  the  administration  building,  will  be  procured  using  NCB.  Procurement \npackages are provided in the procurement plan (Appendix 12). International bidding will be \nconducted by a qualified tendering company with experience in externally funded projects. The ", "12  \nrelevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts \nrelated to project bidding and implementation.  \n \n  4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n41.  HPCD started preparing project tender and bid documents for civil works in April 2006, \nand the contracts are expected to be awarded in August 2006. Because project preparation was \nadvanced, ADB approved HPCD\u2019s request for advance procurement action for civil works and \nretroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB \nloan) incurred in relation to civil works from 10 May 2006 up to the loan effectiveness, or a \nmaximum of 12 months before the signing of the loan, whichever was later. The Government \nhas been advised that ADB approval of advance procurement action and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project. Contracts proposed for retroactive financing will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n  5.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  The Project will finance 7 person-months of international consulting services: 6 person-\nmonths for resettlement, socioeconomic, and poverty impact monitoring and evaluation; and 1 \nperson-month for asset management and maintenance. HPCD will engage and finance around \n4,900 person-months of national consultants, 300 person-months of which to be allocated to the \nrural link road component and about 50 person-months to monitoring the Project\u2019s resettlement, \nsocioeconomic, and poverty impacts. The international consultants will be financed by the ADB \nloan and recruited based on simplified technical proposals and the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  national \nconsultants will be financed from domestic resources and will be recruited in accordance with \ngovernment procedures acceptable to ADB. HPCD will establish seven resident supervision \nengineer offices for construction supervision, environmental and resettlement monitoring, and \nproject performance monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n43.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.13 \nBecause most of the payments will be made for large contracts (above $100,000 equivalent), \ndirect payments, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw loan \nfunds. To facilitate disbursement for small expenditures, HPG will establish an imprest account \nat a bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by \nappropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services are produced in and procured \nfrom ADB members, and eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into the \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  $3,000,000.  If  government  funds  are  used  for  eligible \nexpenditures, ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure will be followed. To expedite the flow of funds, \nthe statement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures for any \nindividual payment not exceeding $200,000 equivalent. \n \n  7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n44.  HPCD will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project and related financial \nstatements. The project accounts and financial statement will be established and maintained in \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. ", "  13\naccordance with sound accounting principles and practices as prescribed by the Accounting \nLaw of the PRC, consistently applied by external auditors whose qualifications, experience, and \nterms of reference are acceptable to ADB. To ensure that internal controls and checks on the \nproject construction costs and operations are effective, HPCD will establish an internal audit unit \nand will maintain it during project implementation and operation. The unit will independently test \nday-to-day transactions before referring them to external auditors. The project accounts and \nannual financial statements will be subject to annual external audit, which will be carried out in \naccordance with the State Council-approved regulations for auditing (1993) and meet ADB \nrequirements. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the loan \nproceeds  and  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants  included  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements. HPCD will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year the \nProject\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, audited project accounts, audit reports, and \nmanagement letters in English. HPCD will submit quarterly progress reports. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, HPCD will submit a project completion report to ADB, providing details about \nimplementation,  actual  costs  incurred  in  relation  to  cost  estimates,  benefits,  and  other \ninformation that ADB may request. \n \n  8.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy14 was explained to and discussed with the Government, \nHPG, and HPCD. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. Provisions of the \nanticorruption policy are included in the loan regulations and the project bidding documents. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. HPCD will (i) \nestablish  a  supervisory  body  to  prevent  interference  in  business  practices,  with  adequate \nresources made available for its effective operation; (ii) involve a leading group of officials from \nHPCD\u2019s Supervision Division in project bidding, construction, and other operational activities; \n(iii) hold regular briefings between HPCD and the Prosecutor's Office to share information on or \nwarnings about any corrupt practices detected; (iv) periodically inspect contractors\u2019 activities in \nrelation to fund withdrawals and settlements ; and (v) introduce a dual signing system whereby \nthe civil works contract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer. \n \n  9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n46.  To  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance to stakeholders, ADB uses the project performance management system. The \nmonitoring will focus on a few key representative communities. A basic monitoring framework \nwas constructed for the Project to permit a more definitive assessment of the actual benefits. \nHPCD has concurred with (i) the monitoring framework, (ii) the set of indicators to be used for \nmonitoring and evaluating the Project\u2019s impacts, and (iii) the selection of the eight representative \nvillages in the project area. The indicators were selected based on the findings of an ADB-\nfinanced  TA  (footnote  5).  The  baseline  values  for  the  indicators  were  established,  where \navailable, during project preparation, and will be updated at project inception. The indicators will \nbe measured at project completion and biennially for 6 years after completion. The poverty and \nsocioeconomic impact monitoring tasks will require 6 person-months of international expertise to \ndefine the monitoring framework and to train domestic consultants in monitoring methodology; \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. Manila. ", "14  \nand  50  person-months  of  domestic  expertise  in  database  management,  village  surveys, \nanalysis, and reporting, for which HPCD will recruit an independent local institute by 2007. The \nproject highway and rural link roads will be given the same degree of attention as regards \nimpact monitoring. HPCD and local governments have assured ADB that monitoring in the \nselected communities will be adequately carried out (Appendix 13). \n \n  10.  Project Review \n \n47.  In 2008, ADB and HPCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project, focusing on \npolicy, institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, \nfinancial,  and  other  factors  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  Project\u2019s  performance  and \ncontinuing viability. The review will examine progress in resettlement and compliance with \nassurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n48.  Based on the origin-destination and traffic count surveys, the 428-km provincial highway \nwas divided into five sections for the traffic forecast. The associated rural link roads, totaling 170 \nkm, were assigned to the corresponding highway sections to form five separate networks. The \naverage distance between two points along the highway was a major factor in the sectional \ndivision. The location of the alignment as regards altitude and existing road conditions was also \nconsidered. Normal, diverted, and generated traffic were then forecast for each network. The \nforecast average annual daily traffic on the project highway is 1,752\u20133,939 vehicles in 2010, \nwhen  the  Project  begins  operation;  3,920\u20137,636  in  2020;  and  7,549\u201312,979  in  2029.  The \nprojections consider (i) the growth in traffic during the past 10 years, (ii) the traffic generated by \nexpanded economic activities, (iii) the likelihood that existing traffic will be diverted to the \nhighway once it is operational, and (iv) the traffic survey (Appendix 14). \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n49.  The economic evaluation was carried out using highway design and maintenance. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project highway was estimated by comparing the \nproject case for 20 years after improvement, with a base case involving the continued use and \nmaintenance of the existing road. Without the Project, congestion would increase, resulting in \ndelays, higher vehicle operating cost (VOC), and more accidents. The Project, with its reduced \ntravel distance and travel time, safer design, and better road conditions, will reduce VOC and \naccident risks. Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2005 prices, expressed in yuan and \nemploying the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign \nexchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to \nunskilled labor, but not on the wages paid to skilled labor, because no skilled worker surplus \nexists. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an \neconomic opportunity cost of labor. The economic costs include (i) capital, including physical \ncontingencies, land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation; and (ii) highway \nO&M, including replacing depreciated equipment. The land acquisition and resettlement costs \nwere  based  on  their  opportunity  costs:  the  agricultural  output  forgone  and  the  re-siting  of ", "  15\ndisplaced activities.15 The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOC resulting from the \nreduced travel distance and improved roads, (ii) savings in passengers\u2019 time and time of freight \ntied up in transit, and (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents. \n \n50.  An EIRR was calculated for each network. The EIRR for the five road sections swings \nfrom 15% to 26%, with a consolidated EIRR of 21%. The net present value (NPV) calculated for \neach project section ranges from CNY363 million to CNY1.4 billion. The consolidated NPV for \nthe five road sections amounts to CNY4.6 billion. The results of sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability: changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, \nbenefits, and a 1-year delay in project completion\u2014do not significantly affect its economic \nviability (Appendix 15). \n \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n \n51.  Heilongjiang  is  applying  unified  toll  rates  to  all  class-II  highways  according  to  the \nprovincial government\u2019s policy, which are about 30% lower than the rate for expressways. The \nassumed toll rates for the main highway are considered reasonable to attract sufficient traffic to \nmeet the criteria for the financial rate of return (FIRR).16 HPCD will consult ADB on a proposed \ninitial toll rate scheme 6 months before the highway opens. The scheme will be evaluated based \non (i) the toll levels on similar highways in the province, (ii) affordability, (iii) historical and actual \ntraffic flows, (iv) advantages to the users of the highway, and (v) debt service ability. HPCD will \nreview the toll annually and monitor actual traffic levels and financial performance. Financial \nprojections prepared for the highway in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB17 assessed  the \nfinancial viability and sustainability (Appendix 16). The projected financial statements indicate \nthat financial revenues will be sufficient to absorb O&M costs, income taxes, and debt service. \nThe financial evaluation of the highway used constant 2005 prices. The Project\u2019s cost estimates \nand financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the \nprojected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. The FIRR for the \nproject highway is estimated at about 6.5% after taxes, higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.8%, also net of taxes. The highway is considered to be both financially viable and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions \n(Appendix 17). \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n52.  The project area covers six counties, of which two are poor by national and provincial \nstandards, and two cities. It had 3.4 million people as of 2004, of whom 2.3 million lived in rural \nareas. The project highway passes through 1,023 administrative villages, of which 393 (38.4%) \nare poor. Of the rural population, 391,600 (17.0%) earn an annual per capita income of less \nthan CNY1,300. Of the urban population of 1.1 million, 92,700 (8.4%) are poor. Once linked to \nthe major road network, the improved rural link roads will spread the benefits to the townships \nand villages, including more income opportunities from cash crop farming or seasonal work \n                                                 \n15\n The economic opportunity costs of land were assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, \nwhich was calculated for land compensation. No additional opportunity cost for land was assumed, because all the \nland is in rural areas. \n16 In Heilongjiang, the toll is set at levels that allow the recovery not only of the O&M cost but also the cost of capital. \nFor the class-II Harbin\u2013Jiamusi highway, funded by ADB, tolls for passenger, medium-sized, and large trucks were \nCNY0.37, CNY0.53, and CNY0.72. Some 88\u201390% of toll revenues were used to repay loans, the rest for O&M.  \n17 ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. ", "16  \nrequiring migration, more contact with urban centers, and improved access to markets and \nsocial services (Appendix 18). HPCD prepared a social development action plan in collaboration \nwith the local governments. This plan includes measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts \nand to enhance the Project\u2019s benefits to the poor, women, and ethnic minorities (Appendix 19). \n \n53.  About  22,781  people  in  the  project  area  (0.7%  of  the  total  population)  are  ethnic \nminorities,  mainly  Chaoxian  and  Manchu.  The  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  are \ninsignificant (para. 55). The Chaoxian are generally better off than the Han, and the Manchu live \nin scattered settlements. The TA concluded that the minorities will benefit from the Project in a \nmanner that is compatible with their cultural traditions. Minorities belonging to vulnerable groups \nwill get special assistance in economic rehabilitation, and priority for career training. All affected \nminorities will be relocated in the original villages. The Project will give women greater access to \ninformation and jobs. Female migrant workers in search of work will find it easier to travel to \nurban centers. Women will benefit from increased marketing opportunities and from better \naccess to higher-quality education and health facilities. Women will be encouraged to participate \nin project implementation and monitoring and in resettlement and social development. Women \nare entitled to equal opportunity and pay in jobs under the PRC Labor Law and will receive \npreferential treatment in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development.18 \n \nE.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n54.  The resettlement plan was prepared based on the preliminary design, village surveys, \nhousehold surveys, local government statistics, and consultations with local officials and project-\naffected people. The Project will affect 6 counties, 2 cities, 36 townships, 130 administrative \nvillages, 6 forest bureaus, and 24 forest stations. It will require the relocation of 66 urban and \n135  rural  households,  of  which  only  a  few  are  ethnic  minorities.  About  1,391  ha  will  be \npermanently  acquired,  of  which  38%  are  cultivated  and  44%  forest.  Using  PRC  planning \nstandards, land acquisition will be equivalent to the full loss of land of about 1,600 people. A \ntotal of 14,589 m2 of residential structures will be demolished, requiring the relocation of 226 \nurban and 576 rural people.  \n \n55.  The resettlement plan was formulated in accordance with the PRC\u2019s laws and local \nregulations and with ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous people (footnote \n7). The impact on villages is modest because farms in Heilongjiang are large. Only eight village \ngroups will lose about 5% of their farmland. Special measures will be taken to assist 659 poor \nhouseholds, 11% of the total affected. House relocation will be completed ahead of time; \nhousehold plots will be provided within the same village. Compensation will be paid before \ndisplacement of people or loss of land and will be invested in economic and social infrastructure \nto improve farmers\u2019 livelihoods and living standards. Economic rehabilitation strategies have \nbeen  discussed  with  the  eight  most  seriously  affected  village  groups.  The  cost  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement is CNY313 million, including contingencies, which anticipate an \nincrease in compensation rates because of the application of new consolidated standards. \nHPCD distributed an information booklet to the affected villages and households in February \n2006 (Appendix 20).  \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment \n \n56.  ADB has classified the Project under environmental category A. The EIA report for the \nmain highway was prepared by HPCD and approved by HEPB in January 2006. The EIA for the \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2003. ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. ", "  17\nSonghua River Bridge was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration on 4 \nApril  2006.  HPCD  ensured  that  the  Project  was  designed  and  would  be  constructed  and \noperated in accordance with government rules and regulations and ADB\u2019s environment policy \n(footnote 7). HPCD will implement the environment management plan (EMP) set out in the EIA \nand  the  summary  EIA  to  mitigate  any  environmentally  adverse  project  impacts;  mitigation \nmeasures will be incorporated in the bidding documents and civil works contracts. The EIA \nassessed the environmental impacts of the selected alignment of the main highway and the \nrural  link  roads  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures.  The \nproposed alignment does not cross or impinge on any protected areas; there are no known rare \nor endangered species in the project area. The Project\u2019s major environmental impacts include \nsoil and water conservation and erosion control. A soil erosion prevention plan was prepared \nseparately. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n57.  The Project has been designed to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and \nsocial risks. To minimize the technical risk, international consultants reviewed the proposed \ndesign and construction methods. The prequalification of contractors will focus on their financial \nand technical capabilities in handling similar works. During construction, monitoring and contract \nmanagement information systems will be set up and implemented to identify and solve technical \nproblems. HPCD  has  a  proven  track  record and  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  The  financial  risk  associated  with  the  construction  and \noperation  of  the  highway  will  depend  on  the  actual  level  and  composition  of  traffic,  the \nconstruction costs, the ability of the commercial management, and the tolls charged. To control \nthe  financial  risks,  HPCD  will  create  a  commercial  business  environment  for  highway \nmaintenance, and the central and provincial governments will inject substantial equity into the \nproject roads. The social risks include resettlement and HIV/AIDS. Mitigation measures are in \nplace in the resettlement plan and social development action plan. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.

The road network in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was 1.93 million km in 2005. \nOf this, 1.59 million km were classified. Highways of class II and above accounted for 15.5% of \nthe total length. The road density was 20.0 km per 100 km2 in 2005. In 2004, rural roads totaled \n2.9 million km in 2004: county\u2014479,372 km; township\u2014945,180 km; and village\u20141,473,534 \nkm. Heilongjiang\u2019s road network made up only 3.6% of the country\u2019s total network in 2004, with \na total length of 68,821 km. Of this, 61,304 km were classified: expressways\u2014722 km; class I\u2014\n1,040 km; class II\u20147,034 km; and classes III and IV\u201452,508 km. Road density was 1.61 km \nper 1,000 people. By administrative standards, national, provincial, and village roads comprise \n7.5%, 12.2%, and 80.3%.  \n \n2.  In 2004, the PRC had 26.9 million trucks, cars, and buses. The private fleet increased \nfrom 0.28 million in 1985 to 14.8 million in 2004. Modernizing the vehicle fleet will improve \nvehicle  safety  and  reduce  individual  vehicles\u2019  fuel  consumption  and  emissions.  In  2004, \nHeilongjiang had more than 48,300 bus operators, most small and private, on routes shorter \nthan 150 km. About 79,000 buses were registered, including 14,000 large buses with a total \ncapacity of 300,000 seats, with average growth of 4.8% over the last 10 years. Road passenger \ntraffic in passenger-km grew 11.3% per year in 1990\u20132004, faster than the national average of \n9.0%. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew at 9.2% per year, compared with 6.2% per year for \nthe PRC as a whole.  \n \n3.  The Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department regulates the road transport \nindustry by licensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. Freight transport is essentially \nderegulated, but interprovincial bus routes require Ministry of Communications approval. Private \noperations  have  increased,  improving  transport  efficiency  and  quality  and  increasing \ncompetition. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or minus 20% of advisory \ntariffs set by the local government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of market entry, will \nfacilitate the passing on to transport users of cost reductions resulting from improved roads. \n \n4.  Expenditures  for  highways  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges,  government \ngrants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two dedicated user \ncharges, the road maintenance fee and the vehicle purchase fee, have provided much of the \nfinancing  for  the  road  sector.  During  2001\u20132005,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle \npurchase fee provided 3.1\u20136.8% and 9.9\u201311.5% of total road investments in the PRC, and 4.6% \nand 8.3% of total investments in Heilongjiang. Road projects are designed by planning and \ndesign  institutes  at  the  provincial,  prefecture,  and  county  levels.  The  Ministry  of \nCommunications reviews the designs of high-standard roads and associated structures. Design \ninstitutes are staffed with well-qualified personnel. City and county highway bureaus have their \nown  construction  units  to  carry  out  minor  projects  within  their  administrative  districts. \nCompetitive bidding practices were mandated by the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. Road \nmaintenance  is  well  organized  and  implemented  by  expressway  companies  and  highway \nadministration bureaus.  \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank has been undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road \nsector since 1991. The principal issues include the impact of road projects on poverty, design \nstandards,  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies, \ncommercialization and corporatization, and nongovernment financial resources. The sector\u2019s \nstatus and achievements to date are summarized in the following table.

29\nTRANSPORT SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA \n \nA.  Transport Facilities and Plan \n \n1.  The rural poor benefit from a road project in direct proportion to their access to reliable \nand affordable transport services, which are, therefore, essential to strengthen the poverty \nimpacts of road infrastructure. The project area comprises 6 counties and 2 cities, with 103 \ntownships, and 1,023 villages. The project area has only 2 class-I bus terminals, and 5 class-II \nand 14 class-III bus stations. Many villages and townships have no direct access to bus service; \nmore than 85% of the villages do not have even class-V rural bus stops. Expanding the access \nto transport services is a key strategy in Heilongjiang\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, under which a \nclass-III bus terminal in Fangzheng county will be upgraded to class II, and 90 class-III bus \nstations and 160 bus stops will be constructed. By 2010, each township in the project area will \nhave one class-III bus station and 29% of the villages will have bus stops. \n \nB.  Transport Services Providers \n \n2.  Many types of vehicles operate on the project roads, depending on accessibility and \nroad surface types. The project highway from Linkou to Baiquan does not provide continuous \nand consistent transport services mainly because of a missing link between Tonghe and Tieli. \nBuses provide passenger transport from Tieli to Tonghe. A bus company in Tieli plies different \nroutes, including the route to Tonghe. The company deploys eight buses a day on this route, for \nwhich the fare is CNY13 per passenger one way.  On the 180 km Tieli\u2013Hailun route, the \ncompany fields only one bus, charging CNY25 per passenger. There are 1,147 trucks operating \nin Tieli, which has a total of 5,067 vehicles. \n \n3.  The  absence  of  a  bridge  over  the  Songhua  river  hampers  traffic  flow  between \nFangzheng and Tonghe and beyond. Ferries operate 24 hours a day in the summer, spring, and \nautumn. A floating bridge is built over the ice during winter. The river carries 400\u2013500 vehicles a \nday\u2014cars, buses, trucks, and tractors. The maximum capacity of a ferry is 20 cars or 15 trucks, \nbut actual loaded vehicles often exceed the maximum limit. It takes 10 minutes for a ferry to \ncross the river. The waiting time for loading and unloading is half an hour each. The one-way \nfare is CNY30 for cars, CNY70 for buses, and CNY200 for trucks. There are 1,800 operating \nvehicles  in  Linkou  county,  650  of  which  are  passenger  vehicles  with  7,000  seats.  Of  the \npassenger vehicles, 229 are buses, which transport 2.2 million passengers per year, or about \n6,000 passengers per day. Business activity peaks from July to October, and buses operate \nwith 30% standees. The tariff is CNY0.17/passenger/km but could rise to 22% on bad roads. \nThe passenger load is expected to rise as rail transport services become scarcer in some low-\npopulated counties. \n \n4.  In Linkou county, 1,160 trucks with different load capacities transport grain, corn, and \nbeans. Trucks transport 10,000 m3 of wood per year outside the county. The tariff is CNY0.3\u2013\nCNY0.5/ton/km. Large trucks are used: two drivers man one vehicle and work round-the-clock. \nLarge trucks travel over 100,000 km per year. In Hailun, two passenger transport companies \nemploy 2,400 people. One firm has 50 buses\u201414 high quality, 23 middle level, and 13 village \nlevel. The other company owns 180 buses that go to various destinations, including Harbin. Bus \nregulation, which controls the number of units operating on routes and the ticket prices, will \nharm competition, creating supply shortages. Meanwhile, freight vehicles are not regulated on \ntheir tariffs or axle loads. Trucks haul agricultural produce to various destinations. In 2004, the \ncounty produced 0.6 million tons of agricultural produce, of which 60% was transported to \ndifferent markets, including Beijing and Harbin, mainly by rail because of poor road transport \nand high tariffs. Baiquan is a grain store of Heilongjiang, producing corn, rice, and vegetables ", "30  Appendix 4 \nfor different markets. Limited transport services, however, prevent the surplus from reaching \ncompetitive  markets  despite  high  demand.  Three  roads  in  Baiquan  connect  7  townships, \nencompassing 84 villages; 150 buses operate on these roads. Fares are CNY 0.17\u2013CNY0.21 \nper person per km, depending on bus quality. Freight rates are CNY0.45\u2013CNY0.48/ton/km, \ndepending on road conditions. \n \nC.  Local Needs for Transport  \n \n5.  It is operators who propose new bus routes, and local transport administration divisions \ndo not undertake overall planning for the route network. In the project area, although some \ntrucks and buses ply the villages, service is limited by poor roads. Villagers without transport \nhave to rely on informal means of transport to go to their township bus station. The technical \nassistance survey found that the average trip for the poor was longer than that for those better \noff because villages are far from commercial centers. Such trips are costly, uncomfortable, and \ninfrequent. As a result, the poor, who often have to walk to nearby rotating village markets, can \nsell only the produce that they can carry on their backs. A second option is selling to drive-in \ntraders who thus have stronger bargaining power. \n \n6.  Most trips cover short distances: about 70% of all trips are within the township. Trips to \nthe county town are rare, with the average household making only 10 trips per year, and the \npoorest group, less than two trips. Demand for long-distance travel comes mostly from migrant \nworkers, who are employed in the center cities or coastal provinces and return home once a \nyear.  Most  trips  are  for  buying  necessities,  while  only  12%  are  for  agricultural  marketing. \nWalking and bicycling are the major modes of transport for short-distance trips. As distance \nincreases, so does the number of motorized trips; almost no trips are made on foot when the \ndistance exceeds 6 km.  \n \nD.  Transport Services and Road Condition \n \n7.  The area\u2019s inadequate and insufficient transport services are highly correlated with poor \nroad condition. The technical assistance survey revealed that areas with better roads have more \ntransport services, which makes travel to markets or social facilities easier and more frequent. \nIn Tieli city, where the road network is good, transport services are relatively well developed, \nimplying that transport services improve along with road networks. The interviewed operators \nsaid they were willing to extend transport services where profitable, and villagers who have \nexperienced road upgrading said that bus services were indeed extended after a road was \nupgraded. The village survey confirmed a close link between road access and the quality of \ntransport service.  \n \n8.  The villagers said that when roads were improved, the service improved, while official \nfares and trucking rates did not decrease since licensed bus operators were often constrained in \nsetting fares. In many cases, however, informal transport fares went down. The demand for \ntravel also increases significantly as roads improve, mainly because of upgraded transport \nservices, which eventually help raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. The village survey \nindicated that the average number of trips in such areas is higher than in areas with less \ndeveloped roads. The survey showed that poor farmers who rarely use roads also benefit from \nimproved roads as a result of better quality of transport services by way of higher farm-gate \nprices for their cash crops and more frequent visits from extension and health personnel and \npublic servants and officials. ", "    Appendix 5 31\n     \nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROJECT AREA \n \n1.  The technical assistance survey shows that less than 10% of the people in the project \narea run small businesses, mainly transportation, groceries, food and grain processing, trading \nof agricultural products, and eateries. Inadequate road infrastructure has greatly hampered \nsmall  businesses.  The  lack  of  skills,  insufficient  starter  funds,  limited  access  to  marketing \ninformation,  and  inexperience  hinder  local  commercial  activities.  The  survey  indicates  an \ninherent  entrepreneurial  spirit  among  residents  who,  if  they  could,  would  likely  set  up \ncommercial enterprises. During the technical assistance, a strategy was prepared to promote \nsmall businesses and commercial activities by (i) developing community-based enterprises such \nas  gasoline  stations,  agroprocessing,  herbal  and  homeopathic  medicines,  timber  products, \ndistribution and transport systems, hotels, and restaurants; (ii) building roadside stations as \nfocal points for small businesses; and (iii) creating an economic zone in each county specifically \ntargeting small businesses, which require government intervention to, for example, locate and \ngroup similar types of businesses. The county governments, with the provincial government, \nhave prepared a plan to set up small enterprises in the project area to facilitate community \ndevelopment in tandem with the upgrading or construction of the project roads. \n \n2.  A wide assortment of businesses will be established that provide local communities and \ntravellers with basic needs and create local jobs. The local governments are striving to attract \nmore private investment in local businesses. In collaboration with the provincial government, the \neight county governments in the project area have prepared a plan to spur small enterprises. \nUnder the 11th Five-Year Plan, CNY64 million will be pumped into 18 new factories; 56% of the \nfunds will come from the private sector. A township-owned paddy trading company will be \nestablished in Tieli county, and a village-owned refinery factory in Hailun county (Table A5.1). \nThe county governments will (i) allocate CNY8.0 million for a special-purpose loan that will help \nresidents set up small businesses, (ii) provide entrepreneurial training to poor residents, and (iii) \ncoordinate with cooperatives in providing small enterprises with assistance such as information \ndistribution. Each county also plans to construct one roadside station along the project highway, \ncosting a total of CNY34 million (para. 4). The roadside stations and new enterprises will \naccelerate community development in the project area.  \n \nTable A5.1 Small Business Development Plan by County \n \nCompletion   Investment  No of \nCounty  Type of Enterprise  Financing Source\nyear  (CNY million)  workers \n40%, by private \nOne gas station  2009  3.0  18 \n60%, by public  \nLinkou \nOne chalk factory  2008  1.0  100% by private  40 \nOne processing factory  2010  1.6  100% by private  20 \n25% by private \nTwo gas stations  2009  4.0  40 \n72% by public \nTonghe \nOne timber factory  2010  1.0  100% by private  20 \nOne  medicine processing factory  2010\u20132015  6.0  100% by public  120 \n45% by private \nFangzheng One processing factory  2009  4.0  70 \n55% by public \nOne timber factory  2009  2.1  100% by private  150 \nTieli \nOne medicine processing factory  2010\u20132015  4.2  100% by private  80 \nQing'an  One paddy trading station  2009\u20132010  2.6  100% by township 70 ", "32  Appendix 5 \nCompletion   Investment  No of \nCounty  Type of Enterprise  Financing Source\nyear  (CNY million)  workers \nOne food processing factory  2010  3.0  100% by private  30 \nOne rice processing factory  2010\u20132016  3.5  100% by private  15 \nOne timber factory  2010  2.6  100% by private  50 \nSuiling \nOne food processing factory  2010  3.6  100% by private  60 \nOne refinery  2010\u20132016  8.0  100% by village  20 \nHailun \nOne breed aquatics factory  2009  6.0  100% by private  10 \n42% by private \nOne bean processing factory  2009  2.4  50 \n58% by public \nBaiquan \n40% by private \nOne food factory  2010  5.0  118 \n60% by public \n      CNY = yuan. \n      Source: Heilongjiang Provincial Government, Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department, and county governments.  \n \n3.  Roadside Stations. The county government has drafted an extensive plan to construct \nroadside stations in the project area to spur development by linking the project roads with \ncommunity activities and to foster safe driving. Roadside stations normally provide parking \nareas; ancillary facilities such as bus terminals, gasoline stations, and local specialty markets; \nand agroprocessing facilities. In consultation with the local people, roadside stations are being \ndesigned to provide the strongest links possible between the communities and the road users \nby giving local business the chance to locate at the station. The county governments, with the \nprovincial government, have prepared a multi-phased action plan to construct roadside stations. \nEach county plans to construct one roadside station along the project highway, costing a total of \nCNY34 million for the eight counties. The roadside stations will house restaurants, hotels, \nagricultural  goods  shops,  local  specialty  shops,  and  markets.

", "Appendix 6  33\nROAD SAFETY AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS \n \n1.  Implementation of the Government's economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted \nin rapid economic growth and a persistent increase of the number of vehicles. The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) will continue to experience a high rate of motor vehicle growth for \nmany  years  to  come.  The  country  is  facing  increasingly  serious  road  safety  and  vehicle \nemissions problems, which inhibit economic and social development, and cause millions of \npremature deaths and injuries, increase medical costs, strain welfare services, and reduce \nproductivity.  Many  problems  encountered  with  road  safety  and  vehicle  emissions  are \npredominantly  institutional,  resulting  from  fragmentation  of  responsibility,  lack  of \ninterdepartmental coordination, inadequate data systems and monitoring, inadequate action \nplans and integrated strategies, inadequate enforcement and legislation, lack of road safety \naudits and accident black spot programs, weak vehicle inspection systems, and shortages of \nskilled staff and resources. \n \nA.  Road Safety \n2.  Accident rates in the PRC are higher than in highly motorized countries and in many \nother developing countries. Road accidents and their resultant economic losses represent a \nsubstantial problem and require urgent attention by the authorities. National statistics1 show that \nin 2004, road traffic accidents resulted in 107,077 deaths and 460,864 injuries, with costs \nequivalent to 1\u20133% of GDP. In Heilongjiang in 2004, there were 16,116 accidents that killed \n3,825 people and injured 18,377. To address the issue of road safety, the Ministry of Public \nSecurity prepared the 2004 Road Safety Action Plan, whose primary aims are to (i) reduce \nserious accidents (more than 10 fatalities), (ii) eliminate major accidents (30 or more fatalities), \nand (iii) facilitate implementation of the 2004 Road Safety Law. This is to be achieved through \nimproved vehicle safety, driver training, and improved traffic management. The traffic police, \nwho fall under the auspices of the Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau, are responsible for \npromoting road safety, enforcing traffic laws, and identifying preventive measures and accident \nblack  spots.  This  work  is  coordinated  with  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (HPCD) to consolidate interagency efforts.  \n \n3.  Safety is a major factor that must be considered, along with, for example, mobility and \neconomic and environmental impacts, to achieve balanced design standards for roads. The \ndesign of the highway was chosen to ensure that posted (legal) speed limits are attainable with \nan adequate margin of safety. Careful attention was given to the design of super-elevation on \ncurves, overtaking and curve sight distances, deceleration lanes at interchanges and service \nareas, and adequate road camber to ensure that surface water runs off the road surface during \nheavy rainfalls.  \n \n4.  Overloading of vehicles must be controlled as road safety is affected by the higher \ndemands placed on vehicles\u2019 braking systems, chassis strength, and flexibility; vehicles\u2019 stability \nwhen rounding curves; and steering difficulties resulting from heavy rear-end loads reducing \nfront-end weight, road contact, and friction with the road surface. HPCD will monitor operations \nin relation to overloaded vehicles and impose sufficient penalties on offenders to help reduce \nthe risk of traffic accidents, pavement damage, and maintenance costs. An efficient penalty \nsystem  will  be  in  place  to  discourage  operators  from  overloading.  Typical  penalties  could \ninclude (i) the suspension of operators\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses, (ii) the suspension of operators\u2019 goods \nlicenses, (iii) a large fine, and (iv) the requirement that operators unload their vehicles and \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Public Security. 2004 accidents statistics.  ", "34  Appendix 6 \nreload only to the allowable weight limit. HPCD uses the Road Safety Audit for Road Projects,2 \nwhich was developed under World Bank Highway Project in 2000. All road design and operation \nprocesses are subject to this road safety audit. Construction of the proposed highway to a high \nstandard will reduce accidents in the Jishou\u2013Chadong corridor. \n \n5.  An interdepartmental framework will be established under the Project to enhance road \nsafety.  While  HPCD  will  concentrate  on  engineering,  road  safety  audits,  black-spot \nimprovement, and operational issues pertaining to the highway, the Heilongjiang Public Security \nBureau will deal with traffic law enforcement issues to create safer roads.  \n \n6.  At least 6 months before the highway opens, HPCD will (i) implement a road safety \naction  plan  with  the  help  of  consulting  services;  and  (ii)  ensure,  in  collaboration  with \nHeilongjiang Public Security Bureau, that a team of bureau personnel will patrol the highway \nand enforce the new law and regulations. Some 20 person-months of consulting services from \ndomestic road safety specialist will be engaged to help HPCD develop the road safety action \nplan and check designs and safety aspects of the project roads. A rural road safety zone will be \ncreated to ensure rural road safety along the project roads. In the zone, the local government \nwill follow the best practices to ensure road safety along the rural roads. One rural link road \nsection in Qing\u2019an (2.5 km) was selected as a pilot rural safety zone. Some $60,000 will be \nearmarked to improve rural road safety. The accident rate and traffic volume will be monitored \nafter the operation of the highway to verify the result. \n \nB.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n7.  The increasing number of vehicles has raised concerns about vehicle emissions and air \npollution. The Government has taken several steps to control emissions: imposing regulations \non the automobile industry, requiring an annual vehicle test, and drafting a vehicle inspection \nand maintenance program. The new measures also set emission and fuel efficiency targets and \noffer tax incentives for manufacturers of more environmentally friendly cars. Heilongjiang has \nvehicle emission standards, and the Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau regularly \ntests all types of vehicles. The Project will have positive impacts on air pollution, as emissions \nfrom vehicles along the project roads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows as \na result of improved roads. Upon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from \nvehicles on the project roads are estimated to be 30% lower than before the Project. Carbon \ndioxideemissions will be30% lower. At least 6 months before the highway opens, HPCD will \n   \nprovide ADB with (i) the regulations for vehicle emission limits and the penalties for violating \nemission standards; and (ii) the latest government plan to improve air quality in Heilongjiang, \nincluding  cleaner  fuel  programs.  With  the  assistance  of  consulting  services,  HPCD  and \nHeilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau will develop an action plan to control vehicle \nemissions in the area and implement it accordingly. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

", "Appendix 8  37\nROAD MAINTENANCE \n \n1.  The Heilongjiang Provincial Highway Bureau is responsible for maintaining the national \nand  provincial  highways  in  Heilongjiang.  County  communication  bureaus  supply  labor  and \nequipment to the Heilongjiang Provincial Highway Bureau local offices. Cities, counties, and \nforestry bureaus are responsible for maintaining national, provincial, and other roads that pass \nthrough the counties.  \n \nA.  Maintenance Costs and Resources \n \n2.  The estimated routine maintenance costs per km every year for classes I, II, III, and IV \nare  CNY30,000,  CNY15,000,  CNY11,500,  and  CNY8,000.  For  each  class,  periodic \nmaintenance costs per km for every 9 years are CNY1.0 million, CNY0.5 million, CNY0.375 \nmillion,  and  CNY0.25  million.  Grants  for  maintenance  from  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial \nCommunications Department (HPCD) to local governments are CNY65,000 per km per year for \nclass-I roads, CNY31,000 per km per year for class II, CNY7,200 per km per year for the rest. \nEach county is given grants according to the length of each road class. A shortfall in funds is \ncommon, which could result in less-than-ideal roads. \n \nB.  Road Condition \n \n3.  Road conditions vary among counties because of the available materials: Linkou and \nTonghe have good gravel, while Baiquan and Hailun must haul it over 100 km. Gravel roads in \nLinkou, Fangzheng, and Tonghe are in good condition and well graded, while those in Qing\u2019an, \nSuiling, Hailun, and Baiquan have many potholes and are much rougher (Table A8.1). \n \nTable A8.1: Road Conditions  \n \nExisting  Pavement  Indicator of \nSection  County  Condition \nRoad  Type  roughness index \nLinkou Bypass  Linkou  S309  AC  5.87  Fair \nJintang to Daluomi  Linkou  S309  Gravel  6.07  Good \nJintang to Daluomi  Fangzheng  S309  Gravel  6.00  Good \nFangzheng to Tonghe  Fangzheng  S203  AC and PC  5.10  Fair \nTonghe to Tieli  Tonghe  S203  Gravel  6.68  Fair \nTonghe to Tieli  Tieli  S203  Gravel  7.92  Poor \nQing\u2019an to Suiling  Qing\u2019an  G171  Gravel  8.61  Poor \nQing\u2019an to Suiling  Suiling  G171  Gravel  7.12  Poor \nHailun to Baiquan  Hailun  G023  Gravel  7.59  Poor \nHailun to Baiquan  Baiquan  G023  Gravel  7.61  Poor \nAC, = asphalt concrete, PC = cement concrete. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants\u2019 estimates. \n \nC.  Issues and Problems \n \n4.  Adequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural  roads.  Local \nadministrative units are responsible for such maintenance, but the quality of rural roads does not \nseem to be systematically monitored by the higher authorities. Maintenance planning often \nhinges  on  a  subjective  assessment,  mainly  because  of  the  local  government\u2019s  inability  to \nmaintain its road networks because of lack of resources. While local authorities draft plans for \nroutine  maintenance  work,  periodic  maintenance  is  budget-driven  and  lacks  a  systematic, \npreventive approach.  \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \n5.  The maintenance system for class-II roads or above seems reasonable. However, there \nis no official funding channel to maintain township or village roads, which are mostly in class IV \nor below, or a system to enable provincial governments to fund rural road development. A \nreliable funding mechanism to maintain and rehabilitate rural roads must be designed. Since \nfunds for maintenance are limited, a simple method to evaluate and prioritize maintenance must \nalso be established to streamline work programming and make the most effective use of funds. \n \n6.  Apart  from  financial  constraints,  local  governments\u2019  maintenance  efforts  are  often \nhampered by a lack of qualified technical and managerial personnel, training resources, and \nequipment. Local governments must develop the capacity to contract out road maintenance. In \ntandem, start-up assistance must be extended to local road maintenance contractors in rural \nareas, ways to create jobs for the rural poor identified, and a suitable performance monitoring \nsystem put in place. \n \n7.  A major problem is pavement damage from overloaded trucks. As trucks have become \nbigger, the problem will continue. Although the Ministry of Communications does have axle load \nlimits, these are not enforced partly because suitable truck-weighing equipment is lacking. \nSuitable weighing machines must therefore be installed at each of the nine toll stations, and \nsystematic  checks  carried  out  for  overweight  vehicles.  Other  maintenance  equipment \nrecommended for procurement include snow removal vehicles, graders, loaders, pavement \npatch  mobile  mixers,  rollers,  tankers,  generators,  cherry  pickers,  mobile  axle  load \nmeasurement, and emergency tow trucks. \n \nD.  Recommendation \n \n8.  During project preparation, an action plan (Table A8.2) was established to strengthen \nlocal road maintenance. The action plan was agreed with HPCD. Following the plan, HPCD will \ndevelop  and  implement  a  sound  road  maintenance  management  system  during  project \nimplementation. The system will have (i) measures that minimize maintenance costs; (ii) a \nmodern method to prioritize evaluation and maintenance for efficient work programming and \nfund use; (iii) a compilation of road inventories, together with basic data on the condition of the \nroads; and (iv) a monitoring system to be used by local residents. HPCD will encourage county \ngovernments  to  adopt  competitive  bidding  among  maintenance  contractors  to  enhance \nefficiency.  The  Project  will  provide  a  training  program  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernment maintenance units. \n \nTable A8.2: Action Plan \n \nActivity   Requirements \nClassified Roads  Develop a functional classification for the road system \n  Determine the importance of each road in the overall road network \nEstablish a road condition system \nDevelop road maintenance work priorities \nAssign a cost for each activity and define overall cost \nBridges  Carry out the same process for the maintenance of bridges \nUnclassified Roads  Provide basic funding and technical advice to help maintenance of unclassified roads \n  Provide basic materials to the small communities  \nCapacity Building  Assign the Communications College to carry out capacity building and ongoing \ntraining to enhance local capacity \nFund  Optimize the maintenance fund, and ensure the sustainability of the road networks \n  Source: Technical assistance consultants\u2019 estimates.

The Project will lower transport costs and reduce travel time, and thus improve transport \nquality. Better road infrastructure and services will encourage villagers to go to markets, use \neducational and health facilities more frequently, and avail themselves of increased agricultural \nextension services. These benefits, which accrue directly to road users, are the Project\u2019s direct \neffects.  Improved  access  will  expand  economic  activities  and  gradually  lead  to  structural \nchanges in production and consumption patterns and in the labor market. Lower transport costs \nreduce the costs of traded farm inputs, thereby raising agricultural productivity and profitability. \nCropping patterns change with better roads, as farmers shift to high-value crops because of \neasier access to markets and new farming technologies. Better roads help increase nonfarm \njobs, raise wages, and reduce transaction costs, thereby spurring commercial activities. In turn, \nhigher incomes boost local people\u2019s demand for transport and the movement of goods and \nservices. These are the benefits that trickle down to local people over time. Even the rural poor \nwho rarely use roads also benefit from improved roads through cheaper goods and services and \nincreased economic opportunities. These are the Project\u2019s indirect effects.  \n \nA.  Monitoring Framework \n \n2.  Based on the findings of an Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance, a \nstandard monitoring framework and a set of monitoring indicators were designed to measure the \nactual benefits (Table A13.1).

The project highway, running from east to west in Heilongjiang with a total area of about \n9% of the province, traverses six counties\u2014Linkou, Fangzheng, Tonghe, Qing\u2019an, Suiling, and \nBaiquan\u2014and the cities of Tieli and Hailun. In 2004, the total population in the project area was \n3.4 million. Economic development in the project area lagged behind other counties.  \n \nB.   Network \n \n2.  Based  on  the  origin\u2013destination  and  traffic  counts  survey,  the  428  km  Jixi\u2013Nehe \nprovincial highway was divided into five sections for the traffic forecast. The associated rural link \nroads, totaling 170 km, were assigned to the corresponding highway sections to form five \nseparate networks (Table A14.1, and Map 2). The average trip distance between two points \nalong the highway was a major factor in the sectional division. The geographical location of the \nalignment  as  regards  altitude  and  existing  road  conditions  were  also  considered.  Normal, \ndiverted, and generated traffic were then forecast for each network. \n \nTable A14.1: Project Road by Section \n \n  Main highway  Rural link roads \nItem  From  To  Length (km)  No of sections  Total length (km) \nSection 1  Linkou  Dailumi  102.0  7  69.9 \nSection 2  Fangzheng  Tonghe  22.2  0  0.0 \nSection 3  Tonghe  Tieli  155.4  3  15.4 \nSection 4  Qingan  Suilinh  70.3  7  42.0 \nSection 5  Hailun  Baiquan  78.3  7  43.2 \nProject      428.2  22  170.4 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  Project highway in section 1 (102 km) starts at Xinhua and ends at the point where most \ntraffic from Xinhua will terminate. It includes the Linkou bypass and a new section from Jiantong \nto the border of Fangzheng, which crosses rolling-to-hilly terrain. The traffic on this section\u2014\nnow normal on the S309\u2014will be augmented by traffic that will be diverted from Jixi and Linkou \ntoward the provincial center, which now uses the expressway via Mudanjiang. Seven sections of \nrural link roads, totaling 69.9 km, are included in this section. \n \n4.  Project highway in section 2 (22.2 km) starts at Fangzheng county to Tonghe town. \nThese two points are separated by the Songhua river. Section 2 has an extra-large bridge (2.5 \nkm) crossing the Songhua. The traffic along section 2\u2014normal traffic plying Fangzheng and \nTonghe uses a ferry to cross the river\u2014will be augmented by generated traffic and diverted to \nTieli and Qing\u2019an. \n \n5.  Project highway in section 3 (155.4 km) starts at Tonghe and ends on the Yha Highway \nwest of Tieli, passing through Tonghe and Tieli county, crossing a denuded forest. The road is \nbad and often impassable. The terrain is hilly. The roads see little traffic now, but after the \nProject, the traffic passing through the provincial center will be diverted and be able to go \ndirectly from point to point. Three sections of rural link roads, totaling 15.4 km, are included. \n ", "46  Appendix 14 \n6.  Project highway in section 4 (70.3 km) starts on the Yha Highway east of Qing\u2019an and \nends on the Suibei Highway just east of Suiling. The road that connects the two towns is of \nrough gravel. The area is mainly agricultural and flat. Seven sections of rural link roads (totaling \n42 km) are included. Section 5 (78.3 km) starts on the Suibei Highway just west of Hailun city \nand ends on the Baiquan\u2013Nehe highway just west of Baiquan. Similarly, this road passes \nthrough mainly agricultural and flat lands. Seven sections of rural link roads (43.2 km) are \nincluded. \n \nC.  Traffic Analysis and Projections \n \n7.  The origin\u2013destination and traffic count surveys along the project roads were conducted \nin 2004 by the Design Institute. The average annual daily traffic on the project roads was \nestimated based on the 2004 traffic count surveys. \n \n8.  Traffic was projected based on the economic growth forecast for the project area and \nhistorical  growth  trends  in  traffic.  The  calculations  also  took  into  account  potential  traffic \ngeneration and diversion caused by (i) enhanced development opportunities resulting from the \nProject, (ii) traffic transferring to the project highway from existing roads in the project area, and \n(iii) traffic transferring away from the project highway because of toll charges.  \n \n9.  Three types of traffic are analyzed: normal, diverted, and generated. Normal traffic is \nwhat currently occurs on the project road. The size of normal traffic depends on the accessibility \nof an area and the condition of the road. There is no road at the Songhua river and a section \nbetween Tonghe and Teili. Ferries operate across the river throughout the year, except for 20 \ndays in winter. It takes 10 minutes to cross the river by ferry, but the waiting time at either end is \n30 minutes. Therefore, it takes 70 minutes to cross the river. \n \n10.  The origin\u2013destination survey shows that some traffic from other roads would divert to \nthe project roads.1 Diversion could occur (i) along the section between Linkou and Fangzheng, \nfrom Linkou or Jixi and Harbin; (ii) from Tieli and beyond, toward Linkou, where other detours \nare used;2 and (iii) along the Tieli\u2013Tonghe\u2013Fangzheng section,3 from Qing\u2019an and beyond to \nFangzheng and Linkou and Jixi areas. A total of 170 vehicles are expected to be diverted to the \nTieli\u2013Tonghe\u2013Fangzheng section. \n \n11.  The road improvement will spur transport demand. The project area covers 2.3 million \nha: paddy land (15%), dry land (42%), wood land (14%), and waste land (29%). Some 87% of \nthe wood land is in Tonghe and Tieli, while 13% is in Hailun and Baiquan. Although Tonghe is \none of the poorest counties, its timber industry would have tremendous potential with improved \ntransport. Baiquan is also one of the poorest counties; its crops, mainly rice and corn, have \nsimilarly big potential. Inadequate transport hampers the transport of coal in Baiquan to the \nnearest railway station. \n \n12.  Through and local traffic were analyzed using the origin\u2013destination survey. On average, \n62% of the traffic generated ended up within the eight counties/cities. The highest percentage \n(82%) was registered in Tonghe, and the lowest (37%) in Suiling. The traffic generated in \nTonghe remained within the county because of inadequate roads. Local traffic in Tonghe is 1.3 \ntimes that of the other counties and 1.9 times that of the major cities. Upgrading the project \n                                                 \n1  Since the railway does not run parallel to the project road, traffic from the railway is unlikely to divert to it. \n2  Based on the origin\u2013destination survey, 80% of the traffic from the Linkou\u2013Fangzheng section is assumed to \ntransfer to the new road, which will shorten the distance between Linkou and Fangzheng by 44 km. A total of 1,342 \nvehicles are expected to divert to the Linkou\u2013Fangzheng section. \n3  This section is not rendering the required transport services because of a broken portion between Tieli city and \nTonghe county and the disconnection across the Songhua river. ", "Appendix 14  47\nroads will substantially increase traffic in the project area, in general, and between the Songhua \nbridge and Tieli city, in particular. \n \n13.  The Project will make it easier for the residents in the western part of the project area to \nbring their agricultural surplus to markets in the eastern part, motivating them to increase \nproduction. Upgrading the Qing\u2019an\u2013Suiling and Hailun\u2013Baiquan sections will increase traffic. \nThe Project will connect the two broken ends of the Fangzheng\u2013Tonghe and Tonghe\u2013Tieli \nroads, making transport smoother and more efficient between the Xiaoxing\u2019anling forest zone \nand the economically developed southern areas, including Jilin province. The Tonghe\u2013Songhua \nbridge will be critical in boosting economic growth of the less developed areas. \n \n14.  The  Project  will  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  demand  for  transport  and \nreduce transport costs, travel times, and accidents.

", "48  Appendix 15 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The Project comprises the construction or upgrading of 5 sections of the Jixi\u2013Nehe \nprovincial highway, totaling 428 km, and the upgrading of 22 sections of rural link roads, totaling \n170 km. The economic evaluation was carried out using highway design and maintenance \n(HDM)-4. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project highway was estimated by \ncomparing the project case for 20 years after improvement, with a base case involving the \ncontinued use and maintenance of the existing road. Without the Project, congestion would \nincrease, resulting in delays, higher vehicle operating costs (VOC), and more accidents. The \nProject,  with  its  reduced  travel  distance  and  travel  time,  safer  design,  and  better  road \nconditions, will reduce VOCs and accident risks along the corridor. \n \n2.  Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2005 prices. The prices were expressed in \nyuan, employing the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for \nforeign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages \npaid to unskilled labor, but not on the wages paid to skilled labor, because no skilled worker \nsurplus exists. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to \nan economic opportunity cost of labor. The economic costs include (i) the capital cost, including \nphysical contingencies, land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation costs; \nand (ii) the costs of operating and maintaining the highway, including the costs of replacing \ndepreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  were  based  on  their \nopportunity costs; that is, the agricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced activities.1 \n \n3.  The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOC resulting from the reduced travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of the passengers\u2019 time and of \nfreight tied up in transit, and (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents. Lower VOC are the \nmain source of economic benefits for the Project. Traffic using the highway will enjoy higher \nspeeds on a smoother road with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and a \nshorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the alternative routes along the highway will also \nbenefit from the corresponding reduction in traffic volume and congestion, as vehicles switch to \nthe new project roads.  \n \n4.  Estimates  for  savings  in  VOC  and  travel  time  were  calculated  using  HDM-4.  The \neconomic  cost  of  accidents  was  estimated  using  the  information  available  at  insurance \ncompanies in Harbin, which calculate economic costs of an accident in terms of direct property \ndamage and forgone income. Fatality, injury, and property damage costs were assumed at \nCNY100,000, CNY7,500, and CNY7,000. The value-added of tourism was measured as the \nbenefits generated from tourism development by comparing situations with and without the \nProject. In Linkou, through which one of rural link roads passes, Melanhe river and Lake \nLianhua are potential tourist attractions. At present, about 10,000 tourists visit the sites per year; \nthe Project is expected to draw in more visitors, boosting tourist revenue 5% per year. It was \nassumed that 30% of the increased tourist revenue could be attributed to the Project. \n \n5.  The 428 km Jixi\u2013Nehe provincial highway was divided into five sections for the economic \nanalysis. The associated rural link roads, totaling 170 km, were assigned to the corresponding \nhighway sections to form five separate networks. An EIRR was calculated for each network. The \nEIRR for the five road sections swings from 15% to 26%, with a consolidated EIRR of 21.2%. At \na 10% rate of discount, the net present value (NPV) calculated for each project section ranges \n                                                 \n1  The economic opportunity costs of land were assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, \nwhich was calculated for land compensation. No additional opportunity cost for land was assumed, because all the \nland is in the rural areas. \n ", "Appendix 15  49\nfrom  CNY362  million  to  CNY1.4  billion.

The local \ninflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic cost escalation \nfactor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign exchange was \nassumed to be 1.9%. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking into account the \npotential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n2.  Operating revenues from tolls were projected based on forecast traffic and a base toll \nrate of CNY0.35 per passenger car per km. Given the specific length of the road between toll \nplazas, a schedule of toll rates per plaza was devised with corresponding tolls for all vehicle \ntypes\u2014for  a  light  truck,  small  bus  or  medium-sized  truck,  large  bus  or  truck;  and  for  an \narticulated truck or a trailer.2 The toll charges are assumed to increase in current terms once \nevery 5 years to keep up with inflation. Given the complexity of the civil works, the capital cost of \nthe Project is much higher than for other highway projects. \n \n3.  Annual incremental operation and maintenance costs were calculated based on 2005 \nprices: (i) toll operation costs were estimated at 150 staff members with annual salary costs of \nCNY25,000 per employee; (ii) administration costs were assumed to be CNY3.79 million per \nyear, with an annual increase of 3%; and (iii) maintenance costs were estimated at CNY12,000 \nper  km  per  year  for  routine  work  and  CNY0.5  million  per  km  for  periodic  work.  Periodic \nmaintenance was scheduled for 2018 and 2024. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are \ncharged on revenue. Corporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting business \ntaxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried \nforward. An estimated 5% of passenger cars forecast to be localized traffic were considered to \nbe exempt from paying tolls. \n \n4.  An ADB loan, a loan from China Development Bank, and grants from the Ministry of \nCommunications and the Heilongjiang provincial government are expected to cover project \nfinancing. The ADB loan amounts to $200 million, with standard ordinary capital resources \nterms of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. The grants from the ministry and the \ngovernment amount to 38% of project costs, which will be viewed as project equity.

The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that the revenues are adequate to cover operation and maintenance costs, \nbut net income is negative in the first 5 years of operation because of high depreciation costs \nand high interest payments. The cash flow projections show a positive cash flow throughout the \nproject  period.

A financial evaluation has been undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects \nFinanced by ADB.1 A financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated based on the \nProject\u2019s capital cost, the most recent traffic forecasts, and the proposed toll rates. Sensitivity \ntests  were  conducted  by  varying  the  project  costs,  traffic  volumes,  and  toll  rates  and \ncombinations  of  these  factors.  The  financial  evaluation  was  computed  over  4  years  of \nconstruction and 20 years of operations. The calculations are in constant 2005 prices.  \n \n2.  The local inflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic \ncost escalation factor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign \nexchange was assumed to be 1.9%. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking \ninto account the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n3.  Heilongjiang province is applying unified toll rates to all class-II highways according to \nthe provincial government\u2019s policy, which is about 30% lower than for expressways. The toll \nrates were developed based on the government\u2019s toll road policies, affordability for road users, \nand neighboring provinces\u2019 toll rates. To calculate the FIRR, existing toll rates in Heilongjiang \nhave been used for the first 5 years of operation and increased once every 5 years thereafter. \nThe project capital cost is much higher than for other highway projects in the province because \nof the construction of the Songhuajang bridge and difficult geographic and geological conditions. \nApplicable business taxes of 5.5% are charged on revenues. Corporate income tax of 33% is \npaid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,  depreciation  and  interest  charges,  and \noperating expenses.    \n \n4.  The major assumptions used to calculate the FIRR are the following: (i) all calculations \nare made in 2005 prices, covering 2006 to 2029; (ii) capital costs include all incremental capital \nexpenditures related to the construction and equipment for the highway, but exclude price \ncontingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating and maintaining costs include all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the highway, but exclude depreciation and \ndebt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in financial projections were \nalso adjusted to 2005 prices; and (v) the residual value of the project capital cost was estimated \nto be 40% for the bridge and 15% for roads after 20 years of operation. \n \n5.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms, was calculated at \n2.78%, using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: \n(i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.60% was used \nfor ADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.12% per annum is used for the domestic loan \nfunds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8.00%. The cost of debt was also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income of 33%. \n \n6.  The FIRR, computed after tax, is calculated at 6.53% (Table A17.1), higher than the \nWACC of 2.78%. The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests \nindicate conditions causing the Project\u2019s viability to fall below WACC are unlikely to occur. The \nresults of the sensitivity tests are in Table A17.2. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

It involves upgrading 428 km of \nthe Jixi-Nehe provincial highway (particularly between Linkou and Baiquan) in Heilongjiang province; constructing 170 \nkm of rural link roads, which serve isolated poor counties and townships; providing consultancy services and training; \nundertaking project monitoring and evaluation; and improving road safety. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                            Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAccording to Heilongjiang\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan on Poverty, 600 villages will implement the poverty reduction program in \n2006\u20132007, 700 villages in 2008\u20132009, and the final 780 villages in 2010\u20132011. \nTwo counties are poor\u2014Baiquan and Tonghe. The Heilongjiang Social Science Academy survey shows that there are \n26 poor villages in 36 townships in the project area, 65% are located in Baiquan and Tonghe. \nThe poverty analysis has demonstrated the Project will have significant impacts on rural people, including improved \naccess to education, health, and information. An estimated 379,509 poor people in the project area will directly benefit \nfrom the Project. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes     No  \nThe stakeholder analysis is reflected in the social and poverty analysis report, and its recommendations are in the social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP). The analysis revealed that most stakeholders across a wide spectrum of government \nagencies (health, poverty, education, religion, tourism, women) supported the project at both the county and village \nlevels. Mayors often participated in the field work along with key village leaders. The analysis suggested a number of \nissues that have been integrated into the SDAP to mitigate negative or adverse impacts and to diversify farmers\u2019 income \nthrough new small-business opportunities and job creation. \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes     No \nThe SDAP follows a consultative approach during implementation. Village leaders and stakeholders are involved in \nmonitoring the Project\u2019s progress. \nThe project strategy is to maximize employment benefits from road construction; increased job opportunities are \nexpected to benefit the poor. Women will support and actively participate in the road safety component, especially where \nyoung school children cross the roads. This has been proposed in the SDAP. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe Project will have no adverse impacts on women.  Women are expected to gain from new opportunities such as new \nagricultural products, and improved roads will help women receive faster emergency health care. \nFifty percent of the stakeholders consulted during the social survey were women.  Targeting female road users, gender \nfocus groups were held in targeted villages, including those with ethnic minorities.  Women were found to be heavily \ninvolved in the transport sector through either in truck or as bus operators and were keen to support the Project and \nlooked forward to the benefits from an improved road system.

The Project will upgrade a provincial highway, totaling 428 km, and 170.4 km of rural \nlinking roads. The Project will affect 8 counties, 36 townships, 130 administrative villages, 6 \nforest bureaus, and 24 forest stations. About 1,391 ha will be permanently acquired, of which \n38% of the total is cultivated and 44% forest. Land acquisition will directly affect the equivalent of \n5,663 households. Another 428 ha will be temporarily used during construction. A total of 25,034 \nm2 of structures will be demolished. In total, house demolition will affect 201 households and 11 \nenterprises. To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has closely consulted local officials and affected people and village committees during the \npreliminary  design  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plan.  Ethnic  minorities  belonging  to \nvulnerable groups will get special assistance in economic rehabilitation and priority for career \ntraining. All affected minorities will be relocated in the original villages. \n \nA.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n2.  The objective of the resettlement program is to ensure that the affected people will \nimprove their standards of living, or at least not be made worse off by the Project, consistent with \nthe  laws  and  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  ADB\u2019s  involuntary \nresettlement policy.1 The resettlement plan is based on the provisions of the Land Administration \nLaw of 1998 and the new regulations stemming from the State Council Decision to Deepen \nReform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration. Heilongjiang Land Administration Regulation \nand Forest Law also apply to resettlement under the Project. \n \n3.  Based  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and  those  affected,  a  set  of \ncompensation  standards,  based  on  the  replacement  cost,  was  formulated  by  Heilongjiang \nProvincial Communications Department (HPCD) and approved by the Ministry of Land and \nResources.  The  resettlement  principles  set  for  the  Project  follow:  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized by developing and comparing a series \nof design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements are based on market value; (iii) land \ntemporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) the per capita \nlandholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard; (v) \nwhere  land  allocation  per  capita  is  not  sufficient  to  maintain  the  standard,  other \nincome-generating  activities  will  be  provided;  (vi)  a  preferential  policy  will  be  provided  to \nvulnerable  groups,  including  compensation,  housing  assignment,  transfer  assistance,  and \nemployment; (vii) all those affected will be adequately informed about details of compensation; \nand (viii) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any \nproblems.  \n \n4.  The compensation for permanent arable land acquisition is set at 10 times the annual \naverage output value (AAOV) in the past 3 years, and this is combined with a resettlement \nsubsidy calculated at six times the AAOV for all types of cultivated land. The compensation for \nforest land includes four parts: reforestation fee, resettlement subsidy, land compensation, and \nforest compensation. All the compensation for forest land has been paid to the State Forestry \nAdministration, and affected forest bureaus and HPCD have obtained the forest land using \napproval documents. Any income lost from temporary occupation of land will also be paid in cash \nto the owner or user at a rate of two times the AAOV. As soon as the construction is completed, \nthe land will be returned to the users and restored to its original form. Housing compensation will \nbe based on the housing area, construction materials, and market prices for replacement value. \n                                                        \n1  ADB. 1995. ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 20  59\nThere will be no deduction for depreciation, and owners will be allowed to salvage materials from \ntheir old houses. Relocation will provide an opportunity to improve current housing conditions. \nThe households will also receive a transfer and transportation allowance. These households will \nbe relocated to another site within their original village. All infrastructures, facilities, and other \nassets will be compensated at replacement rates, without any deduction for depreciation, to \nallow full reconstruction by the owners. For land acquisition, the land compensation will be paid \nto the affected village committee and the resettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected \nhouseholds. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will also be paid \ndirectly to affected farmers. For enterprises, compensation will be paid to owners. The payment \nwill be made in cash according to the appraised value of the property. Income losses resulting \nfrom reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \nB.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation  \n \n5.  The resettlement strategy encompasses the restoration of livelihoods and income. Since \nthe impacts are widely dispersed among affected villages and per capita of land holding is higher \nthan in other parts of the country, the actual losses will not be significant and land loss impacts \ncould be mitigated and replaced. Therefore, all affected people will remain in agriculture. They \nwill either be provided with replacement land from the village reserve land or cash compensation. \nAgricultural  measures  will  include  developing  new  farmland,  improving  irrigation  works, \nupgrading low-yielding farmland, and provision of training in agricultural technology. Income \ngeneration activities such as forestry, horticulture, livestock, and sideline businesses will also be \ndeveloped to restore incomes and livelihoods for the relocated people. Affected people will be \ngiven special preference for jobs during construction and operation. HPCD and relevant county \noffices will proactively coordinate with local labor bureaus, employment centers, and enterprises \nto identify job and businesses opportunities for affected people who seek off-farm employment. \nHPCD will help the resettlers gain information and contacts regarding such opportunities. This \nassistance will be especially important for agricultural households seeking to diversify their \neconomy through nonagricultural means. All the workers will still work in the same factory after \nthe relocation. \n \n6.  Some 659 poor households have been identified as affected by the Project. To ensure \ntheir maximum protection during the land acquisition and resettlement process, the following \nprovisions are made: (i) they will be given priority for jobs with the Project; (ii) if they are to be \nrelocated, assistance will be provided by the village committee and local government for house \nconstruction;  (iii)  incorporation  of  their  needs  and  interests  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  will  be  ensured  through  consultation  and  participation  programs.  During \nresettlement, the project implementation unit (PIU) will pay particular attention to the difficulties \nand  needs  of  women  and  women-headed  households  and  will  formulate  and  implement \nprograms through regular consultations with women. The programs will include the following: (i) \nwomen will be given high priority for project jobs; and (ii) special financial incentives will be \nprovided  for  new  small  enterprises  developed  by  women  from  the  affected  households, \naccording to the preferential policies of local governments. The Project will have no significant \nadverse impacts on ethnic minorities. There will be partial loss of farmland for 329 minority \nhouseholds,  mostly  Chaoxian.  Besides  the  standard  compensation  entitlements,  special \nassistance in economic rehabilitation and career training will be provided to ensure adequate \nrestoration. If any ethnic minority households are displaced, they will be relocated in their original \nvillages. The Chaoxian villages are supportive of the Project because it will increase business \ninvestment. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 20 \nC.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management \n \n7.  The cost for land acquisition and resettlement is CNY313 million, including contingencies, \ntaxes, and fees for resettlement administration. According to the compensation policies and \nstandards defined in the resettlement plan, the payment and usage of compensation funds will \nbe carried out under the supervision of the internal monitoring agencies, with regular reviews by \nthe external monitoring agency. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village, \nenterprise,  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with  village \ncommittees, households and enterprises. \n \nD.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n \n8.  The affected people have been notified and consulted on the key elements of the \nresettlement plan. On various occasions during interviews, focus group discussions, public \nconsultation workshops, and community consultation, local representatives have participated in \nthe  planning  and  their  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plan.  The \nresettlement information booklet was disseminated to affected households and village offices in \nFebruary 2006. The information booklet contains the resettlement scope, project schedule, \ncompensation rates for land and other assets, relocation and economic rehabilitation strategies, \nand grievance redress mechanisms. When grievances arise, the affected people may submit an \noral or written complaint first to the village committee. If the village cannot solve the issue, it can \nbe taken to the township government. If the grievance is still unresolved, they can seek redress \nat the county land administration bureau. The appeal must be replied within 2 weeks. If any \naffected person is not satisfied or if the complaint is serious, the PIU will try to solve the problem. \nIf the grievance is still not resolved satisfactorily, as a last resort, final redress may be sought in \nthe civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedure Act. \n \nE.  Institutional Responsibilities, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Schedule \n \n9.  The  PIU\u2019s  project  resettlement  office  will  coordinate  the  planning,  implementation, \ninternal monitoring and supervision, financing, and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. \nCounty land administration bureaus will be responsible for implementing the resettlement plan. \nThey will work closely with township and village resettlement offices or forest stations, which will \nbe responsible for delivering entitlements, selecting new housing sites, monitoring development \nof  replacement  land,  and  implementing  economic  rehabilitation  measures  among  affected \nvillages. HPCD and local land bureaus will take full responsibility for the internal monitoring to \nensure that the project complies with requirements described in the resettlement plan. An \nindependent monitoring agency will be engaged by HPCD to undertake resettlement monitoring \nand evaluation for the Project. External monitoring will be undertaken biannually and reported to \nADB and HPCD. Once resettlement activities are completed, annual tracer surveys will be \nconducted to evaluate livelihoods and incomes compared with the baseline survey results. The \nreports will provide information regarding whether resettlement objectives have been achieved \nand the relocated families have achieved equal or better livelihoods and living standards. HPCD \nwill engage the external monitor by June 2006. Resettlement implementation is scheduled to \nprecede the project construction schedules. Land acquisition activities are planned to commence \nin August 2006. Relocation of displaced houses will be completed before road construction.  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060731142931+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060703113615+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan\r\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China: Heilongjiang Road\r\nNetwork Development Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 26 June 2006) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00 =  $0.1250 \n$1.00 =  CNY8.0002 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  EIA  \u2013  environmental impact assessment \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  FIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return \n  FYP  \u2013  five-year plan \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  HEPB  \u2013  Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau \n  HPCD  \u2013  Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department  \n  HPG  \u2013  Heilongjiang provincial government \n  LIBOR  \u2013  London interbank offered rate \n  MOC  \u2013  Ministry of Communications \n  NTNDP  \u2013  northeast regional transport network development plan \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PAM  \u2013  project administration memorandum \n  PCR  \u2013  project completion report  \n  PPMS  \u2013  project performance management system \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  VOC  \u2013  vehicle operating cost \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n(iii)  The exchange rate of the yuan is determined under a floating exchange rate \nsystem.
