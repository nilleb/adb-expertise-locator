INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the design and \nimplementation of country- and/or city-wide inclusive sanitation (CWIS) solutions in developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will provide targeted \nsupport to facilitate investments in CWIS with the aim of increasing access to adequate and \ninclusive sanitation systems\u2014whether sewered or non-sewered, centralized or decentralized\u2014\nwhere human waste is safely managed along the whole sanitation service chain. The TA is in line \nwith Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.2 of achieving access to adequate and equitable \nsanitation solutions with special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable \nsituations.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the ADB Management-approved 2019 results-based work plan of \nADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department and will provide support to \nADB\u2019s water subsector operations to help achieve the goals of Strategy 2030, and in particular \nthe following operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality, (iii) making cities more livable, and (iv) promoting rural \ndevelopment and food security, (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Inadequate access to sanitation. In 2017, 1.2 billion people across Asia and the Pacific \nlacked access to basic sanitation services and 453 million people practiced open defecation,3 \nwhich poses a huge challenge towards achieving SDG 6 (footnote 1). Out of these 1.2 billion \npeople, almost 72% lived in rural areas while the rest lived in urban areas. Similarly, open \ndefecation is still practiced by more people in rural areas (423 million) than in urban areas (30 \nmillion). Aside from increased exposure to waterborne diseases, open defecation is particularly \nharmful for women, who are often exposing themselves to risks of violence, harassment, and \nphysical abuse.4 On-site sanitation solutions such as latrines and septic tanks are predominant in \nAsia, where only a small fraction of the population is connected to sewerage systems comprising \na network of sewer pipes directly connecting toilets to sewage (or wastewater) treatment plants. \nOnly 18% of the population across Asia and the Pacific is connected to sewerage systems while \n40% uses on-site sanitation.5 \n \n4.  Traditional approaches favor certain systems and locations. A large part of ADB \nsanitation investments has been focused on centralized sewerage systems, often in urbanized \nareas.6 Urbanization has outpaced planning, which is necessary for extensive underground piped \nnetworks. Piped sewer networks connected to a centralized wastewater treatment facility require \nlarge capital investments and a strong institutional framework for the operation and maintenance \nof the assets. In low-density peri-urban and rural areas, pipe networks are not as financially \n____________________ \n \n1  United Nations. 2015.

The Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund (SFPTF)7 focused on supporting non-\nsewered sanitation solutions or fecal sludge management for both urban and peri-urban areas.8 \nUnder the SFPTF, a five-pillar approach was adopted that comprised grant investments, piloting \ninnovative technologies, building capacity of water and wastewater operators, developing policies \nand standards, and improving institutional awareness. This multipronged approach has leveraged \na total of $133.7 million of investments in non-sewered sanitation solutions included in six \ninvestment projects in five DMCs.9 With the growing acceptance of fecal sludge management as \na viable solution, ADB will leverage its track record in implementing sewerage projects to develop \nmore integrated and inclusive sanitation projects. The TA builds on the various outputs and \nlessons from SFPTF-supported projects, which combined the support of investment projects with \ncapacity  building  initiatives  hard  and  soft  investments  through  the  five-pillar  approach  for \nmaximum impact. \n \n6.  Country- and/or city-wide inclusive sanitation concept. To achieve the SDG 6.2 \ntargets, it is necessary to adopt new approaches and to apply alternative sanitation concepts. The \nCWIS concept aims to provide equitable and inclusive sanitation services that address the \nrealities found in developing countries. CWIS implies the following principles: (i) everyone, \nincluding people living in unserved, low-income, and vulnerable communities, benefits from \nequitable and safe sanitation service delivery outcomes; (ii) gender and social equity are included \nin planning, management, and monitoring; (iii) human wastes are safely managed along the whole \nsanitation service chain (capture, containment, emptying, transport, treatment, and safe reuse or \ndisposal); (iv) authorities operate with a clear, inclusive mandate, performance targets, resources, \nand accountability; (v) a diversity of technical solutions is embraced for adaptive, mixed, and \nincremental  approaches  that  include  sewered  and  non-sewered  sanitation  solutions;  (vi) \ncomprehensive long-term planning fosters demand for innovation and is informed by analysis of \nneeds and resources; (vii) political will and accountability systems provide incentives for service \nimprovements in planning, capacity, and leadership; and (viii) resource recovery and reuse of \nwater, energy, and nutrients are considered (circular economy approach). The TA will help ADB \nto increase its efforts to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing of the CWIS concept \namong stakeholders. \n \n7.  There is a need to accelerate CWIS in DMCs through (i) developing holistic, integrated \nplanning  and  design  approaches  that  consider  both  sewered  and  non-sewered  sanitation \nsolutions; (ii) assessing and developing institutional arrangements to delineate responsibilities \nand ensure ownership and leadership of the government, and develop regulations, policies, and \nstandards that address current and emerging trends, and their enforcement; (iii) determining \noptimal technical designs utilizing appropriate innovative technologies, resource recovery, and \ninformation technology applications; (iv) promoting knowledge sharing with development partners \n____________________ \n \n7  The SFPTF under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) was established on 5 August 2013 between ADB \nand the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through a $15 million financing agreement. \n8  Non-sewered sanitation solutions refers to systems and practices of managing human excreta that do not employ \npipes or a network, and can comprise on-site facilities such as pits or septic tanks for capturing the waste, vacuum \ntrucks for emptying pits, and tanks for conveyance to a treatment plant or other safe disposal. \n9  DMCs with non-sewered sanitation investments, which the SFPTF has leveraged on, are Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nIndia, Mongolia, and Nepal. Other DMCs currently supported by the SFPTF with capacity building and institutional \ndevelopment programs are Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Sri \nLanka. \n \n ", "3 \nor leading knowledge platforms; (v) promoting private sector participation in service delivery; (vi) \nincreasing awareness about the negative impacts of insufficient sanitation services through \nstrategic communication campaigns; and (vii) building awareness at all levels to strengthen the \nprofile of proper sanitation services.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to adequate and equitable sanitation \nand hygiene achieved for all, and open defecation eliminated by 2030, with special attention to \nthe needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations (SDG 6.2) (footnote 1). The TA \nwill have the following outcome: adoption of CWIS principles in ADB operations increased.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Support  for  country-  and/or  city-wide  inclusive  sanitation  projects \nprovided. This will be done in ADB operations by supporting (i) additional specialists who can \nprovide  incremental  inputs  by  introducing  or  applying  CWIS  principles  in  planning  and \nimplementation of projects, and (ii) resilience and circular economy initiatives for sustainability of \ninvestments. \n(i)  Pipeline  projects  on  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  or  flood \nmanagement will be reviewed and supported to ensure that CWIS principles are \nconsidered.12 The TA will support ADB\u2019s operations departments with necessary \nexpertise to incorporate the principles of CWIS in project planning, design, and \nimplementation.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  support  operations  departments  in \ndeveloping equitable and inclusive sanitation solutions in urban and nonurban \nareas that take into account different, appropriate technologies and systems to \nensure that human waste is safely managed along the whole sanitation service \nchain. As appropriate and as the demand arises, the TA may also support pilot \ntesting of appropriate, innovative, and/or high-level sanitation technologies13 and \nservice  delivery  methods,  which  may  include  public\u2013private  partnerships  or \nsystems and approaches that best demonstrate CWIS principles. \n(ii)  The TA will promote sustainability and resilience by identifying project risks and \nvulnerabilities and developing resilience strategies and responses to disasters. \nWhen appropriate, circular economy principles which reuse water, energy, and \nnutrients will be incorporated in project designs to increase focus on minimizing \nwaste and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n____________________ \n \n10 Aside from those already in the SFPTF portfolio (footnote 9), additional target DMCs under this TA are Fiji, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Solomon Islands, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam. These have \nbeen arrived at by looking at the current pipeline, work program, and budget framework and discussions with project \nofficers to identify possible opportunities for incorporating CWIS. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 In DMCs supported by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF), tools such as resilience \nworkshops, community-led projects, and application of geospatial tools such as the Spatial Data Analysis Explorer, \nwhich can help identify project risks and vulnerabilities, will be included. Water Operators Partnerships, whenever \npossible, will be provided for UCCRTF countries. DMCs supported by the UCCRTF are Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, \nNepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet Nam \n13 This refers to recently developed new technologies such as reinvented toilets, which are designed to kill pathogens \nand transform human waste into valuable resources at a low cost to users and without connections to water supply \nor sewer systems. Examples can be found in the Reinvented Toilet Expo brochure at https://stepsforsanitation.org/ \nwp-content/uploads/2018/11/The-Reinvented-Toilet-Exhibitor-Guide-FINAL.pdf. \n ", "4 \n \n10.  Output 2: Knowledge on country- and/or city-wide inclusive sanitation principles \nimproved. The TA will provide support to operations departments to develop CWIS policy \ndocuments and implementation guidelines, monitoring frameworks, indicators, and case studies. \nFor ADB DMCs, the TA will provide guidance to strengthen policies, regulations, and best \npractices  to  promote  CWIS  principles,  and  capacity  building  for  enforcing  regulations  and \nstrengthening  government  leadership.  This  will  include  mainstreaming  CWIS  principles  in \nsanitation master plans and incorporating CWIS principles in local sanitation codes or ordinances, \nwhich will require development of guidelines on monitoring and tracking; promotion of progressive \nfinancial strategies; and development of business models, operation and maintenance manuals, \nand protocols. Working with other partners, the TA will develop guidelines, regulations, policies, \nand toolkits such as a CWIS draft monitoring framework that can design and monitor CWIS \nindicators at portfolio and project level. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Country-  and/or  city-wide  inclusive  sanitation  related  capacity  and \nawareness  in  developing  member  countries  improved.  The  TA  will  contribute  to \nmainstreaming  sanitation  and  the  CWIS  concept  in  ADB\u2019s  operations,  and  to  promoting \ncontinuous learning and networking on CWIS. ADB will utilize its best practices, such as the Water \nOperators Partnerships Program, to complement planned and ongoing CWIS initiatives and to \nimprove operational knowledge to deliver sanitation services, including regulatory practices. This \nwill be done by pairing a developing water operator recipient with a water utility mentor with \nadvanced experience and proven success in effective, efficient service delivery who can impart \noperational knowledge to the recipient through on-the-job training. Knowledge-sharing events, \nsuch as ADB\u2019s Asian Sanitation Dialogue, will be conducted to raise awareness of and advocate \nfor CWIS. Together with ADB\u2019s operations departments, in-country dialogues and peer-to-peer \nlearning will be conducted to promote the CWIS concept in ADB\u2019s DMCs. Knowledge sharing, \nincluding dissemination of CWIS publications and studies, will be integral to promoting the \nconcept in ADB operations and DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $5 million, of which (i) $3 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the SFPTF14 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF), and (ii) $2 million \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF)15 \nunder the Urban Financing Partnership Facility, both administered by ADB. Key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. Expenses listed in Appendix 2 are eligible under the respective guidelines \nof the SFPTF and the UCCRTF. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. In close coordination with \nthe operations departments, resident missions, and other sector and thematic groups, the Water \nSector Group under the Sector Advisory Services Cluster of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and \nClimate  Change  Department  will  implement  the  TA  and  will  carry  out  TA  administration, \nimplementation supervision, and communication with consultants and other entities engaged \nthrough the TA. \n \n____________________ \n \n14 Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n15 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n ", "5 \n14.

Once the application is approved, project officers will be responsible for recruiting experts, \nmanaging contracts and output, ensuring timely disbursement, and providing ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department with progress updates.  \n \n16.  Cofinancier requirements. The WFPF semiannual and annual reports are provided to \ncomply with the monitoring and reporting requirements of the SFPTF. In addition, a detailed \nprogress report on the SFPTF-supported projects are provided as a supplement to the WFPF \nreports. For a TA project, the UCCRTF requires gender-disaggregated data reports on activities \nrelated to consultations and capacity building. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $3,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund \nunder the Water Financing Partnership Facility; and (ii) ADB administering technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Urban Climate \nChange Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility for Accelerating \nSanitation for All in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n____________________ \n \n16 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with  \nAccess to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene achieved for all, and open defecation eliminated by \n2030, with special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations (Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 6.2)a \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome       \nAdoption of CWIS  By 2023:     \nprinciples in ADB  a.
