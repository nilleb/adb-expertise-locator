During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government of India confirmed its \nrequest for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Urban \nManagement Support Program in Kerala. Following further discussions, the Government and \nADB agreed that a TA would be provided in 2004.1 The Fact-Finding Mission was conducted in \nTrivandrum, India, 17\u201325 October 2004 to prepare the TA. The Mission held discussions with \nthe Local Self-Government (Urban) Department (LSGUD) to reach understanding on the TA\u2019s \nobjectives and scope. Costs and implementation arrangements were agreed on separately after \nthe Fact-Finding Mission. The TA Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Kerala is a relatively small state with 32 million inhabitants, but has the third highest \npopulation density in India (819 people per square kilometer), after West Bengal and Bihar. \nKerala has 5 municipal corporations, 53 municipalities, and 991 bloc or village  panchayats, \nwhich are all  classified as local self-governments (LSGs). With the passage of the Kerala \nMunicipalities  Act  (1994),  the  Kerala  Panchayat  Raj  Act  (1994),  and  the  73rd  and  74th \nConstitution Amendment Acts, Kerala has implemented large-scale decentralization of both \nfiscal and administrative powers to the LSGs, making them responsible for the provision, \noperation, and maintenance of civic services. As part of the decentralization process, the \ngovernment of Kerala (GoK) set up the State Performance Audit Authority, which was tasked \nwith conducting performance audits of  LSGs. However, the LSGs\u2019 financial and managerial \nperformance have not made them attractive for bank borrowing or capital market issues. ADB is \npreparing  the  Kerala  Sustainable  Urban  Development  Project,2  designed  to  help  selected \nmunicipalities (i) promote good urban governance in municipal management and (ii) develop \nand expand urban infrastructure to increase the municipalities\u2019 economic opportunities and \nreduce their vulnerability to environmental degradation and urban poverty. The sustainability of \nthe  Project\u2019s  investments  can  be  ensured  by  improving  the  managerial  and  financial \nperformance of the participating municipalities. \n \n3.  GoK  has  recognized  the  importance  of  promoting  good  urban  governance.  On  5 \nSeptember  2003  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Poverty \nAlleviation and GoK signed a memorandum of agreement to confirm GoK\u2019s commitment to \nundertaking reforms in housing, urban infrastructure, and the municipal sector. The intent is to \n(i) improve urban governance and (ii) achieve viability and self-sustainability in the provision of \nvarious urban services. The reform measures to which GoK committed itself include introducing \na double-entry (accrual) system of accounting in urban local bodies, namely, the 5 municipal \ncorporations (Calicut, Cochin, Trissur, Trivandrum, and Quilon) and the 53 municipalities. The \nurban local bodies currently maintain their accounting records under a cash-based accounting \nsystem rather than a double-entry system of accounting, that is, revenues are recognized only \nwhen cash has been received, while expenditures are recorded only upon payment. \n \n4.  Improved account record keeping and maintenance, complemented by higher capacity \nof personnel, will help enhance the governance and transparency of the urban local bodies. \nUrban local bodies need assistance to convert to the double-entry accounting system not only to \nmeet GoK\u2019s requirements, but also to improve financial governance in their respective units. \nProper accounting of assets and liabilities will enable lenders to urban local bodies to accurately \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 July 2004. \n2 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "2  \ndetermine the financial position and capacity of municipal corporations and municipalities before \nundertaking new investments and will ensure accurate reporting, will protect the urban local \nbodies\u2019 assets, and will provide baseline information to facilitate efficient allocation of financial \nresources. \n \n5.  India\u2019s comptroller and auditor general (CAG) has set up a task force to establish the \naccounting and budgeting formats to be used by Indian states. The task force has also prepared \na timetable for the implementation of these formats. The Government of India will be supplying \nguidelines that apply to Kerala. \n \n6.  GoK set up  a state-level monitoring committee in March 2003. In September 2003, \nGoK\u2019s Cabinet decided to implement double-entry accounting at the level of urban local bodies, \nwhich are required to implement the system by April 2006. To support these efforts, GoK \ncreated a steering committee in January 2004 whose members include the secretary of GoK\u2019s \nFinance Department, the secretary of LSGUD, the state\u2019s general auditor, the accountant \ngeneral for accounts and entitlements, the examiner/director of Local Fund Audit, the chief \nexecutive officer of one of the municipal corporations, the state performance auditor, and the \ndirector of Information Kerala Mission (IKM).  \n \n7.  IKM is an agency that reports to Kerala\u2019s LSGUD. Its objectives are to (i) computerize \nand network the 1,215 LSGs, (ii) establish reliable technical support systems, and (iii) train \nthose involved. IKM has developed software to enable urban local bodies to implement the \ndouble-entry accounting system. Sankhya3 was scheduled for deployment in the five municipal \ncorporations by November 2004. LSGUD is implementing its comprehensive computerization \nprogram through a build-transfer-maintain model for a 5-year period. The build-transfer-maintain \noperator will (i) supply, deliver, install, commission, and maintain hardware in the 1,249 LSGs \nand related institutions; (ii) maintain the applications developed by IKM; (iii) provide training and \nsupport services; and (iv) handle relevant data entry. However, the transfer to double-entry \naccounting necessitates increased capacity building, independent verification of assets, and an \nasset valuation exercise at the level of urban local bodies.  \n \n8.  Subject to GoK initiating the reform process, the Government of India will provide funds \nfrom the Urban Reforms Incentive Fund; however, the amount will be insufficient to undertake \nthe accounting reform. Thus to achieve conversion of its accounts to double-entry accounting, \nGoK has requested ADB TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The objective of the TA is to help urban local bodies prepare and implement a carefully \ncoordinated  package  of  capacity-building  activities  required  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and \nautonomy of LSGs. The TA will assist the municipal corporations and selected municipalities to \n(i)  improve  their  capacity  to  organize,  record,  update,  and  manage  financial  and  other \ninformation on a routine basis; (ii) increase the efficiency and integrity of the data being \ncollected; and (iii) promote good governance in relation to financial management. This initiative \nwill help ensure the sustainability of the investments under the proposed Kerala Sustainable \nUrban Development Project.  \n                                                 \n3  Sankhya is the module designed to handle accounting and finance functions in the urban local bodies (receipts and \npayments, generation of necessary registers, reports, budgets, and financial statements). \n ", "  3\n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will cover pilot implementation of double-entry accounting in the five municipal \ncorporations and in two of the municipalities in Kerala. The experience of and lessons learned \nfrom the pilot towns can be used to promote long-term training and hands-on capacity building \nof the staff of other urban local bodies that will be switching over to double-entry accounting.  \n \n11.  The TA is expected to include the following:  \n \n(i)  Part A: study tour. Two representatives from each municipal corporation and \npilot municipalities will undertake an 8-day study tour of three cities in other \nstates that have successfully implemented a double-entry accounting system \n(e.g.,  Bangalore,  Chennai,  and  Hyderabad).  The  objective  is  for  the \nrepresentatives  to  directly  observe  the  implementation  of  a  double-entry \naccounting system in these cities and to learn from their experience of converting \nto the system.  \n \n  (ii)  Part  B:  confirmation  of  compliance  of  the  IKM  software  with  the \nrequirements  of  the  CAG\u2019s  task  force.  Sankhya  (para.  7)  supposedly \nincorporates the recommendations of the CAG Task Force on Accounting in \nUrban Local Bodies, but this needs to be verified. IKM will make any changes \nnecessary to comply with the CAG task force\u2019s requirements. \nPreparation of the methodology for valuing assets and liabilities. As the \nurban local bodies may not use a consistent methodology to value their assets \nand liabilities, the consulting firm needs to establish a methodology that all the \npilot towns will use (e.g., historic cost or current cost). \n \n  (iii)  Part  C:  independent  verification  and  valuation  of  asset  and  liability \naccounts.  To  ascertain  the  opening  balances  of  the  pilot  municipalities\u2019 \naccounts, an independent verification of assets and confirmation of liabilities is \nneeded, and this will be done by valuers deployed in the pilot towns. Following \nthe verification of assets, an independent valuer will determine the value of the \nassets for accounting purposes. This exercise will require a sign-off by the \nindependent chartered accountants engaged for the TA. \nActual  conversion  of  pilot  towns\u2019  accounting  records  to  double-entry \naccounting. Following the valuation and updating of their account balances, the \npilot towns can then implement the double-entry accounting system for recording \ntheir financial transactions. The chartered accountants will design a process for \nproviding on-the-job support to finance personnel in the pilot towns during the \nconversion to help ensure that transactions are recorded accurately, that data \nintegrity is maintained, and that accounting processes that support double-entry \nbookkeeping are defined. \n \n(iv)  Part D: preparation of an accounts audit manual in collaboration with the \nState  Performance  Audit  Office.  Following  the  conversion  to  double-entry \naccounting,  an  accounts  audit  manual  will  have  to  be  prepared  to  provide \nguidelines  for  recording  and  updating  transactions  in  the  system,  thereby \nensuring  data  integrity.  A  budgeting  manual  will  be  prepared  under  the \n ", "4  \nModernizing  Government  Program4  that  will  complement  the  accounts  audit \nmanual. It can also help instill financial discipline in the urban local bodies, as it \ncould  be  used  as  a  financial  planning  tool  for  balancing  revenues  against \nplanned expenditures. A training manual and module that captures the main \npoints of the accounts audit manual and lessons learned during the conversion \nexercise will also be prepared. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented by municipal staff with on-the-job support from consultants. \nAdditional activities to be undertaken during the TA will include (i) conducting workshops and (ii) \npreparing required reports. Upon completion of the TA, the pilot towns are expected to have \nimproved information linking revenues and expenditures, thereby enabling effective financial \nmanagement and planning for the delivery of municipal services. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost  of the TA is estimated at $1,058,000 equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange costs of $7,000 and local currency costs of $1,051,000 equivalent. The entire foreign \nexchange costs and $793,000 equivalent in local currency costs, totaling $800,000, will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Department for International Development funded by the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  TA  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  GoK  will \ncontribute the remaining local currency costs of $258,000 for office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff support, and other administrative expenses. GoK will also provide all the information \nrequired for the TA activities. A cost estimate and financing plan is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  LSGUD will be the executing agency for the TA and will be responsible for overall \ncoordination with ADB. The Directorate of Urban Affairs is a key implementing agency and the \nState Performance Audit Office will monitor TA activities. LSGUD will also provide the TA \nconsultants with administrative and technical support and will coordinate all activities under the \nTA with other government agencies. The consultants will report to the project director of the \nKerala Sustainable Urban Development Project,5 who will track the TA\u2019s overall progress. GoK \nwill  provide  adequate  office  space  for  the  consultants  along  with  sufficient  means  of \ncommunication. \n \n15.  The steering committee (para. 6) will be set up prior to the commencement of the TA, \ncomprised of (i) the secretary of GoK\u2019s Finance Department, (ii) the secretary of LSGUD, (iii) the \nstate\u2019s general auditor, (iv) the accountant general for accounts and entitlements, (v) the \nexaminer/director of Local Fund Audit, (vi) the chief executive officer of one of the municipal \ncorporations, (vii) the state performance auditor, (viii) the director of Information Kerala Mission \n(IKM), and (ix) a representative from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, India; and (x) a \nrepresentative from the Institute of Public Auditors of India. The secretary of LSGUD will chair \nthe steering committee and will be assisted by the team leader and deputy team leader \nengaged under the TA. The steering committee will meet at least once every 2 months during \nimplementation of the TA to discuss the consultants\u2019 progress (after the inception, midterm, and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.
