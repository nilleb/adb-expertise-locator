In 2006, the Government of India requested assistance from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to meet the large-scale tourism infrastructure requirements of the country. ADB, as \na  first  step,  provided  a  study1 to  assist  the  Government  in  developing  a  national  tourism \ninfrastructure development road map. The study, implemented from May to October 2007, has \nassessed the country\u2019s tourism endowments, market trends, high potential tourism circuits and \ndestinations,  and  their  infrastructure  requirements  over  the  next  10  years.  The  study  also \nprovided  a  broad  assessment  of  the  institutional  and  regulatory  constraints  to  sustainable \ntourism growth. The technical assistance (TA)2 is a culmination of this study, which is another \nstep  in  ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  India  for  developing  environmentally  sustainable,  culturally \nsensitive, and socially inclusive tourism in India. The TA responds to the Government request \nfor ADB\u2019s support in preparing a feasible tourism infrastructure development project for possible \nADB financing. The preliminary design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India\u2019s rich cultural and natural heritage, its ancient civilization, vibrant culture, many \nlandscapes, and rich biodiversity are of great interest to global tourist markets and give it a \ntremendous potential for tourism development. In 2002, the Government set a new policy for the \ndevelopment and regulation of the sector. The policy recognized the role of tourism in achieving \nsocioeconomic  goals  and  catalyzing  broad-based  growth.  It  also  made  a  commitment  to \n(i) mobilizing the state governments for tourism development, (ii) encouraging private sector \nprovision of tourism facilities and services supported by public sector infrastructure development, \nand  (iii)  providing  regulatory  support  to  ensure  environmentally  and  culturally  sustainable \ntourism.  \n \n3.  Tourism has grown remarkably during the 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132006), because of \nGovernment efforts that include (i) the placement of tourism as a priority in the national agenda, \n(ii) the promotion of India through the \u201cIncredible India\u201d campaign in overseas markets, (iii) \nrelative improvements in access and connectivity, and (iv) the opening of the tour operation \nsector to international operators. By the end of the 10th Plan, international tourist arrivals had \ngrown to 4.4 million with foreign exchange earnings estimated at $6.7 billion, while domestic \ntourism demand increased to an estimated 432 million. Overall, the tourism sector contributed \nabout 6% of GDP and employed 51.1 million persons directly and indirectly in the country.  \n \n4.  Despite considerable growth in tourism and good progress on policy and operational \nfronts, India\u2019s relative share of tourist arrivals and earnings from tourism remain insignificant in \nrelation to its tourism potential. Tourism development as a multisector activity is undermined by \nthe lack of coordinated effort and limited capacities of a large number of the agencies involved. \nDespite the recognition at the policy level of the critical role of the private sector in tourism, an \nenabling framework to mobilize the private sector for tourism infrastructure development, as well \nas developing complementary facilities, is not yet fully in place. All areas of tourism service \nprovision suffer from a significant shortage of human resources. However, the most critical \nconstraint to harnessing the tourism potential and sustained marketability of the country\u2019s vast \ntourism endowments is inadequate infrastructure. The basic connectivity infrastructure (air, road, \nrail, and water access) outside the main gateways and key destinations is inadequate. Utilities \nand civic services, such as water, sanitation, and solid waste management in many tourist \ndestinations do not provide safe and attractive environments for tourists. In many of the natural \n                                                 \n1  Component TA for Tourism Infrastructure Development under ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance Cluster to India for \nProject Processing and Capacity Development. Manila (TA 4814-IND). The component TA was approved 18 \nDecember 2006 by Director General, South Asia Department. The TA is now at draft final report stage. \n2   This appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 9 November 2007. \n ", "   2   \nand cultural heritage sites of importance to tourism, access remains poor, parking is limited, \npublic amenities are unfit for tourist use, and basic information and interpretation facilities are \nunavailable.  Moreover,  the  infrastructure  to  protect  and  interpret  key  cultural  and  natural \nheritage sites is not in place, and the small-scale tourism infrastructure to support community-\nbased  tourism  practices  is  generally  absent.  Inadequate  infrastructure  is  exacerbating  the \ncurrent concentrated pattern of tourism, thus hampering the full realization of potential gains \nfrom tourism to the larger community and the economy. Lack of infrastructure is also hindering \nthe diversification of tourism products and contributing to a highly seasonal pattern of tourism \nwith resulting adverse impact on viability of investments by the private sector.   \n \n5.  The study (footnote 1), conducted to prepare a tourism development road map for India, \ninvolved a strategic exercise based on desktop research, field visits, and consultation with \nstakeholders, including intense engagement with the private sector. The study assessed the \ncountry\u2019s tourism endowments and market trends; identified state and interstate tourism circuits3 \nas the units for integrated tourism infrastructure development; ranked the circuits based on \ncriteria,  including  tourism  potential  and  marketability;  and  determined  the  infrastructure \nrequirements4 within those circuits that need to be developed on a priority basis over the next 10 \nyears. The study concluded that the \u201ccircuit development\u201d approach adopted by the Government \nshould be maintained to diversify the current concentrated pattern of tourism and open up new \ndestinations now bypassed by tourists. The study also concluded that  that there is an urgent \nneed to improve the tourism infrastructure in an integrated manner in the key high-potential \ncircuits to (i) increase the marketability of the country\u2019s tourism assets; (ii) spread the benefits of \ntourism more widely to achieve inclusive tourism growth; (iii) reduce the highly seasonal pattern \nof  demand;  and  (iv) encourage  private  sector  investments  in  tourist  facilities  (e.g.,  hotels, \noutlets), without which tourism cannot grow.  \n \n6.  Moreover, the study recommended that, in parallel to infrastructure development, efforts \nneed to focus on (i) improving the institutional framework to ensure coordinated actions and \nconverge  the  resources  of  agencies  towards  common  goals  of  tourism  development;  (ii) \nensuring  the  sustainability  of  tourism  infrastructure,  services,  and  assets  created,  and \nenhancing conservation and management of heritage sites for environmentally and culturally \nsustainable  tourism;  (iii)  regulating  the  tourism  industry  to  achieve  better  standards;  (iv) \nmarketing  the  priority  circuits  as  single  destinations;  (v)  building  the  capacities  of  sector \ninstitutions and filling the gaps in skilled human resources in the sector; and (vi) mitigating the \npotential adverse affects of tourism on host communities and vulnerable groups. The study also \nsuggested that, given the limited financial resources and management capacities in the public \nsector, incentives should be established to engage the private sector and local communities in \nthe provision and operation and maintenance of tourism infrastructure and management of sites. \nFinally, the study recommended up-front support to enhance the project management and \nimplementation skills of relevant agencies.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA is required to develop a feasible tourism infrastructure development \nproject building on the findings of the study. The TA and the ensuing project will contribute to \nthe achievement of the targets in the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan and the road map \nbeing developed by the Government with ADB assistance. The TA and the ensuing project will \nrespond to the Government\u2019s request for ADB\u2019s support in its efforts to meet the large-scale \n                                                 \n3  A tourism circuit is defined as a route with more than one or two major destinations and sites, such that a tourist \nwho visits one destination is motivated to visit all other destinations in the circuit, resulting in increased arrivals to \nother destinations that are currently bypassed by tourism markets.  \n4  The tourism infrastructure requirements over the next 10 years are estimated at $10.6 billion, while the priority \ntourism infrastructure requirements over the next 5 years are $6.3 billion. These include connectivity infrastructure, \ndestination utility infrastructure, tourist facilities and amenities, heritage site infrastructure, and community-based \nsmall-scale tourism infrastructure.         \n ", "3 \ntourism infrastructure gap that has been identified as a critical constraint to harnessing the \ntremendous tourism potential of India. The TA and the ensuing project will fully support ADB\u2019s \ncurrent India country partnership strategy (CPS), whose major thrust is inclusive growth through \naddressing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  in  the  priority  sectors,  including  tourism,  with  greater \npotential to contribute to broad-based growth.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  is  intended  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its  targets  of  enhancing  the \nperformance of the tourism sector in an environmentally and culturally sustainable and socially \ninclusive manner. This would be reflected in (i) an increase in the number and length of stays of \ntourists,  (ii)  more  widely  distributed  income  and  benefits  from  tourism,  and  (iii)  enhanced \nmanagement of natural and cultural heritage sites of tourism importance. \n \n9.  The expected outcome and output of the TA is an agreed design for a feasible tourism \ninfrastructure development project that will contribute to the accomplishment of the following 10-\nyear road map objectives: (i) integrated development of high-priority tourism infrastructure in \nhigh-potential tourism circuits, resulting in enhanced connectivity and improved, environment, \nutilities, and tourist services; and (ii) improvement of institutional and regulatory frameworks that \nwill ensure coordinated efforts of multiple agencies, promote environmentally and culturally \nsustainable  and  socially  inclusive  tourism  development,  and  encourage  private  sector  and \ncommunity participation in tourism. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have two phases\u2014phase 1 will be dedicated to the preparation of the \nfeasibility of an investment package, and phase 2 will focus on activities to improve the project \nmanagement and implementation capacities and enhance readiness of relevant agencies for \nthe ensuing loan project implementation. \n \n11.  The output for phase 1 of the TA will be an investment proposal for possible ADB \nfinancing. More specifically, phase 1 will  \n(i)  finalize the state-level road map based on the national road map and confirm the \npriority subprojects;  \n(ii)  review and assess the feasibility of subprojects based on technical, institutional, \nenvironmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant factors;  \n(iii)  develop an institutional and regulatory reform agenda and proposals for capacity \nbuilding and human resource development building on the recommendations of \nthe national road map; and \n(iv)  prepare proposals for project implementation arrangements, and identify project \ncosts and a financing plan, as well as the project assistance modality.  \n \n12.  In formulating the overall project proposal, the TA will follow ADB guidelines in economic \nand  financial  assessment,  environment,  poverty,  and  social  dimensions  pertaining  to \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, and gender.      \n \n13.  The ensuing project is expected to include in high-priority circuits of the selected states \ninvestments in  \n(i)  tourism access and connectivity infrastructure (e.g., roads, transport, airports); \n(ii)  tourism destination utility infrastructure and services (e.g., drainage, sewerage, \nwater supply, and solid waste management); \n ", "   4   \n(iii)  natural and cultural heritage conservation and support infrastructure and services; \n(iv)  other  tourism  facilities  and  services  (e.g.,  tourism  service  centers,  tourist \ninformation facilities) and wayside amenities between major destinations and \nsites (rest rooms), and; \n(v)  community-based tourism schemes and approaches to enhance multiplier effects \nand more widely spread tourism\u2019s benefits to local communities.  \n \n14.  The  ensuing  project  is  also  expected  to  include  support  for  enhanced  tourism \ninstitutional and regulatory frameworks to  \n(i)  ensure coordinated actions between a number of agencies towards common \ngoals, \n(ii)  increase private sector participation in tourism infrastructure development and \nasset  management,  as  well  as  in  developing  complementary  facilities  (e.g., \naccommodation), \n(iii)  ensure environmentally and culturally sustainable tourism, and \n(iv)  capacity  building  and  human  resource  development  for  sustainable  tourism \nmanagement.  \n \n15.  Outputs from phase 2 will include enhanced project preparedness for implementation \nand improved project management and implementation capacities, with resulting timely and \neffective project implementation. Specifically, activities in phase 2 will include assistance in the \nestablishment of project management and implementation units for the ensuing loan project in \nthe  respective  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  training  of  relevant  staff  in  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  and  ADB  procedures,  and  assistance  in  enhancing  the \npreparedness of priority subprojects.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of India and the \nstate  governments  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $200,000  to  cover  the  remuneration  of \ncounterpart staff, provision of office accommodation and facilities, and local transportation for \ncounterpart staff. The Government of India has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing loan project. Details of the cost estimates and financing \narrangements are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Ministry of Tourism (MOT) will be the national-level focal agency, while the tourism \ndepartments in the selected states will be the executing agencies for the TA at the state level. \nThe MOT in Delhi and the tourism departments in the states will appoint qualified project \ndirectors to be supported by an adequate number of professional and support staff. Consultants \nwill be based in the states, and the executing agencies in the states will provide the consultants \nwith administrative and technical support and logistics. A national steering committee will be \nformed  with  participation  of  MOT  and  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  and  the \nrepresentatives  of  selected  states  to  provide  strategic  guidance  to  the  TA.  State-level \ncoordination committees will be set up to ensure coordination among and support from a \nnumber agencies involved in tourism infrastructure development. The committees will meet \nregularly to review TA progress and guide policy issues, as well as TA proposals at key stages, \nincluding inception, interim, and draft final stages. In addition, focal persons will be designated \nin each agency and municipal body involved in tourism infrastructure development to closely \nwork with the TA executing agency and provide sectoral inputs as necessary.   \n \n ", "5 \n18.  The TA will be undertaken by two teams of international and national consultants to be \nengaged as individuals in two consecutive stages in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  About  68  person-months  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  required  for  the  two  phases\u20149  person-months  of  input  from \ninternational consultants and 57 person-months from national consultants. The TA team for \nphase 1 will comprise the following international experts:  \n(i)  an expert in tourism planning and infrastructure development acting as a team \nleader (4 person-months), \n(ii)  a community-based tourism specialist (3), and  \n(iii)  an economist (2).  \n \n19.  The team for phase 1 will include a total of 29 person-months of inputs from the following \nnational consultants: \n(i)  two  tourism  infrastructure  engineering  (transport  and  municipal)  experts  (3 \nperson-months each);  \n(ii)  a cultural heritage conservation and management expert (3);  \n(iii)  an environment and natural heritage management expert (4);  \n(iv)  an expert in social development, including resettlement (6);  \n(v)  a tourism institutional and regulatory development expert (3);  \n(vi)  an expert in private sector participation (3); and  \n(vii)  an economic and financial analysis expert (4).  \n \n20.  The TA team for phase 2 will be made up of national experts (30 person-months), \nincluding  \n(i)  a project management specialist also acting as team leader (6),  \n(ii)  experts in procurement (6),  \n(iii)  three civil engineering experts (5 person-months each), and  \n(iv)  an expert in tourism institutional development (3).  \n \n21.  Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 4.  \n \n22.  Phase 1 will be implemented over 5 months from January 2008 to May 2008. The \nconsultants will submit an inception report, including the approach, scope, and work program, \nwithin 2 weeks; an interim report containing the state tourism infrastructure development road \nmaps and list of subprojects within 2 months; and a draft final report comprising the feasibility \nand investment package within 4 months of the start of the TA. Tripartite meetings will be held \nwith the Government of India, state governments, ADB, and the consultants to discuss reports. \nWorkshops also will be held to discuss the interim and draft final reports with stakeholders. A \nfinal report will be submitted 1 month after the Government and ADB comment on the draft final \nreport.  \n \n23.  Phase 2 of the TA will begin following the completion of phase 1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nTourism is one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest growing sectors, accounting for almost 11% of global gross domestic \nproduct. Properly planned and managed, the tourism sector can have a catalytic impact on poverty reduction. As \nevidenced in India and other countries, the sector generates more jobs than any other and thus contributes to local \nlivelihoods. In India, by 2006, it is estimated that the tourism sector sustained 51.1 million persons through direct and \nindirect employment. An important feature of the sector is that customers come to the product, thereby providing \nopportunities for multiplier effects. Tourism products mostly depend on natural capital, culture, and traditional skills and \narts that are generally the assets of the poor\u2014implying the great potential of the sector for poverty reduction. The \nGovernment of India recognized the role of the tourism sector in achieving socioeconomic goals and broad-based \ngrowth, and since 2002 has been placing tourism as a priority in the national agenda. The Government of India, with its \n11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012), again prioritized the tourism sector and made a commitment to meet the large-scale \ntourism infrastructure gaps, which are considered a major constraint to tapping the vast tourism potential of the country, \nas well as a constraint to a more inclusive pattern of tourism development. A major strategy of ADB\u2019s India CPS is \ninclusive growth through infrastructure development in those sectors that have greater potential to contribute to broad-\nbased growth, Accordingly, and in line with the Government\u2019s policy, ADB\u2019s India CPS identifies tourism infrastructure \ndevelopment as an area of priority.     \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.

If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? A social assessment will be undertaken in order to determine the possibility of \ndeveloping community-based tourism products. Community-based tourism can promote inclusive growth. The \nassessment will determine potential pro-poor components. It will also document potential negative social impacts \nthat will affect the vulnerable, and if there are any, a strategy to avoid or minimize such impacts, including \nprescribing mitigation measures, will be reported.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? As discussed, the project is designed to be inclusive and result in broad-based growth benefiting both \npoor and non-poor. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? A planning study conducted prior \nto the preparation of the TA, identified the needs for (i) small-scale tourism infrastructure,which will benefit \ncommunity-based tourism, and (ii) the larger-scale connectivity and utilities which will improve accessibility to and \nthe quality of life in the destinations for both tourists and host communities. \n \n ", "Appendix 2        9 \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? The project aims to ensure that the benefits of tourism are more widely distributed to result in inclusive \ngrowth. The access to benefits from infrastructure can be constrained by inadequate institutional mechanisms and \ncapacities of sector institutions. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders, their interests, and the way these \ninterests affect project risk and viability. Stakeholders will likely include (i) the central government ministries, i.e., the \nMinistry of Tourism and Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance; (ii) state tourism departments; \n(iii) state departments involved in tourism-related infrastructure development, e.g., Public Works Department, Airport \nAuthority; (iv) local government authorities, municipalities, and other service providers in selected tourism circuits \nand destinations; (v) private sector groups such as tour operators and existing and potential private investors; (vi) \nlocal communities; and (vii) local and international nongovernment organizations and bilateral agencies involved in \ntourism development in India. Stakeholders will also include people affected by the project in terms of resettlement \nand land acquisition, and the vulnerable.   \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \nBased on the above stakeholder analysis, a participation strategy will be prepared to outline how to involve various \nstakeholders at different stages of the project cycle. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring the fair representation of \neach group, especially the poor and the excluded. It is envisaged that the participation strategy will involve three \nlevels of participation and consultation instruments, i.e., national workshops, state-level workshops and consultative \nmeetings, and community-outreach activities. Inputs from the community-outreach activities at the local level will be \ndiscussed and evaluated at state consultative meetings and later shared at national workshops.    \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n      Information sharing           Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?      Yes          No    Please explain. A participation strategy (details above) will be \nprepared.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nA gender analysis will be conducted during project preparation to determine how project benefits can be maximized \nfor women in tourism development. The roles, responsibilities, needs, and interests of both men and women will be \nanalyzed. Men and women play different roles in the tourism industry. Women provide more up-front services and \nhave an important role at home. If managed properly, tourism can contribute to the promotion of gender equality and \nempower  women. Environmental improvements, better awareness of hygiene and food safety, improved skills \n(through training), and more representation in managerial positions could strengthen women\u2019s role and increase their \nparticipation in the industry. Women are also more vulnerable to negative social effects of tourism. A gender action \nplan (GAP) will be prepared under the TA to develop measures to ensure that (i) women actively participate in the \nproject design as well as project implementation, (ii) women and men benefit equally from the project, (iii) the project \naddresses the differential gender needs, and (iv) potential negative social impacts of tourism on women are avoided. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in \ndecision making?        Yes          No    Please explain. A GAP will be prepared (details above). \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes           No    Please explain.  \n \n ", "10       Appendix 2 \nIII.

The TA will have two phases, to be implemented in two consecutive stages by two teams \nof consultants (one for phase 1 and another for phase 2). The TA consultant teams will comprise \ninternational and national consultants to be recruited as individual consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nconsultants will be based in the states.      \n \nA.  Phase 1  \n \n1.  Part A: Finalization of State Road Maps for Tourism Development and \nConfirmation of Priority Tourism Infrastructure Requirements and Subprojects \n2.  Part A will take 2 months, including an inception stage of 2 weeks and an interim stage of \n6 weeks.  \n \n3.  In the first 2 weeks, the consultants will prepare and submit to ADB, the Government of \nIndia, and the states an inception report outlining the detailed TA work plan, methodology and \napproach, and individual consultant input requirements and tasks.  \n \n4.  Following inception, the consultants will finalize the state-level tourism development road \nmaps, building on the earlier study (TA 4814)1 on 10-year tourism development road map, within \n5 weeks. The state road maps will provide: \n \n(i)  state-specific tourism infrastructure requirements in the priority circuits of the state \nto be developed over the next 10 years. \n(ii)  state-specific nonphysical issues involved in tourism, including issues with respect \nto  (a) management  of  tourism  sites  and  destinations,  (b)  operation  and \nmaintenance of tourism infrastructure and services, (c) institutional and regulatory \nweaknesses  for  sustainable  development  and  management  of  tourism,  (d) \nmarketing and promotion, (e) financial and taxation policies that impede tourism \ngrowth, and (f) entry and movement of tourists in the country.      \n(iii)  state-specific proposals for: \n(a)  the institutional and regulatory development of tourism; \n(b)  capacity building for sustainable provision, operation and maintenance of \ntourism infrastructure and management of tourism destinations and cultural \nand natural heritage sites of tourism importance, including measures to \ni.  mobilize  private  sector  participation  in  tourism  infrastructure \ndevelopment and operation and maintenance as well as development of \ncomplementary facilities, e.g., hotels and accommodation;  \nii.  to safeguard natural and cultural heritage;  \niii.  to regulate the tourism industry to maintain acceptable standards in \ntourism products and services; and  \niv.  to address the current concentrated pattern of tourism and to distribute \nthe benefits from tourism growth more widely.  \n \n5.  The consultants will then reconfirm the priority tourism infrastructure requirements to be \naddressed under the ensuing project and the short list of subprojects for initial evaluation based \non a review of the 10-year road map, further consultations with the participating state government \ntourism organizations, state line departments, local governments, other development partners and \n                                                 \n1  Component TA for Tourism Infrastructure Development under ADB. 2006.
