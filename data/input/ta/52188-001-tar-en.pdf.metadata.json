INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the assessment of \neconomic corridor development (ECD) potential among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, \nwith focus on major cities of Shymkent, Tashkent, and Khujand and surrounding oblasts of \nTurkestan, Tashkent, and Sughd. The TA was designed in response to demand from developing \nmember countries (DMCs) under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram to explore new ECDs to create business development opportunities, employment, and \nentrepreneurship, as ECD is an important element in the implementation of the CAREC 2030 \nstrategy.1 The TA builds on ongoing Almaty\u2212Bishkek Economic Corridor (ABEC) work supported \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nRegional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020, which advocates ECD as effective means to \nenhance competitiveness in connected markets.3 The TA participating countries are also covered \nby the Belt and Road Initiative geography.4  \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Central Asia is undergoing an economic recovery and benefiting from positive regional \ndynamics  with  the  opening  of  Uzbekistan.  Under  the  new  circumstances,  Central  Asian \ncountries\u2014particularly Uzbekistan and neighboring Kazakhstan and Tajikistan\u2014are keen to \nharness the potential of regional cooperation and integration (RCI) to promote growth, create jobs, \nand improve the quality of life of their citizens. Trade has been identified in these countries as an \nenabling driver in diversifying economies from a narrow-base (overreliance on natural resources) \ninto a more broad-based and sustainable growth model, for enhanced export competitiveness. \nFurther, the growing trend of regional and global production networks, value chains, and new \ntechnologies,  coupled  with  improved  information  and  communication  technology,  create \nnecessary conditions for Central Asia and CAREC member countries to increase participation in \nregional and global trade. A CAREC Integrated Trade Agenda 2030 is being formulated to \nfacilitate this process. 5  \n \n3.  All these provide favorable conditions for Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to \npursue cross-border ECD cooperation to increase trade integration. ECD works by exploiting the \nstrong  growth  effects  of  spatial  economic  development  featured  by  scale  economies, \nagglomeration, diversification, and specialization of economic activities. ECD requires necessary \nphysical conditions and seamless policy coordination to achieve desired effects. Showcased by \nsuccessful ECDs in Asia\u2014e.g., Malaysia\u2019s five-ECD national development strategy and India\u2019s \nDelhi\u2212Mumbai Industrial Corridor for manufacturing and exports\u2014as well as the ABEC pilot under \nCAREC, and considering the geographic contiguity for spatial planning and development, the \nShymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and surrounding Turkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd oblasts were \nidentified as another possible ECD to be explored under CAREC. 6   \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Operationalizing Economic Corridors in Central Asia: A Case Study of the Almaty\u2212Bishkek Corridor. \nManila (Box: Economic Corridor Development in Practice, p. 8). Shymkent is administratively a city of Republican \nsignificance of Kazakhstan, and is geographically under the Turkestan Oblast; Tashkent is administratively the capital \n ", "2 \n \n4.  The Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and surrounding Turkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd \noblasts are within easy access of each other: 100 kilometers between Shymkent and Tashkent, \nand 160 kilometers between Tashkent and Khujand. These cities and oblasts host a relatively \nlarge population: roughly 9 million people or 15% of the total population of Central Asia are within \nthe Turkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd oblasts.7 They are also strategically connected to international \nmarkets: Shymkent is located in the international crossroads of Europe\u2212East Asia (CAREC \nCorridor 1) and Russian Federation\u2212Middle East and South Asia (CAREC Corridor 3), and \nTashkent and Khujand are tourist centers. Moreover, the three cities and surrounding oblasts \nenjoy  a  level  of  economic  complementarity,  particularly  in  agriculture  and  food,  based  on \nnationwide  trade  data.  For  example,  Kazakhstan  exports  agri-food  and  meat  products  to \nUzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  and  imports  vegetables  and  fruits  from  them.8  Another  clear \ncomplementarity is the cross-border labor mobility facilitated by the close historical, cultural, and \nlinguistic ties among the three countries.    \n   \n5.  There are growing economic interactions among the three countries: mutual trade turnover \nbetween Uzbekistan and Tajikistan grew by 35% and amounted to $160 million for the first half of \n2018. However, policy coordination on spatial economic development is limited, including on \ndevelopment of economic and industrial clusters in the Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and \nsurrounding oblasts. There is significant potential to harness increased economic opportunities\u2014\nfor example, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan agreed to increase trade to $5 billion by 2020 from the \nexpected $3 billion in 2018\u2014if policies to integrate manufacturing value chains and synergize \neconomic and industrial clusters are well-coordinated among the three cities and surrounding \noblasts.  \n \n6.  Physical connectivity within the six CAREC corridors (Corridors 2 and 3 cover the three \ncities and oblasts) has been improved with major investment in road infrastructure in recent years \n(e.g.,  the  Shymkent-Tashkent  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  financed  by  ADB).  However, \nchallenges still exist, especially at border-crossing points, including substandard physical facilities \nand uncoordinated procedures, which weaken cross-border trade flows. Moreover, trade policies \nand regulations, if harmonized\u2014particularly among the member (Kazakhstan) and nonmembers \n(Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)\u2014can reduce trade costs \nand lower additional costs for non-EAEU firms in complying with EAEU requirements.     \n \n7.   Private sector participation is key to the success of ECDs in developing business and \ncreating employment. However, it currently remains limited in cross-border activities in CAREC \ndue to information asymmetry, weak incentives and insufficient conditions for investment, poor \naccess  to  financing,  and  lack  of  effective  dialogue  with  public  sector  stakeholders.  These \nconstraints must be eased to improve the environment for cross-border investment among \nShymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and surrounding oblasts.  \n \n8.  While ECD is gaining increased interest in the CAREC region, it is a relatively new \ndevelopment concept. Wider diffusion to the various communities and societies will help their \nunderstanding of the connections between ECD and growth, particularly the core concepts and \nkey conditions for economic planning and development under a regional context. Thus, enhanced \nknowledge sharing on ECD-related experiences, including with DMCs under other subregional \n                                                \ncity of Uzbekistan, and is geographically under the Tashkent Oblast; Khujand is both administratively and \ngeographically under the Sughd Oblast of Tajikistan. \n7  ADB staff estimation. \n8  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Country Profile.  \n   http://unctadstat.unctad.org/CountryProfile/en-GB/index.html.  \n ", "3 \n \nprograms, will help increase awareness and knowledge of ECD in the CAREC region in a \ncoordinated manner. \n \n9.   This TA is designed to support scoping and prefeasibility studies to explore the ECD \npotentials of Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and surrounding Turkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd \noblasts. The TA will support spatial economic development including trade analysis among the \nthree  cities  and  oblasts  to  identify  possible  economic  complementarities,  including  (i) \nagglomeration of certain economic activities, (ii) scale economies in focus sectors and/or areas \nand products, (iii) integration of manufacturing value chains, and (iv) economic and industrial \ncluster development for specialized products. It will identify major constraints, gaps, and weak \nlinks\u2014in  terms  of  physical  infrastructure  connectivity  (e.g.,  information  and  communication \ntechnology constraints) and policy environment (e.g., for private sector investment), including \ninvestment needed\u2014in fully exploiting economic complementarities through an envisaged ECD. \nThe TA will also support workshops and seminars that promote ECD-related knowledge sharing \nand awareness raising to enhance understanding and knowledge of ECD in the CAREC region. \nAs ECD has great potential in creating job opportunities for women by participating in cross-border \nactivities (e.g., tourism and trade), the above-mentioned studies will attend to gender equality as \na crosscutting issue in the ECD analysis. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: RCI in the CAREC region strengthened.9 The \nTA will have the following outcome: ECD prospects among Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities \nand surrounding oblasts better informed.10  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Prospects  and  potentials  of  increased  trade  integration  among \nShymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and surrounding Turkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd oblasts \nanalyzed. The TA will support a scoping study on trade analysis among the three cities and \nsurrounding oblasts (including Shymkent\u2013Tashkent, with surrounding Turkestan and Tashkent \noblasts, and Tashkent\u2212Khujand, with surrounding Tashkent and Sughd oblasts). The TA will focus \non major goods and services trade and identify (i) complementarities and competitiveness of \nsectors and/or areas and products to fully exploit trade potentials and (ii) major constraints, gaps, \nand weak links in terms of optimal physical infrastructure connectivity and policy environment to \nfacilitate trade integration. The study will include policy recommendations and investment needs \nto leverage complementarities to better integrate economic activities for increased trade. \n \n12.  Output 2:  Prospects and potentials of an envisaged Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand \ntripartite  economic  corridor  development  with  possible  expansion  to  surrounding \nTurkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd oblasts analyzed. The TA will support a prefeasibility study to \nassess  the  potential  of  Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand  tripartite  ECD, with  expansion  to  the \nsurrounding Turkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd oblasts. Building on the results of output 1, the TA team, \nthrough the study, will analyze economic interactions and trade links among the three cities and \nsurrounding oblasts including between two pairs of cities and oblasts (Shymkent\u2212Tashkent, with \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n10  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n \nTurkestan and Tashkent oblasts, and Tashkent\u2212Khujand, with Tashkent and Sughd oblasts). The \nTA will identify possible sectors and/or areas and products to be synergized, and measures to \nenhance complementarities for better integration of economic activities. The TA will also identify \nmajor constraints, gaps, weak links, and investments needed. Policy recommendations will \ndiscuss appropriate ECD modalities that fit the development context of the three cities and \nsurrounding oblasts, and an institutional framework with roles and responsibilities of different \nplayers and stakeholders. The TA will assess possible linkage with the ABEC and agricultural \nactivities in the Fergana Valley to create wider economic benefits in Central Asia. The TA may \nalso explore the potentials of additional ECDs, depending on the progress of the study and based \non requests from other CAREC DMCs. \n \n13.  Output 3: Economic corridor development related knowledge sharing strengthened \nand  awareness  raised.  The  TA  will  support  workshops,  conferences,  and  stakeholder \nconsultations on ECD-related knowledge sharing and awareness raising in the CAREC member \ncountries. Views and comments will be solicited from governments and other stakeholders of the \nthree target countries and the CAREC community, including private sector practitioners, on ECD \nprospects and benefits in the CAREC region, to facilitate sound understanding of appropriate \napproaches for developing ECD. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n  \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund, and administered \nby ADB.11  The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of the Central and West Asia Department (CWRC) will implement the TA by working \nclosely  with  the  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  sector  divisions;  resident  missions  in \nKazakhstan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Tajikistan;  and  other  related  operations  and  knowledge \ndepartments  (e.g.,  the  East  Asia  Department  and  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCooperation Department). CWRC will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize \nworkshops and conferences; and monitor the TA implementation in coordination with CAREC \nconsultants  based  in  Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Tajikistan.  It  will  also  collaborate  with \ninternational  development  partners  such  as  the  United  Nations  Industrial  Development \nOrganization and the World Trade Organization in carrying out selected activities under the TA.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 26 months, from October 2018 to December 2020. ADB \nwill engage about 29 person-months of international and 66 person-months of national consulting \nservices during the TA implementation period. International consultants will include (i) ECD \nexperts, including a team leader, to provide technical advice, analytical support, and policy \nrecommendations on the ECD potentials of Shymkent\u2212Tashkent\u2212Khujand cities and surrounding \nTurkestan\u2212Tashkent\u2212Sughd oblasts, and (ii) a trade expert to analyze trade links among the three \ncities  and  surrounding  oblasts  and  provide  policy  recommendations  for  increased  trade \nintegration through possible ECD. National consultants based at ADB headquarters and in the \nthree CAREC member countries will include (i) four research assistants to provide technical \nsupport and inputs, including field and local support, to the international consultants and the \n                                                \n11 The fund was originally named \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d in \nthe 2005 Board paper. \n ", "5 \n \nCAREC Unit within CWRC; and (ii) a project coordinator to provide operations and administrative \nsupport to the international consultants and the CAREC Unit. ADB will also engage international \nand national resource persons to provide inputs, review reports, and participate as presenters, \nfacilitators, and/or discussants in related meetings and workshops.12  \n \n17.  ADB will recruit consultants as individuals and not through a firm since (i) prospective \nconsultants will perform activities in three different countries with different development contexts, \nand (ii) the specific expertise and experience required\u2014for example, a wide range of economic \nand sector policy experience, operational experience, and specific knowledge of the CAREC \nProgram and Central Asia countries\u2014are unlikely available in a firm.
