INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance the \npolicies and practices regarding the safe and sustainable management and reuse of fly ash \nfrom municipal solid waste incineration plants in the PRC.1 During a TA fact-finding mission on \n17 March 2015 and in further communications, agreement was reached with the government on \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing plan, and outline \nterms of reference for the consulting services of the TA. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The achievements and positive impacts of industrialization and urbanization in the PRC \nsince the late 1970s have been remarkable. The PRC\u2019s reform and opening-up policies as well \nas its economic miracle have lifted millions out of poverty and created wealth and an urban \nmiddle class. The urbanization ratio increased from 19.4% in 1978 to 53.7% in 2013, and the \nurban population rose to nearly 700 million in 2013. The number of cities rose from 193 in 1978 \nto 658 in 2013, and the number of townships rose from 2,173 to 20,113 in the same period. \nRural\u2013urban migration is expected to continue, resulting in a projected urban population of \n816 million  by  2020  and  more  than  1  billion  by  2030.  However,  rapid  urbanization  in \ncombination with double-digit growth in the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product came at a heavy toll \non  the  environment.  The  environmental  impact  of  urban  development  caused  by  polluting \nindustries,  urban  sprawl,  unsustainable  transport,  consumption-based  lifestyles,  and  illegal \ndumping of solid waste is massive. The effects are environmental degradation, loss of natural \nland and farmland, and pollution of air, water, and soil. These have become very serious \nchallenges to livability and pose severe threats to human and environmental health, particularly \nin large cities in the PRC, which generally suffer from serious air pollution, water pollution, and \nenvironmental degradation.  \n \n3.  Solid waste generation and illegal dumping in public areas\u2014e.g., streets, plazas, parks, \nriverbanks,  lakes,  open  fields,  forests\u2014are  key  environmental  challenges  that  cities  and \nsurrounding suburban and peri-urban areas are exposed to. The lack of adequate solid waste \nmanagement causes numerous problems that jeopardize public and environmental health, such \nas pests, clogged-up drainage systems, polluted environments, and degradation of river and \nlake ecology. Although the 3R principle of reduce, reuse, and recycle is a commonly agreed \nobjective for solid waste management, and while much progress has been made, many cities \nfind it ever more difficult to implement an effective solid waste management system. Further, \nsolid waste generation increases disproportionately faster than urban population growth, mainly \nbecause the rising urban middle class is pushing up per capita consumption levels. Integrated, \nefficient, and sustainable municipal solid waste management, municipal waste incineration, and \nsustainable management of fly ash and slag are the key goals that PRC cities need to achieve, \nwhich will also contribute to better environmental quality across the country. Managing fly ash is \nparticularly  challenging  because  it  often  contains  toxic  components  and  is  considered \nhazardous waste depending on the characteristics of the waste, the incineration technology, \nand operations. The magnitude of the task is significant. For example, fly ash amounts to an \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan as Demonstration Project of Sustainable Disposal of \nUrban Bulk-Hazardous Waste\u2013A Case Study in Tianjin. ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, 2015\u20132017. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 July 2015.  \n ", "2   \nestimated 3.2 million tons per year in the PRC, 300,000 tons per year in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nHebei region, and 50,000 tons per year in Tianjin. \n \n4.  The past 35 years of urbanization in the PRC also showcase a remarkable evolution of \nknowledge,  environmental  laws,  administrative  regulations,  and  practices  in  solid  waste \nmanagement.  The  authorities  are  starting  to  consider  the  complete  material  and  resource \nchain\u2014from product design, product manufacturing, component reuse, solid waste segregation, \ncollection and transfer, resource recovery, reuse, recycling, to final disposal on dumpsites and, \nmore recently, well-managed sanitary landfills. In recent years, limitations of land in growing and \nsprawling urban areas became apparent and made it difficult for cities to locate solid waste \nlandfill sites. A growing number of cities are since regarding waste incineration as a more land-\nuse-efficient solution. An additional benefit can be achieved when producing electricity from the \nexcess heat in so-called waste-to-energy plants. As part of the PRC\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, \n2006\u20132010, the National Development and Reform Commission issued a renewable energy \ndevelopment plan aiming at waste incineration power generation capacity of 500,000 kilowatts \nby 2010. The Master Plan for National Urban Domestic Solid Waste Treatment Facilities under \nthe Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 aims to increase the capacity of urban incineration of \ndomestic waste by 35% nationwide.3 Thus, an increasing number of municipal solid waste \nincineration plants (MSWIPs) were built in the PRC, amounting to an estimated 200 at present, \nand 100 more are planned. While incineration solves some of the solid waste management \nproblems, it leaves large amounts of fly ash and slag in need of environmentally sound reuse \nand/or sustainable final disposal. In Tianjin, a pilot facility to treat fly ash and convert it into a \nreusable resource for construction materials is under way, and is expected to be in operation by \nthe end of 2015. \n \n5.  MSWIPs have been introduced and technically refined in Germany, Japan, the Republic \nof Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States, among others. In the early days of waste \nincineration, toxic pollutants such as dioxins had caused serious threats to public health, but \ncurrent  technologies\u2014including  sophisticated  filtration  and  detoxification  systems\u2014make  it \npossible to situate a MSWIP in urban areas, and to minimize their impact on environmental \nquality, especially air quality. Solutions to safe management and reuse of fly ash and slag have \nbeen developed and mainstreamed in the aforementioned countries. Fly ash and slag are being \nretrieved, metals and other deposits extracted, and the residue is being reused as supplements \nto building materials such as asphalt, cement, and bricks. This is seen as one of the sustainable \nsolutions for final disposal of fly ash and slag, compared with disposal in sanitary landfill sites or \nsubgrade deposit areas. In the PRC, research, standards, and administrative regulations for \npollution control from MSWIPs and for sustainable management of slag from MSWIPs have \nbeen successfully developed and applied.4 However, sustainable use and final disposal of fly \nash remain a challenge. In some cases, fly ash is categorized as hazardous waste and is \ntreated  depending  on the  composition  of the waste  that  is  burned  and  depending  on  the \nincineration  process  and  temperature.  Research  of  policies  and  practices  abroad,  and  of \nlessons to be applied to the PRC MSWIPs, as well as the development of technical guidance, \nstandardization, and administrative regulations are urgently needed. \n \n6.  The TA is in line with the key policies of the government's Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u2013\n2015,  which  supports  increased  incineration  of  total  treated  solid  waste  and  strategically \nsupports key initiatives planned in the PRC\u2019s National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020. \n                                                \n3  Master Plan for National Urban Domestic Solid Waste Treatment Facilities under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (File \nNo. 23 of the General Office of the State Council, 2012). \n4  One of the key standards is the \u201cSolid waste incineration pollution control standard\u201d (GB18485-2001). \n ", "  3 \nThe TA is aligned with the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC to achieve environmentally sustainable \ngrowth.5 By supporting the PRC\u2019s efforts to promote emission reduction and management of \ntoxic waste, this TA is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020.6 The TA \ncomplements  ADB  urban  sector  loans  that  include  solid  waste  management  components. \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department supports waste-to-energy plants in the PRC, and \nthe TA will help boost their environmental sustainability and safety. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved urban environmental quality in the PRC, aligned with the \nPRC\u2019s  National  New-Type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020.  The  outcome  will  be  improved \nsustainability of fly ash management from municipal solid waste incineration in the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA is expected to have three outputs that will contribute to the achievement of the \noutcome  and  impact:  (i)  technical  standards  for  safe  capture,  processing,  reuse,  and \nsustainable  disposal  of  fly  ash  from  MSWIPs  developed;  (ii)  policy  recommendations  and \nimplementation action plan for safe reuse and sustainable disposal of fly ash from MSWIPs \nprepared; and (iii) capacity on technologies and establishing an information and service center \non advanced sustainable MSWIP fly ash management in the PRC improved. \n \n9.  During  TA  implementation,  the  current  domestic  laws,  administrative  regulations, \npractices, and technologies for the reuse and sustainable disposal of fly ash from MSWIP will be \nanalyzed and documented using selected facilities and management practices in Tianjin and \nBeijing as sample cases. A review and documentation of international best practices; case \nstudies on technologies, materials, and products for safe and sustainable reuse of fly ash; \nregulatory frameworks; and institutional responsibilities will provide a basis for comparison. \nLessons will be drawn and recommendations will be made to apply successful and proven \ntechnical  solutions,  specifications,  and  standardization  in  the  PRC.  To  ensure  smooth \nimplementation,  comments  from  the  Tianjin  Municipal  Government  (TMG),  the  national, \nprovincial,  and  other  municipal  governments  on  the  technical  standards  and  policy \nrecommendations will be considered. The capacity of the Tianjin Safe Disposal of Municipal \nSolid Waste Incineration Fly Ash Technology Engineering Center (TEC) will be strengthened to \nset up an information and service hub on fly ash management in the PRC, since it is the only \nentity with such specialized scope in the PRC. The capacity of the parties concerned will be \nstrengthened through training, seminars, and workshops. Dissemination workshops, training, \nand the service platform are designed to promote private sector engagement in the industry of \nsafe and sustainable reuse of fly ash. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $375,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
