An environmental and social safeguards \nframework has been developed to assist in the environmental and \nsocial safeguards assessment of subprojects during implementation \nof  the  Project  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  all  relevant  ADB \npolicies. \n   \nProject Description  Component A will use ADB\u2019s OCR funds of $82 million to provide \nfinancing to the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) for \nrelending  to  the  Infrastructure  Development  Company  Limited \n(IDCOL)  to  finance  private  sector-sponsored  large  infrastructure \nsubprojects  with  a  subproject  size  of  more  than  $30 million. \nComponent B will provide Asian Development Fund (ADF) support \nof $50 million equivalent to the Government for relending in local \ncurrency to IDCOL to finance small and medium-sized infrastructure \nsubprojects  primarily  located  in  rural  and  semiurban  areas, \nespecially  in  the  energy  sector.  IDCOL\u2019s  total  exposure  to  an \nindividual small and medium-sized infrastructure subproject will not \nexceed $10 million. Component C will provide ADF funding of $33 \nmillion equivalent for the purpose of promoting renewable energy \nsystems in Bangladesh. IDCOL will finance the set-up of renewable \nenergy  systems  such  as  solar  home  systems  and/or  biomass \ninstallations through a microfinance-based, direct sales program. \n   \nRationale  Over the last few years, public investments in the infrastructure \nsector in Bangladesh have remained stagnant, consisting of only \n6%\u20137% of gross domestic product. The Global Competitiveness \nReport 2007\u20132008 ranked Bangladesh 120 out of 131 countries for \nits quality of infrastructure. Persistent neglect of public infrastructure \nservices has hampered domestic economic growth and restrained ", "ii \nBangladesh  from  living  up  to  its  full  potential  from  a  regional \nstandpoint of being able to assume the role of a transport and \ntransshipment  hub  for  the  subregion.  Furthermore,  inadequate \ninfrastructure  limits  the  country\u2019s  opportunities  for  integrating \neconomically with its neighbors. To meet the growth targets of the \nGovernment, the current level of investments in infrastructure has to \nbe raised substantially. \n \nCognizant of its role in the changing economic and technological \nclimate for catalyzing infrastructure development, the Government \nis pursuing infrastructure development through (i) developing the \nrequisite  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  contractual \narrangements; (ii) thorough planning and coordination, particularly \nwith respect to the public\u2013private interface; and (iii) assuring the \nquality  of  infrastructure.  In  pursuit  of  these, policy  actions  have \nbeen taken across sectors for reducing risks and by enhancing the \nenabling environment, thereby providing stability to long-term cash \nflows  and  assisting  in  building  capacity  for  project  appraisal  to \nfacilitate financing. \n \nIDCOL  is  the  only  financial  institution  in  Bangladesh  which  is \nmandated and specializes in providing long-term debt financing for \ninfrastructure and renewable energy. The recent strengthening of \nIDCOL\u2019s balance sheet (through several capital injections by the \nGovernment)  to  support  the  company\u2019s  expansion  plans  and \ngrowing balance sheet demonstrates the Government\u2019s intention to \ncontinue supporting the company and its mandate. At present, no \nother financial institution in Bangladesh is in a position to catalyze \ninternational funds and know-how for infrastructure financing. \n \nThe  proposed  PPIDF  will  directly  support  the  Government\u2019s \ninfrastructure development agenda by providing (currently scarce) \nlong-term funds for infrastructure financing. With ADB\u2019s assistance \nthrough  the  facility,  IDCOL  will  be  able  to  provide  funds  at \ncommercial  terms  with  maturity  of  more  than  20  years  for \ninfrastructure  subprojects,  which  are  otherwise  currently  not \navailable from the market. \n \nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  and \ncomplements  ADB\u2019s  parallel  initiatives  in  governance,  capital \nmarkets  developments,  and  the  promotion  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPP), all of which contribute to creating an enabling \nenvironment for infrastructure development in Bangladesh. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the PPIDF will be an improved infrastructure sector in \nBangladesh through increased private sector participation, thereby \npromoting  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  Private \nparticipation  offers  significant  potential  to  speed  up  the  pace  of \ninfrastructure  development,  expand  access,  and  deliver  efficient \nservices. The design of the PPIDF serves to attract commercial \nfinancing,  thereby  reducing  the  pressure  on  the  public  budget. \n ", "iii \nPrivate sector participation will also introduce new technologies and \nhelp increase the efficiency of the infrastructure sector by ensuring \ncommercial orientation and discipline at the subproject level. The \nPPIDF\u2019s outcome is to help address the infrastructure deficiencies \nin  Bangladesh  through  providing  long-term  debt  financing  and \ncatalyzing private sector participation.  \n \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  $165  million  facility  will  help  catalyze \ninvestments of about $600 million from the private sector to finance \napproximately 15\u201320 PPP subprojects, which will add at least 900 \nmegawatts (MW) of power generation capacity in the private sector \nand  provide  electricity  to  approximately  100,000  additional \nhouseholds  through  IDCOL's  renewable  energy  programs.  The \nmain targets and indicators are (i) the number of high-quality and \nviable  infrastructure  assets sponsored  by  international  and  local \nfirms, and (ii) the financing of roughly 100,000 SHSs, 15 biomass \ninstallations, and 100 biogas power plants covering all regions of \nBangladesh. PPIDF also seeks to develop capacity of IDCOL to (i) \nappraise subprojects, (ii) manage the renewable energy program, \nand  (iii)  implement  the  environment  and  social  safeguards \nframework. In addition, line ministries will be supported to develop \nPPP frameworks.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  The financing plan assumes that IDCOL will provide financing up to \nits maximum allowed investment limit of 40% of total subproject \ncost to each subproject (while the sponsor will be required to inject \nat least 20% equity), therefore catalyzing 60% from private sector \nsponsors and other financial institutions. Typically, IDCOL\u2019s share \nwill be smaller, varying between 10% and 30%, to reflect the fact \nthat most infrastructure transactions are financed by a consortium \nof financial institutions, and IDCOL will be just one among many. \nHence, IDCOL\u2019s catalytic effect is expected to be much larger. \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local \nSource  Exchange  Currency \nAsian Development  82.0  0.0 \nBank (OCR)     \nPrivate Sector Sponsors  328.0  0.0 \nand Banks (large     \nsubprojects)     \nAsian Development  83.0  0.0 \nBank (ADF)     \nPrivate Sector Sponsors  0.0  332.0 \nand Banks (SMIPs and     \nrenewable energy)     \nIslamic Development  85.0  15.0 \nBank     \n  Total  578.0  347.0 \n  ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources, SMIP = \nsmall and medium-sized infrastructure subproject. \n ", "iv \n   \nParallel Financing  The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has allocated concessional \nfinancing of $15 million on similar terms as ADB\u2019s ADF loan for \nIDCOL\u2019s solar energy program. Based on a further review of a well-\ndeveloped pipeline of large power and infrastructure subprojects, \nIDB is processing an OCR-type funding of up to $85 million for the \nfinancing  of  eligible  large  infrastructure  subprojects.  Approval  by \nIDB\u2019s board is expected to be obtained by January 2009. IDB\u2019s \ncofinancing  will  be  provided  under  a  parallel  cofinancing \narrangement. \n   \nFacility Amount and  (i)  Lending terms of component A (large infrastructure \nTerms  subprojects)  \n \nThe OCR loan will be provided to the Government with a 25-year \nterm, including a 5-year grace period, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending \nfacility, a commitment  fee of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreements. The OCR \nloan proceeds will be relent to IDCOL in dollars. The relending rate \nwill be the London interbank offered rate plus 100 basis points for a \nterm of 20 years for the purpose of foreign currency disbursements \npursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement with such other terms and \nconditions acceptable to ADB. \n \nOnlending by IDCOL to eligible subprojects will be at interest rates \nthat reflect IDCOL\u2019s cost of funds plus a spread to cover transaction \ncosts and risks. Subloans will be on full commercial and competitive \nterms at IDCOL\u2019s discretion. \n \n  (ii)  Lending terms of component B (small and medium-sized \ninfrastructure subprojects) \n \nThe  ADF  loan  will  be  provided  to  the  Government  as  Special \nDrawing  Rights  equivalent  in  a  suitable  currency  and  relent  to \nIDCOL in taka. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nGovernment  will  make  the  loan  available  to  IDCOL  under  a \nsubsidiary loan agreement at the relending rate of the Bangladesh \nBank Rate with a term of 20 years. IDCOL will onlend the proceeds \nfrom  the  ADF  loan  under  this  component  at  market  rates.  The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n(iii)  Lending terms of component C (renewable energy \nsubprojects) \n \nThe  ADF  loan  will  be  provided  to  the  Government  as  Special \nDrawing  Rights  equivalent  in  a  suitable  currency  and  relent  to \nIDCOL in taka. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum \n ", "v \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nGovernment will make the loan available to IDCOL at a fixed rate of \n3% or such higher rate as may be necessary to ensure that IDCOL\u2019s \nonlending spread to its sub-borrowers is not more than 300 basis \npoints, under a subsidiary loan agreement with a term of 20 years. \nThe proposed onlending terms reflect current market rates for this \ntype of intervention (the financing of renewable energy installations \nin rural areas in Bangladesh). The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk. \n   \nLoan Closing Dates  The loan closing date for the OCR loan and the ADF loan will be 31 \nDecember 2013. \n   \nSubproject and Sub- Each  subproject  and  sub-borrower  will  satisfy  at  all  times  the \nBorrower Selection  subproject and sub-borrower selection criteria which include, inter \nCriteria  alia, appraisal for technical, economic, and commercial viability. In \naddition, each sub-borrower will (i) be selected in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime); (ii) have adequate resources and financial capability to raise \nresources to complete and operate the relevant qualified subproject \nsuccessfully;  (iii)  not  be  in  default  on  any  prior  loan  to  any \nparticipating members of the consortium including IDCOL or any \nbank or nonbank financial institution in Bangladesh; (iv) be able to \nprovide  security  as  required  by  the  consortium  of  lenders;  (v) \nmaintain appropriate financial record of income and expenditure to \nthe satisfaction of ADB and IDCOL; and (vi) comply with ADB\u2019s and \nnational  and  state  policies  and  laws,  and  regulations  relating  to \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Finance, acting through its Finance Division, will be \nArrangements  the executing agency, and IDCOL will be the implementing agency \nof  the  Project.  Policy  direction  and  strategic  oversight  will  be \nprovided by IDCOL\u2019s board of directors. A project management unit \nwill be established by IDCOL to monitor the screening and selection \nof  subprojects.  In  addition,  the  project  management  unit  will  be \nresponsible for developing and implementing a project performance \nmonitoring system.  \n   \nProcurement  For  subprojects  to  be financed  out  of  component  A,  IDCOL  will \nrequire its sub-borrowers to adopt internationally competitive bidding \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Government\u2019s \nguidelines, policies, and regulations. \n \nFor subprojects to be financed out of components B and C, ADB will \nencourage IDCOL to require its sub-borrowers to adopt international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) when \nthe amount of the investment is unusually large and economy and \nefficiency can be gained by following such procedures. \n \n ", "vi \nFor procurement of goods and services to be financed by subloans \nout of the loan proceeds, the sub-borrower will ensure, and certify to \nADB if requested, that goods and services obtained are suitable for \nthe subloans, that the price paid is least-cost, and that account is \ntaken of factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and the reliability \nof goods. \n   \nDisbursement  The  Government  will  establish  three  imprest  accounts  with  the \nArrangements  Bangladesh Bank, one for the OCR loan (component A) and one for \neach of the two components under the ADF loan (components B and \nC). The initial amount deposited into each imprest account shall not \nexceed 10% of each loan or estimated expenditures for the first 6 \nmonths of project implementation, whichever is lower.  \n \nIDCOL as the implementing agency will be responsible for preparing \ndisbursement  projections,  collecting  supporting  documents, \npreparing  withdrawal  applications  and  sending  them  to  ADB  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and such other arrangements as may \nbe agreed between ADB and IDCOL. For disbursement amounts of \nless  than  $100,000,  IDCOL  can  follow  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  To enhance the sustainability of the PPIDF, ADB will provide TA of \n$500,000  for  1.5  years.  The  main  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to \n(i) assist line ministries in the drafting of proper PPP frameworks in \nBangladesh  based  on  IDCOL\u2019s  experience  in  financing  private \nsector-led  infrastructure  projects  when  requested  by  those  line \nministries;  (ii)  provide  the  Government  and  its  agencies  with \nfeedback about bottlenecks, issues, and concerns from the market \nand from private sector sponsors, and offer advice and solutions; (iii) \nconduct sector and industry studies; (iv) support the development of \nadditional capacity within IDCOL to appraise subprojects, manage \nits expanding subproject portfolio, and supervise the implementation \nof  its  renewable  energy  program;  (v)  provide  training  to  staff  in \nrelevant  government  agencies  in  credit  and  risk  assessment, \nmanagement, and mitigation; and (vi) provide training to IDCOL in \nthe environmental and social assessment of subprojects. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  reduction  by \nBeneficiaries  increasing  farm  and  nonfarm  productivity.  Empirical  evidence \nindicates a correlation between growth in provincial gross domestic \nproduct  and  poverty  reduction.  Investment  in  infrastructure  as  a \nwhole and on roads and transportation in particular has a direct \ncontribution to this reduction by (i) reducing transaction costs; (ii) \nenabling  economic  agents  such  as  individuals,  firms,  and \ngovernments to respond efficiently to demand; (iii) lowering costs of \ninputs; (iv) opening up opportunities for entrepreneurs; (v) creating \nemployment especially in public works both as social protection and \nas a countercyclical policy in times of recession; and (vi) enhancing \nhuman capital by improving access to health and education. \n ", "vii \n   \nRisks and  Effective Demand. A strong pipeline of private sector-sponsored \nAssumptions  infrastructure subprojects that could be eligible for IDCOL financing \nhas been identified. The estimated volume of the expected funding \nfor those subprojects is more than enough to absorb the proposed \nADB loans to IDCOL. A significant number of these subprojects are \npriority investments designed to address crippling energy shortfalls, \nand  ADB  support  through  the  PPIDF  is  perceived  as  critical  to \novercoming financing constraints and facilitating implementation. \n   \n  Institutional  Capacity.  While  IDCOL\u2019s  staff  strength  of  36  is \ncommensurate to the current level of operations, it might not be able \nto  cope  with  additional  and  more  complex  activities,  especially \nrelating  to  large  infrastructure  subprojects.  IDCOL  currently \noutsources most of these activities. To address this concern, IDCOL \nhas started to strengthen its subproject assessment capabilities and \ncapacity  and  has  initiated  its  own  marketing  program  to  source \npotential  business  opportunities.  These  activities  will  be  further \nsupported by the ADB TA. To improve its skill and capacity, IDCOL \nwill  also  enter  into  strategic  partnerships  with  international \norganizations  involved  in  infrastructure  investments,  advisory \nservices, and development of renewable energy. \n \nChange in Government Policies. The current emphasis on private \nparticipation to boost infrastructure development and promotion of \nrenewable energy may change. A change in government might lead \nto  the  implementation  of  more  restrictive  laws  and  policies \nconcerning  infrastructure  project  financing,  foreign  investment, \ncurrency exchange, and other matters, thereby affecting the ability of \nIDCOL  to  fund  infrastructure  subprojects.  The  risk  of  adverse \npolicies  being  introduced  is  considered  minimal  since  the \nGovernment is keen on pursuing infrastructure sector development \nthrough  private  sector  participation.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  will  facilitate  adoption  of \nprogressive sector polices. \n \nGovernance.  Good  governance  is  an  essential  precondition  for \nsustainable development in Bangladesh\u2019s infrastructure sectors. The \nGovernment has put good governance at the center of infrastructure \nsector reform policies. Various measures have been included in the \nProject\u2019s design to promote good governance and mitigate the risk \nof  corruption  by  enhancing  predictability,  transparency,  and \naccountability  in  doing  business.  These  measures  include \nprofessional  management  of  IDCOL  and  continued \ncommercialization and financial strengthening of IDCOL. In addition, \nIDCOL\u2019s organizational structure and business processes have been \nthoroughly assessed to determine vulnerability to corruption. A risk \nassessment  has  been  undertaken  and  the  Project  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  legal  arrangements  include \nappropriate risk mitigation measures. \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development \nFacility (PPIDF). The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity \nDevelopment for the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA.

Over  the  last  4  years  (FY2004\u2013FY2007)  Bangladesh  has  witnessed  remarkable \neconomic growth, with an average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.3% per \nannum and an annual GDP growth rate of 6.2% in FY2008. This performance, coupled with an \nimpressive decline in the population growth rate from 2.5% in the 1980s to 1.7% in 1990\u20132004, \nhas led to a doubling of annual per capita GDP growth, from 1.6% in the 1980s to 3.3% in \n1990\u20132004. However, to keep the positive momentum going, and to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals income poverty targets, Bangladesh needs to accelerate its medium-term \neconomic growth rate to at least 7%\u20138% per annum.1  \n \n3.  While macroeconomic management\u2014measured by fiscal deficit, inflation, and foreign \nexchange reserves\u2014has seen moderate success, public investments in infrastructure have \nremained stagnant at only 6%\u20137% of GDP. Of the 131 developing and industrialized countries \nranked by the Global Competitiveness Report 2007\u20132008,2 Bangladesh ranked 120th for quality \nof infrastructure, which was lower than most other developing countries in South Asia with the \nexception of Nepal.3 Lack of public investment in infrastructure could not be covered through \nforeign direct investments (FDI). Political uncertainty, poor infrastructure, and a weak business \nenvironment have deterred investments. The inward FDI potential and performance indices of \nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development indicate FDI inflows of only $625 \nmillion in 2006 (10% less than in 2005).  \n \n4.  Infrastructure obstacles are a major problem for the economy of Bangladesh.4 Many \nyears of underinvestment have taken a toll and resulted in poor access to basic infrastructure \nfor a large part of Bangladesh's population, particularly the economically disadvantaged and \nthose in rural areas. Although 60% of urban households have an electricity connection, only \n22% of rural households do.5 Sixty nine percent of enterprises in rural areas report no access to \nelectricity at all. Of those which have access to electricity, frequent power outages and surges \npose significant costs to enterprises, with only 1.8% of the roughly 3 million rural enterprises \nowning  a  generator.  Poor  road  conditions  and  lack  of  transportation  and  means  of \ncommunication (only 1.5% reported to have access to a fixed-line telephone service) add to the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

", "2 \ncosts for Bangladesh\u2019s economy and leave the potential for growth in rural areas unfulfilled. \nAccess to hygienic sanitation and safe water is alarmingly inadequate. In addition, Bangladesh \ncannot reach its full potential to be a transport6 and transshipment hub, and this limits the \ncountry\u2019s  opportunities  for  economic  integration  with  its  neighbors.  An  assessment  of  key \ninfrastructure sectors can be found in Appendix 2.  \n \n5.  Historic  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  (with  the  infrastructure  stock  per  capita \ngrowing at only 1.2% annually) means that huge investments in power, gas, ports, roads, \nrailways, and water supply and sanitation are required. Investments required by 2015 for new \npower generation and transmission are estimated at $6.4 billion; nearly $7.7 billion will be \nrequired for exploring and developing additional gas reserves during the same period, and \nsignificant investments are envisaged for the development of the coal sector. About half of these \nestimated  investments  are  expected  from  the  private  sector  and  the  balance  from  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh (the Government) and development partners.  \n \n6.  The  private  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  already  made  important  and  innovative \ncontributions  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  services,  particularly  in  telecommunications, \npower, water, and sanitation. In telecommunications, the six private companies currently reach \nabout  29  million  subscribers,  compared  to  1.3  million  by  the  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and \nTelephone Board. In the water and sanitation sector, contributions include privately financed \nhand pump programs, water vending in Dhaka, efforts by nongovernment organizations (NGO) \nto extend formal water services to urban slum areas, and the provision of credit by microfinance \ninstitutions for the development of water systems in rural and semiurban areas. In the power \nsector,  independent  power  producers  presently  produce  about  38%  of  the  total  national \ngeneration.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  As it is the case in most of South Asia, the public sector has been the main provider of \nbasic infrastructure in Bangladesh. However, public financing alone will not be able to generate \nthe investments needed to provide the required level of infrastructure facilities.7 At present, most \npublic  service  providers  show  weak  financial  performance  and  inadequate  investment.  To \nenhance the role of the private sector in the provision of infrastructure services, the Government \nis (i) revising policies and regulations across sectors for enhancing private sector participation in \ninfrastructure development including through public\u2013private partnership (PPP),8 (ii) enabling \narrangements for bridging the enormous deficit in infrastructure financing especially for long-\nterm funds through all possible sources, and (iii) strengthening the capacity at all levels. While \nthe Government has pursued reforms for establishing a framework conducive to infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  broadening  the  range  of  financing  modalities,  significant  scaling  up  of \ninfrastructure  development  still  faces  formidable  challenges  in  the  adaptation  and \nimplementation of those reforms.  \n \n                                                 \n6  As a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, the average cost of exports is estimated to be 80% higher and for \nimports 35% higher than for most countries in South Asia. \n7  The Government\u2019s underinvestment in infrastructure is largely attributable to the very low level of government \nrevenue collection (currently less than 11% GDP compared with a South Asian average of 19%).  \n8  PPP projects are typically projects developed, implemented, and operated by bidders (stand-alone special purpose \nvehicles). Further, these projects have been selected on the basis of a competitive and transparent bidding \narrangement and are expected to be build-and-operate infrastructure based on a concession with the Government.  \n ", "3 \n1.   Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines  \n \n8.  To  enhance  private  infrastructure  development,  the  Government  issued  the  Private \nSector Infrastructure Guidelines (PSIG)9 in October 2004. The guidelines formally acknowledge \nthe positive impacts of the private sector in telecommunications, gas, and power, and seek to \ntranslate this success to other sectors. Further, the PSIG identifies that the lack of guidelines \nand operating procedures in sourcing and developing potential infrastructure projects impedes \nprivate sector participation. Accordingly, the PSIG provide for a national high-profile private \ninfrastructure committee (PICOM) under the prime minister\u2019s office to facilitate and promote \nprivate  infrastructure  projects,  while  the  Board  of  Investment  acts as  PICOM\u2019s  secretariat. \nInfrastructure  projects  initiated  by  private  sponsors  or  line  ministries  require  Government \napproval  to  be  listed  as  a  private  infrastructure  project.  Based  on  PICOM\u2019s  analysis  and \nrecommendation, the cabinet committee on economic affairs approves the project, following \nwhich PICOM oversees its implementation by the executing agency. PICOM does not have any \napproval authority but facilitates and monitors private infrastructure projects.  \n \n9.  While the PSIG provide broad guidelines for PPPs and lay down the basic principles, \nthey lack the details usually found in a national PPP framework. While earnest efforts have been \nmade to upgrade the existing PPP guidelines, no detailed PPP framework has emerged so far. \nSome infrastructure sectors\u2014in particular those that have been very successful in integrating \nthe private sector in their development like gas, power, and telecommunications\u2014have set up \nsector-specific private sector policies.  \n \n2.  Key Infrastructure Sector Reforms \n \n10.  To catalyze infrastructure development, the  Government is (i) developing legal and \nregulatory frameworks and contractual arrangements, (ii) enhancing planning and coordination, \nand (iii) ensuring quality of infrastructure. To pursue these, policy actions and reforms (Table 1) \nhave been taken across sectors to reduce risks and to strengthen the enabling environment. \n \nTable 1: Policies and Reforms in Infrastructure Sectors \n \nSector  Policies and Reforms \nGeneral  National  Land  Transport  Policy,  2004,  to  encourage  greater  private  sector \nTransport  participation. \nA private sector participation policy for the shipping sector is being considered.  \nRoads  Road master plan, which emphasizes the importance of private sector involvement, \nbeing considered for approval.  \nMost of the potential private sector projects under the road master plan are planned on \na build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis with concession periods of 25\u201330 years. \nInland  In 2005, the Government declared 13 land custom stations as land ports to be bid out \nWater  under build\u2013operate\u2013transfer arrangements to the private sector. \nTransport \nIn March 2007, the Chittagong Container Terminal was handed over to a private \noperator, which has resulted in a 30% cost reduction so far. \n                                                 \n9  Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2004.

Notwithstanding the progress, these reforms can be characterized, at best, as work in \nprogress. Development partners are unanimous that sustained and significant improvements in \nthe enabling environment are necessary, and this will require development partners to work \nclosely with the Government in pursuing these reforms. Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \nalready supporting the reforms through a number of interventions (paras. 26\u201327). \n \n3.  Governance Challenges \n \n12.  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy  is  widely  regarded  as  suffering  from  issues  related  to \ngovernance. Despite progress in many social indicators, perceived widespread corruption adds \nto the costs of doing business and reduces the nation\u2019s competitiveness and attractiveness for \nFDIs. Significant  governance challenges  in Bangladesh occur at  three levels\u2014national, sector, \nand corporate. Through the good governance program,10 ADB is (i) strengthening the ongoing \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2007.

Public  procurement  procedures  that  are  universally  associated  with  high  levels  of \ncorruption are being addressed by ADB, the World Bank, and other development partners. The \nParliament  passed  the  Public  Procurement  Act  in  2006.  The  Government  has  recently \ndemonstrated  strong  commitment  to  pursuing  critical  governance  reforms  with  focus  on \ncombating  corruption,  ensuring  the  effectiveness  and  independence  of  the  judiciary,  and \ndepoliticizing the civil service. It has already reconstituted the Anticorruption Commission with \nnew commissioners, framed new laws to tackle corruption, taken tough legal and prosecutorial \nactions, and ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.  \n \n4.  Infrastructure Financing  \n \n14.  The  inability  to  mobilize  debt  for  infrastructure  projects  is  a  key  impediment  to \ninfrastructure financing. As debt accounts for nearly 75% of a typical financing package, its \navailability in terms of volume and maturities necessary for large-scale infrastructure projects is \na  binding  constraint  in  many  developing  countries,  and  particularly  in  Bangladesh,  where \nconstraints to long-term debt mobilization are compounded by the nation's lack of credit rating.11 \nFurthermore, with a balance of payments problem, Bangladesh cannot rely exclusively on \nforeign capital to finance its infrastructure. International commercial banks have exposure limits \nto countries and sectors, and find it difficult to lend at maturity terms suitable for infrastructure \nprojects (12\u201315 years or more) given the market and political risks in Bangladesh. With an \nunderdeveloped financial sector, Bangladesh is likely to face severe constraints in securing \nlong-term foreign and domestic funding for private sector infrastructure projects.  \n \na.  Underdeveloped Capital Market  \n \n15.  Bangladesh\u2019s capital market\u2014the market for trading long-term debt and equity securities, \nconsisting of primary and secondary markets\u2014remains underdeveloped. So far, the volume of \nfunding sourced from the local debt and equity market for private investment expenditure in \nBangladesh has been quite small. The absence of an active long-term corporate debt market in \nBangladesh adds to the dearth of financing for infrastructure from domestic sources. Private \nsector sponsors still rely more on banks and internal resources than on market borrowings, \nindicating weakness in debt markets. Commercial banks also prefer loans to investing in bonds \nas there is no mark-to-market12 requirement for loans, whereas bonds are subject to the mark-\nto-market rule and as a result require provisioning for downward adjustment in valuation. In \nresponse to these, commercial banks charge floating rates for infrastructure loans as a matter of \ngeneral  practice.  This  effectively  makes  a  loan  a  short-duration  instrument.  The  pivotal \nimpediment to the development of a debt market lies in the extraordinarily high-yield structure \n                                                 \n11 At present, Bangladesh does not have a sovereign rating issued by any international rating agency. \n12 Mark-to-market is the assigning of a value to a position held in a financial instrument based on the current market \nprice for that instrument. \n ", "6 \non  savings  schemes  such  as  the  national  savings  certificates.13 This  artificially  high-yield \npremium of savings schemes tends to drive up the cost of bank deposits and deter the issuance \nof market-priced private sector debt instruments.  \n \nb.  Limited Providers of Long-Term Debt  \n \n16.  Commercial banks in Bangladesh are facing maturity mismatches in their asset and \nliability management as they rely on short-term deposits as their financial source, and this \nprevents them from providing long-term financing for infrastructure projects. Therefore, most \ncommercial  banks  focus  on  short-dated  lending  activities,  in  particular,  to  the  emerging \nconsumer finance sector. Also, loan officers of banks are typically not trained in assessing long-\nterm stability of cash flows from a project finance perspective as they lack the technical ability to \nanalyze and structure project finance transactions. \n \n17.  Other potential sources of debt, such as institutional investors like provident funds or \ninsurance  companies,  are  potentially  an  important  source  of  demand  for  long-term  debt. \nHowever, this investor class has limited market penetration in Bangladesh and is typically \naverse  to  undertaking  equity-like  risks  often  associated  with  long-term  infrastructure  debt \nfinancing in developing countries. Furthermore, if commercial lenders include the necessary risk \npremium  to  compensate  fully  for  the  perceived  risks  of  the  transaction,  sponsors  and/or \ngovernments will often deem the price prohibitive. \n \nc.  Reforms  \n \n18.  The ongoing financial sector reforms focus on (i) greater autonomy for the Bangladesh \nBank (the central bank), (ii) strengthening Bangladesh Bank's capabilities and technical skills to \nperform its enhanced responsibilities, (iii) strengthening prudential regulations and supervision, \n(iv) restructuring the management and internal processes of state-owned commercial banks and \nultimately privatization, (v) strengthening the legal and judicial processes, and (vi) improving the \nmoney  and  debt  markets.  These  reforms  have  been  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and ADB. \n \n19.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Financial  Institutions  Development  Project14 has  enhanced  the \ngovernment debt market from a market with limited maturities and literally no secondary trading \nto an active market with regular auctions for debt with maturities up to 10 years. In addition, \nsimplification  of  market  regulations  to  facilitate  bond  and  security  issues  and  rules  and \nprocedures for bonds and debentures were also developed and implemented. The World Bank \nis also strengthening the capacity of the Bangladesh Bank15 and is reforming some nationalized \ncommercial  banks,  leading  to  their  privatization,  under  the  Enterprise  Growth  and  Bank \nModernization Project16 and Second Development Support Credit Project.17 The progress on \n                                                 \n13  National savings certificates are issued by the Government as part of its borrowing program targeted at retail \ninvestors. No interest is paid over the tenor of these instruments, which is typically 5 years. On redemption, all the \nproceeds are free of tax. The interest rate is currently approximately 10.6%. \n14 World Bank. 1999. Financial Institutions Development Project. Washington, DC. \n15 World  Bank.  2003.

The ADB-financed Capital Market Development Program18 helped enhance the market \ncapacity and develop a fair, transparent, and efficient domestic capital market in order to attract \ninvestment capital for augmenting the capital resources of the banking system and improve \nefficiency in allocating resources. More recently, an ADB TA loan19 is supporting governance \nand capacity building of the capital market as well as the insurance sector. \n \n21.  While  significant  reforms  and  reform  initiatives  are  under  way,  several  regulatory \nchallenges in infrastructure sectors persist, policy, institutional, and market gaps remain. The \nimpact of the ongoing reforms in the financial sectors will only be realized during the medium- to \nlong-term, and, as a result, the already significant gap in infrastructure financing will further \nincrease.  Addressing  the  prevailing  market  inadequacies  and  at  the  same  time  keep  the \ninfrastructure development agenda moving forward are important for Bangladesh.  \n \nC.  Description of the Infrastructure Development Company Limited \n \n22.  Development partners recognize the role of infrastructure in inclusive development and \npoverty reduction in Bangladesh. Insufficient capacity across infrastructure sectors is widening \ninfrastructure gaps, resulting in lower productivity, higher transport and logistics costs, and \nreduced competitiveness. Considering these, and specifically in the context of the magnitude of \ninfrastructure investments required and the very limited supply of long-term resources, there is a \nneed to catalyze increasing amounts of financing for bankable infrastructure projects that have \nemerged even when the reforms are evolving. There is a sufficient number of infrastructure \nprojects in Bangladesh that need access to long-term financing for implementation. Enabling the \nfinancing of such projects by a consortium of investors and lenders will facilitate the deepening \nof  project  development  and  financing  skills  in  the  country  and  enhance  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development. This is an essential element of the overall reforms \nfor infrastructure development. \n \n23.  IDCOL is the only financial institution in Bangladesh that can catalyze international long-\nterm  foreign  currency  funding  and  international  know-how  for  infrastructure  finance. \nIncorporated on 14 May 1997 as a 100% government-owned public limited company under the \nCompanies Act, 1994, IDCOL was set up with World Bank assistance under the Private Sector \nInfrastructure Development Project (PSIDP).20 IDCOL\u2019s initial function was to administer the \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Development Fund set up under the PSIDP initiative and to onlend \nfunds  to  eligible  privately  sponsored  infrastructure  projects.

Although IDCOL can operate in \nmany sectors, it has confined its activities to the infrastructure sectors in order to serve a niche \nmarket.  Its  product  range  is  the  financing  of  small,  medium,  and  large  infrastructure  and \nrenewable  energy  projects  using  funds  from  reflows  of  loans  made  under  various  donor-\nsupported programs, and its own equity resources.

As  of  September  2007,  the  World  Bank's  portfolio  in  the  infrastructure  sector  of \nBangladesh  (including  the  International  Development  Association)  consisted  of  13  projects \namounting to $1.1 billion.23 In June 2006 the World Bank established a $60 million (of which $10 \nmillion  is  from  the  Government)  Investment  Promotion  and  Financing  Facility  (IPFF)24 at \nBangladesh  Bank  for  part  financing25 of  government-approved  private  sector  infrastructure \nprojects especially in the power sector.26  \n \n29.  Japan  and  Germany  are  the  other  development  partners  with  major  infrastructure \ninterventions in Bangladesh. As of June 2006, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation had \ncommitted eight projects for a total of \u00a559,275 million ($531.92 million) mainly in power, water, \ntelecommunications, and construction subsectors.27 Germany has made financial commitments \nto  Bangladesh  amounting  to  \u20ac55.2  million  ($78.8  million).  Currently,  German  development \ncooperation  through  KfW  has  three  infrastructure  projects  in  its  portfolio  including  (i)  a \ntransmission line which is cofinanced with ADB, (ii) rural markets and roads, and (iii) promotion \nof renewable energy.28 The third of these (renewable energy) is currently being successfully \nimplemented by IDCOL. A summary of the external assistance to the infrastructure sector in \nBangladesh is provided in Appendix 5. \n \nE.  Lessons  \n30.

IDCOL is not a DFI but rather a long-term financier with the objective of operating on \nfully commercial terms independently of the Government, and for catalyzing private sector funds \nto the infrastructure sector. Given the small size and the underdeveloped nature of the financial \nmarkets in Bangladesh, development partners consider IDCOL as an appropriate intermediary, \nwhich focuses exclusively on infrastructure and is the only provider of long-term financing in the \ncountry. ADB carried out thorough due diligence to appraise the financial strength and credit-\nassessment capacity of IDCOL and found both satisfactory. In addition, a detailed review was \nconducted  on  corporate  governance  in  Bangladesh  and  the  structure  in  place  at  IDCOL. \nIDCOL\u2019s pipeline of transactions ready for financing is considered to be robust and extensive.  \n \n32.  In addition to lessons learned from the ADB evaluation, World Bank\u2019s experience with \nIDCOL was also analyzed. World Bank approved in 1997 a loan and a TA of $225 million to the \nGovernment  for  the  PSIDP  in  support  of  IDCOL,  the  Infrastructure  Investment  Facilitation \nCenter,  and  other  implementing  agencies.  The  objective  was  to  assist  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment in Bangladesh by promoting private sector participation. Under the project, IDCOL \nwas established to assume the role of the fund manager on behalf of the Government. The \nInfrastructure Investment Facilitation Center was formed two years later to assist IDCOL in \nidentifying, structuring, promoting, and procuring for suitable projects. Under the PSIDP, only \napproximately $80 million was disbursed. The project was closed in 2002 and was rated in the \nrecently published implementation completion and results report30 as moderately unsatisfactory. \nThe key lesson drawn from the PSIDP is to allow flexibility in selection and financing of projects. \nThe PSIDP was designed for majority private-owned greenfield projects. As a result, it excluded \njoint ventures, concessions, management contracts, PPPs, capacity extension, redevelopment, \nand social sector projects. The PSIDP also did not allow local currency transactions, which \ndisadvantaged local sponsors.  \n \nF.   Policy Dialogue and Development Partner Coordination \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s extensive support for infrastructure development is underpinned with sustained \npolicy dialogue in coordination with development partners. In the transport sector, the ongoing \npolicy dialogue aims to improve the capacity, governance, and accountability of Bangladesh \nRailway and to overcome capacity constraints for providing improved access to markets and \nservices. Ongoing ADB TAs are facilitating further private sector investments and PPPs in the \npower sector31 and to help ensure transparency and fairness in the tendering process.32 In the \ngas sector, ADB has helped explore private sector participation,33 and has also processed a \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2005.

In \naddition, preparatory work is ongoing for a proposed gas sector development program.35 Policy \ndialogue  in  collaboration  with  development  partners  and  emphasis  on  private  sector \nparticipation are being pursued for expediting reforms and catalyzing resources. \n \n34.  For improving overall governance in the various infrastructure sectors, ADB support at \nthe sector level has incorporated components that focus on good governance. This has meant \nthat good governance is being brought into the mainstream in the sectors, which is also one of \nthe  key  goals  of  the  good  governance  program  (footnote  10).  Some  sector  projects  and \nprograms where this has been evident include, for example, the sustainable power sector \ndevelopment program,36 the railway sector investment program,37 and the Chittagong port trade \nfacilitation  project. 38  Furthermore,  ADB  interventions  in  the  financial  sector  are  being \ncoordinated with the other development partners (paras. 28\u201329).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n35.  The PPIDF will directly support the Government\u2019s infrastructure development agenda \nthrough  enhancing  the  availability  of  the  much  needed  long-term  funds  for  infrastructure \nfinancing.  With  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  the  PPIDF  will  provide  funds  at  commercial  terms  for \nmaturities  currently  not  being  provided  by  the  market.  The  PPIDF  complements  ongoing \nfinancial sector reforms, PPPs, and infrastructure projects, all of which aim to create an enabling \nenvironment for long-term financing for the infrastructure sector. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n36.  The impact of the PPIDF will be an improved infrastructure sector in Bangladesh through \nincreased  private  sector  participation,  thereby  promoting  economic  growth  and  reducing \npoverty. Private participation offers significant potential to speed up the pace of infrastructure \ndevelopment, expand access, and deliver efficient services. The design of the PPIDF serves to \nattract commercial financing, thereby reducing the pressure on the public budget. Private sector \nparticipation  will  also  introduce  new  technologies  and  help  increase  the  efficiency  of  the \ninfrastructure sector by ensuring commercial orientation and discipline a the subproject level. \nThe PPIDF\u2019s outcome is to help address the infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh through \nproviding  long-term  debt  financing  and  catalyzing  private  sector  participation.  With  ADB\u2019s \nassistance through the Project, IDCOL will be able to provide foreign exchange and local \ncurrency  funds  for  infrastructure  subprojects  at  commercial  terms  with  a  20-year  maturity \ncurrently not available in the domestic capital markets.  \n \n                                                 \n34 ADB. 2005.

The PPIDF is divided into three main components having different \ntarget groups and objectives. Component A will use ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) \nfunds to provide dollar financing to the Government for relending to IDCOL to finance large \nprivate  sector-sponsored  infrastructure  subprojects.  Component  B  will  provide  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) funding to the Government for relending in local currency to IDCOL to \nfinance small and medium-sized infrastructure subprojects (SMIP) primarily located in rural and \nsemiurban areas, especially in the energy sector. Component C will provide ADF funding for \ncontinuing IDCOL\u2019s successful renewable energy program. The Project design is explained in \nAppendix 6. Further details on the three Project components follow. \n \n38.  It is estimated that the $165 million facility will help catalyze investments of about $600 \nmillion from the private sector to finance approximately 15\u201320 PPP subprojects,39 which will add \nat least 900 megawatts (MW) of power generation capacity in the private sector and provide \nelectricity to approximately 100,000 additional households through IDCOL's renewable energy \nprograms.  The  main  targets  and  indicators  are  (i) the  number  of  high-quality  and  viable \ninfrastructure assets sponsored by international and local firms, and (ii) the financing of roughly \n100,000 SHSs, 15 biomass installations, and 100 biogas power plants covering all regions of \nBangladesh.  PPIDF  also  seeks  to  develop  capacity  of  IDCOL,  among  others,  for    project \nappraisal  portfolio management, and environment and social safeguards due diligence.  \n \n1.  Component A: Financing of Private Sector-Sponsored Large Infrastructure \nSubprojects  \n \n39.  The proposed OCR loan of $82 million will be used to finance large-scale private sector-\nsponsored infrastructure subprojects with a total size of each subproject more than $30 million \nand should be an integral part of the Government's priority plan for the relevant sector. Paras. \n70 and 71 provide further details on the selection criteria for sub-borrower and subprojects \neligible for IDCOL financing under component A.  \n \n40.  The eligible subsectors, which meet the Government\u2019s current priority plan, include \n(i) power generation, which\u2014given the acute power shortage in the country\u2014is expected to \nreceive priority in terms of financing under this component of the PPIDF; (ii) roads and bridges; \n(iii) railways; (iv) ports (including seaports and airports); (v) gas and gas-related infrastructure; \n(vi)  water  supply,  sewage,  and  solid-waste  management;  (vii)  information  technology; \n(viii) renewable  energy;  and  (ix)  other  infrastructure  development  subprojects  as  may  be \napproved by the Government, ADB, and IDCOL\u2019s board. \n \n41.  This component will enable IDCOL to provide dollar funding to cover up to 40% of the \ncosts of an individual subproject while the subproject sponsor will be required to invest a \nminimum of 20% of the total subproject cost as equity, thereby better balancing the risk factors \nbetween the subproject sponsor and the Government via IDCOL. The remaining debt financing \nwill be sourced from private sector financiers.  \n \n                                                 \n39 IDCOL will finance subprojects only as a member of consortium where its total lending to any subproject does not \nexceed 40% of the total capital cost for the subproject. \n ", "13 \n42.  The goal will be for IDCOL to play a catalytic role in attracting other commercial funding \nsources in order to fill the financing gap, as commercial banks and the domestic capital market \ncannot provide enough long-term project financing. Since these large infrastructure subprojects \nare normally financed in dollars with the help of a consortium of international banks, there is no \nneed for the Government (or IDCOL) to swap the dollar proceeds from the OCR loan into any \nother currency. \n \n2.  Component B: Small and Medium-Sized Infrastructure Subprojects \n \n43.  Up to $50 million equivalent of the ADF loan will be provided to IDCOL for the purpose of \nfinancing  SMIPs,  primarily  in  the  energy  sector  in  rural  and  semiurban  areas  and  other \ninfrastructure sectors. Subprojects should require local currency financing, be financially viable \non their own with robust and predictable cash flows, and meet the Government, ADB, and \nIDCOL environmental and social assessment requirements. \n \n44.  IDCOL\u2019s total exposure to an individual SMIP will not exceed $10 million. Sponsors of \neligible SMIPs should preferably be from Bangladesh or have significant operations in the \ncountry and have a proven track record of successfully developing, financing, and operating \nsimilar  infrastructure  subprojects.  Apart  from  the  above  specific  requirements,  the  same \nselection criteria apply to component A as well as component B (paras. 70 and 71). \n \n45.  This component will enable IDCOL to provide financial support in taka for SMIPs which \nare being developed by local companies and sponsors. IDCOL will provide long-term funding \ndenominated in local currency to those subprojects that typically earn revenues in taka and \ncannot absorb foreign exchange rate risks without unduly endangering their operating gross \nmargin or debt service coverage ratios.  \n \n46.  Debt finance for developers and sponsors of SMIPs is constrained in part because of the \ngenerally  limited  level  of  development  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  financial  sector  and  therefore \nunavailability  of  long-term  local  currency  funding.  It  is  also  constrained  because  lenders \nperceive the risks associated with these activities as too high. This component will therefore \naddress both the risk perception and credit availability.  \n \n3.  Component C: Renewable Energy Subloans  \n \n47.  The balance of the ADF loan, amounting to $33 million equivalent, will be used by \nIDCOL  for  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy  systems  (RES)  in  Bangladesh.  IDCOL  will \nfinance the set up of RESs such as SHSs and/or biomass installations through a microfinance-\nbased, direct sales program.  \n \n48.  In particular, IDCOL will use the proceeds of the ADF loan to (i) provide loans to \nparticipating organizations to refinance up to 80% of the loans that rural households receive for \nthe purchase of SHSs, (ii) provide loans to companies for biomass installations in rural or \nsemiurban areas, and (iii) finance commercial or semicommercial biogas plants or biogas-based \nelectricity plants. The objective of this component is to promote the use of environmentally \nfriendly  RESs  in  rural  areas  and  support  initiatives  in  rural  areas  through  participating \norganizations for the productive use of electricity to increase household income. \n \n49.  IDCOL has been very successful in the recent past in undertaking renewable energy \nsubprojects. The company had an initial target of financing 50,000 SHSs, which it achieved in \nAugust 2005, 3 years ahead of the target date and $2 million below estimated costs. Following \n ", "14 \nthe success of IDCOL\u2019s solar program, the World Bank extended its support for financing \nrenewable energy subprojects and German development cooperation through KfW provided \n\u20ac16.5 million ($21.3 million) in 2005 as a grant to the Government to be used for the further \nfinancing of renewable energy subprojects. As of April 2008, 200,000 SHSs with a capacity of \n11 MW providing electricity to more than 1 million people have been installed under IDCOL\u2019s \nsolar energy program.  \n \n50.  IDCOL has now set an ambitious target to extend the program by installing more than \n1 million  SHSs  by  2012.  The  implementation  will  be  undertaken  through  15  qualified \nparticipating organizations (Appendix 7 provides the eligibility criteria), which are primarily NGOs \nand  microfinance  institutions,  to  take  advantage  of  their  grassroots  networks.  Participating \norganizations select subproject areas and potential customers, extend loans, install the systems, \nmonitor their performance, and provide maintenance support. IDCOL will provide grants and \nrefinancing, set technical specifications for solar equipment, develop publicity materials, provide \ntraining, and monitor the performance of participating organizations. IDCOL currently offers local \ncurrency loans with a 10-year maturity and a 2-year grace period at 6% per annum interest to \nthe participating organizations. The households will buy SHSs either for cash or on credit. \nParticipating organizations then extend microcredit loans of up to 80% of the price of the SHS40 \nto the households purchasing these systems. The loan tenor varies from 1 to 5 years, and \ninterest rate varies from 8% to 15% per annum. In all instances, the periodic repayment is on a \nmonthly basis. \n  \n51.  The  credit  program  will  also  be  open  to  support  wind  energy,  small  hydropower \nsubprojects and biomass installations, commercial and semicommercial biogas plants, biogas-\nbased electricity plants, and other renewable energy subprojects developed by the private \nsector, NGOs, and communities. Appendix 8 provides a more detailed overview of IDCOL\u2019s \nrenewable energy program. Subject to availability, the use of grant funds (for instance, through \nthe application of funds from the Climate Change Fund and the recently established Clean \nEnergy  Financing  Partnership  Facility)41 to  complement  the  above  activities  will  also  be \nconsidered. \n \nC.   Infrastructure Development Company Limited\u2019s Subproject Pipeline \n \n52.  The firmness of IDCOL\u2019s subproject pipeline varies by sector. The pipeline is well-\nadvanced  in  electricity  generation,  but  is  less-well  developed  in  other  sectors  such  as \ntransportation and water. Supplementary Appendixes D and E provide a detailed overview and \ndescription of IDCOL\u2019s pipeline transactions. \n \n53.  IDCOL\u2019s pipeline requiring taka financing for 2008\u20132011 includes 20 small- to medium-\nscale power subprojects up to 80 MW, including two captive power plants. Fifteen of them have \nalready signed the project agreements, including the power purchase agreement with either the \nMinistry of Energy or, for the captive power plants, with their respective entities. In those cases \n                                                 \n40 A typical SHS installation with a capacity of 50 watts costs approximately $400. IDCOL currently offers a \nnonrefundable subsidy of $50 (\u20ac30) to lower the price of an SHS and increase the affordability of the system. \n41 In April 2007, ADB established the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, funded by multiple development \npartners, to provide the additional financial resources and technical support for components of investment projects \nto improve energy security in ADB\u2019s developing member countries and decrease the rate of climate change \nthrough increased use of clean energy. \n ", "15 \nthe equity\u2013debt portion has been fixed. For six of the power plants, the lead arranger42 has been \nappointed and IDCOL has received an information memorandum. These six subprojects are \nsupported by the same two sponsors and all use proven technology. \n \n54.  From 2009\u20132011, three new very large subprojects in the energy sector will come to the \nmarket, which will require foreign currency financing from IDCOL. These are the 450 MW \nBibiana Power Plant at Hobigonj,43 the 450 MW Sirajganj clean-fuel combined cycle power \nplant,  and  the  450  MW  Meghnaghat  Phase  3  combined  cycle  power  plant.44 All  three \nsubprojects are build-own-operate projects to be financed and built by private sector sponsors \nfor  commissioning  by  2010  and  require  large  amounts  of  dollar  long-term  financing  ($400 \nmillion\u2013$600 million for each subproject). The ADB OCR loan to IDCOL is expected to be \nprimarily utilized for the partial financing of some of these interventions. \n \n55.  IDCOL is also targeting the financing of approximately 89,000 SHSs under its existing \nrenewable energy program until the end of 2008 for a total subproject cost of Tk2.73 billion \n($39.9 million), of which IDCOL\u2019s share is roughly 67%. Given the fast pace of IDCOL\u2019s solar \nenergy program, which currently finances the installation of 12,000 SHSs per month, it is \nexpected that the KfW funds will be fully utilized by the end of 2008 at the latest\u20142 years ahead \nof schedule. IDCOL then intends to use the ADF loan of $33 million to provide refinancing \nfacilities  to  its  participating  organizations  to  finance  a  further  98,000  SHSs,  15  biomass \ngasification-based power plants, and 100 biogas-based power plants. Until 2011, IDCOL plans \nto finance the installation of additional 396,000 SHSs for Tk11.88 billion ($173.7 million) and the \nconstruction  of  15  biomass  gasification-based  power  plants  and  200  biogas-based  power \nplants. \n \nD.  Financing Arrangements \n \n56.  The  Government  has  requested  an  $82  million  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  to  assist  in \nfinancing the Project. The OCR loan will have a 25-year maturity, including a 5-year grace \nperiod, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the relevant loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n57.  The loan proceeds will be relent to IDCOL in dollars at a relending LIBOR rate plus 100 \nbasis  points  per  annum  and  for  a  20-year  term45 for  the  purpose  of  foreign  currency \ndisbursements pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement with such other terms and conditions \nacceptable to ADB. Onlending by IDCOL to eligible subprojects will be at interest rates that \n                                                 \n42 In four cases, the lead arranger is the Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center, the World Bank-financed \nfacility, and the Standard Chartered Bank (for two captive power plants).  \n43 Prequalification bidding for the project has been completed. Four consortiums have been prequalified to participate \nin the second round of bidding. The whole process is expected to be completed by October 2008. The International \nFinance Corporation is acting as the lead advisor to the Government and is providing some technical assistance on \nthe preparation of the bid documents and the bidding process. \n44 ADB is acting as Lead Advisor to the Government for the Sirajganj and Meghnaghat phase 3 projects. The process \nis expected to be completed by end of 2008.   \n45 Any reflows of the ADB loan from IDCOL to the Government due to the difference in tenor will have to be used by \nthe Government for lending activities with similar objectives and focus. \n ", "16 \nreflect IDCOL\u2019s cost of funds plus a spread to cover transaction costs and risks. Subloans will \nbe on full commercial and competitive terms46 at IDCOL\u2019s discretion. \n \n58.  The Government has also requested an $83 million equivalent loan from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources. The ADF loan will have a 32-year term, an 8-year grace period, and an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. It \nwill include such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n59.  The Government will make up to $50 million equivalent from the ADF loan available to \nIDCOL under a subsidiary loan agreement at the Bangladesh Bank rate47 with a 20-year term. \nIDCOL will onlend the proceeds from the ADF loan to SMIPs at market rates,48 while the \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n60.  To provide participating organizations with funding for renewable energy installations in \nrural areas in Bangladesh, the Government will make $33 million equivalent from the ADF loan \navailable to IDCOL at a fixed rate of 3% per annum or such higher rate as may be necessary. \nThis is to ensure that IDCOL\u2019s onlending spread to its sub-borrowers is not more than 300 basis \npoints,49 under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term, and with terms acceptable to \nADB. The proposed onlending terms to sub-borrowers reflect current market rates for this type \nof intervention. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.

For \nsubordinated loans, final maturity will be a maximum of 23 years, including an 8-year grace period. \n47 Bangladesh Bank Rate means the rate published by Bangladesh Bank on its website (http://www.bangladesh-\nbank.org) in accordance with Article 21 of the Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972, being the weighted average 6-month \nyield on the treasury bills of the Government. \n48 For small and medium-sized urban projects, IDCOL currently charges an interest rate of Bangladesh Bank Rate \nplus a spread of 400 basis points, provided however that the margin is not less than 250 basis points. The \nmaximum maturity is 12 years including a grace period of up to 3 years. For projects implemented in rural areas \nthat receive grants or subsidies from multilateral agencies and/or the Government, IDCOL charges an interest rate \nof up to 8% per annum with a maximum maturity of 10 years and a grace period of up to 2 years. \n49 IDCOL currently offers taka-denominated loans of 10-year maturity with a 2-year grace period at 6% per annum \ninterest to participating organizations. \n ", "17 \n61.  Table 2 assumes that IDCOL will finance up to its maximum allowed investment limit of \n40% of total cost to each subproject, therefore catalyzing 60% from private sector sponsors and \nbanks. In practice, IDCOL\u2019s share will typically vary between 10% and 30% to reflect the fact \nthat most infrastructure transactions are financed by a consortium of financial institutions, of \nwhich IDCOL will be one of the many participants. Hence, IDCOL\u2019s catalytic effect is expected \nto be much larger. \n \n62.  Parallel  Cofinancing.  Financing  from  commercial  sources  during  the  Project \nimplementation  period  will  be  encouraged  for  additional  investments  into  the  infrastructure \nsector of Bangladesh and to complement ADB financing. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB)50 \nhas allocated concessional financing of $15 million on similar terms as ADB\u2019s ADF loans for \nIDCOL\u2019s solar energy program (component C). Based on further review of a well-developed \npipeline of large power and infrastructure subprojects, IDB is processing an OCR-type funding \nof  up  to  $85  million  compliant  with  Shariah  principles  to  fund  eligible  large  infrastructure \nsubprojects (component A). Approval by IDB\u2019s board is expected to be obtained by January \n2009. IDB\u2019s cofinancing will be provided on a parallel cofinancing basis.51 \n \nE.   Special Features \n \n63.  The Government\u2019s request for promoting private sector participation in infrastructure \nfinancing is in recognition of ADB\u2019s extensive involvement in infrastructure development in \nBangladesh  and  the  region.  Consultations  with  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders, \nincluding development partners, enabled the design of the PPIDF to be that of a second-\ngeneration financial intermediation loan to address effective demand and is well anchored to the \nongoing  reforms  in  the  infrastructure  and  financial  sectors  aimed  at  bridging  the  growing \ninfrastructure financing gap.  \n64.  Transaction Costs. The PPIDF is designed to enable ADB to leverage its resources to \nfinance a wide range of subprojects across infrastructure subsectors rather than discretely \nfinance individual subprojects. This is expected to reduce transaction costs for the Government \nas well as for ADB.  \n65.  Public\u2013Private  Synergy.  The  PPIDF  draws  on  the  extensive  ADB  support  for \ninfrastructure  development  through  greater  private  sector  participation  in  other  developing \nmember countries. IDCOL is well-positioned to finance PPP subprojects. Financing of such \nsubprojects by a consortium of investors and lenders, including the PPIDF, ensures deepening \nof  subproject  preparation  and  financing  skills  and  options  in  the  country.  Among  the \ndevelopment  partners,  ADB  is  uniquely  placed  to  finance  PPP  subprojects  by  offering \ncustomized financing options through its public and private sector windows.   \n66.  Long-Term Benchmark Rate. By providing long-term lending on commercial terms, \nIDCOL  will  facilitate  pricing  of  risk  for  infrastructure  subprojects.  This  will  help  establish \n                                                 \n50 As per the aide memoire signed on 9 January 2008 between ADB and the IDB, both institutions have agreed to \ncollaborate to jointly set up an Asian Infrastructure Financing Facility of up to $2 billion over the next 3 years for \nsovereign-guaranteed operations that would participate in the prospective infrastructure subproject pipelines of \nboth institutions in common member countries. Any co-investment under the PPIDF would be the first such \nintervention under the aide memoire. \n51 A joint ADB-IDB mission went to Bangladesh on 18\u201324 June 2008 to introduce IDB to the Project, hold discussions \nwith the Government, and provide background information to IDB on the intervention. IDB already received \napproval from the Government to commence due diligence on its proposal to cofinance part of IDCOL\u2019s investment \nportfolio over the next 3 years alongside ADB. \n ", "18 \nbenchmark rates for infrastructure bonds, which will enable diversification of the investor base \nand bring in latent investors, boosting the corporate bond market. The presence of IDCOL as a \nlong-term financier in the market is also meant to provide comfort to equity investors who have \nexposure to subprojects for the length of the concession period. \n67.  Facilitative and Adaptive Design. Learning from experience (paras. 30\u201332), the PPIDF \nallows flexible lending criteria in terms of subproject selection, sector focus, and financing \ninstruments that can evolve as the financial and infrastructure reforms progress. While ADF and \nOCR funds have been correlated to subprojects types based on the extent of private sector \nparticipation and the clean energy priority, the onlending terms for both ADF ad OCR reflect \nlocal market terms to avoid currency and pricing mismatches (para. 32). The PPIDF is designed \nto complement IPFF (para. 28) in providing access to scarce long-term local currency funds. \nPPIDF and IPFF could collaborate with local commercial banks for financing subprojects. \n \n68.  Environment and Social Safeguard Framework. ADB took the lead in developing a \ncommon Environment and Social Safeguard Framework (ESSF) for harmonizing the safeguards \npolicy  framework  for  involuntary  resettlement,  the  environment,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nShowing remarkable awareness of the need for environmental and social safeguards in all \naspects of infrastructure development, IDCOL participated in the development of ESSF and \nadopted the same. This is the first ESSF developed for any financial institution in Bangladesh \nand will serve as a template for future financial sector interventions of ADB in the country. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n69.  Executing and Implementing Agencies. The Ministry of Finance, acting through its \nFinance Division, will be the executing agency and IDCOL will be the implementing agency of \nthe Project. IDCOL\u2019s board of directors will provide policy direction, strategic oversight and \noverall approval of subprojects. A project management unit (PMU) will be established to monitor \nthe screening and selection of subprojects and for day-to-day implementation of the Project. \nThe PMU will be staffed with existing IDCOL staff to the extent possible, and consist of risk and \nproject management experts. A senior officer, reporting directly to the chief executive officer of \nIDCOL, will be appointed to head the PMU. A dedicated finance and accounts officer will be in \ncharge of the financial management of the Project. The PMU will also house an environmental \nand social safeguards management unit to ensure and certify subproject compliance with the \nESSF. The environmental and social safeguards management unit will identify, screen, select, \nand monitor all subprojects, ensuring compliance with ADB, state, and national environmental, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people  policies.  The  PMU  will  also  develop  and \nimplement a project performance monitoring system (PPMS). \n \n70.  Sub-Borrower Selection Criteria. For a sub-borrower to receive funding from the ADB \nloan out of components A and B, IDCOL will apply the following eligibility criteria. The sub-\nborrower must \n(i)  be majority-owned (i.e., at least a 51% majority) by private sector parties and \ncontinue to be so for the duration of the subloan; \n(ii)  have  sponsors  that  have  a  proven  track  record  of  successfully  developing, \nfinancing, and operating similar infrastructure subprojects in Bangladesh or in \ncountries at a similar level of development; \n(iii)  have equity investment in respect of the subproject of at least 20% of the total \nsubproject costs; \n(iv)  have adequate resources and financial capability to raise and maintain resources \nto complete and operate the subproject successfully; \n ", "19 \n(v)  not be (nor its sponsors be) in default of any prior loan from IDCOL or from any \nof  the  participating  members  of  the  consortium  of  lenders  or  any  bank  or \nnonbank financial institution in Bangladesh; \n(vi)  be able to provide security as required by the consortium of lenders; \n(vii)  maintain  appropriate  financial  records  of  income  and  expenditure  to  the \nsatisfaction of IDCOL and ADB; \n(viii)  comply (and cause its relevant subproject to comply) with ADB\u2019s policies, and \nnational laws and regulations relating to environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples; and \n(ix)  have entered into relevant concession and/or license agreements, which provide \nfor satisfactory cost adjustment and escalation, or have signed memoranda of \nunderstanding in respect thereof. \n \n71.  Subproject Selection Criteria. For subprojects to be financed out of components A and \nB and biogas and biomass power plants to be financed out of component C, IDCOL will apply \nthe following eligibility criteria. The subproject must \n \n(i)  be  an  integral  part  of  the  borrower\u2019s  priority  plan  for  the  relevant  sector  or \nsubsector; \n(ii)  use technology which has a successful track record in countries with similar \ninfrastructure environment and capacity as Bangladesh; \n(iii)  be renewed and approved by IDCOL\u2019s credit committee for its economic and \ncommercial viability, and by the PMU for adherence to the ESSF; \n(iv)  obtain all necessary government approvals and licenses and comply with ADB\u2019s \npolicies and national laws and regulations relating to environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples; and \n(v)  have an economic rate of return of not less than 12%. \n \n72.  For solar energy subprojects to be financed out of component C, IDCOL will provide \nrefinancing facilities to those partner organizations that qualify with the eligibility criteria as \ndetailed in Appendix 7. \n \n73.  Approval Procedure for Subprojects. Subprojects under components A and B and \nbiogas and biomass power plants under component C will be prepared and processed as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  IDCOL will review the preliminary designs and cost estimates for all subprojects \nas approved by the lending consortium.  \n(ii)  IDCOL\u2019s  assessment  with  respect  to  any  issues  related  to  environmental, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, as stipulated in the ESSF, will \nbe reviewed and updated to ensure their relevance and consistency with the \napplicable legal framework in Bangladesh and ADB\u2019s environmental and social \nsafeguard requirements.  \n(iii)  IDCOL will collect from the sub-borrower the following documents and submit \nthem to ADB for approval: a detailed information memorandum or business plan, \na copy of the minutes from the meeting of IDCOL\u2019s board or credit committee \nthrough which the subloan was approved, compliance with respect to ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines, and a copy of the subloan agreement.  \n(iv)  IDCOL will periodically review ongoing subprojects to ascertain their compliance \nwith the approved safeguard frameworks. These review reports will be submitted \nto ADB, together with other relevant safeguard documents, for information and \n ", "20 \nreview. If any major noncompliance is found during such a review, ADB will \nrequest a corrective action plan, which will be prepared by IDCOL and submitted \nto ADB for review and approval. In addition, any subproject which is financed \nunder the PPIDF will follow the approved common safeguards frameworks. \n(v)  IDCOL will submit a safeguard compliance certificate to ADB for approval. \n \n74.  For the approval of solar energy subprojects under component C, IDCOL will collect \nfrom  the  participating  organizations  a  summary  sheet  which  will  provide  the  following \ninformation: (i) compliance with exposure limits for each participating organization, (ii) name and \naddress of each end-user, (iii) cost of equipment and any other related costs, (iv) total grant \namount received for each particular installation, and (v) net amount funded by IDCOL. \n \n75.  Economic Analysis of each Subproject. Each subproject should be subjected to an \neconomic analysis to establish economic viability. Economic analysis should be carried out \nfollowing the economic analysis guidelines52 and the analyses should cover all the key areas\u2014\nmacroeconomic and sector context, demand analysis, economic rationale, project alternative \nanalysis, cost\u2013benefit analysis, sustainability analysis, distribution analysis, and sensitivity and \nrisk analysis. Subprojects with an economic internal rate of return of less than 12% should not \nbe financed. \n \n76.  Maximum  Subloan  Size  and  Free  Limit. IDCOL\u2019s lending policy stipulates that it \ncannot finance more than 40% of the total subproject cost. This is applicable to all subprojects \nto be financed under components A and B. For the SMIPs to be financed under component B, \nIDCOL\u2019s total loan to each subproject cannot exceed $10 million. ADB is not stipulating any \nadditional limitation on the size of the subloans so as to provide sufficient flexibility to IDCOL in \nutilizing the funds, and to support the catalytic role of IDCOL in mobilizing financial resources \nfrom the private sector for large subprojects. However, all subprojects financed by IDCOL under \ncomponent A and the first three subloans to be provided by IDCOL from the proceeds of \ncomponent B will be subject to prior review and approval of ADB. Thereafter, for subsequent \nloans a suitable free limit pursuant to the provisions of the Operations Manual section on \nfinancial intermediation loans may be determined for IDCOL based on (i) ADB's assessment of \nIDCOL\u2019s performance, (ii) appraisal standards, (iii) portfolio quality, (iv) management, (v) the \nquality of IDCOL's subproject environmental due diligence reports submitted for ADB's review, \n(vi) IDCOL's management commitment to the application of ESSF, (vii) its safeguard capacity, \nand (viii) its subproject pipeline.53 ADB will, however, reserve the right to review subprojects \neven below the free limit to ensure safeguard compliance. Also, in the case of issues related to \nADB\u2019s safeguard policies, IDCOL will be required to submit all safeguard documents regardless \nof the investment amount. \n \n77.  Procurement. For subprojects under component A, IDCOL will require its sub-borrowers \nto adopt internationally competitive bidding procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Act \n(2006, as amended from time to time). ADB will have the right to review and approve the \nprocurement procedures. \n \n78.  For subprojects under components B and C, ADB will encourage IDCOL to require its \nsub-borrowers to adopt international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n52 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n53  ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section D6/OP: Financial Intermediation Loans. Manila (15 December). \n ", "21 \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  when  the  amount  of  the \ninvestment is large (equal to or more than $5 million equivalent) and economy and efficiency \ncan be gained by following such procedures.  \n \n79.  For procurement of goods and services to be financed by subloans out of the loan \nproceeds, the sub-borrower will ensure, and certify to ADB if requested, that goods and services \nobtained are suitable for the subloans, that the price paid is least-cost, and that account is being \ntaken of relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and reliability of goods.  \n \n80.  For  build-operate-transfer  subprojects  and  variants,  if  the  subproject  sponsor  or \nengineering, procurement, and construction contractor is selected through competitive bidding \namong international entities in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, such subproject \nsponsor  or  contractor  may  apply  its  own  procedures  for  procurement  provided  that  such \nprocurement is for goods, services, and works supplied from, or produced in, ADB member \ncountries. Moreover, such subproject sponsors or contractors must only be nationals of ADB \nmember countries. \n \n81.  Disbursement Arrangements. The Government will establish three imprest accounts \nwith the Bangladesh Bank: one for the OCR loan (component A), and one for each of the two \ncomponents under the ADF loan (components B and C). The initial amount deposited in each \nimprest account shall not exceed 10% of each loan, or estimated expenditures for the first 6 \nmonths of Project implementation, whichever is lower. IDCOL as the implementing agency will \nbe  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  collecting  supporting  documents, \npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending the applications to ADB in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and such other \narrangements as may be agreed between ADB and IDCOL. For disbursement amounts of less \nthan $100,000, IDCOL can follow statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures. The closing date \nfor the OCR loan and the ADF loan will be 31 December 2013 or such other date as may be \nagreed between ADB and the Government. \n82.  While making disbursements requests to ADB, IDCOL will submit to ADB the following \ndocuments (or such other documents as shall be satisfactory to ADB): \n \n(i)  Components A and B. (a) Evidence of payment of a subloan or requirement to \nmake  a  subloan  to  the  sub-borrower,  (b)  independent  assessment  and/or \nengineer's certificate on physical progress and financial progress, (c) a cash flow \nor utilization request verified by a chartered accountant, and (d) notice of draw \ndown by the agent of the sub-borrower confirming all conditions precedent to \ndisbursement are satisfied and no event of default has occurred or is continuing. \n(ii)  Component C. A copy of the summary sheet collected from each sub-borrower \ndetailing the number of SHSs being financed, the total cost per SHS, and the \ntotal amount of financing sought from ADB. \n(iii)  Components A, B, and C. Where the amounts are above the SOE ceiling, a \ncomplete set of supporting documents has to be provided to ADB. \n \n83.  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the Government and IDCOL. ADB has \n ", "22 \nassessed the financial management policies of IDCOL and found them to be satisfactory.54 \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the subprojects under the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are \nincluded in the loan regulations relevant to the Project. In addition, all subprojects financed by \nADB in connection with the PPIDF will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of IDCOL, its sub-borrowers, and other service providers \nas they relate to the subprojects.  \n \n84.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. IDCOL will establish and maintain separate \nrecords  for  works,  goods,  and  services  financed  out  of  loan  proceeds.  The  company  will \nmaintain separate Project accounts according to generally accepted accounting principles for all \nexpenditures incurred under the PPIDF and the subprojects, whether out of loan proceeds or \nfrom  other  sources,  and  record,  in  a  transparent  manner,  all  funds  received  from  the \nGovernment, ADB, and other sources. \n \n85.  Consolidated annual Project accounts, as maintained by IDCOL, will be (i) audited by \nindependent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable \nto ADB; and (ii) submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the financial year. The annual \naudit report will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds, free \nlimit, the soundness of the imprest fund and SOEs procedures, and compliance with financial \nloan covenants. IDCOL has been briefed on ADB\u2019s policy regarding delayed submission of \naudits and requirements for a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts. \n \n86.  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  IDCOL  will  be  responsible  for \nestablishing a PPMS acceptable to ADB no more than 3 months from loan effectiveness. For \nthe PPMS, IDCOL will first select a set of clearly measurable performance monitoring indicators \nrelating  to  implementation  and  improvements  and  institutional  development  and  capacity-\nbuilding milestones, including those in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \nIDCOL will establish baseline data for each of the selected indicators within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness. Subsequently, IDCOL will conduct annual surveys and will update ADB on the \nprogress against each indicator. IDCOL will also submit quarterly progress reports in the format \nto be attached to the facility administration memorandum. IDCOL will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report within 3 months of the completion of all ADB-supported subprojects.  \n \n87.  Project  Review.  ADB  will,  at  its  discretion,  conduct  reviews  of  the  management, \nfinancial, and operational performance of IDCOL and subprojects financed under the Project, \ninitially after the closing of withdrawals. The review will include safeguard implementation and \nprocurement procedures utilized by the PPIDF infrastructure subprojects.  \n \n88.  Performance of the PPIDF will be reviewed periodically at three levels\u2014monthly by \nIDCOL,  quarterly  by  IDCOL\u2019s  board  of  directors,  and  annually  by  ADB.  The  monthly \nperformance review by IDCOL will be completed by the 10th day of the next month. IDCOL\u2019s \nboard of directors will review the performance every quarter and will forward the quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB by the 10th day of the month after the quarterly review. ADB will review \nthe quarterly progress reports during annual review missions, and during the tripartite reviews \n                                                 \n54 Asset and Investment Management Services Bangladesh, a local investment firm, was hired to carry out the \nfinancial due diligence on IDCOL. \n ", "23 \nchaired by the Government. In addition, a midterm review of the investment program will be \nconducted in FY2010. The review will cover disbursement, implementation progress including \nprogress against capacity-building milestones, and compliance with environmental and social \naspects including safeguards implementation. The midterm review will identify problems or \nweaknesses in implementation; suggest nominal changes in scope, outputs, and due diligence; \nand agree on changes that may be needed. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n89.  To enhance the sustainability of the PPIDF, ADB will provide TA of $500,000. It will \ncommence in parallel to the loans and will be for 1.5 years. The TA will be available to IDCOL \nmainly to (i) assist line ministries in the drafting of proper PPP frameworks and policies in \nBangladesh  based  on  IDCOL\u2019s  experience  in  financing  private  sector-led  infrastructure \nsubprojects upon request of those line ministries; (ii) provide the Government and its agencies \nwith feedback about bottlenecks, issues, and concerns from the market and from private sector \nsponsors and offer advice and solutions; (iii) conduct economic, sector, and industry studies; (iv) \nsupport the development of additional capacity within IDCOL to appraise subprojects, manage \nits expanding subproject portfolio, and supervise the implementation of its renewable energy \nprogram;  (v)  provide  training  to  staff  in  relevant  government  agencies  in  credit  and  risk \nassessment,  management,  and  mitigation;  and  (vi)  provide  training  to  IDCOL  in  the \nenvironmental and social assessment of subprojects. \n \n90.  The Ministry of Finance, acting through the Finance Division, will be the executing \nagency and IDCOL will be the implementing agency. The TA outcomes will be monitored by the \nMinistry of Finance, ADB, and IDCOL through consultants\u2019 reports and periodic consultations \nand review missions. To carry out the TA, international consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The scale of consultant inputs, terms of reference, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements are described in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n91.  Benefits of the PPIDF are grouped into three areas: \n(i)  Beneficiaries. (a) The people of Bangladesh, especially in rural areas, who will \nhave increased access to more adequate and efficient infrastructure services; \n(b) the  Government,  which  will  benefit  through  the  addition  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment  resources  and  the  introduction  of  private  sector  efficiency  and \nmanagement culture in the infrastructure sectors; and (c) private sector investors, \nboth local and foreign, who will receive financial, institutional, and policy-related \nassistance for investment in new infrastructure subprojects in the country. \n \n(ii)  Macro  benefits.  (a)  Reduced  need  for  public  investment  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  thus  enabling  the  Government  to  deploy  more  funds  to  meet \npoverty alleviation and social development objectives; (b) rapid development of a \nmodern and efficient infrastructure system in Bangladesh through the financial, \ntechnical, and managerial resources of the private sector; (c) balanced economic \ngrowth in urban and rural areas; (d) increased FDI flow into new infrastructure \n ", "24 \nsubprojects; and (e) significant employment generation in the construction and \noperation of new infrastructure subprojects. \n \n(iii)  Project benefits. (a) Addition of at least 900 MW of power generation capacity in \nthe private sector; (b) provision of electricity to approximately 100,000 additional \nhouseholds through IDCOL's renewable energy programs; (c) development of \nsubprojects to enhance port capacity, establish new toll highways, and augment \nwater  supply;  and  (d)  increased  capacity  in  the  country  for  promoting \nenvironmentally friendly and socially acceptable implementation arrangements \nfor privately sponsored infrastructure subprojects. \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n92.  The PPIDF is classified as category FI in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002).  IDCOL  will  ensure  that  for  each  subproject,  an  initial  environmental  and  social \nexamination, environmental and social impact assessment, and environmental management \nplan, as applicable, will be carried out. For large subprojects to be financed under component A, \nIDCOL will submit the above documents for ADB\u2019s review and approval. For the SMIPs under \ncomponent B, IDCOL will submit to ADB for review and approval the above documents for the \nfirst  three  SMIPs  to  be  financed  by  the  company.  For  component  C,  which  includes  the \nfinancing of IDCOL\u2019s ongoing renewable energy program, environmental issues are expected to \nbe  minimal\u2014primarily  related  to  the  disposal  of  used  lead  acetate  batteries  and  compact \nfluorescent lamps. IDCOL will also ensure that all resettlement plans are submitted to ADB prior \nto its approval of each subproject. \n \n93.  As part of the ADB assistance to IDCOL, ADB helped prepare and finance the drafting of \nan ESSF55 (Appendix 9) based on IDCOL\u2019s existing environmental and social appraisal manual. \nThe ESSF outlines the operating procedures for addressing environmental and social issues \nassociated with project planning, development, and operation. The main purpose of the ESSF is \nto provide IDCOL and subproject sponsors with an overall framework to identify environmental \nand social effects and prepare necessary environmental and social documents to support the \nIDCOL loan appraisal process, and implement environmental and social programs both at the \nsubproject and organizational levels. The ESSF comprises the environmental management \nsystem (EMS) and the social safeguards framework (SSF). The provisions for environmental \nand social safeguards and assessment and mitigation measures contained in the EMS and SSF \nwill be applicable for all subprojects financed from the proceeds of the ADB loans. IDCOL will \nmonitor  that  the  subproject  developers  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  do  not  employ \nchildren or discriminate against women. IDCOL will not finance subprojects (using ADB funds) \nwhich  do  not  adequately  address  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards (ESS) requirements. The company will provide ADB with an annual environmental \nand social safeguard compliance monitoring report, showing that IDCOL has complied with its \nobligations  under  the  ESSF.  Supplementary  appendixes  G  and  H  provide  a  comparative \nassessment of the Government\u2019s environmental impact assessment (EIA) framework and the \nESS of ADB and a comparison of the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s social safeguard approach \nregarding involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n                                                 \n55 The process of preparing the ESSF was guided by ADB\u2019s Environment and Social Safeguards Division.

Investments in infrastructure as a whole and in road transport and electricity in particular \nhelp  reduce  income  poverty,  with  road  transport  improvements  having  a  stronger  impact. \nAccess to roads reduces prices under conditions of competitive transport services provision, \nincreases mobility, and reduces labor market imperfections, enabling the poor to find better \npaying work, thereby allowing production of higher-value cash crops and supply of cheaper \nagricultural  inputs.  Rural  electrification  helps  stimulate  the  rural  economy  and  increases \nopportunities for off-farm employment for the poor. Use of televisions in rural areas leads to \nimproved information on crops and contributes to improved farm productivity.  \n \n95.  Infrastructure projects also contribute to increased trade and growth in countries in the \ncontext of regional cooperation. The impact on nonincome poverty is also significant. Roads \nreduce travel time and provide better access to basic education and health services. Electricity \nalso impacts on nonincome poverty. Better lighting increases the time for studies and years of \nschooling. It increases safety and security and provides better medical services in rural areas. \nFurther information about the impact of infrastructure investments on poverty is provided in the \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy (Appendix 10). \n \nD.  Infrastructure Development Company Limited\u2019s Corporate Governance \n \n96.  ADB has carefully reviewed the corporate governance structure of IDCOL to ensure that \nsound and transparent business processes and management systems are in place to mitigate \nany potential corruption risks and vulnerabilities. IDCOL is governed by the Companies Act \n(Bangladesh) 1994 and the Financial Institutions Act 1993, which prescribe disclosure norms. \nIDCOL intends to self-regulate and has incorporated best practices of nonbanking finance \ncompanies. In addition, IDCOL has been rated AA and AA1 by two local rating agencies for \nstrengthening  its  compliance  with  best  international  practices. 57  A  governance  and \nanticorruption risk assessment is provided in Appendix 11.58  \n \nE.  Assumptions, Potential Risks, and Mitigation Measures \n \n97.  While the growing recognition of the significance of infrastructure development and the \nongoing reforms in the financial sectors provide the context for the facility, the envisaged \nbenefits and impact depend on several assumptions that are subject to varying degrees of risk. \nMitigation measures have been put in place where feasible and appropriate. \n \n98.  Effective  Demand.  A  strong  pipeline  of  private  sector-sponsored  infrastructure \nsubprojects  that  could  be  eligible  for  IDCOL  financing  has  been  identified.  The  estimated \nvolume of the expected funding for those subprojects is more than enough to absorb the \nproposed ADB loans to IDCOL. Several subprojects in the energy sector are at advanced \nstages of development. Some of these transactions are likely to be financed within the next 1\u20132 \nyears. A significant number of these subprojects are priority investments designed to address \ncrippling energy deficiencies, and ADB support through the PPIDF is perceived as critical to \novercoming financing constraints and facilitating their implementation. \n                                                 \n56 ADB. 2004.

Also available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2004/Global_Learning/Infra_Final.pdf. \n57 International credit rating agencies closely monitor all aspects of operational performance, and failure to comply \nwith best practice is likely to lead to a rating downgrade and an increase in financing costs. \n58 Supplementary Appendix I provides the Financial Management Assessment. \n ", "26 \n \n99.  Change in the Government\u2019s Policies. The current emphasis on private participation \nto boost infrastructure development and promotion of renewable energy may change. More \nrestrictive  laws  and  policies  concerning  infrastructure  project  financing,  foreign  investment, \ncurrency  exchange,  and  other  matters  affecting  the  ability  of  IDCOL  to  fund  infrastructure \nsubprojects might be implemented. The risk of adverse policies being introduced is considered \nminimal since the Government is keen to pursue infrastructure sector development. In addition, \nADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue with the Government will facilitate adoption of progressive sector \npolices. \n \n100.  Governance.  Good  governance  is  an  essential  precondition  for  sustainable \ndevelopment in Bangladesh\u2019s infrastructure sectors. The Government has put good governance \nat the center of infrastructure sector reform policies. Various measures have been included in \nthe  Project\u2019s  design  to  promote  good  governance  and  mitigate  the  risk  of  corruption  by \nenhancing predictability, transparency, and accountability in doing business. These measures \ninclude professional management of IDCOL (which is independent of the Government), and \ncontinued  commercialization  and  financial  strengthening  of  IDCOL.  In  addition,  IDCOL\u2019s \norganizational structure and business processes have been thoroughly assessed to determine \nvulnerability to corruption. A risk assessment has been undertaken and the Project design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  legal  arrangements  include  appropriate  risk  mitigation \nmeasures. \n \n101.  Institutional  Capacity.  IDCOL  needs  to  adopt  a  long-term  vision  and  operational \nstrategy based on commercial operations through an effective organization. While IDCOL\u2019s \npresent staff strength of 36 is commensurate to the current level of operations, it might not be \nequipped  to  cope  with  additional  and  more  complex  activities,  especially  relating  to  large \ninfrastructure subprojects. IDCOL currently outsources most of these activities. To address this, \nIDCOL has started to strengthen its subproject assessment capabilities and capacity and has \ninitiated its own marketing program to source potential business opportunities independently. \nThese activities will be further supported by the ADB TA with capacity building. To improve its \nskill  and  capacity,  IDCOL  will  also  enter  into  strategic  partnerships  with  international \norganizations involved in infrastructure investments, advisory services, and development of \nrenewable energy. \n \n102.  Environmental and Social Risks. As IDCOL will finance multiple subprojects, there is a \npotential risk that certain decisions by IDCOL during implementation may not fully adhere to \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  To  address  this  concern,  ADB  has  helped  develop  a \ncomprehensive ESSF which fully addresses environmental risks, involuntary resettlement, and \nimpacts on indigenous peoples arising from land acquisition, changes in land use, or restrictions \nof  access  to  resources.  IDCOL  will  also  avail  itself  of  the  ADB-sponsored  or  approved \nenvironmental and social safeguard training. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n103.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and IDCOL have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated into the loan agreements:  \n \n(i)  In the event of any change in the structure of IDCOL, the Government, IDCOL, \nand ADB will assess the potential impact on the Project and evaluate any change \nin scope, amendment, or continuation, as appropriate, of PPIDF. \n \n ", "27 \n(ii)  IDCOL complies at all times with the prudential norms, as made applicable to it, \nincluding capital adequacy, income recognition, classification, and provisioning of \nnonperforming assets.  \n \n(iii)  IDCOL maintains a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.0 and ensures that it \nhas no arrears in repayment of its current debt obligations. \n \n(iv)  The subprojects and sub-borrowers meet the eligibility criteria agreed with ADB, \nincluding financial and economic viability and positive developmental impact. \n(v)  All  subprojects  under  components  A  and  the  first  three  subprojects  under \ncomponent B are submitted to ADB for prior review, unless otherwise agreed \nbetween ADB and IDCOL. \n \n(vi)  The onlending rates to sub-borrowers are market-based, and adequate to cover \nall costs and risks associated with onlending, including any foreign exchange risk \npremium. \n \n(vii)  The sub-borrowers adopt and implement appropriate procurement procedures \nthat  are  based  on  competitive  bidding,  and  foster  economy,  efficiency,  and \ntransparency.  \n \n(viii)  A subloan to a sub-borrower will be made only for such subprojects that involve \nprocurement of goods, works and/or consulting services from member countries \nof ADB, and the amount of which is at least equal to the size of the subloan for \nsuch subproject. \n \n(ix)  Provisions are stipulated in all civil works contracts to require contractors to \n(a) incorporate  minimum  workplace  occupational  health  and  safety  norms  in \naccordance with national legislation, (b) comply with all applicable labor laws, \n(c) not employ child labor in any aspect of their activities, (d) provide appropriate \nfacilities  for  women  and  children  in  construction  campsites  if  such  sites  are \nestablished,  (e)  provide  appropriate  training  and  information  materials  for \nworkers on AIDS prevention using an NGO approved by the ministry of health, (f) \nobserve  local  protocols  concerning  acceptable  behavior  toward  the  local \npopulation, (g) use local unskilled labor, and (h) not differentiate between men \nand women for work of equal value. A specific clause shall be included in all \nbidding documents, and compliance shall be strictly monitored during Project \nimplementation. \n \n(x)  IDCOL  maintains its ESSF in accordance with its terms and conditions and \nacceptable to ADB to ensure that each subproject is undertaken in compliance \nwith applicable environmental laws of Bangladesh and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). IDCOL will also ensure that for each subproject under component A and \nB  and  biogas  and  biomass  power  plants  under  component  C,  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), EIA, and environmental management plan, as \napplicable, are submitted to ADB before its approval of the subproject. IDCOL \nwill also ensure that for any category A or environmentally sensitive category B \nsubproject, the summary IEE or the summary EIA is made available to the public \n120 days before a disbursement request is submitted to ADB and will be posted \non ADB\u2019s website. The company will ensure that full IEE or EIA reports will be \nmade available upon request. IDCOL will submit an annual monitoring report to \n ", "28 \nADB covering performance of subprojects and ESSF, and recommendations to \naddress issues. \n \n(xi)  IDCOL  ensures  that  each  subproject  which  involves  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  is  undertaken  in  compliance  with  all  the  applicable  laws  of \nBangladesh and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). IDCOL will also \nensure that all resettlement plans are submitted to ADB prior to its approval of \neach subproject, and cause each subproject sponsor to ensure that (a) all land \nand rights-of-way required for subproject are obtained in a timely manner, (b) the \nprovisions of  the  resettlement  plans  are implemented  in  accordance  with  its \nterms, (c) all compensation and resettlement assistance is given to the affected \npersons prior to their dispossession and displacement and commencement of \ncivil works, (d) resettlement plans are updated upon completion of the detailed \ndesign and submitted to ADB for approval prior to commencement of civil works, \n(e) adequate staff and resources are committed to supervising and monitoring \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans,  and  (f)  an  independent  agency \nacceptable to ADB and IDCOL is engaged by the subproject sponsor to monitor \nand evaluate results of implementation of resettlement plans and forward reports \nto ADB and IDCOL as required. \n \n(xii)  Subprojects  do  not  adversely  affect  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  indigenous \npeoples,  and  in  the  event  of  impact,  IDCOL  will  implement  the  ESSF  in \naccordance with its terms to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998).  \n \n(xiii)  For large subprojects to be financed under component A, IDCOL will be required \nto submit an initial environmental and social examination, an environmental and \nsocial  impact  assessment,  and  an  environmental  management  plan,  as \napplicable, to ADB for review and approval. For the SMIPs under component B \nand  biogas  and  biomass  power  plants  under  component  C,  IDCOL  will  be \nrequired to submit to ADB for review and approval the above documents for the \nfirst three SMIPs to be financed by the company. For subprojects to be funded \nunder  component  C,  which  includes  the  financing  of  renewable  energy \nsubprojects, environmental issues are expected to be minimal and no submission \nof the above documents is required. \n \n(xiv)  IDCOL will ensure that from the date of loan effectiveness, an adequate number \nof consultants with the required environmental and social expertise will be hired \nto carry out the functions as outlined in the ESSF. The consultants will also train \nIDCOL\u2019s staff to fully implement and comply with the ESSF. \n \n(xv)  IDCOL will hire a risk manager within 6 months of loan effectiveness to ensure \nthat  all  risks  related  to  credit,  market,  and  the  company\u2019s  operations  are \nindependently and objectively assessed, managed, and mitigated. \n \n(xvi)  Accountability  and  transparency  in  IDCOL  are  maintained  in  its  operations \nthrough the stakeholder meetings and publication of progress reports for the \nduration  of  the  Program.  Internal  procedures  and  controls  are  instituted, \nmaintained, and complied with to prevent any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive  practices.  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nsubprojects  specify  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \n ", "29 \naccounts of the sub-borrowers, contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the subprojects. \n \n(xvii)  All IDCOL subloan agreements appropriately reflect the obligations assumed by \nIDCOL and the respective subproject sponsors under the Project.  \n \nVII.

Power Sector \n \n1.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Bangladesh power sector has experienced numerous institutional and operational \nimprovements  during  2002\u20132008  but  huge  disparities  remain  between  the  various  sector \nentities as measured by their financial performances. With a total population of 140.7 million as \nof 2007, one third of the population has access to electricity1 and the distribution system has \n8.84  million  consumers.  While  the  two  key  sector  entities,  the  Power  Grid  Company  of \nBangladesh (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company, outperformed other entities, the \nBangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) \ncontinue to make financial losses. The power sector needs tariff adjustments, particularly for the \ndistribution to the retail sector, as the current tariff structure is not sufficient to cover costs and \nexpenses. There has been a reduction in system losses especially in transmission, however \nfurther improvements in distribution are needed.  \n \n2.  Power Sector Overview \n \n2.  In Bangladesh, inadequate electricity supply has been a major constraint to economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction. At about 158 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually, per capita generation \nis among the lowest in the world. The country\u2019s current dependable generating capacity is about \n4,120 megawatts (MW), while peak demand is about 4,700 MW. The available generation \ncapacity as of June 2005 was 5,025 MW, out of which 3,735 MW came from BPDB and 1,290 \nMW came from independent power producers and other entities.  \n \n3.  High system losses are a major concern for the Bangladesh power sector. During the \nlast 25 years, overall transmission and distribution losses have varied between 27.2% and \n40.2% of net generation. A high proportion of losses at transmission and distribution level \ninclude nontechnical losses (e.g., theft). Transmission system losses declined from 3.8% in \n2002 to 3.4% in 2005. Reduction of technical losses depends on large investments for upgrade \nand reinforcement of the transmission and distribution network and retrofitting of plants with \nmore  efficient  auxiliary  devices.  Reduction  of  nontechnical  losses  depends  on  good \nmanagement through administrative measures with some investment in supportive hardware \nsuch as meters and test instruments. In recent calculations, technical losses for the Rural \nElectrification Board (REB) system varied between 8% and 10% at different 33/11 kilovolt (kV) \nsubstations.  \n \n4.  Given the high cost of generation, which is partly due to supply shortages that force \nBPDB to purchase power from all available generation units regardless of cost and operational \nefficiency, the Government of Bangladesh is now pursuing several less costly natural-gas-fired \nindependent power producer projects totaling about 1,400 MW of new generation capacity. \n \n3.  Tariffs \n \n5.  The  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  three  types  of  tariffs:  (i)  wholesale  tariffs, \n(ii) transmission  wheeling  charges,  and  (iii)  retail  distribution  tariffs  charged  to  end-use \n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2006. Statistics for Monitoring Attainment of MDGs in Bangladesh. Dhaka. \n ", "Appendix 2  35 \nconsumers. Up until 2003, the Government had a semiannual automatic power tariff adjustment \nformula to reflect fuel price changes and local currency fluctuations. Since the establishment of \nthe  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  in  April  2004,  there  has  been  no  tariff \nadjustment  despite  significant  fuel  price  increases  and  local  currency  depreciations, \nexacerbating the financial difficulties of the sector entities caused by a very low wholesale tariff \nnot sufficient to cover generating costs. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) evaluation report2 \npoints out that the current tariff level is substantially below the long-run marginal cost estimated \nat Tk4.2 per kWh at the 132 kV supply point. The PGCB's tariff, with wheeling charges of Tk0.23 \nper kWh for bulk delivery to distribution entities, is sufficient for PGCB to have financial gains. \nThe transmission of electricity through the grid network has been steadily increasing, with \ngrowth of 9.2% in 2004 and 5.9% in 2005. Like wholesale generation tariffs, retail tariffs are not \nstructured for cost recovery and are essentially inflexible to such external price fluctuations as \nincreases in fuel costs, local currency depreciation, and inflation.  \n \n4.  Institutional Framework and Reform Overview \n \n6.  The East Pakistan Water and Power Authority, established in 1959, was the sole utility \nresponsible  for  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  sale  of  electricity  throughout  the \nprovince of the then East Pakistan. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1972, BPDB took \non  the  same  function.  In  1977,  the  REB  was  created  to  undertake  electrification  in  rural \nBangladesh. Since its creation, BPDB\u2019s commercial performance has been weak. To improve \nservices to the consumers and to increase revenue collection by reducing the prevailing high \nsystem loss, the Government created the DESA in March 1990. DESA took over the electrical \ndistribution network of about 7,472 square kilometers (km) in the Greater Dhaka area; the \nliabilities and receivables were also transferred to DESA, which started operating on 1 October \n1991  with  an  insufficient  capital  base.  Recognizing  the  need  to  improve  the  sector\u2019s \nperformance, the Government, in consultation with major development partners,3 adopted a \npolicy paper in 1994 entitled Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh.4 The policy paper outlined \nthe reform process to gradually remove constraints in the sector through (i) separating sector \nregulation and operation; (ii) creating autonomy and commercial orientation among the sector \nentities; (iii) unbundling generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv) increasing private \nsector participation. As part of the reform program, the Private Sector Power Generation Policy \nof Bangladesh was approved in October 1996 to facilitate the development of private sector \npower projects. The policy includes fiscal incentives, tax and value-added tax exemptions, and \ntariffs for bulk purchases. In 2000, the Government issued its Vision and Policy Statement for \nPower  Sector  Reforms5 that  further  clarified  specific  details  of  the  structural  changes  in \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution,  along  with  the  principles  of  corporatization  and \ncommercialization.  In  March  2003,  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act,  2003,  was \npassed  in  Parliament  for  its  establishment  as  an  independent  and  impartial  regulatory \ncommission to regulate electricity, gas, and petroleum sectors. In April 2004, the Bangladesh \nEnergy  Regulatory  Commission  started  operating.  It  was  established  as  an  independent \nregulatory body under the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act, 2003, to regulate \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

In 2006, the Government issued a 3-year plan \nfor power sector reforms to undertake further organizational restructuring towards improving \ncorporate governance and promoting commercialization.  \n \n7.  As a result of implementing the reform policy, several new public sector entities have \nbeen established and made operational. These include the Ashuganj Power Station Company, \nDhaka Electric Supply Company, the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh, PGCB, \nand the West Zone Power Distribution Company. In addition, private sector independent power \nproducers,  including  the  Rural  Power  Company,  have  been  established  and  have  started \noperations. The Government, through the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy and \nMineral Resources, wholly owns and supervises BPDB, DESA, and the REB.  \n \n5.  Generation \n \n8.  At present, about 85% of the power generation capacity in the country is gas-based, \n10% is based on imported fuel, and 5% is hydro power. In terms of energy generation, about \n90%  of  the  total  in  FY2005  was  from  gas-fired  power  plants.  Present  gas  reserves  and \nproduction are considered adequate to serve the existing power plants, and it is highly probable \nthat additional reserves could be developed to serve the needs of those power plants projected \nuntil 2025. Over the last 10 years, consumption of electricity in Bangladesh grew at an average \ncompound annual rate of 8.1% and it is expected that demand for electricity will grow at an \nannual rate of about 8.0% for the next 10 years. The ADB-funded power system master plan \nupdate projected that a total capacity expansion of 17,900 MW would be necessary by 2025, \n3,500 MW of which would be needed by 2010.6  \n \n6.  Distribution \n \n9.  Power distribution systems need to be expanded in tandem with the generation and \ntransmission capacity expansions to enable delivery of power to consumers. At present, several \nentities  are  involved  in  the  power  distribution  business  in  Bangladesh.  DESA7 and  Dhaka \nElectric Supply Company cover Dhaka areas, while Palli Bidyut Samities cover most rural areas \nand BPDB primarily covers urban areas outside Dhaka. The West Zone Power Distribution \nCompany is taking over BPDB\u2019s distribution networks in the western parts of the country, and \nthe North Western Zone Power Distribution Company is  taking over distribution networks in the \nnorthwest of the country. \n \nB.  Telecommunications Sector \n \n10.  Telecommunications is a rapidly growing capital-intensive sector in Bangladesh with \nincreasing needs for financing. The fixed telephony is inadequate and outmoded, resulting in \nlow teledensity.8 Due to the emergence of private sector mobile and fixed telephone operators, \nthe industry has flourished since 1996, growing into the current large market with over 20 million \nconnections.  As  of  July  2007,  there  were  28  million  mobile  phone  and  1.1  million  fixed \ntelephone users in the country, resulting in a teledensity rate of 19.8. The estimated current \ndemand is around 40 million mobile and 1.5 million fixed telephone connections. There are five \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Power Sector \nDevelopment Program II (Financed by the Japan Special Fund). Manila.  \n7  Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited will take over DESA\u2019s operations.  \n8  Teledensity is the number of fixed lines per 100 people. \n ", "Appendix 2  37 \nprivate and one public sector mobile phone companies, 14 private public-switched telephone \nnetwork (PSTN) operators, and one state-owned fixed telephone operator. The central zone, \ncomprising the capital (Dhaka city) was opened for PSTN licensing in August 2007 and the \nBangladesh Telecom Regulatory Commission has awarded licenses to three operators. The \nPSTNs use wireless technology like code division multiple access, not requiring any cable \nconnectivity.  \n \n11.  The per capita telecommunications services expenditure in Bangladesh is 1.3% of gross \ndomestic  product  compared  with  3%  in  developed  countries.  Before  opening  up  of  the \ntelecommunications sector in 1996, the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (the only \ntelecommunications  operator  at  the  time),  could  not  fully  explore  the  telecommunications \nmarket.  \n \nC.  Transport Sector \n \n12.  Bangladesh  needs  vastly  improved  transport  and  other  infrastructure  for  sustaining \nhigher  gross  domestic  product  growth  over  the  medium  term.  Due  mainly  to  inadequate \ntransport infrastructure, the average cost for exports is 80% higher and for imports 35% higher \nthan  for  most  countries  in  the  region.  This  creates  significant  drag  on  the  economy.  The \nBangladesh transport system for domestic and international traffic consists of roads, railway, \ninland waterways, seaports, maritime shipping, and civil aviation. The extensive and diversified \nsystem consists of 140,000 km of roads, 2,706 km of railroads, 5,970 km of perennial and \nseasonal  waterways,  two  major  seaports,  and  three  international  (Dhaka,  Chittagong,  and \nSylhet) and eight domestic airports.  \n \n13.  The public sector develops and maintains transport infrastructure, including most rail and \nport services. Private sector involvement in road, inland water transport and ocean shipping has \nincreased significantly in recent times. The private sector has also been involved over the past \ndecade in domestic air transport and more recently in international (regional) air transport, the \npassenger rail market, and transport logistics. The inland waterways system is limited due to \ngeographical  reasons;  a  large  number  of  rivers  lack  high-capacity  bridges  and  there  is  a \nconsequent reliance on ferries, which results in the use of small trucks for intra- and inter-urban \ndistribution services. Limited network capacity and poor infrastructure constrain rail services, \nwith major rail sections deteriorating due to inadequate maintenance. Unfavorable regulations \nand subsidies limit cost recovery for all modes of transportation. Asset replacement, particularly \nfor  the  railways,  is  inadequate  and  unplanned,  resulting  in  low  transport  quality  and  high \ntransport costs.  \n \n14.  The road sector performance has improved in the past several decades, aided by road \nnetwork extensions and rapid increases in road transport demand. This has led to the shifting of \nmodal share of transport in favor of roads, which have become the principal mode of transport. \nThe  seaports  are  constrained  by  outmoded  customs  regulations,  physical  capacity,  and \ninadequate hinterland transport connectivity. \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \nINFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED  \n \nA.  Constitutional Documents and Ownership \n \n1.  The  Infrastructure  Development  Company  Limited  (IDCOL)  was  created  by  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh with assistance from the World Bank as part of the Private Sector \nInfrastructure  Development  Project1 (PSIDP).  IDCOL  was  registered  as  a  public  limited \ncompany under the Companies Act, 1994, and licensed by the Bangladesh Bank as a nonbank \nfinancial  institution  on  5  January  1998.  IDCOL\u2019s  share  capital  is  fully  subscribed  by  the \nGovernment. \n \n2.  IDCOL's mission is to promote economic development in Bangladesh by encouraging \nprivate sector investments in infrastructure subprojects. Its specific development objectives are \nto \n  \n(i)  participate  in  the  financing  of  privately  owned  infrastructure  subprojects  by \nproviding structured finance in the form of senior and subordinated loans; \n(ii)  mobilize  third-party  lending  from  private  sources  to  privately  sponsored \ninfrastructure subprojects at financial closing of subproject development; \n(iii)  provide investment advisory services to development subprojects that are led by \nprivate Bangladeshi developers; \n(iv)  provide  refinancing  for  small  infrastructure  subprojects  (renewable  energy) \nimplemented by nongovernment organizations and microfinance institutions, and \nother private entities; and   \n(v)  arrange  technical  assistance  for  private  sponsors  and  executing  agencies \npromoting small infrastructure and renewable energy subprojects. \n \nB.  Management \n \n3.  IDCOL  has  a  multiskilled  workforce  comprising  economists,  financial  and  market \nanalysts, engineers, lawyers, information technology experts, and accountants. IDCOL follows a \ncompetitive  career  path  for  its  workforce.  The  low  turnover  of  senior  staff  indicates  good \npersonnel management. \n \nC.  Strategy \n \n4.  Being a government agency charged with fostering infrastructure development of the \ncountry, IDCOL adopts and crafts its strategy in line with the policy of the Government. In the \npast,  IDCOL\u2019s  strategy  was  also  vested  on  the  support  it  received  from  its  development \npartners. IDCOL\u2019s business activities and programs are designed to take into account the local \nconditions. Initially, IDCOL was designed to have a finite life, i.e., to end with the specific \nsubprojects it carried out on behalf of its development partners. However, the Government \ndecided to convert IDCOL into a company with corporate structure and boosted its capital basis. \nIn its present form, IDCOL is financially independent of both the Government and development \npartners, and can meet its operational expenses from its own income.  \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1997. Private Sector Infrastructure Development Project . Washington, DC. \n ", "Appendix 3  39 \nD.  Products and Services \n \n5.  Currently, IDCOL is involved in five distinct programs:  \n(i)  financing small, medium, and large infrastructure subprojects; \n(ii)  refinancing nongovernment credits of organizations and microfinance institutions \nfor the promotion of renewable energy subprojects; \n(iii)  arranging both debt and equity financing for eligible infrastructure subprojects; \n(iv)  providing  financial  advisory  services  to  financial  institutions  and  subproject \nsponsors; and \n(v)  organizing training courses on project finance and financial modeling.  \n \n6.  IDCOL has contributed to capacity building in the project financing area in Bangladesh \nby conducting numerous training courses and assistance to its participating institutions. The \ncompany provides professional training on project finance and finance modeling to mid-level \nand senior professionals of banks, financial institutions, and private companies. Over the last 8 \nyears, IDCOL has trained nearly 400 professionals through various courses and workshops. \n \nE.  Lending Policies \n \n7.  As  a  lender  to  small,  medium,  and  large  infrastructure  subprojects,  IDCOL  is  a \ncomplementary  source  of  funds  and  is  able  to  provide  loans  covering  up  to  40%  of  the \nsubproject cost within the framework of an appropriate financing plan. \n  \n8.  The subproject developer or sponsor is expected to infuse a level of equity that is \nappropriate  to  the  subproject  considering  the  risks  associated  with  its  implementation  and \noperation but, at a minimum, that investment must be at least 20% of the total subproject cost. \nBanks and other credit institutions (both public and private) often cooperate with IDCOL in \ndrawing up the overall financing packages for major subprojects and participating with loans and \nother services.  \n \nF.  Loan Classification \n \n9.  In terms of loan classification, IDCOL follows the provisions of the Bangladesh Bank\u2019s \ncircular No. 8 of 3 August 2002, circular No. 11 of 31 October 2005, and circular No. 3 of May \n2006, which is applicable for all nonbank financial institutions in Bangladesh operating under a \nBangladesh Bank license. IDCOL does not have any special provision or arrangement of its \nown in this regard.

Business Process and Documentation  \n \n10.  IDCOL has a well-devised set of assessment tools and policies in place, which conforms \nto international standards. The company\u2019s business processes are documented in its project \nappraisal manual, which was prepared by an international consultant under the World Bank-\nfunded  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  The  consultant  also  conducted \ntraining in this regard for the employees of IDCOL. Subprojects financed by IDCOL are typically \nfunded on a limited recourse basis.  \n \nH.  Monitoring \n \n11.  Depending on the complexity and size of an individual subproject, a team of two dealing \nofficers is normally assigned for the monitoring of a single subproject. However, the major role \nof monitoring typically lies with the lead arranger; therefore, regular inspections and close \nmonitoring are normally done by IDCOL for those subprojects in which the company assumes \nthe role of an arranger. For other subprojects where IDCOL only participates as a member of a \nconsortium, its role is limited to carrying out a review of the progress report from the lead \narranger and certifying the conditions precedent prior to the disbursement of any loan tranche. \nIn cases where IDCOL assumes the role of the security custodian, the company also verifies \nand validates physical custody of all original contracts and securities documents. IDCOL also \noutsources expertise from specialized consultants and engineering universities, such as the \nBangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and other public and private universities, \nfor evaluation and verification of subprojects, the preparation of market studies and for the \ninspection of subproject plants and machinery.  \n \nI.  Corporate Governance Structure of the Infrastructure Development Company \nLimited \n \n1.  Board of Directors \n \n12.  As per IDCOL\u2019s memorandum and articles of association, the number of directors will \nnot be less than four or more than nine, or such number as may be determined from time to \ntime by IDCOL in its general meeting in accordance with the aforesaid limit and provisions of the \nCompanies Act (Bangladesh), 1994. Currently, IDCOL has an eight-member board of directors \nconsisting of four high government officials, three leading businessmen from the private sector, \nand one executive director and chief executive officer. The secretary of the Economic Relations \nDepartment presently chairs the board.  \n \n13.  With representatives from both private sector and government, the composition of the \nboard of IDCOL is a key factor in the success of the company. Although the Government \nappoints all the directors, its board and management have a track record of independence \nregarding investment decisions on the basis of the subproject. \n \n14.  Proposals requiring an IDCOL board decision must be submitted in written form to the \nboard for consideration. Decisions can be taken by the board either unanimously or based on \nsimple  majority.  IDCOL  has  a  comprehensive  administrative  manual  that  provides  for \nadministrative procedure of the company. Any change in the manual requires prior approval of \nthe board. IDCOL\u2019s board meets once every month. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  41 \n \n2.  Infrastructure Development Company Limited\u2019s Board Committees \n \n15.  IDCOL\u2019s  board  forms  special  committees  comprising  board  members  or  any  other \nexternal  and  independent  members  for  special  purposes.  The  following  are  the  existing \ncommittees of the IDCOL board. \n \na.  Credit Committee \n \n16.  The credit committee of IDCOL is primarily responsible for reviewing all final term sheets \nand subproject appraisal reports before these are submitted to the board for approval. The \napproval of this committee is mandatory before these documents are submitted to the board for \nfinal approval. The credit committee also makes recommendations for pricing of all IDCOL \nloans. The five-member committee is currently headed by the secretary of the prime minister's \noffice. The other four members are the secretary of the Power Division, two private sector \ndirectors of IDCOL\u2019s board, and IDCOL's chief executive officer.  \n \nb.  Recruitment and Promotion Committee  \n \n17.  The  recruitment  and  promotion  committee  of  IDCOL  is  a  six-member  committee \ncomprising IDCOL's chairman, the secretary of the Power Division (director), the secretary of \nthe  prime  minister's  office  (director),  two  directors  nominated  from  the  private  sector,  and \nIDCOL's  chief  executive  officer.  The  committee  is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  making \nrecommendations to the board regarding all new recruitment and promotion of personnel within \nIDCOL. All performance evaluations of internal staff and recruitment of new staff are done in \naccordance with the provisions under the operational manual. All written tests for recruitment \nare conducted independently by a university. Only short-listed candidates are then interviewed \nby the recruitment and promotion committee. Promotion of existing qualified staff is also done \non the basis of performance and length of service.  \n \nc.  Audit Committee \n \n18.  In compliance with the audit requirements of its various development partners, IDCOL \nhas a two-member audit committee to assure the independence of its internal control functions \nand audit activities. This committee is responsible for (i) overseeing activities of IDCOL's internal \nauditor, (ii) defining the scope of the IDCOL audit, and (iii) taking appropriate actions to address \nany violations of independence that are brought to its attention by IDCOL internal and external \nauditors. \n \nJ.  Conclusion \n \n19.  The operations of IDCOL are governed by the Companies Act (Bangladesh), 1994, and \nthe segregation of policy making, implementation, functional responsibilities, and the absence of \nloan origination within the organization point towards a corporate governance structure that \nincorporates international best practices. The corporate governance structure of IDCOL is also \nsubject to review by the two domestic credit rating agencies, and noncompliance would have an \nimmediate and adverse impact on IDCOL\u2019s funding program. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 4 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT  \nCOMPANY LIMITED \n \n1.  Credit Rating. The Government of Bangladesh is currently in the process of obtaining a \nsovereign credit rating from reputable international rating agencies such as Moody\u2019s, Standard \nand Poor\u2019s, and Fitch. In May 2007, the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), \na 100% government-owned company, received its initial ratings from the two Bangladeshi rating \nagencies\u2014AA from the Credit Rating Information and Services Limited and AA1 from the Credit \nRating Agency of Bangladesh. \n \n2.  The above ratings are the highest rating afforded to any local financial institution in \nBangladesh. The key determining factors for IDCOL\u2019s rating include (i) its policy role of financing \nBangladesh\u2019s infrastructure development, (ii) its links with the state, (iii) strong liquidity, (iv) good \nprofitability, and (v) good asset quality. \n \n3.  Capital. IDCOL has adequate capital for its operation. As of June 2008, its total paid-in \ncapital was Tk400 million, an increase from Tk260 million in 2006. The paid-up capital of the \ncompany is expected to be increased to Tk500 million this year through the accumulation of \nretained earnings. It was only Tk100,000 as of 30 June 2005, and the Government has since \ninjected significant capital. Total shareholder equity including retained earnings was Tk548 \nmillion as of June 2008. Since most of IDCOL\u2019s past loans were booked off-balance sheet, \nIDCOL\u2019s debt\u2013equity ratio is only 2.57, which indicates ample room for borrowing from external \nsources, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and expanding its on-balance sheet \noperations. \n \n4.  IDCOL has paid a cash dividend of Tk30 million in its FY2007 and has proposed to pay \nanother Tk30 million in FY2008, both of which are reasonable considering its capital base and \nprofit level.  \n \n5.  The Ministry of Finance holds 99.97% of the total shareholding and the remaining 0.03% \nis held by representatives from the Government and IDCOL.  \n \n6.  Balance Sheet and Asset Quality. The total assets of IDCOL stood at Tk2.0 billion as \nof June 2008. The company\u2019s asset size has been rapidly increasing, from Tk444.0 million in \nFY2006 to Tk1.35 billion in FY2007 representing an increase of 203%. Since past lending \nprograms funded by external resources such as the World Bank and KfW were classified as off-\nbalance, the on-balance source of funding is dominated by loans and paid-in capital from the \nGovernment. IDCOL\u2019s assets include long-term loans of Tk980 million, short-term investments \nof Tk459.0 million, and short-term loans and advances of Tk238.0 million. Reflecting IDCOL\u2019s \nrapid expansion of its on-balance lending activities, supported by the capital enhancement, the \ncompany\u2019s portfolio of total loans and advances increased by Tk862.7 million, or 717%, in \nFY2007.  \n \n7.  To date, IDCOL has financed 14 subprojects in the power, energy, telecommunications, \nports, and information technology sectors, of which three were financed as off-balance sheet \ntransactions  amounting  to  Tk8.5  billion,  and  eleven  were  on-balance  sheet  transactions \namounting to Tk1.5 billion.  \n \n8.  Table A4.1 shows IDCOL\u2019s portfolio as of June 2008, including both off-balance sheet \nand on-balance sheet lending. While 86.6% of IDCOL\u2019s credit portfolio still consists of off-\nbalance sheet items, the company is not pursuing further off-balance sheet financing. The \n ", "Appendix 4  43 \nquality of the current portfolio is excellent since there has been no principal or interest overdue \non IDCOL\u2019s loan portfolio. One significant risk factor, however, is the concentration of its on-\nbalance sheet lending; the outstanding balance of the Tk628 million loan to Pacific Bangladesh \nTelecom accounts for 52.3% of its total on-balance sheet loans and 32.0% of its total assets. \nIDCOL is aware of this risk and is in the process of mitigating the risk by the diversification of its \nportfolio through new loans to various borrowers and sectors. While the largest loan by IDCOL \nhas been the $80 million loan to Meghnaghat Power Project, which accounts for 57.3% of the \ntotal portfolio, this item is classified as off-balance sheet under the Private Sector Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project.  \n \nTable A4.1: IDCOL\u2019s Outstanding Portfolio as of 30 June 2008 \n \n  Amounta  Share of  Share of \nProjecta  (Tk  Category  Total \nmillion)  (%)  Portfolio \n(%) \nOff-Balance Items       \nA.

Profitability. IDCOL\u2019s asset base and return on assets over the past 3 fiscal years have \ngrown  substantially.  An  impressive  improvement  in  IDCOL\u2019s  profitability  was  observed  in \nFY2008 when the company generated an after-tax profit of Tk140.0 million compared with \nTk75.0 million in FY2007 and Tk17.0 million in FY2006. Despite the rapid increase in its asset \nsize, the return on asset ratio also improved, from 5.6% to 7.1% reflecting IDCOL\u2019s expansion of \nits asset base, accompanied by the improved ability to generate additional profit through its on-\nbalance sheet activities.  \n \n10.  The main drivers have been two income components: income from IDCOL\u2019s renewable \nenergy subprojects, and interest from loans of the infrastructure subprojects it financed. In terms \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \nof the income from renewable energy subprojects, the management fees of the new solar \nprogram  sponsored  by  the  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  contributed  an \nadditional Tk87.8 million. With respect to the interest generated from infrastructure subprojects, \nthe new loans to Pacific Bangladesh Telecom produced additional revenue of Tk58.3 million in \ntotal. \n \n11.  Table A4.2 shows that the income from loans accounts for 41.8% of IDCOL\u2019s total \nincome, and this figure highlights IDCOL\u2019s expansion of its on-balance sheet lending, which is \npart of its strategy to finance privately sponsored infrastructure subprojects from its own balance \nsheet. While the level of the income from project finance (which mainly consists of monitoring \nand other fees from off-balance sheet transactions) remains stable, the proportion declined to \n7.1% in FY2008 compared with 12.1% in FY2007 and 29.1% in FY2006. \n \nTable A4.2: Income Contribution, FY2006\u2013FY2008 \n(Tk million) \n \nItem  FY2008    FY2007    FY2006 \n  Amount  %    Amount  %    Amount  % \nIncome from project finance  20.4  7.1    20.5  12.1    21.9  29.1 \n(off-balance sheet transactions) \nIncome from renewable energy  102.5  35.9    56.6  33.2    16.0  21.2 \nprojects \nIncome from loans (on-balance  119.4  41.8    65.0  38.2    11.7  15.5 \nsheet transactions) \nIncome from short-term  36.9  12.9    26.6  15.6    23.8  31.5 \ninvestment \nOther income  6.7  2.3    1.5  0.9    2.1  2.8 \nTotal  285.9  100.0    170.2  100.0    75.4  100.0 \nSource: Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \n \n12.  With  respect  to  recurrent  expenses,  general  and  administration  expenses  slightly \ndecreased. Other noncash items such as depreciation and amortization remained almost the \nsame as the previous year.  \n \n13.  Cash Flow. IDCOL has been sustaining stable cash flow from FY2005\u2013FY2008. The net \ncash flow was \u2013Tk11.4 million in FY2005 and positive net cash flows were recorded in FY2006 \n(Tk18.0 million), FY2007 (Tk61.6 million) and FY2008 (Tk158.6 million). While cash flows from \noperating activities were negative in the past three years, the shortfall increased from Tk27.9 \nmillion in FY2007 to Tk149.1 million in FY2008. This was mainly due to IDCOL\u2019s increased \ninvestment in fixed deposits. Due to the positive net cash flow, IDCOL has cash and cash \nequivalent of Tk246.8 million as of June 2008. \n ", "Appendix 5  45 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR \n \nTable A5.1: World Bank \nAmount  Date \nProject Name  ($ million)  Approved \n       \nHaripur Power Project  183.00   1 Jun 2000\n       \nAir Quality Management Project  5.93   25 Jul 2000\n       \nRenewable Energy Development Project  8.20   5 Jun 2002\n       \nRural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development  290.10   25 Jun 2002\n       \nSocial Investment Program Project  22.54   18 Mar 2003\n       \nRural Transport Improvement Project  255.00   19 Jun 2003\n       \nTelecommunications Technical Assistance Project  11.11   19 Jun 2003\n       \nPower Sector Development Technical Assistance Project  20.50   3 Jun 2004\n       \nBangladesh Water Supply Program Project  55.11   17 Jun 2004\n       \nInvestment Promotion and Financing Facility  105.20   2 May 2006\n       \nRailway Reform Programmatic Development Policy Credit  40.00   19 Oct 2006\n       \nSocial Investment Program (Supplemental)  9.45   24 May 2007\n       \nWater Management Improvement Project  136.70   18 Sep 2007\n       \nTotal  1,142.84     \nSource: Compiled from World Bank projects database website.     \n \n ", "46  Appendix 5 \n \nTable A5.2: Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nAmount  Date \nProject Name  (\u00a5 million)  Approved \n       \nRural Electrification Project (Phase V-B)  1,460.0   29 Mar 2001\n       \nGreater Faridpur Rural Infrastructure Development Project  4,055.0   29 Mar 2001\n       \nRupsa Construction Project  8,300.0   29 Mar 2001\n       \nPaksey Bridge Construction Project (II)  9,209.0   31 Mar 2003\nEastern Bangladesh Rural Infrastructure Development         \nProject  11,345.0   22 Mar 2005\nGrid Substations and Associated Transmission Lines         \nDevelopment Project  4,642.0   29 Jun 2006\n       \nKarnaphuli Water Supply Project  12,224.0   29 Jun 2006\n       \nTelecommunication Network Development Project  8,040.0   29 Jun 2006\n       \nTotal  59,275.0     \nSource: Compiled from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation ODA project data website. \n     \nTable A5.3: German Development Cooperation through KfW \nAmount  Date \nProject Name  (\u20ac million)  Approved \n              \n230 kV Transmission Line Baghabari-Bogra  23.7   2001 \n(cofinancing with ADB West Zone Power System \nDevelopment Project)     \n              \nRenewable Energies I \u2013 Solar Energy Installations  16.5   2002 \n              \nRural markets and roads, Khulna Division  15.0   2002 \nTotal  55.2    \nSource: KfW. http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/EN_Home/Countries_and_Projects/Asia/South_and_Central_ \nAsia/Bangladesh63/Projects.jsp. \n \n \n \n ", " \nPROJECT DESIGN\nGrant   \n  Financing \n \n  Grant \n \nComponent C      Component B      Component A        \n \nADB                                         ADB                               ADB                              ADB \n \n \nADF (in SDR)  ADF (in SDR)  OCR \n  $5 million  $33 million  $50 million  $82 million  \n  equivalent  equivalent \n \n \n             Government                    Government                          Government                         Government \n \n  Taka   Taka \nOCR \n  $5 million  $33 million  $50 million \n$82 million  \nequivalent  equivalent \n \n   \n           IDCOL                               IDCOL                            IDCOL                         IDCOL                   \n \n \n \nG  rant Allocation  Refinancing  Loan in taka of up to  Loan in US dollars of \n  40% of project cost  up to 40% of project \n  cost \n \n  POs  POs  POs     \n    LIPs  LIPs \n  SMIPs  SMIPs \n   Grant   Microcredit           A\n  SMIPs of  LIPs of more than  pp\n$30 million size  e\n  less than  n\n(Promoter needs  d\n$30 million  ix\nto provide at least   6\nsize located   \n20% equity) \nin rural \n                       \n   4\nS olar Home Systems  Biogas Plants  7\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, IDCOL = Infrastructure Development Company Limited, LIP = large infrastructure \nsubproject, OCR = ordinary capital resources, PO = participating organization, SDR = Special Drawing Rights, SMIP = small and medium-sized infrastructure \nsubproject. \nNote: POs comprise nongovernment organizations and monetary financial institutions. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS  \n \nA.

Solar Energy Program \n \n1.  Objective \n \n2.  The objective of the program is to support Bangladesh\u2019s efforts to raise levels of social \ndevelopment and economic growth by increasing access to electricity in remote rural areas and \nto reduce carbon emissions by overcoming market barriers for renewable energy development. \nIDCOL\u2019s solar energy program has the mission of fulfilling basic electricity requirements in the \nrural areas of Bangladesh and supplementing the Government\u2019s vision of Electricity for All by \n2020. IDCOL, with support from various development partners, is channeling funds to small-\nscale renewable energy subprojects under this program. \n \n2.  Program Overview \n \n3.  The  program  is  being  implemented  through  nongovernment  organizations  and \nmicrofinance  institutions  referred  to  as  participating  organizations.  So  far  15  participating \norganizations1 have signed participation agreements with IDCOL to work under the solar energy \nprogram.  \n \n4.  Participating  organizations  select  subproject  areas  and  potential  customers,  extend \nloans, install the systems, and provide maintenance support. IDCOL will provide grants and \nrefinancing, set technical specifications for solar equipment, develop publicity materials, provide \ntraining, and monitor the performance of participating organizations. IDCOL offers soft loans of \n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee Foundation, Bangladesh Rural Integrated Development for Grub-\nStreet,  Center  for  Mass  Education  in  Science,  COAST  Trust,  Grameen  Shakti,  Hilful  Fuzul  Samaj  Kalyan \nSangstha, Integrated Development Fund, Mukti, Padakhep Manabik Unnayan Kendra, Palli Daridra Bimochan \nFoundation, Rural Services Foundation, Shubashati, SRIZONY Bangladesh, Thengamara Manila Shabuj Shangha, \nand Upakulio Biddutayan O Mohila Unnayan Samity.  ", "Appendix 8  51 \n10-year maturity with a 2-year grace period at 6% per annum interest to the participating \norganizations. Usually, IDCOL does not require any collateral or security for the loan, except for \na  lien  created  on  the  subproject  accounts.  Unless  and  until  there  is  an  event  of  default, \nparticipating organizations are authorized to operate the subproject accounts on their own.  \n \n5.  Households can buy solar home systems (SHS) either in cash or on credit. Participating \norganizations extend loans on various terms and conditions to the households for purchase of \nSHSs. The loan tenor varies from 1 to 5 years, and the interest rate varies from 8% to 15% per \nannum on declining balance method and 10% to 15% per annum on equal principal payment \nmethod. In all instances the repayment frequency is monthly. \n \n6.  Under the participation agreements, the households are required to pay a minimum of \n10% of the system cost as a down payment. On receipt of the down payment, the participating \norganizations  enter  into  a  sale  or  lease  agreement  (provisions  of  which  are  approved  by \nIDCOL), install the system, and make electronic disbursement requests to IDCOL for refinance \nand  grants,  as  applicable.  Installations  are  usually  made  within  1  month  from  the  down \npayment,  sometimes  within  2\u20133  days  depending  on  the  practice  of  each  participating \norganization. After in-house checking, IDCOL conducts a physical verification of the SHSs \ninstalled.  IDCOL  releases  grants  and  refinance  amounts  only  if  the  inspection  result  is \nsatisfactory. While a typical 50 watt SHS costs around $400, the refinance amount does not \nexceed $230 equivalent in taka per system. IDCOL makes the disbursement within 21 days \nfrom the receipt of disbursement request.  \n \n7.  In addition to refinancing, IDCOL provides grants to bring down the capital cost of SHSs \nand to meet the incremental operating costs of the participating organizations and thus build \ntheir institutional capacity. Since IDCOL\u2019s principal objective is the commercialization of SHSs, it \nhas adopted a policy of declining grant with the progress of the subproject, which is shown in \nTable A8.2 below. The current grant is approximately 10% of the total cost, while over 15% was \navailable at the initial stage. \n \nTable A8.2: Phased Reduction of the Grants \n \nAmount of Grant Available per Solar Home \nSystem per Household \nItem \nTotal  Buy-down  Institutional \ngrant  Development Grant \nFirst 20,000 systems  $90  $70  $20 \nNext 20,000 systems  $70  $55  $15 \nNext 30,000 systems  $50  $40  $10 \nNext 88,160 systems  \u20ac38  \u20ac30  \u20ac8 \nNext 35,000 systems  \u20ac36  \u20ac30  \u20ac6 \nNext 35,000 systems  \u20ac34  \u20ac30  \u20ac4 \nSource: Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \n \n3.  Current Status of the Program \n \n8.  IDCOL had an initial target of financing 50,000 SHSs, which it achieved in August 2005, \n3 years ahead of the target date and $2 million below estimated costs. Following the success of \nIDCOL\u2019s solar program, the World Bank extended its support for financing renewable energy \nsubprojects and German development cooperation through KfW provided \u20ac16.5 million ($21.3 \nmillion) in 2005 as a grant to the Government to be used for the further financing of renewable \nenergy  subprojects.  Up  to  April  2008,  a  total  of  approximately  200,000  SHSs  have  been \ninstalled under IDCOL\u2019s solar program. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 8 \n9.  So far, IDCOL has arranged grants for 228,160 SHSs and refinancing for 225,000 SHSs \nfrom the World Bank and German development cooperation through KfW and GTZ.

Currently,  IDCOL  uses  primarily  funding  from  KfW  to finance  approximately  10,000 \nSHSs per month\u2014more than double the figure estimated at the time of appraisal by KfW. At the \npresent rate of project implementation, the KfW funds, which were originally available for the \nfinancing of a total of 100,000 SHSs, will be exhausted within 2 years (by the end of 2008) \nrather than the original target of 4 years.  \n \n11.  In terms of financial status, there has been no default or any other repayment issues on \nloans from IDCOL to the participating organizations so far. The current repayment rate of the \nloans from the participating organizations to the households is very high (approximately 96%). \n \n4.  Program Target \n \n12.  The revised target for installation of SHSs for 2008\u20132012 is shown in Table A8.4. Based \non the rapid installation of SHSs in the past 5 years, IDCOL now has an ambitious target of \ninstalling more than 928,000 SHSs by 2012.  \n \nTable A8.4: Installation Targets for Solar Home System, 2008\u20132012 \n \nUp to \nItem  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012 \nInstallation    102,000  126,000  156,000  180,000  198,000 \nInstallation (cumulative)  166,624  268,624  394,624  550,624  730,624  928,624 \nEquivalent MW \n8.3  13.4  19.7  27.5  36.5  46.4 \n(cumulative) \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \n \n13.

The rest will be extended to \nthe other renewable energy programs, including biomass and biogas power plants.  ", "Appendix 8  53 \n \n5.  Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes and Results \n \n14.  During implementation, all participating organizations will prepare a monthly program of \nSHS installation and submit them to IDCOL. As installation proceeds, the information will be \nrecorded and stored in a database and IDCOL will prepare consolidated periodic progress \nreports based on the reports. During the follow-up phase, IDCOL will prepare an annual report \non the number of SHSs that are operational based on a 100% survey of all the households \ncarried out by the participating organizations. The participating organizations will also submit to \nIDCOL a monthly report of the installment payments made to the participating organizations by \nthe households which have bought the SHS on credit. All data will be collected and kept for the \ncrediting period plus 2 years. \n \n6.  Development Impact of the Program \n \n15.  SHSs are a convenient way to supply power for small electrical loads such as lights, \nradio and cassette players, and black and white television sets. Although available for a limited \nnumber of hours in a day, the supply is reliable and the system can be managed with a little \ntraining. The program has also brought positive changes to the economy of the rural people, as \nthey are now using SHSs for their income-generating activities, e.g., working hours have been \nincreased for small-business operators, weavers, tailors, hairdressers, and handicraft makers. \nStudents are also getting benefits through extended hours of study at night. In addition, the use \nof television and radio has enhanced rural people\u2019s access to the wider world. Many women \nstated that they were feeling more secure at night after the installation of an SHS. \n \n16.  Furthermore, IDCOL estimates that each SHS saves at least $61.80 worth of kerosene \nevery year and reduces carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by 375 kilograms (kg) annually as a \n2\nresult. Therefore, the installation of estimated 98,000 SHSs through ADB funding will save more \nthan $6 million and reduce approximately 36,750 tons of CO  emissions annually over the 20-\n2\nyear life of the SHSs.  \n  \n7.  Job Creation in Participating Organizations\u2019 Subproject Areas \n \n17.  A significant number of job opportunities, both for skilled and unskilled labor, have been \ncreated. In particular, each unit office hires a local youth who has good knowledge of the area. It \nhas paved the way for creating job opportunities locally. In addition, a significant number of \ndiploma engineers have been employed by participating organizations to look after the technical \naspects of SHSs. IDCOL estimates that around 1,500 new jobs have been created by the \nprogram. \n \n8.  Promotion of Indigenous Technology \n \n18.  An SHS system includes a photovoltaic module, battery, charge controller, solar lamp, \nand switch. Except for the photovoltaic module, all other components are produced locally. For \nexample, Rahimafrooz, a local battery supplier, has doubled its capacity to meet the demand for \nSHS.  Charge  controller  and  solar  lamp  manufacturers  provide  poor  women  with  a  job \nopportunity.  IDCOL  is  also  trying  to  establish  a  1\u20132  MW  solar  panel  assembly  plant  in \nBangladesh through private sector participation in order to reduce the cost of the photovoltaic \nmodule. \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 8 \n9.  Environmental Issues and Safeguard Policies \n \n19.  SHSs have a variety of positive social impacts enabling the users to access radio and \ntelevision signals, and students and others to work in a safer and more pleasant environment. \nThey will also be environmentally beneficial as the use of fossil fuel will be reduced. The only \npotential  environmental  hazard  may  arise  from  improper  disposal  of  lead-acid  storage \nbatteries used in SHSs. Participating organizations have agents all over Bangladesh and they \nare already assisting SHS owners in the operation and maintenance of their systems, which \nincludes  the  safe  disposal  of  batteries.  These  arrangements  are  an  integral  part  of \nparticipating organization operations and will continue. No negative environmental impacts are \ntherefore expected. \n \nB.  Biomass-Based Power Plant Project \n \n20.  IDCOL has financed a 250 kilowatt biomass-based power plant at Kapasia, Gazipur. \nIDCOL has provided concessional loans and grants to Dreams Power Private Limited, the \nsubproject sponsor, for setting up the plant. The total cost of the subproject was Tk25 million, \nand the plant uses locally available agricultural residues, i.e., rice husks, as fuel for power \ngeneration. Ankur Scientific Energy Technologies Bangladesh is the equipment supplier of the \nsubproject. Being located in an unelectrified area, the plant supplies environmentally friendly \ngrid quality power to 300 households and commercial entities in the area. The plant started \ncommercial operation in December 2007.  \n \n21.  IDCOL intends to finance 15 additional biomass gasification-based power plants in the \nnext few years. It is envisaged that $4.3 million of the ADF loan will be extended in order to \nfinance up to 50% of each subproject cost. These 15 plants will produce 7.5 MW in total. \nAccording to IDCOL\u2019s assessment, however, a portion of subproject cost has to be financed as \na grant to make these plants financially viable.  \n \nC.  Biogas-Based Electricity Plant Subproject2 \n \n22.  IDCOL also plans to finance biogas-based electricity plants3 on a pilot basis. While a few \nbiogas-based electricity plants have already been installed in Bangladesh, a technical challenge \nremains to remove impurities from the biogas before it enters into the generator. After assessing \nthe technical and financial feasibility through the pilot subproject, IDCOL intends to finance \naround 100 biogas plants through participating organizations. It is envisaged that $1.8 million \nwill be extended to this subproject from the ADF loan, and will result in 5.0 MW generation \ncapacity in total.  \n  \n                                                 \n2  IDCOL has been undertaking the national domestic biogas and manure program under Netherlands Development \nOrganization (SNV) and KfW assistance since 2006. Under the program, 2,200 biogas plants had been installed by \nthe end of 2007. These biogas plants produce gas and slurry but do not generate electricity, and these plants \ntherefore mainly serve cooking purposes (gas) and agricultural production (slurry as good organic fertilizer). In the \nnew project, IDCOL intends to introduce biogas-based electricity plants.   \n3  The major difference between biomass gasification and biogas technologies are the source of the biomass energy \nand the way they produce gas. Gasification technologies make biogas by heating wood chips or other vegetable \nbiomass in an oxygen-starved environment. Biogas technologies take advantage of the natural fermentation of \nhuman and animal excreta and other garbage that produces methane gas.  ", "Appendix 9  55 \nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguards  framework  (ESSF)  comprises  the \nenvironmental management system (EMS) and the social safeguards framework (SSF). The \nprovisions  for  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and  the  assessment  and  mitigation \nmeasures contained in the EMS and SSF are applicable for all components and subprojects \nfinanced through the resources from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by the Infrastructure \nDevelopment Company Limited (IDCOL), through direct lending and refinance operations to \nboth public and private sector companies.   \n2.  Given the structure of components under the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development \nFacility (PPIDF), the ESSF will apply at the Project level for components A and B and for biogas \nand biomass power plants financed under component C. For solar energy subprojects financed \nunder component C, the ESSF will apply at the program level. The ESSF is not limited to \nIDCOL; all lead banks and sponsors interested in seeking financial assistance from IDCOL, \nwhere financing from ADB is used, will need to conduct business in a manner such that IDCOL \ncan be compliant with this ESSF. \n3.  The ESSF builds upon the environmental and social appraisal manual that was prepared \nin 2000 by a team of external consultants in response to the requirements of the World Bank in \nprocessing the Private Sector Infrastructure Fund. Importantly, the ESSF incorporates updates \non  environmental  and  social  governance  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s safeguard policies,1 i.e., the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and the Environment Policy (2002). \nB.  Overview and Structure of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework \n \n4.  IDCOL\u2019s ESSF has been structured to reflect the following: \n \n(i)  environmental and social policies, \n(ii)  operational  steps  on  environmental  and  social  procedures  as  practiced  in \nsubproject processing and in the subproject life cycle,  \n(iii)  guidance and checklists,  \n(iv)  institutional structure to operate the ESSF,  \n(v)  capacity development plan at IDCOL,  \n(vi)  allocation of responsibilities, \n(vii)  annual environmental and social reporting, and \n(viii)  updating of the ESSF.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Safeguard policies are generally understood to be those operational policies that seek to avoid, minimize, or \nmitigate adverse environmental and social impacts, including the protection of the rights of those affected or likely \nto be marginalized by the development process. There is no formal definition of ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \nHowever, the three policies mentioned here are identified as safeguard policies in ADB. 2003. Review of the \nInspection Function: Establishment of a New ADB Accountability Mechanism. Manila (page 60). \n ", "56  Appendix 9 \n1.  Environmental and Social Policy Statement of IDCOL\u2019s Environmental and \nSocial Safeguards Framework \n \n5.  IDCOL gives due importance to environmental and social considerations in appraising \nand financing infrastructure subprojects in order to minimize adverse impacts and risks to the \nenvironment and people that may be affected.  \n \n6.  IDCOL is committed to comply with all relevant environmental and social policy and \nlegislative requirements and laws of the lands with which it engages and remain responsive to \nthe environmental and social requirements of ADB. \n \n2.  Environmental Management System Framework \n \n7.  The EMS framework defines policy procedures, roles, and responsibilities for managing \nadverse environmental impacts and risks due to subprojects that are financed by IDCOL. The \nEMS has been prepared as part of IDCOL\u2019s commitment to comply with the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental policies, laws, and regulations, and ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policy. \n \n8.  The objectives of the EMS are to \n \n(i)  avoid and minimize adverse environmental impacts and risks due to subprojects \nthat  will  receive  finance  from  IDCOL,  especially  in  environmentally  sensitive \nareas; \n(ii)  ensure  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  risks  are  well  mitigated  to \nachieve applicable environmental standards; \n(iii)  comply  with  applicable  Government  laws  and  regulations  and  environmental \nsafeguards requirements of development partners; and  \n(iv)  provide  guidance  to  lead  banks  and  sponsors  in  preparing  subprojects  for \nappraisal at IDCOL and in conducting subsequent monitoring and reporting, and \nin undertaking corrective actions. \n9.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  shows  a  comparative  assessment  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental impact assessment (EIA) framework and the environmental and \nsocial safeguards (ESS) of ADB. This comparison shows that the Government\u2019s EIA framework \nhas significant weaknesses and deviations from the ESS of ADB. The areas of differences are \nschemes  of  subproject  categorization,  scoping,  alternatives,  and  requirements  of  public \nconsultation and disclosure.  \n \n3.  Social Safeguards Framework \n \n10.  The  SSF  defines  and  outlines  policies,  procedures,  roles,  and  responsibilities  for \nmanaging  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  risks,  and  effects  on  adivasi2 peoples  of \nsubprojects that are financed by IDCOL. The SSF is part of the commitment of IDCOL to comply \nwith the Government\u2019s social policies, laws, and regulations, and to comply with ADB\u2019s social \nsafeguard policies. \n \n                                                 \n2  Groups referred to by international organizations as indigenous peoples can be referred to in Bangladesh as ethnic \nminorities or adivasi(s). Adivasi is the term employed in the draft national policy on involuntary resettlement.  ", "Appendix 9  57 \n11.  A key objective of the SSF is to provide guidance to subproject sponsors in preparing \nsubprojects for appraisal for the PPIDF and in conducting subsequent monitoring, and reporting, \nand in undertaking corrective actions. As the facility will make investments in companies with \nsignificant operations in Bangladeshi infrastructure, in some circumstances such development \nor  expansion  may  cause  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  on  people.  In  these  and  other \ncircumstances,  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  adivasis  may  also  be  affected.  In  such  cases, \nrelevant Government legislation and policies would apply, as would either or both of ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples policies (as reflected in this framework).3 \n \n12.  Other key objectives for this SSF are to ensure that subproject-affected people benefit \nfrom the proposed subprojects to the extent possible and that they are consulted about the \nsubproject throughout the life of the subproject. IDCOL will ensure that involuntary resettlement \nimpacts of any subproject submitted for financing under the facility are dealt with in accordance \nwith the applicable Government and regional laws and regulations governing land acquisition, \ncompensation,  relocation,  and  resettlement,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \ninvoluntary resettlement.   \n \n13.  Objectives for managing involuntary resettlement impacts and risks are to  \n \n(i)  avoid involuntary resettlement wherever feasible, \n(ii)  minimize resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable, and \n(iii)  ensure that affected people receive assistance so that they will be at least as well \noff as they would have been in the absence of the subproject.  \n \n14.  Objectives for managing subproject impacts on adivasis are to \n(i)  achieve the greatest possible reduction of poverty and vulnerability among the \naffected adivasi populations; \n(ii)  minimize negative impacts, if they are unavoidable; \n(iii)  ensure transparency and accountability of any mechanism applied as part of \nsubproject intervention; \n(iv)  deliver culturally appropriate programs and benefits, and \n(v)  ensure meaningful consultations take place regarding the scope and delivery of \ncompensatory mechanisms and benefits. \n15.  Supplementary Appendix H shows a comparison of the Government\u2019s social safeguards \napproach as it relates to involuntary resettlement and indigenous people issues from that of \nADB. For the indigenous people (adivasi) issues, a significant difference is the lack of national \ncoverage  in  the  Government  legislation  along  with  differences  in  terms  of  consultation \nrequirements. For involuntary resettlement, the areas of difference include payment of market \nversus replacement cost for lost land and assets, as well as in eligibility and entitlement.  \nC.  Integrated Application of Environmental Management System and Social \nSafeguards Framework for the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility \n                                                 \n3  There are some significant differences between the Government\u2019s involuntary resettlement policies (i.e., land \nacquisition policies) and those of ADB, particularly the latter\u2019s emphases on (i) utilizing the principle of replacement \nprice over market price, (ii) livelihood restoration, and (iii) recognizing nontitled persons\u2019 rights to compensation. \nSimilarly, the Government adivasi framework does not include all such populations in the country and does not \ninclude requirements for development plans for projects affecting adivasis. \n ", "58  Appendix 9 \n16.  Considering the components under the PPIDF, the ESSF is structured on subproject and \nprogram levels. Since various subprojects that will be financed under components A and B \ncould have potential environmental and social issues, the ESSF will operate at the subproject \nlevel. On the other hand, the subprojects supported under component C (with the exception of \nbiogas and biomass power plants) will not have significant environmental and social impacts at \nthe subproject level. On the program level, however, there could be environmental and social \nimpacts that may need to be attended to. Hence, the ESSF will operate at the program level for \ncomponent C. \n1.  Subproject Processing Steps at IDCOL for Components A and B \n17.  There  will  be  two  possibilities  for  the  application  of  the  ESSF  for  IDCOL\u2019s  PPIDF \ndepending on the timing of the subproject loan application. \n18.  Case  A.  The  first  case  applies  to  all  subprojects  that  have  already  received  the \npreliminary letter of support from IDCOL but have not yet received final loan approval by \nIDCOL\u2019s board of directors at the time of ADB loan effectiveness. This case will be transitional. \nFor such subprojects, the process will essentially be of due diligence and will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Categorize  the  subprojects  as  to  whether  it  warrants  initial  environment \nexamination or EIA, or the equivalent of a full or short resettlement plan and/or a \nfull or short adivasi development plan (ADP).  \n \n(ii)  Identify gaps, if any, in environmental and social compliance. If there are no \ngaps,  then  review  all  relevant  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs), \nresettlement  plans,  and/or  ADP  reports  and  plans.  If  such  reports  are  not \navailable, then prepare internal environmental and social appraisal reports using \nresources at IDCOL\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguards Management Unit \n(ESSMU) and/or external expert(s) as appropriate. For category A subprojects or \nfor  equivalent  of  full  resettlement  and/or  full  ADPs,  include  field  visit  of \nenvironmental and social safeguards specialist. \n \n(iii)  If there are gaps on environmental or social compliance, or in the proposed \nEMPs, resettlement action plans or ADP (in terms of coverage, adequacy, and \ncosting) then direct the lead bank and/or sponsors to carry out time-targeted \nactions  to  attain  compliance  and  strengthen  provisions  made  for  EMP, \nresettlement action plans, and ADP appropriately.  \n \n(iv)  In cases where the lead bank and/or sponsor approaches IDCOL with all land \nand preparatory physical assets acquisitions already having been completed, \nIDCOL will initiate a process of due diligence to assess the circumstances and \nnature of such acquisitions.  \n \n(v)  Due diligence aims to \n(a)  identify  any  outstanding  issues  regarding  land  and  livelihood  assets \npurchased; \n(b)  identify any outstanding adivasi issues regarding subproject plan, design, \nand  implementation,  particularly  the  proportionate  inclusion  of  adivasi \npopulations in subproject benefits or opportunities; \n(c)  confirm that the laws and regulations of the Government were followed; \n(d)  determine specific involuntary resettlement issues such as:  ", "Appendix 9  59 \n(i)  Is there any ongoing encroachment on subproject lands?  \n(ii)  Were people excluded from compensation on the grounds of being \nillegal squatters on the land purchased? \n(iii)  Was  all  compensation  paid  as  promised?  Was  it  according  to \nreplacement value? Are there any outstanding claims? \n(iv)  Was  the  area  claimed  and/or  purchased  the  same  as  the  area \nactually taken by the subproject?  \n \n(vi)  Due diligence is pursued through the following measures: \n(a)  By  using  a  social  assessment  (commissioned  by  the  sponsor  and \nproportionate in scope to the significance of social impact) to identify \ngaps, if any, in social compliance as per this SSF.  \n(b)  By IDCOL reviewing the social assessment report issued. \n(c)  If  there  are  no  gaps,  then  IDCOL  will  review  all  relevant  involuntary \nresettlement and/or adivasi-related reports or plans. For equivalent of full \nresettlement plans and/or full ADPs, include field visit of the ESSMU \nsocial safeguards specialist (social safeguards liaison officer) to confirm \nthe social appraisal report. \n(d)  If there are gaps on social compliance, by directing subproject sponsors \nto carry out time-targeted actions to attain compliance, documented in a \nwritten action plan. \n(e)  By setting loan conditionality (in loan sanction letter and elsewhere, as \nnecessary)  to  include  these  commitments  in  social  (resettlement  and \nadivasi) safeguard covenants. \n \n(vii)  Reissue  revised  indicative  term  sheet  (as  necessary)  to  include  these \nrequirements  towards  environmental  and  social  (resettlement  and  adivasi) \ncompliance. \n \n(viii)  On obtaining concurrence from the lead bank and/or sponsor, follow steps as per \n(v) of case B.  \n19.  Case  B.  The  second  case  applies  to  all  subprojects  that  have  not  yet  received  a \npreliminary letter of support by IDCOL at the time of ADB loan effectiveness. This case will \nrepresent the situation of normal subproject processing and monitoring. The procedural steps \nfor this case are as follows. \n \n(i)  Brief the lead bank and/or sponsor on the ESSF during the \u201cknow your client\u201d \nmeeting. Explain the environmental and social requirements in the completion of \nthe loan application form.4  \n \n(ii)  In preparing loan applications, it is strongly advised that the subproject sponsor \nbe familiar with the environmental and social requirements of the Government. \nThe lead bank and/or sponsor will provide IDCOL with a preliminary description \nof the subproject configuration, including the location of the subproject, the land \nrequirements and how it was obtained, the types of people at the subproject site \n                                                 \n4  Presently, IDCOL\u2019s loan application form does not ask for basic environmental and social information. Recently, \nunder  the  World  Bank-supported  Investment  Promotion  and  Financing  Facility,  the  Bangladesh  Bank  has \nintroduced a section on environmental compliance. Under this ESSF, IDCOL will include a similar section in its loan \napplication form.  \n ", "60  Appendix 9 \n(including the presence or absence of adivasis), and a brief assessment of the \nsocial conditions at the subproject location. Similarly, brief information will need \nto be provided on the environmental setting of the location (any sensitive flora, \nfauna, water bodies, or populations), information on raw materials, products, \noutputs and fuel proposed to be used, and plans on management of wastes \nand/or emissions. \n \n(iii)  Prepare environmental and social section of the preliminary subproject appraisal \nbased on completed loan application form from the lead bank and/or sponsor. \nThis section will conduct environmental categorization5 and preliminary screening \nof  proposed  subprojects  to  identify  key  environmental  issues,  resettlement \neffects, and impacts on adivasis.  \n \n(iv)  If the preliminary subproject appraisal determines that significant environmental \nissues that are irreversible and cannot be mitigated exist, or if it is found that \nthere are highly significant involuntary resettlement effects or likely significant \nnegative  effects  on  adivasis,  then  financing  of  the  subproject  will  not  be \nrecommended.   \n \n(v)  If it is found that the environmental and social issues can be well addressed \nthrough appropriate prevention and mitigation measures, then a preliminary letter \nof support will be recommended with an indicative term sheet that will state \nvarious environmental and social requirements and conditions. Inform ADB and \nprovide it with all the key documents that are prepared for the issuance of the \npreliminary letter of support. \n \n(vi)  For component A and B subprojects, submission of the EMP, resettlement action \nplan and ADP documents for ADB\u2019s approval will be mandatory for subprojects \nfinanced  after  ADB  loan  effectiveness.  After  receiving  approval,  IDCOL  will \ncontinue to be responsible for due diligence adherence to the guidelines of this \nESSF. \n \n(vii)  These requirements will include submission of a short environmental assessment \nreport (SEAR) and a short social assessment report (SSAR). These reports will \nneed to be prepared by the lead bank and/or sponsor in accordance with this \nESSF.  \n \n(viii)  In cases where the lead bank and/or sponsor approaches IDCOL with all land \nand preparatory physical assets acquisitions already having been completed, \nIDCOL will initiate a due diligence process to assess the circumstances and \nnature of such acquisitions, as set out earlier.  \n \n(ix)  The SSAR is a technical report prepared at the instruction of the lenders and on \nbehalf of the subproject sponsor or lead bank. The SSAR will report the results of \nthe social assessment, focusing on the likely involuntary resettlement effects and \n                                                 \n5  Categorization will be done based on both the Government and ADB environmental safeguard systems. The \nGovernment follows categories like green, orange-1, orange-2, and red whereas equivalent categories of ADB are \nC, B, and A, with A corresponding to the red category of the Government. In the case of differences, the most \nsensitive category of the two will take precedence. ", "Appendix 9  61 \nimpacts on adivasis of the proposed subproject. The SSAR will be based on \nquantitative and qualitative subproject-site investigations by a qualified social \nscience professional. The extent of the SSAR should be proportionate to the \nexpected involuntary resettlement and adivasis impacts, as indicated by the initial \nscreening for the preliminary subproject appraisal.   \n \n(x)  The  SEAR  will  include  a  draft  EMP  covering  site  preparation,  construction, \noperation, and closure cycles of the subproject, drawn in response to issues \nidentified  and  towards  meeting  compliance  requirements  of  various \nenvironmental regulations of the Government. The EMP may be accompanied by \na  disaster  management  plan  as  appropriate.  The  EMP  and/or  disaster \nmanagement  plan  should  reflect  good  or  environmentally  sound  practices, \nespecially in the choice of technology, equipment, and materials and fuel.  \n \n(xi)  Once the preliminary letter of support is issued, IDCOL's interest in financing the \nsubproject is to be posted on its website with a short subproject description and \nwith  a  provision  to  receive  feedback  over  60  days  for  subprojects  under \ncomponent  A  and  30  days  for  subprojects  under  component  B  (sensitive \nsubprojects). \n \n(xii)  Review  the  SEAR,  reaffirm  the  subproject  categorization  (category  A),  and \ndetermine  the  adequacy,  coverage,  and  effectiveness  of  the  outline  EMP \nsubmitted. Recommend the terms of reference for the conduct of the EIA on this \nbasis if the same is not yet completed or commenced.  \n \n(xiii)  Based on the SSAR, assess the magnitude of involuntary resettlement impacts \nand  determine  whether  a  short  or  full  resettlement  plan  is  required  for  the \nsubproject.  A  full  resettlement  plan  will  be  required  where  resettlement  is \nsignificant. Involuntary resettlement is deemed significant when 200 or more \npeople will experience major impacts, which are defined as being physically \ndisplaced  from  housing  or  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  (income-\ngenerating) assets. \n \n(xiv)  Similarly, with regard to impacts on adivasis, a determination will be made as to \nthe significance of impacts and whether a short or full ADP is required. The \nimpacts of subprojects on adivasis will be considered significant if the impacts \npositively or negatively (a) affect their customary rights of use and access to land \nand natural resources; (b) change their socioeconomic status; (c) affect their \ncultural and communal integrity; (d) affect their health, education, livelihood, and \nsocial security status; or (e) alter or undermine the recognition of indigenous \nknowledge. \n \n(xv)  Prepare  environmental  and  social  section  of  the  subproject  appraisal  report. \nReview all documents required towards environmental and social compliance as \nper checklists and review adequacy, coverage, and costing of the EMP and \nresettlement action plan (short or full).   \n \n(xvi)  Involve  external  expert  as  required,  especially  if  complete  or  up-to-date \ndocumentation is not available at this stage. For subprojects financed under \ncomponent A or for equivalent of full resettlement plans and/or full ADPs, include \nfield visit of ESSMU staff and the external expert.  \n ", "62  Appendix 9 \n \n(xvii)  Develop section on environmental and social aspects of the common term sheet \nbased on the outcomes of the appraisal.  \n \n(xviii)  Recommend to the credit committee and to IDCOL board to include conditions \nfor environmental and social compliance in the loan sanction letter and loan \nagreement.  \n \n(xix)  In the case of environment category B (sensitive) or category A subprojects, the \nsummary initial environment examination or the summary EIA is made available \nto the public 120 days before a disbursement request is submitted to ADB and is \nposted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n(xx)  Obtain ADB\u2019s approval for the entire category A subproject prior to the issue of \nloan sanction letter. \n \n(xxi)  Monitor whether the conditions have been met, especially on approvals (such as \nenvironmental  clearance  certificate)  and  whether  satisfactory  and  full \nimplementation  of  the  EMP,  resettlement  action  plan  and  ADP  has  been \nachieved. Subproject sponsors should make environmental and social monitoring \nreports available to affected people. All monitoring reports should be sent to ADB \nand disclosed publicly to affected stakeholders. \n \n(xxii)  Continue monitoring progress on the subproject through reports received from \nthe lead bank and/or sponsor. Conduct field visits if required by sending the staff \nof ESSMU. Conduct third-party monitoring in the case of subprojects financed \nunder component A and in case of subprojects under component B where there \nare instances of repeated noncompliance. Recommend direct adaptations in the \nEMP, resettlement action plan and ADP as needed.  \n \n(xxiii)  For third-party monitoring to add value and not serve as an imposition, IDCOL \nmay consider offering annual service of rapid energy efficiency audits to power-\ngenerating  subprojects.  These  energy  efficiency  audits  will  include  emission \nmonitoring and thus provide status on both energy efficiency and environmental \ncompliance. Fees to third parties for such rapid energy efficiency audits may be \nsupported from the budget under ADB\u2019s technical assistance.     \n20.  The steps as outlined for case B, i.e., normal subproject processing and monitoring, will \nthus bring the ESSF into the mainstream of the PPIDF.   \n2.  Application of the Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework for \nComponent C of the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility \n21.  Component C will support IDCOL\u2019s already successful renewable energy program which \nfinances solar home systems and biomass-based installations in rural areas.  \n22.  Financing of SHSs does not entail significant environmental and social impacts at the \nlevel of an installation or a system. No involuntary resettlement and rehabilitation issues are \nexpected under this component (with the exception of biogas and biomass power plants) as \nland acquisition is not involved.  ", "Appendix 9  63 \n23.  The package under the renewable energy system (RES) will involve provision of lead \nacetate  batteries  and  compact  fluorescent  lamps.  Since  thousands  of  such  packages  are \nexpected to be financed and implemented, disposal of used lead acetate batteries and compact \nfluorescent lamps needs to be looked into. \n24.  IDCOL has already formulated a lead acetate batteries recycling policy and operational \nguidelines. This system will be followed and improved under this ESSF.  \n25.  Based on the principles laid down under this ESSF, IDCOL should make efforts to use \nlong-life  lead  acetate  batteries  and  low-mercury  compact  fluorescent  lamps  to  the  extent \npossible. IDCOL may in addition explore the setting up of compact fluorescent lamp recycling \nplants at strategic locations in partnership with agencies such as GTZ and Waste Concern.  \n26.  IDCOL has a comprehensive monitoring system for the RES that has tiers of inspectors, \nIDCOL officers, and independent assessors.  \nD.  Environmental and Social Safeguards Management Unit  \n27.  IDCOL is managed by an eight-member independent board of directors and has a small \nand multiskilled workforce comprising economists, financial and market analysts, engineers, \nlawyers, information technology experts, and accountants. IDCOL's stakeholders include the \nGovernment, private sector, nongovernment organizations, multilateral institutions, academics, \nand the general population.   \n28.  IDCOL has some resident staff with experience in reviewing environmental and social \naspects  but  does  not  have  trained  environmental  and  social  experts  or  a  dedicated \nenvironmental and social management unit. Considering the scope of the PPIDF, it is proposed \nthat IDCOL sets up an ESSMU.  \n29.  The  ESSMU  will  have  two  full-time  staff  as  safeguard  liaison  officers.  These  staff \nmembers  will  oversee  and  coordinate  internal  reviewing  and  approvals  processes.  The \nenvironmental  specialist  will  have  a  master's  degree  in  environmental  science  and/or \nengineering and/or planning with at least 10 years of experience in conducting and reviewing \nenvironmental and social assessments. Familiarity with government regulations and procedures \nwill be essential and exposure to ESSs at ADB will be desirable. The social assessment \nspecialist will have a master's degree in social development and allied areas with at least 5 \nyears of experience in the preparation of resettlement actions plans and ADPs. \n \n30.  The  ESSMU  staff  will  receive  training  in  (i)  screening  prospective  subprojects  for \nenvironmental issues, involuntary resettlement, and effects on adivasis; (ii) resettlement plan \nand ADP preparation and appraisal; (iii) plan monitoring; and (iv) reporting. The ESSMU initially \nwill have consultants to assist it in reviewing subproject proposals. It could also contract with an \nexternal agency to carry out the social safeguard assessment, guidance, appraisal, monitoring, \nand reporting functions for which IDCOL will be responsible. Selection of the external agency \nwill be to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \n \n31.  To assist in the detailed review during subproject appraisals, the ESSMU will draw on \nadditional specialists as necessary under a contract. These specialists may be drawn from a \npanel and be on a subproject-by-subproject basis. This panel may consist of experts that have \nfamiliarity with sectors like energy and infrastructure, with some exposure to environmental and \nsocial issues. \n ", "64  Appendix 9 \nE.  Capacity Development Plan  \n \n32.  The  ESSMU  of  IDCOL  will  undertake  an  awareness  program  for  IDCOL\u2019s  staff  for \nfamiliarizing them with the ESSF, especially its interface with IDCOL\u2019s subproject processing \nand monitoring processes.  \n \n33.  Since the effectiveness of IDCOL\u2019s ESSF depends considerably on the understanding \nand preparedness of lead banks and sponsors, it is important that IDCOL makes efforts to \nsensitize the lead banks and/or sub-borrowers on management of environmental and social \nissues, provides guidance, and encourages them to build requisite capacities.  \n \n34.  IDCOL,  with  the  assistance  of  the  ESSMU,  will  prepare  a  short  brochure  on \ncommunicating in particular the benefits, process, and requirements of the ESSF. It will also \nmake efforts to offer lead banks and sponsors short programs (0.5\u20131 day) to explain IDCOL\u2019s \nESSF. These efforts may encourage lead banks and/or sponsors in particular to consider \nadopting the proposed ESSF.  \nF.  Allocation of Responsibilities  \n \n35.  Proposals to IDCOL will typically arise from lead banks and sponsors either for seeking \ndirect lending or for refinance. \n \n36.  Lead bank means a financial institution that is funding the subproject and is designated \nas such by the interinstitutional group or consortium provided the risk exposure of IDCOL is less \nthan that of the lead bank in a subproject.  \n37.  The lead banks and sponsors will be expected to provide IDCOL with all the required \ndocumentation (EIA report, environmental clearance certificate, resettlement action plan, ADP, \netc.) in line with the requirements of IDCOL\u2019s ESSF.  \n38.  Similarly, the lead banks and sponsors will be responsible for regular monitoring and \nperiodic evaluation of compliance of the subproject with agreed milestones and performance \nlevels,  particularly  for  purposes  of  disbursement  of  IDCOL  funds.  The  lead  banks  and/or \nsponsors  will  send  periodic  progress  reports  in  such  form  and  at  such  times  as  may  be \nprescribed by IDCOL. The lead banks and sponsors will therefore be responsible for reporting \nenvironmental and social compliance of the subproject to IDCOL in the formats as prescribed by \nthe ESSF.  \n \n39.  The  responsibility  for  complying  with  safeguards  policy  requirements  lies  with  each \nsponsor. However, the ESSMU will make sure such compliance is achieved by the sponsor \nprior to the disbursement of the loan. \n \n40.  The  sponsor  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  preparing,  financing,  disclosing,  and \nimplementing an EMP, a resettlement action plan (including land acquisition and the payment of \ncompensation), and/or an ADP in accordance with this ESSF and the applicable policies, laws, \nand regulations. Sponsors will engage the requisite environmental and social scientific expertise \nin  environmental  protection  and  conservation,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  adivasi \ndevelopment  matters  to  help  carry  out  the  necessary  studies,  analyses,  and  document \npreparation.  Such  experts  will  also  need  to  oversee  sponsor  implementation  of  any  plans \ndeveloped. Qualifications should include familiarity with devising (i) EMPs and resettlement ", "Appendix 9  65 \nplans according to both national and international standards, and (ii) ADPs with the cultures and \nsocial structure of adivasi groups. \n \n41.  The  sponsor  will  be  responsible  for  regular  monitoring  and  periodic  evaluation  of \ncompliance of the subproject with agreed milestones and performance levels, particularly for \npurposes of disbursement of IDCOL funds. It will send periodic progress reports in such form \nand at such times as may be prescribed by IDCOL. The lead banks and/or sponsors will \ntherefore be responsible for reporting EMP, resettlement plan, and/or ADP compliance of the \nsubproject to IDCOL in the formats as prescribed by the plans. \nG.  Annual Environmental and Social Reporting and Disclosure  \n \n42.  IDCOL will prepare annual environmental and social reports through the ESSMU.  \n \n43.  The annual report will be developed by the ESSMU and will be submitted to the IDCOL \nboard along with corrective actions, if any. After the board\u2019s approval, this report will be included \nin the annual report of IDCOL. A soft copy of this report will be kept on IDCOL\u2019s website.  \n \n44.  Apart  from  annual  environmental  and  social  reporting,  IDCOL  will  need  to  prepare \nreports, from time to time, as required by ADB which will contain, for instance, reporting on \nenvironmental  and  social  performance  of  past  subprojects  and  corrective  action  plans.  In \naddition,  management  of  environmental  and  social  issues  of  proposed  subprojects  where \npreliminary letters of support have been issued will need to be reported.   \n \n45.  Information Disclosure. IDCOL will work with the subproject sponsor to ensure that \nrelevant  information  (whether  positive  or  negative)  on  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nissues  is  made  available,  in  a  form,  manner,  and  language(s)  accessible  to  the  affected \ncommunities and accessible to other key stakeholders, including the general public, for them to \nprovide  meaningful  inputs  into  subproject  design  and  implementation.  IDCOL  will  disclose \n(including by posting on its website) the following safeguard documents:  \n \n(i)  For each proposed subproject (other than those expected to have minimal or no \nadverse impacts), a draft environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement \nplan, and indigenous people plan before loan approval.  \n(ii)  Environmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people  monitoring \nreports submitted by subproject sponsors during subproject implementation. \n \nH.  Updating the Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework \n \n46.  IDCOL\u2019s ESSF will be maintained on its website on a dedicated page for the purposes of \nsharing and for receiving any comments or suggestions. \n \n47.  The  ESSF  will  be  reviewed  each  year,  especially  after  the  results  of  annual \nenvironmental and social audits. Based on the experience gained, and considering further \nchanges, if any, in the Government\u2019s environmental policy and regulatory framework or in the \nESS  of  ADB,  the  ESSF  document  will  be  appropriately  updated.  This  task  will  be  the \nresponsibility of IDCOL\u2019s ESSMU. \n    \n \n ", "66  Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Bangladesh: Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF) \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  South Asia Department  \nSovereign Loan \nModality:  Division:  Governance, Finance and Trade Division \n       \n \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \n \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nThe Project supports both the Government\u2019s and the Asian Development Bank's (ADB)\u2019s development goals for \nBangladesh in the area of poverty reduction. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues. Infrastructure development and economic growth are strongly linked. Greater provision of \ninfrastructure and related services has a particularly beneficial impact on the poor by, for instance, improving \naccess to markets and areas with greater economic and employment opportunities. For the poor, in particular, \nimproved water supply and sanitation, rural electrification, and better community and subdistrict infrastructure can \nhave  tremendous  beneficial  impacts.  Bangladesh\u2019s  poor  investment  climate  and  major  deficiencies  in \ninfrastructure provision have been identified as key constraints to growth. Due to lack of adequate investment for \nmaintenance, the quality of existing infrastructure has worsened over the last 10 years.  \n \nBangladesh continues to rank among those countries most requiring improvement in infrastructure services. \nIncreasing access to infrastructure services and improving their quality will be important factors in reducing poverty \nlevels. Infrastructure services are critical to reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals in \nBangladesh. Erratic public sector services have imposed significant costs and hindered the growth of the country\u2019s \neconomy. Power shortages reduce industrial output by an estimated $1 billion per year and gross domestic \nproduct growth by 0.5% per year. Congestion in the nation\u2019s ports costs the country in forgone exports and \nimpedes the ability of entrepreneurs to access imported inputs rapidly. Improving the country\u2019s transport system, \nalong with other actions, is essential to reducing product delivery times. Similar observations hold true for all the \nother infrastructure subsectors in the country, especially for energy where only 22% of rural households and 60% \nof urban households have an electricity connection. \n \nThe absence of local infrastructure services is most critically felt by the poor who are acutely aware of the effects \nof inadequate national infrastructure on their livelihoods. Shocks to the national economy, such as the rationing of \nelectricity, are particularly evident to large numbers of people dependent on employment by small enterprises in \nthe informal sector. While indirect benefits are harder for poor people to perceive, it is clear that the development \nand maintenance of national infrastructure is essential if Bangladesh is to secure the potential gains from \nglobalization.  Improving  availability  at  the  local  level  alone  is  unlikely  to  transform  the  economy,  and \ndevelopmental benefits  will not be fully realized unless simultaneous local and national improvements are \nintroduced and managed.  \n \nThe proposed intervention seeks to expand the availability of finance to the Infrastructure Development Company \nLimited (IDCOL) and simultaneously improve IDCOL\u2019s capacity in accessing market sources of finance. The \navailability of additional long-term resources will significantly assist IDCOL in fulfilling its mandate of expanding the \navailability of  high-quality  infrastructure in  Bangladesh. Further, the  proposed  assistance  will also result in \nsubprojects being priced on competitive terms, thereby reducing financing risk and reducing pricing of services to \nthe end borrower. \n \n2.    Design Features. Pro-poor\u2014the Project creates employment opportunities for unskilled urban and rural labor \nand will thus support income generation.  \n \nThe key anticipated impact on poverty will be through greater affordability of high quality infrastructure. With more \nefficient  and  lower  cost  infrastructure  subprojects  being  envisaged  through  the  PPIDF,  analysis  would  be \nnecessary to see if this translates into greater affordability and higher usage. This in turn is expected to lead to \ngreater incidence of compliance with tariffs and reduction in leakages. ", "A ppendix 1 0   67\n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nN/A \n \n \nI.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe social analysis indicates that only 22% of rural households have electricity connection while 60% of urban \nhouseholds do; 69% of enterprises in rural areas report no access to electricity at all. Of those who have electricity \nconnection, frequent power outages and surges pose significant costs to enterprises, with only 1.8% of the roughly \n3 million rural enterprises owning a generator. Poor road conditions and lack of transportation and means of \ncommunication  (only  1.5%  reported  having  access  to  fixed-line  telephone  service)  add  to  the  costs  for \nBangladesh\u2019s economy and leave the potential for growth and social development unfulfilled, especially in rural \nareas.  \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultation meetings were held with the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (the executing \nagency), IDCOL (the implementing agency), Bangladesh Bank, Ministry of Finance, and the private sector. \nFurthermore,  on-site  due  diligence  was  conducted  with  sponsors  of  large  infrastructure  subprojects  and \nparticipating organizations under IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy program. \n \n2.

Women will benefit from the Project through improved access to various infrastructure subsector \nservices and more affordable pricing of the same. The same is true for women entrepreneurs who have suffered \ndue to lack of high-quality infrastructure such as regular power supply for production units and roads for market \naccess reducing the need to walk through difficult terrain. Further, regular water supply and drainage improves \nworking conditions for women employees. Moreover, high-quality infrastructure will assist women and other \nvulnerable groups through better quality health care and education. Finally, women will benefit from subprojects \nthat conform to required environmental standards.       \n \n2.  Key Actions.

The infrastructure finance market in Bangladesh is largely characterized by inadequate \nflow of long-term funds. The Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (IDCOL) is the only \nfinancial  institution  in  Bangladesh  mandated  and  specialized  to  provide  infrastructure  debt \nfinancing, renewable energy financing, transaction advice, and training in project financing. At \npresent no other financial institution in Bangladesh can catalyze international knowledge and \nfunds for infrastructure finance. \n \n2.  The  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  $165  million  Public\u2013Private \nInfrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF) will directly support the infrastructure development \nagenda of the Government of Bangladesh by enhancing the availability of much needed long-\nterm funds for infrastructure financing. With ADB assistance through the PPIDF, IDCOL will \nprovide funds at commercial terms with up to 20 years maturity for infrastructure subprojects, \nwhich are currently not being provided by the market. PPIDF aims to attract further commercial \nfinancing, thereby reducing the pressure on the public budget for infrastructure development.  \n \n1.  Why Risk Assessment \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan specifies that project design \nshould incorporate findings of governance, and corruption risk assessments, and that project \ndocumentation should clearly identify risk and risk management measures.  Accordingly, this \nassessment  considers  the  following:  (i)  relevant  governance  issues  in  Bangladesh\u2019s \ninfrastructure  sector,  (ii)  relevant  risk  analysis  of  the  development  finance  sector,  (iii)  risk \nmitigation measures at the IDCOL level, and (iv) recommendations on how the findings of the \nassessment can be incorporated into the implementation of the PPIDF.  \n \nB.  Relevant Governance Issues and Risks \n \n4.  Bangladesh\u2019s economy is widely regarded to suffer from weak governance. Despite \ngood  progress  in  many  social  indicators,  perceived  corruption  adds  to  the  costs  of  doing \nbusiness  and  reduces  the  nation\u2019s  attractiveness  for  foreign  direct  investment.  Public \nprocurement  procedures  that  are  universally  associated  with  high  levels  of  corruption  are \naddressed in a major reform program supported by ADB, World Bank, and other development \npartners and the Parliament passed the Public Procurement Act in 2006. The Government has \nrecently demonstrated strong commitment to pursuing critical governance reforms with focus on \ncombating  corruption,  ensuring  the  effectiveness  and  independence  of  the  judiciary,  and \ndepoliticizing the civil service. It has already reconstituted the Anti-Corruption Commission, \nframed new laws to tackle corruption, taken tough legal and prosecutorial actions, and ratified \nthe United Nations Convention Against Corruption.  \n \n5.  ADB, through its  $150 million good governance program, is actively supporting the \nGovernment policy reform program to: (i) strengthen the ongoing consensus building on good \ngovernance, integrity, and anticorruption reforms and bring good governance and anticorruption \ninitiatives into the mainstream within sectoral-level agencies to enhance their effectiveness. The \nGovernment has put good governance at the center of infrastructure sector reform policies. \nVarious measures have been included in the design of PPIDF to promote good governance and \nmitigate the risk of corruption by enhancing predictability, transparency, and accountability in \n ", " 70  Appendix 11 \ndoing business. Governance and risk issues with respect to the infrastructure financing and \nmanaging of IDCOL can be considered along the following lines: (i) Corporate Governance  \n(including on regulation and supervision); (ii) Institutional and political dimensions, and (iii) \nInstitutional Capacity and weak financial management. \n \n6.  Corporate  Governance.  The Companies Act (Bangladesh), 1994, is the law which \ngoverns incorporated domestic entities in Bangladesh. It governs the creation, functioning, and \ndissolution of companies; the relationship of shareholders to a company, periodic disclosure and \naudit requirements; the functions of the registrar of joint-stock companies; and the jurisdiction of \nthe courts in relation to companies. Currently, IDCOL has an eight-member board of directors \nconsisting of four high-government officials, three leading businessmen from the private sector, \nand one executive director and chief executive officer. At present, the secretary of Economic \nRelations Department chairs the board. IDCOL\u2019s Board is vested with the power to define, \ndirect, and guide IDCOL\u2019s overall operational policy; however, its effectiveness is somewhat \nindeterminate.  \n \n7.  Potential Conflict of Interest. Another issue is conflict of interest among the directors \nwhen it comes in choosing or deciding on any contract that may benefit their own businesses or \nactivities. Asking them to desist from voting on any such decision or penalizing them with a fine \nnot exceeding Tk5,000 is not sufficient to discourage such actions.  \n \n8.  Inadequate Disclosure. Once elected to a board, the Companies Act imposes certain \nresponsibilities and rights upon directors.  Disclosure of IDCOL\u2019s performance is also an issue \nbecause the information that is required to be disclosed by a company to its shareholders and to \nmembers of the public in accordance with the law is practically the only tool shareholders and \ninvestors have to judge the performance of a company and monitor the activities of the directors \nand management. Due to various reasons, including lack of knowledge on the part of the \npersons responsible to maintain the records, shareholder apathy, lack of proper monitoring by \nthe registrar of joint-stock companies and firms, lack of quality auditing services, often the \ndisclosures are not accurate or complete. \n \n9.  Independent  Directors.  Critical  for  establishing  good  corporate  governance  is  the \ninclusion of independent directors on the board of directors. In the context of Bangladesh, \ndirectors  often  current  or  former  government  officials  or  bureaucrats  are  appointed  as \nindependent director to help the company get licenses or as payback for previous favors. When \nboards need an independent opinion they rely on employing outside consultants or advisors. \nTherefore, independent directors do not usually serve as an advocate for minority shareholders \nor as a source of new and different ideas. \n \n10.  Policy Environment. With regard to the current emphasis on private participation to \nboost infrastructure development, improved corporate governance is essential. Current laws \nand policies relating to infrastructure project financing, foreign investment, currency exchange, \nand other matters concerning the private sector still do not constitute an enabling environment. \nThe risk of policies detrimental to the infrastructure sector exists though the Government is keen \non pursuing infrastructure sector development. \n \n11.  Weak Institutional Capacity. Being a government-owned institution and working as the \nfinancing arm of the Government in promoting infrastructure projects in the country, IDCOL \nneeds  a  long-term  vision  and  operational  strategy  through  an  effective  organization.  The \ncompany\u2019s  human  resources  are  relatively  narrow  (present  staff  strength  of  only  36),  but \ncommensurate  with  the  current  level  of  operations.  The  existing  workforce  is  capable  of ", "Appendix 11   71\nhandling its current business load, but is not equipped to handle more complex activities, \nespecially those that require special skills and capacity; particularly to provide TA to large \ninfrastructure subprojects. IDCOL currently outsources most of these activities.  \n \n12.  Lack of Long-Term Debt Financing. Another constraint in IDCOL\u2019s responsibility to \nimplement infrastructure subprojects is the lack of long-term debt financing. A strong pipeline of \ninfrastructure subprojects has been identified that could be eligible for IDCOL financing. Some \nof these transactions are likely to be financed within the next 1\u20132 years. However, without a \nlong-term debt financing, financial viability will not be ensured, given their large size, long \neconomic life and payback periods involved. \n \n13.  Institutional  Dimensions  of  Development  Financial  Institutions. A recent review \ncarried out by ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department on the performance of ADB\u2019s loans to \ndevelopment finance institutions (DFIs)1 found that the success rate of ADB-supported DFI \nprojects was \u201clow.\u201d This was primarily due to a range of factors including: (i) weak ownership \nincentives; (ii) poor assessment of demand for credit; and (iii) governance issues including \ndirected lending, weak credit assessment, corruption, and inadequate monitoring.  \n \nC.  Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n  1.  Risk Mitigation at the Sectoral level \n \n14.  Policy and Regulatory Risks. Despite the current reform climate, several regulatory \nchallenges in infrastructure sectors persist, and policy, institutional, and market gaps remain. To \naddress these constraints, the Government is (i) developing legal and regulatory frameworks \nand  arrangements,  (ii)  enhancing  planning  and  coordination,  and  (iii)  ensuring  quality  of \ninfrastructure. Policy reforms have been taken across sectors to reduce risks by enhancing the \nenabling environment, providing stability to long-term cash flows, and assisting in subproject \nappraisal to facilitate financing. However, the impact of the ongoing reform in the real and \nfinancial sectors will only be realized during the medium- to long-term. Innovative responses \nconsistent with the Government\u2019s policy agenda such as PPIDF shall address the prevailing \nmarket inadequacies and to keep the infrastructure development agenda moving forward. \n \n15.  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Guidelines.  To  tap  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure the Government issued the private sector infrastructure guidelines (PSIG)2 in \nOctober 2004 to facilitate private investment in telecommunications, gas, and power sectors; \nand translate such success to other sectors. The PSIG aim to overcome the cumbersome \nprocedures in sourcing and developing potential infrastructure subprojects with private sector \nparticipation.  The  PSIG  enable  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPP);  however,  they,  lack  the \ndetails usually found in a national PPP framework. Efforts have been made to upgrade the \nexisting  PPP  guidelines  though  a  sector-wide  PPP  framework  is  yet  to  be  drafted.  Some \ninfrastructure sectors such as gas sector, power, and telecommunication have set up sector-\nspecific private sector policies.  \n \n16.  Institutional Capacity and Weak Financial Management. Insufficient capacity across \ninfrastructure sectors is widening infrastructure gaps, resulting in lower productivity, higher \ntransport and logistics costs, and reduced competitiveness. Hence, there is a need to catalyze \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Annual Evaluation Review 2005. Manila. \n2  www.boi.gov.bd/psig-bgd.pdf \n ", " 72  Appendix 11 \nfinancing for bankable infrastructure subprojects that have emerged even when the reforms are \nevolving. There are a sufficient number of infrastructure subprojects in Bangladesh that need \naccess to long-term financing for implementation. Considering such subprojects by a consortium \nof investors and lenders will ensure deepening of the subproject development and financing \nskills  in  the  country.  This  is  an  essential  element  of  the  overall  reforms  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n \n17.  Private Infrastructure Committee. The PSIG provide for a national high-profile private \ninfrastructure committee (PICOM) under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to facilitate and promote \nprivate infrastructure subprojects while the Board of Investment acts as PICOM\u2019s secretariat. \nSubprojects initiated by private sponsors or line ministries require government approval to be \nlisted as a private infrastructure subproject. Based on PICOM\u2019s analysis and recommendation, \nthe cabinet committee on economic affairs approves the subproject, following which PICOM \noversees its implementation. PICOM does not have any approval authority but can facilitate and \nmonitor private infrastructure subprojects. Thus, a sound institutional mechanism is in place. \n \n2.  Risk Mitigation Measures at IDCOL \n \n18.  Corporate Governance. IDCOL is a professionally managed company with a limited \nmandate  and  functional  responsibility.  Its  operations  are  governed  by  the  Companies  Act \n(Bangladesh),  1994,  and  the  segregation  of  policy  making,  implementation,  functional \nresponsibilities  and  the  absence  of  loan  origination  within  the  organization  point  toward  a \ncorporate  governance  structure  that  legally  incorporates  international  best  practices.  The \ncorporate  governance  structure  of  IDCOL  is  also  reviewed  by  two  domestic  credit  rating \nagencies and non-compliance could have an immediate and adverse impact on IDCOL\u2019s rating \nand ultimately on its funding program.  IDCOL governance requires directors elected to the \nboard to disclose interest in any contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the \ncompany and to desist from voting on any such decision.  \n \n19.  Policy Commitment to IDCOL. Since 2005, IDCOL widened its operation and started \nfinancing on its balance sheet after Government of Bangladesh injected further equity capital \ninto the company. IDCOL acts as a catalyst for attracting private debt financing in infrastructure \nsubprojects as it pursues its objective of developing infrastructure. The recent strengthening of \nIDCOL\u2019s  balance  sheet  through  several  capital  injections  by  Government  of  Bangladesh \ndemonstrates the government\u2019s intention to continue supporting the company and its mandate. \nIt is also the only financial institution that catalyzes international knowledge and funds for \ninfrastructure finance. \n \n20.  Institutional  Reforms  at  IDCOL.  IDCOL  has  started  to  strengthen  its  subproject \nassessment capabilities and capacity and has initiated its own marketing program to source \npotential business opportunities independently. These activities will be further supported by the \nADB technical assistance for capacity building. To improve its skill and capacity, IDCOL may \nalso enter into strategic partnerships with international organizations involved in infrastructure \ninvestments, advisory services, and development/marketing of renewable energy. IDCOL is also \nworking  on  a  human  resources  strategy  to  address  the  concern  that  the  company\u2019s \nmanagement  team  is  quite  small.  Committees  have  been  formed  to  conduct  specific \nresponsibilities to ensure that IDCOL operates efficiently and with clear responsibilities. These \ninclude: (i)  credit committee\u2014reviews all final term sheets and subproject appraisal reports \nbefore these are submitted to the Board for final approval, the multi-stakeholder committee also \nmakes  recommendations  for  pricing  of  all  IDCOL  loans;  (ii)  recruitment  and  promotion \ncommittee,  a  six-member  committee  reviews  and  recommends  to  the  Board  all  new ", "Appendix 11   73\nrecruitments  and  promotions  of  personnel  within  IDCOL;  and  (iii)  audit  committee,  a  two-\nmember committee to ensure the independence of IDCOL's internal control functions and audit \nactivities in compliance with the audit requirements of its various development partners. This \nCommittee is responsible for: overseeing the activities of IDCOL's internal auditor; defining the \nscope  of  the  IDCOL  audit;  and  taking  appropriate  actions  to  address  any  violations  of \nindependence that are brought to its attention by IDCOL\u2019s internal and external auditors. \n \n21.  Transparency Measures. ADB has reviewed the corporate governance structure of \nIDCOL to ensure that sound and transparent business processes and management systems are \nin place to mitigate any potential corruption risks and vulnerabilities. IDCOL is governed by the \nlaws which prescribe disclosure norms. IDCOL intends to self-regulate and has incorporated \nbest practices of nonbanking finance companies. In addition, IDCOL has been rated AA and \nAA1  respectively  by  two  local  rating  agencies  for  strengthening  its  compliance  with  best \ninternational practices. ADB held consultations with the executing agency Economic Relations \nDivision  and  IDCOL,  Bangladesh  Bank,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  private  sector. \nFurthermore,  on-site  due  diligence  was  conducted  with  sponsors  of  large  infrastructure \nsubprojects and participating organizations under IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy program. \n \n22.  Systematized Reviews. IDCOL\u2019s performance on PPIDF will be reviewed periodically at \nthree levels\u2014by IDCOL on a monthly basis, quarterly by IDCOL\u2019s board of directors, and \nannually by ADB. The review of performance for each month by IDCOL will be completed by the \n10th day of the next month. IDCOL\u2019s board of directors will review the performance every \nquarter and will forward the quarterly progress reports to ADB by the 10th day of the month after \nthe  quarterly  review.  ADB  will  review  the  quarterly  progress  reports  during  annual  review \nmissions, and during the tripartite reviews chaired by the Government. In addition, a midterm \nreview  of  the  investment  program  will  be  conducted  in  FY2009\u2013FY2010  that  will  identify \nproblems or weaknesses in implementation, suggest nominal changes in scope, outputs, and \ndue diligence, and agree on changes that may be needed.  \n \n23.  Due Diligence. The following due diligence measures have been undertaken to mitigate \nthe risks faced by the PPIDF: (i) ADB carried out a thorough financial due diligence to appraise \nthe financial strength and credit assessment capacity of IDCOL and found both satisfactory; (ii) \na detailed review of the corporate governance practice in Bangladesh and the structure in place \nat IDCOL was conducted, IDCOL\u2019s pipeline of transactions ready for financing was reviewed \nand found to be very robust and commercially sound; and (iii) the financial terms of the Asian \nDevelopment Fund and ordinary capital resources loan (such as currency and interest rates) \nreflect local market terms and avoid currency and pricing mismatches. \n \nD.  Recommendations \n24.  The  preceding  governance  and  corruption  risk  assessment  points  to  several \nrecommendations  for  enhancing  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  PPIDF.  These \nrecommendations include (i) drawing from the risk analysis conducted here, incorporate several \nprovisions  on  good  governance  and  anticorruption  as  loan  conditions  and  assurances  as \nrelevant;  (ii)  review  the  risk  analysis  with  the  Government  and  IDCOL  management  as \nnecessary; (iii) get stakeholder buy-in to\u2014and concurrence of\u2014governance and corruption risk \nmitigation strategies; and (iv) acquire information during monitoring review missions on (a) \nrevised structures and processes within IDCOL to assess progress in managing governance \nand corruption risks, (b) review of incidences of mismanagement and inefficiencies in IDCOL \noperations, and (c) policy dialogue and briefings that may refer to pertinent issues related to the \ninfrastructure financing and private sector development in Bangladesh. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080911154741+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081006112529+08'00'", "Title": ""}}
