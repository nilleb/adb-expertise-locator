INTRODUCTION \n1.  Improving domestic connectivity is one of the key strategic pillars of the government\u2019s \nNational Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), 2010\u20132014. It is also one of the strategic \nfoci of the government\u2019s Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia\u2019s Economic \nDevelopment (MP3EI), 2011\u20132025, issued in May 2011. With the aim of achieving higher and \nmore inclusive growth across Indonesia, the MP3EI has three strategic foci: (i) accelerating \neconomic development in six economic corridors; (ii) improving national connectivity; and (iii) \nstrengthening human resources, science, and technology, which are prerequisites to sustained, \naccelerated, and green growth. The new Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Partnership \nStrategy  2012\u20132014  currently  being  finalized  has  two  key  pillars\u2014inclusive  growth  and \nenvironment sustainability. Strategically, the RPJMN provides direction for the new country \npartnership strategy, while the MP3EI will be the convergence of ADB\u2019s sector and thematic \ninterventions1 and the government\u2019s vision of accelerated development. The policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 will support the government initiative on the second strategic focus \non improving domestic connectivity, with emphasis on interisland connectivity. Recognizing the \nneed  to  upgrade  its  capacity  to  support  accelerated  reforms  in  the  area,  the  government \nrequested the TA during the country partnership strategy consultation prior to the release of the \nMP3EI. The TA was first included in the ADB TA pipeline in May 2011. The priority areas \ncovered under the TA were formulated based on discussion with the Ministry of Transport \n(MOT), the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), and Coordinating Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs (CMEA) during ADB fact-finding and consultation missions. Agreement was \nreached with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementing arrangements, \ncost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Good economic management after the Asian financial crisis restored economic growth to \nan average of 5.1% during 2000\u20132009. Economic growth in 2010 strengthened further to 6.1% \nsupported  by  more  buoyant  investment  and  exports.  However,  significant  development \nchallenges remain. Recent economic growth is still significantly below the pre-crisis level and \nthe government\u2019s medium-term target of 7%\u20138% as stated in the RPJMN. While poverty and \nunemployment have trended downward, they remain relatively high. Poverty rates in some \nprovinces in eastern Indonesia are higher than elsewhere in the country. The government also \nintends to reduce inflation over the medium term\u2014it is higher and more volatile than in other \ncompetitor countries and is increasingly an issue that could potentially slow down poverty \nreduction. The major sources of recent inflationary pressure are on the supply side, with a \nvisible difference across provinces in the country, suggesting that the solution in the medium \nterm has to include improved domestic connectivity.  \n \n3.  The  government  recognizes  that  lagging  infrastructure,  underdeveloped  interisland \nconnectivity, and an inefficient logistics system are among key constraints on achieving its \ntarget of higher growth, faster poverty reduction, and lower inflation. Studies have pointed out \nthat infrastructure and logistics systems have emerged as a major constraint on accelerating \n                                                 \n1  The draft transport sector assessment strategy and road map includes ADB\u2019s strategy to support the government\u2019s \nobjective of improving domestic connectivity through support for a diagnostic assessment of logistics constraints. \nThis will identify those policy and regulatory barriers that hamper components of the multimodal transport system \nfrom working together seamlessly to provide efficient end-to-end transport services. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 November 2011. \n ", "2   \neconomic growth in Indonesia.3 The quality of Indonesia's infrastructure and logistics systems is \nlower  than  that  of  its  neighbors,  resulting  in  lower  levels  of  domestic  and  international \nconnectivity.  The  recent  success  of  the  country  in  maintaining  a  healthy  macroeconomic \nenvironment throughout the 2008 global financial crisis has boosted Indonesia\u2019s ranking in \nterms of economic competitiveness by 10 places in the Global Competitiveness Index to 46 in \n2011.4 However, Indonesia\u2019s ranking of 82 on overall quality of infrastructure is far below its \noverall ranking, implying that infrastructure is a drag on the country\u2019s competitiveness. The \nGlobal Enabling Trade Report ranked Indonesia 75 out of 121 countries in terms of efficiency of \ncustoms administration and 94 in terms of transparency of border administration in 2009.5 \nClearance at Indonesian ports take a very long time, with about 25% of import containers taking \nmore than 10 days to clear. Restrictive regulations result in low competition in the provision of \nlogistics services. Logistics costs in Indonesia are estimated at about 14% of total production \ncosts, compared to only about 5% in Japan.6 \n \n4.  The impact of lagging infrastructure, poor interisland connectivity, and an inefficient \nlogistics system has appeared in a number of forms. Sending a 40-foot (12.2 meter) container \nfrom Jakarta and Surabaya to Bitung (North Sulawesi) costs $600, compared to approximately \n$300 from Jakarta to Singapore, because small domestic container ships cannot capture the \nsame economies of scale available to larger vessels. Productivity (in containers moved per hour) \nof the typical crane in Indonesia ports is 40\u201345 containers while Singapore can achieve 100\u2013\n110 containers. According to one estimate, the average turnaround time for domestic shipping \nat the 25 strategic ports is 2.7 days. With average sailing time being 1.5 days, ships were \nspending about 75% of the total time between destinations at port. Due to delays in cargo \nhandling, the main shipping lines report that to keep to schedule they often have to leave \nJakarta port before loading is complete. Reflecting poor logistics and inadequate transport \ninfrastructure, about 70% of the rice price differences across provinces is explained by the \ndegree of remoteness.7 High interisland freight rates mean availability and prices of basic \ncommodities fluctuate widely in remote areas, resulting in higher average inflation in some \nprovinces in Indonesia. A bag of cement which costs Rp50,000 in Jakarta or Surabaya (Java) \nwill  cost  Rp75,000  in  Jayapura  and  Rp500,000  in  Wamena  (both  in  Papua).  In  addition, \nIndonesia\u2019s manufacturing sector is not well integrated into international production networks \nbecause of unreliable transport and high logistics costs.  \n \n5.  To  help  address  the  challenges,  the  connectivity  pillar  of  the  MP3EI  focuses  on \n(i) improving intra-economic-corridor connectivity by developing roads, shipping, and railways \nand improving local access to the centers of growth and facilities; (ii) improving inter-economic-\ncorridor connectivity by developing good interconnection between primary ports and airports \n(especially in eastern Indonesia) and reducing logistics and economic costs of intercorridor \ndelivery of goods and services; and (iii) improving international trade logistics by developing \nports  and  airports  as  international  hubs  in  western  and  eastern  Indonesia,  optimizing  the \noperation of customs, and improving the operation of international ports and airports through \n                                                 \n  2011.

After  the  issuance  of  the  MP3EI,  the \ngovernment revisit, harmonize, synergize, and update its existing planning documents, such as \nthe National Logistics System and the National Transportation System. The updates will be \nreflected in the annual implementation plan of connectivity programs. This exercise can be \nstrengthened  significantly  with  updated  information,  particularly  on  inter-economic-corridor \nconnectivity.  \n \n6.  Connecting less-developed eastern Indonesia to domestic and international markets will \nimprove  access  to  goods  and  services  at  lower,  more  stable  prices,  as  well  as  increase \nproduction and the volume of domestic and international trade by lowering transaction costs. In \naddition, improved connectivity will (i) support greater integration between provinces to reduce \nprice volatility resulting from the impact of sudden shocks in production or demand; (ii) increase \nmarket access as well as the competitiveness of Indonesian goods, including those from the \neastern  part  of  the country;  and  (iii)  contribute  to  greater  diversification  in  production  and \nexports  while  encouraging  domestic  rather  than  foreign  commodity  processing,  thereby \nincreasing employment and reducing poverty. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  will  be  to  enhance  implementation  of  reforms  to  improve  interisland \nconnectivity. The outcome will be the strengthened analytical capacity of the MOT, BAPPENAS, \nand CMEA to deliver policy analysis on domestic connectivity to support their annual planning \nand strategy.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will provide inputs to the review and updating process of government planning \ndocuments by developing basic databases, key performance indicators, and selected analysis \nof interisland connectivity constraints. The TA will cover four core areas:  \n(i)  reviewing the existing planning documents and related regulations and doing a \nstock take of recent studies and relevant international experience;  \n(ii)  conducting a logistics chain survey of three key commodities on four origin\u2013\ndestination pairs for each to establish initial case study data and to identify key \nconstraints on efficient interisland connectivity;  \n(iii)  developing tools to assess policy and reform options and physical programs to \naddress the most critical constraints; and  \n(iv)  developing a capacity building program in the MOT and BAPPENAS.  \n \n9.  Reviewing documents and stocktaking of studies. The TA will review the existing \nplanning documents (such as the National Logistics System and the National Transportation \nSystem) and related regulations. The TA will also review findings of recent studies and surveys \nrelated to interisland connectivity and logistics in Indonesia. Recently, the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development proposed better practice and a number of key institutional reforms to \nimprove the implementation of public service obligations. The World Bank is conducting a study \non the eastern part of Indonesia covering (i) logistics chain analysis to identify market access \nconstraints, (ii) capacity and performance of ports along major routes in eastern Indonesia, and \n(iii) feasible ways to use performance-based contracting to improve competition. The Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  has  also  been  involved  in  studies  related  to  interisland \ntransport. These sources will be complemented by periodic review on economic development \n ", "4   \nacross provinces in Indonesia conducted by Bank Indonesia. The TA will also review relevant \ninternational  experience,  including  from  Japan  and  the  Philippines\u2019  experience  related  to \nnautical highway development and institutional reforms, to demonstrate the benefits of similar \nreforms to improve intercorridor connectivity.  \n \n10.  Conducting a logistics chain survey. The TA will support a logistics chain survey of \nkey priority commodities listed in the MP3EI on four origin\u2013destination pairs for each to establish \ninitial case study data and to identify key constraints on efficient interisland connectivity. The \nsurveys will (i) estimate inter-province trade and passenger services in two selected areas, one \nin western Indonesia and one in eastern Indonesia;8 (ii) collect data needed to develop costs \nand the determinants of the cost structure across logistics systems to help define areas that \nneed clear policy intervention and physical investment; and (iii) cover interconnection between \nmodes of transport\u2014shipping, road transport, and railway. The information collected from the \nsurvey will also be used to develop initial key performance indicators for ports, airports, and \nlogistics providers. The survey will also help assess other impediments to domestic connectivity, \nincluding institutional, regulatory, and physical impediments. \n \n11.  Assessing policy options and physical programs. The principal output of the TA will \nbe assessment of selected policy options and investment programs that the government may \nundertake  to  address  the  constraints.  After  completion  of  the  review  and  the  survey,  the \npotential policy and investment options will be analyzed using an applied economy-wide general \nequilibrium economic model and other tools. The model will have appropriate desegregation for \nprovinces in the country as well as a detailed poverty module to capture the impacts\u2014both \neconomic  and  poverty  related\u2014of  the  policy  reform  and  investment  programs,  leading  to \nimproved  intercorridor  connectivity  and  domestic  logistics  systems.  In  the  case  of  eastern \nIndonesia, minimum service standards will need to be established for shipping and air transport, \nas well as port access and service standards for both passengers and freight. Under the TA, \ncomprehensive  analyses  for  selected  cases  will  be  developed  to  identify  policies  and \ninstitutional arrangements to achieve minimum service, infrastructure, and efficiency standards. \n \n12.  Building capacity. The TA will include a capacity development program for the MOT, \nBAPPENAS, and related government agencies. Staff from these agencies will participate in all \nTA activities. Around 20\u201330 staff will be trained in economic model and impact assessment \nanalysis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  through  the  provision  of  office  space,  office  communications,  and \nremuneration and per diem for counterpart staff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 23 months, from 15 January 2012 to 15 December \n2013. The MOT will be the executing agency. The MOT, CMEA and BAPPENAS will be the \nimplementing agencies. The MOT will establish and chair the TA steering committee. The \nsteering committee will convene as needed, and be regularly consulted on implementation of TA \n                                                 \n8  Interisland transport systems are characterized by congestion in the west and lack of traffic in the east. \n ", "  5\nactivities. The MOT will ensure that key stakeholders participate in surveys and stakeholder \nconsultations.  These  stakeholders  include  relevant  state  enterprises,  transport  operator \nassociations, and industry associations. The MOT, CMEA and BAPPENAS will ensure that \ngovernment counterpart staff members participate in capacity building and other TA activities. \nThe TA consultants will administer workshops, training, seminars, conferences, and surveys.  \n \n15.  In consultation with the MOT, ADB will recruit consultants as required under the TA (17 \nperson-months of consulting services, consisting of one international consultant for 5 person-\nmonths and two national consultants for a total of 12 person-months). The team of consultants, \nled  by  the  international  consultant,  will  be  responsible  for  producing  the  TA  outputs  and \ndeliverables  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner,  and  for  organizing  and  carrying  out  all  TA \nactivities.  The  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).9 Consultants will be chosen \nbased on their academic qualifications and relevant work experience. The proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nImproving Domestic Connectivity, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n9  Given the nature of the expertise required, it is deemed more appropriate to engage consultants individually than \nhiring through a firm. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nEnhanced  Lower share of transport  Domestic trade  Sustained government \nimplementation of  and logistics costs in the  statistics.  commitment for capacity \nreforms to improve  country\u2019s overall cost of    development of the \ninterisland connectivity   domestic production to  Government reports.
