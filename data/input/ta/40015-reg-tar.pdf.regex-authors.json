INTRODUCTION \n1.  This regional technical assistance (RETA) will support the implementation of the trade \nfacilitation aspects of the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy endorsed by the Sixth \nMinisterial  Conference  on  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  held  in \nDushanbe,  Tajikistan  on  3  November  2007.  The  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.1\n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been playing a major role in support of a \nregional and concerted approach for trade policy reforms and trade facilitation. Initially, the \nprogram comprised seven ADB developing member countries: Azerbaijan, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.2 Afghanistan \nlater joined CAREC in 2005.  The program has been coordinated by the Customs Cooperation \nCommittee (CCC), consisting of the heads of customs administrations of the nine participating \ncountries. The CCC endorsed an action plan in its first meeting in Urumqi, PRC in August 2002.  \n \n3.  ADB  has  served  as  the  secretariat  of  the  CCC,  and  supported  the  regional  trade \nfacilitation program through five loans and two regional technical assistance (RETA) projects.3 \nThe short- to medium-term objectives of the CCC are to promote concerted customs reforms \nand modernization, and to serve as a regional forum to address issues of common interest. The \npriority  areas  were  proposed  by  participating  member  countries  to  the  CCC,  taking  into \nconsideration changing country and regional priorities and circumstances. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The CCC has been successful in: (i) establishing a cooperative spirit among the region\u2019s \ncustoms officials; (ii) introducing international best practices; (iii) achieving bilateral agreements; \n(iv) formulating appropriate strategies and sequencing of activities with clearly identified goals, \nobjectives, outputs, and activities; and (v) building good organizational structures for regions \ncustoms equipped with skilled human resources. \n \n5.  However,  a  more  coordinated  and  consistent  approach  is  needed  across  all  CCC \nmembers for simplification and harmonization of customs procedures and practices. Project \nimplementation capability needs to be strengthened to reduce overreliance on donor support. \nBetter  and  effective  coordination  is  also  needed  with  other  trade  related  agencies  and \nstakeholders for integrated trade facilitation, where customs may provide a leadership role. \nWhile training and studies are necessary, achieving results on the ground is critical to sustain \nthe momentum of the trade facilitation program. \n                                                 \n1  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 9 November 2007. \n2  Turkmenistan, as an observer of CAREC, has been attending the Customs Cooperation Committee (CCC) meeting \nand other activities on a regular basis. \n3  ADB. 2006.

After years of reform and intensified regional cooperation efforts, the participation of \nCentral Asian countries in global production networks and related international trade remains \nlimited.4 Despite their geographical proximity, trade between the Central Asian countries and \nAfghanistan remains limited. The exports of Central Asian economies are dominated by a small \nnumber of primary products and there has been limited success in diversifying exports. The \ndegree of integration in the global economy has been disappointing, largely because trade has \nbeen obstructed by unnecessary high costs of trade. Some of these costs derive from the \nCAREC countries\u2019 landlocked situation, which makes trade and transit problems especially \nsevere.   \n \n7.  Trade facilitation plays a vital role for the CAREC countries, especially in expanding \nintra- and inter-regional trade, which is perceived to spur investments and economic growth in \nthe long term. The benefits from the removal of deficiencies and inefficiencies in cross-border \ntrade can be much greater to stakeholders than the removal of tariff barriers.5 Trade facilitation \nrelates to a wide range of activities such as import or export procedures (e.g., customs or \nlicensing  procedures);  transport  formalities;  and  payments,  insurance,  and  other  financial \nrequirements.  It  is  distinguished  from  trade  policy,  as  reflected  in  legislated  tariff  rates  or \nnontariff barriers to trade, and from the hard infrastructure of roads, ports, etc. An alternative \nway of delimiting trade facilitation, which is useful in the CAREC context, is to distinguish \nbetween trade costs that arise because of (i) lack of integrated border management, so that \ncomplex procedures at the border, or in preparation for crossing the border, impose time and \nmoney costs on traders; (ii) lack of coordination between the two sides of the border; and (iii) \nbehind-the-border trade costs. \n \n8.  Studies  have  documented  the  excessive  border  delays  and  large  number  of  forms \nneeded by importers and exporters in the region. At most borders, it is necessary to comply with \na range of procedures in addition to customs\u2014including animal quarantine, inspection of plants \nand other agricultural materials, checking of drivers\u2019 licenses, axle loads, and compliance with \nother  rules  of  the  road.  Simplification  and  harmonization  of  these  procedures  are  a  core \nbusiness of trade facilitation. International agreements on standardized forms6 can help, but a \nkey requirement is the need to shift policy emphasis to place more weight on trade facilitation \nrather than trade control. In addition, behind-the-border trade costs, especially the frequent road \nchecks that are often accompanied by an official or unofficial fine, are endemic and considerably \nraise the cost of doing business in the region. This must be dealt with primarily at the national \nlevel.  \n \n9.  During  the  CAREC  Ministerial  Conference  in  Urumqi,  PRC  in  October  2006,  the \nministers called for action to overcome trade and other impediments to development. The draft \nTFS was considered at the Sixth Meeting of the CCC on 6\u20137 September 2007 in Manila, \nPhilippines. The CCC broadly endorsed the key elements of the TFS and recommended that a \n                                                 \n4  One indication of this is the relatively low degree of intra-industry trade. The Grubel-Lloyd index shows that \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan are involved in intra-industry trade to a much lesser degree than the PRC \nand, while intra-industry trade is relatively high for resource-based, unskilled labor-intensive products, it is low for \nskilled-labor and technology-intensive products (ADB. 2006. Central Asia: Increasing Gains from Trade through \nRegional Cooperation in Trade Policy, Transport and Customs Transit. Manila.). The PRC has become much more \ninvolved in international production networks over the last decade, but these are primarily with countries in East and \nSoutheast Asia and only involve Xinjiang to a limited degree. \n5  Trade and Investment Division. 2006.

", "  3\ntime-bound action plan be prepared for implementation of the TFS. The draft TFS was later \npresented to the CAREC Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting on 8\u20139 September 2007 and obtained its \nendorsement. A key feature of the TFS is to concentrate trade facilitation reforms along the \ndesignated CAREC transport corridors. It also proposes a results based approach to monitor \ntravel time and costs along the priority corridors, and envisages strengthening interaction with \nboth international technical agencies and regional organizations.  \n \n10.  Guidance from the CAREC Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting included: (i) placing emphasis on \nthe role of trade facilitation in improving the competitiveness of CAREC countries\u2019 goods and \nservices; (ii) the need to take account of the different level of development of CAREC countries; \n(iii) the desirability of coordinating with non-CAREC neighboring countries and subregional \norganizations;  (iv) addressing  integrity  issues  more  explicitly;  (v)  supporting  bilateral \nagreements  and  accession  to  multinational  agreements;  (vi)  improved  coordination  among \nCAREC sector committees; (vii) the importance of supporting logistics development; and (viii) \nthe importance of improving national coordination of the range of agencies involved in trade \nfacilitation. \n \n11.  Customs cooperation will remain the core of the TFS. The medium-term objective will be \nto  promote  concerted  customs  reforms  and  modernization,  with  the  Trade  Facilitation  and \nCustoms Cooperation Committee (TFCCC), with an expanded mandate for integrated trade \nfacilitation, serving as a regional forum to address issues of common interest. The process of \nchanging  the  culture  of  customs  administrations  from  control  orientation  to  compliance \nfacilitation, which is crucial, has begun. The strategy will support this process. The TFCCC will \nalso assist in establishing or strengthening national trade facilitation committees in CAREC \ncountries. Participation in the national committees will be tailored to ensure effective functioning \nwithin  each  country\u2019s  relevant  government  and  other  structures.  Lastly,  the  trade  logistics \ncomponent of the strategy will facilitate the development of an efficient regional logistics industry. \nThe  work  program,  which  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  related  efforts  of  the  CAREC \ntransportation facilitation program, will include (i) establishment of a regional forum to harmonize \nand plan trade logistics development; (ii) support for national level trade logistics assessments; \nand (iii) facilitation and financing of key investments, including public-private partnerships. \n \n12.  ADB has been working closely with WCO and the World Trade Organization from the \nbeginning of the CAREC trade facilitation program for joint studies and seminars. ADB has also \ncooperated with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), and Eurasian Economic \nCommunity (EurAsEC), including implementation of joint programs. The World Bank, United \nNations  Development  Programme,  and  European  Commission\u2014as  well  as  some  bilateral \ndonors such as German development cooperation through GTZ and the State Secretariat for \nEconomic Affairs (SECO) of Switzerland\u2014are also active in trade facilitation and transit trade \nprograms in the CAREC region. The new strategy envisages continued cooperation with these \norganizations. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the proposed RETA is sustained economic growth and improved living \nstandards  through  the  expansion  of  international  and  intra-regional  trade.  The  outcome  is \ngreater volume of trade, intra- and extra-regionally, due to time and cost savings achieved from \nharmonized cross-border regulations, procedures, and standards; and improved logistics.  \n \n14.  The expected outputs of the RETA include (i) strengthened customs cooperation as the \ncore program of the trade facilitation strategy, (ii) expanded scope of the work program to \naddress broader issues of trade facilitation, (iii) focusing trade facilitation efforts on the CAREC \ntransport  corridors,  (iv)  adoption  of  a  results-based  approach  in  monitoring  time  and  cost \nsavings as the key indicators of the program, (v) support for logistics assessments and planning \nfocusing on priority corridors and developing national and regional implementation strategies to \nfacilitate trade, (vi) support for bilateral initiatives among CAREC countries with sharing of \nexperience, (vii) enhanced partnership between CAREC's participating multilateral institutions \nand  key  international  agencies  supporting  customs  reform,  trade  facilitation,  and  logistics \ndevelopment in the region, (viii) dialogue and cooperation with the private sector, which would \nhelp formulate and utilize trade facilitation measures, (ix) capacity-building activities in areas of \nintegrated trade facilitation as well as in broader areas related to trade and transport facilitation,7 \nand (x) knowledge products such as policy and strategic papers, publication of analytical pieces, \nand presentation at conference on issues of customs cooperation, integrated trade facilitation, \nand trade logistics issues. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The following actions will be undertaken:  \n \n(i)  Promoting concerted customs reform and modernization and serving as a regional forum \nto address issues of common concern, focusing on tasks of (a) harmonization of custom \nprocedures and documentation; (b) customs automation; (c) data exchange; (d) joint \ncustoms control; (e) risk management, post-entry audit, and customs intelligence; (f) \nregional transit development; (g) frameworks for customs cooperation; and (h) training. \n(ii)  Supporting  an  integrated  trade  facilitation  approach  by  (a)  establishing  a  regional \nmechanism  for  integrated  trade  facilitation  to  complement  and  strengthen  the  CCC \nprocess;  (b)  establishing  national  transport  and  trade  facilitation  committees; \n(c) establishing  one-stop  and  single  electronic  window  services;  (d)  enhancing \ncooperation  in  other  trade  related  areas  (such  as  quarantine,  sanitary  and  pseudo \nsanitary) as well as those behind the border issues (such as product standards and \nother technical barriers to trade); (e) priority trade facilitation support for the designated \nCAREC  transport  corridors;  (f)  bilateral  initiatives  to  pilot  test  an  integrated  trade \nfacilitation approach; (g) accession to international conventions in support of integrated \ntrade  facilitation;  (h)  establishing  a  technical  level  forum  for  the  range  of  agencies \ninvolved in providing trade facilitation support to the region to improve coordination and \ndevelop  good  practice  models;  and  (i)  managing  for  results  through  establishing  a \n                                                 \n7   ADB is running a set of streamlined training programs through the CAREC Institute. The institute can also play an \ninstrumental role in disseminating information on the monitoring of transport corridors through the portal, forums, \nand publications. Part of its role could be to support think tanks in the region and they could play a role in \nanalyzing the issues and problems involved with making improvements to the passage of vehicles on the \nmonitored transport corridors. ", "  5\nmonitoring mechanism to measure performance (including time/cost/distance surveys, \nuser surveys and administrative data from national agencies). \n(iii)  Developing efficient regional trade logistics industries to (a) establish a regional forum to \nharmonize and plan trade logistics development; (b) support national level trade logistics \nassessments; and (c) facilitate and assist to finance key investments, including public-\nprivate partnerships. \n \n16.  The proposed RETA has been designed and will be implemented in close coordination \nwith the CAREC regional transport cooperation program. Studies such as WCO\u2019s time release \nanalyses will be conducted for six CAREC transport corridors, and trade facilitation measures \nwill be introduced. The RETA will also support strengthening of trade and transport facilitation \ncommittees.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,600,000 equivalent, of which $3,000,000 \nequivalent is proposed to be provided by ADB on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe governments participating in the RETA will contribute around $600,000 equivalent in total \nby providing counterpart staff; office space; and support for training, seminars, and conferences. \nThe TA will primarily finance the costs of the conferences, seminars, and training, as well as \nadministrative costs associated with TFCCC annual meetings. Details of the cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. The Country Coordination, Regional \nCooperation,  Governance,  Finance  and  Trade  Division  of  the  East  Asia  Department  will \nadminister and implement the RETA with support from the Central and West Asia Department, \nconcerned customs administrations, and other stakeholders. No activity in the territory of a \ncountry will be financed by ADB under the RETA unless such member country has concurred to \nsuch financing. \n \n19.  The  RETA  will  require  50  person-months  (25  international  and  25  national)  of \nintermittent consulting services. There is a separate budget to engage additional international \nand national specialists for specific technical areas during implementation, as the need arises. \nConsultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  specialists  in  the  areas  of  customs  reform  and \nmodernization, integrated trade facilitation, and regional trade logistics. In view of the RETA\u2019s \nvaried  activities,  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  and  resource \npersons are in Appendix 3. Procurement of equipment under the RETA will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nImplementation is expected to cover 3 years from January 2008 to December 2010. \n \nIV.
