I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of $500 million, with a sovereign guarantee; and (ii) a proposed loan of $250 million, \nwithout a sovereign guarantee, both to the Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID) in \nIndia for the National Grid Improvement Project.1  \n \n2.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  interregional  connections  for  bulk  electric  power \ntransmission from 14 private independent power producers (IPPs) in the state of Chhattisgarh in \nthe western grid region to demand centers in the northern grid region of the country including \nDelhi and the states of Haryana and Punjab. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector overview. The Indian power sector has a history of growing demand for and \nchronic shortages of electricity.2 During FY2010, the country\u2019s peak power deficit was at 12.7% \nand the average energy deficit at 10.1%. The country is in constant need of additional power \nsupply and the power sector suffers the shortfalls in both generation and transmission capacity. \nAchieving efficient delivery of all the power that the growing economy needs is a national priority \nand critical to sustaining India\u2019s long-term development. \n \n4.  To  alleviate  the  country\u2019s  acute  power  shortage,  the  Government  of  India  has \ntraditionally focused on increasing power generation. The private sector has joined this effort \nand has added greatly to generation capacity over the last 4 years,3 but transmission investment \nhas lagged. India has an installed generation capacity of 173,626 megawatts (MW) at present \nbut its interregional transmission capacity of about 23,800 MW is 13.7% of this total. Based on \nincreasing  generation  capacity,  commensurate  improvements  in  the  transmission  system \nexpansion are urgently needed.   \n \n5.  To optimize the transfer and use of power throughout the country, the government aims \nto  integrate  its five  regional  power  grids,  which  serve  the  northern,  northeastern,  eastern, \nwestern, and southern regions. Although individual regions try to connect and synchronize the \nstate power systems within their grids, limited interregional transmission capacity has restricted \nthe transfer of power between them. Interregional transmission superhighways are needed \nbecause India\u2019s natural energy resources and generation sites are unevenly distributed. Without \nthese highways, regions with surplus power at a given time cannot effectively transfer electricity \nto regions facing power deficits. To use energy efficiently through the nation and overcome this \nregional disparity, the government\u2019s five-year plans seek to increase interregional transmission \ncapacity from 23,800 MW to 27,950 MW by FY2012, 57,000 MW by FY2015, and 75,000 MW \nby FY2017. Strengthening the interregional transmission network will promote open access to \npower  supply,  increase  investment  in  both  generation  and  distribution,  help  integrate  the \nelectricity market, and encourage power trading and competitive electricity prices. \n \n6.  Borrower. As the country\u2019s central transmission utility, POWERGRID is responsible for \nplanning, developing, and operating India\u2019s national transmission network, operating more than \n95% of interregional and interstate power transmission.4 POWERGRID was incorporated in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  After  adding  1,931  MW  in additional  capacity  during  the  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (FY2003\u2013FY2007),  private \ninvestment had already raised capacity by 11,040 MW as of 31 January 2011 under the current plan (FY2008\u2013\nFY2012).  \n4  Unlike interregional and interstate transmission, intrastate transmission is owned by state utilities. ", "2 \n1989 as a public limited company wholly owned by the central government. The company was \ninitially listed in the domestic stock markets in October 2007 with an initial float of 11% of its \nshares. In 2010, the government reduced its shareholdings to 69%. By the end of the twelfth \nfive-year plan up to FY2017, POWERGRID plans to invest about $22 billion to more than double \nthe size of its network. This will be crucial to making effective use of the new power generation \nbeing developed by public and private utilities. To support its ambitious investment plan, the \ncompany proposes to diversify its sources of debt capital by tapping the commercial lending \nmarket. POWERGRID now relies predominantly on two sources of debt: domestic bond issues \n(67% of total debt outstanding) and sovereign guaranteed loans from multilateral banks (27%).5 \nTo help strengthen and diversify POWERGRID\u2019s ability to raise funding for future investment, \nthe  government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  include  a  unique  financing \nstructure  in  the  2010  country  program,  combining  a  nonsovereign  loan  and  a  sovereign \nguaranteed loan in a single financing package. The government wants to demonstrate this novel \nfinancing package as a transitional arrangement for large publicly owned entities, including \ncentral public sector undertakings (CPSUs) that must increasingly become capable of raising \nmarket funds on their own account. Doing so will enable the CPSUs to meet their sizable \ninvestment requirements independently while gradually reducing dependence on government \nguarantees.  \n \n7.  Project design. POWERGRID\u2019s immediate investment plans focus on the transmission \nprojects required to deliver electricity from 55 new IPP power generation plants to primary load \ncenters. Known collectively as the high capacity power transmission corridors program, these \nprojects  include  nine  major  transmission  schemes  approved  by  the  Central  Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (CERC) with an estimated total cost of more than $12.9 billion. The \nproject proposed for ADB financing is the biggest of these transmission schemes and involves \n14 IPPs and a public power trading company in Chhattisgarh. It will strengthen interregional \ntransmission between the western and the northern regional grids and supply additional bulk \npower to the north from generation of IPPs in Chhattisgarh, which will generate over 15,000 MW \nin total.6 The project will create a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system using \nsmart grid technology to support stable, efficient, flexible, and economical long-distance power \ntransfer among its interconnected systems. HVDC is a least-cost and low-carbon investment \noption. \n \n8.  Alignment of  ADB  strategy and operations. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 20207 and the 2009\u20132012 India country partnership strategy. The country partnership \nstrategy includes continuous support for interstate and interregional transmission networks as \npart of the national level sector development strategy. It also directs ADB to leverage the \nfinancing capacity of CPSUs through its nonsovereign lending modality to help them meet \nsubstantial borrowing requirements under the government\u2019s five-year plans.8 \n \n9.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  policy  directive,  which  highlights  the \nenhancement of energy efficiency in transmission systems. Since 1995, ADB has provided \nPOWERGRID with five sovereign guaranteed loans to help strengthen the transmission system \nnationally.  Three  ongoing  loans  comprise  a  sector  loan  and  two  loan  tranches  from  a \n                                                \n5  The balance 6% of debt is mostly from legacy domestic bank  facilities, suppliers\u2019 credit transactions, and \nsovereign-guaranteed facilities from bilateral agencies dating from the 1990s to the early 2000s. \n6  HVDC transmission technology will improve efficiency and reduce transmission loss when compared with existing \ninterregional alternating current transmission system. The new system is to deliver 3,000 MW initially and will be \nincreased to 6,000 MW by adding upgraded terminals later. The rest of power generated from IPPs will be supplied \nwithin the western region. \n7  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n8  The 2010 country program for India confirmed the government\u2019s aim to graduate strong CPSUs from use of \nsovereign facilities in a phased manner, in favor of funding other development programs. ", "3 \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).9 These  facilities  have  had  satisfactory  performance, \nwarranting  continued  ADB  engagement  with  POWERGRID.10 The  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment 2010 validation report for the second loan rated POWERGRID\u2019s performance highly \nsuccessful.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project impact will be to accelerate the development of the interregional grid system \nto  deliver  increased  power  supply  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  The  project \noutcome,  strengthened  transmission  capacity  and  more  efficient  operations,  will  increase \nreliable power supply from private IPPs and public utilities through the interconnected grid. The \nproject will facilitate integration of electricity markets and create power trading opportunities \nthrough open access and competition among private and public utilities. It will expand the \nmarket for potential power sellers and buyers beyond their own regional grids. This will help \npromote private investment in generation and distribution. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project outputs will include (i) a strengthened interregional transmission network \nbetween  the  northern  and  western  grid  regions  through  physical  investment;  and  (ii) \nimprovements  in  POWERGRID\u2019s  access  to  and  management  of  financial  credit  by  the \npromotion of diversification of its funding sources through combined nonsovereign loan and \nsovereign guaranteed loan of ADB. The physical output will comprise (i) 800 kilovolts (kV) \nHVDC transmission line between Champa in Chhattisgarh and Kurukshetra in Haryana (about \n1,365 kilometers); and (ii) establishment of HVDC terminals at Champa and Kurukshetra. \n \nD.

Manila. \n12 The overall investment cost includes 400 kV transmission lines in Haryana and Punjab (about 318 kilometers) to \nbe financed by POWERGRID as integrated facilities of the project. \n ", "4 \n13.  To  support  the  $2,250  million  cost,  POWERGRID  will  make  an  equity  contribution \nequivalent to $675 million (30% of the project cost) from its own resources, as regulated by \nCERC tariff norms.13 ADB will support project funding through a sovereign guaranteed loan of \n$500 million and a nonsovereign corporate loan of $250 million. The ADB loans will be used \nprimarily  to  implement the  HVDC  terminals  on  a  turnkey  basis. To  assure  that funds  are \nefficiently deployed and available for this portion of the project, the sovereign loan will only be \nmade available upon the closure and availability of the nonsovereign loan.  The remaining \nproject cost will be financed from proceeds from POWERGRID\u2019s regular domestic bond issues \nand/or other financiers.14 Table 2 summarizes the financing plan. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n   Amount  Share of  \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (sovereign guaranteed loan)  500.0  22.2 \nAsian Development Bank (nonsovereign corporate loan)   250.0  11.1 \nPOWERGRID (internal resources)  675.0  30.0 \nPOWERGRID (other sources)a  825.1  36.7 \n Total  2,250.1  100.0 \nPOWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India. \na   Expected  to  be  POWERGRID\u2019s  domestic  bond  issuance  and/or  parallel  financing  from  the \ncommercial banking sector and/or other financial institutions.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  Sovereign guaranteed loan. The government and POWERGRID have requested a \nsovereign guaranteed loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with the ADB loan facility based on the London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR), a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  guarantee  agreements.  The  government  and \nPOWERGRID have provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n15.  Nonsovereign loan. A parallel loan to POWERGRID is proposed for up to $250 million \nwithout sovereign guarantee, with a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period 4 years. The \nloan will carry an interest rate, commitment and front-end fees to be determined by ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee. The loan will be supported by the strength of POWERGRID\u2019s corporate \ncredit.15 The loan is proposed to be secured by a pari passu floating charge on the corporate \nassets of POWERGRID, details of which will be agreed during loan negotiations. \n \n16.  Risk participation. ADB is exploring a range of risk-sharing arrangements with eligible \ncommercial cofinanciers to transfer a portion of the commercial and political risks in respect of \nthe nonsovereign loan. \n \n17.  Investment limitations. The proposed nonsovereign loan size lies within the country, \nindustry, group, and single project exposure limits for ADB nonsovereign investments. \n \n                                                \n13 CERC regulates a debt\u2013equity ratio of 70:30 in setting transmission tariffs for each project. \n14 POWERGRID has initiated discussions with commercial banks and financial institutions to explore the possibility of \nfunding on nonsovereign operations. POWERGRID also regularly issues domestic bonds. \n15 While drawdown against the two loans will be linked to underlying progress payments on the project, the credit \nobligation for nonsovereign loan rests with the corporate credit. ", "5 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.16 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2011\u2013December 2016 \nEstimated closing date  30 June 2017 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Coordination committee, comprising CEA and POWERGRID \n(ii)  Executing agency  POWERGRID a \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  POWERGRID \n(iv)  Implementation unit  POWERGRID\u2019s western and northern regional offices, with about \n100 staff  \nProcurement  ICB  7 contracts  $750 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  All eligible contract packages and eligible expenditures agreed \nadvance contracting  between ADB and the borrower have been approved for retroactive \nfinancing and advance contracting. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between POWERGRID and \nADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEA = Central Electricity Authority, ICB = International Competitive Bidding, \nPOWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India.  \na  The company\u2019s board comprises 14 directors. Five are full-time directors, two are appointed by the government, \nand seven are independent.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and POWERGRID estimates. \n \n19.  Procurement. The project will be completed by 2016. POWERGRID\u2019s performance in \nprocurement has been good during past and ongoing ADB-funded projects.17 POWERGRID \nasked  ADB  for  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  the  project.  All \nprocurement under the project will follow International Competitive Bidding in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  Disbursement. The sovereign and nonsovereign loan proceeds will jointly finance the \nprocurement of equipment. The financing and disbursements for each contract package will be \non a pro rata basis.18 \n \n21.  Other arrangements. The project was approved for implementation by the government \nunder the Electricity Act, 2003. POWERGRID has already signed bulk power transmission \nagreements (BPTA) for the project with 14 IPPs and the Chhattisgarh State Power Trading \nCompany to ensure offtake arrangements as defined by the CERC regulations. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n22.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project is innovative in the following respects:  \n \n(i)  Energy efficient technology. The project will adopt advanced 800 kV HVDC \ntransmission lines that have so far been used only elsewhere in India and in the \n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 The procurement capacity assessment report has identified no substantial issues on project implementation. \n18 Debt funding for the project will be disbursed from the sovereign and nonsovereign loan proceeds simultaneously. \nFunds from the sovereign facility will only be disbursable upon the availability of funds from the nonsovereign \nfacility. Disbursements from the two loans will be maintained, at minimum, on specific weighted percentages. \n ", "6 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. This technology will significantly reduce power loss \nand support low-carbon growth.19 A large-scale HVDC supergrid network can \nalso help stabilize power supply frequencies and voltages, which in turn will \nsupport development of smart grid operations. \n(ii)  Promotion of private sector development. Through public sector\u2019s support for \nthe improvement of interregional transmission, the project will promote private \nsector development in power generation by facilitating the access of IPPs to \nmarkets. Public and private investment will be combined through the entire power \nsector  value  chain  to  leverage  project  benefits.  Better  interregional  grid \nconnectivity will greatly expand power trading opportunities and consequently \nboost  IPP  businesses.  Because  the  government  has  opened  investment  in \ninterregional transmission to competitive bidding, the project is also expected to \nattract private developers to similar transmission projects in other regions.20 \n(iii)  POWERGRID\u2019s self-financing capacity improvement. This will be the first time \nADB has combined sovereign and nonsovereign facilities for a single borrower. A \nforeign commercial term loan without credit support from governments will also \nbe a first for POWERGRID. The government encouraged ADB to provide the \nnonsovereign loan to help POWERGRID transition to and gain experience with \nmore  commercial  forms  of  funding.  POWERGRID  is  now  nearly  completely \nreliant on the domestic bond markets and recognizes the need to diversify its \nsources  of  debt.21 During  the  loan  process  and  through  ongoing  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance,22 ADB will help POWERGRID strengthen its \ncorporate credit capabilities to promote access to international capital markets \nand improve its fiscal planning and risk management. The nonsovereign loan will \nhelp  POWERGRID  (a)  establish  a  much-needed  benchmark  for  foreign \ncommercial  borrowing,  and  (b)  enhance  its  capacity  for  dealing  with  foreign \ncommercial  lending  institutions  before  launching  any  future  commercial \nborrowing program, such as an offshore syndicated loan or an international bond \nd\u00e9but.23 The nonsovereign loan facility will demonstrate to other financially viable \nCPSUs how to go about raising funds for the country\u2019s economic development in \na more autonomous manner. It will thereby serve as a catalyst for sustainable \neconomic growth while reducing strain on government finances and increasing \nfiscal space for other priority social programs. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The  800  kV  HVDC  transmission  system  is  state-of-the-art,  commercially  proven \ntechnology. The first such system in India is being implemented by POWERGRID under the \nADB-financed  MFF  (footnote  9).  The  project  is  expected  to  enhance  energy  efficiency  by \nreducing  transmission  losses  of  approximately  3%  below  levels  of  typical  conventional \n                                                \n19 The  project  will  support  a  reduction  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions  quantified  by  the  efficiency  gained  from \ntransmitting a fixed amount of energy across an HVDC transmission system versus a conventional alternating \ncurrent transmission system of equivalent length. \n20 To meet sizable investment requirements in interstate transmission, POWERGRID will also be required to consider \nexpanding the transmission network strategically  through structures such as public\u2013private partnership in a \ncompetitive environment. POWERGRID has established nine joint ventures with private and public companies. \n21 This is to promote funding sustainability and mitigate risks from any adverse changes in the bond markets that \ncould impair the investment plans. The domestic market has been constrained for large funding. \n22 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Innovative Financing Instruments for Power Grid. Manila. With support from \nADB, POWERGRID formulated the debt financing strategy. \n23 To diversify its funding sources, POWERGRID has explored other nonsovereign funding to finance a portion of the \nproject. For the ongoing project financed by ADB, POWERGRID is also pursuing the equivalent of combined $720 \nmillion in buyer\u2019s export credits and nonsovereign commercial borrowing. ", "7 \ntransmission systems. This in turn could result in the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions from \npower systems by an estimated 536,000 tons per year.24 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The  project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  9.54%,25 higher  than  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital. Its economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 22.10%.26 Thus, \nthe project is financially viable and economically sustainable. \n \n25.  The government has accorded POWERGRID \u201cNavratna\u201d (jewel) status, which gives a \nCPSU  managerial  and  financial  autonomy  despite  majority  government  ownership.  While \nPOWERGRID does not currently have an international credit rating, it has top domestic credit \nratings.27 Based  on  the  cost-plus  nature  of  the  tariff  setting  process  and  POWERGRID\u2019s \nsuperior  operating  efficiency,  it  has  increased  revenues  and  net  profits  consistently,  28 \nmaintaining a robust financial position with stable cash flows to cover its cost of services, capital \ninvestment, and debt payments. Over the last 3 years, it achieved a post-tax return on equity of \nover 10% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5. In FY2011, return on equity rose to 12.6% \nand the debt service coverage ratio improved to 1.8. POWERGRID\u2019s debt\u2013equity ratio has \nremained below 70:30. Based on its strong credit, POWERGRID has frequently raised large \namounts by issuing domestic bonds and equity.29 Although POWERGRID has an aggressive \ninvestment plan and a large need for additional borrowings, financial projections show that it will \nmaintain a sound financial position even under stress scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.   Enterprise risk management. Through public offerings for shares and bond issues, \nPOWERGRID  has  established  a  sound  corporate  governance  system.  In  February  2011, \nPOWERGRID introduced an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework to strengthen its \ncorporate governance. The framework has identified risks under four categories: (i) strategic, (ii) \noperational, (iii) financial, and (iv) others (e.g., human resources). The ERM also envisages \nappointment of a chief risk officer and a risk management committee. The ERM framework has \nbeen put in place and staff training began in June 2011. \n \n27.  Anticorruption  policy.  POWERGRID  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) and its Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB will require POWERGRID to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ADB \nand POWERGRID will allow ADB to review and examine any violation or potential violation of \nthese  undertakings. As  a  listed  company,  POWERGRID  is  subject  to  extensive  disclosure \nrequirements under the laws of India. \n \n                                                \n24 Clean Development Mechanism Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The weighted average cost of \ncapital is 3.92%. \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Since 2001, POWERGRID\u2019s domestic bonds have been rated AAA by CRISIL and LAAA by ICRA. From 2008, the \nCredit Analysis & Research has also given these bonds a rating of AAA. \n28 In FY2011, POWERGRID generated Rs91 billion in revenue, resulting in Rs27 billion in net profit, up 32% over the \nprevious financial year. \n29 Since FY2008, POWERGRID has issued new equity shares and the government has disposed of shares in equal \namounts. In FY2011, POWERGRID raised equity of Rs74.4 billion. POWERGRID has regularly issued bonds in the \ndomestic market since FY2001, raising more than Rs100 billion in FY2011 alone. \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The power sector plays a key role in improving economic development and social well-\nbeing.30 The project has developed an implementation strategy to avoid or minimize negative \nimpacts on affected people, with a focus on women and vulnerable groups. 31 Key social and \ngender-related design features include (i) gender-inclusive consultative processes, (ii) additional \nassistance for affected households headed by women in a resettlement framework, (iii) equal \nopportunities for women to access employment and equal pay under civil works contracts, and \n(iv) ensuring the incorporation of women's needs and concerns in all aspects related to project \ndesign and development (e.g., sanitation). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment,32 category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement,33 and category C for indigenous people. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), the potential environmental and social impacts and risks of the project \nhave been identified. Effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts are incorporated in a resettlement plan and initial environmental examination, \nincluding the environmental monitoring and management plan.34 The institutional capacity and \ncommitment  of  POWERGRID  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks  are \ndeemed  adequate. 35  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures36 \n \n30.  Counterparty risk. POWERGRID is exposed to counterparty risk both in (i) completion \nof  generation  projects,  and  (ii)  offtake  of  electricity  from  those  projects  upon  commercial \noperations.  However,  POWERGRID  is  well  protected  by  regulations.  BPTAs  are  signed \nbetween  generators  and  POWERGRID  on  terms  defined  by  regulation.  Each  generator \nconstructing a new power plant must post a performance bond with POWERGRID to cover \nliquidated  damages  in  the  event  of  delayed  completion.37 After  power  generation  begins, \ntransmission charge liability shifts from the generators to the designated offtakers, who are \nusually state distribution utilities. While the credit quality of the offtakers varies significantly, all \nofftakers  must  post  a  letter  of  credit  covering  105%  of  2  month\u2019s  projected  dues  to \n                                                \n30 Three of the five states crossed by the project have poverty levels above the national average of 26.1% \n(Chhattisgarh, 44%; Madhya Pradesh, 37.4%; and Uttar Pradesh, 31.2%). Transmission extension and efficiency  \ngains will indirectly enhance electricity access through the distribution network to end users, including the poor. \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 The project avoided routing transmission lines through environmentally sensitive areas. While the government \nexempted transmission projects from environmental clearances, POWERGRID will secure all necessary forest \nclearances prior to construction and installation, in accordance with the Forest Conservation Act 1980. \n33 None of the affected people will be physically relocated from their homes. However, two substations for the \nterminals will acquire about 102 acres of private land and impact 190 persons, 170 persons of whom (34 families) \nwill be significantly affected due to land loss. They will be duly compensated for their economic losses, in \naccordance with the specific entitlements, compensation rates, and livelihood restoration defined for the project. \n34 Initial Environmental Examination and Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). POWERGRID ensures contractor\u2019s liabilities for safeguards in bid documents and will submit progress reports \non safeguard implementation to ADB. \n35 POWERGRID has established its corporate environmental and social policy and procedures (ESPP), which is a \ncomprehensive environmental and social management system. The ESPP was developed in 1998 and revised in \n2009,  integrating  key  guidance  and  best  practices  from  the  World  Bank  through  a  multi-stakeholder  and \nparticipatory consultation process. \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) is based \non the project-specific level instead of the POWERGRID corporate level. \n37 In the event of an incurable default by a given offtaker, the BPTAs require that remaining customers are liable pro \nrata for making POWERGRID whole on transmission charges on a joint basis. ", "9 \nPOWERGRID. The large number of generators and offtakers to which POWERGRID is exposed \nprovides a diversification benefit from supply and sales arrangements, thus mitigating payment \nrisks. Since the above mechanisms were introduced, POWERGRID has not experienced a \ncustomer default.  \n \n31.  Completion risk. There are two types of completion risks: (i) delay in completion by \ngenerators while the transmission line is ready, and (ii) a completion delay by POWERGRID \nwhile the generators are ready to connect. POWERGRID is protected from the first risk by \nperformance bonds and transmission charge coverage under the BPTAs. Under the second \nrisk, POWERGRID is liable to generators for payment of liquidated damages equivalent to the \ntransmission charge only if POWERGRID cannot arrange an alternative route of evacuation. \nTypically, alternative transmission routes are available in the national grid network and very few \ntransmission projects of POWERGRID have been delayed beyond 1 year. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates that a 1-year delay of all projects in POWERGRID\u2019s development program would \nresult in limited impact on the company\u2019s financial position.38 POWERGRID and the generators \nregularly hold coordination meetings to harmonize progress on their respective projects. \n \n32.  Political and regulatory risk. POWERGRID\u2019s transmission tariffs and revenues are \ndefined  under  CERC  regulations.39 Because  the  framework  is  adjusted  every  5  years, \nPOWERGRID\u2019s revenues are subject to some uncertainty. Despite this, CERC has historically \nprovided reasonable adjustments and incentives to promote the stable performance of the \ntransmission sector to ensure a climate of sustainable investment and fiscal health in line with \nthe National Tariff Policy. As the designated central transmission utility, POWERGRID plays a \npivotal  role  in  national  transmission  system  planning,  grid  development,  and  stability  in \noperations. As a corporate entity, it invests in and operates transmission systems according to \ncommercial business principles. In POWERGRID\u2019s role as the country\u2019s central transmission \nutility, the government could in theory direct the public sector entity to undertake activities that \nmay be commercially disadvantageous but are deemed by government to be in the national \ninterest.  This  possibility  is  mitigated  by  the  fact  that,  as  a  publicly  traded  company, \nPOWERGRID must operate in compliance with requirements of the Securities Exchange Board \nof India under the listing rules of the national stock exchanges. In addition, since POWERGRID \nis a substantial source of dividends for the government, it is likely that the government will \ncontinue to support sound commercial operations for POWERGRID to maintain or increase the \nvalue of the government's shareholding. \n \n33.  Competitive risk. POWERGRID has participated as a minority joint venture party with \nprivate or other public utilities in nine projects. This reflects their partners\u2019 nascent skills in \nundertaking transmission activities and their consequent need to align with an experienced \nparty. POWERGRID\u2019s participation in these joint ventures has helped build its experience in a \ncompetitive environment. Per CERC order, some transmission projects are now subject to \ncompetitive bidding, and 14 projects have been selected by a CERC sanctioned committee to \ndate.40 In the future, as competition from the private sector increases, there is a possibility that \nthe company\u2019s role may be limited to pure transmission operations, which may affect its revenue \ngrowth and market share. Should this occur, however, POWERGRID\u2019s financial position would \n                                                \n38 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). One-year delay of all projects \nwould be an extreme scenario. \n39 Tariff regulations permit POWERGRID to pass through to customers, without need for any further regulatory \napproval, any increase in debt servicing cost due to changes in interest rates or exchange rates on foreign \ncurrency borrowing and increases in operating costs due to inflation or real price changes. Tariffs are determined \nbased on total final investment costs incurred to implement the project and are recovered via a fixed depreciation \nformula and a fixed return on equity. To date, the regulated tariff structures have adequately provided for recovery \nof all costs of investment and operations of transmission projects while providing a reasonable return on equity. \n40 To attract increased investment in interregional transmission from the private sector, the government issued tariff-\nbased competitive bidding guidelines with effect from January 2011. They provide two forms of private participation \nthrough joint ventures or independent private transmission companies. \n ", "10 \nbe maintained due to reduced capital expenditures in such a scenario. High barriers to entry in \nthe transmission business would also give POWERGRID the first-mover advantage and its wide \ntransmission network could mitigate competitive threats. While more competitively bid projects \nmay be promoted, stress testing under the corporate financial projection indicates that this is \nunlikely to have a material impact on POWERGRID\u2019s long-term financial performance.41 \n \n34.  The obligor risk rating for POWERGRID is NSO 5, equivalent to the sovereign. The \nnonsovereign facility risk rating is NSO 7, adjusted down two notches from the obligor risk rating \ndue to the proposed tenor of the loan.  Nonsovereign loan pricing will ensure recovery of ADB's \ncost  of  funds  plus  a  reasonable  margin  to  compensate  for  risk.  Margin  and  fees  will  be \nbenchmarked to market pricing. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n35.  The  government  and  POWERGRID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. The government \nand POWERGRID have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan and guarantee agreements for the proposed sovereign loan. \n \n36.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 42  the \nGovernment of India has confirmed that it has no objection to the proposed nonsovereign loan \nto POWERGRID. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by its Board of Directors. \n \n37.  The effectiveness of the sovereign loan will be subject to satisfaction of all requirements \nprecedent for disbursement under the nonsovereign loan. Likewise, the nonsovereign loan will \nbe disbursable upon satisfaction of all conditions for disbursements under the sovereign loan. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $500,000,000 to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, to be \nguaranteed by India, for the National Grid Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand guarantee agreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan of $250,000,000 to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, without \na sovereign guarantee, for the National Grid Improvement Project in India from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n9 September 2011 \n                                                \n41 The scenario assumed that 50% of future POWERGRID projects would be lost due to competition. \n42 ADB. 1966.
