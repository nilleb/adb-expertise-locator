The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (the  PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  the  preparation  of  the  Taiyuan-Zhongwei  Railway  Project  for  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing. ADB considered this request, and a fact-finding mission \nvisited the project area in January\u2013February 2005, carried out an initial poverty and social \nassessment  and  a  rapid  environmental  assessment,  and  discussed  technical  and \nsocioeconomic  issues  with  representatives  of  the  Government  and  provincial  and  local \ngovernments and the Ministry of Railways (MOR). This paper is based on the understanding \nreached by the Government and the mission on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA is \nincluded in ADB's country assistance program for 2005.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  From 1978, when economic reforms were introduced, to 2003, the PRC experienced \nsustained rapid economic growth. The PRC's exceptional economic performance continued in \n2004,  with  an  economic  growth  rate  of  9.5%.  Rapid  economic  growth  resulted  in  a  rapid \nincrease in demand for transportation. The annual growth during 1978\u20132003 of passenger \ntransport was 9.2%, and freight transport grew at 7.1%. In 2003, road traffic accounted for \n55.8% of total passenger-kilometers, followed by railways (with 34.7%), civil aviation (with \n9.1%), and coastal and inland waterways (with 0.5%). The modal split for freight ton-kilometers \nwas 53.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 32.0% for railways, 13.2% for roads, 1.4% for \npipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3.  Rapid economic growth led to a high demand for railway transportation, which is the \nprimary mode of transport for long-distance and bulk transport. Between 1978 and 2004, railway \nfreight grew from 535 billion ton-kilometers to 1,929 billion ton-kilometers, equivalent to an \nannual growth rate of 5.0%, while passenger traffic grew at 6.5% annually, increasing from \n109 billion passenger-kilometers to 571.2 billion passenger-kilometers. At the end of 2004, the \nPRC\u2019s  railway  system  comprised  74,400  route-kilometers.  Despite  such  growth  rates,  the \nrailway capacity lagged behind demand, due to railway system constraints. Given the railway\u2019s \nimportant  role  in  providing  economic  transportation,  these  constraints,  if  not  removed,  will \ncontinue  to  adversely  effect  efficient  economic  growth.  Because  of  these  concerns,  the \nGovernment  adopted  an  aggressive  plan  to  improve  the  railway  and  planned  network \nextensions and construction in underserved areas.  \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving efficiency by using new technology \nand modern management tools in planning and operation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies \nthrough appropriate pricing and commercialization of services, (v) initiating institutional and \nstructural  reforms  to  increase  MOR\u2019s  autonomy  and  accountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging \nnongovernment investment in infrastructure and related services.  \n \n5.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 kilometers of new lines to \nprovide access to unserved areas, with the network length reaching a total of 75,000 route-\nkilometers by 2005; (ii) constructing 3,000 kilometers of double lines and electrifying 5,000 \nkilometers of key lines to increase capacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 10 January 2005. \n \n ", " 2 \nkilometers, with high speeds being reached on the total length of 15,000 kilometers. The plan \nenvisages a total investment of CNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion for capital construction \nand CNY80 billion for rolling-stock acquisition for the railway sector. During 2003\u20132007, the \ninvestments for capital construction for the railway are expected to reach CNY450 billion.  \n \n6.  In 2004, the state council approved the new railway development plan, covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 72,000 kilometers to \n85,000  kilometers  by  2010  and  to  100,000  kilometers  by  2020.  Increasing  train  speed  is \nidentified as a major goal. Train speeds will be raised to over 200 kilometers per hour on the \ntrunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to the development of railways in unserved areas \nand regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. The route network length will \nincrease by 16,000 kilometers in the western region of the PRC, to reach a network length of \n40,000 kilometers by 2020. To improve operational efficiency, steps will be taken to separate \npassenger and freight trains on key rail corridors.  \n \n7.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nthe  World  Bank  and  ADB.  Since  1979,  Japan  provided  about  Y558  billion  for  15  railway \nprojects, to expand rail transportation capacity. Since 1984, the World Bank provided ten loans \ntotaling over $2.4 billion for (i) nine national railway projects, to expand railway capacity on high-\npriority corridors, modernize systemwide technology, and strengthen institutional capabilities, \nand (ii) one local railway project. ADB focused on the development of railways in less developed \ninland provinces, to promote growth and reduce poverty. ADB provided 12 loans, totaling about \n$2.2 billion, to finance the construction of about 1,921 kilometers of provincial railways operated \nby joint ventures with MOR and 4,138 kilometers of new railway lines under four national railway \nprojects. \n \n8.  ADB's operational strategy in the PRC focuses on (i) expanding the railway system in \nunserved less developed and poor areas, (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity of key \nroutes of the national railway system to improve transport efficiency, (iii) commercializing railway \noperations to sustain efficient operations, and (iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the \ntransport sector through restructuring and policy reform. The strategy will continue to focus on \nrailway development in underserved areas in poor interior provinces, to link lower income \nregions with growth centers, which will facilitate pro-poor growth, a prerequisite for reducing \npoverty. The policy issues addressed in the railway sector include corporatization, marketing \nand business development, and tariff setting with improved cost recovery. ADB enhanced policy \ndialogue with MOR and is providing technical assistance support for policy reforms to MOR.2 \nThis consultation will continue to further the reforms in the sector. \n \n9.  The Project envisages the construction of 975 kilometers of Class I electrified railway \nline  and  41  new  railway  stations.  The  railway  will  traverse  Shanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Ningxia \nprovinces, starting from Yuci (50 kilometers southeast of Taiyuan) in Shanxi, running west \nthrough the cities of Luiyan, Suide, Jingbian, and Dingbian, reaching its west end at Yinchuan \nand Zhongwei, in Ningxia Province in northwest PRC. The project impact area includes 16 \ncounties  and  cities  with  a  total  population  of  about  8.6  million  in  Taiyuan,  Luiyan,  Suide, \nLuiyang, Jingbian, Dingbian, Yinchuan, and Zhongwei. The total rural population is about 3.6 \nmillion, of which about 1.2 million people (33%) live below the poverty line, including those in \n1,960 poverty villages that do not have access to highways, electricity, telephone service, or \nwater that is potable. The Project will directly benefit a significant number of the poor, especially \nthrough the construction of 41 railway stations along the 975-kilometer route. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for World Trade Organization-Policy Reform \nSupport to the Ministry of Railways. Manila. \n ", "    3 \n10.  The  rationale  for  the  Project  reflects  a  need  to  (i)  develop  the  railway  network;  \n(ii) enhance capacity; (iii) reduce energy consumption and improve the environmental pollution \nsituation; (iv) meet the needs of the new railway development plan and the western region \ndevelopment strategy; and (v) promote pro-poor economic growth along the line and in the \nregion,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  The  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Beijing-\nGuangzhou,  Beijing-Wuhan,  and  Shanghai-Xuzhou  main  lines  in  the  east  and  Xi\u2019an-Baoji-\nChengdu and Xi\u2019an-Baoji-Lanzhou main lines in the west. The proposed line extends east to \nShangqiu and Xuzhou, connecting to the Jing-Hu and Jing-Jiu3 routes, and west to Baoji and \nLanzhou, connecting with the Jing-Lan routes and the Lan-Xin line. Moreover, the Project will \ncreate the shortest land route to Europe.  \n \n11.  The proposed Project is a missing link and, once complete, will provide connectivity to \nsome of the poorest areas of the PRC. The link provides the shortest western rail route from \nTaiyuan, Beijing, Harbin, Qingdao, and Dalian. No east-west railway links these three provinces, \nand the existing east-west railway line (Longhai railway line) is in Henan and Shanxi provinces, \nand the line is fully used. A Class II highway with limited passing capacity exists. As this line \nwould be electrified, the energy requirements would be small, and the effect on environmental \npollution would be minimal. The proposed Project would be a joint-venture railway project, with \nequity participation from the Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Ningxia provincial governments.  \n \n12.  The project area has large coal reserves; is rich in food grains and forest produce; has \nchemical, engineering, cement, and manufacturing industry; and has a number of tourist sites. \nThe proposed railway will pass through an alignment area that has remained cut off from \nmainstream  development,  due  to  lack  of  transportation  and  its  remote  location.  Poor \naccessibility and lack of economic transportation impeded economic growth in the resource rich \narea.  The  region  has  many  tourist  spots.  The  tourist  potential  is  enormous  and  can  be \nmaximized with the development of the railway line, as the line will provide economic, reliable, \nand safe transport that is much needed. The provincial and local governments and people living \nin the project area see the railway as a key investment, a necessary way to create employment \nand income-generating activities for the people in the region, and a prerequisite for reducing \npoverty.  \n \n13.  The Project will help develop the railroad network in an unserved area and enhance \neconomic growth. In addition, the Project is included in MOR\u2019s updated Tenth Five-Year Plan, \nas well as the railway development plan, and will support the Government\u2019s western region \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  proposed  railway  will  facilitate  economic  development  and \nintegration  of  the  poor  western  region  and  is  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and  natural \nresources  development  and  tourism  and  related  industries.  The  railway  will  increase  local \npeople\u2019s access to market and social services and give them an opportunity to improve their \nstandard  of  living.  Completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway  projects  show  that  such \nprojects create jobs in construction and loading and unloading operations, as well as other \nincome-generating  activities,  such  as  material  and  food  supply  and  small  services  around \nconstruction sites.4 The lower transportation costs after project completion will make goods and \nservices available at more economic prices to the people living in the area, including the poor, \nand provide them with opportunities to sell their produce to broader markets. The railway will \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997.

Manila.  \n4  In the ADB-financed Daxian-Waxian Railway Project, the average net income along the proposed alignment of the \nrailway increased by 25% in real terms during the construction period. The average real increase in Chongqing for \nthe same period was approximately 10%. Education is often the first spending priority for families. Because of an \nimproved cash position, some poor people are reportedly no longer indebted for school tuition for the next \ngeneration.

The \nProject is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy and will support the Government\u2019s \nstrategic policy objective of greater developmental emphasis on poor, interior, and underserved \nareas of the PRC by improving transportation links with growth centers. \n \n14.  The Project envisages the construction of a 975-kilometer Class I railway line with \nsubgrades, bridges, and tunnels. Because of the hilly topography along the Taiyuan-Zhongwei \nrailway route, tunnels and bridges will comprise 34% of the route length. \n \n15.  This is a national project and will be implemented by MOR. A feasibility study is being \nprepared, with cost estimates that reflect the current prices of materials and construction and \ntraffic forecasts. MOR advised ADB that the project proposal is expected to be approved by the \nNational Development Reforms Commission by May 2005. The feasibility study, environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA), and draft resettlement plan will be submitted to ADB by May 2005. \nThe provincial and local governments of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Ningxia provinces confirmed that \nall the counties affected implemented many projects involving resettlement. Resettlement under \nthe Project will be implemented as per the national laws and provincial regulations and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Output \n16.  The TA aims to (i) assist the Government in reviewing and strengthening the project \nfeasibility study, EIA, plan for resettlement, and related studies to meet ADB's requirements for \npossible financing; (ii) identify policy measures and institutional development needs that will \nimprove railway operational efficiency and management and ensure financial sustainability of \noperations; and (iii) identify the social dimensions to be incorporated in project design, including \nmeasures to enhance social development and reduce poverty in the project area. The output \nwill be the design of a project suitable for ADB financing. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The work under the TA will comprise: (i) review and strengthen the feasibility study to \nmeet ADB'  s requirements for (a) technical aspects related to construction and operation;  \n(b) economic and financial analyses, including a review of the traffic forecast and financial \nperformance of operation of the project facilities; and (c) financial management assessment, \nincluding a review of budgetary and planning control, financial and management accounting, \nand internal control and audit systems; (ii) develop a set of verifiable performance indicators, \nincluding socioeconomic and poverty, and a sustainable mechanism for monitoring during and \nbeyond  the  construction  stage;  (iii)  recommend  policy  measures  that  will  improve  railway \noperational efficiency and management and assess specific institutional development needs to \ncommercially operate the project facilities and ensure financial sustainability; (iv) review the \npotential  for  private  sector  participation  in  construction,  provision  of  services,  and  tourism \ndevelopment; (v) review and update the EIA report and prepare a summary EIA with appropriate \nenvironmental monitoring and management plans; (vi) review and refine the resettlement plan, \nso that involuntary resettlement will be consistent with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines; (vii) review \nthe initial poverty and social assessment; carry out a detailed poverty and social analysis, \nincluding a baseline socioeconomic profile of the population living in the project area; and \nprepare relevant mitigation and enhancement measures (Appendix 2); and (viii) undertake a \ndistribution analysis of the Project and associated developments on poverty reduction (including \npoverty impact). The key activities are field surveys; document review; data analysis; and \n ", "    5 \nconsultations with stakeholders, including government officials; project beneficiaries; and people \naffected, including ethnic minority groups and women and the poor. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $670,000 equivalent, comprising $372,000 in foreign \nexchange and $298,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 3). The Government \nrequested that ADB finance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$128,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. MOR will provide the remaining $170,000 equivalent in local currency cost \nfor counterpart staff members, office facilities, and support services and local communications. \nThe Government and MOR were advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinancing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will require about 39 person-months of consulting services (15 international and \nabout 24 domestic) spread over 5 months, including fieldwork. The consultants will be engaged \nby ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. A consulting firm will be selected and engaged following the quality and \ncost-based  selection  method,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  required.  The \ninternational consultants will have expertise in transport economics, traffic forecasting, railway \nengineering and operation, institution building, resettlement and social and poverty analysis. \nThese consultants will also have expertise in financial analysis, financial management, and \nenvironmental sciences. Expertise required from domestic consultants will be in the fields of \ntransport economics, railway engineering and operation, and resettlement and socioeconomics. \nEnvironmental engineering will also be an area of expertise. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms \nof reference for consulting services. The consultants will procure equipment in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n20.
