At the request of the Royal Government of Bhutan (the Government), the Fact-Finding \nMission from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) visited Bhutan from 23 September to 1 \nOctober 2002, to formulate technical assistance (TA) for the Industrial Estate and Dry Port \nDevelopment  Project.1  The  Mission  held  discussions  with  the  responsible  officials  of  the \nconcerned agencies, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF); Department of Aid and Debt \nManagement  (DADM);  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  (MTI);  Department  of  Trade  (DOT), \nDepartment of Industry (DOI); Department of Employment and Labor (DEL); Department of \nRevenue  and  Customs  (DRC);  the  National  Environmental  Commission  (NEC);  the  City \nCorporation of Phuentsholing; and the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), \nincluding representatives from the private sector. This TA was developed on the basis of \nunderstandings reached during the Mission. An initial poverty and social assessment for the \nproject is included in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan is a landlocked country in the Eastern Himalayas, covering approximately 46,500 \nsquare kilometers of mostly mountainous terrain. The population of Bhutan in 2000 was 677,934 \nwith a growth rate of 2.5%. Per capita gross national product in 2001 was $673.  \n \n3.  After a long history of government led-development, Bhutan's economy opened up to the \nprivate sector in the 1980s. Since then, the economy has steadily  transformed, with rapid \ngrowth  of  the  urban  centers,  the  development  of  basic  infrastructure  services,  and  the \ndevelopment of a prolific hydropower sector. In mid-2001, Bhutan had over 12,878 licensed \nindustrial businesses and 138 registered companies operating in a wide range of industries. \nHowever, reflecting the early stage of private sector development and the size of the overall \neconomy, roughly 80% of all firms in the country are cottage industries (with less than Nu1 \nmillion invested capital).  \n \n4.  The Government is increasingly looking at the private sector as the main engine for \neconomic development, and as the vehicle to generate employment opportunities for the rapidly \ngrowing number of educated Bhutanese youth. Reflecting this thrust, Bhutan's Ninth Plan \n(2002\u20132007), launched in July 2002, has established private sector development as one of the \nGovernment's strategic focus areas. As part of the Government's effort to stimulate private\u2013 \nsector-led growth in the economy, two key initiatives have been given highest priority: (i) the \nconstruction of a new dry port near the Indian border in Phuentsholing, and (ii) the development \nof  a  new  107  hectare  industrial  estate  in  Pasakha  (approximately  14  kilometers  from \nPhuentsholing).  \n \n5.  Bhutan depends heavily on  trade with India, the source of about 85% of Bhutan's \ninternational  trade.  In  terms  of  volume,  trade  with  India  totaled  625,529  tons  in  1997.  \nPhuentsholing, in the southwest of Bhutan, is the transit point for about 81% of Bhutan\u2019s \ninternational trade. The total volume of cargo imported through Phuentsholing in 1997 was \nestimated at 600,000 tons. However, due to the limited road infrastructure and cargo handling \ncapacity within Bhutan, virtually all cargo is transported in 3-4 ton trucks. There are significant \ninefficiencies due to breakage, pilferage, loading and unloading costs, etc., caused by the need \ntransport cargo in small consignments. Containerized cargo, imported from countries other than \nIndia, is typically cleared in Kolkata (a major port in eastern India) and then transported to \nBhutan. A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study estimated the total port \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, (internet edition) on 14 October 2002. \n ", "2    \nclearance time at 5 days on average in 1999, due to inefficiencies in handling and customs \nprocedures.  \n \n6.  For Bhutan, a dry port facility equipped with appropriate cargo handling and storage \nfacilities under customs control with associated capabilities for clearing and forwarding goods, \nwarehousing, transshipment, and transit, is essential to facilitate cross-border trade. This type of \nport will provide the same facilities as a seaport but from a land-locked location. A dry port, \ntogether with efficient customs clearance procedures, will substantially reduce transaction time \nat the Bhutan-India gate in Phuentsholing, and at the Kolkata port. Both the Government and \nthe  private  sector  of  Bhutan  place  great  priority  on  the  development  of  a  dry  port  in \nPhuentsholing to increase trade with India and other countries. The South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation (SASEC) working group, financed by ADB, has also strongly endorsed \nsuch a development as a high priority investment for the region. The Government has identified \na 2.9 hectare site near the Bhutan-India gate for the project.  \n \n7.  Industrial development in Bhutan is severely constrained by a lack of industrial sites with \nbasic infrastructure. It is practically impossible for individual industries to bear the costs of \ninfrastructure development, given the high construction costs associated with the difficult terrain \nand poor access. Recognizing this constraint, the Government, in 2000, identified five sites for \ndevelopment into industrial estates in strategic locations, of which two have been prioritized for \ndevelopment during the Ninth Plan Period. Among them is a 107 hectare site acquired by the \nGovernment at Pasakha, strategically located 14 kilometers from Phuentsholing, along the new \nThimphu-Phuentsholing highway that is under construction.  \n \n8.  Because of its proximity to India, Bhutan's principal trading partner, Phuentsholing has \ndeveloped as one of the primary industrial nodes in the country. At present, there is a 25 \nhectare industrial estate in Phuentsholing, which is fully occupied. Several other industries \nranging from cement manufacturing, to wood products, to carbonated beverages, are in and \naround Phuentsholing. However, the limited availability of reasonably flat, developable, and \nserviced land has stalled the development of Phuentsholing's industrial sector. Initial market \nsurveys demonstrate sufficient demand from the private sector for the industrial estate at \nPasakha. The project will stimulate industrial investment and lead to reduced poverty and \nincreased economic growth in Bhutan.  \n  \n9.  For the industrial estate and the dry port to be operationally viable, the Government \nneeds  to  create  the  required  environment  and  attract  private  entrepreneurs  to  establish \noperations at the two project sites. This will require an appropriate legal framework and clear \nand  transparent  rules  and  regulations  to  support  market-oriented  industrial  and  trade \ndevelopment in line with national objectives. Government regulations and business practices \nneed to be systematized in a structured, phased, and consistent manner to enable the private \nsector to operate effectively.  Development responsibilities for the trade and industry sectors \nrest with MTI. Within MTI, DOI assumes the administrative responsibilities and is responsible for \nformulating development plans and establishing the appropriate legal framework to promote the \nindustrial  sector,  including  small-scale  industrial  activities.  Similarly,  DOT,  within  MTI,  is \nresponsible for developing Bhutan\u2019s trade sector and the regulatory and administrative systems \nfor domestic commercial activities and cross-border trade. DOT is also responsible for preparing \nthe economy and the country\u2019s trade and industrial sectors for Bhutan\u2019s integration into the \nregional  and  global  economy  and  later  into  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO).  The \nresponsibility for developing the industrial estates will rest with DOI while that of the dry port will \nbe with DOT. \n ", "      3\n10.  At present, the industrial sector is operating under the General Guidelines for Industrial \nand Commercial Ventures in Bhutan, 1997. However, the country does not have an established \nlegal framework or supporting rules and regulations for the sector. A draft business licensing act \nhas been prepared and is scheduled for legislation by June 2003. Under the provisions of the \nproposed act, MTI will need to consolidate and frame rules and regulations for business \nactivities in Bhutan. Bhutan's Foreign Investment Policy has recently been endorsed by the \nCoordination Committee of the Council of Ministers and will form the guidelines for foreign \ninvestment until it is legislated.  \n \n11.  All import and export activities involving cross-border trade are currently governed by the \nSales Tax, Customs, and Excise Act (2000), and related regulations framed in 2001. Bhutan \nenjoys a tariff free trade agreement with India, which is due to expire in 2005. The rules and \nregulations must be revised to streamline cross-border trade operations. The draft export import \npolicy may also need to be refined.  \n \n12.  Environmental compliance guidelines have been framed for some sectors, including \nindustry,  with  ADB  support.  The  Environmental  Assessment  Act  (2000),  together with the \nregulations  issued  by  the  National  Environment  Commission,  provides  the  basis  for \nenvironmental clearance of development projects. The draft labor administration policy2 is \nexpected to be approved by the Cabinet at the soonest possible. A draft employment and labor \nact is being prepared for legislation in 2004 (footnote 2), but some rules and regulations have \nbeen framed for the interim period. The draft acts, rules, and regulations related to environment \nand labor policy may need to be reviewed, and potential issues identified, to establish the \nviability of the proposed dry port and industrial estate.  \n \n13.  In addition to the economic need and justification for Bhutan, the development of the \nnew industrial estate and dry port is expected to provide economic benefits to India. Of the \napproximately 60,000 people currently formally employed in Bhutan, approximately 50% are \nforeign nationals, mostly from India. Due to the lower cost and higher skill levels of labor from \nIndia, this trend is likely to continue in the short term. Increased industrial activity and cross-\nborder trade through the industrial estates and dry port will lead to increased (i) demand for \nskilled labor from India, (ii) demand for raw materials from India for industrial production, (iii) \nfreight movement between India and Bhutan, and (iv) throughput at Kolkata port.  \n \n14.  ADB is the only international development agency currently active in the trade and \nindustry sectors of Bhutan.3 The Government is fully committed to the development of the dry \nport and industrial estate, and has strong support for the effort from the private sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n15.  The primary purpose of the TA is to assist the Government in developing the proposed \nindustrial estate and dry port in the Phuentsholing region. The TA will also help the government \ncreate the required environment by establishing an appropriate legal framework and clear and \ntransparent rules and regulations. The final output of the TA will provide the basis for a \nsubsequent ADB investment in both the industrial estate and the dry port, which, together with \nassociated policy reforms, will facilitate subregional economic cooperation.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Bhutan for Institutional Development of the Department of Employment and \nLabor. Manila. \n3  In 1998, UNDP carried out a feasibility study for a dry-port in Phuentsholing, but unfortunately, the site selected \nwas completely washed away during a recent flood. UNDP is no longer active in the sector.  \n ", "4    \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will have three distinct, yet interrelated components: (i) the development of the \nindustrial estates, (ii) development of the dry port, and (iii) analysis of the policy and regulatory \nenvironment in the trade and industrial sectors.  \n \n17.  To determine the feasibility of the industrial estates, the TA will (i) assess the current and \nprojected land and infrastructure needs of the industries to be developed in the industrial \nestates; (ii) develop the design, master plan, and layout for the industrial estates and associated \ninfrastructure; (iii) conduct demand assessments, projections, and willingness-to-pay surveys for \nthe infrastructure services to be developed at the industrial estate sites; (iv) conduct an initial \nenvironmental  examination  and  social  analysis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nrecommend appropriate mitigation measures where necessary; and (v) carry out economic and \nfinancial analysis for the project.  \n \n18.  The feasibility assessment and design of the dry port will (i) forecast international trade \ncargo traffic flows for 20 years via Phuentsholing; (ii) identify the required common infrastructure \nfor the dry port; (iii) prepare a layout plan for the dry port and recommend feasible access road \nalignments; (iv) recommend improved customs clearance and documentation procedures; (v) \nprepare an initial environmental examination and social analysis in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nguidelines and recommend mitigation measures where necessary; and (vi) carry out economic \nand financial analysis for the Project. \n   \n19.  The assessment of the regulatory environment will (i) review the policies and guidelines \nrelated  to  the  trade  and  industry  sectors  to  identify  critical  constraints  to  private  sector \ndevelopment (ii) help to establish an appropriate legal framework and recommend rules and \nregulations  to  support  private  sector  growth  (iii)  establish  management  authorities  for  the \noperations and maintenance of the industrial estate and dry port and (iv) establish clear and \ntransparent procedures for private sector participation in the operations of the two facilities.  \n \n20.  All activities will be carried out in close collaboration with pertinent Government agencies \nand the private sector. An effort will also be made to create strong linkage between ADB's \neducation and skills development projects4, especially with regard to the types of industries to \nbe promoted in the industrial estate. Descriptions of the activities to be carried out during the TA \nare included in the outline terms of reference for consulting services in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $825,000 equivalent of which $599,000 will be \nforeign exchange costs, and $226,000 equivalent will be local currency costs.  ADB will finance \n$700,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange costs and $101,000 equivalent \nin  local  currency  costs.  The  remaining  $125,000  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \nGovernment  and  will  include  office  accommodation,  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff, \ntransportation, surveys, and workshops. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nprogram. The Government has been informed that ADB\u2019s financing of the TA does not commit \nADB to financing a subsequent loan project. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 3.  \n \n                                                 \n4  See footnote 2. Also, ADB. 2001.

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  MTI will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Implementing Agency will be the Policy \nand Planning Division within MTI. MTI will set up a TA implementing unit, appoint a manager for \nthe  unit,  and  provide  office  space,  furniture,  equipment,  and  counterpart  staff  for  the  TA \nconsultants as necessary. DOT and DOI will provide counterpart technical staff to the TA \nconsultants as required. The Government will set up a technical assistance steering committee \n(TASC), under the chairmanship of the director general, DADM, to periodically review progress \nof the TA and resolve any issues that may arise. The TASC will meet at least once every 2 \nmonths. In addition to DADM, the TASC will include representatives from DEL, DOI, DOT, DRC, \nMTI, NEC, Ministry of Communications, National Technical Training Authority, and others as \nnecessary. All representatives in the TASC will be at least director level officials. \n \n23.  The TA will be carried out over 6 months, beginning around June 2003. The consulting \nteam will include nine international  consultants (23 person-months total) and six domestic \nconsultants (13 person-months total). All consultants will be selected and engaged through a \nfirm following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal format \nand the quality-and cost-based selection method will be used.  \n \n24.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports,  summarizing  project \nactivities, issues, and constraints, throughout the duration of the TA. In addition, four major \nreports will be submitted. An inception report will be submitted no later than 3 weeks after \nfielding of the consultants. A midterm report will be submitted 3 months after TA inception, and a \ndraft final report will be submitted 5 months after inception. The Government and ADB will \nprovide comments on the draft final report. The final report will be submitted within 3 weeks after \nreceiving comments from the review. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof Bhutan for preparing the  Industrial Estate and Dry Port Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, will be \nsubject to the reimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations5 and \nStreamlining of Technical Assistance Operations.6 If the technical assistance results in an ADB \nloan, ADB may charge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the balance that \nexceeds $250,000 equivalent.  \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1977.

The review of the \npolicy environment will ensure maximum use of Bhutanese labor in all facilities, that women have equal access to \nopportunities for employment and investment, and that workers' social needs are fully taken into consideration. \nBesides generating employment, development of the industrial estate will result in increased availability of lower cost \ndomestically produced goods throughout Bhutan. \n \nThe dry port component of the project, combined with streamlined customs and freight handling procedures between \nPhuentsholing and Kolkata, is expected to increase the volume of international trade. The increased efficiency in \ncargo handling will also result in significant savings to importers, which will in turn be passed on to consumers as the \nprices of imported goods are likely to fall.

The consulting team will comprise nine international and six domestic consultants. Each \nconsultant is required to work collectively with the team in developing all outputs. The specific \ntechnical  tasks  associated  with  each  consultant  are  outlined  here,  and  the  required \nqualifications for each consultant are indicated in Supplementary Appendix A. The team leader \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB) project officer, however, may augment the tasks outlined \nas required to comply with ADB guidelines and procedures, and to improve the quality of the \noverall Project. The tasks are to be carried out in close cooperation with the Government, and \nextensive consultation is needed to ensure transfer of knowledge and full ownership of the \nprocesses and documents by the concerned government agencies. \n \nA.  Industrial Estate and Dry Port Planner and Team Leader  \n(international, 4 person- months) \n \n2.  The team leader, will organize and manage the consulting team and coordinate the \noverall technical assistance (TA). He or she will coordinate the preparation of all documentation \nrequired  by  ADB  guidelines  and  the  ADB  project  officer  to  develop  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President document for the ensuing loan, including (i) a detailed project \nlogical framework; (ii) project performance monitoring and evaluation arrangements, including \nbaseline  data;  and  (iii)  an  assessment  of  the  detailed  procurement  and  implementation \narrangements.  The  team  leader  will  be  accountable  for  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  all \ndeliverables, and will ensure that all components are clearly and concisely documented to the \nfull satisfaction of the ADB project team. The team leader will also be responsible for ensuring \nthat the proposed investment that will be prepared through the TA is complete, cohesive, \neconomically  and  financially  viable,  and  in  full  compliance  with  all  pertinent  ADB  and \nGovernment policies and guidelines.  \n \n3.  Specific tasks related to the industrial estate will include the following: \n \n(i)  Assess the current and projected land and infrastructure needs of the industries \nto be developed in the industrial estate; the land requirements for all necessary \ninfrastructure and support facilities; and the willingness to pay for the water \nsupply,  sanitation,  power  supply,  solid  waste  management,  and  other \ninfrastructure services to be developed at the site. This assessment will focus on \nthe projected mix of industries at the site during the first 10 years of operation.  \n(ii)  Develop a detailed structural master plan for the industrial estate, which clearly \ndefines  the  infrastructure  to  be  provided  by  the  Government,  and  the  land \nallocation strategy. The plan should consider all projected land requirements, \nflexibility and efficiency in land allocation, topography, access requirements, and \nnecessary land allocation for common infrastructure and amenities. The plan \nshould  clearly  define  a  phasing  strategy,  based  on  realistic  projections  of \ndemand. The objective is to finance the infrastructure necessary to make the first \nphase of the industrial estate operational. Therefore, the phasing strategy and \nplanning effort must incorporate all cost and technical data and make realistic \nplans for a first phase that can be completely financed with the funds available.  \n \n4.  Work related to the dry port will include the following: \n \n(i)  Carry out a 20 year traffic forecast for international trade cargo passing through \nPhuentsholing. Include (a) export cargo to India, (b) import cargo from India, (c) \nexport cargo to third countries through Kolkata Port, and (d) import cargo from \nthird  countries  through  Kolkata  Port.  The  traffic  forecast  should  include  the ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nvolume of cargo in weight and size, and number of vehicles used to transport the \ncargo in Bhutan and India.  \n(ii)  Examine if the existing access road to the dry port is sufficient given the number \nand types of vehicles that will be used. Recommend options for improving access \nto  the  site,  if  necessary,  through  traffic  regulations  or  the  identification  of \nalternative routes.  \n(iii)  Identify  required  facilities  including  stacking  yard,  parking  area,  warehouses, \noffice buildings, lighting systems, and equipment for handling cargo, particularly \nfor containers. Prepare a layout plan of the dry port and the access road, and its \nalternatives if identified. Prepare an implementation schedule for civil works and \nprovision of equipment. \n \nB.  Economist and Financial Analyst (international, 3 person-months) \n \n(i)  Guide  the  overall  development  of  the  project  and  work  closely  with  each \nconsultant on the team to ensure that each component is developed to meet all \npertinent  ADB  and  Government  criteria  and  guidelines.  Consider  potential \nsynergies with other ADB projects, as well as initiatives by the Government and \nother development agencies.  \n(ii)  Based  on  assessments  of  the  overall  financial  envelope  of  the  project, \nrecommend lease rates for the land, as well as tariff structures for infrastructure \nand management services to be provided at the industrial estate. All efforts must \nbe  made  to  develop  all  facilities  on  a  full  cost-recovery  basis.  Government \nsubsidies should only be considered as a last option.  \n(iii)  In coordination with the overall team, ensure that all proposed solutions are \naffordable to the Government and the private sector, economically and financially \nsound, and sustainable given the resource constraints in the country. Pay close \nattention to the suitability of the technology options and associated costs to the \ncontext of Bhutan. \n(iv)  In  coordination  with  the  overall  team,  develop  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing  plans;  identify  and  estimate  financial  benefits  of  the  dry  port  and \nindustrial estate operations; and conduct financial and economic analysis for \neach project component and for the overall project. The analyses will quantify \nproject  benefits  such  as  price  reductions  of  imported  goods  due  to  lower \ntransportation costs, and increased availability of locally manufactured goods, \nincreased  employment  opportunities  at  various  skill  levels.  Financial  and \neconomic analyses will be performed in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor the Financial Management and Governance of Investment Projects Financed \nby the Asian Development Bank and Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects. The economic analysis should include a quantitative analysis of risk, in \nline with ADB's Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in the Economic Analysis \nof Projects. \n(v)  Prepare a poverty impact assessment that illustrates the impact of the dry port \nand industrial estate on poverty reduction, in accordance with ADB's Handbook \non Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects.
