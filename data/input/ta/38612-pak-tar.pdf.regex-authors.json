Improving governance and preventing corruption are strategic priorities for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) under the Medium-Term Strategy II. ADB\u2019s governance interventions \ngive priority to public financial management, as well as to legal and regulatory frameworks and \ncapacity development in those sectors and subsectors where it is active. ADB is working with \nother  multilateral  development  banks  to  develop  a  uniform  framework  for  preventing  and \ncombating  fraud  and  corruption.  ADB  supports  national  and  subnational  government \ngovernance initiatives where there is demand and ADB has significant operations in national \nand subnational governments. At the Government\u2019s request, ADB has been providing support in \nPakistan  to  (i)  justice  sector  reforms  through  the  Access  to  Justice  Program  (AJP);  (ii) \ndevolution  reforms  through  the  Decentralization  Support  Program  (DSP)  and  provincial \nDevolved Social Services Programs (DSSPs); (iii) public financial management reforms through \nprovincial  public  resource  management  programs  in  Punjab  and  Balochistan;  and  (iv) \naccountability, transparency, and anticorruption through support to the National Accountability \nBureau (NAB).  \n \n2.  It  was  agreed  with  the  Government  that  the  TA  cluster  (TAC)  modality  would  be \nappropriate to provide flexible programmatic support to a range of demand-driven governance \ninterventions in the Government\u2019s priority governance and to foster policy dialogue on related \nissues. The TA cluster will enable the Government to advance the crosscutting governance \ntheme, including support to reforms and capacity building, across the spectrum of governance \ndomains. It will allow ADB to provide subprojects to various entities, with clear foci on their \nrespective  areas  of  responsibility,  and  yet  link  these  closely  within  the  overall  framework \nprovided  under  the  cluster.  The  TAC  will  support  the  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II), including support to preparation of \ngovernance, institutional, and corruption risk assessments and risk management plans. In line \nwith the Government\u2019s reform priorities, four areas for support have been agreed between ADB \nand the Government: justice sector, devolution, public financial management, and accountability \nand  transparency.  A  performance  and  learning  cell  (PLC)  will  be  established  to  review \nperformance, distill lessons learned, and disseminate results to interested stakeholders. \n   \n3.  Given the strong support for reform and keen interest expressed by the ministries of law \nand finance, as well as the NAB and Punjab planning and development department in their \nrespective  subclusters,  agreement  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  and  financing  arrangements  was  reached  with  the  Economic  Affairs \nDivision in November 2006.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n4.  One  of  the  four  pillars  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper2 is \nimproving  governance  and  consolidating  devolution  as  a  means  of  better  developing  and \nensuring social and economic justice. It also argues that poverty is \u201chighly conditioned\u201d by \ngovernance factors and that to address the \u201cgovernance deficit\u201d there must be commitment to \nfundamental  transformations  that  include  devolution  of  power,  decentralization,  improved \naccess to justice at the local level, transparency, and accountability. These issues are further \ndiscussed below in the context of the subclusters proposed for the TAC. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 March 2005. \n2  Ministry of Finance. 2003. Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty: The Road Ahead, Pakistan \nPoverty Reduction Strategy. Islamabad. \n ", "2   \n \n \nA.  Justice Sector  \n \n5.  Lack of expeditious and inexpensive access to justice has caused the poor in Pakistan \ndisproportionately to consume their scarce resources for dispute resolution and to claim their \nentitlements, thus exacerbating their poverty and vulnerability. Under the Local Government \nOrdinance (LGO) 2001, it is mandated that musalihat anjumans3 be established in each union \nas an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to shorten the time to resolve disputes, lower \nthe  costs  involved,  and  reduce  the  workload  of  the  courts.  LGO  2001  further  prescribes \nestablishment of district ombudsman offices in every district (in addition to provincial and federal \nombudsman  offices)  where  citizens  can  take  complaints  against  public  servants  in  local \ngovernment  (including  elected  representatives).  The  offices,  however,  have  not  yet  been \nestablished in most districts.  \n \n6.  According to the 2002 national baseline survey of 57,321 households by the National \nReconstruction Bureau,4 only 22% of households would approach the police to report a matter \nof personal safety and just 25% for a threat to property. Nationally, only 12% of households \nreported any contact with the police during the 5 years prior to the survey. Women and the most \nvulnerable  are  the  least  likely  to  approach  the  police.  The  Police  Order  2002  is  the  key \nlegislation  driving  reform  of  police  services.  It  has  introduced  many  reforms,  including  to \nestablish new institutions to oversee accountability and transparency of policing operations. The \nmain objectives of Police Order 2002 are to (i) establish a professional and efficient service that \nis able to detect crime and ensure public order, (ii) reduce political interference in the policing \nfunction, and (iii) establish a service that is accountable and operates within the rule of law. \n \n7.  The National Reconstruction Bureau\u2019s survey further found that nationally only 46% \nthought the courts were there to help them, and just 8% had any contact with the courts during \nthe 5 years prior to the survey. Respondents reported that (i) one needs money to engage with \nthe courts, (ii) courts do not provide justice, (iii) courts are not helpful, (iv) the courts did not \ncontact them, and (v) the court process takes too long. The main issues identified in the poverty \nreduction strategy paper concerning the judiciary are case management, the need to reduce \ndelays, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of court automation, all of which are being addressed \nthrough ADB\u2019s Access to Justice Program. \n \n8.  In December 2001, ADB approved a $350 million loan package to the Government of \nPakistan  in  support  of  justice  sector  reform  in  the  areas  of  judiciary,  public  safety,  legal \nempowerment and education, administrative justice, and fiscal reform (the AJP). The $330 \nmillion  program  loan,  including  a  $25  million  endowment  fund,  was  supplemented  by  two \nfunding modalities to support capacity required to effectively achieve the policy actions and \nthereby  contribute  to  the  justice  sector  reforms.  These  were  (i)  a  $20  million  technical \nassistance (TA) loan, and (ii) advisory technical assistance. In December 2004, a TA grant was \napproved to support police reforms in four districts in Punjab province. The endowment, called \nthe Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF), was designed to provide sustainable annual \nfunding for reform activities of the judiciary.  \n \n                                                 \n3   Musalihat anjumans (conciliation committees), provided for under Chapter XI of the provincial Local Government \nOrdinance(s) 2001, are bodies mandated to achieve out of court amicable settlement of disputes among the people \nthrough mediation, conciliation, and/or arbitration. \n4  National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan. 2003. Baseline Survey 2002, National Report: Social \nAudit of Governance and Delivery of Public Services. Islamabad (pp. 55\u201357). \n ", "  3\n9.  After  signing  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding  in  May  2006,  implementation \narrangements for the AJP were devolved to the provinces to address slow utilization of the TA \nloan. The current TA grant resources supporting the AJP are expected to be exhausted by \nFebruary 2007. The Ministry of Law and implementing agencies will need further technical \nassistance to (i) complete and consolidate the policy actions under the AJP program loan; (ii) \ndesign capacity building initiatives under the AJP TA loan, monitor implementation, and ensure \nquality of consultant outputs; and (iii) consolidate capacity building support to the AJDF to \nensure sustainability of management and operational arrangements in the future.  \n \n10.  The focus under the AJP to date has been on strengthening justice sector institutions. A \nchallenge for the future is to institutionalize justice reforms by engaging civil society in creating \nan informed and articulate constituency. Organized elements of civil society\u2014including the \npolicy research institutions; such statutory bodies as local justice committees, public safety \ncommissions, and dispute resolution bodies; political parties; the legal profession represented \nby bar associations and councils; law schools; and rights advocacy groups\u2014are critical to \nembedding reforms under the AJP. The provinces (Punjab and Balochistan, in particular) have \nexpressed keen interest in a second generation of justice sector reforms, and they have clear \nideas about future priorities. \n \nB.  Devolution  \n \n11.  Prior to implementing LGO 2001, development, social regulation, and service delivery \nwere directly administered by the provinces through the bureaucracies at the division, district, \nand tehsil5 levels. Deputy commissioners held important executive and judicial authority. There \nwas little scope for elected representatives or the public to participate in local administration. \nCivil servants were not answerable to the public, and therefore there was little incentive for them \nto ensure high-quality service delivery.  \n12.  Under devolution, in principle, citizens are empowered to participate, in concert with \naccountable elected local representatives, in decision making about public resource allocations. \nLocal government reforms are intended to promote citizens\u2019 voice in how priorities for delivery of \nbasic  social,  economic,  administrative,  and  political  entitlements  are  determined.  Local \ngovernments\u2014appropriately  empowered,  staffed  and  resourced\u2014are  expected  to  deliver \nimproved  quality  of  public  services.  LGO  2001  assigns  clear  powers,  responsibilities,  and \nservice delivery functions to three levels of local government: district, tehsil, and union. Districts \nare  responsible  for  delivering  primary  health,  education,  and  social  welfare.  Tehsils  are \nresponsible for water, sanitation, and urban services. Unions are responsible for birth and death \nregistrations, small municipal infrastructure projects, and parks.  \n \n13.  The provincial finance commissions (PFCs), established under the LGO, are statutory \nbodies  responsible  for  establishing  grant  systems  for  intergovernmental  transfers  to  local \ngovernments  in  each  province.  Local  governments  have  distinct  revenue  and  expenditure \nassignments,  but  they  have  differing  rural-urban  population  patterns  and  varying  levels  of \ndevelopment. Intergovernmental transfer systems, therefore, need to address horizontal and \nvertical imbalances across and between tiers of local government. Technical capacity of the \nPFCs needs to be further improved to enable these bodies to carry out their functions effectively. \n \n                                                 \n5  A tehsil is a local administrative unit equivalent to a sub district and is notified under the provincial Land Revenue \n \nAct(s). A district in Pakistan comprises one or more tehsils.\n ", "4   \n14.  Provincial local government commissions are responsible to conduct annual and special \ninspections and audits of local governments, as well as to resolve conflicts between local \ngovernments and province departments. Made up mainly of provincial government officials and \nappointees, such a commission is not widely perceived as a neutral body adjudicating between \nprovincial and local governments. Rather it is seen more as a tool of the provincial government.  \n \n15.  Vertical programs6 represent a major issue that has been identified by the Government. \nThe draft poverty reduction strategy paper II notes that a detailed review of donor projects in \nPakistan shows that most projects are not compliant with LGO 2001. A parallel system of \nplanning, approving, and implementing schemes has been introduced that undermines the \nlegally notified framework. It is also perceived that vertical programs distort the PFC award by \ntransferring large amounts of resources in a discretionary manner. A \u201cDevolution Compliance \nAction Plan\u201d is proposed to ensure that all donor supported programs and projects comply with \nprovisions of the Constitution and laws of the country, LGO 2001, and Police Order 2002.  \n \n16.  ADB has been supporting the Government\u2019s devolution reform efforts through the DSP, \napproved in November 2002 and comprising (i) a program loan of $270 million, (ii) a technical \nassistance loan for local government performance enhancement (1937-PAK) of $23 million, (iii) \na technical assistance loan for gender and governance mainstreaming (1938-PAK) of $7 million, \nand (iv) advisory TA grants totaling $6 million. ADB also supports province-led devolved social \ndevelopment  programs.  Sindh  DSSP  ($220  million),  approved  in  2003,  aims  to  improve \ngovernance and financing of social services in Sindh. Punjab DSSP ($200 million), approved in \n2004, is aimed at achieving progress on the Millennium Development Goals related to poverty, \ngender, education, health, and water and sanitation services. Balochistan DSSP ($205 million), \napproved in 2005, has the objective to improve governance and financing of social services. \n \n17.  Potential new devolution initiatives are emerging to complement DSP and DSSPs, such \nas federal to provincial devolution and devolution in urban large city districts. Now, 5 years into \nthe Government\u2019s devolution reform agenda, it would be useful to begin to assess the impact of \npolitical,  administrative,  and  fiscal  devolution  and  to  review  the  synergies  between  ADB\u2019s \ndevolution programs (AJP, DSP, DSSP) and the public resource management programs.  \n \nC.  Public Financial Management \n \n18.  Pakistan\u2019s budget development is based on well-defined timetables in the federal and \nprovincial  governments.  However,  budget  formulation  is  largely  incremental  with  a  lack  of \nattention  to  expenditure  prioritization  and  operational  efficiency.  Rigidities  in  expenditure \nstructures, absence of a performance orientation, insufficient coverage of development projects \nand public enterprises, and uneven quality and classification of accounts are some of the \nweaknesses hindering budget management processes at federal and provincial levels. Budget-\nrelated discussions between governments and the public vary. At the federal level, pre-budget \nseminars are held by the Ministry of Finance in the federal and provincial capitals, where private \nsector,  academic,  and  nongovernment  organizations  representatives  attend.  There  is  no \ngovernment feedback, however, as to how inputs from these seminars have been incorporated. \nDiscussions on provincial budgets, which account for about 80% of national expenditures on \nsuch key service areas as education, health, agriculture and irrigation, and public works, are \nmore limited. Budget deliberations between Parliament and the public are infrequent.  \n                                                 \n6  In the context of the LGO (2001), \u201cvertical programs\u201d are defined as those development programs dealing with local \ngovernment functions as specified in the provincial LGOs but that are either executed or controlled by the federal or \nprovincial government or other agencies in contradiction to the authority granted by the LGO (2001). \n ", "  5\n \n19.  There is a need to improve predictability of fund flows to spending units. Off-budget \naccounts and other shortcuts have emerged to speed up funds to essential programs, but these \nirregular practices decrease the government\u2019s ability to accurately track and report on fund \nusage and related outcomes. Unpredictable budget execution severely limits financial reporting \nand accountability frameworks.  \n \n20.  Accounting, financial reporting, and internal controls are generally inadequate due to \ninaccurate  and  incomplete  data  below  the  federal  level.  Accounting  skills  of  staff,  internal \ncontrols, processes, and infrastructure are weak. Accounting and financial reporting does not \nconform to international public sector standards. The internal control audit function does not \ncurrently exist. Capacity in Punjab and Sindh is relatively stronger than in other provinces. \n \n21.  External audit skills and infrastructure are generally uneven. There is a shortage of staff \nwith adequate skills, especially in certification audits. Although audit quality has improved over \nthe past 3 years, the Auditor General\u2019s reports on the annual accounts are heavily qualified and \nrefer  to  many  breaches  of  financial  regulations  and  controls.  The  vision  to  move  beyond \ncompliance  auditing  to  systems  and  performance  auditing  depends  upon  establishing  and \nimplementing appropriate performance-based management systems and accurate recording of \ninformation in an IT-based environment. \n \n22.  Legislative oversight has been effective when public accounts committees have been \nfunctional, but long breaks in the accountability cycle have resulted in backlogs of pending audit \nreports. There is still a need for building awareness, information sharing, and strengthening \ntechnical capacity of legislative review committees through capacity building programs at federal \nand provincial levels to improve legislative scrutiny. Public accounts committee oversight should \nbe enhanced through informed legislative debate and formal executive response to its reports. \n \n23.  ADB, in collaboration with the World Bank, Department for International Development \n(DFID) and the European Union, is seeking to adopt a more streamlined approach to public \nfinancial  management  (PFM)  performance  measurement  that  could  form  the  basis  of  joint \ndonor-government harmonized dialogue on the PFM reform agenda. In March 2006, ADB and \nits development partners agreed to collaborate in carrying out PFM accountability assessments \nand  public  procurement  assessments  at  the  federal  level  and  in  the  four  provinces.  PFM \naccountability  assessments  will  adopt  the  June  2005  Public  Expenditure  Financial \nAccountability measurement framework, 7 and the public procurement assessment will apply the \nOECD-DAC baseline indicators for procurement performance. \n \n24.  ADB has been supporting public resource management in two provinces. In Punjab, the \nPunjab  Resource  Management  Program  (Cluster  Program  I  for  $204  million  and  Cluster \nProgram II for $200 million, approved in 2003 and 2005, respectively) has the objective of \nsupporting  the  Government  of  Punjab  in  reforming  governance  structures  to  strengthen \nprovincial finances, improve pro-poor service delivery, and create opportunities for growth and \nincome generation. The Balochistan Resource Management Program ($130 million), approved \nin December 2004, aims to improve fiscal and financial discipline, enhance public service \ndelivery,  improve  the  business  environment,  and  ensure  sustainable  water  resource \nmanagement.  \n                                                 \n7  This framework has been developed by a number of stakeholders to assess and develop essential PFM systems. \nThe framework provides a common pool of information for measuring and monitoring PFM performance progress \nand a common platform for dialogue. \n ", "6   \n \n25.  The  PFM  accountability  assessments  and  public  procurement  assessments  are \nexpected  to  act  as  catalysts  for  government  reform  initiatives  and  capacity  development \nprograms at federal, provincial, and local levels in areas of public financial management and \nprocurement. \n \nD.  Transparency and Accountability \n \n26.  Pakistan ranked 144 out of 158 countries surveyed for Transparency International's \ncorruption perception index8 in 2005. People believe few aspects of life are untouched by \ncorruption, and it is widely accepted as a norm and regarded as inevitable. Many people do not \nunderstand the damage corruption does to the national economic, social, and cultural fabric.  \n \n27.  In  a  2006  Transparency  International  survey, 9  respondents  ranked  the  following \ninstitutions as most at risk from corruption: police, power, judiciary, land, taxation, customs, \nhealth,  education,  railway,  and  banks.  Lack  of  accountability,  low  salaries  of  government \nemployees, and discretionary powers were perceived as the main reasons for corruption in \nthese key service delivery departments. Rural lower-income groups have additional concerns \nabout corruption in water, land revenue, irrigation, forestry, zakat,10 and sources of credit. In all \nthese sectors bribes are routinely paid or other influence brought to bear\u2014through coercion or \ncollusion\u2014to be relieved of a traffic fine, get a connection, reduce a tax bill, have a case heard \nby a favored judge, get access to medical care, or be exonerated from an investigation or audit.  \n \n28.  Combating and eradicating corruption has been one of the top priorities of the present \nGovernment, and it featured in the President\u2019s seven-point reform program pursued during the 3 \nyears leading up to the return of elected government in November 2002. The establishment of \nthe  NAB  and  a  host  of  new  laws  and  institutions  at  federal,  provincial,  and  local  levels \nsupporting  governance  reform  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  commitment.  The  drive  against \ncorruption  comprises  a  range  of  legal  measures,  including  laws  relating  to  freedom  of \ninformation, contempt and defamation, national accounts and auditing, local government, and \nthe police. However, the NAB has not been free of criticism. Concerns about its political role, \nselective accountability, and slow speed have been raised in recent years. \n \n29.  The  National  Anti-Corruption  Strategy  (NACS),  introduced  in  2002,  recognizes  that \ncontrolling corruption on a sustainable basis requires a broad vision and a targeted strategy that \nincorporates  prevention,  monitoring,  and  combating,  with  design  and  implementation  by  a \ncoalition of the state, civil society, and the private sector. Studies informing the NACS found that \nPakistan\u2019s national integrity system\u2014its institutions, political processes, and civil society in \nparticular\u2014are extremely weak. The NACS reflects a comprehensive review and assessment of \nthe  causes,  nature,  extent,  and  impact  of  corruption.  It  is  a  broad-based,  high-level  and \nintegrated strategic framework for tackling corruption. The strategy focuses on prevention as \nwell  as  monitoring  and  combating  corruption,  and  it  ensures  consistency  with  the  good \ngovernance reforms. It includes an implementation plan based on the strategic framework.  \n \n30.  ADB provided TA of $440,000 in 2005\u20132006 to strengthen NAB\u2019s institutional capacity to \nperform its growing functions and assume new responsibilities in the context of a medium-term \n                                                 \n8  Transparency International. 2005.

NAB and civil society organizations will continue \nto play critical roles in implementing the strategy to improve public sector transparency and \naccountability. \n \nE.  Performance and Learning Cell \n \n31.  The scope of governance reforms is challenging in terms of its magnitude, diversity, and \nexpected impact. In order to effectively and efficiently capture, analyze, and document lessons \nlearned to inform ongoing program implementation and design of future programs, institutional \nlearning capacity must be a key dimension of the performance review function. A performance \nand learning cell will be established for this purpose. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n32.  The expected impact of the TAC is improved aid effectiveness and efficient use of public \nresources. The outcome of the TAC will be improved performance of devolved service delivery \nand  justice  sector  institutions  for  improved  service  delivery  and  better  access  to  justice, \nespecially for the poor and vulnerable.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n33.  The TAC will have five subclusters: (i) support for justice sector reforms; (ii) support for \ndevolution reforms; (iii) support for strengthening PFM; (iv) capacity building for accountability, \ntransparency, and anticorruption; and (v) performance and learning cell (PLC). Each subcluster \nwill  have  one  or  more  subprojects.  Further  details  of  proposed  subprojects  identified  for \ncommencement shortly after approval of the TAC are in Appendix 3. Additional subprojects will \nbe identified and processed in a sequenced manner. \n \n34.  Subcluster 1 will support the demand side of reforms by engaging with civil society to \nundertake initiatives focused on increasing citizens\u2019 demand for implementing justice sector \nreforms, as well as for improved access to, and quality of, justice sector services. These \ninitiatives  may  include  support  to  civil  society  organizations,  including  nongovernment \norganizations, policy think tanks, researchers, and the media.  \n \n35.  Subcluster 1 will also support second-generation justice sector reforms at provincial \nlevel. Provincial governments are increasingly requesting province-specific justice sector reform \nprograms. Provinces\u2019 identified priority areas include (but are not limited to) social audit of police \ndepartments, support to establishment and capacity development of independent prosecution \nservice, deepening reforms in prison systems, public grievance redress mechanisms, social \nregulation, consumer protection, small claims courts, and bar reforms.  \n \n36.  Support will also be provided to ADB\u2019s ongoing AJP program by providing advisory TA. \nThe subcluster will assist the AJP\u2019s executing and implementing agencies (EA and IAs) to \nconsolidate and sustain the ongoing justice sector reforms, by (i) supporting policy actions \nunder the AJP program loan; and (ii) implementing technical investment projects under the AJP \nTA loan, in the following areas: (a) judicial performance, (b) legal empowerment and education, \n(c) public safety and prosecution, (d) administrative justice, and (e) fiscal reforms.  \n \n ", "8   \n37.  Subcluster 2. ADB\u2019s cluster of devolution programs include the federal-led DSP; the \nprovince-led  DSSPs  in  Balochistan,  Punjab,  and  Sindh;  and  public  resource  management \nprograms in Balochistan and Punjab. AJP also supports new devolved structures supporting \nimproved access to justice, especially for the poor. Subprojects under this subcluster could \nprovide dedicated support to improving the synergies and learning among these devolution \nprojects, with a view to disseminating those lessons learned more broadly within ADB, the \nGovernment, as well as among donors and stakeholders in Pakistan and internationally.  \n \n38.  The subcluster can provide technical advice on designing urban sector development \nprojects with a view to ensure consistency with LGO 2001 and other policies and procedures \nrelated  to  devolution.  More  needs  to  be  learned  about  providing  strategic  support  to \nmetropolitan governments. Mega-city projects are planned for Karachi, Lahore, and possibly \nPeshawar. These city districts have special \u201cdevolved governance\u201d needs demanding focused \nresponses. Federal to provincial devolution reforms are expected in the future, and support \ncould also be provided in this area.  \n \n39.  The 2004 Devolution in Pakistan Study11 identifies seven strategic goals and practical \nsteps that are achievable given progress made to date. Support for advancing these goals and \npractical steps could be provided under subcluster 2. Policy research and dialogue are crucial \nfor learning more about stakeholders\u2019 views and for seeking ways to address diversity across \nprovinces while maintaining the integrity and spirit of devolution principles. Studies assessing \nthe impact of political, administrative, and fiscal decentralization will be supported. \n \n40.  Subcluster 3 will support (i) governance, institutional and corruption risk assessments \nand  diagnostics  in  areas  of  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and  combating \ncorruption;  (ii);  preparation  of  roadmaps  and  planning  for  interventions  in  areas  of  public \nfinancial management, including capital and financial markets; and (iii) design and support to \nfederal, provincial and local government action plans for improvements in defined areas of \nweakness.  \n \n41.  Subcluster  4  will  provide  support  to  capacity  building  of  governance  accountability \ninstitutions.  This  will  include  assistance  to  the  NAB,  provincial  and  local  government \naccountability  institutions,  and  civil  society  organizations.  Two  key  result  areas  will  be  (i) \nimplementing NAB\u2019s organizational restructuring recommendations, and (ii) undertaking priority \nactivities from the NACS implementation plan.  \n \n42.  Subcluster 5 will support establishment of a PLC to undertake regular review of all \nsubproject  initiatives  under  the  TAC.  Lessons  learned  will  be  distilled,  analyzed,  and \ndisseminated through both national and international forums, conferences, and workshops. The \nPLC will be comprised of international and national consultants with expertise in justice sector \ndomains, devolution, PFM, civil society-state relations, anticorruption, capacity development, \nmonitoring and evaluation, research and communications, and analysis of poverty dimensions \nand the nexus with governance structures. The PLC will also contribute to ADB\u2019s efforts toward \nimproving development effectiveness.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB, World Bank, DFID. 2004. Devolution in Pakistan, Islamabad. The study was undertaken at the request of the \nGovernment of Pakistan. Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Studies/Devolution-in-Pakistan/default.asp \n ", "  9\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n43.  The total cost of the TAC is estimated at $14.50 million equivalent, of which $11.50 \nmillion will be financed by the DFID, Government of  the United Kingdom on a grant basis and \n$3 million will be contributed by the Government of Pakistan for office accommodation and \ncounterpart staff support.  ADB will administer the DFID grant.   The cost estimates and \nfinancing  plan  are  in Table  A2.1  of  Appendix  2.  Estimated  funding  requirements  for  each \nsubcluster are in Table A2.2. These subcluster estimates are tentative and subject to budget \nrequirements determined during design and implementation stages. Approval of the TAC does \nnot commit ADB to finance subclusters according to these estimates.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements12 \n \n44.  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  (PRM)  will  be  the  principal  EA  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination of the TAC. PRM will recruit one national project officer and one project analyst, as \nsupernumerary ADB staff, to support this coordination role. The ministries of law and finance, \nthe Punjab planning and development department, and the NAB have indicated strong interest \nto  participate  in  the  TAC,  and  act  as  EAs  for  subprojects  in  areas  consistent  with  their \njurisdictions and mandates. Other relevant government departments and agencies can act as \nEAs for subprojects to be identified in the future.  \n \n45.   A  TAC  Steering  Committee  will  be  established  and  will  be  chaired  by  ADB,  with \nrepresentatives from participating executing agencies, selected implementing agencies, and \nDFID. The Committee will be responsible for (i) approving criteria for selecting subprojects \nconsistent with the TAC design and monitoring framework; (ii) reviewing and approving TAC \nwork plans, including subproject concept papers and indicative budgets, to ensure coherence \nfor effective program delivery and avoid duplication of effort across subclusters and subprojects; \n(iii)  reviewing  progress  and  annual  reports,  including  refining  indicators  and  reporting \nmechanisms;  (iv)  providing  technical  and  management  guidance  on  issues  concerning \nsubcluster and subproject activities; (v) reviewing recommendations submitted by the PLC; and \n(vi) sharing lessons learned from subprojects.  \n \n46.  The  TAC  will  commence  from  March  2007  and  be  implemented  over  36  months. \nSubprojects will be designed and implemented under each subcluster. PRM will start recruiting \nconsultants and activities for the PLC upon signing of the TA letter by the Government. For \nsubprojects under subclusters 1, 2, 3, and 4, a separate fact-finding mission will be undertaken \nfor each subproject and an understanding on the project outcome and outputs, detailed scope of \nwork, cost estimates and budget, and implementation arrangements will be agreed with the \nidentified EA for the subproject. Relevant ministries and departments will be identified as IAs, as \nappropriate.  Each  subproject  EA  will  designate  a  project  director  or  project  manager  and \nappropriate staff to implement the subproject and will ensure that IAs assign appropriate staff. \nWhere  required  for  a  particular  subproject,  implementation  arrangements  may,  subject  to \nfinancial management capacity of the concerned EA and/or IA, provide for advance payment \nfacility to be administered by the subproject\u2019s EA or IA. The procedure for administering the \nadvances  and  subsequently  liquidating  them  will  be  clearly  defined  in  the  implementation \n                                                 \n12 The TAC implementation arrangements incorporate lessons learnt during implementation of TA3079-PRC: TA \nCluster  for  the  Promotion  of  Clean  Technology  and  recorded  in  its  technical  performance  audit  report \n(http://www.adb.org/Documents/TPARs/PRC/tpar_prc_2003-23.pdf). Synergy between interventions under different \nsubclusters will be ensured through the TAC steering committee and regular reviews by the PLC. The TAC will be \nimplemented over 3 years and, at the Government\u2019s request, ADB shall serve as principal EA for overall \ncoordination of TAC activities. \n ", "10  \narrangements in consultation with ADB\u2019s Controller\u2019s Department. Details will be agreed in a \nmemorandum of understanding between ADB and the respective EA for each subproject and \nwill constitute the basis for implementation. The memorandum will be approved by the Country \nDirector,  PRM.  A  TAC  implementation  memorandum  will  be  prepared  to  clearly  identify \nresponsibilities of the subproject and/or subcluster EA and IAs, the TAC Steering Committee, \nPRM,  DFID-Pakistan,  and  internal  ADB  departments  for  administering  the  TAC.  The \nimplementation arrangements outlined in a memorandum of understanding signed with the \nrespective subproject and/or subcluster EA will be consistent with the provisions of the TAC \nimplementation memorandum.  \n \n47.  The consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB and procurement will be carried \nout either by ADB, or by consultants, as appropriate, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Suitable selection methods may \nbe identified during processing of individual subcluster(s) and/or subproject(s) and may, as \nappropriate,  include  firms,  civil  society  organizations,  and/or  individuals.  Based  on  broad \nestimates aggregated from the TAC subclusters, the costing for consulting inputs is estimated at \n200 person-months of international consultants and 1,200 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  Given  the  large  requirements  for  consulting  services,  project  officers  will  be \nencouraged to use the services of consulting firms where possible. Small contracts will be \nawarded, and equipment will be purchased, following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as \namended from time to time). Equipment procured will be handed over to the respective IA(s), as \ndetailed in the subcluster(s) and/or subproject(s) design documents.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n48.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $11,500,000 to the Government of Islamic Republic \nof Pakistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for \nSupport to Governance Reforms in Pakistan. \n ", "Appendix 1 11\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary

Subcluster 1: Support to Justice Sector Reforms  \n \n1.  Subproject 1: Support to Access to Justice Program \n \n    a.  Background \n \n1.  In December 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $350 million loan to the \nGovernment of Pakistan in support of justice sector reform through the Access to Justice Program \n(AJP). The $330 million program loan, including a $25 million endowment fund, was supplemented \nby two funding modalities to support capacity required to effectively achieve the policy actions and \nthereby contribute to the justice sector reforms: (i) a $20 million technical assistance (TA) loan, and \n(ii) advisory technical assistance (TA) funded through two grants.1 This combination of program \nand TA loans and grants for capacity development of the 31 agencies involved in these reforms \nreflects the complex nature of reform processes addressing legislative, regulatory, institutional, and \nhuman resource development aspects. The endowment, Access to Justice Development Fund \n(AJDF), was designed to provide sustainable funding annually for reform activities across seven \nwindows, supplemented in the first few years with dedicated technical advice from both TA loan \nand TA funds. \n \n2.  The AJP is being implemented through a program management unit established in the \nministry of law, justice and human rights and four provincial program management units. At the \nfederal level, the implementing agencies (IAs) are (i) the law and justice commission, (ii) the federal \nombudsman, (iii) the federal judicial academy, (iv) the ministry of interior, and (v) the higher \neducation commission. At the provincial level, the IAs are the departments of law and home, with \nthe planning and development department playing a coordination role. The provincial IAs work \nclosely with (i) the provincial ombudsman, (ii) the high court, (iii) the provincial public safety \ncommission (PSC), and (iv) the police. Following recommendations of the AJP\u2019s 2005 annual \nperformance review (APR), implementation arrangements for the AJP were revised to address \nslow  utilization  of  the  TA  loan.  The  revised  arrangement2 allowed  delegation  of  contract \nmanagement and program monitoring responsibilities to the provincial governments. The ministry \nof law, justice and human rights, at the federal level, continues to provide strategic leadership \nthrough integrated and coherent work planning. The revisions provided more flexibility for program \nmanagement and are expected to impact positively on both the pace of reforms and capacity \nbuilding activities. Following the change in implementation arrangements, the closing date of the \nTA loan (Loan 1899-PAK) was extended from 30 June 2006 to 30 June 2008. \n \n3.  The 2005 APR frequently noted that implementation of the TA loan, AJDF management, \nand technical assistance to a wide range of IAs for achieving compliance with policy actions relied \non  support  from  advisory  TA  engaged  under  grant  resources.  Given  the  technical  nature  of \ndesigning interventions, the 31 IAs of the AJP across Pakistan require constant advisory TA \nsupport  throughout  the  life  of  the  project,  but  resources  are  inadequate  under  the  two  TAs \nmentioned above to support the advisory TA team beyond February 2007.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

The \nconsultant costs had been underestimated and the project objectives and outputs will not be fully \nachieved by June 2007. A request for a reduction of scope will be processed to address this issue.  \n \n17.  The government of Punjab has requested to add two more pilot districts, Lahore and \nChakwal, into the scope activities.  \n \n18.  The government of Punjab has also requested support for two new outputs: (i) a social \naudit of police functioning, and (ii) institutionalization of mandatory referrals of criminal cases to \ncommunity-based conciliation councils in the pilot districts.  \n \n19.  The indicative budget for the new subproject, including completion of unfinished activities \nand outputs of TA 4537, two additional pilot districts, and social audit and work with community-\nbased conciliation councils in pilot districts, is $1 million. The details of the new subproject activities \nwill be agreed through a memorandum of understanding with the government of Punjab. \n                                                 \n4 Musalihat anjumans (conciliation committees), provided for under Chapter XI of the provincial Local Government \nOrdinance(s) 2001, are bodies mandated to achieve out of court amicable settlement of disputes amongst the people \nthrough  mediation,  conciliation  and/or  arbitration  whereas  insaaf  committees,  selected  by  local  councils,  are \nresponsible for the selection of the panel of conciliators of musalihat anjumans.  \n ", " 22  Appendix 3 \nB.  Subcluster 2: Support to Devolution Reforms  \n \n1.  Subproject 1: Review of Implementation of Fiscal Decentralization System \n \n    a.  Background \n  \n20.  Fiscal decentralization is critical for devolution to succeed, and this fact has made it an \nintensely deliberated issue at various forums. The LGO 2001 transfers specified expenditure and \nrevenue assignments to subnational governments.  A  key  focus  area  of  the  Decentralization \nSupport  Program  (DSP)  has  been  to  support  the  institutional  mechanism  to  strengthen  and \naugment the fiscal decentralization process. It has provided support to the provincial finance \ncommissions  (PFCs),  supported  the  development  of  revenue  databases  of  selected  local \ngovernments,  and  been  instrumental  in  streamlining  the  budget-making  processes  of  local \ngovernments. PFCs in three of the four provinces have announced their awards, thereby bringing \nrelative  predictability  and  transparency  to  the  fiscal  transfer  mechanism.  However,  local \ngovernments in general have been raising the issue of fiscal autonomy at various forums. It has \nbeen 5 years since fiscal decentralization was introduced in Pakistan, and it is an apt time to \nascertain whether the design and implementation of a fiscal decentralization system has achieved \nits objectives and to determine the issues responsible for low fiscal autonomy at local levels.  \n \n    b.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n21.  Major outcomes of the study will be analysis and supporting recommendations on the \nfollowing aspects of fiscal decentralization:  \n(i)  a  predictable  and  transparent  fiscal  transfer  mechanism  (outputs:  regular  PFC \nawards;  fiscal  need,  fiscal  capacity,  fiscal  effort,  and  fiscal  performance  clearly \nmanifested in the PFC awards); \n(ii)  adequate own-source revenues for the local governments (outputs: financial and \nfiscal autonomy in policies and development of the local governments); and \n(iii)  reducing the number of vertical programs (outputs: effective functioning of local \nplanning institutions). \n \n    c.  Methodology   \n \n22.  A  comprehensive  field  study  will  be  undertaken  under  the  subproject  to  review  the \nimplementation of fiscal decentralization during the last 5 years. The study will be undertaken in \nselect local governments. The sample will include all three tiers of local governments (district, tehsil, \nand union) in all four provinces.  \n \n23.  The study will require highly technical expertise to analyze the fiscal devolution system by \nconducting research as well as carrying out and supervising surveys. A team of international and \nnational consultants will be recruited. At the end of the study, an international conference will \ncompare Pakistan\u2019s experience with other countries that have undergone similar experimentation.  \n \n    d.  Indicative Budget \n \n24.  The  subproject  will  be  implemented  over  12  months  (June  2007-May  2008)  and  the \nindicative budget is $ 0.4 million. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  23\nC.  Subcluster 3: Support to Public Financial Management \n \n1.  Subproject  1:    Support  to  Public  Financial  Management  Assessment  and \nProcurement Assessment  \n    a.  Background \n \n25.  Public sector financial management reforms are a key component of governance reforms. \nTo  support  the  Government  in  these  areas,  ADB  has  been  supporting  public  resource \nmanagement  programs  in  two  provinces\u2014Punjab  and  Balochistan.  In  Punjab,  the  Punjab \nResource Management Program aims to support the government of Punjab in undertaking reforms \nin governance structures for strengthening provincial finances, improving pro-poor service delivery, \nand creating opportunities for growth and income generation. It has two clusters: Cluster Program I \nfor $204 million (approved in December 2003) and Cluster Program II for $200 million (approved in \nDecember  2005).  The  Balochistan  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $130  million,  was \napproved in December 2004 and aims at improving fiscal and financial discipline, enhancing public \nservice delivery, improving the business environment, and ensuring sustainable water resource \nmanagement in the province.  \n \n26.  ADB  intends  to  complement  these  initiatives  with  support  for  public  sector  financial \nmanagement  by  (i)  assisting  federal  and  provincial  governments  in  preparing  public  financial \nmanagement accountability assessments and public procurement assessments, and (ii) helping to \ndesign  and  implement  government-owned  federal  and  provincial  action  plans  aimed  at \nimprovements in the defined areas of weakness.  \n \n    b.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n27.  The subproject outcome is a strengthened financial management system encompassing \nreliable  budget  management  processes,  strong  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  and  audit \ncontrols as per international standards.  \n \n28.  Outputs will include the likes of (i) a common pool of information for Government-donor \ndialogue to be made available for measurement and monitoring of public financial management \nperformance progress, and (ii) actions plans developed and adopted by the Government. \n \n    c.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n29.  Key activities include: (i) federal and provincial public financial management accountability \nassessments  and  public  procurement  assessments,  (ii)  design  of  federal  and  provincial \ngovernment  action  plans  aimed  at  improvements  in  the  defined  areas  of  weakness,  and  (iii) \nsupport to implementing action plans. \n \n    d.  Indicative Budget \n \n30.  The indicative budget for the subproject is $ 0.2 million.  \n ", " 24  Appendix 3 \nD.  Subcluster 4: Capacity Building for Accountability, Transparency and Anticorruption  \n \n  1.  Subproject 1:  Capacity Building of NAB and Implementation of NACS \n \n    a.  Background \n \n31.  Combating and eradicating corruption has been one of the top priorities of the present \nGovernment and featured in the President\u2019s seven-point reform program pursued during the 3 \nyears leading up to the return of elected government in November 2002. To put this policy into \neffect, the Government established the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) under the NAB \nOrdinance 1999 and provided legal durability for the NAB through amendments to the Constitution. \nNAB requested ADB technical assistance to strengthen its institutional capacity for managing its \ngrowing portfolio of functions and assuming new responsibilities in the context of a medium-term \nframework  of  activities  contained in  the  National  Anti-Corruption  Strategy  (NACS)  announced \nduring mid-2002. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s goal in its TA5 to strengthen the NAB was to improve the Bureau\u2019s capacity to \nperform broader functions in preventing corruption while becoming more effective, scientific, and \nintegrated at all levels of government in performing its functions. The TA aimed to enable NAB to \nbetter prioritize its functions, strengthen its investigative capability, and enhance its performance in \nidentifying, preparing, and prosecuting corruption cases. NAB\u2019s dependence on other government \nagencies for performing such functions had to be reduced in order to enhance its capacity for \ncombating and preventing corruption. The TA assisted NAB in developing better coordination with \nagencies and activities to prevent corruption at the provincial and local government levels by \ndeveloping its capacity to provide advice and training.  \n \n33.  NAB has requested further assistance from ADB to (i) prepare operational manuals, and (ii) \nsupport implementation of the NACS.  \n \n    b.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n34.  The outcome is strengthening overall capacity and capability of NAB. Outputs are (i) high-\nquality manuals in selected priority functions prepared and disseminated, and (ii) implementation of \nselected aspects of NACS.  \n \n    c.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n35.  International consultants will be hired to prepare the selected manuals. NACS is being \nimplemented  by  a  high-powered  implementation  committee,  chaired  by  NAB\u2019s  chairman.  Its \nmembers include federal secretaries of establishment, finance, law, interior, and information; the \nchairman  of  the  central  board  of  revenue  and  all  provincial  chief  secretaries;  along  with \nrepresentatives of the auditor general, federal ombudsman, securities and exchange commission, \ncivil society, media, academia, nongovernment organizations, and the business community. Priority \nactivities of the NACS that could be supported under the TAC include: \n(i)  Executive\u2014public sector management. Training courses on \"ethics management \nsystems\" in leading civil service training institutions. \n(ii)  Executive\u2014public  interface  functions.

The above does not constitute an exhaustive list of interventions. It may be amended and \nprioritized further after consultation with stakeholders, including NAB.  \n \n    e.  Indicative Budget  \n \n37.  The indicative budget is $1 million over 3 years commencing from March 2007. \n \nE.  Subcluster 5: Performance and Learning Cell \n1.  Background \n \n38.  Accountability,  quality  assurance,  and  learning  from  experience  are  the  key  principles \nembodied in ADB\u2019s programs supporting governance reforms. These principles focus on four areas: \n(i) legal and policy basis of reforms, (ii) budget management and accountability, (iii) institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building efforts, and (iv) performance of endowment and grant fund \nresource pools. Effective monitoring and evaluation is also essential to the annual performance \nreview approach adopted by DSP and AJP that provides for systematic input by district-level \nauthorities  and  civil  society,  extending  to  province  and  then  federal  level.  This  \u201cbottom-up\u201d \nmonitoring process is unfamiliar, and, in many respects, contrary to the culture of executive and \njudicial practices in Pakistan.  \n \n39.  In addition to the imperative to monitor, evaluate, and provide coherent program and policy \nadvice to DSP and AJP IAs, analytical reports must be available to enable program managers and \npolicymakers  to  learn  lessons  from  experience.  Additional  support  is  essential  for  effective \nmonitoring and evaluation of governance programs and policy outcomes.  \n \n40.  The scope of governance reforms is challenging in terms of its magnitude, diversity, and \nexpected impact. In order to effectively and efficiently capture, analyze, and document lessons \nlearned to inform ongoing program implementation and design of future programs, institutional \nlearning  capacity  must  be  a  key  dimension  of  the  performance  review  function.  Given  the \ncomplexity of the issues being addressed under the technical assistance cluster (TAC) for support \nto governance reforms, it is imperative to involve consultants who have the capacity to contribute \nto the learning process with some continuity over time.  \n \n41.  The Performance and Learning Cell (PLC) will comprise a core team of international and \nnational consultants with expertise in the broad range of TA initiatives undertaken through all \nsubprojects under the TAC. The PLC will undertake periodic (biannual) reviews of TAC activities. It \ncan also provide more specific technical inputs in areas where international experience is sought. \nOptions for locating the PLC, or selected functions of the PLC, within an appropriate national \n ", " 26  Appendix 3 \ndevelopment organization will be further explored. It is anticipated that some functions of the PLC \nwill be managed by the Pakistan Resident Mission directly (i.e., through the APR). \n \n  2.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n42.  The outcome is enhanced quality of review and evaluation of TAC subprojects and the TAC \nas a whole. The outputs are annual performance reports and periodic technical reports, as required, \nover 3 years.  \n \n  3.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n43.  The PLC will be comprised of a governance specialist and sector experts on justice sector \ndomains (judiciary, police and public safety, administrative justice, bar reforms, alternative dispute \nresolution),  devolution  (political,  administrative,  and  fiscal),  public  financial  management,  civil \nsociety-state relations, anticorruption, capacity development, monitoring and evaluation, research \nand communications, as well as analysis of poverty dimensions and the nexus with governance \nstructures. The governance specialist will have expertise in a broad range of governance issues, \nwith specific expertise in at least two of the four technical subproject disciplines (justice; devolution; \npublic financial management; and transparency, accountability, and anticorruption).  \n \n44.  The team will undertake APRs over the 3 year duration of the TAC, as well as periodic \ntechnical reviews, as required. The APRs will encompass all TAC initiatives and will assess the \ncontribution of the subprojects and TAC initiatives to the expected impact of the TAC as a whole.  \n \n45.   In addition to the aforementioned functions, the PLC will be in particular responsible for \n(i)  providing secretarial services for the TAC Steering Committee. \n(ii)  supporting APRs of the TAC. The APRs shall evaluate performance of all TAC \ninitiatives, including subprojects reports of which shall be shared with all IAs and \nstakeholders. \n(iii)  providing specific technical inputs in areas where international experience is sought. \n(iv)  carrying out impact studies to assess contributions from ADB\u2019s support to improving \ndevelopment effectiveness. For this, coordination meetings will need to be held, \nstudies conducted, and effectiveness and impact reports prepared. \n(v)  compiling and reviewing lessons, followed by dissemination through appropriate \nforums, conferences and workshops, both national and international. \n(vi)  providing  timely  and  effective  secretarial  support  to  TAC  operations,  including \ndesign of subclusters and/or subprojects. \n(vii)  holding policy dialogues on governance reforms, publishing research papers and/or \npolicy briefs, and ensuring wide dissemination through conferences and workshops. \nResulting feedback and inputs should then be incorporated into TAC interventions. \n \n  4.
