THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Stepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration Program, and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the Stepping \nUp Investments for Growth Acceleration Program.1  \n \n2.  The program will support the Government of Indonesia\u2019s key reform priorities aimed at \naccelerating domestic and foreign direct investment to enable the country to reach its average \nmedium-term economic growth target of 7%\u20139% per annum for the next 10 years. The reform \npriorities include a more predictable and open business environment, diversified modalities of \ninfrastructure financing, and faster and more transparent public procurement. The program \nreflects  the  government\u2019s  bottom-up  and  lessons-learned  approach  in  reform  design  and \nimplementation to ensure policy coherence among agencies and different tiers of government. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Indonesia has a large investment requirement. Given the country\u2019s robust annual growth \nof  6.2%  during  2010\u20132013  and  the  increasing  magnitude  of  the  middle  class,  total  direct \ninvestments grew from $23 billion, or 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), in 2010 to $41 \nbillion, or 4.7% of GDP, in 2013, with 75% of these investments from foreign sources.2 Surveys \nof the private sector entities also confirm the robust attitude toward investment in Indonesia. \nInternationally, for the first time since 1992, Indonesia is considered one of the most promising \ncountries to do business.3 The potential for future growth in local markets, low labor cost, a \nsteady supply of assemblers, and concentration of industry contribute to the private sector\u2019s \npositive view of investing in Indonesia. However, challenges remain in unleashing Indonesia\u2019s \ninvestment potential. \n \n4.  Increasing  investment  is  needed  for  Indonesia  to  achieve  its  long-term  growth \nobjectives, including becoming one of the world\u2019s 10 largest economies by 2025, as outlined in \nthe economic master plan.4 Attaining these objectives requires the gross investment ratio to rise \nabove Indonesia\u2019s average gross investment to GDP ratio of 26% achieved during 2002\u20132012. \nTo support achieving this higher investment ratio, the government, in 2012, introduced a long-\nterm general plan for direct investments that aims at accelerating domestic and foreign capital \ninvestments  and  promotes  more  sustainable  investments  that  are  inclusive. 5  Increased \nsustainable investments will be achieved through improving the investment climate, promoting \nmore investments in lagging regions, promoting investments that have positive externalities on \nthe environment, developing infrastructure, and providing fiscal incentives. For the plan to be \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Direct investments refer to investments in machine, equipment, and transportation. The data source for direct \ninvestments  is  Indonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  or  BKPM  Compared  with  other  members  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, Indonesia has much room for improvement in foreign direct investment. \nDuring 2009\u20132012, net foreign direct investment inflows averaged 1.8% of GDP while during the same period, in \nThailand it was 2.6% of GDP, 3.2% in Malaysia, and 6.2% in Viet Nam. \n3  Japan Bank for International Cooperation. 2013.

", "2 \nsuccessful, the government needs to increase  public and private participation, ensure that \nprivate investments generate employment and prepare Indonesia to enter the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations Economic Community in 2015. \n \n5.  Indonesia\u2019s  business  environment  is  still  plagued  by  weak  institutions.  One  of  the \nbiggest  constraints  of  doing  business  in  Indonesia  is  inefficient  government  bureaucracy.6 \nExcessive bureaucracy and a lack of coordination have undermined the country\u2019s business \nenvironment. As such, the 2014 World Bank\u2019s Doing Business ranks Indonesia at 120 out of \n189 economies (behind Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Philippines).7 The biggest factor that \ncauses the low rank is the length period to start a new business \u2013 48 days.  \n \n6.  The  government\u2019s  lead  role  in  infrastructure  development  needs  to  be  reflected  in \ncommensurately significant infrastructure investments. In this context, the central government \nincreased  public  infrastructure  investment  from  Rp26.0  trillion  (0.9%  of  GDP)  in  2005  to \nRp188.4 trillion (2.0% of GDP) in 2013, despite its limited fiscal space. However, this investment \nis relatively low when compared with Malaysia (9.0% of GDP) and Thailand (7.0% of GDP). \nPublic investments in infrastructure are also hampered by complex land acquisition processes. \nAlthough the land acquisition law was introduced in 2012, proper implementation of the law \nrequires better coordination and collaboration among central government agencies utilizing the \nland, provincial governments, and the National Land Agency (BPN). \n \n7.  Local governments increased their contribution to infrastructure investments from close \nto 0.4% of GDP in 2000 to 1.3% of GDP in 2013, reflecting the impact of fiscal decentralization, \nwhich transferred spending assignments and financing to local governments. In effect, 65% of \ninfrastructure  investments  are  now  provided  by  local  governments,  up  from  20%  prior  to \ndecentralization. Most of the spending on infrastructure, however, is financed by transfers from \nthe  central  government.  To  promote  more  local  infrastructure  investments,  the  central \ngovernment has allowed local governments to tap into other funding sources such as capital \nmarkets. However, progress has been slow due to local governments\u2019 creditworthiness, lack of \ncentral  government\u2019s  cofinancing  mechanisms,  and  unclear  responsibility  for  infrastructure \ninvestment by local governments. \n \n8.  Private investment in infrastructure has remained low. During 2008\u20132011, the average \nannual private sector investment in infrastructure remained at 0.4% of GDP, compared to the \n2.3% that occurred during 1995\u20131997. The central government has encouraged the private \nsector to invest in infrastructure through participation in public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). \nHowever, out of 31 PPPs financially closed during 2005\u20132012, only one project used the 2005 \nPPP  framework,  while  all  other  projects  used  other  relevant  sector  frameworks,8 primarily \nbecause the legal framework for PPPs has remained fragmented. The PPP program has also \nbeen affected by ineffective government decision-making mechanisms, the lack of a central \nPPP office to drive the overall PPP program within the government, and limited support to \ngovernment  contracting  agencies  (GCAs)  throughout  the  project  cycle  (including  through \nengaging reputable transaction advisors to prepare projects for tender and investment).9 \n \n9.  The complex public procurement process also negatively impacts public investments. \nLack of capacity and the weak institutional set-up in public procurement within both the central \n                                                \n6  World Economic Forum. 2013.

Lessons from past Asian Development Bank support. The design of the program \ntakes  lessons  from  past  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  in  infrastructure,  fiscal \ndecentralization,  investment  climate,  public  procurement,  and  connectivity.10 The  extensive \ndialogue between the Government and ADB helped in ensuring a strong ownership. Some \naccomplishments are adoption of a land acquisition law in 2012, establishment of regulatory \nframework for municipal bonds, adoption of the PPP framework in 2005 and the subsequent \nestablishment of facilitating financing facilities, and the adoption of a legal framework for public \nprocurement. However, the performance of past ADB-supported reforms has been affected by \n(i) challenges in coordination among major central government agencies, (ii) delays in decision \nmaking due to concerns to avoid corruption allegations, (iii) challenges with harmonizing the \nfragmented legal frameworks, (iv) cumbersome land acquisition systems, (v) weak capacity of \nlocal governments, and (vi) policy incoherence between the central and local governments. \n \n11.  Value addition of the program. Continuity of past programs supported by ADB is an \nimportant  element  in  the  program  design.  One  good  example  is  the  work  on  PPP.  The \nprogram\u2019s focus on institutional improvement for PPP is a continuing reform agenda under \nADB\u2019s infrastructure reform program (please see footnote 9). The program also aims to ensure \nstrong  ownership  also  happens  at  local  levels  by  pilot-testing  reforms  in  selected  local \ngovernment before adopting them nationally and to include local governments in any public\u2013\nprivate dialogue that address subsector- and region-specific problems. \n \n12.  The programmatic approach adopted for the program will allow the new administration\u2014\nbuilding on thrusts, achievements, and lessons from past reform efforts\u2014to chart the next \nphase  of  policy  reforms.  The  program  will  comprise  two  subprograms:  subprogram  1  is \nexpected to be submitted to the ADB Board of Directors for consideration on or before 30 \nSeptember 2014, with subprogram 2 expected to be submitted in September 2016. Subprogram \n1 targets on the regulatory and strategic frameworks reforms to accelerate public and private \ninvestments while subprogram 2 focuses on institutional capacity development for accelerating \ninvestments. The program also reflects discussions with multilateral and bilateral development \npartners, and leverages their ongoing and programmed support to the reform areas covered by \nthe program.11 \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2005.

Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The program\u2019s impact will be increased investment as a share of GDP. The outcome will \nbe private and public sector investments increased. This outcome will be achieved through \nsupporting reforms presented in section C. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The program aims to (i) create a more predictable and open business environment by \nattracting more foreign and domestic investments and reducing the cost of doing business,  \n(ii) diversify modalities for infrastructure financing by piloting new public sector modalities for \ninfrastructure  financing,  and  creating  a  conducive  environment  for  private  financing  of \ninfrastructure projects, and (iii) develop faster and more transparent public procurement to \nincrease budget utilization. \n \n15.  The policy matrix (Appendix 4) covers seven key reform areas, with subprogram 1 \nconsisting of 21 policy measures and subprogram 2 consisting of 22 policy measures. All policy \nactions under subprogram 1 have been completed. \n \n1.  Output 1: More Predictable and Open Business Environment \n \n16.  Attract  more  foreign  direct  investment  and  increase  domestic  investment. To \nattract more foreign direct investment and increase domestic investments, the government has \nenacted  four  policy  reforms  to  further  ease  restrictions  for  foreign  investment,  simplify \nprocedures  for  foreign  investment,  expand  tax  allowance  for  investment,  and  increase \npredictability of fixed cost for investment. \n \n17.  To help ease foreign investment restrictions, the government has issued a new negative \ninvestment list that reduces the amount of closed and restricted industries from 276 to 220. The \nnew list also brings consistency with the prevailing sector laws, harmonizes and simplifies \nforeign capital ownership, and promotes foreign investments in PPP. The key improvement of \nthe new list is that it enables foreigners to own up to 49% (from 0%) of land transportation \nmanagement and operation facilities, and up to 95% (from 49%) of seaports\u2019 management \nundertaken as a PPP. \n \n18.  The Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board has also simplified procedures to get \nbusiness  licenses  for  foreign  investors.  The  new  regulation  has  improved  consistency  in \nmethods, procedures, and timelines of assessment of applications and issuance of investment \nlicenses, and has introduced uniformity for the issuance of licenses at the central, provincial, \nregional, and municipal investment licensing offices. \n \n19.  To improve the quality of investments and to incentivize the private sector to invest in \nless-developed regions, the government plans to provide more income tax incentives to the \nmanufacturing industry. The new regulation aims to expand the coverage of businesses eligible \nfor income tax benefits to promote investment outside of Java and increase the economic well-\nbeing of the population in less-developed regions. Currently, close to 60% of private sector \ninvestments are in Java. The draft government regulation was approved at the interministerial \nlevel and submitted to the President for signing and issuance. \n \n20.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  new \ninvestment  lists  and  review  the  existing  regulatory  framework  for  direct  investments.  The \ngovernment will also improve the public\u2013private dialogue mechanism and introduce guidelines \n ", "5 \nfor income tax incentives to contribute to investment promotion. \n \n21.  Reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business.  The  government  has  accelerated  efforts  to \nimprove aspects of the business environment to help stabilize the economy. To improve the \nease  of  doing  business,  the  government  announced  17  major  actions  in  October  2013.12 \nSubprogram 1 focuses on reforms related to the reduction of red tape and ease of access to \nfinance. The red tape-related reforms are (i) issuing a business trading license and company \nregistration certificate simultaneously through a one-stop service that reduces processing time \nto 3 days, (ii) streamlining the establishment of an online business entity by reducing the \nnumber of related procedures from four to one and improving the processing time from 16 days \nto  1  day,  (iii)  expediting  settlement  of  commercial  disputes  in  contract  enforcement,  \n(iv) expediting transfer of land rights to a maximum of 5 days post submission, and (v) initiating \nonline facilities for taxpayer registration and pilot testing of electronic invoicing for business-to-\nbusiness value-added tax transactions. To improve access to finance for small and medium-\nsized enterprises, the government, through Bank Indonesia, permitted the establishment of \nprivate credit information bureaus. \n \n22.  Under subprogram 2, the government will continue to implement, monitor, and evaluate \nthe ease of doing business reform. To ensure investment policy coherence between central and \nlocal governments, the central government will assist one provincial government in establishing \na one-stop service for investment licenses. \n \n2.  Output 2: Diversification of Modalities for Infrastructure Financing \n \n23.  Pilot new public sector modalities for infrastructure financing. The government has \ncontinued  focusing  on  addressing  its  infrastructure  deficit  by  facilitating  access  by  local \ngovernments to capital markets for infrastructure projects, motivating local governments to use \navailable budget resources on more infrastructure spending, and introducing new instruments to \nfinance infrastructure projects. \n \n24.  The government has issued a regulatory framework to support the local governments to \nissue subnational bonds. The regulations put in place strict fiscal conditions, such as total debt \nof no more than 75% of the previous year\u2019s local revenue and a debt service coverage ratio not \nexceeding 2.5. Further, the MOF requires local governments to set up a debt management unit \nbefore issuing a bond. To help diversify modalities and support the local implementation of \nthese  measures,  the  MOF,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB,  is  building  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments  to  strengthen  their  debt  management  and  to  conduct  due  diligence  for  the \nissuance  of  subnational  bonds  for  large  infrastructure  projects.  A  pilot  study  is  currently \nunderway in one large province, which includes assistance for due diligence covering shadow \nrating  and  issuance,  a  review  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  underlying  project,  and  an \nassessment of the debt management capacity of the provincial government. \n \n25.  The  government  has  also  introduced  project-based  sukuk  (Islamic  bonds)  as  new \ninstruments  to  finance  national  infrastructure  projects  through  the  capital  market.  Total \noutstanding  project-based  sukuk  issuance  as  of  17  April  2014  was  close  to  Rp29  trillion. \nProject-based sukuk have been used to finance two national infrastructure projects that will \nimprove connectivity. The issuance of the sukuk also helps implementation because it requires \nthe Debt Management Office of the MOF to monitor project development. \n                                                \n12 There are eight key target areas: starting a business, getting electricity, paying taxes and insurance premiums, \nenforcing legal contracts, resolving insolvency, registering property, obtaining construction permits, and getting \ncredit. As of April 2014, 15 out of the 17 actions had been implemented by the government. \n ", "6 \n26.  The government is also considering introducing a new financing intermediary to fund \nbasic local infrastructure projects. The MOF currently provides a venue for local governments to \nfinance  their  local  infrastructure  projects  by  accessing  a  fund  that  is  managed  by  the \ngovernment investment agency. However, convoluted processes to borrow funds\u2014borrowing \nrequires local parliament approval and much higher funding costs (Bank Indonesia prime rate \nplus 250 basis points)\u2014allows only 12 out of 458 local governments to access the facility, with \ndisbursements close to $156 million. To improve local government infrastructure financing for \nbasic  infrastructure,  the  MOF\u2019s  institution  transformational  blueprint  establishes  a  regional \ninfrastructure development fund (RIDF) to cofinance local government infrastructure projects in \nline with public accounting standards and the public budget system. \n \n27.  Under subprogram 2, the government will continue strengthening the capacity of local \ngovernments in debt and risk management by upgrading the local finance courses offered by \nthe MOF. The MOF will also provide adequate resources to the RIDF, adopt and disclose its \ninstitutional  and  operating  procedures,  and  conduct  an  awareness  campaign  on  the  RIDF \namong local governments. The MOF will also review the framework for the issuance of region-\nbased project sukuk, and conduct  an awareness campaign on region-based project  sukuk \nfinancing among local governments. \n \n28.  Create a conducive environment for private financing of infrastructure projects. In \n2013\u20132014, the government continued to improve the enabling environment for PPPs through \n(i) amending the 2005 PPP framework to allow for several extensions to financial close of PPP \nprojects (maximum of 1 year each); (ii) adopting harmonized principles and procedures on the \nuse of state assets in PPP projects as part of a new government regulation on state or regional \nasset management; and (iii) initiating consultations on the draft law on land to address the \nunderground  and  overground  terms  of  land  use  and  ownership.  As  the  next  step  in  the \nimplementation of the new land acquisition framework, BPN established a dedicated office to \nlead the formulation of policies on land acquisition, determination of ownership of land rights, \nand land valuation under infrastructure projects. \n \n29.  The  government  also  established  a  framework  for  accelerated  delivery  of  priority \ninfrastructure projects by (i) assigning an interagency committee with decision-making authority \nover the preparation and implementation of priority infrastructure projects; (ii) assigning clear \nresponsibilities to the National Development Planning Agency, the Coordinating Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs, and the MOF in supporting GCAs with priority project delivery; and (iii) giving \nthe MOF the mandate to set up a project development fund to cover the cost of preparing \nfeasibility studies for and transaction support to PPP projects. The development of the new \nframework was informed by lessons learned from the experience of the National Committee on \nAcceleration of Infrastructure Development.13  \n \n30.  Measures were also taken to ensure PPP projects arising both from the 2005 PPP \nframework  and  sector  frameworks  are  rolled  out.  These  included  (i)  gaining  approval  by \nexpansion  of  the  scope  of  business  viability  guarantees  in  support  of  the  performance  of \nPerusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (Indonesia\u2019s  state-owned  electricity  company)  under  power \npurchase agreements with independent power producers, (ii) regulating ownership of assets \nunder a joint operating contract of a geothermal PPP project, (iii) increasing the threshold for \ndirect purchase of land from 1 to 5 hectares, and (iv) addressing the sources of funding for land \nacquisition in the national and local budgets. One critical action that will promote PPP is the \n                                                \n13 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Infrastructure (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \noperationalization of viability gap funding; two GCAs have submitted applications to the MOF for \nprovision of viability gap funding for their PPP projects. \n \n31.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  improving  the  PPP  framework \nthrough the introduction of availability-type PPPs, allowing PPPs in social sectors, the explicit \nrecognition  of  state-owned  enterprises  as  GCAs  and  qualifying  state-owned  enterprises\u2019 \nparticipation in PPPs as a business entity to mitigate conflict of interest, and enabling PPP \nprojects with existing state assets to avail themselves of government support schemes. The \ngovernment will also complete the establishment and operationalization of the PPP unit at the \nMOF\u2014as a first step towards a separate central PPP office\u2014to lead the country\u2019s PPP program \nand be the core facilitator in the preparation of bankable PPP infrastructure projects. As a \nstrategic issue and reflecting on lessons learned in subprogram 1, the government will initiate \nthe preparation of an integrated framework for private provision of public infrastructure and \nservices. The government plans to develop an academic paper on PPP law and a high-level \ninfrastructure-focused government mechanism to address cooperation and accountability issues \namong central and local governments. \n \n32.  The government  will  also  continue  ensuring  smooth processing  and  rollout  of  PPP \nprojects through budget allocation and approval of viability gap funding, and it will continue \ncarrying  out  action-oriented  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  geothermal  fund  and \nbusiness  viability  guarantees  for  energy-generation  projects.  As  part  of  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  BPN\u2019s  office  on  land  acquisition,  operational  manuals  on  the  land  acquisition \nprocess will be developed for GCAs. To draw initial lessons from the new land acquisition \nframework, BPN will conduct an action-oriented assessment of the implementation of the new \nland acquisition law. \n \n3.  Output 3: Faster and More Transparent Public Procurement \n \n33.  The government, through the National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA), has taken \nsteps  to  increase  budget  utilization  through  automating  the  public  procurement  process \n(particularly for procuring goods and services in the eastern part of Indonesia, where access to \nvendors  is  limited),  and  enforcing  usage  of  e-catalogs  for  e-purchasing  to  expedite  the \nprocurement process and budget absorption. With ADB\u2019s TA, the NPPA is assisting one large \nlocal government to establish its own e-catalogs.14 \n \n34.  In enhancing procurement capacity, the NPPA is working with 29 procurement service \nunits (PSUs) at the national and local government levels to be the subjects of a pilot study in an \neffort to professionalize PSUs. This pilot program will be replicated with other PSUs nationwide. \nThe NPPA has also initiated reforms in the procurement process for large, complex construction \ncontracts through the finalization of a draft international competitive bidding document that is \navailable  for  discussion  with  stakeholders.  In coordination  with  the  MOF  and the  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency,  the  NPPA  has  also  begun  preparing  standard  bidding \ndocuments for PPPs in the education and health sectors for pilot testing purposes. \n \n35.  Under subprogram 2, the government will adopt a new public procurement framework \nthat  will  strengthen  the  function  of  PSUs,  institutionalize  e-procurement,  and  ensure  full \nsynchronization with the investment selection process under the PPP framework. The reforms \nwill also cover the introduction of a benchmarking system for (i) assessing the capacity of \nprocuring  entities  in  public  procurement,  and  (ii)  ensuring  adequate  budget  funding  for \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2008.

The  loan  size  of  subprogram  1  takes  in  account  Indonesia\u2019s  increased  overall \ndevelopment  financing  needs  and  specific  elements  of  the  government\u2019s  development \nexpenditure programs. The economic slowdown in 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 caused the \ngovernment to reduce the 2014 GDP growth target from 5.8%\u20136.0% to 5.5%, resulting in the \nreduction of the estimated budget revenue from $145 billion to $139 billion, with the expenditure \nactually having increased by $600 million in the revised 2014 budget. This caused the 2014 \nfiscal deficit to increase from the budgeted 1.7% to 2.5 % of GDP, to be financed through the \nlarger government borrowing plan, which has increased from the originally planned $16 billion to \n$23 billion in the revised 2014 budget. In light of this, the government has increased the \ndevelopment policy share of its ODA borrowing from $339 million to $1.5 billion. The estimated \nadministrative and implementation cost of reforms under subprogram 1 is $493 million;15 the \nloss of budget revenues due to tax allowance reforms is estimated at $333 million.  \n \n37.  Given the increased fiscal space constraints and budgeted development expenditure \nprograms, the government has requested a loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan \nmaturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.  The financing for \nsubprogram 2 is currently planned to be $200 million. The loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe full exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmembers, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to Indonesia in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  simplifying  disbursement  requirements  for  program  loans. 16 \nSubprogram  1  will  receive  parallel  cofinancing  of  $200  million  from  German  development \ncooperation through KfW.17  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n38.  The Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs will be the executing agency. The MOF, \nIndonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM),  BPN,  and  the  NPPA  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The implementation of program policy actions will be monitored through \n(i) a steering committee that will be chaired by a deputy minister of the executing agency and \nconsist of director-level officials of implementing agencies and relevant local governments that \nare affected by the program, and (ii) regular meetings of technical working groups set up for \neach output or sub-output, as the case may be, to discuss interim progress in the reform \nagenda. These working groups will consist of echelon two of the implementing agencies and will \noperationalize the program\u2019s approach on establishing an effective dialogue between national \nand local governments and the business community. The implementation period is January \n2013\u2013September 2014 for subprogram 1, and October 2014\u2013September 2016 for subprogram 2, \nreflecting  the government\u2019s  phasing  of  investment reforms. The  policy-based  loans  will  be \ndisbursed upon accomplishment of agreed policy actions. \n                                                \n15 Brief Assessment of Reform Program Cost (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 ADB. 2012.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic \n \n39.  The policy actions of the program are derived from the government\u2019s medium-term \nreform priorities, which are crucial in achieving the government\u2019s strategy of higher and more \ninclusive growth. Currently, with exports still slow to recover, investment will need to play a \nlarger role in supporting growth. The proposed reforms are expected to stimulate more foreign \ndirect investment, encourage more businesses to open, and increase infrastructure investment, \nwhich could generate additional economic growth of up to 1 percentage point annually over the \nmedium term. 18 The proposed reforms will also help improve the quality of employment by \nincreasing employment opportunities in the formal sector, and reduce poverty in lagging regions, \ne.g., Eastern Indonesia, where poverty incidence is much higher. Improved connectivity will also \nlead to improvement in access to and delivery of services in Eastern Indonesia. Combined, \nthese will help reduce inequality over the medium term. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n40.  The government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for public financial management. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state \ntreasury, and state audit in 2003\u20132004, most of the regulations underpinning these laws have \nbeen promulgated. In 2012, the number of government agencies that received unqualified audit \nopinion from the external audit agency increased to 65%, from about 40% in 2009. ADB has \nreinforced this momentum with continuing support to improve technical capacity and controls. \nBuilding  on  previous  programs,  ADB\u2019s  TA  to  strengthen  public  procurement  has  been \ncommitted to boosting transparency and efficiency in public procurement processes. As a result \nof the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reduce corruption, the capacity of the Corruption \nEradication  Commission  has  improved  markedly.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n41.  The  reforms  supported  under  the  program  are  likely  to  reduce  poverty  through \nimprovements  in  the  investment  climate  and  improved  infrastructure.  A  more  conducive \ninvestment climate will lead to more and better investment that would generate more productive \njobs, which are keys to inclusive growth. Better infrastructure will contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough higher growth caused by increased infrastructure investments. For example, if the \ninfrastructure stock had grown during 2001\u20132011 by 10% per year instead of the actual 3%, \nGDP could have grown by 7.0% per year rather than the actual 5.3%. This in turn could have \nreduced the national poverty rate to 6.9% in 2011 instead of the actual 11.4%.19 Another poverty \nimpact relates to facilitation of PPPs in the health and education sectors likely to positively affect \nnon-income poverty through improved access and use of education and health facilities. The \ncross-cutting nature of the program\u2019s reforms suggests it is not amenable to gender designs. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n42.  The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified under category \nC for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n                                                \n18 ADB.  2011.

The program design will mitigate all risks by providing a strong broad-based governance \nframework, a better coordination mechanism, and a bottom-up approach to reforms adopted \nunder the program.20 The program has three potential risks (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating measures \nPoor governance and corruption  This risk has been mitigated with the enactment of a new CFT Law, an \nincreased  capacity  of  the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission, \nprocurement reforms, and the implementation of a new integrated \nfinancial management information system in MOF.  \nInefficient policy coordination  This risk has been mitigated by the participation of key stakeholders in \nbetween central and local  ease-of-doing business reform, the leadership role played by BKPM in \ngovernments  policy  coordination,  and  the  participation  of  local  governments  in \nannual  national  development  planning  meetings,  and  pilot-based \ntesting in selected local government. \nWeakened commitment by the  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  with  introduction  of  creative  financing \ngovernment in infrastructure  scheme  to  finance  infrastructure  projects,  promoting  public\u2013private \npartnership  scheme,    increasing  budget  allocation  for  national \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  allowing  multi-year  budget  and \nprocurement schedule \nBKPM = Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal (Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board), CFT = combating the \nfinancing of terrorism, MOF = Ministry of Finance. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n44.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nV.
