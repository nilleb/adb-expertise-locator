The road improvements follow existing alignments.\nAssessment Initial  environmental  examinations  of  nine  selected  core  roads\nshow that the environmental impact is expected to be minimal.\nRationale Efficient  road  transport  and,  in  particular  improved  access  is\nessential for poverty reduction and economic development in Viet\nNam. Past efforts in the road subsector have mainly been directed\ntoward  upgrading  the  national  highway  system,  while  also\nimproving  basic  access  to  the  rural  population  by  improving\ndistrict and commune roads. One missing  part  in  the  network\ndevelopment strategy has been improvement of provincial roads,\nwhich  provide  access  to  the  provincial  capitals,  the  national\nhighway network, and the rural population through the district and\ncommune  roads.  Improving  the  provincial  roads  will  ensure\neffective  transport  and  communication  between  the  rural\npopulation  connected  by  commune  and  provincial  roads  with\nmarket and distribution centers and the national highway network.\nAnother priority is continued reform and institutional strengthening\nof the Viet Nam Road Administration (VRA) to become a modern\nand efficient road management agency. The adopted sector loan\nmodality will support sustainable development of provincial roads\nand allow flexibility in selecting prescreened subprojects forming\npart of the provincial road sector development plan.\nObjectives and Scope The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  economic\ngrowth by improving transport efficiency. The objectives of the\nProject are to (i) improve the provincial road network on both\nsocial and economic grounds, (ii) provide improved access for\npoor and disadvantaged groups living in rural communities, (iii)\nstrengthen  asset  management  capacity  and  maintenance\nprograms  of  VRA  and  the  provincial  departments  of  transport\n(PDOTs),  (iv)  continue  institutional  strengthening  of  VRA  and\nimprove governance in the road subsector, (v) strengthen PDOT\ncapacity  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  resettlement  and\nethnic minority development plans, and (vi) promote private sector\nparticipation  in  the  delivery  of  road  infrastructure  and\nmaintenance.", "iii\nThe Project comprises of (i) a program including an investment\nplan and policy framework to improve about 1,600 kilometers (km)\nof provincial roads in the 18 northern provinces; (ii) assistance to\nproject  management  unit  No.  5  (PMU-5)  and  the  PDOTs  to\nstrengthen their capacity to prepare and implement improvements\nto  and  maintenance  of  provincial  roads;  (iii)  development  and\nintroduction of an action plan to implement a road fund scheme;\n(iv) assistance to introduce new regulation and further institutional\nstrengthening of VRA; (v) assistance to implement and monitor\nresettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plans;  and  (vi)\nconsulting  services  for  preparation,  implementation,  and\nsupervision of civil works; preparation of additional subprojects;\nand capacity building of the PDOTs.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $100.0  million\nequivalent.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Provincial Roads Improvement Sector Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Viet Nam has a relatively extensive road network, but the quality of its roads is generally\npoor. Recognizing this impediment to economic development and poverty reduction, the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), along with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and\nthe World Bank (WB), became involved in the road subsector in the early 1990s. Priority was\ngiven to improving national highway 1, which over its 2,200 kilometers (km) length connects the\nborder of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the north to the southernmost tip of the country. In\nthree subsequent loans,1 ADB financed improvements of various sections of the highway.\nRealizing the need to improve access for the rural population, components for improvement of\nprovincial district and commune roads were also included in two of these loans. Emphasis was\nalso given to institutional development with technical assistance (TA) to start the process of\ndeveloping  the  newly  created  (1998)  Viet  Nam  Road  Administration  (VRA)  into  a  modern\ninstitution and to develop the policy base for sustainable development of roads in Viet Nam.\nADB also helped finance improvements to two high priority Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\nroad improvement projects.2\n3. Now that the improvements of national highway 1 are either completed or under way,\nattention has shifted to other road priorities, specifically provincial, district, and commune roads.\nWhile ADB, the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, JBIC,\nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and WB have shown considerable interest in\nimproving district and commune roads, little attention was paid to improving the connecting\nprovincial  roads.  To  address  this  missing  part  of  the  network  development  strategy,  the\nGovernment of Viet Nam asked ADB to provide project preparatory TA3 covering preliminary\ndesign; economic analysis; and environmental, social, poverty, and other studies needed to\nprepare the proposed Project for provincial roads in the northern part of the country, targeting\nthree of Viet Nam\u2019s poorest regions. Under that TA, a provincial road subsector development\nplan (PRSDP) was prepared. The Government also has a transport investment program, which\nmeets  the  priority  needs  of  the  national  economy.  While  the  Government  has  shown\ncompetence in implementing previous projects, a sector loan is considered appropriate. The\nFact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from 14 May to 1 June 20014 and subsequent missions\nwere  fielded  in  July  and  August  2001  to  conduct  further  policy  dialogue  on  institutional\ndevelopment. The Appraisal Mission was fielded from 9 to 18 October 2001.

D.\nThang, Project Implementation Officer from Viet Nam Resident Mission.", "2\nmultilateral and bilateral agencies, including DFID, JBIC, JICA, and WB; and the findings and\nrecommendations of the feasibility study. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  The Transport Sector\n1.  General\n4. Viet Nam is a poor country. Of the total population of 73 million, some 37 percent live\nbelow the poverty line (1998).5 Although poverty has declined during the last decade, the rate of\ndecline and the incidence vary greatly in the country. Three regions account for the largest\nproportion of poor; two are located in the northern part of the country. Urbanization is starting to\ngrow rapidly, but about 80 percent of the population still live in rural areas. Poverty is largely a\nrural phenomenon with 90 percent of the poor living in rural areas and 34 percent of the rural\npopulation living below the poverty line. However, the urban poor are also vulnerable, suffering\nfrom unemployment, limited access to health and education, and poor living conditions. This\nproblem is being tackled through various assistance and Government projects. Large disparities\nexist between ethnic minority groups and kinh, the national ethnic majority. In 1998, 31 percent\nof kinh were living below the poverty line, compared with 75 percent of the other 53 ethnic\nminorities. In addition, the actual gains in poverty reduction are fragile as many households are\nclassified as just slightly above the poverty line and a small deterioration in their living standard\nis likely to pull them back below.\n5. Several  studies  of  income  poverty6  indicate  that  access  to  physical  infrastructure,\nincluding roads, is one of the most influential factors in reducing poverty. Transport affects the\ngeneral welfare of the poor either directly or indirectly depending on the activities involved.\nExperience shows that road transport often plays an important role in the income generation\nand redistribution process with direct effects, such as providing basic access to education,\nhealth, and markets, and improving access to social and economic opportunities, including labor\nand product markets, schools, and clinics. Road transport also contributes to empowerment of\nthe poor enabling their participation in community and wider decision making, and overcoming\nsocial, cultural, and physical barriers, including geographical isolation. Adequate road transport\nmakes it possible for constituents to get to meeting places and town centers, facilitates the flow\nof information, and so facilitates political and social participation.\n6. With  the  rapidly  increasing  transformation  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  from  a  centrally\nplanned  to  a  socialist  market  economy  system,  the  Government  continues  to  reorient  its\npolicies;  reorganize  public  administration;  and  deregulate  industry,  liberalize  prices,  and\ncommercialize state enterprises in all sectors, including transport. The transition of Viet Nam\u2019s\ntransport sector requires that transport agencies and operators continue to adapt to the new\neconomic  environment  to  improve  transport  efficiency  and  to  create  an  institutional,  legal,\nfinancial, and policy framework conducive to sustainable economic growth.\n2.  Transport Policy and Institutions\n7. At the highest level, the National Assembly makes decisions on major economic policies,\nand approves the national plan and state budget, prepared by the Ministry of Planning and\n                  \n5 Based on Viet Nam living standards surveys (1998) of the General Statistics Office. The poverty line is defined as\n$128 per capita per year in 1998.\n6 For example, see case studies undertaken in Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Morocco, and Viet Nam, prepared by the\nWorld Bank.", "3\nInvestment (MPI). Major policy decisions, transport plans, and large projects, including those for\nexternal financing, are reviewed by the National Appraisal Committee headed by the MPI\nminister.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  responsible  for  the  overall  management  and\ndevelopment of the transport sector (Appendix 2). Four modal administrations within MOT, i.e.,\nVRA, Viet Nam Railways, Viet Nam Inland Waterway Administration, and Viet Nam National\nMaritime Bureau are responsible for roads, railways, inland waterways, and ports respectively.7\nMOT  has  been  slowly  adjusting  its  internal  organization  to  establish  well-defined  modal\nresponsibilities and support departments in all subsectors, but according to Viet Nam 20108\nmore needs to be done especially for roads, such as institutional development and rehabilitation\nof provincial roads. The Planning and Investment Department of MOT undertakes overall policy\ncoordination, programming, and budgeting; and sets investment priorities in the transport sector\nwith support from its Center for Statistics and a number of other institutions.\n8. At  the  provincial  and  district  level,  planning  and  programming  for  transport  sector\ninvestments and operations are vested with the provincial departments of transport (PDOTs),\nwhich are responsible to their respective provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs).9 The PDOTs\nhave no direct responsibility to MOT except for the implementation of some road works on the\nnational  highways,  but  they  have  links  to  MOT  to  carry  out  certain  works  such  as  those\nproposed in the provinces under the Project. While the PDOTs carry out traffic counts, these\ncounts are not yet fully developed into a structured system. Similarly planning and programming\nfunctions within MOT are not yet fully developed to include modern economic analysis methods\nand cost recovery systems in transport sector planning and project selection. Methodology and\nsystems are slowly being introduced through MOT staff participation in recently completed and\nongoing ADB and WB-funded TA that include transport-related studies, seminars, lectures, and\nstudy tours. Formal training and a clear definition of administrative responsibility and authority\nare required for a full appreciation of such techniques and systems.\n3.  Road Network and Traffic\n9. Viet Nam\u2019s transport system is extensive, comprising about 205,000 km of roads, 2,600\nkm  of  railways,  19,500  km  of  navigable  waterways,  seven  main  ports,  three  international\nairports, and 13 smaller airports serving domestic traffic. The core road network is classified into\nnational, provincial, district, and urban roads and others (Appendix 3). The road density of 0.36\nkm/square km compares favorably with that of other developing countries.10 Road transport is\nthe dominant mode, carrying about 70 percent of freight ton-km and about 80 percent of\npassenger-km.  The  demand  for  road  transport  is  increasing  rapidly,  but  traffic  varies\nconsiderably between and within regions. From 1990 to 1997, total transport demand increased\nat an average annual rate of 26 percent for passengers and 35 percent for freight. Over the\nsame period the vehicle fleet increased at an average annual rate of 9 percent (Supplementary\nAppendix A), and as of May 2001 reached around 500,000 motor vehicles (cars, pickups,\nbuses, and trucks). Of the approximately 254,000 trucks of all types in the country, about 30\npercent belong to the private sector. Overall vehicle density, remains, however, low except for\nthe high number of two-wheeled vehicles (7.0 million). The latter vehicles cause problems in\nterms of capacity utilization, traffic hazards, and increasing number of accidents particularly in\nurban areas; their popularity and use is growing rapidly in rural areas. The recorded road\naccidents increased 3.8 times from 1990 to 1999 (para. 48).\n                  \n7  The Civil Aviation Administration was established in February 1993 and now reports directly to MOT.\n8  Viet Nam 2010, Entering the 21st Century, Viet Nam Development Report 2001. ADB, United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), and WB. 2001.\n9  The PPCs are responsible for the government administration of the provinces.\n10 Thailand (0.20) and Malaysia (0.25).", "4\n10. Although the entire road network is relatively extensive, it is substantially deficient in\nquality, mainly because much of the infrastructure in the northern part of the country was\noriginally constructed 50 to 100 years ago. Even with some recent improvements, maintenance\nand rehabilitation are still constrained by a lack of resources. While geometric standards are\ngenerally adequate, pavements were not rehabilitated when needed, the residual strength of\nmost roads is very poor, and while the riding surface is fair because of continual but costly\npothole patching and resealing, major maintenance, rehabilitation, or improvement is urgently\nneeded. In all, 57 percent of national roads and about 25 percent of provincial roads are still in\npoor  condition.  District  and  commune  roads  are  usually  earth  or  gravel  surfaced,  in  poor\ncondition, and not passable to motorized traffic, especially during the rainy season, which\nmakes access to many villages difficult. Some mountainous areas are still inaccessible by road.\nMotor vehicles cannot access 606 (6 percent) of the commune centers.\n4.  Road Management and Administration\na.  Regulation and Organization\n11. While VRA was established in 1993 by decree (interim regulation), the new Road Traffic\nAct was passed in June 2001 and is expected to come into force on 1 January 2002. This\nclearly defines the roles of MOT and other agencies, including at the provincial level, in the\nareas of road planning, construction, maintenance, road transport operations, and road safety.\nMOT is responsible for planning the national road and expressway network and the Government\nis responsible for its approval. Planning for provincial roads is the responsibility of the PDOTs;\nplans are submitted to the PPCs for approval after obtaining MOT recommendations. The\nplanning of urban roads similarly is carried out by the PPCs and submitted to the Government\nfor approval after getting recommendations and advice from both MOT and the Ministry of\nConstruction.  The  planning  of  district  and  lower  roads  is  carried  out  by  agencies  at  that\nadministrative level and approved by the PPCs. The road construction program for the national\nroad  network  is  formulated  by  MOT  and  approved  by  the  Government,  while  that  for  the\nprovincial road network is formulated by the PDOTs and approved by the PPCs after obtaining\nthe written advice of MOT. MOT is also responsible for stipulating the general norms and\nstandards for road management and maintenance of public roads, but is directly responsible for\nthe maintenance program of only the national road network. Responsibility for the maintenance\nprogram of provincial roads is with the PDOTs. The budget for maintenance of provincial roads\nis decided by MOF and MPI after consultation with the PDOTs. MOT is also responsible for (i)\nimplementing road safety engineering, driver training and testing, vehicle inspection, and road\nsafety research; (ii) determining vehicle load limits, and for driver licenses including regulating\ndriver instruction and driver testing; and (iii) setting the parameters for the issuance of licenses\nfor passenger and goods transport, as well as for the management of bus and truck stations,\nalthough the PPCs actually grant licenses to operate transport services and stations.\n12. Because the Road Traffic Act does not spell out the role of VRA, a new permanent\ndecree is needed to define the functions and roles of VRA, which was earlier governed by\ntemporary decrees. This new decree will replace Decree 07/CP (1993), which established VRA,\nand  Decree  167  (1999),  which  decentralized  road  management.  This  is  especially  critical\nbecause the two decrees differ significantly on VRA\u2019s functions. Under Decree 07, VRA is\nresponsible  for  managing  national  road  infrastructure  and  administering  road  transport\nthroughout Viet Nam. However, under Decree 167, VRA is directly responsible for managing\nonly sections of the national roads as entrusted by MOT and the remainder of the national road\nsections are assigned to the control of the PPCs. VRA currently directly manages approximately\n8,000 km representing about 50 percent of the national road network.", "5\n13. VRA is led by a chairperson and has about 17,775 staff organized on a decentralized\nbasis (Appendix 4). It (or its subsidiaries) carries out road maintenance, road toll collection, road\nconstruction, road transport operations, river crossing operations, enforcement of vehicle weight\nlimits, transport consultancies, education and training, engineering design, project management,\nand quarry exploitation. However, VRA has several weaknesses. The TA component of Loan\n1487 (footnote 1) found that (i) road network management responsibilities are unclear and\noverlapping; (ii) strategic planning and programming for roads is lacking; (iii) performance is\ninput and output driven instead of being driven by user or outcome needs; and (iv) VRA is\nlacking key knowledge and capacity.\n14. VRA does not currently fully execute the tasks and functions specified in Decree 07.\nAlthough the decree vests VRA with the responsibility for administering roads throughout Viet\nNam, including road traffic and transport development planning and strategies; VRA information,\ndatabases, and capacity to develop plans, strategies, standards, mechanisms, and policies are\npoor and have not been fully executed. VRA does not have a strong role in influencing road\ninvestment  decisions.  The  project  management  units  (PMUs)  manage  projects  funded  by\ninternational  agencies,  as  well  as  implement  road  rehabilitation,  upgrading,  and  new\nconstruction on national roads with little or no VRA involvement. Even in the field of routine\nmaintenance, VRA is directly responsible for the routine maintenance of only 50 percent of the\nnational road network. The remainder is carried out by the PDOTs, which are also responsible\nfor the provincial road network in their respective provinces. The regional road maintenance\nunits (RRMUs) under VRA carry out routine maintenance either themselves or through their\nroad repair and management companies based on instructions from VRA or MOT, with the\nGovernment regulating the price.\n15. With  the  decentralization  brought  about  by  Decree  167,  no  agency  has  taken\nresponsibility for strategic planning and programming for roads. Planning is primarily a process\nof affiliated units determining local needs with the resulting plan being a consolidation of bottom\nup  inputs  without  adequate  analysis  of  priorities  or  standards  against  which  to  evaluate\nproposals. Although Decree 07 intends for the whole road network to be managed in a unified\nmanner, regardless of the distinction between the road networks and their sources of funding,\nVRA does not provide either the management or input to budgeting to support this goal. VRA\nperformance monitoring is also weak. The road condition of only 2,500 km of national highway\nhas been evaluated. Generally VRA measures its performance in terms of inputs and outputs,\ne.g., amount of money spent or number of licenses issued instead of outcomes like road\ncondition, impact on users, etc. As MOT has limited planning skills, its coverage, and detailed\nplanning and programming function for roads will be transferred to VRA. VRA is developing a\ncomprehensive  road  database  and  is  gaining  experience  through  technology  transfer  from\ninternational consultants. However, VRA\u2019s institutional development needs to be intensified to (i)\noperationalize VRA as the road infrastructure and road transport planning agency, and (ii)\nstrengthen and build capacity at VRA in planning and programming for both maintenance and\ncapital investment activities. This is important because although presently the capital investment\nneeds and priorities are obvious, they will become less so as implementation of the high priority\nprojects is progressively completed.\nb.  Maintenance\n16. MOT through VRA and the RRMUs is responsible for programming the maintenance of\nthe national road network and provides advice to the PDOTs on maintenance of provincial\nroads.  MOT  issues  technical  standards  and  guidelines  for  all  road  classes.  The  road\nmaintenance companies under the RRMUs are responsible for maintaining major national roads\n(46 percent of the national road network), while the PDOTs are responsible for the remainder of", "6\nthe national road network and the provincial, district, and commune roads. While this is not a\nvery efficient or consistent organization for national road maintenance management, alternative\narrangements  with  VRA  playing  a  key  role  are  being  developed  and  discussed  with  the\nGovernment.\n17. A  study  on  developing  a  road  maintenance  strategy11  estimated  that  maintenance\nexpenditures for national and provincial roads cover between 30 and 50 percent depending on\nthe source; thus, maintenance on most of these road networks is being neglected. Despite the\nbudget problem, the PDOTs and RRMUs have mobilized existing resources to maintain vital\nsections  of  these  roads.  Substandard  maintenance  has  resulted  in  relatively  high  surface\nroughness  levels,  even  soon  after  repairs.  In  addition,  the  planning  and  programming  for\nmaintenance  does  not  rely  on  systematic  information  on  road  conditions  and  completed\nmaintenance activities. An appropriate road maintenance management system is needed to\nhelp planners of VRA, RRMUs, and PDOTs decide on major maintenance intervention levels,\ntiming, and monitoring. The study undertook a detailed evaluation of selected national and\nprovincial roads, and recommended that a road inventory management system be put in place\nand used as a basis for investment and maintenance planning. Operationally, WB is providing\nequipment and TA to the RRMUs to implement maintenance and minor road works on a pilot\nbasis. For rural and provincial road maintenance, past ADB projects have assisted in developing\ninitiatives to prepare a maintenance plan and budget, and suggest alternative funding sources.\nHowever, much remains to be done, particularly to strengthen road sector institutions.\nc.  Construction Industry\n18. Prior to the early 1990s, all major road and bridge construction works were carried out\nby force account through six construction corporations directly under MOT. Minor works were\nundertaken by the RRMUs, either through contract or force account. Since then, the MOT\nconstruction companies started operating on a commercial basis and formed joint ventures with\ninternational contractors for most of the large internationally funded construction works at the\nnational  level.  These  joint  ventures  seem  to  have  successfully  completed  large  projects,\nalthough  some  concerns  about  effective  implementation  of  agreements  between  the  joint\nventure partners have been raised. For domestically financed or internationally funded smaller\nworks that allowed local contractors, effective competition has been obtained among the state-\nowned contractors and private small contractors operating autonomously. Thus, relatively large\nparticipation  of  private  sector  entities12  has  been  observed  under  ADB-  and  WB-financed\ncomponents for provincial, district, and commune roads, which are similar to those under the\nProject.\n19. WB  has  recently  raised  concerns  about  the  award  of  contracts  to  state-owned\nenterprises  (SOEs),  and  award  of  civil  work  contracts  to  private  sector  entities  under  the\nongoing Second Rural Transport Project is conditional. A recent ADB mission13 advised the\nGovernment  about  the  constraints  in  awarding  the  works  to  SOEs  and  has  proposed\nconsideration of award on a case-by-case basis until a policy framework is agreed. To address\nthe issue of an appropriate policy framework for SOEs active in the transport sector, a small-\nscale TA is expected to be approved in December 2001. This TA, which will be implemented\n                  \n11 Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick. 1996. Study of Investment and Maintenance Strategy for National and Provincial Roads:\nViet Nam. Funded by DFID (UK).\n12 Under the ongoing WB-financed Second Rural Transport Project, private sector entities had won about 75 percent\nof the contracts, as reported at project appraisal in October 2001.\n13 A  Central  Operations  Services  Office  mission  (in  December  2000)  discussed  the  issue  of  SOEs  with  the\nGovernment and followed up with a letter to the MPI minister regarding the interim process to be adopted for\napproving SOEs for contracts under ADB loans, until an overall strategy for SOE restructuring is agreed.", "7\nduring the first half of 2002, will study the SOEs, and provide recommendations on policy and\nprocurement-related matters. Contractors affiliated with the military are not eligible to bid under\nADB-financed loans due to the preferential treatment they receive in the purchase of subsidized\nraw materials, fuels, equipment, etc.\n5.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures\n20. Road revenues are derived from a wide range of road-user charges. These include\nitems that are (i) purchase related (import duties on new vehicles, and ownership transfer taxes\nwhen vehicles change hands); (ii) ownership related (annual registration fees); and (iii) use\nrelated (import duties on spare parts, tires, and lubricants). In addition, the pump price of fuel\nused for road transport includes an import tax (55 percent for gasoline and 20 percent for\ndiesel). The luxury tax, introduced in January 1996, is set at 15 percent per liter of the after-tax\nimport price of gasoline and of imported vehicles. In January 1995, the Government introduced\na surcharge on fuel (presently D500 per liter) used in road transport, based on ADB-financed\nTA.14 The purpose is to generate funds for the regular repair and maintenance of the country\u2019s\nentire transport system. Of the D500 levy on fuel, approximately D200 is notionally allocated to\nVRA for recurrent expenses. The annual revenue generated from the fuel levy is D2,200 billion,\nbut only about D900 billion (or 41 percent) is actually allocated for road maintenance. The actual\nmaintenance requirements are about D1,800 billion per annum. The total revenue collected\nfrom  road  users,  thus  exceeds  by  a  substantial  margin  the  resources  allocated  by  the\nGovernment to recurrent road maintenance expenditure.\n21. Investment in the transport sector has been about one fourth of public investment in\nrecent years or about 1.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).15 Most capital expenditure\nis funded by external sources, while recurrent expenditures are met through the local budget. As\nanother revenue mechanism, VRA usually charges a toll when a road is improved through\nresealing  or  overlays,  part  of  which  goes  into  the  VRA  budget  for  maintenance  and\nimprovement works. Nevertheless, the total funds available to VRA are less than half of what it\nneeds. VRA has proposed that the Government increase the fuel surcharge from D500 to D900,\nwith D200 of this going to VRA; this is currently part of the road fund debate. Lately VRA\nincreased the number of toll stations to collect more revenues, but these had to be reduced\nfollowing  strong  complaints  from  road  users.  VRA  estimates  that  these  measures  would\nproduce enough revenue to meet their budget requirements including payback of commercial\nloans presently used to meet budget shortfalls.16 All these proposals were made as part of an\neffort by VRA to establish a dedicated road fund or similar, which is being considered by the\nGovernment.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n22. With a goal of significantly increasing real per capita GDP, the Government recognizes\nthat significant constraints must be overcome. The major constraints are (i) the low level of\ndomestic savings, (ii) inadequate and dilapidated physical infrastructure, (iii) the insufficiently\ndeveloped financial system, (iv) the regulatory and institutional framework that is not yet fully\n                  \n14 TA 1996-VIE:Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Transport, for $1.9 million, approved on 29 November\n1993.\n15 JICA. 2000.

The Government is implementing a transport sector reform program that aims to improve\nefficiency and create an institutional and financial framework conducive to economic growth.\nThe major institutional reform is the MOT reorganization, creating four modal administrations\nwith broad responsibilities over their respective subsectors, and VRA responsible for the road\ninfrastructure and road transport subsector (para. 12). The Government intends to (i) strengthen\nVRA by issuing new decrees and regulations; (ii) increase maintenance funding, and introduce\nmodern road maintenance management systems; (iii) strengthen planning capacity and build a\nmodern road asset database; and (iv) improve road safety. MOT and VRA have planned\nsubstantial  investments  for  the  next  10  years  (footnote  15)  costing  about  $11,500  million\nequivalent.\nC.  External Assistance to the Road Subsector\n24. External assistance to the road subsector is substantial and has contributed extensively\nto its development. The subsector has benefited from about 50 projects including both TA and\ninfrastructure development. TA has focused on feasibility studies, area and national master\nplans, and institutional development and capacity building. Hard infrastructure focused initially\non improving the national highways and later improving the provincial, district, and commune\nroads. While the total cost of these TAs and infrastructure projects has not been calculated,\ncommitted external assistance17 for physical rehabilitation of the roads18 totals about $4,000\nmillion (Appendix 5).\n25. In the area of institutional and capacity building, the focus is on (i) road maintenance\ninvestment planning, and resource allocation with the pilot implementation of software to help\ncarry out effective and appropriate strategic planning and programming, as well as identification\nof mechanisms to obtain sustainable funding for maintenance activities; (ii) road and bridge\nmaintenance  management  through  efficient  and  effective  management  of  operations  and\nfinancial  management;  (iii)  organizational  development  of  VRA  by  identifying  options  to\ntransform  VRA  into  an  effective  road  management  organization;  (iv)  human  resource\ndevelopment by assessing VRA\u2019s training needs; and (v) introduction of information technology\nto support VRA management and operational functions. Under TA 1996 (footnote 14), most key\nrecommendations were implemented according to the TA completion report prepared in August\n2001.\n26. Overall  aid  coordination  is  managed  by  periodic  aid  transport  sector  partnership\nmeetings. These meetings allow the exchange of information and views regarding funding\nagency activities and the Government\u2019s goals and objectives. These meetings are interactive\nand provide a good basis for more detailed subsector meetings.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n27. ADB operations in Viet Nam resumed in 1993; two projects have been completed.\nHowever,  project  preparation,  civil  works  procurement  and  consultant  selection,  and\nimplementation are being delayed by a number of common factors. The most important of these\nis the need to obtain high-level approvals, often at the Prime Minister\u2019s level, for relatively minor\nactivities and matters. Actual project implementation, once preparation and procurement have\n                  \n17 As of 31 December 2000. It includes external assistance from ADB, Australia, DFID, JBIC, and WB.\n18 Includes assistance to national highways, provincial and rural roads, and urban transport infrastructure.", "9\nbeen completed, proceeds relatively well although problems within the Ministry of Finance\nregarding delayed payments to contractors are being addressed, if contractors\u2019 cash flows are\nto be maintained. ADB has been helping the Government reduce the impact of this problem,\nthrough TA for capacity building in financial management.19\n28. MOT and the Government are aware of these problems and are addressing them. The\nGovernment has issued a decree20 and related implementation circular21 that clearly spells out\ninternal procedures including time limits for disbursement approval by the parties concerned and\ndirect access to imprest accounts by the executing agencies. A manual on project disbursement\nand accounting under ADB-financed projects was prepared and approved by the Ministry of\nFinance for use on all ADB-funded projects.\n29. The lessons learned in the context of the ADB-financed projects are that each step of\nthe preparation, procurement, land acquisition and resettlement, and implementation processes\nrequire detailed attention by MOT and ADB if the project is to proceed in the form planned and\nis not to be delayed. For procurement, this is being done through advance action for selection of\nsupervision consultants and procurement of civil works contractors. Special attention is also\ngiven  to  appropriate  prequalification  of  civil  works  contractors.  In  line  with  its  policy  on\ndecentralization, the PDOTs will be responsible for awarding civil works contracts with the\nconcurrence of MOT. This significantly reduces the levels of approval previously required. For\nland acquisition and resettlement, using the experience gained from previous ADB- and WB-\nfunded projects, training was provided to the PDOTs, which now ensure that these activities are\nwell planned and resourced, commence early, and are closely monitored. A resettlement policy\nframework and detailed resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared for the core roads, in close\ncoordination with PMU5 and the PDOTs. To properly implement the RPs in time for civil works\nto begin on the core roads, PMU5 and the PDOTs will be staffed with competent resettlement\nspecialists immediately after mobilization of the project construction supervision consultants.\nThrough advance procurement action and implementation of subproject RPs, the Project\u2019s civil\nworks for core roads should be able to commence shortly after the project loan is declared\neffective.  People  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  identified,  compensated,  and  relocated  in\naccordance  with  the  resettlement  plans;  and  a  clear  right-of-way  will  be  available  before\ncommencing civil works.\n30. ADB\u2019s completed first road sector project and the provincial road component of the Third\nRoad Improvement Project required very little resettlement. RP preparation and implementation\nunder  the  Second  and  Third  Road  Improvement  projects  were  inadequate.  The  project\u2019s\nexecuting  agency  did  not  have  adequate  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  resettlement  to\ninternational standards. Sites were handed over to contractors long before the affected people\nwere properly compensated and resettled. Furthermore, although the RP under the Third Road\nImprovement Project provided, for compensation to be paid at replacement cost, payment for\nland was made using Government rates rather than market rates. As a result, those affected\ncould not buy replacement land and asked the Government to provide them with land. The\nGovernment reassessed compensation amounts and provided a grant to relocating households\nsufficient for them to be able to purchase replacement land. Although resettlement under this\nProject will be minimized, people will lose land and houses. Provision will be made to plan,\nimplement, and monitor the resettlement; provide training to the PMUs and PDOTs; and help\nensure that the requirements of the resettlement policy framework and plans are adhered to.\n                  \n19 The TA, which commenced in late 1998 and was implemented over 12 months, assisted the Government to\nimprove the national budget allocation system, and streamlined fund-flow procedures.\n20 Decree 87/CP.\n21 Circular 81/1998/TTLT-BTC-NHNN.", "10\n31. For the Third Road Improvement Project (provincial road component), a review of the\nroad  improvements  in  hilly  areas,  especially  where  the  zone  of  influence  (ZOI)  is  mainly\npopulated by ethnic minorities, revealed that (i) although the improvements are very recent,\nminorities appear to be ill-equipped to take advantage of the opportunities the improved roads\noffer,  because  they  are  subsistence  farmers  with  little  or  no  integration  into  the  market\neconomy; (ii) the people who will benefit in the immediate term are the kinh (the ethnic majority\nin Viet Nam) living in the area; and (iii) road improvements will likely encourage in-migration of\nkinh families and as a result minorities may lose land, and the inequities between the kinh and\nthe minorities will increase. In terms of protecting ethnic minorities' unique culture, traditions,\nand lifestyle, therefore, the Project will identify ways and measures by which the benefits from\nroad improvement can be enhanced and where investment can be made in tandem with other\ninitiatives that cater specifically to the socioeconomic development of ethnic minority groups.\nEthnic minority development plans are being developed under the Project to help minimize\nadverse impacts on minorities.\nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy\n32. ADB\u2019s overarching objective is the reduction of poverty, followed by good governance,\nand private sector development. ADB has worked jointly with 22 Government, financing agency,\nand  nongovernment  organization  partnership  groups  to  prepare  an  economic  development\nstrategy for 2010. For the transport sector this strategy emphasizes a vision that espouses the\n\u201csmooth movement of people and goods in an economically, socially, and environmentally\nsustainable manner.\u201d This general vision is shared by the various stakeholders and specific\nactions to achieve the vision have been identified.\n33. Core to the successful improvement of transport sector management is the continuing\nprocess of institutional reform, specifically continued development of VRA with capacity building\nand institutional strengthening, and improved and secured funding of maintenance. The thrust of\nthe  reforms  are  directed  at  equalization  of  state-owned,  transport-related  enterprises,  an\nappropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  organizational  and  functional  reform  of  the\nministries, including MOT and MPI, and appropriate devolution of responsibility between central\nand local governments. Additionally, adequate financing is needed, not only for the development\nof the transport system, but more importantly, for the operation and maintenance of these\nfacilities. These issues are being addressed by ADB and the aid community.\n34. ADB\u2019s new country strategy and program for Viet Nam during 2001, will guide future\noperations. Based on this, preparation of a new transport sector strategy for the medium-term\n(2002-2006) is planned as part of economic sector work in 2002.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n35. The introduction of modern policies is dependent on development of the policy-making\ninstitutions. Since the mid-1990s, ADB has been actively engaged in institutional strengthening\nefforts to assist MOT and VRA become modern well-managed agencies. This is a continuing\nprocess  and  considerable  progress  has  been  achieved  that  include  (i)  strengthened  legal\nframework and regulation with improved governance, (ii) enhanced financing capability to fund\nroad maintenance, (iii) improved project implementation capability, and (iv) facilitation of private\nsector participation. In brief, VRA was established in 1993 and became responsible for planning,\ninvestment, and maintenance of roads in Viet Nam. The next significant step in legislation was\ntaken when the National Assembly passed the Road Traffic Act in June 2001 to regulate the\nroad infrastructure and road transport subsector. This act will come into force in January 2002.\nAmong other things, the act allows for the entry of the private sector in road transport operations", "11\nand services in the country. In terms of financing of roads, a levy on fuel was introduced in\n1995,  whereby  approximately  D200  of  D500  is  notionally  allocated  to  VRA  for  recurrent\nexpenses. The levy is subject to review and adjustment by the Government. VRA usually\ncharges a toll when a road is improved by resealing or overlays, part of which goes into the VRA\nbudget for further maintenance and improvement works. A proposal to establish a road fund for\nmaintenance has been formulated for discussion within the Government. A few established\nPMUs  have  become  relatively  experienced  in  physical  implementation  and  project\nmanagement, while acquiring knowledge, experience, and capacity in environmental and social\nissues. The earlier use of force account in road projects is discouraged and has been replaced\nwith competitive bidding among public and private sector entities, which have been established\nduring recent years.\n36. Progress has been made in many areas of policy and institutional reform for roads, but\nseveral of key issues remain within the overall transport sector policy dialogue framework of the\nexternal  assistance  community  and  the  Government.  The  proposed  Project  has  policy\ncovenants  that  will  result  in  institutionalizing  modern  planning  and  programming  tools  for\nformulating  the  annual  maintenance  program  for  the  national  highway  network,  including\nsystematic collection of traffic and road condition data, and the implementation and use of\nappropriate software planning at all VRA levels. These efforts will be made sustainable and\ngiven institutional and legal backing with the introduction of permanent decrees specifying\nVRA\u2019s functions and responsibilities in accordance with the new Road Traffic Act. Another policy\ncovenant is to encourage VRA to realign itself to be a modern highway agency by formulating\nand implementing an organizational and financial management improvement plan in line with its\nnew responsibilities. The final policy covenant aims to preserve the asset base of the road\nnetwork by carrying out a study to formulate ways to implement a road fund and to encourage\nthe progressive contracting out of periodic maintenance works. These policy covenants are time\nbound, and include measures to monitor the progress of their implementation. These policy\ncovenants are the first stage in helping Viet Nam to develop an effective and efficient road\ninfrastructure and road transport subsector. A policy action plan for roads under the Project is\ngiven in Appendix 6.\n1.  Strengthening the Legal Framework and Regulation\n37. While the Road Traffic Act has been passed, the focus of ADB\u2019s efforts in institutional\nstrengthening is to increase the capability of VRA to act as the country\u2019s apex body for the\nplanning and programming agency for roads. VRA has been entrusted with preparing seven\ndraft decrees and 18 regulations to complement the new act. They are expected to come into\nforce  in  January  2002.  However,  MOT  must  issue  permanent  decrees  specifying  VRA\u2019s\nresponsibilities and functions and VRA operations under the new act to replace Decree 07/CP\n(Appendix  7).  The  new  act  gives  considerable  authority  to  MOT  with  executive  power  for\nplanning, construction, and maintenance of the national road network, and over vehicle and\ndriver licensing as well as licensing of road transport operations. In addition, MOT has statutory\nadvisory  powers  over  the  planning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  the  provincial  road\nnetworks, although the executive power is with the PPCs. Given the reality that funding for the\nprovincial road network is to a large extent from the central Government, the statutory advisory\npowers  mean  that  the  Road  Traffic  Act  will  allow  MOT  to  be  the  strategic  planning  and\nprogramming authority for the country\u2019s road network. Moreover, it is important for a single\nagency to carry out the strategic planning and programming function for the roads subsector\nbecause funds for road maintenance, upgrading, and new construction are limited and need to\nbe  utilized  effectively  so  that  the  country  derives  the  maximum  possible  benefit.  This  will\nbecome even more important in the future when the obvious choices for investment will no\nlonger be as apparent as they are now. To address this key issue, MOT has agreed to prepare", "12\nand adopt two decrees related to VRA\u2019s functions, responsibilities, and operations, as part of a\ntime-bound action plan, which is part of the proposed Project. These new decrees are expected\nto come into force by December 2002.\n38. ADB is also supporting the Government's efforts22 to strengthen the legal framework and\nregulation for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. ADB has approved a TA23 for\nenhancing the resettlement legal framework and institutional capacity, by which the Government\nwill be assisted to develop a national involuntary resettlement policy to international standards\nby 2003 and assisted with capacity building. This builds upon the considerable work already\ndone by ADB24 and WB.25 Recognizing the TA 5781 (footnote 24) work in Viet Nam, ADB has\nbeen given the mandate to lead the aid coordination group on resettlement issues. The Project\nwill support these efforts by promoting international good practice in resettlement by (i) providing\nconsiderable  capacity  building  of  executing  agencies,  (ii)  promoting  transparency,  and  (iii)\ncoordinating project scheduling to ensure sufficient time is allocated for satisfactory planning\nand implementation of resettlement and clearance of sites prior to the award of civil works\ncontracts.\n2. Institutional Strengthening\n39. Under the TA component of Loan 1487 (footnote 1), several activities were carried out to\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of VRA including (i) the pilot implementation of the highway\ndesign and maintenance model (HDM)-426 in VRA to assist road maintenance planning and\ninvestment  (completed),  (ii)  a  road  maintenance  quality  system  implementation  manual\n(completed), (iii) the study on financial management improvement (completed), and (iv) a study\non  the  establishment  of  a  road  fund  (completed).  In  addition,  WB  funded  the  pilot\nimplementation of a software system (the RoSyPlan) to aid in road maintenance planning and\nsoftware for bridge management (BridgeMAN) in VRA. Thus, VRA is the only agency within\nMOT that has capacity to attempt to carry out the strategic planning and programming functions\nfor the roads subsector for MOT. The two new permanent decrees (para. 37) for VRA will\ndelegate these MOT functions and give the legal basis to VRA to be the strategic planning and\nprogramming authority for roads in the country.\n40. Although a start has been made to improve VRA capacity, more needs to be done so\nthat VRA can carry out its planned functions effectively. An investment study financed by JICA,\nwith the final report issued in July 2000, pointed out, that VRA (i) has weak infrastructure\nmanagement; (ii) lacks capacity for planning, guiding, controlling, and monitoring infrastructure;\n(iii) lacks sufficient funds for maintenance; (iv) has weak monitoring of fund allocation; and (v)\nhas no reliable basis for forecasting future funds. The pilot implementation of the HDM-4,\nRoSyPlan, and BridgeMAN software have not yet been internalized in the planning process for\nroad maintenance. No comprehensive or systematic data collection is in place to obtain traffic\ncensus and road condition data, nor are there in place geometric and capacity design and\n                  \n22 The Government issued Decree 22/CP in 1998 to govern involuntary resettlement, which comes much closer to\ninternational standards.\n23 TA 3727-VIE: Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework and Institutional Capacity, for $310,000, approved on\n24 September 2001.\n24 Under TA-5781-REG: Review of National Resettlement Policies and Experience with Involuntary Resettlement\nProjects, for $831,000, approved on 10 March 1998, a National Resettlement Action Plan was prepared for Viet\nNam setting out detailed recommendations on policy and legal frameworks, institutional arrangements, and\ncapacity building for land acquisition and resettlement.\n25 Under a technical assistance grant (IDF Grant TF 28897VN) (1997), WB assisted the Government to draft an initial\nnational involuntary resettlement policy.\n26 It is the successor to HDM-3, probably the most widely used road planning model.", "13\nmaintenance standards based on a functional classification of the different links of the road\nnetwork and their traffic load.\n41. The  next  steps  would  therefore  involve  helping  VRA  to  (i)  fully  implement  HDM-4,\nRoSyPlan, and BridgeMAN software throughout the country in stages and integrate them into\nthe road maintenance planning process to help allocate scarce maintenance funds on a more\nsystematic basis; (ii) put in place a system to collect traffic census and road condition data so\nthat VRA has a better traffic and condition inventory of the country\u2019s road network for planning\npurposes; (iii) develop appropriate standards for road and bridge maintenance; (iv) develop an\neffective contract management system to contract out the maintenance of the national road\nnetwork (including bridges), which in the future can be used by the PDOTs as well for the\nprovincial road network; (v) ensure sustainable funding of maintenance activities; (vi) implement\nmodern  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  to  improve  accountability  of  funds\nutilized, and to focus on the asset value of the roads under its jurisdiction; (vii) implement\nmodern management practices within the organization, including optimum use of information\nand communication technologies to improve efficiency; and (viii) divest itself of SOEs that are\nincompatible with its new role as a modal agency. While implementing all these will take time,\nthe Government has prepared an institutional strengthening program for VRA, that addresses\nthe key issues and also includes a time-bound action plan under the Project. The individual\ncomponents of this program, which includes capacity building and provision of software and\nsome hardware for the continued institutional strengthening of VRA, will mainly be provided\nunder the institutional component of the ongoing Third Road Improvement Project, but the\nproposed Project also provides for necessary capacity building.\n42. Neither  PMU-5  or  the  PDOTs  are  experienced  in  preparing  and  implementing\nresettlement plans or ethnic minority development plans to international standards. The ability to\ndo this successfully under the Project, will require that (i) PMU-5 and the PDOTs have in-house\nsocial  development  capacity;  (ii)  the  consultants  provide  full-time  social  development\nassistance,  including  formal  and  on-the-job  training  of  counterpart  staff  in  PMU-5  and  the\nPDOTs, (iii) local implementing and monitoring agencies such as Viet Nam Women's Union be\nactive  partners;  and  (iv)  the  consultants  carry  out  formal  and  on-the-job  training  for  all\nresponsible parties.\n3. Road Maintenance and Investment\n43. The  road  subsector  is  a  major  economic  and  social  factor  in  Viet  Nam  with  a\nreplacement value estimated conservatively at D72 trillion or $9,800 million equivalent or 20\npercent of GDP in 1999. Hence proper road maintenance is important to preserve the asset\nvalue and investment to date of this resource. Insufficient road maintenance and investment can\nbe traced to two main problems: inadequate planning and minimal funding.\n44. The Government also needs to make a policy decision for sustainable funding for road\nmaintenance; the present financing model is clearly unsustainable in the long term. In 1999,\ntotal maintenance funds mobilized were $54.8 million. Out of this, $10.4 million (19 percent) was\nfrom the national budget derived from general revenues and fuel levies. An additional $15.0\nmillion  (27  percent)  came  from  toll  revenues.  However,  administrative  expenses  for  toll\ncollection are relatively high with the 1999 figure being $4.3 million (20 percent of the total\ncollection). The largest single source of maintenance financing of $25 million (46 percent) is\nfrom short-term borrowing by VRA to offset late disbursement of national budget allocations.\nVRA is fully responsible not just for the repayment of the principal amount but also for all\ninterest payments;  interest payments will not be covered by future allocations from the national\nbudget. Delays in repayments of loans by VRA under this funding mechanism are contributing", "14\nto the rapidly increasing debt account. The final maintenance funding mechanism is for planned\nperiodic maintenance investment projects for roads with high traffic volumes but not included in\nthe  annual  national  budget.  VRA  through  the  enterprise  function  of  the  regional  road\nmaintenance centers (RRMCs) can borrow from commercial sources. In 1999, $4.3 million (8\npercent  of  total  maintenance  allocation)  was  raised  using  this  mechanism.  Revenues  are\nexpected from toll fees associated with the maintenance improvements, first to pay off the loans\nand later to support general revenue in the national budget. Initial estimates are that this\nrevenue collection is not adequate to cover loan repayments and hence the VRA debt account\nis increasing.\n45. While over half (54 percent) of VRA\u2019s maintenance budget is financed using debt, no\nreal source of funds is available to service this debt. VRA debt due to interest charges will\ncontinue to rise and if not addressed soon could reach unsustainable proportions. Hence the\ncurrent financing model for maintenance is clearly unsustainable, aside from the fact that even\nthe amount raised through all these mechanisms is insufficient for proper maintenance. Thus, it\nis imperative that the Government considers other mechanisms for sustainable financing of\nmaintenance  activities,  such  as  a  road  fund.  When  considering  sustainable  financing\nmechanisms, the sources of revenue, expenditure, and financial control systems need to be\nconsidered to obtain maximum value from the funds. To protect current investment in roads by\nensuring  their  adequate  maintenance,  the  Government  is  considering  how  to  establish  a\ndedicated and adequately financed road fund. MOT has agreed, as part of the action plan under\nthe Project, to a detailed study on potential revenue sources and to develop a mechanism for\nsustainable funding of road maintenance, including introduction of a road fund.\n46. The Government should also assess how the maintenance activities should be carried\nout. At present VRA assigns all routine operation and maintenance work to specific RRMUs and\nregional road maintenance centers based on geographic location. Because this does not entail\nany competition between maintenance units, VRA cannot determine if maximum benefit is\nobtained  from  the  funds  spent.  Allocations  for  periodic  and  unexpected  maintenance  are\nallocated on a project basis with only minimal competition between maintenance units. This too\ngives rise to issues of ineffectiveness. ADB will continue to dialogue with MOT aiming at\ndeveloping  a  truly  competitive  system  for  contracting  out  maintenance  work  so  that  cost-\neffectiveness is maximized.\n4. Road User Charges\n47. Road user charges are a significant source of revenue for the Government in general,\nalthough the charges are low. A 1999 WB study27 found that owners of four-wheel motor\nvehicles pay an annual license fee that is so low ($2 for state-owned cars and $5 for private\nvehicles) it should not be considered a road user charge but rather payment for a service (the\nsafety inspection). Safety inspection fees for buses and trucks are also low \u2013 from $12 to $15.\nSimilarly drivers\u2019 licensing fees are low and should not be considered as road user charges but\nas administrative fees. Significant distortions within the regime of these charges also need to\nbe adjusted or eliminated. Diesel fuel and heavy vehicles are still taxed at a low rate, which\namounts to an indirect subsidy to heavy vehicles and thus provides little incentive for the use of\nefficient vehicles and the efficient use of these vehicles. Also, taxes specific to the weight of the\nvehicle and the damage it causes to the roads need to be introduced. These matters were\nintroduced conceptually to VRA and MOT during implementation of TA 1996 (footnote 14). VRA\nneeds assistance to rationalize a modern, efficiency-based road user charge regime in Viet\n                  \n27 World Bank . 1999.

Report No.\n18748-VN City.", "15\nNam; this will be addressed under the institutional component of the Third Road Improvement\nProject.\n5.  Road Safety\n48. In the past decade, the road accident situation in Viet Nam has worsened considerably\nwith  the  growth  in  motorization.  In  10  years  from  1990  to  1999,  140,278  accidents  were\nrecorded  with  45,196  people  killed  and  153,474  injured.  In  1999,  21,220  accidents  were\nrecorded with over 6,000 fatalities and 25,000 injured persons. Comparison of the accident data\nof 1990 and 1999 shows that the number of accidents increased 3.8 times, fatalities 3.2 times,\nand injuries 5.2 times. The proposed Project\u2019s technical designs will take road safety into\naccount, by providing hard shoulders for separation of bicycle and other nonmotorized traffic,\nand making safe provision for pedestrian movement within populated areas. The major causes\nof accidents are the undisciplined behavior of vehicle operators, bicyclists, and pedestrians; the\nconfusing and dangerous mix of fast- and slow-moving vehicles; and the use of the pavement\nfor various nontraffic related purposes. High accident rates are also attributed to inadequate\nlaws and regulations for vehicles and traffic, their lax enforcement, the poor condition of roads,\nand absence of action to identify and improve hazardous locations.\n49. To address this growing problem, the Government has set up the National Traffic Safety\nCouncil chaired by a vice minister of MOT and consisting of representatives from all relevant\nagencies. The council is drawing up a road safety action plan to reduce the accident rate. This\naction plan will draw upon the work of the consultants, who carried out the Viet Nam Road\nSafety Study as part of the WB\u2019s Highway Rehabilitation Project. ADB involvement in road and\nroad safety issues will continue through project design and implementation, and continuing\ndialogue  with  concerned  Government  officials.  ADB  along  with  WB  is  supporting  the\nGovernment through the Global Road Safety Partnership, which includes a series of road safety\nactivities in Viet Nam, including education and awareness campaigns.\n6.  Transport Sector Coordination and Partnerships\n50. JICA chairs ongoing partnership meetings, with MOT as the cochair. This has helped in\nthe macro sense to clarify who is doing what more precisely. Nevertheless, more coordination is\nneeded to ensure that all participants are working toward the same goals, while collaborating\nmore effectively and coordinating more efficiently. WB is supporting the Rural Transport Unit\nwithin MOT, which is addressing several issues, including preparing a synthesis of existing\ninformation  to  help  provide  guidance  on  needs,  priorities,  technical  choices,  and  the\nresponsibilities of different agencies.\n51. During discussions with MOT in August 2001, the ADB mission submitted a concept\npaper to MOT to establish a transport sector official development assistance partnership. The\nobjective of this proposal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of official development\nassistance for the transport sector to ensure that investments by the different agencies are\ncomplementary in nature with appropriate synergy among the different components so that\noptimum benefits are derived to enhance the national economic and social development goals.\nThe concept paper proposed that a small secretariat be established to service the transport\nsector official development assistance partnership. About $140,000 will be required and ADB\nhas offered $50,000 as its contribution; other multilateral and bilateral agencies are expected to\ncontribute.\n52. Viet Nam was selected to be one of the pilot countries for the introduction of the\ncomprehensive development framework championed by WB. So far this approach has been", "16\nimplemented in a partial and selective way. The process can be expected to evolve gradually\nover the medium-term as simultaneous and thorough analysis of issues and coordination of\noperations in all sectors will place excessive demands on the Government and the assistance\ncommunity. For transport, aid coordination has been a regular feature for the last five years. The\nbasis and depth of the coordination has been getting stronger and becoming more effective.\nADB  is  an  active  partner  in  the  coordination  process  and  the  transport  sector  official\ndevelopment assistance partnership is expected to assist in these efforts.\n7.  Road Construction Industry and SOEs\n53. In recent years, ADB has been engaged along with WB in SOE reform as part of an\nenterprise reform and corporate governance program.28 One purpose is to promote competitive\npractices with maximum private sector involvement for ADB-financed projects and to support\nSOE corporatization or privatization. Thus, small private contractors are being encouraged to\nrehabilitate  district  and  provincial  roads  under  the  proposed  Project.  During  2001,  ADB  is\nexpected to  approve a TA, which will address the policy framework and procurement-related\nmatters  for  SOEs  active  in  the  transport  sector  (para.  19),  and  support  private  sector\nparticipation.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n54. Efficient  road  transport,  and  improved  access  in  particular,  is  essential  for  poverty\nreduction and economic development. Past efforts in the road subsector have mainly been\ndirected at upgrading the national highway system, while also improving basic access to the\nrural population by improving the lower level district and commune roads. One missing part in\nthe network development strategy has been improvement of provincial roads, which provide\naccess to the provincial capitals, to the national highway network, and to the rural population\nthrough  the  district  and  commune  roads.  Improvement  of  the  provincial  roads  will  ensure\neffective transport and communication between the rural population connected by commune\nand provincial roads with market and distribution centers and the national highway network.\nAnother priority is continued reform and institutional strengthening of VRA to become a modern\nand  efficient  road  administration  agency.  The  adopted  sector  loan  modality  will  support\nsustainable  development  of  provincial  roads  and  allow  flexibility  in  selecting  prescreened\nsubprojects forming part of the PRSDP.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n1.  Objectives\n55. The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  economic  growth  by  improving\ntransport efficiency. The Project\u2019s objectives are to (i) improve the provincial road network on\nboth social and economic grounds; (ii) provide improved access for poor and disadvantaged\ngroups living in rural communities; (iii) strengthen asset management capacity and maintenance\nprograms of VRA and the PDOTs; (iv) continue institutional strengthening of VRA and improve\ngovernance in the road subsector; (v) strengthen PDOT capacity to prepare, implement, and\n                  \n28Loan  1733-VIE(SF): State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Program,  for  $60  million,\napproved on 21 December 1999.", "17\nmonitor resettlement and ethnic minority development plans; and (vi) promote private sector\nparticipation in the delivery of road infrastructure and maintenance.\n2.  Scope\n56. The Project comprises (i) a program including an investment plan and policy framework\nto improve about 1,600 km of provincial roads in the 18 northern provinces; (ii) assistance to\nPMU-5 and the PDOTs to strengthen their capacity to prepare and implement improvements to\nand maintenance of provincial roads; (iii) development and introduction of an action plan to\nimplement  a  road  fund  scheme;  (iv)  assistance  to  introduce  new  regulation  and  further\ninstitutional strengthening of VRA;29 (v) assistance to implement and monitor resettlement and\nethnic minority development plans; and (vi) consulting services for the preparation, design,\nimplementation,  and  supervision  of  civil  works;  preparation  of  additional  subprojects;  and\ncapacity strengthening of the PDOTs.\n3.  Project Area and Components\n57. The project area covers three of Viet Nam\u2019s seven regions: Northern Mountains and\nUplands (northeast and northwest), Red River Delta, and North Central Coast. Of the 18 project\nprovinces, 15 are located in the Northern Mountains and Uplands, two in the Red River Delta,\nand one in the North Central Coast. The Northern Mountains and Uplands and the North Central\nCoast regions are two of the poorest in the country and the incidence of poverty in the project\narea is high with 18 percent of households in the study area being poor compared with 13\npercent in all of Viet Nam.\na.  Provincial Roads Component\n58. This component involves improvement works for 1,600 km of provincial roads selected\nfrom  a  list  of  2,850  km  proposed  by  the  PDOTs,  based  on  the  PRSDP  (Supplementary\nAppendix B). The proposed improvements include building up or restoring the embankment,\nstrengthening  gravel  pavements  or  providing  gravel  base,  providing  bituminous  surfacing,\nimproving existing and/or providing additional side and cross drains, repairing existing minor\nbridges, and constructing new bridges as required. The standard formation width of 6.5 meters\nwith a 3.5-meter surface treated carriageway under class V will be generally followed unless the\nexisting road width and traffic levels require a higher category of road. Initial studies have shown\nthat almost all of the proposed roads are economically feasible for improvement to class V or\nhigher with traffic ranging from 10 to 400 conventional motor vehicles per day. All roads have a\nstrong social focus as they serve areas inhabited mainly by the rural poor who could benefit\nsubstantially from improved access. The design standards and specifications will be simple and\ncomprise mainly small contracts using largely labor-based construction techniques. Involvement\nof small-scale domestic contractors will be encouraged. Little or no change is planned for\nexisting horizontal and vertical alignments.\nb.  Support to PMU-5 and the PDOTs\n59. The  Project  provides  for  support  to  the  implementing  agencies,  PMU-5,  and  the\nprovincial PMUs within the PDOTs in each of the project provinces. In addition to budgetary\nsupport to  help with incremental expenses such as temporary personnel, office equipment,\nsupplies, and office and vehicle operating expenses, the Project provides for on-the-job and\n                  \n29The  consultant  under  Loan  1487-VIE  made  several  recommendations  for  VRA  development.  Funds  for\nimplementing road funds and VRA capacity building are available under Loans 1487 and 1653 (footnote 1).", "18\nformal  training  of  the  staff  of  these  agencies.  The  training  will  build  on  the  institutional\nstrengthening already experienced under previous projects funded by ADB, DFID, JBIC, and\nWB in the project provinces, and will be undertaken by the consultant as part of the capacity\nbuilding effort under the Project. This will help ensure that the implementing agencies have the\nrequired capacity and other resources to effectively and efficiently carry out this and future\nprojects.\nc.  Road Fund\n60. The Project will seek to develop and introduce a road fund to ensure sustainable funding\nof  road  maintenance.  Recommendations  for  this  were  prepared  under  the  institutional\nstrengthening component of the ongoing Second Road Improvement Project (footnote 1). A\ndetailed study, covering possible sources and mechanisms, for funding of road maintenance,\nwill be carried out under the institutional component of the ongoing Third Road Improvement\nProject (footnote 1) as part of the action plan (further details at Appendix 6) adopted by the\nGovernment for the proposed Project.\nd.  Development of VRA\n61. As the highway agency for the road subsector in MOT, VRA is expected to carry out\nmany  of  the  functions  under  the  Road  Traffic  Act  that  fall  within  the  purview  of  MOT.\nRecommendations  in  this  regard  have  been  prepared  under  the  institutional  strengthening\ncomponent of the ongoing Second Road Improvement Project. As part of the Project, the\nGovernment  has  adopted  an  action  plan  to  ensure  VRA  achieves  its  intended  role  and\nfunctions.  The  action  plan  includes  strengthening  the  legal  framework  and  institutional\nstrengthening of VRA, improvement of road management practices, and maintenance funding\n(further details at Appendix 6). The action plan was officially submitted to ADB before loan\nnegotiations.\ne.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Ethnic Minority Development\n62. The Project will include the preparation, implementation, and monitoring of an RP for\neach subproject road requiring such a plan according to the applicability condition as defined in\nthe Project\u2019s resettlement framework. The RPs will include a program for providing assistance to\nethnic minority communities for all subproject roads where ethnic minority people live within the\nZOI30 of each road. This will be done in accordance with the resettlement framework, which was\nprepared for the Project in accordance with ADB's policies on involuntary resettlement and\nindigenous people.31 The Government and ADB agreed on the Resettlement Framework during\nloan negotiations. Strengthening of the executing and implementing agencies is essential as is\nthe formal and on-the-job training that will be provided by the consultants. An RP has been\nprepared for a sample subproject.\nf.  Consulting Services\n63. Consulting  services  will  include  construction  supervision,  environmental  impact\nassessment and monitoring, resettlement and ethnic minority development supervision and\nmonitoring,  and  a  substantial  training  component  for  government  officials  and  domestic\nconsultant  personnel  involved  with  the  Project.  A  consultant  will  also  be  responsible  for\n                  \n30 ZOI is defined as all communes through which a subproject road passes, and any other commune located in close\nproximity to a subproject road.\n31 ADB. 1998.

This involves conducting surveys, and preparing engineering\ndesigns and resettlement and ethnic minority development plans, as needed.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n64. The estimated cost of the Project is $100.0 million equivalent, including civil works,\nconsulting services, land acquisition, resettlement, support to PMU-5 and the PDOTs, and\ncontingencies. The cost comprises $36.6 million in foreign exchange (37 percent of the total\ncost),  including  $2.90  million  for  service  charges  during  construction,  and  $63.4  million\nequivalent  (63  percent)  in  local  currency  costs.  The  costs  are  based  primarily  on  rough\nestimates for typical roads in the terrain encountered in the project provinces based on the\nfeasibility study prepared by the TA consultant. The estimate assumes that the civil works will\nbe carried out by local contractors under supervision of international and domestic consultants.\nTable 1 summarizes the cost estimates (a cost estimate for the nine core roads is in Appendix\n8).\nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\nCost Estimate Financing Plan\nForeign Local Total\nCategory Exchange Currency Cost ADB Government\nA.

Financing Plan\n65. The Project\u2019s financing plan is set out in Table 2. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan\nof  $70.0  million  equivalent,  denominated  in  special  drawing  rights  from  its  Special  Funds\nresources with an amortization period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years with an\ninterest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter. The loan will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project, estimated at", "20\n$36.6 million (about 37 percent of the total project cost) and  $33.4 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost (about 33 percent of the total project cost). The latter will include the entire local\ncurrency cost of the consulting services, incremental expenditure, and a portion of the local\ncurrency cost of the civil works. The Government will finance the remaining $30.0 million\nequivalent, which will cover land acquisition and resettlement including the ethnic minority\ndevelopment component of the RP, independent monitoring of RP provisions, local currency\ncontingencies, the remaining portion of the civil works cost, and all taxes and duties.\n66. The amount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal situation in Viet\nNam.  The  country  is  one  of  the  poorest  in  the  world,  and  the  Government  has  difficulty\nmobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  its  own  resources  to  meet  all  development  commitments,\nincluding rehabilitating and upgrading critical physical and social infrastructure. Although the\nneed to generate domestic resources to finance investments for sustaining economic growth is\nwell recognized, the country has not yet developed the resource base necessary to adequately\nfinance  the  required  level  of  investments  without  external  assistance.  Under  the  current\ncircumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting pressure on development\nprograms; thus external support is needed to meet some of the local costs of projects. In line\nwith the ADB policy to help provide local currency cost financing, particularly for projects that\naddress priority poverty concerns in the economically less-developed regions, about 48 percent\nof the loan will be for that purpose.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 36.6 33.4 70.0 70.0\nGovernment 0.0 30.0 30.0 30.0\nTotal 36.6 63.4 100.0 100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\nE.  The Executing Agencies\n67. MOT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  PMU-5  within  MOT  will  assume  overall\nresponsibility for project implementation.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  The Implementing Agencies\n68. The PDOTs will be the Implementing Agencies in their respective provinces. Under\nguidance from PMU-5, the PDOTs have established provincial PMUs that will be responsible for\nawarding  civil  works  contracts  and  day-to-day  implementation.  This  is  in  line  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s policy for decentralization of project responsibilities to the provinces and supports\nthe recent Government initiatives to devolve more autonomy to the provinces to manage their\nown  finances.  PMU-5  is  presently  the  implementing  agency  for  a  JBIC-funded  road\nimprovement project. Although it has gained considerable experience in implementing externally\nfinanced projects, assistance is warranted to make it more familiar with ADB procedures and\nimplementation  requirements.  While  the  PDOTs  have  experience  with  externally  financed", "21\nprojects,32 they will require support and assistance from PMU-5 and the project consultants to\ndevelop the necessary skills to manage and implement the civil works and RPs effectively, as\nwell as for subproject preparation. Project coordination will be the responsibility of MOT\u2019s vice-\nminister,  assigned  responsibility  for  the  Project.  A  separate  project  preparation  and\nimplementation manual prepared by the TA consultant will be used by PMU-5 during project\nimplementation. The Project\u2019s organizational arrangements are shown in Appendix 9.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n69. A summary implementation schedule, based on a detailed schedule prepared by PMU-5\nand ADB, is provided in Appendix 10. The schedule assumes that the Project will be declared\neffective in March 2002. The nine core roads will be ready for contract awards shortly after that\ntime. The subprojects for the remaining roads will be implemented in about four tranches, each\ninvolving subproject preparation, bidding and award of civil works, and construction. Due to its\ncritical role in implementation, advance action has been approved for procurement of consulting\nservices and civil work preconstruction activities (up to award of contracts) for the core roads.\nThe Project is envisaged to be completed by June 2006.\n3.  Subproject Preparation\n70. The core roads represent a sample of the universe of provincial roads prepared in a form\nthat is acceptable for ADB approval. Specifically, work on the nine core roads has been found to\nbe technically feasible, economically justified, and socially and environmentally responsible.\nWhile most of the data needed for selecting and prioritizing the project roads was prepared\nunder the TA, it did, however, not provide the full documentation required for approval of\nsubprojects in addition to the core roads. These data will be prepared under the Project. While\nthe selection of subproject roads will be at MOT\u2019s discretion, ADB approval will be required prior\nto tendering.\n71. To be eligible for financing under the loan, the subprojects submitted by PMU-5 must be\n(i) technically justified and economically viable,33 (ii) environmentally and socially responsible,\n(iii) part of the PRSDP, and (iv) in compliance with all applicable ADB guidelines. MOT-PMU-5\nwill seek ADB approval by submitting a request for subproject approval that will include (i) cover\nsheet, (ii) basic data sheet, (iii) location map, (iv) an initial environmental examination (IEE) or\nenvironmental impact assessment in ADB format, (v) the Government\u2019s environment approval,\nand (vi) an RP, including an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) component, in a format\nacceptable to ADB (Appendix 11).\n4.  Civil Works Component\n72. Civil works, based on the roads in the PRSDP, will be implemented through a number of\nsmall contracts, each valued at between $200,000 and $1,000,000. Each province will have\nabout three to six of these contracts, for a total of about 100 contracts. Contracts will be\nprocured using local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB and will follow ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  In  essence,  these  procedures  follow  closely  the  procedures\nadopted for the provincial road components of the ongoing ADB-financed Second and Third\n                  \n32Ten of the 18 provinces have some experience through mainly district and commune road improvement projects\nfunded by DFID, JICA, and WB.\n33 The economic internal rate of return will exceed 12 percent for eligible subprojects.", "22\nRoad Improvement projects and WB-financed rural transport projects.34 The bidding procedures\nwill use a two-envelope modality,35 as adopted for ongoing similar projects (footnote 1).\n73. Detailed  procurement  procedures  and  procurement  documentation  have  been\ndeveloped by the TA consultant in consultation with PMU-5 and the PDOTs, based on previous\nexperience of ADB and WB-financed projects of a similar type. After MOT review and approval,\nthe procedures and documentation will be submitted to ADB for approval before the first bids\nare invited. The procedures will provide for bids to be invited in each province in annual\nbatches. A contractor\u2019s performance in an earlier phase will determine whether the company\ncan participate in bidding for the subsequent batches. The number of contracts a contractor can\nbe awarded will be determined on the basis of the company\u2019s bid capacity.\n5.  Consulting Services\n74. The supervision consultant will be an association of international and domestic firms,\nwith the former the lead in the association. The consultant will be selected in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Staffing  inputs  will  be  about  160  person-months  of\ninternational consultants and about 2,000 person-months of domestic consulting. Expertise\nrequired will include project and contract management; economic evaluation, especially of low\nvolume  roads,  materials;  and  pavement  engineering;  structural  engineering;  social  and\nenvironmental impact assessment and monitoring; resettlement planning and implementation;\nand ethnic minority development expertise (Supplementary Appendix C). The overall period of\nthe services will be about 51 months. Furnished office facilities and utilities, vehicles, and\nequipment required by the supervision consultant will be provided under the Project. Field\noffices and material testing laboratories with utilities and motorcycles required by construction\ninspectors will be supplied through the civil works contracts.\n6.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\na.  Reports\n75. Prior to beginning the civil works under the Project, PMU-5 will provide ADB with brief\nmonthly progress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. These reports will be due at\nthe end of each month. Once the project supervision consultant is appointed, the consultant will\nprepare brief monthly progress and quarterly reports for PMU-5 and ADB. The format of these\nreports will be discussed and agreed to prior to commencing the consulting services. Once the\nworks are completed, PMU-5 will arrange for the project consultant to submit a project completion\nreport within three months of project completion.\nb.  Records and Accounts\n76. PMU-5 will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services\nfinanced from the loan proceeds and from counterpart funds; to identify the use of these goods\nand services for the Project; to record project progress, including its cost; and to reflect in\naccordance with consistently maintained sound accounting principles, its operations and financial\ncondition.\n                  \n34 Rural Transport Project and Rural Transport Project II financed by WB.\n35 The first envelope contains prequalification data, and the second envelope, which will only be opened for eligible\nand prequalified bidders, contains bid prices.", "23\n77. These  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by\nauditors acceptable to ADB. PMU-5 will provide ADB with the audited reports and related financial\nstatements, in English, not later than nine months after the end of the fiscal year to which they\nrelate.\nc.  Imprest Account\n78. Imprest account procedures will be used for civil works and also for PMU-5 and PDOTs\u2019\nincremental expenditures under the loan. An imprest account will be established with PMU-5 and\noperated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Second generation imprest\naccounts, following the same requirements as the main imprest account, will be established in the\nPDOTs to facilitate flow of funds to the provinces responsible for awarding and administering the\ncivil work contracts.\nd. Midterm Review\n79. ADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. In particular, midway\nthrough project implementation (end 2003), ADB and senior Government and provincial officials\nwill undertake a detailed review of the Project and its implementation status. This review will cover\nthe entire project scope to determine whether any adjustments to its proposed procurement and\nmanagement  arrangements  are  warranted.  The  review  will  also  address  any  outstanding\nprocurement problems, and financing and scheduling matters.\ne. Project Performance Monitoring\n80. PMU-5, with the assistance of the project consultant, will carry out project performance\nand  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  compiling  and  analyzing  appropriate  traffic,  and\nsocioeconomic and other data for the project roads. For this purpose, PMU-5 carried out a\nbaseline survey in 2001 for roads in four provinces with assistance of the TA consultants. This will\nbe followed by data collection and other surveys once during implementation and immediately\nafter the project roads have been completed and handed over. The findings and supporting data\nwill be incorporated in the project completion report. Systems for recording data and statistics for\nsuch monitoring will be established as part of the project implementation arrangements with\nassistance of the project supervision consultants. PMU-5 assisted by the project supervision\nconsultants  will  evaluate  the  project  benefits  in  accordance  with  a  schedule  and  terms  of\nreference to be mutually agreed with ADB.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental\n81. In most cases, selected roads will be improved within the existing alignment, which has\nbeen in place for a long time. The ecology of the area surrounding these roads has already\nadjusted to any negative impacts caused by the road\u2019s existence. Minor realignment will be\nincorporated in the design of a few specific subprojects where the existing road passes near\nsensitive areas, such as protected nature reserves and cultural-historic sites. Where an existing\nroad passes near a sensitive site, the road subproject will include appropriate supplemental\nprotective  measures,  such  as  fencing,  checkpoints,  and/or  demarcation  of  the  adjacent  or\nnearby site.\n82. Under the TA, IEEs were carried out for the nine core roads in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  the  Environmental  Impacts  of  Infrastructure  Projects  and  Environmental", "24\nAssessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank. A summary IEE was prepared for\none of the nine core roads (first subproject) (Appendix 12). All subsequent subprojects will\nadhere to the same ADB IEE and summary IEE procedures.\n83. PMU-5, in cooperation with the 18 PDOTs, will ensure adherence to the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental  regulations,  including  registration  and  preparation  of  an  environmental\nassessment report for each subproject in accordance with the Circular Letter on Setting Up and\nAppraising the Environmental Impact Assessment Report for Investment Project.36 This requires\nPMU-5  to  obtain  approval  of  individual  subproject  environmental  impact  reports  from  the\nMinistry  of  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment,  and  specifically  from  its  National\nEnvironment Agency.\n84. The Project\u2019s subproject designs and contract documentation will provide details of the\nnecessary environmental mitigation measures, and the contractual means by which they are to\nbe included during construction. In most cases, the nature of subproject civil works will be of\nslight  environmental  significance  and  pertain  to  standard  good  environmental  engineering\npractices.  Only  where  subproject  roads  pass  through  or  near  sensitive  sites  will  special\nenvironmental considerations be necessary, but these are anticipated to be minor in nature. The\nProject\u2019s  supervision  consulting  services  include  environmental  impact  monitoring  and\nmitigation provisions.\n2.  Social\na. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n85. The Project will require acquisition of approximately 74 hectares of land for the nine core\nsubproject roads and approximately 415 hectares for the remaining 90 subproject roads. The\ncost of preparing and implementing RPs for all subproject roads is estimated at approximately\n$3.5 million. Land acquisition and resettlement under the Project will be avoided as much as\npossible, however, even marginal land acquisition will be undertaken in accordance with the\nprocedures established in the resettlement framework to ensure that adverse effects of the\nproject are addressed within a process that protects the rights of people affected by the Project,\nincluding ethnic minorities, where these are living within the ZOI of a road.\n86. In compliance with the requirements of ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement for\npreparation  of  a  sector  loan,  a  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  13)  applicable  to  all\nsubprojects and an RP for one sample subproject  (Appendix 14) have been prepared and\napproved by the Government. For each of the eight remaining core roads, an RP will be\nprepared and approved by the Government prior to loan effectiveness. The PDOTs will be\nrequired to prepare and submit to ADB for approval an RP for each of the other subprojects\nonce the detailed design is available.\n87. With the assistance of the construction supervision consultants, PMU-5 will arrange\nthrough  the  PDOTs  for  the  required  land  to  be  acquired,  and  for  those  affected  to  be\ncompensated and, if required, relocated and resettled, and incomes rehabilitated in accordance\nwith the Government's procedures and ADB's requirements as defined in ADB's policy on\ninvoluntary resettlement. Where the Government's procedures and ADB's requirements differ,\nthe latter will apply. The PDOTs will not begin to implement the RPs until after the construction\n                  \n36 Under review by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment and MPI is the Joint Circular Environment\nImpact Assessment of Plans and Investment Projects. Fifteen days after this document is signed by both ministries\nit will supercede the above mentioned legislation. Essentially the same as the existing Circular Letter, the new one\nwill have greater authority due to backing by both ministries.", "25\nsupervision consultants have been mobilized to oversee RP implementation. PMU-5 will engage\nan independent domestic agency acceptable to ADB to monitor compliance with the RPs and\nresettlement framework.\n88. Reflecting the importance that ADB places on the careful and effective implementation of\nthe RPs, the Loan Agreement contains a number of covenants related to this issue. The\ncapacity of PMU5 and the PDOTs will be strengthened to enable effective and timely RP\npreparation and implementation. The construction supervision consultants will include full-time\nresettlement specialists to guide and supervise RP preparation and implementation. ADB will\nalso monitor the social aspects of the Project through regular review missions by resettlement\nand social development specialists. Furthermore, the Project will promote international good\npractice in resettlement, thereby supporting efforts made by the Government, ADB, DFID, and\nWB.\nb. Plans for Ethnic Minorities\n89. The term ethnic minorities refer to those groups that are different from the national\nmajority group of kinh. However, in the project context while the kinh are the national majority, in\nmany of the provinces in the project area this group constitutes the minority of the population. In\nthe project area, 30 ethnic groups make up 49 percent of the population. Three of the core\nroads have populations made up of more than 95 percent ethnic minorities.\n90. In general, the Project seeks to avoid displacement of any people. In most cases, people\nwhose houses need to be moved will be able to move just behind the right-of-way, thereby\nminimizing the impact. In exceptional cases where displacement cannot be avoided, particular\ncare will be given in the compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of displaced people that\nare ethnic minorities. Extensive social preparation and mobilization for ethnic minority groups\nwill take place prior to any physical resettlement.\n91. The Project will not have any negative impact on specific ethnic minority groups located\nin the project areas. The selection criteria for the subprojects are designed to ensure that they\ndo not adversely impact ethnic minorities. The Project will identify ways and measures in which\nthe benefits from road improvement can be enhanced and where investment can be made in\ntandem with other initiatives that cater specifically to the socioeconomic development of ethnic\nminority  groups.  This  will  be  done  by  means  of  participatory  detailed  design  of  minority\ndevelopment plans (EMDPs) under the guidance of the consultants. Such efforts will include (i)\nsmall-scale community infrastructure aimed at improving access of the poor and excluded, such\nas  trails,  footbridges,  and  markets;  (ii)  participatory  agricultural  extension  to  increase\nproductivity;  and  (iii)  support  for  credit  utilization.  Gender  concerns  of  relevance  to  ethnic\nminorities will also be addressed by the Project actively facilitating the processes whereby\nwomen are involved in identifying, designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the\nEMDPs.\n92. The resettlement framework (Appendix 13) was prepared under TA 3455 (footnote 3)\nand includes a component for ethnic minority development, which will be applicable in cases\nwhere there are ethnic minority people living within the zone of influence of a subproject road.\nThe Government has approved the framework. In accordance with the framework, the sample\nRP for one core road (Appendix 14) makes provision for an EMDP for communities within the\nZOI of that road. Prior to loan effectiveness, an EMDP component will be prepared and included\nin the RPs for the other core roads where there are ethnic minority people living  within the ZOI\nof those roads. The PDOTs will be required to prepare and submit RPs to ADB for approval:\nthe EMDP component must be included for each subproject as required and in accordance with", "26\nthe  criteria  stipulated  in  the  framework.  The  EMDP  component  will  be  prepared  and\nimplemented following ADB's indigenous people policy.\nc. Health Measures\n93. Transport  corridors  can  have  significant  impacts  on  the  transmission  of  sexually\ntransmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.37 Truck drivers operating along the roads and commercial\nsex workers are identified as two of the major high-risk groups. As the Project will provide\nimproved transport links within the country, the risk of STD transmission may increase. Most\nlabor will be from local areas and will return home at night thus eliminating or minimizing the\nneed for campsites that would encourage sex workers to establish and operate in those areas.\nMost of the roads are short and traversed in a short time. Their improvement is not likely to lead\nto the establishment of increased sex trade.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n94. The methodology for economic analysis presented in Appendix 15 used the traditional\nevaluation method where existing and future vehicle operating cost savings are determined and\nanalyzed to determine if the recommended improvement is warranted in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Projects. The highway design and maintenance\nmodel was adjusted to the country\u2019s conditions and used to calculate vehicle operating costs\nand savings. The main inputs to this are vehicle operating, construction, and maintenance\ncosts, along with resettlement, supervision, and physical contingency costs. As the roads are in\n18 very poor provinces of northern Viet Nam, they were evaluated and ranked in social and area\neconomic terms. This ranking helps to set priorities and ensure that roads serving the poorest\nareas will be candidates for improvement.\n95. The provinces have a combined total of 8,100 km of provincial roads. These were\ninitially screened to eliminate roads that were recently improved; are scheduled for improvement\nor in good condition, or have very low priority in terms of low traffic volume. This reduced the\nlength to 2,800 km. Based on a socioeconomic ranking, these roads were then reduced to 1,600\nkm that have high priority in socioeconomic terms; these form the basis of the Project. To\nprepare the project roads, an initial set of core roads was selected to represent different parts of\nthe  project  area  reflecting  differences  in  topography,  geology,  and  social  and  other\ncharacteristics. The core roads were subject to a complete economic evaluation using detailed\ndesign, and vehicle operating costs, all adjusted according to appropriate shadow prices and\nconversion factors. Traffic growth rates were derived from the relationship between GDP and\nthe elasticity of transport demand for motorcycles, passenger transport, and cargo. These were\nthen adjusted to reflect project area characteristics. This yielded annual growth rates ranging\nfrom 5 to 13 percent up to 2005, and then declining to 4 to 5 percent thereafter.\n96. The project roads are generally lightly traveled with motorcycles comprising about 80\npercent of the traffic on many roads. The level of improvement will mainly be to class V roads,\nand incorporates a formation width of 6.5 m and a sealed carriageway of 3.5 m. Analysis of the\nmaintenance costs between gravel and sealed surface shows that sealed roads provide a better\nriding surface longer and given the effects of heavy rainfall common to the project area, the cost\nof maintaining sealed roads is less than that of gravel-surfaced roads.\n                  \n37  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.", "27\n97. Motorized vehicle operating cost savings were then calculated and included person-time\nsavings. Benefits include savings to nonmotorized traffic such as bicycles or bullock carts, but\nbenefits  to  generated  or  diverted  traffic  were  excluded.  Nonmotorized  traffic  generally\ncontributed less than 5 percent to total benefits. These savings were then balanced against the\nestimates of the necessary costs of improvement to bring the roads up to a standard that would\nensure year-round access. The results of the economic evaluation for the core roads are\npresented in Table 3.\nTable 3: Summary of Economic Evaluation for the Core Roads\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Switching Value in Percent\nRoad Base 20%\nNumber Case Capital 20% VOC Combination Switching\nEIRR Cost Savings Case1 + Value\nIncrease Reduction Case 2 at 12 percent\n(Case 1) (Case 2) Benefits Costs\n0103 59.0 50.2 48.4 41.2 (81) 440\n0202 11.7 9.3 8.8 6.7   (9) 26\n0307 60.7 51.2 49.3 41.6 (78) 350\n0601 148.7 124.7 119.8 100.5 (89) 850\n0701 13.7 10.9 10.3 7.7 (11) 23\n1101 19.1 15.8 15.1 12.1 (34) 51\n1401 42.6 35.9 34.6 29.0 (68) 212\n1508 40.9 34.8 33.6 28.5 (72) 252\n1718 109.5 92.0 88.5 74.5 (88) 729\nEIRR = Economic Internal Rate of Return, VOC = vehicle operating costs.\nThe results show that the base case economic internal rate of return covers a wide range. This\nis mainly because of the sensitivity of the analysis to small changes in traffic on low cost, low\ntraffic volume roads. Applying either the 20 percent reduction in benefits or the 20 percent\nincrease in costs shows that improving core roads is still justified.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n98. The  social  dimensions  of  the  Project  (resettlement,  ethnic  minority  development,\nstakeholder  participation,  and  construction  and  maintenance  labor  opportunities)  are  all\ndesigned to facilitate more equitable and sustainable distribution of benefits, particularly for the\npoorest and socially excluded in the project area. The summary social and poverty impact\nassessment of the Project is presented in Supplementary Appendix D.\n99. Direct harm may result from project development, as well as indirect adverse social\nimpacts, including (i) individual and community loss of agricultural land or land associated with\ncommercial  activities  due  to  land  clearance  and  acquisition  issues,  (ii)  potential  for  ethnic\nminority groups not being able to participate in or benefit from the Project to the same extent as\nthe kinh or to suffer disproportionately from adverse cultural effects, and (iii) accidents due to\nlack of road and traffic safety both during and after construction. These potentially adverse\nimpacts will be mitigated by the Project through measures including (i) community participation\nand effective planning and implementation of RPs and EMDPs, and (ii) effective construction\nsupervision and enforcement of contract specifications, as well as implementation of safety\nfeatures.\n100. In addition, the mechanism for promoting participation will have the objective of binding\ntogether the social dimensions of the Project with the technical, environmental, and economic", "28\nfeatures to make this an integrated development project aimed at maximizing development\nimpact and poverty reduction.\n1.  Potential for Community Participation in the Project\n101. Project  preparation  has  taken  a  participatory  approach  that  combined  workshops,\nindividual meetings, key informant interviews, and a field survey of 21 roads, to engender\ncommunity awareness of the Project and to ascertain the degree to which people may benefit or\nbe affected by various subprojects. This participatory approach will continue during preparation,\nimplementation, and monitoring of RPs and EMDPs.\n102. Implementation of the subprojects provides opportunities to include local involvement in\nthe construction and maintenance of the provincial roads. While there could be some reluctance\nto  utilize  local  labor  as  a  component  of  construction,  many  benefits  can  be  derived  from\nencouraging community participation in road development. Firstly, it can engender a high level\nof acceptance and ownership of the subproject. Secondly, it reduces the likelihood of opposition\nto the subproject and the potential for delays. Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, it ensures\nthat the needs of the end-users and potential beneficiaries are adequately incorporated into\nsubproject design; this is particularly important for road projects that are being used as engines\nfor poverty reduction.\n103. The success of any community participation component within the Project will rest upon\nthe  establishment  of  appropriate  communication  networks  and  protocols,  for  which\norganizations such as the Women's Union will provide at least the initial mechanism.\n104. Sufficient and adequate social preparation and mobilization is also paramount if using\nlocal labor is to be successful within the Project and is to contribute to poverty reduction in any\nsubstantial way. This would require some months of awareness building by social mobilizers\nand training in participation in a formal and regular wage-earning system, which is likely to be a\nforeign concept to residents of remote and disadvantaged communities, and particularly ethnic\nminority  communities  that  have  difficulty  participating  in  the  market/wage  economy  due  to\nlanguage and communication skills.\n105. Communities can also participate in identification of needs of minority communities and\ndevelopment; implementation, and monitoring of EMDPs; as well as resettlement planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring of RPs.\n106. Using this type of participatory approach will enhance the poverty reduction potential of\nthe Project. In conjunction with attaining the Project's overriding objectives of rural poverty\nreduction and improvement of access, it will provide ample opportunity to process subprojects\nthat  are  a  part  of  an  integrated  program  of  community-based  and  sustainable  commune\ndevelopment.\nC.  Impact on Poverty\n107. The conclusions of the social and poverty assessment are that the Project will create\nsignificant positive impacts for the communities within the ZOI of each subproject. While some\nmarginal adverse effects could be experienced, predominantly through land clearance and\nacquisition and impacts on ethnic minorities, the effects of these can be adequately mitigated\nprovided the affected communities are given the opportunity for meaningful participation and\nconsultation, for which processes have been established.", "29\n108. Social and poverty reduction benefits can be realized from subprojects implementation\nby providing improved access to basic health and education facilities and other social services\nin the provincial and district centers and also at the commune level in cases where provincial\nroads are the primary access. Improving the access to and between communes will also help\nreduce the remoteness and isolation of ethnic minority groups, a factor that is considered to be\none of the main causes of their severe poverty. Poverty reduction aspects of the Project could\nbe enhanced by engaging affected communities and providing first priority to the poor and\ndisadvantaged in the actual construction of subprojects. The modality for doing this is being\ndeveloped.\n109. The Project will thus achieve its overriding objectives of poverty reduction, improving the\nreliability of access to social and economic opportunities, and reducing the cost associated with\ntransportation on the provincial road network, providing the potential for increasing agricultural\noutput,  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  and  social  and  economic  well-being  of  the  poor,\ndisadvantaged, and ethnic minority sectors of the population.\n110. The Project has the potential to accrue a range of benefits to poor and disadvantaged\ncommunities alike, and if some subprojects can be pursued in tandem with specific poverty\nreduction, rural development, or ethnic minority development programs, the benefits of the\nProject can be enhanced. In general the types of benefits that can be expected to follow from\nsubproject implementation include\n(i)  providing essential transport infrastructure and services and thereby increasing\neconomic growth, as well as access to those services necessary for the social\ndevelopment  of  the  population  increases  the  productive  value  of  limited\nresources of the poor, creates employment opportunities, and provides better\naccess to essential services and markets;\n(ii)  providing for the special needs of the poor that are created through efforts to\nincrease development improves the quality of life of the poor, provides affordable\ntravel, and increases employment opportunities and opportunities for the poor to\nmove into the economic and agricultural mainstream;\n(iii)  sustaining essential transport infrastructure and services for the poor increases\nemployment opportunities for the poor, disadvantaged, and vulnerable groups;\nand equips these groups with new skills and provides additional opportunities for\ncomplementary poverty reduction initiatives; and\n(iv)  enhancing the mobility of women increases their participation in the labor force,\nincreases the economic productivity of women, and improves women's access to\nresources and essential services.\n111. The Project is also in an excellent position to encourage investment in areas that support\nrural development and poverty reduction; in some cases the subprojects could be advanced as\npart of a multisectoral rural development project. The TA (footnote 3) identified the types of\nintegrated programs and complementary activities that could be targeted for investment. If they\ncannot  be  included  within  the  Project,  these  activities  will  be  investigated  during  project\nimplementation for potential inclusion under a grant through aid coordination.", "30\nD.  Risks\n112. The major risks associated with this Project relate to VRA\u2019s progress with institutional\nreform, the quality of works, adherence to time schedules, timeliness of Government approvals\nfor subprojects and construction contracts, availability of sufficient qualified resettlement and\nsocial development specialists to ensure adequate and timely preparation and implementation\nof the RPs and EMDPs, and the timely realization of benefits that would accrue to the rural poor\nand especially to the ethnic minority population. The Government has adopted an action plan for\ninstitutional reform of VRA and its implementation.\n113. For projects of this type the Government has delegated the authority to award contracts\nto the PDOTs with approvals required only by PMU-5 and MOT. This should help speed up the\napproval process. Most of the PDOTs have some experience either with ADB, DFID, JICA, or\nWB financed projects. This will help to ensure timely implementation and understanding of the\nADB procedures. Nevertheless, since PMU-5 has not been involved with ADB-funded projects,\nPMU-5 staff will need to become proficient with ADB requirements. Some PMU-5 staff have\nbeen trained at ADB headquarters in Manila and more training is planned. Consulting services\nfor  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  are  provided  under  the  Project  and  will  be\ncharged with training the PMU-5 and PDOT staff.\n114. People will require time to adjust to a significant improvement of the intermediate goods\nthat affect their lives, such as improved access to opportunities not previously recognized or\nconsidered  available.  To  help  achieve  maximum  benefit,  particularly  to  the  ethnic  minority\npeoples populating much of the hilly and mountainous areas of the project area, the EMDPs\nhave been prepared for the core roads and will be prepared for future subprojects.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n115. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Implementation. The Government will ensure that road construction is carried out\nfollowing good environmental practices including appropriate selection of quarry\nand borrow sites and their subsequent rehabilitation after use;  proper disposal of\nconstruction  wastes  and  materials;  use  of  good  environmental  design  and\nconstruction techniques that ensure slope stability and drainage; minimization of\nconstruction  impacts  such  as  dust,  diversion  of  stream  flow  and  increased\nturbulence, equipment noise, etc.; and other environmental impacts associated\nwith road construction and maintenance.\n(ii)  When project roads pass through or near protected or sensitive areas (nature\nreserves parks, conservation areas, biodiversity reserves, cultural and historical\nsites, etc.), the Government will ensure cooperation between the PDOT and the\narea  authority  responsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  protective\nmeasure.  This  may  include  any  combination  of  area  demarcation,  fencing,\ncheckpoints, speed bumps, wildlife passage zones, patrols, or other measures to\npreserve  the  integrity  of  the  area  from  encroachment  or  environmental\ndegradation due to road improvement and increased access.", "31\n(iii)  Midway  through  project  implementation  (end  2003),  the  Government,  in\ncooperation with ADB, will undertake a detailed review of the Project and its\nimplementation status. The scope of the review will include all aspects of the\nProject, including land acquisition and resettlement. Following completion of the\nreview, the Borrower or Government will take all necessary actions to correct any\nproblems identified in project implementation.\n(iv)  Resettlement. The Government will take all measures necessary to implement to\nthe satisfaction of ADB the RPs developed for project roads, including the EMDP\ncomponents of each RP. The Government will ensure that all people affected by\nthe Project are compensated and resettled in accordance with the requirements\nof the resettlement framework, and RPs, the Government's procedures, and\nADB's involuntary resettlement policy.\n(v)  Ethnic Minorities. The Government will ensure that the EMDPs are designed and\nimplemented  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  the  RPs,  and\nADB's indigenous people policy and in coordination with the Government\u2019s ethnic\nminority program.\n(vi)  Health Risks. The Government will ensure that any civil works contracts for\nworks to be carried out under this Project require the civil works contractors to\nconduct information and education campaigns on sexually transmitted diseases\nand HIV/AIDS for construction workers as part of a health and safety program at\ncampsites during the construction period.\n(vii)  Labor Laws. The Government will set employment targets for women for road\nconstruction activities, as well as require contractors not to differentiate wages\nbetween men and women for work of equal type. Also, child labor will not be\nallowed in the construction activities and camps.\n(viii)  Operation  and  Maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  improved\nroads  are  maintained  to  design  standards  and  in  accordance  with  sound\nmaintenance  practices.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  annual  road\nmaintenance plans are prepared for the improved roads, on the basis of the\nagreed-upon maintenance standards, traffic volumes, and assessment of needs.\n(ix)  Road  Sector  Reform.  The  Government  will  continue  strengthening  the  legal\nframework, regulation, and institutions active in the road subsector, specifically\nVRA, in accordance with the action plan agreed to by ADB. New regulations for\nVRA\u2019s mandate, responsibilities, and functions improving upon the framework for\ninterim regulation of VRA, will be enacted by 31 December 2002.\n(x)  Sector Studies. The Government will keep ADB informed of all transport sector\nand road subsector studies undertaken in Viet Nam; provide ADB with copies of\nall available documents relevant to such studies, including consultants' reports;\nand  ensure that ADB has the opportunity to comment on the recommendations\ncontained therein.\n(xi)  The Government and ADB will from time to time exchange views on progress in\ncarrying  out  the  policies  and  actions  recommended  by  transport  and  road\nstudies. The Government will maintain a policy dialogue with ADB on problems", "32\nand constraints affecting the growth and development of the road subsector, and\nin particular on road maintenance and investment, and road user charges.\n(xii)  Selection of Subprojects. A subproject is eligible for financing under the loan if it:\n(a)  is  economically,  technically,  and  environmentally  feasible  and  has  an\neconomic internal rate of return greater than 12 percent;\n(b)  has received all applicable Governmental clearances; and\n(c)  complies with ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s procedural requirements, and\nresettlement, social, and environment policies and guidelines.\n(xiii)  Project  Performance  Monitoring.  The  Government  will  carry  out  project\nperformance monitoring and evaluation by compiling and analyzing appropriate\ntraffic and socioeconomic data and other data for project roads. Prior to the\ncommencing  of  civil  works,  PMU-5  and  ADB  will  agree  on  the  data  to  be\ncollected and the methodology for their analysis based upon the baseline survey,\nwhich was carried out in 2001.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n116. The Government will have approved RP for each core road, as required, and will have\nprovided the necessary funding and staffing at PMU-5 and the PDOTs.\nC.  Conditions for Award of Contract for Civil Works\n117. ADB will not approve award of any civil works contract for any road to be financed from\nthe loan proceeds unless the Government has completed satisfactorily and in accordance with\nthe approved RP for that road compensation payment  and relocation to new sites, and ensured\nrehabilitation assistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the required land.\nVII.

Introduction\n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded technical assistance (TA) to prepare the\nViet Nam Provincial Road Improvement Project1  (TA) to HELP the Government of Viet Nam\nimplement its road improvement and poverty reduction programs. The project Executing\nAgency is the Project Management Unit-5 (PMU-5) under the Ministry of Transport (MOT)\nlocated in Hanoi. The Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was based on generic outline\ndesigns prior to preliminary engineering and detailed engineering designs of the proposed\nimprovements.  The  TA  efforts  focused  on  screening  and  prioritizing  rehabilitation  and\nmaintenance improvements for provincial roads in the 18 northern provinces based on social,\neconomic, and road condition justification criteria.\n2. The interim report selected core roads from a master list of more than 150 provincial\nroads in the study region. The purpose of the IEE is to screen and document likely adverse\nand beneficial impacts of implementing the rehabilitation works for one of the nine core\nroads, Provincial Road #1101(DT185) in Tuyen Quang Province. Another objective of the\nIEE, consistent with ADB and Vietnamese guidelines, was to identify significant unavoidable\nadverse impacts and determine if further analyses are needed through means of a more\ndetailed environmental impact assessment (EIA). The IEE was in accordance with the ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements and Review Procedures, and Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, as well as with Viet Nam\u2019s environmental\nprocedures. The environmental category of the overall Project is \u201cB.\u201d\nB. Description of the Project\n3. Rehabilitation and maintenance improvements for Road #1101 (DT185) would be\naccomplished for an estimated 58 kilometers (km) of road within the existing road reservation\narea, except for one location where new alignment is needed to bypass a sensitive protected\nhistorical and natural resource site. The road is proposed as a class V road that requires a\nsingle carriageway of 3.5 meters wide with 1.5 meter shoulders, for an embankment width of\n6.5 meters within an existing right-of-way. This varies depending on rural or built-up areas\nthat it crosses and serves. A class V road according to the Vietnamese standard has a\ndesign speed of 20 to 40 km per hour (kph). Traffic operating on this road was recently\nsurveyed at 47 conventional motor vehicles (CMVs) daily.\n4. The road commences at Nong Tien commune (in Tuyen Quang town), traverses an\narea known as Kim Binh, and terminates at Chiem Hoa. It presently has an earth surface 6\nmeters wide. The section of the road connecting Chiem Hoa was improved to a gravel\naggregate surface in 1998. Upgrading is planned during 2001-2002 for two fords on the road.\nThe Provincial Department of Transport (PDOT) proposes paving and/or sealing the road. A\n5 km section is to be treated with asphalt concrete, while the remainder of the road will be\ndouble surface treated. The section of road between km 36 to 46 is in especially poor\ncondition.\n                  \n1  TA 3455-VIE:  Viet Nam Provincial Road Improvement Project, for $ 1.0 million, approved on 14 June 2000.", "53\nAppendix 12, page 2\nC.  Description of the Environment\n5.  The section of existing road improvements goes through four communes in the\nnorthern district of Yen Son, three communes in the northern district of Chiem Hoa, and two\nwithin Tuyen Quang township. In 1999 Yen Son District  had  population of 167,276 and land\narea of 1,208 hectares (ha) Chiem Hoa District had a population of 126,131 and land area of\n1,449 ha; and Tuyen Quang Township  a  population of 218,574 and land area of 43.69 ha.\nAlong the road are several \u201cspecial difficulty communes\u201d identified under Program 185. The\nroad serves a number of ethnic minority populated communes.\n6. The terrain is hilly with a maximum road grade of 14 percent. Pockets of forest and\ncultivated lands are found on both sides of the road. The road is close to the Gam River just\noutside of Tuyen Quang Township and the road crosses several streams. During the rainy\nseason some sections become inundated. Along the immediate road corridor very little\nnatural forest remains and some areas near the road are now being reforested.\n7. Air quality particularly in the first sections of the road coming out of Tuyen Quang\nTownship is heavily influenced by pollution from industrial uses, including a cement factory,\nand from dust-generating traffic associated with industrial activity. The remaining sections of\nthe road have no significant sources of air pollution and air quality is good, however in the\ndry season dust caused by road traffic can be a nuisance. No formally designated waste\ndisposal sites exist within or are adjacent to the road.\n8. The existing road passes through a small part of a valued cultural historical site\nlocated  near  Kim  Binh,  location  of  the  second  Vietnamese  Communist  Party  Congress\nConvention. The Kim Binh Cultural and Historical Site is identified by a large cement placard\nmarker  near  km  46.  The  historical/cultural  site  covers  1,937  ha,  including  900  ha  of\nforestland. No other precious or valuable ecological sites, national parks, nature reserves, or\nsensitive sites have been identified along the road.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Environmental Problems Due to Location and Design\n9. The project road will generally follow the existing alignment that has been in place for\na  very  long  time.  No  significant  impacts  are  expected  since  improvements  such  as\nresurfacing, repair of existing cross and side drainage facilities, and spot rehabilitation of\nexisting facilities all lie within the existing road reservation. Most affected land within road\nreservation  areas  is  either  used  for  agriculture  or  is  nonproductive.  The  principles  of\n\u201cavoidance\u201d and \u201cminimization\u201d regarding mitigation of any adverse impacts of environmental\nconditions has been emphasized during the project identification and preparation phase.\nMitigation of impact on the historical/cultural site at Kim Binh has been proposed in the form\nof a new road bypass alignment and closure of the existing road through the site. The\nproposed new alignment consists of about 600 meters along an existing small secondary\nroad and 600 meters of new road through an abandoned oil palm plantation, which will\nrequire land acquisition and compensation.\n10. Minor road realignment within the road reservation will require clearing of small strips\nof land to rehabilitate drainage or to improve road safety conditions. The road will be lowered\nat any locations in built-up areas to avoid impacts on settlements. Where human settlement", "54\nAppendix 12, page 3\nor productive agricultural land activities have located on road reservation areas, appropriate\ncompensation will be paid if clearing these areas is necessary for the road works. These\nissues are addressed separately in an Initial Social and Poverty Analysis Report and if\nneeded in a separate resettlement and compensation plan.\n2. Environmental Problems Associated with the Construction Stage\n11. The potential for construction activities to have adverse effects on the surrounding\nenvironment is slight. The threat of erosion and silt run off from the road affecting several\nstreams the road crossings is small to moderate. This will be mitigated through standard\noperating  construction  practices  specified  in  contract  documents,  and  road  construction\nworks will be confined entirely within road reservation areas or right-of-way.\n12. The  construction  contract  will  provide  for  revegetation  of  cut  slopes  and\nembankments during construction, and provide for suitable silt traps and other runoff control\nstructures. Quarries and materials will be from existing sites if available. Selection of any new\nsites will be done with the objective of avoiding environmentally sensitive areas, and contract\ndocuments will provide for quarry rehabilitation for sites not having a continuing commercial\nuse.\n13. Contract  documents  will  include  provisions  mandating  appropriate  measures  to\nprotect ambient standards of air quality, water quality, and noise. Dust will be controlled by\nregular spraying of water, noise will be controlled by ensuring that all construction equipment\nis fitted with efficient engine silencers, and work in built-up areas will be restricted to daylight\nhours.\n3. Potential Environmental Enhancement Measures and Additional\nConsiderations\n14. The long-term net beneficial effects will offset any temporary unavoidable adverse\nimpacts due to construction. In the case of the Kim Binh Cultural and Historical Site, special\nenvironmental enhancement mitigation actions may be implemented to prevent unwarranted\nencroachment. These will be determined by the PDOT in coordination with the provincial\nauthorities responsible for the site and may include demarcation of the site boundaries,\nfencing and/or checkpoints.\nE. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n15. The implementing agency, PMU-5, and the Tuyen Quang PDOT will be responsible\nfor environmental management and monitoring for this subproject, including supervision of\nimplementation of mitigation measures and promotion of appropriate construction methods.\nPMU-5 and the Tuyen Quang PDOT will appoint staff to the environment and social units\n(ESUs) within their respective organizations. They will participate in project identification and\npreparation,  including  environmental  assessment  (IEE  and  if  necessary  EIA),  and\ndevelopment of an environmental management and monitoring program for this and other\nproject roads. PMU-5 and the Tuyen Quang PDOT, assisted by project consultants, will\nensure that they fully comply with the social and environmental recommendations in project\ncontract documents.", "55\nAppendix 12, page 4\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n16. The one set of potential environmental impacts relate to the Kim Binh Cultural and\nHistorical Site. Implementation of the proposed bypass alignment of the road and closure of\nthe old road through the site, and enhancement mitigation measures put in place where the\nnew  alignment  passes  near  the  site,  should  effectively  negate  any  negative  impacts.\nElsewhere only slight environmental impacts are expected due to construction and minor\nroad realignment but they should be temporary and minimal if good standard environmental\nconstruction practices are maintained.\nG. Conclusion\n17. Aside from the road realignment and construction near the Kim Binh Cultural and\nHistorical Site, the subproject will not have significant adverse impacts on the surrounding\nenvironment  and  should  be  outweighed  by  the  socioeconomic  and  poverty  reduction\nbenefits. Environmental management plans will mitigate or minimize minor or temporary\nconstruction impacts. Where needed, land compensation and resettlement action plans will\nbe coordinated by PMU-5 and the Tuyen Quang PDOT. In accordance with ADB regulations\na full EIA should not be required.\n18. The Government law has two stages of environmental assessment: (i) a preliminary\nenvironmental assessment (similar, but not fully equal, to ADB\u2019s IEE), and (ii) an EIA. An EIA\nis  required  when  a  significant  environmental  impact  has  been  identified  during  the\npreliminary environmental assessment. An EIA also is mandated for all major projects, which\nin the case of roads are those more than 50 km in length, and when a project road is located\nnear protected parks, environmentally sensitive sites, tourist sites, and international and\nnational  cultural  and  historical  sites  (Circular  Letter  of  Guidance  on  Setting  Up  and\nAppraising  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  Report  for  Investment  Projects,\nCircular No. 490/1998/TT-BKHCNMT).\n19. As per the circular letter, this subproject will require submission of an Application for a\nRegistration for Securing Environmental Standards from the minister of science, technology\nand  environment  (MOSTE)  or  the  chairman  of  the  Provincial  People\u2019s  Committee.\nAccompanying the application must be a copy of the preliminary environment assessment, in\nVietnamese. Since this subproject is both longer than 50 km and passes near a cultural and\nhistorical  site,  a  decision  will  be  required  from  MOSTE  and/or  the  Provincial  People\u2019s\nCommittee as to whether an EIA will be necessary.", "56\nAppendix 13, page 1\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK\nA. Introduction\n1. Applicability of the Different Components of the Framework\n1. The resettlement framework consists of two components. The first deals with\nland acquisition and resettlement of people affected by the Project. The provisions of the\nland acquisition and resettlement component will be applicable in all cases where land\nacquisition  and/or  resettlement  is  required  as  part  of  project  implementation.  The\nprovisions of the second, the ethnic minority development component, will be applicable\nin all cases where there are three minority people living in the zone of influence (ZOI)1 of\na subproject road.\nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Component\n2. Resettlement Principles\n(cid:1)(cid:2)\nThe project\u2019s policy framework and entitlements have built upon the laws of the\nGovernment,  principally  the  1993  Land  Law,  Decree  22/CP  (1998),  Decree  87/CP\n(1994), and the policy on involuntary resettlement (1995) of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB). With the promulgation of Decree 22/CP (24 April 1998), the Government\nhas issued legislation regarding resettlement, which approaches the principles of ADB's\npolicy. However, provisions and principles adopted in the framework for the Project\nsupercede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a\ngap exists. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project:\n(i) The principal objective of ADB's policy and the resettlement plan (RP) is\nto ensure that populations affected by the Project should be at least as\nwell off, if not better off than they would have been without the Project.\nAffected populations should be able to maintain and preferably improve\ntheir standard of living and quality of life.\n(ii)  The populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may\nstand to lose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and\nnonphysical  assets,  including  homes,  homesteads,  productive  lands,\ncommercial properties, tenancy, income-earning opportunities, social and\ncultural  activities  and  relationships,  and  other  losses  that  may  be\nidentified during the process of resettlement planning.\n(iii)  Involuntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by  identifying  possible\nalternative project designs, and appropriate social, economic, operational,\nand engineering solutions that have the least impact on populations in the\nproject area.\n(iv)  A census/inventory of assets and socioeconomic survey were carried out\nfor core roads will also be carried out for all subproject roads prior to\npreparation of resettlement plans (RPs) for each. The findings for each\n                                                          \n1    Zone of influence is defined as all communes through which a subproject road passes, and any other\n     commune located within close proximity of a subproject road..", "57\nAppendix 13, page 2\nwill  represent  the  cutoff  date  for  compensation  eligibility  for  physical\nassets as these are identified.\n(v)  All people affected will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets,\nincomes,  and  businesses  at  replacement  cost;  and  provided  with\nrehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least\nrestore their preproject living standards, income levels, and productive\ncapacity.\n(vi)  All  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and\nrehabilitation assistance, irrespective of tenure status, social or economic\nstanding, and any such factors that may discriminate against achieving\nthe objectives outlined above.\n(vii)  In the case of population relocation, efforts will be made for the existing\nsocial and cultural institutions of the people being resettled and host\ncommunity to be maintained to the extent possible.\n(viii)  Preparation  of  RPs  (as  part  of  subproject  preparation)  and  their\nimplementation  are  to  be  carried  out  with  the  participation  and\nconsultation of affected people.\n(ix)  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made\navailable to cover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement within the\nagreed implementation period.\n(x)  Construction activities will not commence until the required lands have\nbeen fully acquired, and the affected people appropriately compensated\nand assisted in accordance with the approved framework and RPs.\n(xi)  Detailed  RPs  for  implementation  will  be  translated  into  the  local\nlanguages and placed in project and commune offices for the reference\nby the affected people, as well as any interested groups.\n(xii)  Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be\nidentified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement  management\nsystem. Evaluation of the land acquisition process and the final outcome\nwill be conducted independently of the Executing Agency.\n2. Project  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  and  Entitlement\nMatrix\n3. The project resettlement and rehabilitation policy and entitlements are designed\nto cover compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets; and restore or\nenhance the livelihoods of all categories (directly and indirectly affected, title holders and\nnontitle  holders)  of  affected  people.  The  people  affected  will  not  only  receive\nreplacement land or cash for land and other assets at replacement cost, but many\nadditional measures will be taken such as special assistance to vulnerable groups. A\nsummary entitlement matrix for the Project (Table A13) summarizes the main types of\nlosses and the support entitled for each type of loss.", "58\nAppendix 13, page 3\nTable A13.

Ethnic Minority and Disadvantaged People Development Component\n1. Ethnic Minority Development Policy, Objectives, and Basic \nPrinciples\n4. The ethnic minority development component will be prepared and with ADB\u2019s\npolicy  on  indigenous  people  and  Operations  Manual  &  Guidelines  on  Operational\nProcedures: Section 53 Indigenous Peoples (January 2001). Ethnic minorities in Viet\nNam are recognized as vulnerable groups by the Government and given special policy\nconsiderations;  development  interventions  have  been  targeted  them.  In  1994,  the\nCommittee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas (CEMMA) was created and\nassigned a role of monitoring and coordinating ethnic minority development activities.\nThe Government has in place a number of programs aimed at integrating ethnic minority\ngroups  into  overall  Vietnamese  society  and  in  particular  increasing  their  greater\nparticipation in mainstream economic life. The Government is seeking to address the\ninequities  of  both  development  and  infrastructure  provision  in  the  remote  and\nmountainous areas with Program 135. Specific objectives of the program are to reduce\nthe number of poor households, provide basic infrastructure (sufficient water supply and\n\"motorable\" roads) and encourage social and economic development (attain 70 percent\nof school age children enrolled and attending school, and encourage development of\nrural markets). The Project will support and coordinate with Program 135 by developing\nand implementing of subproject ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs).\n5. The overall objectives of EMDPs are to ensure that the Project provides the\nopportunity for ethnic minority groups to reap project benefits that are equal to, or\ngreater than, the dominant cultural group.\n6. The main features of the EMDP process will be a preliminary screening process,\na social assessment to determine the degree and nature of impact of improving the road,\na strategic action plan, and project monitoring. Consultations with, and participation of,\nthe minority groups, their leaders, and local government officials in the design and\nimplementation of subproject EMDPs will be an integral part of the overall ethnic minority\ndevelopment component. Coordination with existing Government programs for ethnic\nminorities will be essential.\n7. The ethnic minority development component will consist of a number of activities\nincluding mitigation measures for any potentially negative impacts identified in the social\nassessment, any requirements for modifying subproject design, and outline of supporting\nor development assistance. Where land clearance and acquisition is required that will\naffect ethnic minority communities, the Project will ensure that their rights will not be\nviolated and that they are appropriately and adequately compensated for the clearance,\ntaking, or use of any part of their land, provided that the clearance, taking, or use is\nundertaken in a manner that is culturally acceptable to them. The compensation will\nfollow the process established in this resettlement framework.\n2.  Development Activities\u2013Rural Development Support\n8. In general, development benefits to be provided to ethnic minority groups will\ninclude the following:", "60\nAppendix 13, page 5\n9. Community  Infrastructure  Fund.  This  fund  will  be  given  to  communes  to\nimprove (i) physical access such as trails and footbridges that will be designed and\nconstructed through village consultation and participation in response to community\nneeds; and (ii) community infrastructure and services such as installation of tube wells\nand  repairing  of  existing  defunct  ones;  construction  of  community  markets,\nkindergartens,  or  other  community  facilities  required  in  any  specific  location;  and\nconstruction of village fishponds and renovation of existing fishponds. The communes\nwill be assisted by Project Management Unit (PMU-5) and provincial departments of\ntransport (PDOTs) to develop proposals to people's committees for approval. Qualified\nlocal contractors will be engaged by the PDOTs. These contractors will be encouraged\nby the PDOTs to give preferential access to communes to road construction employment\nopportunities to the extent possible.\n10. Participatory  Agricultural  Extension  Services.  Agricultural  extension\nassistance will be provided to farmers for crop intensification and diversification and\nfarmer-to-farmer training. PMU-5 will coordinate with CEMMA, Ministry of Agriculture\nand Rural Development, and mass organizations to provide participatory agricultural\nextension services based on a participatory agricultural extension services program\nbeing implemented by SNV Netherlands Development Organization through Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Development.\n11. Support Services for Credit Utilization. The Project will facilitate information\ndissemination on available credit and training on how to utilize credit services. The\nproject  consultants  will  facilitate  training  of  the  Women\u2019s  Union  and/or  Farmers\u2019\nAssociation on how to provide these support services to the communes.\n3.  Budget\n12. The cost estimate for all EMDPs for the Project amounts to $1.5 million. This  will\ncover EMDPs for the yet-to-be selected road sections where there are ethnic minorities\nliving  within  their  ZOI.  The  amount  to  be  allocated  for  each  road  section  will  be\ndetermined through a participatory process according to the needs and socioeconomic\nconditions of the communities with the ZOI of each road. Adequate budgetary support\nwill be fully committed and made available to cover the costs of the EMDPs within the\nagreed implementation period.\n4.  Implementation Schedule\n 13. RP implementation will commence after the project supervision consultants are\nmobilized.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  and  assist  the  PDOTs  on  all\nresettlement activities. Civil works contracts for each road will only be awarded after all\ncompensation  and  relocation  has  been  satisfactorily  completed  for  each  road  and\nrehabilitation measures are in place.\n14.

Introduction\n 1. The Sa Pa-Ban Den 14 kilometers (km) road is a single carriageway of 3.5\nmeters (m) width with an embankment width of 6.1 m within an existing right-of-way.\nThe road traverses six communes, and all communes will be affected by land acquisition\nto widen the embankment to 6.5 m width.\n \n2. This document is a summary of the resettlement plan (RP), which has been\nprepared for this subproject. This RP consists of two components: the first provides for\nland acquisition and resettlement of people affected by the Project, the second  is the\nethnic minority development plan (EMDP) required because of the large ethnic minority\npopulation within the zone of influence (ZOI)1 of the subproject road.\nB.  Land Acquisition And Resettlement Component\n1.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n3. Based on the initial results of the census and inventory of losses of all potential\npeople affected, and socioeconomic survey of 20 percent of all those affected, a total of\n200 households will be affected by land acquisition. The entire population within the ZOI\nof the subproject consists of the Hmong ethnic group, which is a minority ethnic group\nwithin Viet Nam. The road is located within a rural mountainous setting. An estimated\n10.6 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, affecting 6.9 ha of crops and 420 trees.\nApproximately 27 households will be severely affected by loss of agricultural land and\nhouses,  and  will  relocate  their  houses,  businesses,  and  other  structures;  17  other\nstructures (kitchens, toilets, buffalo stables, walls) will also have to be dismantled and\nrebuilt. The consultations confirm that the potentially affected households are willing to\nmove back and rebuild their houses on their remaining land beyond the right-of-way. If\nany households do not have remaining land to rebuild their houses, they will be assisted\nby the Project to look for replacement land at a location satisfactory to them.\n2.  Resettlement Principles\n(cid:1)(cid:2)\nThe policy framework and entitlements for the Project have built upon the laws of\nthe Government, principally the 1993 Land Law, Decree 22/CP (1998), Decree 87/CP\n(1994), and the policy on involuntary resettlement (1995) of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB). With the promulgation of Decree 22/CP (24 April 1998), the Government\nissued legislation regarding resettlement, which approaches the principles of ADB's\npolicy. However, provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement framework for the\nProject supercede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam\nwherever a gap exists. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project:\n(i)  The principal objective of ADB's policy and the resettlement plan (RP) is\nto ensure that populations affected by the Project should be at least as\nwell off, if not better off than they would have been without the Project.\n                                                          \n1   The ZOI is defined as all communes through which the project road passes, and any other\n     commune located within close proximity of the project road.", "62\nAppendix 14, page 2\nAffected populations should be able to maintain and preferably improve\ntheir standard of living and quality of life.\n(ii)  The populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may\nstand to lose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and\nnonphysical  assets,  including  homes,  homesteads,  productive  lands,\ncommercial properties, tenancy, income-earning opportunities, social and\ncultural  activities  and  relationships,  and  other  losses  that  may  be\nidentified during the process of resettlement planning.\n(iii)  Involuntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by  identifying  possible\nalternative project designs, and appropriate social, economic, operational,\nand engineering solutions that have the least impact on populations in the\nproject area.\n(iv)  The findings for each will represent the cutoff date for compensation\neligibility for physical assets as these are identified.\n(v)  All people affected will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets,\nincomes,  and  businesses  at  replacement  cost,  and  provided  with\nrehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least\nrestore their preproject living standards, income levels, and productive\ncapacity.\n(vi)  All  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and\nrehabilitation assistance, irrespective of tenure status, social or economic\nstanding, and any such factors that may discriminate against achieving\nthe objectives outlined above.\n(vii)  In the case of population relocation, efforts will be made for the existing\nsocial and cultural institutions of the people being resettled and host\ncommunity to be maintained to the extent possible.\n(viii)  Preparation and implementation of the RP is to be carried out with the\nparticipation and consultation of affected people.\n(ix)  Adequate budgetary support for an estimated D1,479,606 ($0.099 million)\nwill be fully committed and be made available to cover the costs of land\nacquisition and resettlement within the agreed implementation period.\n(x)  Construction activities will not commence until the required lands have\nbeen fully acquired and those affected are appropriately compensated\nand assisted in accordance with the approved framework and RP.\n(xi)  The detailed RP will be translated into the local languages and placed in\nproject and commune offices for the reference of those affected, as well\nas any interested groups.\n(xii)  Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be\nidentified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement  management", "63\nAppendix 14, page 3\nsystem. Evaluation of the land acquisition process and the final outcome\nwill be conducted independent of the Executing Agency.\n3. Project  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  and  Entitlement\nMatrix\n5. The  project    resettlement  and  rehabilitation  policy  and  entitlements  were\ndesigned to cover compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets and\nrestore or enhance the livelihoods of all categories (directly and indirectly affected, title\nholders and nontitle holders) of affected people. Those affected will not only receive\nreplacement land or cash for land and other assets at replacement cost, but many\nadditional measures will be taken such as special assistance to vulnerable groups. A\nsummary entitlement matrix for the Project ( Appendix 13) summarizes the main types of\nlosses and the support entitled for each type of loss.\nC.  Ethnic Minority and other Disadvantaged People Development Plan\nComponent\n1. Ethnic Minorities in the Project Area\n6. All 200 households directly affected by land acquisition for this road, as well as\nothers within the ZOI of the road is comprised of the Hmong ethnic group, who are the\nmajority population in this area.\n2. Ethnic Minority Development Policy, Objectives, and Basic \nPrinciples\n7. The ethnic minority development component will be prepared in accordance with\nADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people and Policy and Operations Manual & Guidelines on\nOperational  Procedures:  Section  53  Indigenous  Peoples  (January  2001).  Ethnic\nminorities in Viet Nam are recognized as vulnerable groups by the Government and are\ngiven  special  policy  considerations;  development  interventions  have  been  targeted\ntoward them. In 1994 the Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas was\ncreated and assigned a role of monitoring and coordinating ethnic minority development\nactivities.  The  Government  has  a  number  of  programs  aimed  at  integrating  ethnic\nminority  groups  into  overall  Vietnamese  society  and  in  particular  increasing  their\nparticipation in mainstream economic life. Through this EMDP, the Project will assist the\nGovernment to address the inequities of both development and infrastructure provision\nin the remote and mountainous project area. The Project will support and coordinate with\nProgram 135  by developing and implementing the EMDP.\n8. The  overall  objectives  of  the  EMDP  is  to  ensure  that  the  Project  provides\nopportunities for ethnic minority groups to reap project benefits that are equal to, or\ngreater than, the dominant cultural group.\n9. The main features of the EMDP process will be a preliminary screening process,\na social assessment  to determine the degree and nature of impact of improving the\nroad,  a  strategic  action  plan,  and  project  monitoring.  Consultations  with,  and\nparticipation of, the minority groups, their leaders, and local government officials in the\ndesign  and  implementation  of  the  EMDP  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  EMDP\nCoordination with existing Government programs for ethnic minorities will be essential.", "64\nAppendix 14, page 4\n10. The EMDP will consist of a number of items and activities including mitigation\nmeasures for any potentially negative impacts identified in the social assessment, any\nrequirements  for  modification  of  subproject  design,  and  outline  of  supporting  or\ndevelopment assistance. Where land clearance and acquisition is required that will affect\nethnic minority communities, the Project will ensure that their rights will not be violated\nand that they are appropriately and adequately compensated for the clearance, taking,\nor use of any part of their land, provided that the clearance, taking, or use is undertaken\nin a manner that is culturally acceptable to them. The compensation will follow the\nprocess established in this resettlement framework.\n3.  Development Activities\u2013Rural Development Support\n11. In general, development benefits to be provided to ethnic minority groups shall\ninclude the following.\n12. Community Infrastructure Fund.   This fund will be given to communes to\nimprove (i) physical access such as trails and footbridges that will be designed and\nconstructed through village consultation and participation in response to community\nneeds, and (ii) community infrastructure and services such as installation of tube wells\nand  repairing  of  existing  defunct  ones;  construction  of  community  markets,\nkindergartens, or other community facilities required in any specific location; construction\nof  village  fishponds;  and  renovation  of  existing  fishponds.  The  communes  will  be\nassisted by Project Management Unit-5 (PMU-5) and provincial departments of transport\n(PDOTs) to develop proposals to People's Committees for approval. Qualified local\ncontractors will be engaged by the PDOTs.  These contractors will be encouraged by the\nPDOTs  to  give  preferential  access  to  communes  to  road  construction  employment\nopportunities to the extent possible.\n13. Participatory  Agricultural  Extension  Services.    Agricultural  extension\nassistance will be provided to farmers for crop intensification and diversification and\nfarmer-to-farmer training.  PMU-5 will coordinate with CEMMA, Ministry of Agriculture\nand  Rural  Development  (MARD),  and  mass  organizations  to  provide  participatory\nagricultural extension services based on a participatory agricultural extension services\nprogram being implemented by SNV through MARD.\n14. Support Services for Credit Utilization.  The Project will facilitate information\ndissemination on available credit and training on how to utilize credit services.  The\nProject  consultants  will  facilitate  training  of  the  Women\u2019s  Union  and/or  Farmers\u2019\nAssociation on how to provide these support services to the communes.\n4. Budget\n15. The cost estimate for all EMDPs for the Project amounts to $1.5 million. It has\nbeen estimated that approximately $20,000 per road section plus administrative costs\nand monitoring will be allocated to each subproject road. The actual amount to be\nallocated for each subproject road , including this one, will be determined through a\nparticipatory  process  according  to  the  needs  and  socio-economic  conditions  of  the\ncommunities  with  the  ZOI  of  each  road.  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully\ncommitted  and  made  available  to  cover  the  costs  of  EMDPs  within  the  agreed\nimplementation period.", "65\nAppendix 14, page 5\n5. Implementation Schedule\n 16. RP implementation will commence after the project supervision consultants are\nmobilized.    The  Consultants  will  work  closely  with  and  assist  the  PDOTs  on  all\nresettlement activities. Civil works contracts for each road will only be awarded after all\ncompensation  and  relocation  has  been  satisfactorily  completed  for  each  road  and\nrehabilitation measures are in place.\n17. Detailed design of the ethnic minority development component can only take\nplace  during  Project  implementation  because  it  requires  appropriately  qualified\ninternational and domestic consultants working side by side with and training PMU-5 and\nPDOTs and other members of the Project Team, as well as the active participation of the\nHmong communities. The ethnic minority development component will be implemented\nduring and after the land acquisition and resettlement process.", "66\nAppendix 15, page 1\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\nA. Introduction\n1. The Project is based on the need to fill the gap left by the improvement of national roads\nand district and commune roads in the project area. Improvement of the provincial road network\nwill help bring the provincial facilities and related economic opportunities closer to the rural poor\npopulation. The total length of the provincial road network in the 18 provinces in the project area\nis  about  8,100  kilometers  (km)  serving  a  total  population  of  about  19  million.  Poverty\ncharacterizes the project area especially in the rural areas with poverty incidence generally\nincreasing  with  distance  from  the  economic  centers  of  Hanoi  and  Haiphong.  Given  the\nresources and population density, economic and social development has significant potential.\nThe Project thus identifies the provincial road network and based on a sample of these roads\nidentifies and prioritizes about 2,800 km justified for improvement on both economic and social\ngrounds. These 2,800 km were further screened to yield about 1,600 km considered to have the\nhighest development and economic priority. Nine core roads have been fully prepared for\nimplementation following loan effectiveness.\nB. The Project and Project Area\n1. The Project\n2. The part of the Project subject to this economic evaluation is the proposed improvement\nof the provincial roads. The funds provided under the loan will be adequate for improving about\n1,600 km, although the total length to be improved will depend on the actual cost of the\nimprovements accumulated until all available funds are committed. Improvement will generally\ncomprise upgrading to a class V road characterized by a 6.5 meters (m) formation width and a\n3.5 m pavement width. Pavements will be sealed to an all-weather standard on the existing\nalignment. Variations to these dimensions and class of improvement will be allowed where\njustified on economic, technical, or social grounds.\n2. The Project Area\n3. The Project covers a geographic area of some 116,313 km2 and includes 18 northern\nand contiguous provinces, of which 6 provinces share a border with the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina and 3 share a border with Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Eight provinces in the\nnorthern part of the country are excluded as their economies and road networks are relatively\nmore developed/industrialized. These are Bac Ninh, Hai Duong, Haiphong, Hanoi, Hung Yen,\nNam Dinh, Ninh Binh, and Thai Binh. The 18 provinces included in the project area can be\nfurther subdivided into 193 districts and 3,520 communes. The core roads pass through 53\ncommunes including 14 specially disadvantaged communes. The population of the project area\nis  some  18.8  million,  nearly  one  quarter  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  population.  The  provinces  are\npredominantly rural, and while population densities vary considerably across the 18 provinces,\nthe average population density is low at 162 people per km2. indicating the limited amount of\nusable space in mountainous areas that tend to predominate the Project area. The project\nprovinces are very poor with a largely agricultural economic base. In 1998, gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) per capita ranged from D4.2 million in Quang Ninh to D1.2 million in Lai Chau. If\nQuang Ninh, which includes the relatively well-off Ha Long area from the range along with Lai\nChau Province, per capita income varies from D2.5 million to 1.5 million. Countrywide the GDP\nper capita in 1998 was D3.25 million, some 60 percent greater than the typical project province.", "Appendix 15, page 2\n67\nC. Project Roads\n4. The  8,100  km  provincial  roads  in  the  project  area  represent  the  connecting  links\nbetween the commune and district roads and the national highway network. As such their\nimprovement  is  essential  for  the  rural  population,  which  mostly  have  direct  access  to  the\ncommune and district roads to fully benefit from access to a much broader spectrum of social\nand economic opportunities than they presently have. The project roads have been chosen for\ntheir priority in general and in terms of their provincial priority. Almost all project roads are in\nvery poor condition, stone or earth surfaced, with travel speeds of 5 to 15 km per hour for\nmotorized traffic when passable.\n1. Road Selection\n5. Initially an inventory of all provincial roads was gathered and totaled about 8,100 km.\nFrom this the provincial authorities supplied a list of their highest priority roads excluding those\nthat had recently been or would soon be improved, were still in reasonable condition, and had\nvery low priority. From this, a list of about 2,800 km was identified. Funding available under the\nProject indicated that a maximum of about 1,600 km of the highest priority roads in about 154\nlinks could be improved. This is a very large number for complete preparation under a feasibility\nstudy. To overcome this a set of core Roads representative of the roads in the project area were\nselected for detailed evaluation and preparation of a method of evaluation that could be applied\nto all other candidate roads. The main characteristics of the nine core roads representing about\n10 percent of the project roads are shown in Table A15.1.\nTable A15.1: Core Roads\nImprove-\nRoad Road Location Province Length ment Terrain Traffic\nNumber Code (km) Class CMV\n0103 TL 107 Thuan Chau Son La 29.0 V Mountai 68\nnous\n0202 TL 132 Phong Tho Lai Chau 27.0 V Mountai 32\nnous\n0307 LC- Sa Pa \u2013 Ban Lao Cai 14.0 V Mountai 232\nSP:07 Den nous\n0601 TL 253 Doc Lim \u2013 Ho Thai 6.8 V Flat 324\nNuc Coc Nguyen\n0701 TL 312 Chan Mong \u2013 Phu To 10.0 IV Flat 22\nThanh Ba\n1101 TL 185 TQ \u2013 Kim Binh Tuyen 58.0 V Hilly 47\nQuang\n1401 TL 434 Hoa Binh \u2013 Hoa Binh 11.0 V Hilly 225\nYen Mong\n1508 TL 90 Quang Oai \u2013 Ha Tay 6.0 V Flat 60\nDong Lau\n1718 TL TY Tho Xuab \u2013 Thanh 11.4 V Flat 248\nYen Dinh Hoa\nNine core roads 178.2\nCMV = conventional motor vehicles excluding motorcycles and small motor powered farm tractors.\nNote:   Socioeconomic rank is based on poverty, access to social facilities, markets, rice production, and\n               population\n               density.\nSource:  Provincial Department of Transport.", "68\nAppendix 15, page 3\n2. Road Condition and Traffic\n6. Road condition is expressed using a road condition index  that is based on roughness as\nmeasured by the international roughness index (IRI). IRI varies but most roads have an IRI of 9\nm per km to 12 m per km.\n7. For the core roads, traffic is based on actual counts carried out by the consultant and the\nProvincial Department of Transport (PDOTs). Traffic categories included cars, pickup trucks,\nsmall buses (about 15 to 20 passengers), buses, small trucks, trucks, motorcycles, and cong\nnongs. Motorcycles are very common in Viet Nam and are becoming more common in rural\nareas as the roads are improved and with the recent introduction of affordable motorcycles\nmanufactured  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Cong  nongs  are  small  tractors\nconverted for road use by attaching a trailer. They are used for transporting both passengers\nand cargo. Bicycles, bullock carts, and pedestrians were also counted. Motorized traffic on the\ncore roads ranged from 23 to 324 vehicles per day (vpd), while motorcycles ranged from 64 to\n1,485 per day. Nonmotorized traffic ranged from 56 to 5,847.\n3. Traffic Forecasts\n8. Information concerning traffic on the road network including the provincial road network\nis sparse and no adequate basis is provided by historical data on which to forecast traffic flows,\neven in the short term. As done in all major transport projects prepared over the last five years\nin Viet Nam, real per capita GDP growth rates are used as the basis for forecasting traffic\ngrowth, factored as appropriate by assumptions on transport demand elasticity ratios and other\nfactors.\n9. Most recently derived elasticity values for application nationwide were 1.2 for cars,\nbuses, small buses, and 4x4 passenger vehicles; 2.0 for motorcycles; and an elasticity of 1.0 for\nall other movements. These estimates appeared to be a reasonable basis but the need to be\nadjusted to reflect regional economic differences. The motorcycle population in the project area,\nparticularly in the more affluent Delta region, is growing rapidly. Therefore an elasticity factor of\n2.5 is used during the early years of the forecast period up to 2005. For the Delta region, which\nis experiencing and is expected to continue to experience rapid growth, a 2-percentage point\ndifference until 2010 is added. With a forecast annual GDP growth rate of at least 5 percent per\nyear expected, the forecast growth rates for traffic used in the economic analysis are as shown\nin Table A15.2.\nTable A15.2: Annual Traffic Growth Rates\nPassenger Cargo\nArea Motorcycle (motorized) (motorized) Other\nProject Area 13a 6 5 5\n(excl.

All costs have been adjusted to reflect shadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor,\nand standard conversation factors for nontraded goods such as margins and overheads. The\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.93  was  calculated  by  means  of  domestic  to  border  price\nconversion. The shadow wage rates for rural and skilled labor were calculated at 0.57 and 0.97\nrespectively. Specific costs were built up from basic data and adjusted for economic costs.\nConstruction costs include costs for supervision, physical contingency, and resettlement.\n1. User Costs\n11. Vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings are the main benefits quantified in the economic\nevaluation. VOCs were calculated without and with the road improvements, and were estimated\nfor seven typical vehicle types using the HDM-4 model. This takes into account project\u2013induced\nchanges in surface conditions, gradient and vehicle speeds, as well as a number of other\nfactors such as the VOC components (vehicle, fuel, oil, tires, maintenance, interest, overhead,\ncrew and passenger time, and insurance costs). As roughness is the main factor affecting VOCs\non the provincial roads, the VOCs for the motor vehicles according to road roughness is shown\nin Table A15.3. For example by reducing the roughness from 12 IRI to 4 IRI, as would be the\ncase for many of the Project roads, VOCs decline by more than 40 percent to more than 50\npercent. If initial roughness is higher, then the savings are also commensurately greater. VOC\nsavings for the representative vehicles for the existing road and the improved core roads are set\nout in Table A15.4. On a particular road stretch, roughness is considered the main influence on\nVOC. The project roads are in very poor condition with an IRI ranging from about 6 m per km to\n20 m per km and above. After improvement, the IRI will reduce to about 4 m per km. As the\nimprovements are to be low cost and simple, the existing alignment will not change either\nvertically  or  horizontally.  Speeds  after  improvement  will  depend  on  the  alignment.  Before\nimprovement, speeds are typically 5 to 15 km per hour mainly because of surface condition.\nAfter  improvement,  they  are  expected  to  increase  substantially  to  20  to  60  km  per  hour\ndepending largely on terrain.\nTable A15.3: VOCs for Typical Motor Vehicles\nAccording to Road Roughness\n(VOCs in $ per km)\nMotor Small Small Medium Large Cong\nIRI cycle Car Bus Bus Truck Truck Truck Nong\n4.00 0.0385 0.1200 0.1604 0.2252 0.1575 0.1375 0.1588 0.0447\n6.00 0.0432 0.1600 0.2030 0.2900 0.1890 0.1690 0.1890 0.0515\n9.00 0.0552 0.2200 0.2669 0.3872 0.2363 0.2163 0.2344 0.0625\n12.00 0.0756 0.2800 0.3309 0.4843 0.2835 0.2636 0.2797 0.0746\n15.00 0.0877 0.3400 0.3948 0.5815 0.3308 0.3110 0.3251 0.0887\n18.00 0.1118 0.4000 0.4588 0.6786 0.3780 0.3583 0.3704 0.1054\nIRI = international roughness index.\nSource: Consultants.", "70\nAppendix 15, page 5\nTable A15.4: Core Road VOC Savings and Traffic Volumes for Typical Vehicles\n($000 and vpd in 2003)\nSmall Small Motor- Cong\nRoad     Car Pickup Bus Bus Truck Truck Cycle Nong Total\nNumber Km Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol. Sav/Vol.\n0103 29.0   6   2   8   3 46 12 10   2 41  29   9   7  561 1,049   7 17 688 1,121\n0202 27.0   8   5 10   8 15   9    3   1  3    2   1   1    31      76   2   7 104     109\n0307 14.0   1   1   1   1 73 84 30 23 63 100 15 25    67    328 10 70 260     632\n0601 6.8   9 21 12 38   7 16 45 66 47 146 11 37 157 1,485   7 97 296 1,906\n0701 8.5   3   5   0   1   6  10   2   2   6   14 14 35     8     64   1   7   39     138\n1101 58.0   2   1   2   1   2     1   7   2 52   33 14   9 137   271   5 14 220     332\n1401 11.0   5 14   8 25   1     2   5   8 42 141 10 35   49  540   4 68 124     833\n1508 6.0   3 12   4 22   0     1   1   2   3  19   1   5   53  927   1 18   66 1,006\n1718 11.4 18 28 25 50 68 100 66 64   2    5   0   1 117  742   8 75 304 1,065\nSav/Vol = savings per volume, VOC = vehicle operating cost\n12. Road closure or impassability is normally not a necessary consideration in evaluating\nimprovements to major highways as this would usually be measured in terms of a few hours a\nday and not days or months, and the resulting benefits would be small and normally not affect\nthe investment decision.1 In their current condition, many of the project roads become saturated\nduring the rainy season when what remains of the road surface is so badly rutted and slippery\nthat two-wheel-drive motor vehicles cannot negotiate them. To put a value on such disturbances\nis difficult but can be approximated. This was done by transferring travelers and cargo to more\nexpensive 4-or-more-wheel-drive vehicles for essential social or economic purposes. A factor to\nbe applied to VOCs of non-4-wheel drive vehicles was developed to represent costs of using 4-\nwheel drive over the closure period. This factor ranged from 1.02 for 5 days closure to 1.78 for\n90 days closure, and represent a range of closure from 10 percent to 70 percent of the road link\nlength, respectively. This reflects that it is very unusual for the entire length of road to become\nimpassable.\n2. Construction and Other Costs\n13. Construction and maintenance costs were also estimated for the project roads. Two\nclasses of road improvement were considered. Class V will be the most widely specified and\ninvolves a formation width of 6.5 m and a carriageway width of 3.5 m with 1.5 m wide shoulders\non each side. The riding surface may be either gravel or double bituminous surface treatment\n(DBST) with gravel or hard shoulders where large numbers of two-wheeled or nonmotorized are\nidentified. For more heavily trafficked roads, class IV may be considered. Class IV features a\n9.0 m formation width with a 6 m carriageway and 1.5 m shoulders on each side. Class IV may\nalso be sealed or unsealed. Improvement and maintenance costs were estimated for both.\n14. Costs for the core roads are based on detailed design and quantities of materials and\nother works needed. Numerous road projects have been externally funded in Viet Nam in recent\nyears provide an abundant construction cost data sources to draw on. Unit costs were derived\nfrom  these  data  and  applied  to  the  units  in  the  design  bills  of  quantities.  The  estimated\nconstruction costs were then appropriately adjusted to reflect economic costs. Typical financial\nand economic costs for improving the existing road to a sealed class V road are shown in Table\nA15.5. Most of the project roads are categorized as being between condition 3 and 4.\n                  \n1 A closure analysis can help justify incremental improvements to avoid future closures.", "Appendix 15, page 6\n71\nTable A15.5: Estimated Financial/Economic Costs for Upgrading\nExisting Roads to Class V Sealed Roads\n($\u2019 000)\nTerrain Type Condition 2a Condition 3 Condition 4 Condition 5\nMountainous 15,098/13,600 28,376/25,500 45,531/41,000 80,687/72,600\nRolling & Hilly 14,953/13,500 27,688/24,900 40,535/36,500 71,496/64,300\nFlat and Level 14,862/13,400 27,668/24,900 38,139/34,300 64,143/57,700\na Condition 1 = newly paved roads, 2 = good condition with IRI of 6.00, 3 = fair with IRI of 9.00, 4 = poor with IRI of\n12.00, 5 = bad with IRI of 15.00.\nNote: IRI is the international roughness index for roads.\n15. A thorough analysis of the cost of maintaining improved gravel surfaced and DBST\nsurfaced  roads  was  undertaken.  Gravel  surfaced  roads  require  rather  equipment  intensive\nmaintenance. This is because the passage of motor vehicles and the ravages of very strong\nseasonal rainfall common to the project area immediately affect and help deteriorate the gravel\nsurface.  Gravel  road  maintenance  tends  to  be  equipment  intensive.  For  example,  proper\nperiodic grading needed one to two times a year requires a grader, a water truck, a dump truck,\nand a vibratory roller, as well as operators and labor. Regraveling requires similar equipment.\nDBST roads except for the resealing that may be needed every 7 to 15 years generally require\nminimal equipment and easily transportable materials for typical maintenance. The comparative\ncosts for the two types of surfaces are shown in Table A15.6 categorized by equivalent 4-wheel\nvehicles.  This  analysis  clearly  shows  that  maintenance  of  gravel  roads  done  properly  is\nconsiderably  more  expensive  than  for  sealed  roads  with  equivalent  traffic  loadings.  While\nconstruction of a gravel surfaced road is roughly half the cost of a surfaced road, the lower\nmaintenance cost of the sealed road pays for itself in a very short time, say in about 5 to 7 years\nover a life of 20 years. Gravel roads would generally have greater roughness than a sealed road\nand thus higher VOCs. Roughness would also increase between maintenance operations.\nTherefore, and considering that the provinces have equipment and operating budget deficits\nand likely to remain that way for some time, DBST roads are preferred to gravel roads.\nTable A15.6: Comparative Financial/Economic Maintenance Costs\nfor Class V Improved Gravel vs DBST\n($\u2019 000 per year per km)\nType Cost\nGravel: Low Traffic Volumes, up to 45 FWV 2,100/1,900\nGravel: Medium Traffic Volumes up to 135 FWV 2,500/2,250\nGravel: Heavy Traffic Volumes up to 225 FWV 3,000/2,700\nDBST: Low Traffic Volumes up to 45 FWV 700/630\nDBST: Medium Traffic Volumes up to 135 FWV 800/720\nDBST: High Traffic Volumes up to 225 FWV 900/810\nDBST = double bituminous surface treatment; FWV = four-wheel vehicle; km = kilometer;  vs = versus.\nE. Benefits and Beneficiaries\n16. The  main  quantifiable  benefits  for  the  project  roads  are  based  on  VOC  savings.\nOperating costs are estimated to decline from about 40 percent to more than 60 percent\ndepending on the initial roughness and condition of the road. Travel time should typically be\nreduced by 50 or more. Impassability should be reduced from a few days to two to three months", "Appendix 15, page 7\n72\na year to a negligible amount of time. This strongly suggests that nonquantified benefits will be\nsubstantial, for example, quicker, less costly and more reliable market access for farmers and\ntradespeople, increased access for social communications, decreased time for the movement of\ntrade goods and higher reliability, and in general, better transport services for the entire project\narea population including people served by recently improved district and commune roads but\nconnecting with provincial roads in very poor condition. Directly affected will be the 4 million\npeople living within the zones of influence of the project roads, as well as people living outside\nthe zone of influence who will now be able to interact economically and socially with the project\narea population. The reduced VOC and travel time resulting from improvement of the project\nroads will benefit road users, including the local population as well as commercial operators that\nwill now be able to provide transport services at a reasonable cost and frequency. Since\ntransport charges mainly depend on road conditions, a portion of the VOC savings are to be\npassed on to the road users. Through greater transport efficiencies, the road improvements will\nhelp  enable  small-scale  producers  to  participate  more  actively  in  the  market  economy\n(Supplementary Appendix D more information on the likely effects and beneficiaries).\nF. Economic Evaluation\n17. The economic evaluation has followed the standard approach of estimating the costs\nand benefits and then determining the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) following a\nprocess of iterative discounting until the benefit-cost ratio is equal to one. VOCs were calculated\nbased  on  HDM-4  and  particularly  the  HDM-VOC  subroutine,  while  other  costs  such  as\nresettlement, repair/replacement of existing bridges, construction of new bridges, supervision\ncosts, and physical contingencies have been introduced exogenously. Nonmotorized traffic\nbenefits were included in the analysis and contribute up to 10 percent to the benefit stream. A\nsummary of the economic analysis for the core roads is given in Table A15.7.\nTable A15.7: Summary of Economic Evaluation for the Core Roads\n(in percent)\n20% 20%\nBase Capital VOC Combination Switching\nRoad Case Cost Savings Case1 + Value\nNumber EIRR Increase Reduction Case 2 At 12%\n(Case 1) (Case 2) Benefits Costs\n0103 59.0 50.2 48.4 41.2 -81 440\n0202 11.7 9.3 8.8 6.7 -9 26\n0307 60.7 51.2 49.3 41.6 -78 350\n0601 148.7 124.7 119.8 100.5 -89 850\n0701 13.7 10.9 10.3 7.7 -11 23\n1101 19.1 15.8 15.1 12.1 -34 51\n1401 42.6 35.9 34.6 29.0 -68 212\n1508 40.9 34.8 33.6 28.5 -72 252\n1718 109.5 92.0 88.5 74.5 -88 729\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. VOC = vehicle operating cost.\n18. The EIRRs have a broad range reflecting the condition of the road and as importantly\nthe current level of traffic and economic prosperity of the area served. Poor people don\u2019t have\nvehicles and don\u2019t travel much especially if travel is very difficult and expensive in time and cost.\nThe roads with high EIRRs are characterized by very high volumes of motorized traffic ranging\nfrom 420 vpd to 1,809 vpd but up to 86 percent of this traffic comprises motorcycles.

Subproject Preparation\n19. The core roads represent a sample of the universe of provincial roads prepared in a form\nthat  is  acceptable  for  ADB  approval.  The  feasibility  study  prepared  under  TA  3455-VIE:\nProvincial Roads Improvement Project provides most of the data required for selection and\nprioritization of the project roads. It does not and could not provide the full documentation\nrequired for approval of individual subprojects because of time and funds constraints. Additional\nwork, including economic evaluation, will be required under the proposed loan and include, in\naddition to the material prepared under the TA, a formal request to ADB for approval of future\nsubprojects. The request for subproject approval will include: (i) cover sheet, (ii) basic data\nsheet including EIRR, (iii) map, (iv) an initial environmental examination (IEE) or summary\nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA) in ADB format, (v) approval from Ministry of Science,\nTechnology and Environment (MOSTE) either registration letter or other approval, and (vi)\nresettlement plan and ethnic minority development plan, in a format acceptable to ADB.
