INTRODUCTION\n1. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for\ntechnical assistance (TA) to build the capacity of the China Securities Regulatory Commission\n(CSRC).  The  TA,  which  aims  to  strengthen  oversight,  market  surveillance,  and  enforcement\ncapacities of CSRC and key securities institutions, will build on previous ADB support for the PRC\ncapital market.1 This support facilitated (i) gradual development of basic policy, legal, and regulatory\nframeworks for the securities market in the early 1990s; (ii) establishment of the National Electronic\nTrading in Securities system; and (iii) finalization of the National Securities Law that paved the way\nfor the reconstitution of CSRC with powers to operate as a sole regulator of the securities market.\n2. The development of the PRC\u2019s capital market is critical to effective restructuring of financial\ninstitutions and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Capital markets will provide the needed local and\nforeign long-term funding and improve the corporate governance structure of PRC enterprises, while\ncreating pressures to integrate the country into a globalized and competitive economic environment.\nKeeping these objectives in perspective, the proposed TA seeks to strengthen (i) the oversight role\nof  CSRC  and  Self  Regulatory  Organizations  (SROs);2  (ii)  securities  regulatory  framework;\n(iii) disclosure and transparency in line with international best practices; and (iv) training of CSRC\nstaff and market participants in securities regulation and market supervision and surveillance. The\nTA Fact-finding Mission visited the PRC in May 1999 and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment on the objectives, scope, and financing and implementation arrangements of the TA.3\nThe logical framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The PRC securities industry is largely state-owned. It includes CSRC (the regulator), 2 stock\nexchanges, about 90 brokerage firms mostly owned by state-owned financial or other institutions,\nover 200 securities trading units controlled by trust and investment companies, 12 closed-end\nmutual funds,4 over 30 insurance companies, and a few leasing and financing companies. The law\nprohibits commercial banks from engaging in trust, investment or stock activities, and investing in\nnonbank financial institutions. During the 1990s, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) was responsible\nfor licensing securities dealers, while CSRC regulated secondary market activities, and the local\ngovernments exercised delegated legislative and regulatory powers in their regions. This structure\nencouraged different standards of regulations, bureaucratic overlap and confrontation, and weak\nprudential supervision, which together created opportunities for malpractice in the market.\n4. As an initial step, PRC consolidated the complex, multilayered, and fragmented institutional\nframework to a single authority, i.e., CSRC. Established in October 1992,5 CSRC was initially\noverseen  by  the  State  Council  Securities  Commission  (SCSC)  that  was  entrusted  with\nmacroregulation and regional coordination of the securities market, and the responsibility to draft\npolicies, guidelines, and laws for the market. CSRC operated as an executive arm of SCSC with\nresponsibility to formulate and enforce regulatory rules and guidelines for securities activities. PBC\n                                                       \n1  TA 1516-PRC: Development of Securities Market, for $600,000 approved on 27 May 1991; TA 1748-PRC:\nEstablishment of National Securities System, for $100,000 approved on 19 August 1992; TA 1887-PRC:\nRegulation and Supervision of Securities Markets, for $600,000 approved on 17 May 1993; TA 2512-PRC:\nIntegration of Securities Markets, $600,000 approved on 27 December 1995; and TA 3032-PRC: Legislation\nDrafting Support for PRC Securities Law, $150,000 approved on 24 June 1998.\n2  SROs include the securities and futures exchanges and the Securities Association.\n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in July 1999.\n4  Such funds have a limited number of shares outstanding, compared to an open-end fund that creates new\nshares to meet investor demand.\n5  Through the circular on Further Strengthening Macro-Regulation of the Securities Market.", "2\nmaintained its jurisdiction over the licensing of the securities institutions and the regional securities\ntrading  centers,  and  cross-trading  arrangements.  The  local  governments  supervised  stock\nexchanges  based on  CSRC  regulations.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  handled  the  registration  of\naccountants and accounting firms.\n5. Subsequently, CSRC was empowered6 with administrative and regulatory jurisdiction over\nall securities agencies and their registration. CSRC delegated its powers to the local agencies to\ninvestigate and enforce the regulations. In mid-1998, CSRC was merged with SCSC and elevated\nto  ministerial  status.  To  eliminate  local  government  interference,  nine  regional  offices  were\nestablished to provide CSRC with a network to enforce its own regulations. Finally, on 28 December\n1998 with the passage of the National Securities Law, CSRC was reconstituted and assigned full\njurisdiction over the securities activities, and all powers of the PBC and local governments in this\narea were transferred to CSRC.\n6. The  PRC\u2019s  two  national  stock  exchanges  in  Shanghai  and  Shenzhen7  commenced\noperations in 1991. The country also experimented with two national over-the-counter trading\nsystems,  the  National  Electronic  Trading  in  Securities  and  the  Securities  Trading  Automated\nQuotation System.8 From 1993, a number of provincial trading centers were also established; those\nin Shenyang, Wuhan, and Tianjin became the largest. As part of its effort to strengthen market\nregulation, the Government closed all these trading centers by early 1999. There are also three\nfutures exchanges: the Shanghai Futures  Exchange, the  Dalian  Commodities  Exchange, and\nZhenzhou Commodities Exchange. The former opened in May 1999 with 230 members and an\naverage daily turnover of Y2 billion- Y3 billion. Six commodity futures contracts are currently traded,\nincluding copper, aluminum, and rubber in Shanghai; wheat and green beans in Zhenzhou; and\nsoybeans in Dalian.9\n7. Under the regulations, stock exchanges are nonprofit SROs. By the end of April 1999, the\ntwo  stock  exchanges  had  868  listed  companies  with  an  aggregate  market  capitalization  of\nY1,951 billion ($236 billion), equivalent to almost one-fourth of the gross domestic product. By the\nend of 1998, the annual turnover of listed securities was Y2,354 billion ($284 billion), while new\nissues, rights issues, and issues of convertible bonds grew to Y266 billion ($32 billion). SOE issues\nlead the growth of the equities market. A large percentage of these SOE shares are nontradable\nbecause of concerns of company ownership falling to the nonstate sector. The listing process of\ncompanies  at  an  exchange  is  guided  by  a  quota  system.  Share  issues  are  priced  using\nadministrative  guidelines  that  restrict  proper  market-based  valuation  of  companies.  Tradable\nshares10 represent only 34 percent of market capitalization of exchanges. Ownership segregates\ntrading on exchanges with A-shares held by domestic persons, while B-shares are exclusively\nrestricted to foreign investors. To date, about $4.6 billion has been raised from B-shares floated by\n106 companies. Since 1992, registered companies have been allowed to list their shares on\ninternational markets11 and raised $16 billion. Market regulations vary for different types of shares,\nand this induces variations in price/earnings ratios.\n                                                       \n6  Through the 1996 Regulations on Securities Exchanges and Decision on the Deregulation of Certain Regulatory\nand Supervisory Powers to the Local Securities and Futures Regulatory Agencies.\n7  The Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n8  The former was merged into the Shanghai Securities Central Registration and Settlement Company in 1993; and\nthe latter, established to trade legal person shares, is moribund.\n9 Approval from the Government has been sought to trade six other commodity contracts.\n10 In March 1999, the 86.2 billion securities were tradable out of 252.7 billion listed securities.\n11  These included the Hong Kong, New York, London, and Australian stock exchanges.", "3\n8. Supporting  the  securities  market  activities  are  about  90  brokerage  firms  whose\n2,412 branches serve over 39 million registered investors. Collective investment vehicles have not\nfully taken off in the PRC. Presently, there are only 12 closed-end mutual funds capitalized at\nY2 billion -   Y3  billion  each,  with  an  investment  life of  15  years.  CSRC,  jointly  with  relevant\nauthorities, licenses all market intermediaries engaged in, or related, to securities activities.\n9. Despite its recent growth, the PRC securities market has not been effectively exploited.\nDevelopment of a strong and effective regulator that encourages orderly growth will provide an\nimpetus to the securities market. The Securities Law defines the obligations of the regulator,\nincluding imposing greater discipline on all market participants. However, the law needs to address\na few fundamental structural problems such as (i) the segregation of A-, B-, and other shares and\ntheir market regulations; (ii) the state\u2019s domination of market capitalization and the nontradability of\nits  shares;  and  (iii)  improper  valuation  and  pricing  during  the  initial  public  offering  process.\nWeaknesses in regulation, and market compliance and surveillance have encouraged a high degree\nof volatility and market segmentation. Lack of a code of conduct and investor protection has allowed\nmisconduct by the securities companies to occur, and resulted in irregular practices such as insider\ntrading, misappropriation of clients\u2019 funds, and market manipulation. Market intermediaries do not\nhave  proper  access  to  financing  and  operate  without  adequate  safeguards  and  internal  risk\nmanagement systems.\n10. To monitor and control financial and operational risks of securities trading, the trading,\nclearing, and settlement systems of the securities and futures exchanges must be enhanced. The\nsecurities exchanges\u2019 clearing and settlement systems are integrated with their trading systems to\nfacilitate settlement of A-shares on a T+112 and a delivery-versus-payment basis. An investor must\nhave an account with both exchanges to be able to trade all A-listed securities. At the time of\nentering a trade, the buying client\u2019s funds are transferred to the buying broker to ensure settlement,\nwhile the selling client\u2019s securities are transferred to the selling broker. However, before settlement,\nthe clients are exposed to a number of risks including broker insolvency, fraud within the broker\u2019s\noffice, and funds and securities being used illegally for other activities.\n11. The settlement systems for equity securities are not sufficiently flexible to support future\ndevelopment of the markets. There are no facilities to accommodate joint holdings, stock lending, or\nborrowing, or to achieve true delivery-versus-payment. Brokers cannot net their trades across\nsystems. Consequently, neither the exchanges nor CSRC can easily monitor the extent to which\nany broker is at risk from large unsettled transactions, failed settlements, or delayed payments. The\ndevelopment of a nationwide and centralized method of operation for the registration and clearing of\nsecurities  is  required  for  depository  institutions  to  comply  with  the provisions  of  the  National\nSecurities Law, and to improve efficiency and minimize settlement risks.\n12. To enhance the credibility of capital markets, CSRC needs to upgrade and standardize the\nregulation, supervision, and enforcement of the securities and futures markets in the PRC to assure\nmarket participants of fair and reliable dealings. CSRC needs to provide greater vision and direction\nto capital market institutions and participants, develop subordinate legislation to operationalize the\nNational  Securities  Law,  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  in  line  with  the  objectives  and\nprinciples of the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) and other best\npractices,  and  operate  as  an  effective  regulator  through  improved  market  surveillance  and\nenforcement mechanisms. Parallel to that, the SROs operating at the front line need to improve their\ngovernance structure so that they can play a more effective role in listing and pricing securities,\n                                                       \n12  Trade date plus one business day.
