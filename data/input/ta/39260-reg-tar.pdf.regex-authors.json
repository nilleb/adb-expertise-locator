To provide relevant information and analysis, to contribute to the intellectual environment \nin which policy formulation occurs, and to maintain and enhance its reputation as a credible and \nauthoritative  source  of  knowledge  about  the  region,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nregularly  monitors  and  offers  commentary  about  evolving  developments  in  its  developing \nmember countries (DMCs). The Asian Development Outlook1 (ADO) is the principal vehicle for \nthe delivery of these services region wide.   ADO content also informs Management opinion and \nguides institutional views about prospective developments and other important issues. The ADO \nhas  been  a  flagship  publication  of  ADB  since  1989.    The  preparation,  publication,  and \ndissemination of the ADO have been regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding.  \nAppendix 1 sets out the objectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the proposed regional \nTA2.   \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Ongoing efforts to improve the quality of the ADO are focused on providing stronger \nanalytical content and ensuring better cohesion and balance among its different parts. These \ninitiatives respond to feedback from clients and to a changing environment and market for \neconomic information and analysis. Efforts to improve the quality of analysis will include (i) \ncommissioning  of  relevant  applied  and  policy  research  at  country  and  regional  levels;  (ii) \nincreased application of appropriate modeling and other analytical tools; (iii) development of \nnew  sources  of  information;  and  (iv)  improvement  of  peer  review,  drawing  on  in-country \nexpertise. In an increasingly competitive market for knowledge and information, high-quality \nediting services are critical to ensure that ADO\u2019s key messages are communicated as effectively \nas possible.  The Economics and Research Department (ERD) will continue to work with the \nDepartment of External Relations (DER) to increase ADO\u2019s regional and international reach.   \n \n3.  The rational for the TA is to support activities that will contribute to high-quality content \nand help ensure the usefulness and relevance of the ADO to policy discussions and formulation. \nCurrently, the ADO is the most frequently downloaded publication from ADB\u2019s website and is \ndirectly  or  indirectly  the  source  of  much  international  and  national  news  commentary  that \nfeatures analysis, views, and opinions from ADB.  Elevating ADO\u2019s profile further and widening \nits influence will require a concerted effort, not just to improve quality but to differentiate content. \n  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The main outputs from the TA will be ADO 2006 and ADO 2006 Update. Activities \nsupported under the TA will also feed into the preparation of subsequent years\u2019 ADOs.  Draft \ncontents pages of ADO 2006 and ADO 2006 Update are in Appendix 2.   The major thematic \nfocus in 2006 will have three pillars linked to issues of trade integration and liberalization: (i) \nbehind-the-border impediments to trade within developing Asia and between developing Asia \nand the rest of the world; (ii) developing Asia\u2019s evolving interests in the Doha Round (post Hong \n                                                 \n1 ADO is sold externally and is extensively reviewed and commented on in the media. It is also the most popular \ndocument on the ADB website. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 17 June 2005. \n ", "2   \nKong, China); and (iii) impact of the cessation of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement on developing \nAsia.  It is expected that one or more of these issues will feature in most country chapters as \nwell as be covered at a regional and subregional level in parts 1 and 3.   Depending on future \ndevelopments,  ADO  2006  may  also  provide  a  more  substantial  analysis  of  the  possible \nconsequence of an Avian flu pandemic for developing Asia. \n \n5.  The  TA  will  further  develop  economic  forecasting  and  policy  analysis  models  and \ntechniques in support of ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term country economic analysis. The models \nwill be used to generate short- and medium-term economic forecasts in the country chapter of \nADO 2006 and ADO 2006 Update, as well as to strengthen the economic underpinnings of \ncountry programs and strategies for the DMCs covered. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The key activities to be supported by the TA will include (i) preparation of background \nanalytical papers, (ii) further development and refinement of empirical projection methods and \nother analytical tools, (iii) drafting of ADO content, (iv) economic and copy editing, and (v) \npreparation  and  layout  of  materials  for  publication.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  finance  the \nprocurement of information and knowledge services that may be required to support high-quality \nand up-to-date content; and support workshops, seminars and training activities that are directly \nrelevant to the preparation and strengthening of the ADO.   \n \n7.  The terms of reference for the background analytical papers will be prepared by the \nMacroeconomics  and  Finance  Research  Division  (ERMF)  in  consultation  with  operational \ndepartments, as relevant.   The objective of these papers will be to nurture substantive ADO \ncontent.   On a case-by-case basis, resources will be provided to resident missions (RMs) to \nprepare country background papers on areas of agreed-upon thematic focus. \n \n8.  The TA will support the continued use of quantitative tools for economic analysis and \nforecasting. Key activities will include support for consultants and resource persons to maintain \nand update databases, to reestimate model equations (as required), and to further develop and \napply automatic leading indicators.    \n \n9.  Economic and copy editing activity will be provided by consultants working under the \ndirection of the assistant chief economist, ERMF.   High-quality editing services are crucial to \nensure cohesion of content and consistency in approach across the different chapters and parts \nof the ADO. \n \n10.  Training  activities  will  focus  on  extending  knowledge  of  statistical  methods  and \ndatabases, economic projection methods and other relevant skills.  As appropriate, training will \ntarget economists in operations departments, national officers in resident missions (RMs), and, \nas appropriate, government officials and other client groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $340,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \n ", "  3\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA.  \nIn particular, ERMF will implement the TA in close collaboration with regional departments (East \nand Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Mekong, and Pacific), and RMs.   The assistant \nchief  economist,  ERMF,  reporting  to  the  chief  economist,  ERD,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation. At each step in the preparation of the ADO, ERD will report to the Vice-\nPresident, Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Group and to the President.   \n \n13.  Developing analytical approaches and tools to support high-quality ADO content will \nbe  a  collaborative  effort  involving  ERMF  economists,  country  economists  of  the  regional \ndepartments  (RDs)  and  RMs,  national  experts,  international  consultants  and  high-quality \neconomics editors. The TA will finance the procurement of information and knowledge services \nthat may be required to support high-quality and up-to-date content. Procurement will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA is expected to start in December \n2005 and to be completed by December 2006. \n \n14.  The ADO training workshop for the country chapter writers on macroeconomics and \neconomic projections is tentatively scheduled for November 2006 at ADB headquarters.   The \nnumber of participants will be limited to maximize quality interaction.  The possibility of a second \nconference on the use of modeling methods will also be considered. \n \n15.  For ADO 2006 and ADO 2006 Update, it is estimated that 150 consultancy days for \ndomestic consultants will be required to help prepare the thematic content.  Appendix 4 gives \nthe outline terms of reference for the macroeconomic and thematic specialists. In addition, the \nADO will require 4 person-months of international consultancy resources for the preparation of \nthematic  chapters  and  background  papers.    Another  7  person-months  of  international \nconsultants\u2019 time will be required for economic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before \nfinal publication. The consultants will be hired as individuals. Resource persons will also be \nengaged to conduct training workshops and prepare background papers on economic trends in \nand  prospects  of  selected  DMCs.  Terms  of  reference  for  these  consultants  and  resource \npersons are attached.  ADB will engage the consultants and resource persons in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants.  \n \n16.  ADB staff will disseminate the major results of ADO 2006 and ADO 2006 Update to the \nmedia, DMC policy makers, and civil society. The TA will support translation of the ADO into \nChinese  and  Russian  languages  to  extend  its  audience  in  selected  DMCs.    This  will  be \narranged by RDs in consultation with the concerned RMs. The dissemination activities will be \ncoordinated by DER in cooperation with ERMF. In selected DMCs, the RMs will undertake \nseparate launches and will be supported by ERMF. Both ADO 2006 and ADO 2006 Update will \nbe featured on the ADB website and printed copies will be distributed worldwide. In countries \nwhere broadband access is limited, CD-ROMs will be made available through the RMs. ERMF \nwill work with DER to attempt to capture broader and more useful client feedback.   This activity \nmay require some limited TA resources.  ERMF will circulate internally a report on the outcome \nof the automatic leading indicators modeling exercises with proposals on how to build on this TA \nfor future issues of the ADO and in possible applications of the macroeconometric models in \ncountry work. \n \n \n ", "4   \nIV.
