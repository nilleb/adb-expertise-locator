The proposed regional technical assistance will undertake a feasibility study covering \neconomic,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  issues,  to  complete  the  Southern  Coastal \nCorridor (the Corridor) linking Thailand, Cambodia, and Viet Nam. The Corridor is part of the \nSouthern Economic Corridor flagship program\u20141 of 11 flagship programs of the 10-year Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Strategic Framework, which was endorsed by the GMS Summit of \nLeaders in Phnom Penh in November 2002. This TA was included in the 2004-2008 Regional \nCooperation Strategy and Program for the GMS.1 A mission visited Cambodia and Viet Nam \nduring 18-29 October 2004 and held discussions with their governments on the proposed TA. \nAgreement was reached on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.2 A design and monitoring framework \nfor the TA is in Appendix 1.3\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Fifth  Ministerial  Conference  on  Subregional  Cooperation,  held  in  Manila  in \nNovember 1995, adopted the Summary of the Second Meeting of the Subregional Transport \nForum, including a recommendation to study the southern coastal road corridor linking Thailand, \nCambodia, and Viet Nam. In response to a request from the Cambodian delegation, a regional \nTA4 was prepared for approval in 1996, but implementation was suspended due to political \nunrest in Cambodia, and the approval lapsed. \n \n3.  At the Sixth Meeting of the Subregional Transport Forum held in Vientiane, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  in  May  2001,  the  Vietnamese  delegation  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) consider funding the rehabilitation of highways 63 and 80 as part of \nthe Southern Coastal Corridor Project. As a result, the project was reinstated to the TA program. \nHowever, during the Country Programming Mission to Cambodia in April 2003, the Government \nadvised ADB that other external funding agencies had taken up most sections of the proposed \nproject  within  Cambodia  and  no  significant  funding  was  required.  To  determine  what  was \nrequired to complete the Corridor, a small-scale TA5 was approved in 2003. It focused on the \nViet Nam portion of the Corridor from Ha Tien to Nam Can but reviewed the status of the \nCorridor as a whole. The final report from the TA presented a preliminary analysis of the \nVietnamese portion of the Corridor, indicating that there was a viable project to upgrade it. The \nreport recommended that a more detailed study confirm the TA\u2019s conclusions. The final report \nalso noted that the final 17-kilometer section of road connecting to the Cambodia\u2013Viet Nam \nborder  required  upgrading  to  complete  the  Cambodian  section  of  the  Corridor,  that  the \nCambodia\u2013Viet Nam border crossing needed to be upgraded to an international crossing, and \nthat facilities to support this border crossing should be provided. \n \n4.  While Cambodia and Viet Nam have not traded much along the Corridor, empirical \nobservations of activities at the existing border show that future trade has considerable potential. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 October 2004. \n2  Memorandums of agreement were signed by the governments of Cambodia and Viet Nam, indicating that they had \nno objection to the TA. \n3  A draft of this paper was circulated for interdepartmental comments on 10 December 2004. \n4  ADB. 1996.Technical Assistance for the Thailand-Cambodia-Viet Nam Southern Coastal Road Corridor. Manila (TA \n5691-REG). \n5  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the Southern Coastal Corridor. Manila (TA 6134-REG). ", "2 \nGiven a good road network in Ca Mau and Kien Giang provinces in Viet Nam, and the opening \nof  the  border  at  Xa  Xia  in  Viet  Nam  and  Lork  in  Cambodia,  international  trade  could  be \nsignificant. The final report from the small-scale TA (footnote 5) notes that this trade would \ninitially be between Viet Nam and Cambodia, but that linkages between Thailand and Viet Nam \nwould develop once trade routes and markets were established. In Cambodia, the southern \ncoastal  region  is  an  emerging  industrial  zone  centered  on  the  international  seaport  in \nSihanoukville. Developments in this zone will take advantage of planned exploitation of natural \ngas resources in the Gulf of Siam, tight subregional transport links to the established industrial \nzones in the Eastern Seaboard in Thailand, and the rapidly developing agro- and aqua-based \nindustries in southern Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, these industries are rapidly being promoted to \nexport  processed  food  products  as  significant  foreign  exchange  earners.  These  products, \nespecially those based on fish and fish produce, must be quickly processed and frozen. Inland \ntransport of such products is almost always by truck with refrigerated units, rather than inland \nwaterways, which are not as fast and increase losses. An industrial estate is proposed near Ca \nMau City, where urea fertilizer and other goods requiring either natural gas or electrical power \nwould be produced at combined low labor cost. Other items coming from Viet Nam that could \nuse the Corridor include fertilizers, processed foods, and other consumer goods. \n \n5.  In Viet Nam, funding of road maintenance and capacity building for road maintenance \nplanning  and  implementation  are  being  addressed  under  ADB\u2019s  Third  Road  Improvement \nProject and the World Bank\u2019s Road Network Improvement Project. In Cambodia, a national \nstrategy is being prepared and will be taken up under the proposed transport infrastructure \ndevelopment and maintenance project to be prepared in 2005. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  access  and  connectivity,  nationally  and \nsubregionally, along the Cambodian and Vietnamese sections of the Corridor. The outcome of \nthis TA is a project design and feasibility study agreed to by the governments and the ADB that \nsets out an economically, technically, socially, and environmental feasible project to rehabilitate \nand upgrade transport links and facilities along the Corridor. The project directly supports ADB\u2019s \nGMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program\u2019s6 strategic thrust of enhancing connectivity \nand  facilitating  cross-border  transport  among  Thailand,  Cambodia,  and  Viet  Nam,  thereby \nfostering economic and social integration and supporting increased trade and investment in the \nSouthern Economic Corridor. \n \n7.  The TA outputs will include the following: (i) analyses of transport links and determination \nof the economic, technical, social, and environmental feasibility for (a) each component, (b) \ncomponents within each country, and (c) the project as a whole; (ii) a matrix ranking components \nand options for combinations of components to form logical projects for a range of funding \nlevels; (iii) determination of facilities required at the Cambodian\u2013Viet Nam border on the project \nroad; and (iv) a multimodal study on the movement of goods and people within the project-\ninfluenced area. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004\u20132008. Manila.  ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The starting point for the study will be the final report from the small-scale TA (footnote \n5).  This  final  report  established  the  project\u2019s  viability  based  on  a  preliminary  analysis  that \nfocused on the Vietnamese portion of the Corridor. This regional TA will initially consider the \nCambodian and Vietnamese sections of the project separately, and the whole project from a \nsubregional perspective. For the Cambodian portion, the objective will be to establish the means \nto connect Route Nationale 33 with the Lork border crossing to Viet Nam. The TA will identify \nalternative routes; analyze these alternatives for technical, economic, social, and environmental \nfeasibility; and recommend the optimum alignment and standard of construction.  \n \n9.  The final report for the small-scale TA noted that for the Vietnamese portion of the \nproject,  the  movement  of  goods  and  people  within  a  multimodal  framework  should  be \nunderstood more. In particular, significant volumes of goods are moved along the extensive \nnetwork of inland waterways within the project-influenced area, and the transfer of goods from \ninland waterways to upgraded roads may have a significant impact on the project. The final \nreport for the small-scale TA noted that because the existing road network between Rach Gia, in \nKien Giang Province, and Ca Mau, in Ca Mau Province, is only accessible to light trucks, then \nany trade between the two provinces may be conducted via Can Tho to the northeast on the \nMekong River. The multimodal study of the movement of goods and people will (i) identify the \norigin and destination of movements, (ii) identify tariff structures, (iii) determine volumes of \ngoods  and  numbers  of  passengers,  and  (iv)  determine  the  characteristics  of  goods  and \npurposes of journeys and estimate transfers to project roads. The study results will be used to \nanalyze road options between Rach Gia and Ca Mau. \n \n10.  From Xa Xia to Rach Gia, the alignment of the project road is clear. However, from Rach \nGia to Ca Mau there are alternative routes, of which only one was considered under the small-\nscale TA. Therefore, this regional TA will determine alternatives for this section of the Corridor \nand determine upgrading levels that are technically, economically, socially, and environmentally \nfeasible.  These  results  will  then  be  gathered  into  a  matrix  format  to  determine  viable \nimprovement  levels  for  each  link  for  a  range  of  funding  options.  The  matrix  will  allow \nidentification of optimum improvement packages for the project\u2019s Vietnamese section within \nbudget constraints. \n \n11.  Based on the results of the work on the Cambodian and Vietnamese sections, the project \nas a whole will be analyzed to determine (i) its economic viability, as compared to the separate \nnational components; and (ii) the distribution of benefits between Cambodia and Viet Nam. \n \n12.  The project\u2019s environmental impacts will be generally minor, as the work will principally \nconsist of rehabilitating and widening roads. However, several protected and sensitive areas are \nclose to some road sections. To ensure that environmental impacts on these areas are fully \nidentified  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  designed,  the  TA  includes  preparation  of \nenvironmental impact assessments for the project\u2019s Cambodia and Viet Nam sections. \n \n13.  The project\u2019s initial poverty and social assessment (Appendix 2) notes that significant \nnumbers of the Khmer minority live in the Vietnamese project area. Preliminary surveys suggest \nthat no ethnic minorities live in the Cambodian project area, but this is to be confirmed. The TA \nwill  determine  if  a  project  component  will  significantly  benefit  or  harm  an  ethnic  minority \ncommunity. If so, then an ethnic minority development plan or framework will be developed. \nImproving roads will require acquisition of land and resettlement of project-affected people. Initial \nassessments  indicate  that  resettlement  impacts  will  be  significant  in  the  Cambodian  and ", "4 \nVietnamese project areas. Therefore, the TA will prepare full resettlement plans in accordance \nwith ADB policies and guidelines. \n \n14.  As the project will support a regional transport corridor, risks include transmission of \nHIV/AIDs,7 and human trafficking. These will be mitigated by developing awareness campaigns \nfor project area communities and for temporary communities around construction camps. These \ncampaigns will take account of ongoing programs and initiatives in the project area. \n \n15.  The TA will study facilities at the Lork\u2013Xa Xia border crossing and determine what it \nneeds to operate as an international crossing under the GMS Agreement on Facilitation of \nCross-Border Transport of Goods and People. During the December 2004 tripartite meeting for \nthe initial implementation of the GMS cross-border transport agreement for the Bavet-Moc Bai \nborder crossing points, the Cambodian and Vietnamese delegations agreed to include Lork\u2013Xa \nXia  in  the  list  of  protocol-1  border-crossing  points  by  executing  a  Memorandum  of \nUnderstanding, as called for in protocol 1 of the agreement. \n \n16.  The project area is heavily contaminated by unexploded ordinance. The TA includes \nsurveying the extent of contamination and to determine the extent of clearance requirements for \ncivil works. \n \n17.  Potential project risks include the following: (i) the Lork\u2013Xa Xia border crossing might not \nbe upgraded to an international crossing, (ii) low-capacity ferries and bridges on road links \nbetween Rach Gia and Ca Mau might not be upgraded, and (iii) other sections of the Corridor in \nCambodia might not be completed on time. The TA will assess each risk and develop mitigation \nmeasures or strategies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.22 million equivalent. ADB will finance $1 \nmillion equivalent; the TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  remaining  $220,000  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  the \ngovernments of Cambodia and Viet Nam through in-kind contributions of the executing agency \nand  provincial  counterpart  staff;  office  space,  transport,  and  local  communications  for  the \ncounterpart staff; and maps, reports, and other information. Detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 3. Both governments have been informed that TA approval does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  In Cambodia the Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT),  which  has  designated  the  General  Department  of  Public  Works  (GDPW)  as  the \nImplementing  Agency.  The  director  general,  GDPW,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the \ndepartment\u2019s contribution to the TA. In Viet Nam, the Executing Agency will be the Ministry of \nTransport (MOT), which has designated My Thuan project management unit (PMU-MT) as the \nImplementing Agency. The general director of PMU-MT will have overall responsibility for the \nunit\u2019s contribution to the TA. GDPW and PMU-MT will each set up a subunit staffed with \ncounterpart  personnel  for  day-to-day  coordination.  These  personnel  will  work  with  the  TA \n                                                 \n7 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "5 \nconsultant\u2019s personnel as well as other government agencies, particularly provincial departments \nof transport, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other interested parties.  \n \n20.  To oversee TA implementation, MPWT and MOT will establish a steering committee \ncomprising representatives from their countries\u2019 other ministries, provincial governments, and \nother government agencies. The committee will meet regularly, alternating between Phnom \nPenh and Ho Chi Minh. Depending on where they are held, meetings will be chaired by a senior \nofficial of either MPWT or MOT. \n \n21.  The TA will require about 163 person-months of consulting services, including about 24 \nof international and 139 of domestic consultants. The TA will be implemented over 10 months, \nfrom September 2005. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. Reporting requirements \ninclude the submission of inception, interim, draft final, and final reports, and brief monthly \nprogress reports. Tripartite meetings will be held after the submission of the inception, interim, \nand draft final reports. The meetings will alternate between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh. Two \nworkshops will be held after submission of the draft final report to present the project to the \ngovernments, NGOs, and other stakeholders. One workshop will be held in Phnom Penh and \nfocus on the Cambodian project components, and the other will be held in Ho Chi Minh and \nfocus  on  the  Vietnamese  components.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \ntransport planning and economics, highway design and maintenance, bridge maintenance, ferry \noperations,  environmental  impact  assessment,  resettlement,  social  issues,  and  institutional \ndevelopment. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection procedures; \nsimplified technical proposals will be requested. TA-financed equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. On TA completion, the equipment will be \nhanded over to the implementing agencies. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for \npreparing the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coastal Corridor Project, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia and Viet Nam \n \nCambodia.1 Poverty is overwhelmingly rural, from a low of 10-15% in Phnom Penh to 40-45% in the rural \nareas, reaching 60% in some provinces in the Tonle Sap Basin. Around 35-40% of the population has \nexpenditure levels below the income poverty line; 15-20% live in extreme poverty. Despite robust growth \nover the past decade, official figures indicate that poverty has declined only modestly from 39% in 1994 to \n36% in 1999.  \n \nOne cause of poverty is the lack of efficient access to markets. Transport is predominately by road, but \nmost of the road network, especially at the lower end and affecting rural and agriculture communities, is in \npoor condition. This has led to high transport costs and restricted the access of the poor to markets and \nsocial  services,  adversely  affecting  competitiveness,  expansion  of  economic  opportunities,  rural \nlivelihoods, and poverty reduction. Although notable progress has been made since the early 1990s in \nrestoring a core road network that interconnects the main centers in Cambodia, and the national economy \nwith  neighboring  countries,  much  remains  to  be  done.  Improved  access  is  a  cornerstone  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy as it helps reduce costs of farm inputs, increases prices paid to farmers, and opens \nup nonfarm income-earning opportunities.  \n \nViet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s impressive economic growth during the 1990s and early 2000s has been strongly \npro-poor. With only marginal increases in inequality, the proportion of people living below the total poverty \nline has dropped from 58% in 1993 to 32% in 2002. The proportion living below the food poverty line also \ndeclined from 25% to about 13%, indicating that even the poorest have benefited from economic growth. \nHowever, poverty is still high and remains a rural phenomenon, with about 45% of the rural population \nliving in poverty. Nearly all provinces have strikingly high rural poverty, suggesting that geographical and \nremoteness and disconnection from the rest of the economy are among the key factors in the spatial \ndistribution of poverty. \n \nConnectivity is a key factor for enabling the poor to respond to market incentives and to participate in \neconomic growth. Remoteness and disconnection are the key reasons for ethnic minorities\u2019 inability to \nbenefit from economic development. They are unable to develop existing skills and resources, and cannot \nimprove on low returns to capital. Improved transport infrastructure will contribute to regionally balanced \nand equitable economic growth by stimulating agricultural production, and increase access to jobs and to \nsocial  services  such  as  schools  and  extension  services.  The  opening  of  international  borders  and \nencouragement of cross-border trade will stimulate rural economic development, reflecting international \nmarket demand for local goods such as fruits and vegetables as well as economic inputs such as fertilizer \nand construction materials, among others. Tourism promises to create service sector jobs. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program 2005\u20132009: Cambodia.

It will assess the ability of the poor \nto benefit from the resulting economic activities, and review the potential barriers to the poor benefiting \nfrom economic growth. It will examine the role of connecting provincial and district roads as well as the \nrelated inland waterways in reducing poverty. The economic analysis will include a distributional analysis \nbetween stakeholders, including the poor. A poverty impact ratio will be calculated for the project. \n \nThe core analysis will be based on existing data such as the census, national socioeconomic surveys with \npoverty indicators, and the poverty database developed by the governments of Vietnam and Cambodia. \nThe study will make use of existing studies and reports. Additional quick rural appraisals and key informant \ninterviews will take place after data and information gaps in the analysis have been identified. Provincial \ndata on education and health will be collected to analyze the effect of road conditions and accessibility on \nsocial services.

Purpose and Outputs \n1.  The purpose of this regional technical assistance (TA) is to determine the economic, \ntechnical, social, and environmental feasibility of rehabilitating and upgrading transport links and \nfacilities along the Cambodian and Vietnamese sections of the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Southern Coastal Corridor (the Corridor). The TA outputs will include the following: (i) \nanalyses  of  transport  links  and  determination  of  the  economic,  technical,  social,  and \nenvironmental  feasibility  for  (a)  each  component  individually,  (b)  components  within  each \ncountry,  and  (c)  the  project  as  a  whole;  (ii)  a  matrix  ranking  components  and  options  for \ncombinations  of  components  to  form  logical  projects  for  a  range  of  funding  levels;  (iii)  a \ndetermination of facilities required at the Cambodia\u2013Viet Nam border on the project road; and \n(iv) a study on the movement of goods and people on the inland waterways within the project-\ninfluenced area in Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Terms of Reference  \n2.  The terms of reference for the services under the TA will include but not be limited to the \nfollowing tasks: \n(i)  Review the transportation network and pipeline of transport projects in the study \narea, including the planned upgrading of roads in Cambodia, and update their \nrespective improvement implementation schedules. In Viet Nam, the study will \nconfirm the transport links that will complete the Corridor. These transport links \nare  to  be  consistent  with  the  overall  project  rationale.  Existing  and  forecast \ntransport demand and expected trade flows will be estimated. \n(ii)  Evaluate the economic growth potential of the project area on the basis of existing \nand planned investment projects. Review and update potential population growth \nand potential for tourism development along the southern coast. The evaluation \nwill update the assessment of the potential for economic development along the \nCorridor. \n(iii)  Undertake a multimodal study on the movement of goods and people in the \nproject-influenced area. The study will (a) identify the origin and destination of \nmovements; (b) describe tariff structures and mechanisms by which these tariffs \nare adjusted; (c) determine volumes of goods and numbers of passengers, and; \n(d) determine the characteristics of goods and purposes of journeys for people, \nwhich can be used as the basis to estimate transfers to the project roads from \nother transport modes. The study results will be used to develop traffic forecasts \nfor the project in general and, in particular, applied to the analysis of road options \nbetween Rach Gia and Ca Mau. \n(iv)  Describe the provision of transport services within each country and between \ncountries along the project roads, evaluate competition in the provision of services \nand  setting  of  tariffs,  and  determine  the  project\u2019s  potential  to  improve  these \nservices. Determine how much benefit from improving the transport network will \nbe passed on to different end users, particularly the poor. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n(v)  Survey bridge conditions for each improvement option and implement a bridge \nrehabilitation and/or upgrading program based on projected loadings. \n(vi)  Study the river crossing at Tac Cau and present preliminary analyses and designs \nto allow comparison of the feasibility of alternatives for improvement of ferry \noperations and construction of a bridge. \n(vii)  Undertake safety audits for all roads for each improvement option. \n(viii)  Review the facilities at the Lork\u2013Xa Xia border crossing and determine what it \nneeds to operate as an international crossing under the GMS Agreement on \nFacilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People. This review should \ntake account of the adoption of \u201cextraterritorial performance of duties of border \nauthorities\u201d as the modality for implementing a single-stop inspection. \n(ix)  Based on the results of engineering investigations, prepare preliminary designs, \nconstruction quantities, and overall construction costs for each sample subproject \nroad  section  for  each  improvement  option.  Break  down  costs  into  foreign \nexchange, local currency, and tax components. Indicate direct and indirect foreign \nexchange separately. \n(x)  Calculate economic vehicle operating costs for each sample subproject with and \nwithout the proposed improvements, based on estimated changes in road surface \nroughness. Quantify the benefits (using shadow prices) for each project road \nsection and for each improvement option, including time savings generated from \nreduced  congestion  and  travel  distance,  road  maintenance  savings,  traffic \naccidents, etc.  \n(xi)  Determine  the  extent  of  unexploded  ordnance  contamination,  degrees  of \ncontamination, and costs for clearance under civil works contracts. \n(xii)  Assess the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) by homogenous road section \nbased on ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Derive appropriate \nsensitivity and switching values by varying the major parameters affecting project \nviability. Include a full distribution analysis. The economic analysis will use the \nHighway Design and Maintenance Standards Model IV (HDM IV) to evaluate the \nalternatives and assess the total life-cycle costs. The analysis will identify risks \nand undertake appropriate risk and sensitivity analysis with respect to EIRR in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. \n(xiii)  Based on the results of the work on the Cambodian and Vietnamese sections, the \nproject will be analyzed as a whole to determine economic viability, as compared \nto  the  separate  national  components,  and  distribution  of  benefits  between \nCambodia and Viet Nam. \n(xiv)  Prepare a matrix to determine viable levels of improvement for each link for a \nrange of funding options. It will allow identification of the optimum improvement \npackages for the Vietnamese section of the project within budget constraints and \nallow for the different options between Rach Gia and Ca Mau. \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \n(xv)  Prepare detailed poverty profiles of the communities traversed. In parallel and for \nthe  same  roads,  conduct  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  potential  for  road \nimprovements to reduce poverty. \n(xvi)  Undertake a poverty analysis focusing on the impact of the recommended road \nimprovements  on  the  provision  of  social  services,  movement  of  goods  and \npeople, and poverty reduction. The economic analysis will include distributional \nanalysis between stakeholders, including the poor. A poverty impact ratio will be \ncalculated for the project. \n(xvii)  The project\u2019s environmental impacts will generally be minor, as it will principally \nconsist of rehabilitation and widening of existing roads. However, a small-scale \nTA (footnote 5) identified several protected and sensitive areas close to some \nroad sections. To ensure that environmental impacts here are fully identified and \nappropriate mitigation measures designed, environmental impact assessments \nwill be prepared for the Cambodia and Viet Nam sections. The assessments will \nemphasize coastal habitats and pay particular attention to protected areas and \nother  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  assessments  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy and the guidelines available on the \nADB\u2019s website.1 \n(xviii)  Estimate  and  break  down  the  cost  of  implementing  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures,  monitoring  the  project,  and  developing  the  capacity  of  provincial \nauthorities  to  assess  and  monitor  environmental  impact  assessments  and \nenvironmental management plans. \n(xix)  Identify and prepare socioeconomic profiles of the project-affected communities in \naccordance with (a) ADB guidelines and publications, including Handbook on \nPoverty  and  Social  Analysis  (2001),  Handbook  on  Resettlement  (1998),  and \nHandbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects (1994); and (b) the \nrequirements of Cambodia and Vietnam, as appropriate. The profiles will include \ngender  and  local  ethnic  minority  profiles.  The  evaluation  will  describe  the \nincidence of poverty in the project area and assess the causes of poverty and the \nextent  to  which  the  project  will  address  them.  Ethnic  minorities  and  other \nvulnerable groups within the zone of influence should be identified, together with \nthe potential impact of the project on them. When negative impacts are identified, \nmitigation measures will be developed and their costs estimated. \n(xx)  Undertake social analysis as per the guidelines above and ADB's Policies on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995), Indigenous Peoples (1999), and Gender and \nDevelopment (1998). Review and assess the impacts of land acquisition or loss of \nland use on project-affected people (loss of homes, agricultural and other lands, \naccess to income-generating activities), including impacts caused by permanent \nor temporary acquisition.  \n(xxi)  As resettlement impacts will be significant, prepare a full resettlement plan for the \nproject components within each province along the project road as per ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \n                                                 \n1 At http://adb.org/documents/Guidelines/Environmental_Assessment/eaguidelines002.asp \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \nGood  Practice.  Stakeholders  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nshould participate fully in preparing the plan.  \n(xxii)  If the social analysis determines that ethnic minorities are likely to be affected \nsignificantly by the project or that they are disadvantaged or vulnerable because \nof their social or cultural identity, a time-bound ethnic minority development plan, \nincluding specific measures and approaches to address their concerns, must be \ndeveloped in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people. Stakeholders \nand the executing and implementing agencies should participate fully in preparing \nthe plan. \n(xxiii)  As the project is a regional transport corridor, HIV/AIDs transmission and human \ntrafficking  are  risks.  These  will  be  mitigated  by  awareness  campaigns  for \ncommunities  in  the  project  area  and  for  temporary  communities  around \nconstruction camps. These campaigns will take account of ongoing programs and \ninitiatives in the project area and will include the development of appropriate items \nto be included in civil works contracts. \n(xxiv)  Develop a detailed logical framework for the ensuing project, including goals, \npurpose,  outputs  with  corresponding  measurable  performance  indicators  and \ntargets, monitoring mechanisms, and risks and assumptions.  \n(xxv)  Assess  the  capacity  of  central  and  provincial  institutions  to  plan,  manage, \nimplement,  finance,  and  monitor  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and \nresettlement.
