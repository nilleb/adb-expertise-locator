INTRODUCTION \n1.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is designed to address \nissues affecting gender equality in the legal and other related sectors and to fill significant gaps \namong institutions. It aims to build a stronger, more inclusive society by (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of investigating, prosecuting, and decision-making bodies; and (ii) informing women of \ntheir rights, enabling them to access social and legal justice. It also aims to use existing networks \nand initiatives to achieve a nationwide outreach. The TA will help participating countries fulfill their \nobligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen (CEDAW), among others. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n2.  The TA will be conducted in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the possibility of expanding to \nTajikistan. Activities will be implemented independently in each participating country, keeping in \nmind how organizations in each country can collaborate with or learn from each other. \n \n3.  In its Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020: Moving \nthe Agenda Forward, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes that without harnessing the \ntalents, human capital, and economic potential of the women and girls who make up half of Asia\u2019s \npopulation, it will not realize its goal of a region free of poverty.2 The plan adopts gender \nmainstreaming as the key strategy to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \nacross all ADB operations. In 2016, countries will adopt the Sustainable Development Goals, \nwhich for the first time include a target for eliminating gender-based violence (GBV). \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132013 for Afghanistan (extended by the interim \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132015) lists gender and development as a priority.3 ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan acknowledges that large gender inequities \nremain and states that ADB support directly impacts women\u2019s empowerment and well-being.4 \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132014 for Tajikistan (extended by the interim country \npartnership strategy, 2015) identifies gender mainstreaming as a cross-cutting theme for ADB \ninterventions.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Typical issues include the following: (i) a dearth of research and data on the prevalence \nof GBV; (ii) poor understanding, awareness, or misinterpretation of women\u2019s legal rights; (iii) lack \nof access to information about available legal procedures and services; (iv) lack of gender \nsensitivity in the judiciary and the legal profession toward women\u2019s legal rights; (v) inadequate \nlegal aid to facilitate women\u2019s access to justice; (vi) inadequate institutional mechanisms; (vii) lack \nof coordination among key stakeholders; and  (viii) the existence of parallel legal systems, \nincluding mainstream courts, sharia courts, the panchayt (village council), and the jirga (traditional \nassembly of leaders).  \n \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 October 2015. \n2  ADB. 2013.

The sixth most populous country in the world, Pakistan has a population of \n185.1 million as of 2014, 48.6% of which is female.6 Institutional mechanisms to support gender-\nequality laws and policies exist at all levels of government, and the 1973 Constitution\u2014Articles \n25 and 28 in particular\u2014legally mandates gender equality along with other human rights.7 \nPakistan has also ratified all relevant United Nations (UN) treaties, including CEDAW. The \nMinistry of Women Development was established as the primary national mechanism to advance \nwomen and implement CEDAW, tasks that have since been devolved to the provinces through \nthe creation of women development departments. A National Commission on the Status of \nWomen  was  also  formed  to  combat  discrimination  against  women  in  compliance  with  the \ncountry\u2019s international obligations.8 In 2008, the Ministry of Human Rights (MOHR) was created \nunder the Ministry of Law and Justice, which is now the Ministry of Law, Justice and Human \nRights.9 The 18th amendment to the Constitution appointed the MOHR to deal with human rights \nand women\u2019s empowerment. These responsibilities were delegated to the Ministry of Law and \nJustice after the dissolution of the MOHR. \n \n7.  GBV in Pakistan is pervasive across class, religion, ethnicity, and the urban and rural \ndivide, being rooted in a patriarchal social structure in which women are viewed as property and \nsubservient to men.10 In 2009, a civil society organization (CSO) reported 8,548 cases of GBV, \nciting a 13% increase from the previous year (footnote 10). The same study noted that police \nrecords show 79,909 reported cases of GBV during 2000\u20132010 (footnote 10). In 2013, the MOHR \nrecorded 7,372 human rights violations, the majority of which involved honor killings, rapes, acid \nattacks, domestic violence, and sexual harassment.11 In terms of gender equity, Pakistan falls far \nbehind even the war-torn countries of Syria and Sudan.12 Women earn 21% less and receive 43% \nfewer educational opportunities than men. The rate of female participation in the labor force was \n26.4% in 2013, one of the lowest in Asia. Pakistan\u2019s gender equality legislation is minimally \nadequate and implementation remains weak due to several factors, including weak public sector \ncapacity, limited resources, and social and cultural constraints. \n \n8.  Afghanistan. Afghanistan\u2019s population as of 2014 was around 31.28 million, of which 49.3% \nis female. The 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan\u2014Articles 7, 22, 54, and 130 in particular\u2014sets \nout the legal framework for the protection and advancement of human rights, including women\u2019s \nrights. 13  The  Elimination  of  Violence  Against  Women  (EVAW)  Law  passed  in  2009  is \nAfghanistan\u2019s primary legislation on GBV and women\u2019s issues. The Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs \nestablished in 2001 is responsible for implementing the government\u2019s political and social policies \nto secure and expand the legal rights of women and ensure the rule of law in their lives.14 The \nAfghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) established in 2002  aims to \nmonitor, foster, and protect human rights in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a party to CEDAW, as \nwell as other significant international treaties. \n \n6  Government of Pakistan, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 2014.

Violence against women is considered a widespread and undeniable reality in Afghan \nsociety.15 According to a 2008 national survey by Global Rights Afghanistan, 87.2% of Afghan \nwomen and girls face at least one form of sexual, physical, economic, and psychological abuse.16 \nThe AIHRC reported that 6,611 cases were presented to its office in 2013, an increase of 16% \nfrom the previous year (footnote 15). Women and men are widely divided by certain traditions, \npractices, and perceptions of responsibilities. The rate of female labor force participation in 2013 \nwas estimated at 16%, the lowest in Asia.17 While EVAW is considered a significant achievement, \nits implementation remains challenging as the majority of law enforcement agencies are not fully \naware of this law nor of their obligations with respect to it. Women themselves are either unaware \nor lack understanding of EVAW. \n \n10.  Tajikistan. Tajikistan's population as of 2014 is 8.4 million, of which 49.8% are women. \nMore than 70% of the population lives in rural areas, reflecting the traditionally higher rural birth \nrate and the decline in urban employment.18 Along with other Central Asian states, Tajikistan has \nenshrined the declaration of gender equality in its Constitution and adopted a number of laws in \n2005\u20132013 to ensure gender equality.19 Under the Constitution, all individuals are equal before \nthe law and courts, rights and freedoms are guaranteed, and women and men have equal rights.20 \nTajikistan is also a party to and has ratified CEDAW. \n \n11.   One study found that 62%\u201372% of Tajik homes experienced domestic violence.21 During \na 2008 visit to Tajikistan, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women noted that women \nin Tajikistan were caught in a web of poverty, patriarchy, and a weak protective infrastructure, \nresulting in increased vulnerability to violence and discrimination inside and outside their homes.22 \nThis remains true, despite a female labor force participation rate of 58.9% in 2013. Significant \nbarriers preventing women from accessing justice include (i) unwillingness caused by shame to \ninvolve others in solving disputes; (ii) ignorance of the right to free legal counsel and of the fact \nthat the state does not recognize a marriage conducted by a religious person alone; (iii) a lack of \nresources and awareness; (iv) a lack of physical access to justice as many districts are large and \nsparsely populated; and (v) a dearth of lawyers in some areas of the country. \n \n12.  The significant economic and social costs of GBV impact not only women and girls \npersonally, but also their families and communities; the government, which provides health care; \nand the economy in general, which suffers from the lack of women\u2019s participation in governance \nand the labor force. \n \n13.

Improving women\u2019s \naccess to and ability to use legal tools will enable more effective and substantive gender \nmainstreaming of ADB investments in every sector. Legal tools and building the capacity of \ninstitutions and law enforcement bodies have also proven to be a very effective means of \nempowering women and implementing laws effectively. Work in the proposed countries is spurred \nby (i) high percentages of gender-based crimes and other inequalities, (ii) these countries\u2019 \ncommitment  to  improve  gender  equity  through  strong  national  strategies,  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to help the governments achieve their targeted goals as stated in ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategies. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the TA will be improved access to justice and social and other services for \nwomen in the participating countries. The outcome will be improved legal literacy with respect to \ngender-based crimes on the part of women; government, legal, and judicial officials; and religious \nand community leaders in the participating countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will involve activities aimed at addressing GBV and discrimination against women \nin the participating countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan). Information and training \nmodules will be disseminated to communities by leveraging existing local networks for nationwide \noutreach.  Implementing  partners  include  community  organizations,  CSOs,  and  government \nagencies. \n \n16.   Output 1: Increased capacity of the government, civil society organizations, and \nlegal and judicial officers to respond to clients on gender issues. This output includes (i) \nconducting  a  situational  analysis  and  needs  assessment  of  institutional  mechanisms  and \ncapacities to address women-related issues within the legislative and judicial systems (both \nformal and informal); (ii) providing institutional support and addressing capacity gaps and issues \nby training government officials, legal and judicial officers, and informal dispute resolution experts \non laws dealing with women, with a particular focus on their responsibilities, as well as on \ntechniques and skills required to respond to female victims of violence and discrimination; (iii) \nconducting legal training for women leaders, youth groups, gender equality advocates, and CSOs; \n(iv) developing a compendium of case law relating to GBV (good practices) in English and local \nlanguages for judges and lawyers; (v) preparing a course and/or curriculum on women\u2019s rights \nand related laws and issues to be taught at law schools and judicial academies;  and (vi) \nconducting any other activity that is considered relevant within the scope of this TA and is needed \nin the participating country. \n \n17.  Output 2: Increased awareness of and support for women\u2019s legal literacy and \naccess to legal aid and services. This output includes (i) developing print, electronic, and social \nmedia campaigns in national and local languages on women\u2019s legal rights, as well as procedures \nand services available for accessing legal aid; (ii) developing simple and reader-friendly materials \non pro-women laws; (iii) sharing success stories about raising awareness and creating an \nenabling legal environment for women using nontraditional media like text messaging and short \nvideos; and (iv) mobilizing existing communities by raising the awareness of government officials, ", "5 \nreligious leaders, journalists, CSOs, students, youth groups, and other stakeholders using various \nmedia, including documentaries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). ADB will not finance any activity unless it receives \nno objection from the government of the relevant participating country. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.   ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and the Central and West Asia \nDepartment (CWRD), will be the executing agency for this TA. The partner government agencies \nof the TA will be the Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights in Pakistan; the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs in Afghanistan; and most likely the Committee of Women and Family Affairs \nunder the Government of Tajikistan. Relevant organizations or CSOs will be identified during \nproject implementation to serve as implementing partners. The OGC will be responsible for \nadministering and supervising the TA in general, including the engagement of consultants and \ncoordination  with  implementing  partners.  The  CWRD  will  facilitate  the  development  and \nadministration of the TA and provide expertise relating to the participating countries during \nimplementation. The OGC and CWRD will be jointly accountable for the delivery of the TA outputs. \nThe TA will be implemented from 2016 to 2019. \n \n20.  The TA will require the services of three national consultants for 20 person-months each \nto support implementation of the TA in the participating countries. The TA will also require an \ninternational consultant for 20 person-months. One additional national consultant will be hired in \nManila for 24 person-months on an intermittent basis to help implement and supervise the TA. \nThe consultants will be recruited using the individual selection method or through a consulting \nfirm following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).23 The procurement of all goods and equipment under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nLegal Literacy for Women, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n23 To reduce the administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged under output-based (lump-sum) contracts, where appropriate. \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA Project is Aligned with: \nImproved access to justice and social and other services for women in the participating countriesa \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2018     \nImproved legal  a.

Consultants under the regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will be \nselected in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). These terms of reference broadly describe \nconsultants\u2019 tasks in relation to the implementation of activities under the outputs. \n \n2.   Background. In light of widespread ignorance regarding women-related laws and policies, \nthis TA aims to build a stronger and more inclusive society by (i) strengthening the capacity of \ninvestigating,  prosecuting,  and  decision-making  bodies;  and  (ii)  informing  women  more \nthoroughly of their rights to help them access social and legal justice. Legal tools have proven \nvery useful for facilitating social change, empowering women, and supporting better governance. \nLegislative reforms ensuring legal equality and protection for women have been introduced in all \nparticipating countries. However, women\u2019s literacy is very low and women\u2019s legal literacy is even \nlower. Furthermore, the legal and judicial systems have a fluid attitude regarding legislation and \nthe implementation and interpretation of laws in courts. To allow women to benefit from these \nlaws, it is important to work closely with law enforcement bodies to ensure understanding and \nproper use of the existing legislative framework. Improving women\u2019s access to and ability to use \nlegal  tools,  including  mediation,  will  facilitate  more  effective  and  substantive  gender \nmainstreaming of ADB investments in every sector. \n \nA.
