INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following a request from the Government of Nepal for capacity development technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to build the capacity of government \ninstitutions for waste management, ADB\u2019s country programming mission in April 2010 made a \nprovision for the Capacity Building for Waste Management TA.1 The country operations and \nTPF FPT\nbusiness plan (COBP) 2011\u20132013 reconfirmed the processing of this TA.2\nTPF FPT \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission visited Nepal from 8 to 12 July 2010. This report is based \non the understanding reached with the government during the mission regarding the impact, \noutcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  outline \nterms of reference for the TA.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nTPF FPT\n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Urbanization  and  waste  management.  In  2001  Nepal's  urban  population  was  a \nrelatively  low  14%  of  the  total  population,  covering  58  municipalities.  However,  internal \nmigration into urban areas is increasing rapidly and the urban population is expected to reach \n24% by 2016. While productivity in urban areas is higher and poverty substantially lower, \ninfrastructure  development  and  service  delivery  have  fallen  behind  in  urban  areas.  Public \ninvestments  have  not  kept  pace  with  the  growth  of  the  urban  population,  and  urban \nenvironmental conditions, already deteriorating, have worsened. Solid waste management is no \nexception, particularly in large urban centers, as the problem of uncollected or improperly \ndumped waste has also worsened. This problem is particularly acute outside of the Kathmandu \nValley, where only 24.1% of households had access to garbage collection and disposal systems \nas of 2003, compared with 83% in the Kathmandu Valley in the same year. 4\nTPF FPT \n \n4.  The role of municipalities is often limited to sweeping the streets and dumping the waste \non the nearest river bank or tract of open land. Modern waste management techniques such as \nsource-separated door-to-door collection, recycling facilities, and sanitary landfills have not yet \nbeen introduced in most municipalities. Municipalities generally lack the necessary skills or \nresources to manage the waste in a proper manner. Locating a sanitary landfill site is often \nchallenging, reflecting a \"not-in-my-backyard\" attitude in subject communities. In the Kathmandu \nValley, opposition from communities near landfill sites often blocks the transportation of waste, \nresulting in garbage piling up along the roadside. Besides being a nuisance, this poses serious \npublic health risks. Municipalities urgently need to introduce integrated waste management \nsystems, in partnership with local communities and the private sector.   \n \n5.  The potential to use solid waste as a resource and improve waste management systems \nin municipalities is high. However, efforts by municipalities to promote recycling have largely \nfailed. As about two-thirds of the waste generated in Nepal is organic, composting organic \nwaste could significantly reduce the cost and environmental impact of waste management and \nremove some of the pressure on landfills. However, to be sustainable, composting operations \nmust produce good quality, marketable compost. Nepal lacks quality standards for composting \nand poor management has forced many composting systems to stop operating. \n \n                                                 \n1  Formerly known as Capacity Building for Waste Management through Public-Private Partnerships.  \nTP2PT  ADB. 2010.

The Solid Waste Management and Resource \nMobilization  Center  (SWMRMC)  was  created  under  the  Solid  Waste  Management  and \nResource Mobilization Act (1987, amended in 1992) as an autonomous body under the Ministry \nof Local Development (MLD). Its functions include (i) undertaking basic construction, repair, and \nmaintenance work to control solid waste and obtain the cooperation of municipalities; (ii) making \narrangements for the disposal of solid waste in a pollution-free manner; (iii) making available \ntechnical  advice  and  other  assistance  for  any  individual  or  body  connected  with  the \nmanagement and control of solid waste; and (iv) providing or arranging to provide training in \nmatters concerning solid waste management and environmental sanitation. However, the act \ncame  into  force  only  in  the  Kathmandu,  Lalitpur,  and  Bhaktapur  municipalities  (all  in  the \nKathmandu Valley), and does not cover other municipalities. In accordance with the functions \ngranted, the SWMRMC is managing transportation and disposal of waste at a landfill in the \nKathmandu Valley. The Local Self Governance Act (1999), which assigns municipalities the role \nof carrying out and managing the collection, transportation, and disposal of solid waste, makes \nthe SWMRMC's role unclear even as it continues to manage waste in the Kathmandu Valley. \nThe  current  support  provided  to  municipalities  outside  the  Kathmandu  Valley  includes \nundertaking environmental impact assessment studies for new landfill sites, organizing training \nprograms for municipal staff, and providing a portion of land acquisition costs for new landfill \nsites. However, assistance is ad-hoc rather than systematic, and has not led to improvements \non the ground.  \n \n7.  Taking into account the circumstances described above\u2014in particular the urgent need to \nreformulate and strengthen institutional arrangements for improving solid waste management in \nthe country\u2014the government, led by the MLD, has drafted a new Solid Waste Management Act. \nThis new act defines the roles and responsibilities of local bodies, redefines the role of the \nSWMRMC, establishes a Solid Waste Management Council (SWMC), and includes provisions \nfor collecting service charges and involving the private sector in solid waste management. The \nSWMRMC will be renamed the Solid Waste Management Technical Support Center (SWMTSC). \nThe center will focus on supporting municipalities' solid waste management efforts and will not \ndirectly  undertake  solid  waste  management  operations.  The  SWMC,  to  be  chaired  by  the \nMinister of Local Development, will be responsible for formulating policy pertaining to solid \nwaste management. The Solid Waste Management Act has already been proposed to the \nParliament, and deliberation at the legislative subcommittee was completed in July 2010. As \nADB  has  approved  the  Secondary  Towns  Integrated  Urban  Environmental  Improvement \nProject,5 which includes components to improve solid waste management systems in Birgunj \nTPF FPT\nand Butwal municipalities, strengthening the policy and institutional framework and technical \ncapacity of the support agency (SWMTSC) will complement ADB\u2019s intervention at the project \nlevel. The TA will also build on the findings from an ongoing regional TA that focuses on \ninnovations in scaling up organic waste management.6\nTPF FPT \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2010.

Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be effective and efficient services provided to municipalities by \nthe SWMC and SWMTSC. This will be measured by the number of municipalities that initiate \nimprovement  of  solid  waste  management  utilizing  the  newly  established  regulatory  and \ninstitutional  framework\u2014including  support  from  the  SWMTSC  or  solid  waste  management \npolicies  and/or  regulations  issued  by  the  government.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be \nstrengthened capacity of the SWMC and SWMTSC under the well-defined policy, regulatory \nand  institutional  framework.  Indicators  will  include  the  number  of  regulations,  guidelines, \nstandards,  etc.,  issued  by  the  government,  through  adequate  consultations  with  relevant \nstakeholders  and  the  number  of  municipalities  seeking  and  obtaining  support  from  the \nSWMTSC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Component 1: Supporting the establishment of an effective framework for solid \nwaste management. Under the overall direction defined in the Solid Waste Management Act, \nthis component will support the establishment of an effective national solid waste management \npolicy  and  institutional  framework.  In  accordance  with  the  act,  a  national  solid  waste \nmanagement policy and strategy will be drafted. The act will define new roles and functions for \nthe SWMTSC (currently the SWMRMC) and SWMC, based on which regulations and a suitable \norganizational structure for the SWMC and the SWMTSC will be proposed. The regulations and \npolicy  will  address  the  formation  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPP)  in  solid  waste \nmanagement.  \n \n10.  Component 2: Strengthening the technical capacity of the SWMC and SWMTSC. \nThis component will strengthen the capacity of government officials\u2014mainly in the SWMC and \nthe SWMTSC\u2014to work within the organizational structure defined in component 1. The capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  cover  policy  and  strategy  implementation;  planning,  designing, \nimplementing, and operating an integrated solid waste management system, including sanitary \nlandfill; promotion of 3R (reduce, reuse, and recycle); technical issues such as landfill design, \nleachate  treatment,  and  organic  composting;  developing  proposals  eligible  for  the  clean \ndevelopment mechanism; and designing PPP contracts. A few pilot cases of collaboration \nbetween the SWMC and/or SWMTSC and municipalities will be supported in order to equip staff \nwith  hands-on  skills  and  knowledge.7  Such  support  may  include  development  of  project \nTPF FPT\nproposals,  drafting  of  institutional  arrangements,  or  facilitating  the  implementation  of \narrangements agreed upon among relevant parties.  \n \n11.  Component  3:  Supporting  the  development  of  relevant  regulations,  standards \nand/or guidelines for improving solid waste management at the regional and local levels. \nExisting rules and regulations do not enable municipalities to implement effective solid waste \nmanagement programs (although the situation should improve with the expected passage of the \nSolid Waste Management Act in September 2010). This component will support the government \nto first identify missing or ineffective regulations and guidelines, and then to fix them or draft \nnew ones. The work will involve close cooperation among all government agencies that play a \n                                                 \n7  The government requested that ADB support a pilot case in which public\u2013private partnerships will be used to \nTP PT\nfinalize contract arrangements and monitor agreed-upon arrangements for integrated solid waste management in \nthe Kathmandu Valley. This government initiative is ongoing, and the proposals from the short-listed firms were \ndue on 26 July 2010. \n ", "4   \nrole in solid waste management to ensure necessary buy-in and effective implementation. \nPotential areas of support will include: national tariff guidelines (including methodology for tariff \nsetting, collection, and administration); specific legal arrangements for PPP; health care waste \nmanagement  regulations;  design  standards  for  sanitary  landfill;  and  standards  for  organic \ncompost quality.  \n \n12.   Assumptions  and  risks.  As  mentioned,  it  is  expected  that  the  draft  Solid  Waste \nManagement Act, which is being deliberated in the Parliament, will be approved in September \n2010. However, the Parliament could end up amending the act and/or delaying its approval. \nWhile the MLD has assured that the act will be approved promptly and without any major \nchanges, consultants will be mobilized only after the act has been approved. If the need arises, \nthe scope of the consulting services will be adjusted. Improving solid waste management hinges \non effective coordination among various ministries and departments, as it involves not only \nmunicipal (domestic) solid waste but also health care waste and industrial waste, which are \nunder the jurisdiction of other ministries. Coordination with other ministries will be enhanced \nthrough the steering committee (para. 14).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  It is estimated that the TA will cost $600,000 equivalent. The government has requested \nthat ADB finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will finance the balance of the \ncost, equivalent to $100,000, through the provision of office space, remuneration for counterpart \nstaff (including their field per-diem and transportation), and other in-kind contributions (Appendix \n2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The MLD will be the executing agency and will appoint a TA director at the level of joint \nsecretary or undersecretary who will take the lead in supervising all tasks performed by the \nconsultants and coordinating the activities of relevant organizations. At the central level, a \nsteering  committee  will  be  established  to  monitor  implementation  of  the  TA.  The  steering \ncommittee, which will be chaired by the secretary (municipal management) of the MLD, will be \ncomposed of high-level representatives from the National Planning Commission, the Ministry of \nFinance, the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry \nof  Health  and  Population,  and  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  plus  the  general  manager  of  the \nSWMTSC. The TA director will work as member and the convener of the steering committee. \nThe steering committee will meet at least quarterly to discuss overall progress of the TA, \nstrengthen interministerial coordination, and provide policy guidance for TA implementation.  \n \n15.   The government will provide (i) any relevant documents, data, statistics, information, or \nmaps that the government has at its disposal; (ii) qualified counterpart staff (at least one staff \neach from the SWMTSC to respective fields of consultants\u2019 expertise), and their field per diem \nand field transportation; (iii) a TA director from the MLD, to be assigned before the mobilization \nof consultants; (iv) office accommodation and office equipment, including desks, chairs, local \ncommunication, and utility costs (electricity and water); and (v) logistical assistance for the \nworkshops  and  seminars,  including  venue  provision  and  identifying  and  sending  invites  to \nparticipants.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, from January 2011 to April 2012. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. International expertise (9 person-\n ", "  5\nmonths) will be obtained in the areas of solid waste management policy and PPP. National \nconsultants (31 person-months) will have expertise in the fields of solid waste management \nengineering, institutional development, financial management, social development, and legal \nmatters.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n   \n17.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A team of consultants will be recruited under \none package using the quality- and cost-based method of selection with a standard quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20. A simplified technical proposal will be used for the selection of the consultant firm.  \nIn addition, a few individual consultants may be engaged through the individual consultant \nselection method to address specific needs of the TA. Some equipment, such as computers and \nprinters, will be procured using the shopping method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  equipment\u2014including  software\u2014\npurchased under the TA will be handed over to the MLD or SWMTSC after the completion of the \nTA. ADB will undertake a TA review, in collaboration with the MLD, at least twice a year during \nimplementation of the TA. \n \n18.  The consultants will assist the government in organizing workshops at the beginning and \ntoward the completion of the TA. In the initial workshop, the framework, approach, objectives, \nand targets of the TA will be shared with participants from government agencies, development \npartners,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  Seminars  and  consultation \nworkshops will be held as needed during implementation of the TA to solicit the views of \nstakeholders in drafting policies, strategies, regulations, guidelines, and standards. The final \nworkshop will review good practices and lessons learned during the implementation of the TA. \nThe consultants will ensure coordination with related loans and TAs of ADB8 and programs of \nTPF FPT\nother  development  partners\u2014including  those  by  the  United  Nations  Human  Settlements \nProgram (UN-HABITAT) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships for the Urban Environment\u2014to maximize complementarities and avoid \nduplication. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Capacity Building for Waste Management, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n8  This includes the ongoing capacity development TA for the Institutional Strengthening of Municipalities and the \nTP PT\nSecondary Towns Integrated Urban Environmental Improvement Project (footnote 5).
