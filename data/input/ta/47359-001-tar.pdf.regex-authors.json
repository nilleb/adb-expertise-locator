INTRODUCTION \n1.  A  key  aspect  of  effective  development  management  is  the  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  a  national  development  strategy.  For  Solomon  Islands,  this  is  doubly \nimportant because development challenges are daunting and priorities must be set. In 2010, the \ngovernment approved the National Development Strategy, 2010\u20132020 (NDS), which is the first \nlong-term development strategy adopted by Solomon Islands. The NDS was the product of \nnationwide consultations and has enjoyed the support of the successor government since its \nadoption.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  NDS1 and  follow-up  support  for  reforming  the  planning  process.2 The \nGovernment of Solomon Islands has requested TA to further strengthen implementation of the \nNDS.   \n \n2.  The proposed TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for \nSolomon Islands,3 and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014 and Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020.4 A fact-finding mission was fielded in Honiara from 25 August to 1 \nSeptember  2014.  The  government  concurs  with  the  TA  project\u2019s  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since the approval of the NDS, the government has introduced a number of reforms to \ndevelopment planning including (i) a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework and function \nwithin the Ministry for Development Planning and Aid Coordination (MDPAC); and (ii) a new \nplanning  process  and  templates  for  development  programs  with  project  rationale,  logical \nframeworks, procurement plans in Solomon Islands government format, and implementation \narrangements. Under the NDS, individual development programs are combined in a medium- \nterm development plan (MTDP), a 5-year rolling plan aligned to the objectives of the NDS, in the \ncontext  of  agreed  medium-term  development  priorities.  The  programs  are  the  basis  for \ndevelopment budget bids, and the MTDP provides a context in which bids can be appraised and \nconsidered for inclusion in the development budget. The MTDP, the first of which was produced \nin August 2013, allowed development budgets to be appropriated in the chart of accounts for \nthe first time. This allowed development budget disbursements from January, rather than in May \nor June under the old system. \n \n4.  The  government  has  also  introduced  significant  budget  reforms  since  2011.  These \ninclude  new  financial  management  information  systems,  a  new  chart  of  accounts,  revised \nfinancial instructions, and a new dedicated procurement unit within the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury.  On  1  January  2014,  the  new  Public  Financial  Management  (PFM)  Act  became \neffective as a major step in the reform process. These budget reforms and MTDP processes \ncreate a core database for budget preparation and medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) \nexpenditure analysis. The first MTEF was produced in January 2014. The government has \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nestablished the key elements of a new planning and budgeting system, which has significantly \nenhanced the planning and budgeting capacity of government agencies. \n \n5.  Despite progress in improving development planning and budget processes, this work \nremains at an early stage and further assistance is required to maintain the reform momentum. \nThe PFM Act requires further regulation to support the MTDP and its implementation, including \nregulations to give effect to the PFM Act requirement for the preparation of an MTDP by \nSeptember each year. Coordination between the recurrent and development budgets, which are \nboth prepared on a cash basis, remains poor as noted by the Solomon Islands Forum Compact \nPeer Review Report.5   \n \n6.  Multi-year  budget  estimates  are  at  an  early  stage  and  there  is  limited  capacity  to \nproduce the MTEF and link it to the budget documents. The MDPAC\u2019s corporate structure is \nalso ill-suited to NDS implementation, with coordination between development planning, aid \nmanagement, and M&E remaining poor. \n \n7.  In June 2014, the government published the PFM Reform Roadmap for July 2014\u2013June \n2017 \"to draw all relevant actions to strengthen PFM into a single document\u201d. The road map \n\u201cgroups the actions together under common themes which crystallizes \u2026 focus not only on \nspecific actions but also on the priority areas that need to be addressed.\"6 Each of these themes \nis presented in matrix form.7 The activities are to be led by the MDPAC with the Budget Division \nof the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to integrate the preparation, monitoring, and reporting of \nthe separate recurrent and development budgets. The MTDP will be linked with the fiscal and \nbudget strategies and will become the central multi-year planning document linked closely with \nthe MTEF.   \n \n8.  To fully realize this model, the government has asked for assistance to (i) develop and \nimplement  regulations  giving  effect  to  the  planning  provisions  of  the  PFM  Act;  (ii)  further \nintegrate  the  recurrent  and  development  budgets  through  the  introduction  of  new  budget \nprocesses; (iii) strengthen multi-year budget projections; and (iv) improve coordination between \naid management, M&E, and development planning in the MDPAC. The government has set out \na clear, prioritized road map, which will be led by the MDPAC and follows the planning and \nbudget work of the previous TA. \n \n9.  The TA will begin at a pivotal time for Solomon Islands, with elections scheduled for \nNovember 2014 and the government facing strong budgetary pressures from the effects of \nflooding in April and the expected decline of the logging industry. Support for development \nplanning reflects ADB\u2019s strong relationship with Solomon Islands, and is coordinated with ADB\u2019s \nprogram grants and membership of the Core Economic Working Group.  \n \n10.  In  preparing  the  TA,  it  is  assumed  that  there  is  firm  government  commitment  to \nimplement the NDS. All governments have strongly supported the NDS since it was approved in \n2010. The main risks are that political instability as a result of the election could lessen the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to improved development planning and NDS implementation, or an \neconomic crisis could place added demands on budget allocations and change the focus of \n                                                \n5 Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2014.

The  flooding  from  Cyclone  Ita  in  April  2014  has  strained  budget \nallocations but has not changed the focus of government spending. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the proposed TA will be improved policy and strategy implementation. The \noutcome will be improved public expenditure management, planning, and reporting. The impact \nindicators are based on the M&E framework of the NDS. The target is that 60% of the indicators \nin the NDS M&E framework are rated successful by 2020. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA aims to support the government in implementing a long-term strategic vision for \nachieving higher sustainable growth. The TA will help translate this vision into results-oriented \nobjectives and targets within an MTEF, annual budgets, and MTDPs. The TA will also improve \nstrategic development planning capacity, and integration of the recurrent and development \nbudgets.  \n \n13.  The main TA activities are grouped into four outputs.  \n \n14.  Output  1: Regulations  giving  effect  to  planning  provisions  of  the  new  Public \nFinancial Management Act developed and implemented. Regulations supporting the MTDP \nwill be developed and there will be capacity building for annual preparation of MTDP.   \n15.  Output 2: Integration of the recurrent and development budgets improved. The \nbudget process for both recurrent and development budgets will be reviewed to strengthen \ncoordination.  Capacity building  of  MDPAC  staff  will  support  joint consultation  and midyear \nbudget review as well as capacity strengthening of line ministry staff to prepare estimates of \nrecurrent costs of development projects. \n16.  Output 3: Multi-year budget projections strengthened. The MDPAC and the Ministry \nof Finance and Treasury staff will be coached in the annual production of the MTEF. The current \nformat and processes for annual production of the MTEF will be simplified. \n17.  Output 4: Coordination between aid management, monitoring and evaluation, and \ndevelopment planning in the Ministry for Development Planning and Aid Coordination \nimproved. The corporate structure of the MDPAC will be reviewed to improve coordination \nbetween the aid management, M&E, and development planning functions in the ministry. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).  \n \n19.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff salaries, \noffice accommodation and transport, support services, venues and audiovisual equipment for \ntraining  workshops,  facilitation  of  consultations,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The MDPAC will be the executing agency and the implementing agency. ADB will be \nresponsible for consulting services, and will manage all TA inputs.    \n \n21.  The TA will require an estimated 20 person-months of international consulting services \nand 12 person-months of national consulting services. These will include (i) a senior planning \neconomist and team leader (international, 13 person-months), (ii) a public finance economist \n(international, 7 person-months), and (iii) a planning specialist (national, 12 person-months). \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the \nTA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010 as \namended from time to time). Procurement will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased under the TA will be \nprocured through direct payment procedure to suppliers and turned over to government upon \ncompletion of TA activities. TA activities will be implemented over 27 months, from December \n2014 to February 2017. Training activities under the TA will be organized and coordinated by \nthe local planning specialist under the supervision of the team leader. The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The NDS task force, a government committee comprising all permanent secretaries and \nthe Governor of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, will be responsible for monitoring and \nevaluating the implementation of the NDS and this TA. Good practices and lessons will be \ndisseminated throughout the implementation of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  for  Strengthening  the  Implementation  of  the  National \nDevelopment Strategy, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance \nTargets and   \n  Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved policy and  60% of the indicators in  NDS M&E Framework  Strong government \nstrategy implementation  the NDS M&E    commitment to implement \nframework are rated  NDS \nsuccessful by 2020   \n(Baseline: 0% in 2012)  Risks \n   \nA crisis will put strain on \nbudget allocation and change \nfocus \n \nPolitical instability \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved public  PEFA assessment  PEFA assessment reports  Strong and timely support from \nexpenditure  score for policy-based  2016\u20132018  all stakeholders \nmanagement, planning,  budget improves to B     \nand reporting   by 2018 (Baseline: C in    Risks \n2012)  Political opposition to proposed \n  strategies and priorities \n   \nStaff movements and capacity \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
