INTRODUCTION \n1.  Capacity building technical assistance (TA) will prepare documents and studies enabling \nthe  double-tracking  component  of  the  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program1 (RSIP)  of  the \nGovernment of India (GOI) to register with the United Nations Framework on Climate Change \nConvention  (UNFCCC)  as  a  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  project.  The  TA  was \ndiscussed with the Ministry of Railways (MOR), the executing agency, during the consultation \nmission to discuss financing for RSIP on 13\u201317 December 20102. The MOR fully supported the \nimplementation of the innovative TA, as reflected in the aide memoire of the mission. In March \n2011, the TA team leader and a representative of the MOR met with the Climate Change \nDivision3 under  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  (MOEF)  to  discuss  additional \nrequirements by the Climate Change Division for CDM projects. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Transport accounts for 23% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion5 \nand is expected to be the most rapidly growing source over the next 30 years, especially in \ndeveloping countries. The sector accounts for 15% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \n(footnote 3). The developing world accounted for 35% of world transportation GHG emissions in \n2000 but is projected to account for 52%\u201363% by 2030.6 Efforts are therefore required to reduce \ncarbon dioxide and other GHG emissions through better transport planning and establishing \ncleaner methods of transport. A number of options exist, such as promoting vehicles using \ncleaner technology, better traffic-flow management, more efficient public transport systems, and \nshifting  to  cleaner modes  of transport.  Using options  that reduce  emissions  in  developing \ncountries can be rewarded through the CDM, which was established under the Kyoto Protocol.  \n \n3.  The  CDM  is  an  instrument  designed  to  foster  GHG-reduction  projects.  Under  this \nmechanism, reduced emissions earn certified emission reductions (CERs) that can be traded to \ngenerate  income for the  project  owners.  As  of  May  2011,  3,097  CDM  projects  had  been \nregistered, and 150 approved non-forestry CDM methodologies existed, of which 100 are large \nscale. The transport sector has not yet been able to play a major role in carbon finance for \nvarious  reasons,  such  as  methodological  complexity,  costly  data  requirements,  complex \nprocedures to access carbon finance, and a focus in many countries on promoting private \nvehicles and not on measures to reduce GHG emissions. \n \n4.  To qualify for the CDM, a project must meet certain requirements: \n(i)  It must show additionality, or that carbon emissions clearly will be reduced by the \nproject  in  comparison with  baseline  conditions. The  carbon  emissions  would \nhave occurred in the absence of the new CDM project. \n(ii)  The project must be economically viable only with the CDM. \n                                                \n1 RSIP includes double tracking of about 840 km and electrification of over 640 km of rail routes along high density \ncorridors in the states of Chhatisgarh, Orissa, Maharashtra and Karnataka \n2 GOI has requested ADB to provide financing for a part of the investment program under a Multi-trance Financing \nFacility (MFF).  \n3  The Climate Change Division under MOEF is the designated national agency for CDM projects in India. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2011. \n5  International Road Federation Policy Statement on Environment, 24 January 2011. \n6  L.

Berkeley, CA: Ernest Orlando Berkeley National \nLaboratory, Environmental Energy Technologies Division. (July). \n ", "2   \n(iii)  Emission reductions must be calculated as differences between the baseline \nemissions and emissions after project operation, taking leakage into account.7 \n(iv)  The  project  must  be  voluntary  and  contribute  to  sustainable  development \naccording to the criteria of the national climate change authority. \n(v)  The project must carry out proper stakeholder assessments, and the project \ndesign document (PDD) must be disclosed on the UNFCCC website for public \ncomment.  \n \n5.  Since ratifying the UNFCCC protocol in August 2002, India has emerged as the world \nleader in reducing GHG emissions by adopting CDMs, accounting for 22% of all CDM projects \nregistered with the UNFCCC. India therefore has immense potential for carbon trading and \ncould be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the mechanism. The Climate Change Division under \nthe MOEF therefore encourages applications for CDM projects. \n \n6.  Under a business-as-usual scenario, the share of GHG emitted in India by the transport \nsector is expected to increase to 29% by 2019. It is estimated that road transport carries 60% of \ntotal freight traffic and emits 90% of GHG emissions from  the transport sector. The rapid \nincrease in demand for freight transport is expected to drive demand for truck transport, which \ncauses road congestion, traffic accidents, and higher GHG emissions.  The need exists to \ndevelop transport modes other than trucks to help reduce GHG emissions. \n \n7.  An ADB study8 on CDM potential for railway transport projects in India, Bangladesh, and \nSri Lanka showed that double tracking of four rail lines under the investment program had high \npotential as a CDM project. The four rail lines proposed for double tracking are the (i) Daund\u2013\nGulbarga section (224 km), (ii) Sambalpur\u2013Titlagarh section (182 km), (iii) Raipur\u2013Titlagarh \nsection (203 km), and (iv) Hospet\u2013Tiniaghat section (229 km). \n \n8.  The investment program will increase the capacity of the existing rail network to handle \ntraffic  demand  necessary  to  sustain  the  country's  economic  growth  by  (i)  increasing  the \nutilization efficiency of the physical rail infrastructure through electrification and doubling rail \ntracks  on  critical  routes,  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  existing  infrastructure  usage  by \nintroducing modern signaling systems, and (iii) improving operational and financial efficiency \nthrough institutional reform, especially accounting reform. This will (i) reduce fuel consumption \nand enhance energy efficiency; (ii) reduce pollution and improve the environment, (iii) enhance \nrailway safety, enabling railway users to benefit from lower transport costs; (iv) increase line \ncapacity, benefitting consumers and producers of goods and services through the provision of \ntimely and efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; and (v) improve staff productivity. \n \n9.  The major opportunities or benefits from the investment program in CDM terms are \n(i)  an additional, substantial long-term finance source with a continuous inflow of \ncapital allowing improved operational sustainability for the project and improved \nprofitability  from  the  investment,  income  earned from  which  can  be  used  to \nstrengthen the benefits of switching to rail and thus ensuring or even intensifying \nthe potential of the project to facilitate modal shift; \n(ii)  clear  documentation  with  monitored  data  and  external  verification  of  climate \nchange benefits from project; \n                                                \n7  Leakage is defined as changes in emissions, either positive or negative, that occur outside the project boundary \nbut are induced by the project activities. For example, the reduced congestion created by a new urban mass transit \nproject can have a rebound effect of creating additional trips and thus emissions. \n8 ADB, 2010, CDM Potential of Rail Transport Projects in SATCs portfolio ", "  3 \n(iii)  a positive image adhering to the project because of its contribution to mitigating \nclimate change; and \n(iv)  considerable potential for multiplication effects encouraging comparable projects \nin the region. \n \n10.  Based on this, double tracking rail lines is considered to have high CDM potential, which \ncan substantially contribute to improving the financing and profitability of the project. A new \nmethodology needs to be developed to make the project applicable for the CDM. While this \ntakes time, project construction will also take time, allowing the two to progress in parallel. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The overall impact of the TA will be the creation of a new CDM opportunity for transport \nprojects in developing countries through the development of a new methodology for quantifying \ncarbon emission reductions and promoting sustainable transport modes. The indicator for this \nwill be the UNFCCC\u2019s approval of the methodology developed under the TA, which will then \nbecome a public document that can be used by other transport projects. \n \n12.  The key outcome of the TA will be the generation of CERs with the establishment of \nadequate capacity in the MOR to continue to generate CERs. The indicator will be the quantity \nof CERs generated and the successful implementation of project requirements through the \nMOR\u2019s participation during the last year of the TA. The performance target is to generate a \nminimum of 750,000 CERs annually9 of which half (325,000 CERs) is to be generated during \nthe first six months of RSIP operation in 2016.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  To deliver the outputs, the TA will carry out the following: \n(i)  develop a methodology to quantify reductions in carbon emissions under the \ndouble-tracking  component  of  the  investment  program  and  submit  it  to  the \nUNFCCC, followed up by necessary revisions and clarifications; \n(ii)  prepare, after UNFCCC approval of the methodology, a PDD showing how the \nmethodology will be applied to the investment program; \n(iii)  submit the PDD to the designated operational entity (DOE)10 for validation and \nprepare any revisions required by the DOE and the UNFCCC; \n(iv)  obtain  approval  from  the  designated  national  agency  (DNA),11 which  is  the \nClimate Change Division under the MOEF in India, by making presentations and \nfulfilling its other requirements; \n(v)  monitoring,  after  the  executive  board  of  the  UNFCCC  registers  the  double \ntracking component of RSIP as a CDM project, the emissions of the project for \nthe first 6 months or 1 year and submitting the results to the DOE for verification \nalong with any necessary revisions; \n                                                \n9  One CER is earned by avoiding 1 ton of carbon dioxide emissions. \n10 A DOE is an agency accredited by the CDM executive board to validate project proposals and verify that carbon \nemission reductions have taken place as planned in the project proposal. A list of accredited DOEs is on the \nUNFCCC website. \n11 A DNA is the national agency responsible for approving CDM projects in the country. A project must be approved \nby the DNA before being registered with the UNFCCC. \n ", "4   \n(vi)  generate, based on the first verified monitoring report, the first set of CERs for \ncarbon trading; and \n(vii)  simultaneously  build  the  capacity  of  the  MOR  by  (a)  building  its  technical \nexpertise, (b) developing a manual and information system to enable the smooth \nimplementation  of  the  CDM  project  after  the  MOR  takes  it  over,  and  (c) \nidentifying  and  purchasing  appropriate  equipment  for  measuring  carbon \nemissions. \n \n14.  ADB will engage an international consulting firm with wide international experience in \nCDM projects. The firm must have had direct responsibility for preparing a methodology and/or \nPDD for at least five CDM projects that are either registered or being validated or registered with \nUNFCCC. At least two of the projects must be under the transport sector. Their main task will be \nto carry out studies and prepare the documents required for the double tracking components of \nthe investment program to be registered as a CDM project and generate the first set of CERs. \n \n15.  The assumptions for the successful implementation of the TA are (i) the generation of \nthe type of data required for clearly quantifying carbon emission reductions and (ii) the existence \nof adequate justification points to prove the project\u2019s additionality in reducing carbon emissions. \n \n16.  Risks identified for the TA are (i) inability to collect the required data from the field \nbecause  site  conditions  are  difficult  or  the  cooperation  of  interviewees  is  lacking,  (ii)  the \nmethodology developed becoming inapplicable for the project because of developments or \nchanges in project site conditions, and (iii) high turn over of staff in the new CDM unit of MOR \nestablished under the TA resulting in inadequate performance of the unit. However, considering \nthe high potential of the investment program as a CDM project and strong support from the \nMOR, these risks are considered slight. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $300,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe Government of India will finance the remaining $75,000 equivalent. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The MOR will be the executing agency of the TA and will collaborate with Rail Vikas \nNigam Limited, the implementing agency for the investment program. The focal person in the \nMOR will work closely with the CDM consultants and be responsible for implementing CDM \nproject activities after the consultants complete their inputs with the issuance of the first set of \nCERs. All consultants under the TA will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be based in \nthe MOR office.  \n \n19.  The  TA  implementation  period  will  be  from  July  2011  to  December  2016.  An \ninternational consultancy firm will be mobilized by September 2011 and implement the TA until \nthe issuance of the first set of CERs, following the start of operations of the double tracked rail \nlines in 2015. Project construction is planned to start in 2011. Three experts will provide an \nestimated 11 person-months of consultancy (7 international and 4 national) intermittently over \nabout 5 years, as required to achieve CDM registration and build the capacity of the executing \nagency. The consultants will have technical expertise in developing CDM methodologies and ", "  5 \nprojects and be familiar with CDM procedures required by the UNFCCC. The outline terms of \nreference for individual experts in the consultancy firm are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The success of the TA will depend entirely on the performance of the consultancy firm in \nquantifying carbon emissions and identifying equipment for measuring carbon emissions and \ndeveloping the required manuals and software for the MOR. Risks exist at each stage of the \nCDM process, and the consultancy firm\u2019s timely generation of outputs will be crucial to the \nsuccess of the TA. For these reasons, and because this TA uniquely requires relatively few \nperson-months over a long period of time, determining selection criteria and firm recruitment will \nbe carried out in close consultation with and under advice from ADB\u2019s Central Operations \nServices  Office.12 Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  All reports prepared under the TA will be disclosed during TA implementation. After TA \nimplementation  is  completed,  a  TA  completion  report  will  be  compiled  and  made  publicly \navailable. A presentation will be conducted to share experiences and lessons. If warranted, a \npublication will be prepared to convey the knowledge and experience for replication in other \ntransport projects. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000.00 on a grant basis \nto the Government of India for Enhancing Readiness of the Railway Sector Investment Program \nas a Clean Development Mechanism Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                \n12 The Central Operations Services Office has agreed that this TA will require an innovative method of consultant \nrecruitment within existing ADB consultant recruitment options.

Introduction \n \n1.  A  study  on  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  potential  for  railway  transport \nprojects under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Transport and Communications Division of \nthe South Asia Department in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka showed that double tracking \nfour rail lines under ADB\u2019s Indian Railway Sector Investment Program is a project with high \npotential under the CDM. The four rail lines proposed for double tracking are the (i) Daund\u2013\nGulbarga section (224 kilometers [km]), (ii) Sambalpur\u2013Titlagarh section (182 km), (iii) Raipur\u2013\nTitlagarh section (203 km); and (iv) Hospet\u2013Tiniaghat section (229 km).  \n \n2.  Based  on  these findings,  capacity  building  technical  assistance  (TA) for  Enhancing \nReadiness of the Railway Sector Investment Program as a Clean Development Mechanism \nProject will be implemented starting in July 2011.1 The main objective of the TA is to prepare \ndocuments and studies that will enable the investment program to be registered as a CDM \nproject under the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) and \ninitiate the generation of the first set of certified emission reduction (CER) credits. \n \n3.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  July  2011  to  December  2016.  An \ninternational consulting firm will be required to supply one international CDM expert for 4.5 \nperson-months, one international CDM capacity building expert for 2.5 person-months, and one \nnational CDM expert for 4 person-months. \n \nB.  Objective of the Consultancy Services \n \n4.  The overall objectives of the consulting services are to accomplish all steps required for \nthe double tracking of four rail lines under the investment program to be registered as a CDM \nproject under the UNFCCC and, thereafter, support the project\u2019s earning its first set of CERs \nand CER revenue. In addition, the capacity of the MOR must be built so that it is able on its own \nto continue monitoring activities as required under the CDM. \n \n5.  The consultancy firm will have extensive international experience in CDM projects and \nhave been directly responsible for preparing a methodology and/or project design document \n(PDD) for at least five CDM projects that are registered or currently undergoing validation or \nregistration with the UNFCCC. At least two of those projects must have been in the transport \nsector. Two international experts and one national expert will be required. \n \nC.  Scope of Work \n6.
