INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting Viet Nam\u2019s power sector \nreform from the outset through six technical assistance (TA) projects.1 These have led to, \namong others, the promulgation of the Electricity Law in 20042 and the road map for developing \na  competitive  power  market  in  2006  outlining  three  phased  initiatives:  (i)  the  Viet  Nam \ncompetitive generation market (VCGM), which was established in July 2012; (ii) the Viet Nam \nwholesale electricity market (VWEM), which will be piloted by 2017 and fully operationalized by \n2019; and (iii) a Viet Nam competitive retail market to be operationalized in 2021.3   \n \n2.  Until recently, ADB\u2019s assistance focused on generation and transmission subsectors \nbecause of their urgent investment needs. During the same period, the World Bank provided \nseveral TA projects and policy loans for the first phase of the power sector reform for VCGM. In \nresponse to the growing importance of power sector reform, ADB has programmed policy-based \nloans for the second phase of the reform for VWEM through collaborative parallel financing with \nthe World Bank. ADB and the World Bank have programmed $1.2 billion ($600 million each) \nthrough three subprograms.4 The TA will prepare prior actions in the policy-based loan series in \nconsultation with the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) and other \ndevelopment partners. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rapid electricity demand growth requires large investment in power sector. Viet \nNam\u2019s economy has grown at an average rate of 6.1% per year, and gross domestic product \nper capita increased from $699 in 2005 to $2,052 in 2014. Average annual electricity demand \ngrowth was 12.1% during the same period. In 2014, the peak demand was 22.2 gigawatts (GW), \nand the total installed capacity was 34.1 GW. The generation mix is 46.1% hydropower, 21.6% \ngas, 28.6% coal, 3.4% oil, and 0.3% renewable energy. Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) and its \nsubsidiaries own 56% of the total installed capacity, while 19% is owned by other state energy \nutilities, 16% by independent power producers, and 9% by foreign investors on build\u2013operate\u2013\ntransfer (BOT) and import. The revised power development plan (PDP) VII projected electricity \ndemand growth at an average of 10.5% per year during 2016\u20132020, and 8.0% per year during \n2021\u20132030.6 To meet such demand, an annual investment of more than $6 billion is required \nduring 2011\u20132030. Nearly 70% of this investment is for generation facilities, 60% of which the \nprivate sector is expected to develop. Additional generation capacity required is about 24.0 GW \nduring 2016\u20132020 and 48.6 GW during 2021\u20132030 (footnote 6). \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1995.

Reform is needed to sustain investment in the power sector. Established in 1995 as \na state-owned vertically integrated utility, EVN has been the main operator and has rapidly \nexpanded the power system, reaching 98% electrification ratio in 2014, from less than 50% in \n1995. However, its financial burdens have significantly increased at the same time because \nelectricity tariffs are below cost and the company is heavily dependent on foreign debt.7 One \npower reform objective is, therefore, to attract new private sector investment and improve \nefficiency through a market system. To enable this, EVN has been restructured: (i) the National \nPower Transmission Corporation, the National Load Dispatch Center, and the Electric Power \nTrading  Company  (EPTC)  were  created  as  EVN  subsidiaries  in  2008;  (ii)  11  distribution \ncompanies of EVN were consolidated into five power corporations in 2010; and (iii) with the \nlaunching  of  the  VCGM,  EVN\u2019s  generation  function  was  separated  into  three  generation \ncorporations in 2012. On the government side, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam \n(ERAV) was created in 2005, followed by the General Directorate of Energy in 2012 within the \nMOIT. The government also initiated tariff reform in 2009, following the Electricity Law of 2004, \nto reflect changes in supply costs.8 \n \n5.  Viet Nam competitive generation market, launched in July 2012, was an initial \nmajor step for power market development. In the VCGM, a single buyer, EPTC, purchases \nall power from generators using a combination of the spot market price and a contract price, \ndetermined by the power purchase agreement (PPA) using contracts for differences9 based on \nan MOIT-issued standard PPA form in 2010.10 The EPTC provides power to power corporations \nunder the regulated bulk supply tariff, and corporations sell power to consumers based on the \nuniform retail tariffs. The VCGM\u2019s spot market is a mandatory cost-based pool market with day-\nahead bidding. After 3 years of operation, the VCGM has significantly contributed to providing \nmore  transparent  generation  pricing.  However,  about  50%  of  generation  capacity\u2014mainly \nowned  by  strategic multipurpose  hydropower  plants (SMHPs)  and  BOT generators\u2014is  not \ntraded directly in the VCGM because of their operational constraints.11 \n \n6.  Next major step is to prepare the Viet Nam wholesale electricity market for full \noperation in 2019. In the VWEM, power corporations and large consumers can buy power \ndirectly from generators through PPAs and the spot market, and wholesalers are allowed to \nenter the market, contract with generators, and sell power to the power corporations. Unlike in \nthe VCGM, BOT generators and SMHPs can participate in the VWEM directly or through their \ntraders.  The  National  Load  Dispatch  Center  will  be  transformed  to  a  system  and  market \noperator (SMO) and will manage the market under the VWEM in addition to its system operation \n                                                \n7  There is a mismatch between EVN\u2019s long-term assets and relatively short-term liabilities. Further, EVN\u2019s debt is \ndenominated in foreign currency, which causes significant losses when the dong is devalued.    \n8  Prime Minister Decision No. 21/2009/QD-TTg, 2009. EVN is permitted to revise the retail tariff due to changes in \nfuel cost, exchange rate fluctuations, and generation capacity charges when the changes do not exceed the 5% \nthreshold. An increase of more than 5% requires approval from the MOIT, Ministry of Finance, and Prime Minister. \nTransmission tariffs are calculated and charged separately by the National Power Transmission Corporation and \napproved by the MOIT.  \n9  Under contracts for differences, when the spot market price for electricity generated by generator is below the strike \nprice set out in the contract, the EPTC makes payments to the generator to make up the difference. However, \nwhen the market price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference to the EPTC. \n10 Appendix 2 in MOIT Circular 41/2010. The pricing provisions were replaced by Circulars 56 and 57 in 2014. \n11 SMHP and BOT generators are not allowed to participate in the spot market. In the case of SMHP generators, \nwater value is not appropriately calculated in a way that reflects the opportunity cost of using water in storage for \ngeneration. Incorrect water value can result in sub-optimal use of the hydro resources and higher thermal \ngeneration costs on average. In the case of BOT generators, their marginal costs are above the system marginal \nprice cap and their dispatch plans are determined by take-or-pay power purchase agreements. \n ", "  3 \nfunction.12 Transmission charges then need to be unbundled so power corporations\u2019 purchase \ncosts can be changed from the current bulk supply tariff to a blend of transmission charges and \ngeneration costs, through a combination of PPA price and spot market price. While this will \nimprove the transparency and efficiency of the market-based tariff setting, it will also increase \npower  corporations\u2019  financial  risks  during  the  initial  years.13 To  minimize  adverse  impacts, \nEPTC\u2019s existing contracts with power corporations will be centrally allocated to generators and \npower corporations to make each corporation\u2019s power purchase cost similar. These vesting \ncontracts will be reduced gradually so generators and corporations can voluntarily enter into \nnew  bilateral  contracts.  The  MOIT  issued  the  VWEM\u2019s  market  design  outlining  such \nmechanisms in July 2014 (conceptual design) and in August 2015 (detailed design).14  \n \n7.  The development of the competitive VWEM is policy area A of the policy matrix being \nprepared for policy-based loans, and supported by ADB and other development partners.15 For \nthis policy area, ADB is implementing two TA projects to advise the ERAV on VWEM design \nand support capacity building for new market participants, such as power corporations and SMO, \nto participate in the VWEM.16 ADB also published an assessment of power sector reforms in \nViet Nam in 2015.17 The World Bank is providing assistance for studies on VWEM market rules \nand  the  capacity  adequacy  mechanism;  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  has \nsupported the study on the VWEM detailed design; and the United States Department of State \nhas  nearly  completed  the  study  on  the  treatment  of  BOT  and  SMHPs  in  the  market. \nDevelopment partners\u2019 efforts are well coordinated through regular dialogue. \n \n8.  Developing  competitive  wholesale  electricity  market,  while  ensuring  long-term \nadequate electricity supply, is a key issue to address. Although significant progress was \nmade in preparing the VWEM market design and rules, VWEM operation-related challenges \nremain in transitioning contract arrangements from the VCGM to the VWEM, monitoring and \nsupervising the competitive VWEM market operation, and developing market regulations for \nmarket prudential requirements and tax treatments. At the same time, the mechanism to sustain \nnew  generation  capacity  investment  needs  to  be  established.  Currently,  new  generation \ncapacity is identified through the PDP process, and new investment is ensured through EVN or \nBOT  arrangements.  However,  with  the  introduction  of  the  VWEM,  this  centrally  planned \napproach  will  need  to gradually  change  to  a market-based  approach.  But  other  countries\u2019 \n                                                \n12 The SMO\u2019s market operation function includes selling and purchasing electricity, facilitating market settlements, \nand reconciling energy accounts and monetary accounts. SMO will also be required to perform load forecast, day-\nahead and hour-ahead scheduling, and calculation of water value for the hydropower plants. It is planned that SMO \nwill be a subsidiary company of EVN in the beginning and scheduled to be fully independent in the future.   \n13 Power corporations\u2019 revenues are determined by the amount of electricity sold, regulated uniform retail tariff, power \npurchase costs, and other operating costs. In the VWEM, their power purchase price will change from the current \nbulk supply tariff to wholesale market price, determined by PPAs and spot market, and therefore becomes more \nvolatile and riskier.  \n14 Prime Minister Decision No. 6463/2013/QD-BCT, 2014; Prime Minister Decision No. 8266/QD-BCT, 2015. \n15 The policy matrix is prepared for: A: developing a competitive VWEM, B: restructuring the power sector, C: \nreforming the electricity tariff, and D: improving the quality of supply and demand-side response. For other policy \nareas such as B, C, and D, their preparations have been relatively well progressed with the assistance from \ndevelopment partners. ADB has provided a TA to review transmission charges payable to the National Power \nTransmission Corporation in the context of power sector reform (TA 8302). World Bank is assisting studies on EVN \ngeneration corporations\u2019 equitization, new retail tariff structure, and demand-side response program roadmap. KfW \nis preparing new assistance for the procedures to enhance transparency of the process for determination of \nelectricity prices. \n16 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nexperiences show a wholesale electricity market alone cannot ensure long-term, adequate \nelectricity  supply,  especially  when  there  is  growing  demand  at  high  rates.  Therefore,  an \nadequate supply mechanism, compatible with the VWEM and suitable in the context of Viet \nNam\u2019s power sector reform, must be developed.18 If not, there will be a high risk of lacking or \ndelaying new investment, resulting in power shortages and excessive electricity prices. Existing \nassistance has identified but not sufficiently addressed this issue.19  \n \n9.  Against this backdrop, the TA will support policy area A by preparing guidelines, road \nmaps, and regulations for (i) a competitive market operation for contract arrangement and \nprudential requirements and (ii) a mechanism ensuring long-term adequate supply, which can \nreplace, improve, or complement the current mechanism through PDP and BOT.   \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA impact will be an adequate and reliable supply of power for socioeconomic \ndevelopment.20 The outcome will be an improved regulatory framework and policy actions for a \nreliable and competitive wholesale electricity market. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   The TA outputs will be (i) key policy actions and regulations for competitive power \nmarket operation and (ii) key policy actions and regulations to ensure long-term adequate \nelectricity supply.  \n \n12.   Output  1:  Key  policy  actions  and  regulations  for  competitive  power  market \noperation. The TA will assist ERAV, which is responsible for the power market, in (i) reviewing \nexisting VCGM contract arrangements in light of the full VWEM design and rules; (ii) developing \nthe VWEM\u2019s contract models and arrangements; (iii) reviewing the law and rules on prudential \nrequirements  and  tax  treatments,  and  updating  regulations  as  necessary;  (iv)  proposing \nappropriate  vesting  contract  allocation  mechanisms  for  the  full  VWEM;  (v)  developing \noperational guidelines for contract arrangement mechanisms, including contract auction, and \nupdating related decisions or circulars; and (vi) organizing training, workshops, and study tours. \n \n13.   Output  2:  Key  policy  actions  and  regulations  to  ensure  long-term  adequate \nelectricity supply. The TA will assist the General Directorate of Energy, which is responsible \nfor PDP and BOT, in (i) reviewing viable project financing models to develop greenfield projects; \n(ii) reviewing possible mechanisms to ensure long-term, adequate electricity supply, including \ncompetitive tendering within the PDP, various capacity mechanisms, and a combination of both; \n(iii)  developing  the  conceptual  design,  detailed  design,  and  implementation  plan  of  the \n                                                \n18 If the current PPAs continue for new BOT projects and greenfield investments in the form of a take-or-pay contract, \nnew investment through the VWEM will be jeopardized. However, if the PPAs for BOT projects are changed similar \nto the PPAs used in the power market in the form of contracts for differences, it will be difficult to attract foreign \ninvestment due to high market risks, which will deteriorate long-term supply security. Therefore it is critical to \nexplore new mechanisms to ensure adequate electricity supply compatible with the power market. \n19 The World Bank has completed the study on recommending the capacity-adequate mechanism for ERAV.  \n20 This is one of the general objectives of PDP VII (2011\u20132020). Electricity is used for commercial activities and \nindustrial processes, thereby contributing to economic development. Electricity also increases study time for \nchildren and leads to improved indoor air quality as a substitute for traditional biomass sources or kerosene, \nthereby improving health conditions. As such, electricity is essential for socioeconomic development. \n ", "  5 \nmechanism that maintains the electricity market\u2019s role in guiding system expansion and ensures \nlong-term adequate electricity supply; (iv) assessing the contingent liabilities assumed under \nvarious mechanisms and developing a framework to manage them; (v) setting up the model to \ndetermine  the  amount  to  be  procured  through  different  mechanisms  in  the  PDP  planning \nprocess; (vi) developing operational guidelines for such mechanisms, and updating related \ngovernmental decisions or circulars if required; and (vii) organizing training, workshops, and \nstudy tours. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart salaries, office space and supplies, access to \ninformation  and  data,  local  administration,  knowledge  generation,  monitoring  and  reporting \nservices,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOIT will be the TA executing agency, and the General Directorate of Energy and ERAV \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies.  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Energy  Division  and  Viet  Nam \nResident Mission will manage and administer the TA. Development partners\u2019 activities will be \ncoordinated closely and regularly.  \n \n16.  TA implementation will require 24 person-months of international consultants and 24 \nperson-months of national consultants. Consultants will be engaged through an international \nconsulting firm following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time) using  an output-based and lump-sum contract. Equipment will be  purchased \nfollowing ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and turned over \nto the executing agency upon completion of TA activities. The TA will be implemented from 1 \nMarch 2016 to 31 May 2019.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.
