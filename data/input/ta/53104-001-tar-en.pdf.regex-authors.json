INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Implementing Reforms for Growth and Competitiveness is a knowledge and support \ntechnical assistance (TA) that will help Timor-Leste to become more economically competitive. \nThe TA will support the corporatization of water and electricity services and help reduce the \ntransaction costs faced by private businesses. The TA is aligned with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority 6 on strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity and operationalizes ADB\u2019s commitment to implementing a differentiated approach in \nsmall island developing states and fragile and conflict-affected situations.1 The TA is included in \nADB\u2019s Timor-Leste country operations business plan, 2020\u20132022.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Growth slowdown. The 3-year moving average for non-oil gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth in Timor-Leste peaked at 10.4% in 2009 and has declined steadily since then. This \nslowdown is reflected in the slow pace of job creation and poverty reduction. In 2013, 59,000 \nadults (9.5% of the working age population) were formally employed by private businesses. While \naverage wages increased significantly during 2014\u20132017, formal employment has declined.3 As \na  result,  only  8.4%  of  working-age  adults  had  formal  private  sector  employment  in  2017. \nProspects for job creation and poverty reduction hinge on improved public sector efficiency and \nincreased private investment. \n \n3.  Government effectiveness. Timor-Leste has made excellent progress in state building \nand institutional development. It has established core institutions and expanded access to basic \nservices, including primary education, health care, and electricity. Assessments of government \neffectiveness  and  regulatory  quality  show  improvement,  but  the  overall  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of the public sector remains low.4 In-depth assessments of the government systems \nfor public financial management and public investment that were carried out in 2016 and 2019 \nalso identified significant weaknesses.5 \n \n4.   Institutional strengthening. The Program of the Eighth Constitutional Government, \n2018\u20132023 includes ambitious targets for growth and job creation through improved government \neffectiveness. Government reform efforts are organized under four main programs: (i) public \nadministration  reform,  which  is  coordinated  by  the  Ministry  of  Legislative  Reform  and \nParliamentary Affairs, (ii) fiscal and public financial management reform, which is coordinated by \nthe Ministry of Finance (iii) decentralization reform, which is coordinated by the Ministry of State \nAdministration, and (iv) legal and judicial reform, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Justice.  \n \n5.  Stimulating growth. Improved government effectiveness would stimulate growth. The \ngovernment is the major actor in the economy and public investment accounted for 80.3% of all \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila; \nADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 6: Strengthening Governance and Institutional Capacity, \n2019\u20132024. Manila \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 September 2019; ADB. \nForthcoming. Country Operations Business Plan: Timor-Leste, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n3  Government of Timor-Leste. 2018. Business Activity Survey of Timor-Leste, 2017. Dili \n4  In 2017, Timor-Leste was placed in the 15th percentile on the government effectiveness dimension of the Worldwide \nGovernance Indicators, and the 24th percentile for regulatory quality. Timor-Leste\u2019s scores on both dimensions show \nsome improvement since 2013 when it was ranked in the 9th percentile for government effectiveness and the 17th \npercentile for regulatory quality.   \n5  International Monetary Fund. Timor-Leste Public Investment Management Assessment, 2016. Unpublished; and \nWorld Bank. Timor-Leste PEFA Assessment 2018. Unpublished. \n ", "2 \ncapital formation during 2007\u20132017. It is estimated that $1.3 billion of new investment will be \nneeded to achieve universal access to sanitation and clean water.6 This includes investments in \nnew infrastructure for water capture and treatment, water distribution, sanitation and wastewater \ntreatment.  Limited capacity and inappropriate models for service delivery have reduced the \nefficiency of public investment. Implementing more appropriate service delivery models can help \nto improve the efficiency of public investment and asset utilization, thus contributing to growth. \n \n6.  Electricity and water services.  These services are currently managed as directorates \ngeneral of the Ministry of Public Works and use general government systems for human resource \nmanagement, planning, budgeting, and financial management. These systems are not well suited \nto the needs of a modern electricity or water utility. International experience has shown that \nrestructuring public utilities as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) can help to improve efficiency and \nservice quality.7 The government has committed to implementing a corporatization reform that \nwould transform the electricity and water utilities into SOEs. Implementation of this reform will \nbegin in 2020 and has excellent potential to improve asset management and service quality. \nHowever, ADB\u2019s analysis of SOE performance in island countries shows that much of the benefit \nof corporatization is contingent on implementing good corporate governance.8 \n \n7.  State owned enterprises. Timor-Leste\u2019s 2003 Public Enterprise Law provides a legal \nframework for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Reviews of this law and associated policies have \nidentified several key gaps.9 Responsibility for SOE supervision is divided between the Ministry \nof Finance, line ministries (which supervise SOEs within their area of competence), and the \nChamber of Accounts (which audits SOE accounts). Previous corporatization efforts failed to \ndeliver the expected benefits. Independent assessments of the SOEs that manage drug supply, \nairports, and public broadcasting found that they failed to comply with their own statutes, lacked \nautonomy, and remained highly dependent on government funding.10 These issues point to the \nchallenges  of  establishing  well-governed  and  effective  SOEs  in  Timor-Leste  and  highlight \npotential challenges with the planned corporatization of water and electricity services. ADB has \nshared  lessons  from  SOE  reform  in  the  Pacific  with  the  government  and  is  supporting \ndevelopment of a new SOE policy through a separate TA project.11  \n \n8.  National Commercial Bank. The Banco Nacional de Com\u00e9rcio de Timor-Leste (BNCTL) \nis a state-owned financial institution. It was initially established as a microfinance institution and \nwas restructured as a state-owned bank in 2011. ADB has been helping to address governance \nissues that emerged after the restructuring, including weak separation between the board of \ndirectors and management, and gaps in shareholder supervision. ADB helped prepare new \nbylaws for the bank that were approved in February 2019.12 Successful implementation of the \n \n6  Government of Timor-Leste. 2018.

Stimulating private investment. Capital formation by private businesses in Timor-Leste \naveraged 5.8% of non-oil GDP during 2013\u20132017 compared to an average of 16.1% in Brunei \nDarussalam, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand in \n2017.13 A range of factors contribute to low private investment, including the small domestic \nmarket, weak property rights, and difficulties in accessing  land, skilled labor, and credit.  It will \ntake time to address these constraints, but facilitating business formation and new investment \ncould yield immediate benefits. \n \n10.  Business registration. The Servi\u00e7o de Registo e Verifica\u00e7\u00e3o Empresarial (SERVE) was \nestablished  in  2012  as  a one-stop shop for  business  registration.  SERVE  administers the \nCommercial Companies Law, which was updated in 2017. These changes have resulted in \nimprovements in Timor-Leste\u2019s score on the starting a business dimension of the World Bank\u2019s \nDoing  Business  indicators.14 However,  business  registration  continues  to  use  paper-based \nsystems, which create opportunities for discretionary administrative actions and increase the risk \nof delays. SERVE is committed to implementation of an electronic company registry. However, \nsignificant work is needed before this reform can be implemented, including the review and \nupdating of existing business processes. \n \n11.  Private investment. The government has worked to improve the regulation, promotion, \nand facilitation of investment. TradeInvest Timor-Leste is the designated government agency for \nthe promotion and facilitation of investment by national and foreign investors. TradeInvest is \nresponsible for administering Timor-Leste\u2019s Private Investment Law, 2017,  and associated \nregulations.15 The law provides tax exemptions and other benefits to eligible investors, and \nmandates TradeInvest to help registered investors acquire all of the authorizations, permits, and \nregistrations that are required to implement a new investment. TradeInvest is still at an early stage \nin developing capacity for investment facilitation. More effective facilitation of new investments \ncould  increase  the  proportion  of  proposed  investments  that  are  implemented  by  helping \nbusinesses overcome administrative barriers and inefficiencies. Improved facilitation could also \nhelp the government to identify and resolve bottlenecks in business regulation. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) average non-oil GDP growth increased to \n7% per annum and; (ii) private investment increased by 10% per annum.16 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: the quality of public utilities and business regulation improved.17 \n \n13 World Bank. 2019. World Development Indicators 2019. Washington, DC. \n14 Timor-Leste\u2019s score for the starting a business indicator increased from 15.94 in 2005 to 89.41 in 2019.

Output  1:  Governance  of  public  utilities  and  state-owned  financial  services \nimproved. The TA will support the preparation, updating and implementation of work plans to \ntransform the Directorate General for Water and Sanitation and Electricidade de Timor-Leste into \nSOEs. If successful, this transformation will lead to improved asset management, and more \nefficient and responsive service delivery.  The TA will support business planning for the new SOEs, \nthe development of asset registers and balance sheets, analysis of SOE staffing and human \nresource needs, and development of corporate policies and other management tools. To ensure \neffective  coordination,  the  TA  will  help  the  government  to  prepare  and  regularly  update \ncorporatization work plans. The government is currently confirming the availability of state budget \nresources to support the corporatization and may also mobilize additional grant-financed TA from \nother development partners.18 The work plans will include support that is funded by non-ADB \nsources and will include capacity development for the new SOEs and the government institutions \nthat will be responsible for SOE supervision. Implementation of these work plans will be monitored \nby  transitional  \u2018installation  committees\u2019  that  the  government  is  establishing  to  coordinate \ncorporatization.   \n \n14.  The TA will provide follow-up capacity development support to the new corporate entities \nonce they have become operational. This will include development of corporate systems and \npolicies and training of key SOE personnel. The TA will also work with the government ministries \nthat are responsible for BNCTL and the new water and electricity SOEs. The TA will support \nimplementation of BNCTL\u2019s bylaws and development of improved governance norms including \nthe procedures for appointing board members, contracting community service obligations, and \nmonitoring SOE performance.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Transaction costs for private businesses reduced. The TA will review the \nCommercial Companies Law, 2017, and design and implement a work plan to improve business \nregistration. The immediate focus will be on eliminating unnecessary inefficiencies and delays. \nThe review will also map out a pathway to implementation of an electronic company registry and \nhelp identify resources to support this reform. The TA will support effective communication and \ndissemination of changes in business registration processes. It will also help TradeInvest to \nreview and update its business processes for investment promotion and investment facilitation. \n \n16.  The TA will build on advisory support that has been provided through ADB\u2019s TA on \ninfrastructure  management  and  the  commercial  transformation  of  BNCTL.19 Evaluation  of \nprevious TA support to Timor-Leste has highlighted that successful reform requires flexibility.20 \nThis is reflected in the indicative TA implementation period. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \n \n18 Potential providers of TA include the Government of Australia, the European Union, the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. \n19 ADB. 2014.
