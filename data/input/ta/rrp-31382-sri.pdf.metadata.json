RECOMMENDATION 40", "LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY\nBorrower Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\nThe Proposal (i)  A program cluster comprising two subprograms to\nsupport policy reforms for private sector develop-\nment.  Subprogram  I  will  be  implemented  during\n2000  to  2002  and  Subprogram  II  will    begin  in\n2003.\n(ii)  Two  loans  to  support  policy  reforms  under\nSubprogram I.\n(iii)  Technical assistance for Governance and Institu-\ntional Support for Private Sector Development.\nThe Program\nRationale If Sri Lanka is to meet its long-term economic goals and\ndevelopment  objectives  of  reducing  chronic  unemploy-\nment, raising standards of living, maintaining high levels of\nhuman development, and reducing poverty, the economy\nmust grow  on  a  sustained  basis  and  the  country must\nmove to a higher growth regime. To achieve these, the\ncountry must mobilize larger amounts of resources, raise\nfactor productivity, and move to a higher value-added and\nmore efficient production structure. Public resources can\nonly finance a part of these needs. Moreover, lessons from\npast protectionist and  interventionist policies indicate that\na high price must be paid for inefficiencies resulting from\nnonmarket-based  resource  allocation.  The  Government\nrecognizes that to meet its resource requirements, it needs\nto  rely  on  the  private  sector  while  developing  the\nappropriate  market  environment  to  promote  efficiency.\nSocial  welfare  programs  cannot  be  sustained  through\nbudget  deficits.  The  Government  will  have  to  more\nnarrowly focus and target such programs, while shifting\npart  of  the  responsibility  to  individuals  and  the  private\nsector.\nObjective and Scope The objective of the Private Sector Development Program\n(PSDP) is to facilitate private sector participation in the Sri\nLankan economy, and enhance the market environment to\npromote competition, and thereby generate higher levels\nof  savings  and  investments,  and  raise  efficiency  and\nproductivity  critical  to  higher  and  sustainable  economic\ngrowth and the reduction of poverty.\nTo  achieve  this  objective,  the  PSDP  aims  to  eliminate\nimpediments  to,  and  develop  opportunities  for,  greater\nprivate  sector  involvement.  Subprogram  I  of  the  PSDP\naims  to  develop  the  enabling  environment  for  private\nsector participation, strengthen regulatory and institutional", "iii\ncapacity,  improve  the  public-private  interface,  and\nundertake  preparatory  work  for  the  next  subprogram.\nSubprogram II will aim to liberalize the infrastructure and\nother  sectors  that  have  remained  under  closed  state\ncontrol and ownership, to open them up to private sector\nentry  and  participation.  The  remaining  policy  reform\nactions are intended to complete preparatory actions for\nreforms still to be accomplished.\nSubprogram I will have the following elements: (i) sustain\nand reinforce the Government\u2019s privatization and public\nenterprise reform program; (ii) facilitate private sector entry\nand  participation  in  infrastructure  development;  (iii)\nenhance  the  market  system  by  promoting  fair  market\ncompetition  and  the  appropriate  regulation  of  private\nsector  activity;  (iv)  increase  labor  market  mobility  while\nproviding adequate protection to workers; and (v) improve\nprivate sector access to finance.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category B. Environmental implications of the proposed\nAssessment policy  and  institutional  reforms  were  reviewed,  and\nenvironmental  interventions  have  been  incorporated  as\nrequired.\nThe ADB Loans\n           Amount and Terms Subprogram I of the PSDP will be supported by two loans\nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB): (i) $85 million\nequivalent from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and\n(ii) $15 million from the ordinary capital resources (OCR).\nThe ADF loan will have a repayment period of 24 years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  will  carry  an\ninterest rate of 1.0 percent during the grace period and\n1.5 percent thereafter. The OCR loan will carry the pool-\nbased variable lending rate applicable to ADB\u2019s US dollar\nloans  with  a  15-year  maturity  period,  a  3-year  grace\nperiod, a flat annual commitment charge of 0.75 percent\nand a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount.\nSubprogram II of the PSDP will be presented for Board\nconsideration, based on the progress of implementation of\nSubprogram I. Policy actions for Subprogram II are subject\nto revision depending upon ADB\u2019s reassessment of the\nmacroeconomic  environment,  lessons  learned  during\nSubprogram  I,  and  status  of  implementation  of  and\nreadiness of the Government to undertake the proposed\npolicy  reform  actions.  Two  loans  are  proposed:  (i)  $35\nmillion equivalent from ADF and (ii) $15 million from OCR,\nunder terms and conditions as prescribed by ADB and\napproved by the Board. Tranching is still to be determined.", "iv\nProgram Period and The loans for Subprogram I of the PSDP are expected to\nTranching be  utilized  within  25  months  from  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness and are proposed to be released in three\ntranches of (i) $25 million, (ii) $25 million, and (iii) $50\nmillion. The first tranche will be made available upon loan\neffectiveness.  The  second  and    third  tranches  will  be\nreleased  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  specified\nconditions indicated in the policy matrix.\n            Executing Agency and The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) will be the\n            Implementation Executing Agency for the PSDP and the National Planning\n            Arrangements Department of the MOFP will be the Implementing Agency.\nA  steering  committee  will  be  formed  chaired  by  the\nsecretary, MOFP, to coordinate policy decisions that may\nneed to be taken to pursue reforms under the PSDP. The\ncommittee,  which  will  meet  regularly  and  as  needed,\ncomprise  key  officials  from  concerned  ministries  and\nagencies, such as the Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Internal\nand  International  Commerce  and  Food,  infrastructure\nministries, Public Enterprises Reform Commission, Board\nof Investment, Bureau of Infrastructure Investment, Central\nBank of Sri Lanka, Securities and Exchange Commission,\nstate banks, insurance companies, and provident funds.\nThe  steering  committee  may  also  call  upon  affected\nsectors for consultations on  important issues that will have\na  bearing  on  the  PSDP,  such  as  the  labor  unions,\nemployers\u2019  federations,  nongovernment  organizations,\nexperts from academe, and the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n            Procurement and The proceeds of the loans for Subprogram I of the PSDP\n            Disbursement will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items\nproduced and procured in ADB member countries  (except\nitems specified in the negative list and imports financed by\nother bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government\nwill certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the\namount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loans\nfor the given period. ADB will retain the right to audit the\nutilization  of  proceeds  of  the  loans  and  to  verify  the\naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. To facilitate the\ntimely release of funds to meet adjustment costs, proceeds\nof  the  loans  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports\nincurred  within  180  days  prior  to  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness.\n            Counterpart Funds The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loans will\nbe used to meet program expenditures and related costs\nof  reforms  for  private  sector  development  and  to  help\nmaintain current levels of social expenditures.\nTechnical Assistance Technical assistance will be provided, at the request of the\nGovernment,  for  $1.9  million,  financed  from  the  Japan\nSpecial Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The\nTA\u2019s scope includes improving governance, particularly of", "v\nthe  concerned  Government  agencies  in  related  reform\nareas  of  the  PSDP;  providing  capacity  building  and\ninstitutional  development  support  to  newly  organized\nregulatory  authorities  that  will  oversee  private  sector\nactivity and be functionally responsible for private sector\ndevelopment;  and  helping  the  Government  implement\nspecified areas of reform. Parallel cofinancing of up to $1.0\nmillion  will  be  provided  by  the  Swedish  International\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency.\nRisks and Safeguards The most prominent risk is an escalation of the present\nconflict in the north and east of the country. This could\npotentially delay  the reform program of the Government.\nThere are clear manifestations of the Government\u2019s intent\nto seek an early and peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nGreater  powers  are  being  devolved  to  Tamil-majority\nregions.  Norwegian  assistance  is  being  mobilized  to\nattempt  a  peaceful  settlement  of  the  conflict.  The\nGovernment is similarly addressing relief and rehabilitation\nfor  the  affected  population  and  has  sought  ADB\nassistance. The Government is committed to protecting\nthe  current  levels  of  social  expenditure  from  budgetary\ncuts.\nThere is also a risk that a change in the composition of the\npresent  Government  could  result  in  a  policy  shift.\nHowever,  the  previous  change  in  Government  did  not\nsignificantly alter the broad macroeconomic and market\npolicy orientation. Furthermore, if a broad majority view\nemerges, the opportunity for bolder reform actions may\neven present itself.\nThe  other  risk  is  lack  of  political  will  to  carry  out  the\nreforms,  particularly  since  the  PSDP  covers  sensitive\nareas, such as reform of the labor market, privatization of\npublic enterprises, and restructuring of state banks. The\nGovernment has been successful in gradually overcoming\nresistance  in  these  areas.  This  is  evident  in  the  large\nnumber of privatizations in industry and the opening up of\nselected infrastructure sectors to both private and foreign\ninvestors. The Government is taking the next step with the\nPSDP  to  eliminate  remaining  impediments  to  private\nsector  development  and  bring  its  reform  program  to\nfruition.\nDelays may occur in the implementation of reforms due to\nlack  of  capacity.  The  Government  has  identified  areas\nwhere it will require assistance. The International Monetary\nFund has also made useful suggestions of where ADB\nassistance should be targeted to address the most critical\nneeds.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) proposed\nprogram cluster concept for the Private Sector Development Program (PSDP) in the Democratic\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, (ii) proposed loans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri\nLanka for the Private Sector Development Subprogram I, and (iii) proposed technical assistance\nfor Governance and Institutional Support for Private Sector Development.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1997, the Government of Sri Lanka asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for\nassistance with (i) public enterprise and industry sector policy reform, and (ii) capital market\ndevelopment. In response, ADB fielded a staff consultant in January 19981 and a follow-up\nconsultation mission2 in March 1998. Their findings indicated that the main impediment to\naccelerated growth in Sri Lanka is the country\u2019s incomplete transition to a competitive market\nsystem; this prevents the private sector from achieving its full potential. Accordingly, technical\nassistance (TA)3 was prepared to consider reforms of public enterprises, the industry sector,\nand capital market, to support the broader aim of facilitating and enhancing private sector\nparticipation in economic activity. The PSDP, which is consistent with both ADB\u2019s and the\nGovernment\u2019s medium-term strategies, aims to eliminate impediments to more extensive private\nsector  participation  in  the  economy;  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\nparticipation, particularly in infrastructure development; promote market-oriented policies; and\nfoster greater reliance on the use of market mechanisms. The PSDP builds on the gains already\nachieved from earlier reforms to strengthen the private sector\u2019s role in Sri Lanka. The TA was\ncompleted in March 2000.\n3. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka from 6 to 16 March 2000 and with the\nGovernment formulated the policy reform agenda for the PSDP. The Appraisal Mission4 reached\nagreement with the Government on the package of policy reforms that is to be supported by the\nADB loans, the use of the program cluster approach for the PSDP, the program structure, its\nsubcomponents and tranching conditions, the size and terms of the ADB loans for Subprogram I\nof the PSDP, and implementation arrangements. The program cluster approach will provide\nflexibility for PSDP implementation given the complexity and sensitiveness of various reform\nactions  to  be  undertaken  and  prevailing  uncertainties  owing  to  the  civil  conflict.  The\nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter and the policy matrix are contained in appendixes 1\nand 2.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n4. On the political front, the most important challenge facing the Government is finding a\nlasting solution to the civil conflict. The present Government has sought a fresh mandate on this\nplatform. The President was retained in office in December 1999 garnering 51 percent of the\nvotes. Expectations are that reforms in all key areas (political, economic, and structural) will be\n                                                          \n1 The consultant conducted a preliminary analysis for public enterprise and industrial sector reform.\n2 The Mission comprised R.M. Limjoco, Senior Capital Markets Specialist, and A. Pio, Economist.\n3  TA 3075: Private Sector Development Program, for $830,000, approved on 23 September 1998.\n4  The Mission comprised R. M. Limjoco, Mission Leader; C. S. Chung, Senior Environment Specialist; J. Daumas,\nCounsel; H. Du, Senior Programs Officer; and N. Sinsiri, Financial Analyst. A. Severens, Director\u2019s Advisor, US,\njoined as observer. T. Crouch, Manager, Financial Sector and Industry Division (West); J. Cooney, Resident\nRepresentative; and S. Chanmugam, Project Analyst of the Sri Lanka Resident Mission, and S. N. Oh, Economist,\nassisted the Mission in the field.", "2\npursued.  A  new  constitution  is  being  framed  with  a  view  to  sharing  political  power  and\nguaranteeing equal rights for all communities.\n5. On the economic front, despite a suboptimal environment, the Government is targeting\neconomic growth of 7-8 percent annually over the medium term. To achieve these growth\nlevels, the medium term strategy focuses on (i) pursuing private sector-led development; (ii)\naccelerating  modernization  of  infrastructure  facilities  through  private  investments;  (iii)\ndeveloping Sri Lanka as a regional hub following the signing of the Indo-Lanka Free Trade\nAgreement5  allowing Sri Lankan products access to the vast Indian market; (iv) ensuring\nadequate access to finance and promoting a globally competitive financial sector; (v) liberalizing\ninvestments by foreign investors in the financial sector; and (vi) reducing fiscal deficits and\nimproving public sector efficiency.\n6. The  Government  has  refocused  its  role  to  concentrate  on  areas  where  market\nmechanisms do not function effectively, such as, education, health, environment, rural and small\nsectors, social and cultural activities, and safety nets for the poor. Sri Lanka has achieved a\ncomparatively high level of human development owing in part to its socialist tradition. It rates\nhighest among South Asian countries in human development indicators.6 When a gender-\nrelated index is used, Sri Lanka comes out even better, indicating the absence of gender bias in\nthe access to development benefits. However, the country faces the challenge of maintaining\nand improving these levels without resorting to substantial budget outlays, which slow economic\ngrowth and shift the burden of repayment to future generations. In the future, the financing of\nsocial expenditure will become increasingly difficult as the demographic transition is expected to\nlead to a stable workforce and an  aging population. Only higher levels of economic growth and\nproductivity will allow Sri Lanka to provide adequate employment and generate the resources\nneeded  to  sustain  development  and  improve  standards  of  living.  The  Government  thus\nrecognizes  the  need  to  reform  social  delivery,  but  more  importantly,  to  attract  private\ninvestments to generate the required resources to meet socioeconomic needs.\n7. The Government has committed to raise the share of income of the poor from the\ncurrent 4 percent to 15 percent by 2010. Based on latest available estimates, between one fifth\nto one third of the population live below the poverty line, that is, one fifth if the lower poverty line\n(least cost diet) estimate of SLRs860 per person per month is used, and one third using the\nhigher poverty line (diet prevailing among poor households) estimated at SLRs1,032 per person\nper month.7 Poverty decreased between 1985/86 and 1997 from 45 percent to 31 percent using\nthe higher poverty line estimate. Poverty is predominantly a rural affliction in Sri Lanka with over\n85 percent of the poor situated in rural areas, working in agriculture and fisheries. Past welfare-\noriented poverty reduction strategies based mainly on handouts were replaced with employment\ncreation  and  income  generating  approaches  to  raise  the  income  of  low-income  families.\nHowever, in the 1990s, little progress has been achieved in reducing poverty. The Government\nrecently introduced the framework for the reduction of poverty that targets to reduce poverty in\nall its many dimensions, create opportunities for the poor, strengthen the social protection\nsystem,  and  empower  the  poor.  The  framework  was  prepared  over  two  years  with  wide\nparticipation by stakeholders, the Government, the academic community, technical experts, aid\nrepresentatives, and local and international nongovernment organizations. Workshops were\nheld in May 1998, February 1999, October 1999, and May 2000.\n                                                          \n5 Trade promotion agreement between India and Sri Lanka, whereby both countries agreed to eliminate and/or lower\ntariffs on selected items. The Government has requested  ADB assistance to operationalize this agreement.\n6 The index is a simple average of three indices: life expectancy, educational attainment, and adjusted per capita\ngross domestic product converted at purchasing power parity exchange rates.\n7 Central Bank of Sri Lanka estimates 1996/97.", "3\nB.  Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n8. The Sri Lankan economy has performed creditably over the last 20 years growing at a\n4.2 percent annual average rate in the 1980s, accelerating to 5.2 percent in the 1990s8 despite\nperiodic droughts and the long drawn-out civil conflict. After achieving real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth of 4.7 percent in 1998, economic growth slackened to 4.3 percent in\n1999, mainly due to declining industrial production and a fall in exports due to weak export\nmarkets.  After  a  slow  increase  of  3  percent  during  the  first  quarter  of  1999,  industrial\nperformance accelerated due to a gradual improvement in exports, particularly during the last\nquarter of the year. The agriculture sector also performed well with a higher output of plantation\ncrops.\n9. The ratio of national savings to GDP inched up from 23.4 percent to 23.9 percent in\n1999 because of higher private savings and a reduction in Government dissavings. However,\ndomestic investments reflected a larger increase from 25.1 percent to 27.1 percent chiefly due\nto the upgrading of SriLankan Airlines and expansion of telecommunications services, leading to\nan increase in the national savings-investment gap.\n10. The unemployment rate declined to 8.9 percent in 1999 from 9.5 percent the previous\nyear  as  a  result  of  increased  employment  in  tourism,  strong  growth  registered  by  small\nbusinesses, and higher recruitment by the public sector. Population grew at an annual rate of\n1.4 percent and reached approximately 19 million by the end of 1999.\n11. The budget deficit declined from 9.2 percent in 1998 to 7.5 percent in 1999, due to a rise\nin revenues and a reduction of expenditures. Government revenues rose from 17.2 percent to\n17.6 percent of GDP due to a sizeable improvement in collections from income taxes, excise\ntaxes, national security levy, and nontax revenue, while overall expenditures declined from 26.4\npercent of GDP in 1998 to 25.1 percent in 1999. The Government's defense expenditure\naveraged 3.3 percent of GDP annually during the first half of the 1990s. Following a breakdown\nin negotiations on settlement of the civil conflict in 1995, defense expenditure increased to an\naverage of 5.4 percent of GDP during the second half of the 1990s. It currently amounts to\nabout 5.1 percent of GDP owing partly to the intensification of conflict since April 2000. To\nfinance the additional expenditure on war efforts, the Government has raised the national\nsecurity  levy  and  excise  taxes  on  alcohol  and  tobacco,  and  reduced  nonessential  capital\nexpenditure by about 10 percent. Monetary policy was eased as inflation declined. Inflation\naveraged 4.7 percent in 1999 vis-\u00e0-vis 9.4 percent in 1998, due to the improved domestic\nsupply  of  food  items  and  lower  import  prices.  Broad  money,  comprising  currency  notes,\nchecking accounts, and fixed deposits, rose by 13.3 percent in 1999, and credit to the private\nsector rose by 12 percent.\n12. The trade deficit rose to $1.3 billion in 1999 from $1.1 billion in 1998 as exports fell 4.1\npercent in 1999 due to the effects of depressed global demand and decline of commodity\nprices, especially for tea, rubber, textile, and garments, while imports rose marginally at 0.2\npercent. The services account showed marginal improvement despite the increase in tourist\narrivals.\n                                                          \n8 However, growth was based primarily on growth of inputs rather than efficiency of the use of inputs. Ahmed, S. and\nRanjan, P. 1995. Policy Research Working Paper 1478: Promoting Growth in Sri Lanka. The World Bank,\nWashington DC, noted that the efficiency of investment in Sri Lanka is low as calculated over a 30 years (1960-\n1990) in terms of average return on capital of about 21 percent, compared with Republic of Korea with 33 percent,\nThailand with 31 percent, Malaysia with 27, percent and Indonesia with 26 percent. Estimates show that Sri Lanka\nexperienced negative total factor productivity over a substantial part of the 1970-1992 period.", "4\n13. The current account deficit widened to 3.1 percent of GDP in 1999. The overall balance\nof payments registered a deficit of $263 million from a surplus of $37 million the previous year.\nConsequently, gross official reserves declined to $1.6 billion (equivalent to about three months\nof imports) from $2.0 billion. The external debt to GDP ratio rose to 57.4 percent in 1999 from\n55.5 percent in 1998, and the debt service ratio increased from 13.3 percent to 15.2 percent.\nThe Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8.2 percent against the dollar during 1999.\n14. The outlook is favorable over the short term. The economy managed to grow by 7.0\npercent during the first half of 2000. Real GDP is expected to grow by 6 percent in both 2000\nand 2001. The growth is expected as a result of a modest recovery in industrial production\nassisted by the expected overall recovery in world trade. More rapid growth in power and\ntelecommunications will help boost the economy in ensuing years.\n15. The budget deficit is expected to widen to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2000 but narrow\nthereafter  due  to  revenue-enhancing  measures  and  rationalization  of  public  expenditures.\nDomestic borrowing is projected to be reduced from 6.7 percent of GDP in 1999 to 5.5 percent\nin 2000. The 2000 budget contains reform measures to relax restrictions on taxation and on\nforeign  holdings  in  the  banking  and  insurance  systems.  Inflation  is  forecast  at  an  annual\naverage of about 7.5 percent considering the likely impact of increasing oil prices. The external\ncurrent account deficit to GDP ratio is expected to widen to 7.9 percent in 2000 but decrease in\n2001.\nIV.  THE SECTOR\nA.  Background and Recent Performance\n16. Before 1977, the Government embarked on wide-ranging program to nationalize the Sri\nLankan economy. Under the Government Business Acquisition Act, basic industries, all utilities,\nand a major part of the banking system were taken over by the state. State control extended to\ntrade, and various limitations were placed on land and house ownership and bank credit.\nGovernment policy was shaped largely by overriding concerns about unemployment and by the\nsocialist  orientation  of  successive  public  administrations  after  independence.  Chronic\nunemployment has been a serious problem9 and has been exacerbated by high population\ngrowth. Concerns about unemployment plus a widening balance of payments deficit led to a\nbias for domestic production and to the adoption of an import substituting and inward-looking\npolicy. Fears that sufficient investments in industrial projects may not be forthcoming from the\nprivate sector to absorb new entrants into the labor force prompted extensive Government\nintervention in commercial activities. With a diminished role for the private sector and lack of\ncompetitive markets, the Government was compelled to cover up for any shortcomings leading\nto substantial employment creation in the public sector, stringent labor laws, expensive social\nprograms, and unsustainable fiscal costs.\n17. Aside from bloating the bureaucracy, the immediate impact of Government policy was to\ndiscourage domestic and foreign investments, dampen exports, and repress the financial sector.\nHeavy  Government  intervention  and  a  highly  regulated  economy  also  spawned  gross\ninefficiencies in the conduct of business activity.\n18. Poor economic performance and macroeconomic imbalances that followed prompted the\nGovernment, in 1977, to adopt a fundamental shift in policy to one that relies on market\n                                                          \n9 For several weeks in 1971, the country was paralyzed by riots arising from dissatisfaction, particularly among the\nyouth, over the high level of unemployment.", "5\nmechanisms and an export-led strategy. However, the change in policy was not accompanied\nby a diminution of the public sector\u2019s role in business. The public sector still accounted for the\nlion\u2019s share of real investment in the economy and public expenditures continued to soar,\naggravated by large public investments in infrastructure and security-related costs. Foreign debt\nand debt servicing requirements spiraled at a time when the country was experiencing weak\nexports  and  stagnating  overseas  remittances.  Consequently,  the  economy  continued  to\ndeteriorate. By 1986, the country had lost access to international financial markets.\n19. Subsequently, the Government initiated a new round of reforms tearing down tariff\nbarriers, eliminating import licensing for nonagricultural products, and devaluing the Sri Lankan\nrupee. The medium-term development strategy also accorded a more prominent role to the\nprivate sector and called for increasing deregulation of economic activity.\n20. The economy responded positively to the reforms. The private sector share of industry\nsector output expanded dramatically, from 45 percent in 1975 to 94 percent in 1999, and\nexports rose from 22 to 30 percent of GDP over the same period. The share of Government\nconsumption and investment declined from 16 percent of GDP in 1982 to about 12.1 percent by\n1999. The unemployment rate declined from a peak of about 24 percent in the 1970s to 8.9\npercent in 1999.\n21. After the initial sale of a public enterprise (PE) in 1989, the Government gradually\ndisengaged from commercial business operations; in 1995 it appointed a special Presidential\ntask force that led to the establishment of the Public Enterprises Reform Commission (PERC)\nthat is tasked with undertaking public enterprise reform. Nonetheless, the transition to an open,\ncompetitive market system remains far from complete. Policy and institutional vestiges of the\nimport-substituting era continue to impede private sector activity and the attainment of a higher\ngrowth regime by the country.\n22. In 1999 the private sector comprised about 36,000 registered private companies and\nabout 2,160 registered public companies; approximately 75 percent of these were small- and\nmedium-size companies. The private sector had a dominant foothold in major industries, such\nas food, beverage, textiles, wood, basic metal, nonmetallic products, fabricated metal products,\nmachinery  and  transport  equipment,  and  manufactured  products.  The  public  sector  led  in\nutilities and transport. Private sector investments increased from about 14.8 percent of GDP in\n1990 to approximately 20.5 percent in 1999, while public sector investment including public\nenterprises, declined from 8.4 percent to 6.6 percent of GDP during the same period. In 1999,\nthe private sector employed about 44 percent of the labor workforce, up from 35 percent in\n1990. Including the self-employed and unpaid family workers, the figure rises to 86 percent,\nwhich compares favorably with 78 percent in 1990.\nB.  Constraints and Issues\n1.  Privatization and Public Enterprise Reform\n23. After a slow start, the next phase of privatizations of public enterprises (1989-1994)\naccelerated in 1992 and with 42 public enterprises divested in diverse areas such as food,\ncement, textiles, hotels, motors, tires, and services, with total proceeds of SLRs12.2 billion\n(about $156 million). ADB supported the Government\u2019s privatization program under it\u2019s Financial\nSector  Program  loan  in  1990.10  ADB  directly  assisted  the  Government  with  successfully\n                                                          \n10Loan 1051 - SRI: Financial Sector Program, for $80 million, approved on 20 November 1990.", "6\nprivatizing  the  National  Development  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (NDB).11  The  Government  also\nprivatized bus transport by transferring 50 percent ownership to employees, introduced private\nsector management into state-owned plantations through short-term management contracts,\nand converted  Sri Lanka Telecom into a corporation. Since the establishment of PERC in\n199512 and until the end of 1999, 40 enterprises were sold, raising total proceeds of SLRs34.5\nbillion (approximately $442 million). Proceeds from privatizations were principally utilized to\nretire public debts. The reduction in debt service and the concomitant increase in market\nliquidity led to an easing of interest rates and improved private sector access to funds.\n24. The Government has accomplished major privatizations of plantations and firms in the\nmanufacturing sector. The sale of 35 percent of Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd (SLTL) to Nippon\nTelegraph and Telephone Company of Japan, and 26 percent of SriLankan Airlines to Emirates\n(the international airline of the United Arab Emirates) are considered major breakthroughs in\nboth private and foreign investments in the highly sensitive infrastructure sector.13 However, not\nall privatized enterprises have operated smoothly, several have failed. These failures, involving\nmass layoffs, nonpayment of wages, and other actions deemed detrimental to workers\u2019 interest,\nprompted the Government to reinvest seven affected companies. Three have been restructured\nand reprivatized.\n25.  By  the  end  of  1999,  150  public  institutions,  including  commercial  enterprises,\ndepartments,  statutory  boards,  and  agencies  were  still  wholly  owned  by  the  Government\nemploying about 181,000 people (around 3 percent of total employment) with a net asset value\nof close to SLRs295 billion ($3.8 billion).\n26.  Although the Government was able to reduce budgetary support for current expenditures\nto 75 institutions, totaling SLRs4.4 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) in 1997 (less than half the size of\nthe budgetary support to 100 enterprises in 1995 of about 1.5 percent of GDP), and the capital\ntransfers from SLRs18 billion to SLRs17 billion in the same period, both current and capital\ntransfers increased to SLRs6 billion and SLRs25 billion, respectively, in 1999. Several public\nenterprises also constitute liabilities to the Government. Other efforts to minimize Government\nbudgetary support include the adjustment of tariffs on electricity, postal service fees, water,\ntelecommunications, and petroleum.\n27. The  framework  of  corporate  governance  also  remains  weak  among  these  public\ninstitutions. Weak corporate governance is reflected in (i) lack of management autonomy and\ncommercial orientation, and absence of corporate vision; (ii) inflexibility in pricing of services; (iii)\npoor  procurement  practices;  and  (iv)  nontransparent  operations  owing  to  weak  disclosure\nstandards and enforcement as exemplified in the often delayed or failure in submitting audited\nannual reports. In April 1999, the Department of Public Finance reported that a number of\naudited accounts for public enterprises for 1996 were still outstanding, some of the 1997 reports\nand none of the1998 reports have been received.\n2.  Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure\n28. In 1993, the Government constituted the Secretariat for Infrastructure Development and\nInvestment, as part of the former Ministry of Planning and Plan Implementation, to promote\n                                                          \n11EI 7084: National Development Bank of Sri Lanka, for $1.62 million, approved on 21 April 1992.\n12The World Bank, commencing in May 1996 and through June 1999, provided support through an IDA loan to\nfinance  PERC\u2019s  operational  costs  comprising  consulting  services  and  marketing,  staff  training  and  office\nequipment. This assistance is part of a $15 million credit under the Telecommunications Regulation and Public\nEnterprise Technical Assistance Project.\n13Earlier attempts to privatize SLTL did not prosper because of trade union opposition.", "7\nprivate  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development.  Subsequently  in  1995,  the\nSecretariat\u2019s functions were transferred to the Bureau of Infrastructure Investment (BII). BII was\nestablished as a separate division of the Board of Investment (BOI) to facilitate foreign direct\ninvestment being channeled to infrastructure development. BII was mandated to support line\nministries and Government agencies in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, and implementing\nprivate sector infrastructure projects under build-own-operate (BOO) and build-operate-transfer\n(BOT) arrangements.\n29. BII  comprises  a  small  team  of  14  professionals  with  private  sector  experience,  in\naddition to advisers for the power and transport sectors. BII\u2019s contribution to BOO/BOT projects\nhas concentrated mainly on providing the financial and legal inputs needed for structuring,\nevaluating,  and  negotiating  projects.  Technical  inputs  are  typically  provided  by  the  line\nagencies. Only where such expertise cannot be provided by the line agencies has BII stepped in\nand  in  certain  cases  outsourced  such  requirements.  More  specifically,  BII  structures  and\nprepares  the  request  for  proposal  and  related  documentation  for  infrastructure  projects,\nundertakes the financial evaluation of project proposals, coordinates project inputs from the line\nagencies, leads the negotiation of project agreements with private developers on behalf of the\nGovernment in consultation with relevant ministries, agencies, and the attorney general, and\nprepares the Cabinet memorandum and other information memorandums required. However,\nBII\u2019s capacity is dependent upon the qualified and experienced private sector professionals that\nit is able to attract through competitive salaries on a two-to three-year contract basis. The ability\nof BII to retain their services is dependent on external funding support.14\n30. There have been considerable delays in processing BOO/BOT projects. Delays in the\nnegotiation of projects have been traced principally to (i) poor coordination between BII and line\nministries resulting in often late responses from ministries and line agencies; (ii) difficulty in\nconstituting project committees responsible for prequalifying proposals and evaluating request\nfor proposals for meetings, as this task has been assigned to senior officials of ministries and\nline  agencies  and  poses  an  additional  burden  to  their  day-to-day  functions;  (iii)  lack  of\nstandardized  procedures;  (iv)  lack  of  independent  regulatory  authorities  as  traditionally\nGovernment ministries and agencies act as both operator and regulator without clear guidelines\nfor the sector concerning BOO/BOT arrangements;15 and (v) absence of a medium-term sector\ndevelopment plan that identifies early areas to be earmarked for private sector investments.\n31. The projects that BII has completed or negotiated include the Sapugaskanda Diesel\nPower Plant for $62 million, the first independent power project undertaken on a BOO basis; a\nbarge-mounted power plant for $72 million to be moored at the Colombo port; a combined-cycle\npower plant for $120 million; and Colombo Port for the development of the Queen Elizabeth\nQuay for $240 million. Most projects required more than two years to reach closure. The World\nBank provided support to the Government in the form of the Private Sector Infrastructure\nDevelopment Company, which was incorporated in March 1995 to lend to eligible private sector\ninfrastructure projects in Sri Lanka.\n3.  Competition, Consumer Protection and Incentive Policies\n32. Regulatory agencies operating under the competition and consumer protection laws\ncomprise the Fair Trading Commission (FTC) and Department of Internal Trade, under the\nMinistry of Internal and International Commerce and Food.\n                                                          \n14Under its Promotion of Private Infrastructure project, the United States Agency for International Development\nfunded several key positions on a reducing scale at BII from 1996 to 1999.\n15The exception is telecommunications, where the Telecom Regulatory Commission has been set up. Recently the\ncommission's capacity was improved with World Bank assistance.", "8\n33. The Fair Trade Commission Act of 1987 and the 1990 amendments aim to regulate\nmonopolies and mergers, and investigate anticompetition practices. The Consumer Protection\nAct of 1979 empowered the Department of Internal Trade (DIT) to investigate practices that\nmight harm consumers. Essentially, these practices relate to the sale of articles, and include\nprice marking, packing, and labeling, standards and specifications, hoarding, price control, and\nmisrepresentation.\n34. FTC and DIT effectiveness is constrained by inadequate resources and weak capacity.\nThe FTC has an annual budget of SLRs5 million ($0.064million) and a staff budget for 21\npositions  only  12  have  been  filled.  The  professional  staff  include  the  chairperson,  two\neconomists, and two accountants. The DIT, on the other hand, has a staff budget for 200\npositions, only 120 have been filled. Most of the staff comprise inspectors in field branches and\nadministrative districts all over the country, who reportedly are poorly trained. As a result, there\nis  a  very  low  level  of  awareness  of  consumer  rights  and  of  the  obligations  of  market\npractitioners. Sri Lanka does not have an umbrella association of consumers.\n35. In 1995, the Ministry of Internal and International Commerce and Food (MIICF) task\nforce  was  organized  to  improve  implementation  of  the  country\u2019s  competition  policy  and\nconsumer protection laws. A bill to create a single agency, a consumer protection authority\n(CPA), to replace the FTC and DIT has been drafted. The creation of a unitary structure for the\nauthority is in line with international practice. In addition, the institutional structure proposed by\nthe bill includes the creation of a competition tribunal, the consumer council.\n36. However, the bill still has several deficiencies and does not yet fully conform with best\npractices. For example,16 (i) the bill does not provide for dealing with monopoly situations that\nmay arise from privatization or the effects of granting investment incentives; (ii) it does not\ninclude provisions for anticompetition agreements and the operation of cartels, and needs to\nclearly define issues concerning vertical restraints;17 (iii) there is no defined jurisdictional test\n(often based on either size or market share) as a basis for seeking clearance for a merger,\nsanctions for noncompliance, and a clear interface between the takeover code under rules\nimplemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for publicly quoted companies\nand merger rules; (iv) in general, the interface between the industry regulator and the CPA is\nnot clearly defined; and (v) the investigation system is used to deal with competition matters\nrather than using a prohibition approach, i.e., no penalties are imposed for past misconduct but\nonly when there is a breach of an order.\n37. It does not seem feasible under the present law, even given adequate resources, that\nthe authorities can implement their mandate in a fair, timely, and efficient manner. Since the law\ndoes not provide that any authority (whether the proposed CPA, the consumer council, or the\ncourts) may impose a monetary penalty for past misconduct, but only upon an order being\nviolated succeeding an investigation. Even under such circumstances, the penalty imposed is\nsmall. The law therefore provides minimal deterrence. The absence of rules of procedure for the\nconduct of investigations also fails to ensure transparent and fair proceedings. The proposed\ninstitutional structure and delegation of authority, where the CPA investigates, the competition\ntribunal delivers judgment, and the ordinary courts enforce the competition tribunal\u2019s orders, do\nnot provide for timely and efficient intervention. The creation of the tribunal was based on\nconcerns about allowing the CPA to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate at the same time, as\n                                                          \n16The draft bill was reviewed against best practice under ADB TA 3075 (footnote 3).\n17Concerning agreements between suppliers and purchasers or between licensors and licensees.", "9\nthis was deemed to be against the principles of natural justice, and therefore contrary to the\nConstitution.18\n38. Until  recently,  the  incentive  structure,  owing  to  its  import  substitution  policy,  was\ndistorted  by  high  protective  tariffs  and  nontariff  barriers,  such  as  extensive  quantitative\nrestrictions on imports, export licensing, and multiple exchange rates and exchange controls.\nHowever, after 1977, trade was liberalized. Over time, export taxes have been eliminated and\nthe majority of import licensing requirements removed. Maximum tariffs have been gradually\nreduced from 60 percent in the early 1990s, to 30 percent in 1999, using a three-band system.\nFurther consolidation is to be taken and the Presidential Trade and Tariff Commission appointed\nto undertake a study of the tariff structure and recommend appropriate changes. In April 1999\nthe Government introduced the goods and services tax equivalent of the value-added tax to\nreplace the turnover tax, which had proved complicated and cumbersome, and had distortionary\neffects. Corporate income tax was also reduced from 40 to 35 percent. The exchange rate\nsystem now has virtually no restriction on international transactions and capital inflows are\nlargely permitted.\n39. At the same time, the Government introduced various export promotion programs later\nintegrated  under  BOI.  Under  Section  17  of  the  BOI  Law,  registered  enterprises  enjoy  tax\nholidays, and exemptions from tariffs on imports of capital and intermediate goods. However,\nthe package of investment incentives places considerable emphasis on tax exemptions that, in\nthe experience of other countries, have proven less effective in comparison with performance-\nbased tax deductions, allowances, and credits. Export promotion packages represent a drain on\nGovernment  revenues.  While  proving  ineffective  in  attracting  private  investments,19  such\npackages create an uneven incentive structure between domestic producers and exporters\nimpeding market competition. The Government proposed to replace the tax holidays with a 15\npercent flat income tax rate for exporters. This was not carried out, and new tax holidays were\nintroduced under the Inland Revenue Act.\n4.  Labor Market Rigidities\n40. The main source of labor market imperfection in Sri Lanka is its stringent labor law, the\nTermination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 (TEWA). Until 1971,\nthe settlement of industrial disputes and termination of employment were regulated by Act No.\n43 Industrial Disputes Act of 1950 (IDA), which has been amended several times, most recently\non 31 December 1999. The 1971 TEWA established specific procedures to be followed when\nterminating employees. The 1950 IDA continues to apply to terminations based on disciplinary\ngrounds or for cause. Under the TEWA, no worker employed by a private sector enterprise with\n15 or more employees who has worked continuously for at least 180 days can be terminated\ninvoluntarily  and  for  nondisciplinary  reasons  without  the  express  approval  of  the  labor\ncommissioner  who  has  absolute  discretion  in  granting  or  rejecting  a  request.  The  TEWA\nincludes retrenchment and termination due to incompetence or inability to perform duties. The\nTEWA also empowers the labor commissioner to fix the amount of compensation to be paid if\ntermination is approved without any firm guidelines and on a case-by-case basis. Under the\nTEWA, the decision of the labor commissioner is final and conclusive, and cannot be called in\nquestion in any court, or tribunal, or other institution established under the IDA. In subsequent\nyears the TEWA was revised to include casual labor. Its main distinction from the IDA, is that\nunder the IDA, if minimum notice was given, retrenchment may be undertaken after two months\n                                                          \n18In the European Union and other European countries, while these powers are vested in a single agency, they are\nsubject to review by specialized competition law tribunals and the ordinary courts on matters of law.\n19Surveys conducted under the World Bank\u2019s Private Sector Assessment conducted in 1995, Report 12514-CE,\nshow that investors in Sri Lanka did not consider tax holidays as critical to their investment decision.", "10\nor up to four months if conciliation and arbitration become necessary. Reinstatement remains as\na possible remedy or such relief that in the judgment of the labor tribunals is just and equitable.\nThe TEWA does not apply to public enterprises.\n41. Under  the  TEWA,  the  labor  commissioner  has  three  months  to  render  a  decision\nconcerning a request for dismissal. In practice, a response typically takes more than three\nmonths and applications remain pending for long periods. The major problems with the long\nreview process are (i) firms must continue to pay their employees during the review period and\n(ii) uncertainty surrounds the amount of compensation that firms must ultimately pay, ranging\nfrom one to nine months of salary for each year of service. Provisions relating to job security\nunder  the  TEWA  have  (i)  reduced  the  flexibility  of  private  enterprises  thus  impeding  new\ninvestments;  (ii)  compelled  firms  to  choose  overtime,  part-time,  or  contract  workers,  and\nsubcontracting and outsourcing of requirements instead of hiring of permanent staff; and (iii)\ncreated a negative impact on the work ethic and productivity, encouraging many enterprises to\noperate  in  the  black  economy.  Consequently,  many  private  sector  enterprises,  to  avoid\ncoverage under the TEWA, have kept their enterprises small and juggle excess staff among\nseveral small enterprises. Where the number of employees exceed the requirement under the\nTEWA, the true employment figure is often concealed. Voluntary retirement as a means of\nremoving  excess  labor  has  led  to  adverse  selection;  the  more  productive  and  competent\nworkers leave and obtain jobs elsewhere. There are a few exceptions \u2014 some large companies\nhave resorted to innovative techniques to deal with excess labor, such as setting up workers as\nsuppliers for the company. To promote industrial harmony and avoid labor disputes, some\ncompanies provide stock options, effectively making their employees part owners.\n42. Restrictive labor regulations have led to a segmented market, where there is a large\nwage premium in protected markets (labor and tariff) and in the public sector, vis-\u00e0-vis the\ninformal markets. This has created a large pool of educated and activist youths unwilling to take\nup jobs in the informal, unprotected sectors, and waiting for jobs in the protected markets and\nthe public sector. This job search can be for extended periods.\n43. Nonetheless,  the  TEWA  was  introduced  to  stave  off  the  adverse  impact  of  import\nrestrictions and foreign exchange shortage of the early 1970s by extending state control over\nretrenchments and expected layoffs in the private sector. The TEWA was viewed as a provision\nof social protection to employees and has played an important role in preventing social unrest\nresulting from mass layoffs.\n44. Private sector entrepreneurs, employers federations, and local economists agree on the\nTEWA\u2019s negative effects on investment in labor. In a bid to arrest the widespread evasion of\nlabor laws, and the consequent trade union activism, which often led to violent confrontations,\nthe  1995  National  Workers\u2019  Charter  was  formulated  with  the  participation  of  employers,\nbusiness representatives, and trade unions. The Government agreed to prepare a code of\nindustrial harmony defining the responsibilities of labor and employers, and to provide the\nlegislative underpinning to the Charter, an Employment and Industrial Relations Act. The first\ndraft of the act in 1996, prepared principally by the Ministry of Labor, met with severe resistance\nfrom the business community for not meeting its concerns. Subsequently, the President of Sri\nLanka appointed a task force on employment with representatives from employers, the trade\nunions and the Ministry of Labor. The task force advocated a phased relaxation of the TEWA.\nThe task force proposed the introduction of a scheme to determine a uniform formula for\nestablishing compensation for involuntary termination that would be acceptable to employers\nand employees. However, the revised 1998 draft, issued by the Ministry of Labor, contained few\nof the recommendations of the task force; employers subsequently boycotted the proceedings.\nThe issue was brought before the Prime Minister. A Presidential task force, constituted to revisit", "11\nthe issues, has submitted its recommendations. In separate meetings with employers and labor\nunions, the current version appears to be more satisfactory to both groups, as it accommodates\nmany of their recommendations. Nonetheless, the labor unions, while agreeing in principle to\nproposed reforms, wanted to directly participate in determining any uniform criteria and formula\nfor compensation of involuntary termination.\n45. World Bank estimates place one fifth of the labor force, excluding those in nonregulated\nsectors (such as the self-employed and those operating in the export processing zones) and in\nplantation agriculture and the public enterprises, as falling under the current labor regulations. In\n1999, Sri Lanka had a total workforce of 6.6 million, of which 6.1 million were employed. Of the\ntotal employment, 14 percent were in the public sector, 44 percent in the private sector, and the\nbalance in the informal sector.  Private firms make significant contributions to GDP, and based\non the World Bank\u2019s PSA survey ranked labor regulation as one of the highest constraints to\nbusiness operations, expansion or diversification.\n46. Unemployment  in  Sri  Lanka  remains  a  significant  problem  for  the  country.  The\nunemployment rate declined from an average of more than 13 percent in the first half of the\n1990s to 8.8 percent in 1999. Studies indicate that labor market rigidities and labor market\nsegmentation are the major causes of high unemployment, and pose a serious constraint to\nprivate sector development.\n5.  Access to Finance\n47. For  the  private  sector  to  participate  actively  in  economic  activities,  it  should  have\nadequate access to finance at appropriate rates and terms. The private sector faces difficulties\naccessing finance in Sri Lanka due mainly to substantial crowding out arising from Government\npreemption of funds from the system, high cost of borrowing, scarcity of long-term funds, and an\nunderdeveloped capital market. Consequently, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) findings\nshow that the fund requirements of private companies are to a large extent met internally, then\nfrom development finance institutions, and finally from commercial banks.\n48. Government  preemption  of  funds  from  the  financial  system  stems  from  its  large\nborrowing requirements caused by its historically large budget deficits. Total Government debt\nis about 95 percent of GDP and has grown in inflation-adjusted terms by 5 percent on average\nsince  1994.  Reliance  on  domestic  funding  sources  has  increased  in  recent  years,  with  a\nconsequent reduction in the share of foreign borrowing. In 1999, the share of foreign borrowing\nby  the  Government,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  was  approximately  46  percent,  domestic\nborrowing comprised 49 percent. Foreign debt has been higher on average since 1994. The\nGovernment uses different instruments to borrow from the domestic market. Rupee loans, which\nare  fixed-rate,  fixed-term  nonnegotiable  instruments,  constitute  a  large  portion  of  domestic\nGovernment debt. Rupee loans are issued at administratively determined rates that are below\nmarket rates and therefore distortionary. The maturity of a rupee loan is typically from 2 to 10\nyears,  although  it  may  extend  up  to  30  years.  The  bulk  of  such  loans  are  held  by  the\nEmployees\u2019  Provident  Fund  (EPF)  and  the  Employees\u2019  Trust  Fund  (ETF);  Government-\nadministered provident funds for private and public enterprises; and the National Savings Bank\n(NSB), a Government-owned specialized financial institution.\n49. The other major instrument is the Treasury bill (T-bill), which is auctioned through the\nCentral  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL).  T-bills  comprise  about  half  of  the  total  rupee  loans\noutstanding. T-bill maturities range from three months to one year. Prior to 1983, CBSL held\npractically the entire issue of T-bills. However, as T-bill rates became market related, the share\nheld by CBSL declined to about 20 percent at the end of 1999. The major portion is now held by", "12\nnonbank financial institutions and the public. The first issue of Treasury bonds with a two-year\nmaturity was made in 1997. Since then, maturities have lengthened; the most recent issue in\nSeptember 1999 at six years. However, Treasury bonds still comprise a small portion of total\noutstanding Government securities at about 19 percent in 1999, up from 11 percent in 1998\n(Supplementary Appendix A lists outstanding Government securities and borrowings). The three\nGovernment banks, NSB, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), and People\u2019s Bank (PB), which act as primary\ndealers in Government securities, including EPF and ETF, dominate the T-bill auctions (with an\nestimated share of over 50 percent in 1999). Government preemption of funds ranges from as\nmuch as close to 98 percent for the EPF, approximately 70 percent for ETF, over 80 percent for\nNSB, 30-50 percent for the Government-owned insurance companies, and 30-35 percent for the\nstate commercial banks. Along with the relatively high rates of inflation, interest rates have\ntherefore remained at high levels due to substantial Government borrowing from the domestic\nfinancial market.\n50. The two state banks, BOC and PB, despite the growth in market share of private\ncommercial banks in recent years, still dominate the banking system in Sri Lanka, accounting\nfor slightly over 50 percent of deposits and loans. While only 30 to 35 percent of loans by\nGovernment commercial banks are directed credits, such loans account for the bulk of their\nnonperforming portfolio. Based on official data, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of\nthe two state banks was close to 20 percent at the end of 1998. However, according to a\ndiagnostic review by international auditors commissioned by the World Bank in 1998 at the\nrequest  of  the  Government,  and  based  on  international  standards  for  classification  and\nprovisioning as of September 1998, only 26 percent of the loan portfolio of PB was fully\nperforming and only 40 percent in the case of BOC. Add this to the high level of staff costs20\ninterest spreads of these banks are bound to rise contributing to the already high cost of funds\nof borrowers. Current spreads range from about 6 to 9 percent. Because of the low level of\ncompetition, the private sector banks take advantage of the high costs of operations of the\ndominant state banks and charge similarly high rates of interest to their borrowers.\n51. NSB raises funds from the public through time and savings deposits and invests mainly\nin  Government  securities.  NSB  has  about  12  million  deposit  accounts  that  are  transacted\nthrough 100 branch offices and 4,100 post and subpost offices, with a total of 2,800 employees.\nTotal deposits of NSB increased from SLRs60 billion in 1995 to SLRs93 billion ($1.2 billion) in\n1999. All deposits at NSB are guaranteed by the Government.\n52. According to the NSB (Amended) Act in 1995, NSB must invest at least 60 percent of its\ndeposits  in  Government  or  Government-guaranteed  securities.  Nonetheless,  claims  on\nGovernment and Government-guaranteed securities was over 80 percent in 1998. Historically,\nNSB has paid deposit rates higher than the private banks.\n53. EPF, the largest provident fund administered by the Government with approximately 8\nmillion accounts, of which 1.9 million accounts are active, is presently the largest tax-paying\ninstitution in Sri Lanka, holds about 40 percent of domestic Government debt, EPF reported\ntotal assets of SLRs186 billion ($2.5 billion) at the end of 1999. CBSL\u2019s Monetary Board acts as\nthe EPF\u2019s board; this creates a conflict of interest as CBSL is also responsible for the sale of\nGovernment issues. ETF, on the other hand, had investments in Government issues of about 70\npercent of total assets at the end of 1999. ETF has about 30 percent invested in private\ncorporate securities, of which about 10 percent are in shares of stock. However, ETF equity\ninvestments  have  fared  badly.  Certain  investments  may  have  been  made  for  other  than\n                                                          \n20A recent audit estimated SLRs6.8 billion loss provision required for PB. Consultants estimate about 22 percent of\ncosts constitute excess staff for BOC in 1998; the estimates for PB were unavailable although PB has more staff\nwith a worse loan portfolio.", "13\ncommercial  reasons.  ETF  purchased  up  to  99  percent  of  the  issued  shares  from  the\nGovernment for Lanka Salt, and took 51 percent stake of a privatized plantation. Other projects\nsuch as a welfare fund, and a labor consultancy bureau, were not-for-profit projects. Currently,\nETF has about 1.7 million active members with assets of around SLRs24 billion (about $308\nmillion).  ETF  is  supervised  by  a  board  comprising  representatives  of  various  Government\nministries, the Employers\u2019 Federation, and the large trade unions. Employers may opt to set up\napproved private provident funds (PPFs) with the approval of the labor commissioner. In 1999,\nthere were 204 private provident funds with total membership of about 131,715 and holding\napproximately  SLRs40.5  billion  ($519  million)  of  assets.  The  funds  invest  mainly  in  bank\nsecurities, currently, with little effective regulation.\n54. Eight  insurance  companies  operate  in  Sri  Lanka:  two  are  state  owned:  Sri  Lanka\nInsurance  Corporation  Ltd  (SLIC)  and  National  Insurance  Corporation  Ltd  (NIC).  The  two\ncompanies were incorporated as public limited companies in 1993. Up to 1986, both SLIC and\nNIC were the only insurers in the country. The total assets of the sector increased from about\nSLRs15 billion in 1995 to approximately SLRs27 billion ($346 million) in 1999.21 Private sector\ninsurance companies accounted for about 44 percent of the nonlife insurance market and 54\npercent of the life insurance market measured in terms of gross written premium in 1999. SLIC,\nwith total gross written premium of SLRs2.0 billion, is about 14 times the size of NIC in terms of\nbusiness volume. Insurance companies are required to invest in Government securities: up to\n50 percent for life insurance and 30 percent for nonlife insurance companies. Public enterprises\nare required to insure their risks with either NIC or SLIC as prescribed by Public Enterprise\nCircular No. 94 of 1994. The private insurance companies are also required to provide a 15\npercent reinsurance cession to NIC. The Exchange Control Act 1992 included a limit on foreign\ninvestment in insurance companies of up to 40 percent. However, the limitation apparently did\nnot extend to investments using holding companies. Consequently, in May 1998, the Zurich\nGroup was able to acquire 80 percent of CTC Eagle Insurance Co.\n55. Investment funds are institutional investors in Sri Lanka. ADB assisted the establishment\nof the first unit trust (mutual fund) in Sri Lanka sponsored by the DFCC Bank (formerly the\nDevelopment Finance Corporation of Ceylon).22 Currently, 12 unit trusts23 and five closed-end\ninvestment funds are listed on the CSE. Two closed-end country funds were established in 1993\nand 1994. The first unit trusts were balanced growth funds, and were heavily into equities.\nConsequently their performance reflect the almost continuous downtrend in the stock market\nsince 1992. The investment funds have reported a total net asset value of SLRs2.4 billion ($31\nmillion) as of 1999. At present, the income funds are diversified over a wide range of fixed-\nincome  instruments.  These  include  corporate  debentures,  T-bills,  and  Treasury  bonds,\ncommercial papers, repurchase agreements, and bank deposits.\n56. The domestic capital market remains a marginal source of capital with low market\ncapitalization and slow trading activity, hence it is relatively illiquid (Supplementary Appendix B\nprovides  a  comparison  with  other  South  Asian  capital  markets).  Initiatives  under  ADB\u2019s\nFinancial  Sector  Program  (footnote  10),  such  as  the  liberalization  of  foreign  investments,\nrationalization  of  taxes  on  share  transactions,  the  granting  of  licenses  to  unit  trusts,24,\nprivatization of public enterprises, and amendment of the Securities Council Act to empower the\n                                                          \n21Annual Report, CBSL. 1999.\n22TA SRI 1023: Establishment of a Domestic Unit Trust, for $230,000, approved on 4 August 1988.\n23Open-end investment funds structured as unit trusts under Sri Lankan law where the funds are created by entering\ninto a deed of trust between a fund management company, which invests the funds on behalf of unitholders, and\nan independent trustee.\n24ADB helped set up and invested in the first unit trust in Sri Lanka under TA SRI 1023: Establishment of Domestic\nUnit trust, for $230,000, approved on 4 August 1988, and LOE SRI 7061: NDBSL/DFCC/CDIC/MBSL, for $2\nmillion, approved on 20 November 1990.", "14\nSecurities  Council  (precursor  of  the  SEC),  influenced  rapid  capital  market  growth  and\ndevelopment during 1991-1994.\n57. Aside from the high interest regime prevailing in the past, the uncertainty over the civil\nconflict, and the recent crisis in East Asia25, weaknesses that keep the domestic capital market\nlargely inactive include (i) limited number of quality securities listed: in 1999, of 237 listed\ncompanies, 10 accounted for around 40 percent of market capitalization and 8 for around 40\npercent of trades ; (ii) few institutional investors because of the limited participation by the\nprovident  funds  and  insurance  companies  due  to  prevailing  investment  restrictions;  (iii)\nprohibition on foreign participation in investment areas such as mutual funds and securities\nfirms\u2019 operation; and (iv) lack of instruments and mechanisms to promote market activity and\nmitigate investment risk, such as margin lending, stock borrowing and lending, and hedging\ninstruments.\n58. On the supply side, the CSE estimates that the cost of equity funds is about 17-21\npercent;  other  market  players  believe  it  is  higher.  This  compares  with  the  cost  of  bank\nborrowings of about 13 to 18 percent, which is also tax deductible. Lenient credit requirements,\nparticularly by the state banks, make borrowing even more attractive. Moreover, issuers are\nreluctant to disclose information about their businesses and wish to maintain control.\n59. The corporate debt market has remained thin with a limited number of issues. Large,\nhigh net worth, public limited liability companies raise short-term funds by issuing commercial\npapers and, to a limited extent, medium-term funds by issuing debentures. Factors that inhibit\nthe  faster  growth  of  a  market  for  debt  securities  include  the  absence  of  an  acceptable\nbenchmark for pricing corporate debt, market uncertainty, and lack of a liquid secondary market\nfor securities. The need for a credit-rating agency has been filled by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating\nLanka  Ltd,  which  became  operational  in  October  1999.  By  the  end  of  1999,  market\ncapitalization of listed debentures amounted to SLRs4.6 billion against SLRs3.7 billion at the\nend of 1998.\n60. Weak market regulation contributes to the low level of confidence and market weakness.\nAreas  such  as  securities  underwriting,  investment  management,  and  commercial  paper\ndealership are unregulated. Unlisted securities, which are traded off the exchange, are virtually\nunregulated as under the prevailing law they do not fall within the jurisdiction of the SEC.\nMoreover, the SEC\u2019s scope of authority to enforce market regulations is limited to investigation\nand bringing suit before the courts.\n61. Consequently, the development finance institutions, the DFCC Bank and NDB, continue\nto be the major sources of long-term finance, accounting for around 30 percent of market\ncapitalization.  However,  DFCC  Bank  and  NDB  still  rely  heavily  on  multilateral  financial\nsources.26 In the domestic market, both DFCC Bank and NDB have been able to raise small\namounts of funding from NSB and the Government-administered provident funds. NDB has\nissued floating rate debentures of about SLRs500 million in 1999. More recently, DFCC Bank\nfloated SLRs1.5 billion of five-year SLTL debentures, the oversubscription of the debentures\nindicates that a market can develop with the proper incentives. Given the size of the debenture\nissue, SLTL would have had difficulty raising the required funds from purely banking sources.\nSupplementary Appendix C provides a profile of Sri Lanka's financial sector.\n                                                          \n25Foreign investors comprise a large portion of the investor market accounting for approximately 40 percent of total\nsales and 34 percent of all purchases at the CSE in 1999.\n26Approximately 70 and 37 percent of DFCC and NDB borrowings, respectively, were from these sources in 1999.", "15\nC.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n62. The Government\u2019s vision for the medium term is to achieve an economic growth rate of\n7 to 8 percent and raise per capita annual income from slightly above SLRs65,000 ($837) to\nSLRs175,000 ($2,240) by 2010. The Government is also committed to raising the share of\nincome of the poor from the current 4 percent to 15 percent by 2010. Considering the average\ngrowth  rate  of  5.2  percent  achieved  in  the  past  10  years,  both  targets,  are  regarded  as\nambitious and highly optimistic for the country in general and for the poor in particular. To\nachieve these ambitious targets, the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s economic strategy is\nprivate sector-led development. A private sector-led development strategy could provide the\nnecessary momentum that could lift economic growth rates and reduce poverty to the targets\nthat the Government is aiming for.\n63. The Government\u2019s fiscal policy is to be aligned to support this strategy and will aim to\nincrease public savings, contain the budget deficit, reduce domestic borrowing, and thereby\nrelease more resources to be productively used by the private sector. The budget deficit is to be\nreduced from 7.5 percent in 1999, to 4 percent in the medium term, and 3 percent by 2010. The\nGovernment will (i) liberalize the financial sector by opening it up to foreign investments and\nenhance access to new products and technologies, (ii) modernize the country\u2019s infrastructure to\nimprove services required by the private sector, and (iii) facilitate private sector entry into\ninfrastructure  development.  In  parallel,  the  Government  is  aiming  to  improve  public  sector\nefficiency, and Government expenditure control and management; introduce a performance-\nbased  salary  system;  reformulate  the  pension  system;  and  undertake  organizational\nimprovements in key agencies. Structural weaknesses will continue to be addressed while\nmaintaining the present levels of human development.\n64. Sri Lanka hopes to fully exploit its locational advantage and establish itself as a regional\nhub for shipping, aviation, trade, and financial services.\nD.  External Assistance to the Sector\n65. Japan,  ADB,  and  the  World  Bank  continue  to  be  the  major  sources  of  external\nassistance to Sri Lanka, but significant assistance also continues to be provided by bilateral\nfunding agencies. Norway is providing assistance to find a peaceful settlement to the ongoing\nconflict. The International Labour Organisation is providing assistance with labor market issues.\nDue to the significant economic and financial impact of the civil conflict and the Government\u2019s\nefforts to reduce the budget deficit, aid-financed projects constitute a significant proportion of\nthe overall public sector investment program. This situation is expected to continue in the\nmedium term.\n66. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has a resident adviser in Sri Lanka, mainly\nadvising the Government on macroeconomic policy-related issues. IMF\u2019s Article IV Consultation\nmission visits the country on an annual basis; ADB has been closely consulted and/or actively\nparticipating  in  the  consultation  missions.  The  proposed  advisory  TA  for  Governance  and\nInstitutional Support for Private Sector Development, which was formulated closely with IMF and\nthe World Bank, aims to promote good governance and build capacity of regulatory authorities\noverseeing private sector activity.\n67. Japanese development assistance continues to emphasize supporting improvements of\nkey physical infrastructure, but recently, this was broadened to include social infrastructure and\nthe environment. Accordingly, there are several sectors where cofinancing is being explored,\nsuch  as  roads,  port  development,  energy,  natural  resources  management,  and  rural", "16\ndevelopment. The World Bank assistance, through the International Development Association,\nfocuses  mainly  on  general  and  teacher  education,  health,  irrigation  rehabilitation,\ntelecommunications reform, and urban transport. The World Bank has programmed about $440\nmillion for Sri Lanka during 2000-2002, targeting legal reform, postal service reform, land titling,\nport  efficiency  improvement,  water  and  sanitation,  power  restructuring  (in  cooperation  with\nADB),  food  marketing,  and  health.  Additional  assistance  includes  an  emergency  loan  for\nirrigation rehabilitation in the north and east. Depending on the Government\u2019s commitment to\nreform, the World Bank is also considering assistance for civil service and pension reform.\n68. Among the other leading external agencies supporting private sector development in Sri\nLanka are Germany, United States, and Sweden. Assistance from Germany is mainly focused\non the development of private sector infrastructure, and assistance from the US on policy and\nregulatory reforms for financial markets, trade, and investments. Assistance from the Swedish\nInternational Development Cooperation Agency for private sector development focuses on the\ndevelopment of a bond market in Sri Lanka and labor-related issues such as the training of\nmediators and arbitrators for specific labor cases. Close consultations with the major external\naid agencies were conducted during program preparation especially IMF and the World Bank.\nADB will continue to collaborate closely with other development partners active in promoting\nprivate sector development.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n69. ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  (1999)  identifies  private  sector\ndevelopment as one of the key areas for ADB support through the promotion of policy and\ninstitutional reforms to assist Sri Lanka reduce poverty and achieve sustainable growth. ADB\u2019s\nstrategy to enhance private sector development follows a two-pronged approach: (i) promote an\nenabling environment for private sector involvement using ADB\u2019s public sector window; and (ii)\ndirectly invest in private sector companies using loans and equity through ADB\u2019s Private Sector\nGroup.\n70. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in Sri Lanka include three loans totaling $46.1 million\nand six equity investments totaling $10.9 million for nine projects. The most recent loan and\nequity investment was provided for the Queen Elizabeth Quay in Colombo Port.27 TA was\napproved in 1999 to examine the technical, economic, financial, environmental, and institutional\nfeasibility of developing Colombo port\u2019s south harbor, an area adjacent and complementary to\nthe  ongoing  port  project.28  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Group  will  continue  to  focus  mainly  on\ninfrastructure projects that require large funding. This includes assistance to independent power\nproducers and water supply projects.\n71. ADB has also provided two partial credit guarantees to Sri Lanka for the Small and\nMedium  Enterprise  Assistance  Project29  and  the  Credit  Enhancement  Facility  for  Private\nEnterprises.30 These initiatives aimed to help the country gain access to international financial\nmarkets and catalyze private capital inflows to support private sector development and assist in\nreducing poverty in the rural and semirural areas of the country.\n                                                          \n27Loan 1689-SRI: Colombo Port Development Project, for a $36.1 million loan and a $7.4 million equity investment,\napproved on 11 May 1999.\n28TA 3276-SRI: Colombo Port South Harbor Development, for $1.46 million, approved on 13 October 1999.\n29Loan 7137-SRI: Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $5, million approved on 5 June 1997.\n30Loan 7149: Enhancement Facility for Private Enterprises, for $5 million, approved on 8 September 1998.", "17\nV.  THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n72. Despite the civil conflict, Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP has managed to grow over the last two\ndecades by an average annual rate of above 5 percent. The opening up of the Sri Lankan\neconomy in 1977 and the liberalization of trade and industry in 1989 largely account for this\ngrowth. The economy has responded positively to Government initiatives to reform.\n73. However, to attain growth of 7-8 percent, as targetted by the Government as its goal for\nthe  medium  term,  the  country  must  aim  for  intensive  growth  anchored  upon  improved\nefficiencies and greater productivity. This can only be achieved by a robust and dynamic private\nsector operating within a properly regulated, stable, competitive, and efficient market system.31\nOnly sustained growth can lower unemployment and reduce poverty.\n74. Sri  Lanka  has  failed  to  fully  capitalize  on  earlier  reforms  liberalizing  the  trade  and\nindustrial  environment,  as  market  impediments  have  continued  to  constrain  private  sector\nactivity. These impediments include the large and inefficient public enterprise sector, lack of\ncompetitive markets due to deficiencies in the policy framework and weak incentive structure,\nlabor market rigidities, and limited access to finance.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n75. The objective of the PSDP is to facilitate private sector participation in the Sri Lankan\neconomy  by  supporting  reforms  to  promote  efficiency  and  productivity  essential  for  higher\neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB  assistance  will  aim  to  help  Sri  Lanka  (i)\nconsolidate and build upon the gains already achieved with earlier reforms, and (ii) move to a\nhigher and sustainable growth regime with the private sector as the prime mover of economic\ngrowth.\n76. To achieve this objective, constraints that prevent the private sector from realizing its full\npotential must be eliminated, and the market environment enhanced to promote competition and\nthereby generate higher levels of savings and investments, and raise efficiency and productivity.\nSubprogram  I  of  the  PSDP  seeks  to  develop  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\nparticipation, strengthen regulatory and institutional capacity to facilitate and oversee private\nsector activity and market operations, improve the public-private interface, and prepare the\ngroundwork  for  sector  liberalization.  Subprogram  II  of  the  PSDP  will  aim  to  liberalize  the\ninfrastructure and other sectors that remain under closed state ownership and control. Thus,\nindependent regulatory authorities for water supply, power, and ports will be set up. In parallel,\npublic  infrastructure  institutions  will  be  restructured,  unbundled,  and  corporatized.  In  the\nfinancial sector, the state banks will also start raising capital from private sources as the\nGovernment ceases funding for them. Other reform actions will update, modify or complete\nreforms initiated earlier. Thus, competition policy and consumer protection (paras. 36 and 37)\nare to be reinforced to incorporate best practices and issues that arise from the Sri Lankan\nexperience. After a proposed ADB study, tax incentives will be rationalized to promote domestic\ncompetition. A study of a formal social security system to institutionalize social protection will be\nconducted. Government guarantees on deposits will be eliminated, and a deposit insurance\nscheme for small depositors will be established. Reform of old-age pensions and provident\n                                                          \n31A  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  sponsored  study  on  Sri  Lankan  competitiveness\n(September 1998) arrived basically at the same conclusion. Future competitiveness will depend less on past\ndrivers of growth, trade incentives, quotas, low labor cost, quality of raw materials, etc. than on the quality of the\nprivate sector strategy, industry leadership, and effective private-public dialogue.", "18\nfunds will be undertaken to strengthen the role of contractual savings institutions in capital\nmarket development and to enhance social protection.\n77. Subprogram I of the PSDP has the following key components: (i) sustain and reinforce\nthe Government\u2019s privatization and public enterprise reform program, (ii) facilitate private sector\nentry  and  participation  in  infrastructure  development,  (iii)  enhance  the  market  system  by\npromoting fair market competition and the appropriate regulation of private sector activity, (iv)\nincrease labor market mobility and provide protection for workers through suitable social safety\nnets, and (v) improve private sector access to finance.\n78. The PSDP was formulated in close consultation with other funding agencies, particularly,\nIMF, World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Sectoral policies are being\npursued by other assistance agencies and other departments within ADB under their respective\nprograms. Appendix 3 presents the structure of reform and donor coordination.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n79. The key reform areas and the specific time-bound policy actions are defined in detail in\nthe policy matrix ( Appendix 2) and the program framework in Appendix4. A description of the\npolicy reform program (Subprograms I and II) follows.\n1.  Privatization and Public Enterprise Reform\n80. The fundamental objective of privatization and public enterprise reform is to promote\neconomic efficiency. A residual effect is to offset the adverse impact of loss-making public\nenterprises on public finances.32 Efficiency is essentially achieved by substituting market-based\nallocation  using  the  private  sector,  which  operates  on  the  basis  of  commercial  principles\ntempered  by  competitive  market  forces  that  impose  the  necessary  discipline  on  market\nparticipants and bring about technological innovation.\n81. Under  the  PSDP,  the  Government  has  committed  to  (i)  privatize  identified  public\nenterprises engaged in commercial activities; (ii) undertake preparatory work for other public\nenterprises necessary prior to privatization, e.g., corporatization; (iii) institutionalize a corporate\ngovernance framework in public enterprises; and (iv) prepare a medium-term strategic plan for\nprivatizing  remaining  public  enterprises  engaged  in  commercial  operations,  and  conduct  a\nnationwide public awareness campaign to secure stakeholder support for privatization during\nPSDP implementation. The PERC, which has undertaken the privatization of public enterprises\nsince  1995,  will  undertake  these  tasks  as  mandated  by  the  Government.  Supplementary\nAppendix D provides a profile of PERC, its functions and operations. ADB support is critical as\nWorld Bank funding to meet PERC\u2019s operational costs has ceased with the completion of its TA.\nThe Government is currently meeting PERC costs directly from its budget. To sustain this effort,\nthe Government will prepare an overall strategic plan for the privatization of the remaining public\nenterprises  engaged  in  commercial  operations,  supported  by  a  detailed  and  appropriately\nsequenced implementation program. This will form the basis for seeking political bipartisan\nsupport and for launching a public awareness campaign. It would be useful for the Government\nto undertake a review of the performance, impact, and benefits of its privatization program,\nwhich could serve as the basis for finetuning its approach, seeking public support, and justifying\nfuture privatizations. This review will be assisted by ADB under the TA for Governance and\nInstitutional Support for Private Sector Development which will include an assessment of the\n                                                          \n32This is not significant in Sri Lanka. An approximation of total current and capital transfers to public corporations\nshow about 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent of GDP for 1996 and 1997 respectively.", "19\ntransparency  and  overall  integrity  of  the  privatization  process  as  it  is  currently  conducted\n(Supplementary Appendix E) The Government will concomitantly review the present public\nenterprise system to rationalize its role within the economy in view of a greater role being\naccorded to the private sector, reevaluate the economic justification for the continued existence\nof remaining public enterprises, and determine actions that may be required in the interest of\nefficient public administration.33\n82. The PERC program 2000-2003 targets privatizations and divestments of about SLRs2.0\nbillion (about $25.6 million) in 2000, SLRs22 billion (about $282 million) in 2001, SLRs11 billion\n(about $141 million) by the end of 2002, and SLRs7.4 billion (about $95 million) by the end of\n2003.34 The largest contribution under the 2000 program will result from divesting an additional\n14 percent of SriLankan Airlines to its strategic partner, Emirates, after the earlier sale of 26\npercent. In 2001-2002, the most significant will be the privatization of SLTL with the sale of an\nadditional 40 percent of Government holdings, following the 35 percent divestment to Nippon\nTelegraph and Telephone Corporation, which is expected to produce SLRs20 billion of net\nproceeds.  The  Merchant  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  and  HSBC  Investment  Bank  PLC  have  been\nselected to manage the initial public offering of SLTL. Share distribution is expected to be done\nthrough a public listing on the CSE and an international stock exchange. The balance of 49\npercent still held by the Government in Shell Gas is also to be divested, and the initial sale of 35\npercent of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, valued at SLRs10 billion, will be undertaken. For\n2003, the major privatization targeted is for the corporatized Colombo Port (Jaya Container\nTerminal). Supplementary Appendix F presents the PERC program, identifying the specific firms\ntargeted for privatization/divestment, including sectors to be liberalized.\n83. Commercialization  of  public  enterprises  still  under  Government  control  will  be\ninstitutionalized under a corporate governance framework. The same principles will apply to\nprivatized enterprises. For this, the Government will introduce a code of best practice and\nprinciples of good governance.35 The code will include, the following:\n(i)  a public enterprise mission statement that will cover the enterprise\u2019s objectives,\nnature and scope of activities, performance targets, and commitments, which will\nform the basis for assessing its achievements;\n(ii)  structures for privatized enterprises and public enterprises with shareholders that\nshould facilitate the exercise of basic shareholder rights, such as, electing the\nboard of directors and fixing the remuneration of board directors; amending the\npublic enterprise statutes or articles of incorporation; changing share capital; and\nvoting and participating in shareholder meetings; appointing external auditors;\nand receiving relevant and timely information;\n(iii)  structure that should ensure autonomy of the public enterprise either (i) with an\nappointed  autonomous  board  of  directors,  based  on  merit,  with  majority\nrepresentation from the private sector, and with a balance between executive\nand  nonexecutive  independent  board  members;36  or  (iii)  by  entering  into\nmanagement contracts with suitable private organizations for public enterprise\n                                                          \n33This  review  is  proposed  to  be  assisted  by  an  ADB  project  preparatory  TA  for  an  action  plan  for  public\nadministration reforms/decentralization scheduled in 2001.\n34 Based on expected sales proceeds.\n35The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka published a Code of Best Practice on Financial Aspects of\nCorporate Governance for the use of Listed Companies at the CSE dated 12 December 1997.\n36Defined as being separate from management and bears no relationship to any business firm or organization that\ncould influence impartial judgment.", "20\noperation.  Both  structures  should  be  subject  to  periodic  review  for  possible\nchanges;\n(iv)  the role of the board of directors that is clearly defined, with delegated powers\nand accountability, which should include, overseeing management performance;\ndetermining management compensation; selecting and replacing key executives;\nreviewing and approving major corporate decisions such as, strategic plans,\nannual  budgets,  risk  management  policies,  system  of  internal  control,  and\nfinancial reporting; and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws including\npublic  disclosure  and  laws  relating  to  conflict  of  interest  and  related  party\ntransactions;\n(v)  the  role  of  management  that  is  based  on  a  clear  mandate  and  expected\nperformance, subject to specified targets and specific measurement, with an\nappropriate division of responsibilities and delegation of approval authority;\n(vi)  recruitment and selection of management for key positions that are subject to\nspecified qualification criteria which are performance based and follow a formal\nand transparent procedure;\n(vii)  adoption of international accounting and auditing standards and disclosure norms\nthat should be adhered to.37\n(viii)  a system to disseminate information, including annual audited accounts, in a\ncost-efficient and timely manner, to the general public;\n(ix)  appointed audit committee composed of members of the nonexecutive members\nof the board directors; an internal auditor that reports to the board of directors to\nensure the adequacy and integrity of internal controls, of the risk management\nsystem, including the preservation of assets, and of the management information\nsystem.\n84. To enforce the code, the Government is expected to set up corporate governance units\nunder  the  Public  Finance  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning  for  public\nenterprises and under the SEC for publicly listed companies to oversee adherence to the code.\nThe proposed ADB TA, which includes a component on corporate governance, will help develop\na suitable framework and consider the structure, scope of authority, and capacity building\nrequirements of the proposed corporate governance units.\n2.  Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure\n85. Infrastructure deficiences pose serious constraints to private sector activity. In 1996, a\nsevere power crisis was experienced. While power generation facilities have been improved,\ndemand is forecast to expand at an annual rate of 9 percent over the next 10 years; the annual\ninvestment required for generation, transmission, and distribution is estimated to be about $300\nmillion. SLTL, the only fixed wire line and international telephone service provider in the country,\ngranted 133,709 new connections in 1999, and 44,818 up to June 2000, but has 246,560\napplications on its waiting list. The total number of fixed and cellular phones per 100 people in\n                                                          \n37The Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Act was passed in 1995 and has empowered the Institute of\nChartered Accountants of Sri Lanka to adopt appropriate accounting and auditing standards for Sri Lanka and to\nset up an independent monitoring board to ensure compliance. The Urgent Issues Task Force was also organized\nto provide interpretation and clarification of the accounting standards.", "21\nSri Lanka is about 4.6 compared with 10 in other low middle-income countries and 67 in high-\nincome countries.38 The container-handling capacity at the port of Colombo was exceeded in\n1997 resulting in increased average vessel waiting and berth stay times. Water and sanitation\ncoverage  is  estimated  at  approximately  64  percent  of  requirements.  While  road  and  rail\nnetworks are very extensive, with nearly 100,000 kilometers of roads and 1,570 kilometers of\ntrack, substantial maintenance and upgrading is required. The capital outlays to meet expected\ninfrastructure  requirements  are  large  and  beyond  what  the  Government  and  multilateral\nfinancing agencies can reasonably provide.\n86. Moreover, the private sector assessment survey conducted by the World Bank revealed\nwidespread  dissatisfaction  with  the  quality  and  reliability  of  infrastructure  services.\nConsequently, as part of the Government strategy to address resource constraints and the need\nto improve efficiency, the role of the private sector in infrastructure provision is being expanded\nand public enterprises engaged in infrastructure services are being divested or privatized.\n87. ADB assistance has been requested to sustain this effort after United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) assistance ceased. To minimize delay, the Government has\nreviewed the current process and procedures for granting approvals to private sector sponsors.\nOne of the options for facilitating the process is to delegate the project committee deliberation\nfunctions from senior management to full-time staff within the line agencies and ministries\nconcerned dedicated to the handling of BOO/BOT projects. The same staff could coordinate\nwith BII at every phase of the approval process. This is expected to improve coordination by line\nministries and agencies with BII, and expedite the approval process. The Government will also\nprovide guidelines for investors identifying the step-by-step process for securing approvals\nbased on a reasonable time schedule. In parallel, an appeals process whereby investors may\nseek redress for their grievances has been established. Deviations from the time schedule\nshould form the basis of reasonable complaints and review. BII staff concerned should provide\nfor sufficient justification for actions to be taken to rectify the problem. Undue delays in project\napprovals may now be referred to the Public Finance Department of MOFP for appropriate\naction.\n88. Over  the  medium  term,  the  Government  has  committed  to  establish  appropriate\nindependent  regulatory  authorities  for  the  infrastructure  sectors  opened  to  private  sector\nparticipation.  The  authorities  will  be  responsible  for  approving,  licensing,  and  monitoring\ninfrastructure projects, and will set up the required regulatory and supervisory frameworks to set\ntariffs and prices, and deal with the private sector and oversee their activities. In the port sector,\nthe World Bank is providing support to the Government through its Colombo Port Efficiency\nImprovement Project to establish regulatory oversight over the port sector. An ongoing ADB TA\nis preparing a feasibility study for developing Colombo Port\u2019s south harbor.39 In water supply, a\nregulatory body is being established under the ADB-assisted Third Water Supply and Sanitation\nProject.40 In the power sector, at the Government\u2019s request, ADB and the World Bank are\nundertaking a collaborative effort to reform and unbundle the power sector. A restructuring study\nhas been initiated by the World Bank to consider sector structure, ownership, and regulation.\nThe Government expects new power sector reform legislation to be drafted by mid-2001 to\nseparate power generation, transmission, and distribution operations of the Ceylon Electricity\nBoard, the main power provider in Sri Lanka. The new power sector legislation will replace the\nexisting Ceylon Electricity Board Act and the Electricity Act, and in parallel create a power\nregulatory commission. The proposed ADB Power Sector Restructuring Program in 2001 will\nhelp the Government undertake the restructuring of Ceylon Electricity Board. The World Bank\n                                                          \n38As of 1996. Prospectus of Sri Lanka Telecom Debentures 2000/2005. 21 February 2000.\n39 TA 3276-SRI: Port of Colombo South Harbor Development, for $1,460,000, approved on 13 October 1999.\n40Loan 1575-SRI: Third Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $75 million, approved on 6 November 1997.", "22\nwill  help  set  up  the  regulator  as  well  as  undertake  new  sector  investments  to  strengthen\nefficiency.  The  restructuring  of  the  Airport  and  Aviation  Services,  which  administers  the\nBandaranaike International Airport and domestic airports in Sri Lanka, will aim to improve the\nairport\u2019s  services,  and  consider  development  options  and  private  sector  participation  in\ninfrastructure in line with the plan to develop the airport as a passenger and cargo hub for South\nAsia. Furthermore, the Government will pursue deregulation of the petroleum industry and\nremove restrictions on the import and distribution of marine and aviation fuel and finished\npetroleum products. The Government recognizes the urgent need to restructure the industry in\norder  to  attract  capital  investment  sorely  needed  to  meet  projected  demand.  The  Ceylon\nPetroleum Corporation, the country\u2019s only refinery, has projected requirements of $372 million\nover the next five years. Deregulation will entail a restructuring into refining, marketing and\ndistribution,  bunkering,  aviation,  and  industrial  fuel  operations;  introducing  environmental\nfriendly fuel (unleaded petrol and low sulfur diesel oil) as part of the Clean Air 2000 Plan; setting\nup an independent petroleum regulator; liberalizing prices; rationalizing the tax structure; and\nopening  up  of  these  operations  to  private  sector  investments.  Accordingly,  the  Ceylon\nPetroleum Corporation Act and other relevant acts will be amended. ADB assistance has been\nproposed for a study of pricing policy in the petroleum subsector for 2001, an integrated energy\nsector masterplan for 2002, and development of the petroleum subsector in 2003. In the road\nsector, ADB is the main dialogue partner of the Government on sectoral policy reforms. The\nongoing TA to develop the roads sector41 is helping identify and address the main constraints to\nthe  orderly  and  efficient  management  of  roads.  The  TA  will  provide  the  foundation  for\nformulating  an  action  program  for  reform  of  the  roads  sector.  However  it  is  too  early  to\ndetermine whether the operation of privately managed toll roads would be a viable option.\n3. Competition Policy and Consumer Protection\n89. Privatization and liberalization in Sri Lanka have not been anchored appropriately on\neffective regulatory frameworks and a clear competition policy. For the country to benefit from\ngreater private sector activity, it must foster competition to enhance efficiency, while regulating\nprivate sector activity to ensure that investor and consumer rights are adequately protected.\nThis is of particular concern because existing Government monopolies are being transferred to\nthe private sector, especially in the various infrastructure sectors. Privatization of the gas sector\nand divestment of SriLankan Airlines in civil aviation are examples. Moreover, in many respects,\nthe economy is dominated by a relatively small number of players, e.g., in plantation agriculture,\nhotel industry, and banking.\n90. Consequently, a consumer protection authority (CPA) bill has been drafted covering\ncompetition policy and consumer protection (paras. 35-37). The draft bill has met with strong\nopposition from various quarters, from the private sector as well as from within the Government\nitself.  Some  of  the  objectionable  provisions  cited  include  broadening  the  scope  of  price\nregulation (seen as a form of price control), exemption of the state sector from the policy, and\nclarification of the role of the CPA, particularly with respect to other regulatory authorities. To\nbreak the impasse and build ownership, ADB recommended a working committee to be set up\nwhere all parties to be affected by the proposed legislation be represented to draft legislation\nthat appropriately reflects their views. The committee will be chaired by the MIICF and comprise\nrepresentatives from the private sector, such as the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce; consumer\nsocieties, such as the Federation of Consumer Association of Sri Lanka; DIT and FTC; PERC;\nand the SEC.\n                                                          \n41TA 3110-SRI: Reengineering of Road Sector Institutions, for $640,000, approved on 8 December 1995.", "23\n91. While perfecting the current draft laws to conform with international best practices is\ndesirable, the establishment of an operational authority is clearly a more urgent priority given\nthat privatizations are already taking place at an accelerating pace. It is also important to\nmaintain the current momentum. The passage of the CPA bill as a legislative enactment is\ncritical in order to create the CPA by merging the functions and operations of the FTC and DIT42\nand  the  establishment  of  a  consumer  council  or  competition  tribunal,  as  initial  steps.\nSubsequently, the Government will operationalize the new entity with appropriate staffing and\nbudget.  One  of  the  principal  tasks  of  the  CPA  would  then  be  to  identify  specific  issues\nconcerning competition policy and consumer protection that arise in the Sri Lankan context and\nnecessitate legislative and regulatory reform, taking into consideration cultural and constitutional\nimperatives and best practices. The CPA will also address the question of institutional structure\nin terms of how competition policy and consumer protection can be efficiently and effectively\nenforced, guided by the earlier ADB TA study. Part of the CPA capacity building and advice on\nbest practices will be provided through the proposed ADB TA on Governance and Institutional\nSupport for Private Sector Development, to be attached to the PSDP.\n92. To promote transparency and enhance the public-private interface, MOFP agreed to\ncoordinate and ensure appropriate consultation by Government ministries with the private sector\nin preparing legislation and discussing issues affecting private sector activities. Exposure drafts\nwill be developed; working committees will include private sector representatives; and formal\nmeetings will be called to ensure dialogue, and to strengthen existing institutional mechanisms\nfor consultation.\n93. As  part  of  the  process  of  leveling  the  playing  field  and  strengthening  domestic\ncompetition, a study will be initiated with proposed ADB assistance43 to rationalize the present\nsystem of tax incentives, with due consideration for regional practices and the effectiveness of\ncurrent incentives. The goal is to gradually replace the present tax holidays for exporters with a\n15 percent flat income tax rate for exporters.\n4.  Labor Market Rigidities\n94. The adverse effects of an inflexible labor market are well-known in Sri Lanka, yet this\nissue has proven intractable. Because of the adverse effects of an inflexible labor market on\ninvestment  in  labor,  productivity,  and  a  more  rapid  Government  liberalization  of  protected\nindustries and infrastructure, the Government is placing a high priority on resolving labor market\nissues.\n95. Consequently, the PSDP seeks to establish a common ground with the labor unions,\nemployers,  and  the  Government  in  adopting  defined  criteria  and  a  standard  formula  to\ndetermine compensation for involuntary termination. This is intended to eliminate arbitrariness;\nuncertainty; and protracted, often bitter, labor negotiations.44 All parties appear to be in favor of\nthis approach and ADB support would be valuable to this process. To facilitate the process and\nin response to the need for a formal concensus, a working committee will be established,\ncomposed  of  representatives  of  employers,  labor  unions,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  and  labor\nexperts, to determine and recommend the uniform criteria, bases, and formula for compensation\nfor involuntary worker separation. The Government will conduct widespread consultation with\n                                                          \n42Many countries have adopted a similar structure, including Australia, Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom.\n43  Proposed TA on Trade Promotion is included in the 2001 country assistance program for Sri Lanka.\n44That the approval of the commissioner of labor should not be sought under the given circumstances is in keeping\nwith the practice in the US, the European Union and also elsewhere in Asia. When state intervention is required,\nthis is often confined to determining whether substantive justification exists for the proposed management action,\ne.g., retrenchment.", "24\nlabor  unions  and  employers  recognizing  that  the  quality  of  the  consultation  process  will\nultimately determine the durableness of proposed reform. To give legal force to the agreed\nformulation, the reform will be incorporated in appropriate legislation.\n96. TEWA has effectively served as the social safety net for workers and it has passed on\nthe burden to employers. To correct this anomaly, the PSDP supports establishing a social\nsafety net for workers, and in the short run, assisting with job counseling, placement, and\nretraining of displaced workers. One option is to integrate the proposed social safety net with\nthe  Skills  Development  Fund  Limited  (SDFL)  which  was  set  up  with  an  SLRs100  million\ninvestment by the Government in 1999. Counterpart investments of SLRs1 million have already\nbeen committed to SDFL by the Employers Federation of Ceylon. Other private investors are to\nbe invited to participate. The investment income from the contributed funds will be utilized for\nthe operation of SDFL. The main activities of SDFL include providing training needs assessment\nto employees and designing training programs to suit their needs; organizing and conducting\ntraining programs at state and enterprise levels, including retraining and skills upgrading, to\ndevelop a highly skilled workforce; maintaining computer databases and web servers for job-\nrelated information; and providing linkages between training institutions and the private sector.\nThe  principal  targets  of  SDFL  are  entry-level  employees  and  employees  already  in  the\nworkforce.  A  pilot  program  funded  by  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and\nInternational Labour Organisation demonstrated the usefulness of SDFL to employees. Several\ntraining programs were undertaken ranging from basic engineering technology skills transfer\nprograms  for  operational  and  supervisory  employees  to  managerial  skills  development\nprograms targeting middle and junior executives from the private sector. About 350 persons\nwere trained; employers covered the costs. The social safety net could be incorporated with\nSDFL by simply expanding the SDFL\u2019s scope of operations to include displaced workers, and\njob counseling and placement. Counterpart funds from the PSDP loans could be utilized as\nadditional capital; other sources, including the private sector, may also be tapped. Moreover, the\nsocial safety net could operate on a cost recovery basis by charging appropriate fees for\nworkers that find suitable employment, e.g., one-month salary, which is the practice of some\nprivate employment agencies. To insulate it from outside interference, management can be\noutsourced to a private sector agency using a performance contract, appropriate selection\nqualification criteria, and transparent, competitive bidding. The Government has requested ADB\nassistance in designing the proposed social safety net.\n97. Over the longer term, only a formal social security system that provides specific welfare\nbenefits and insurance for displaced workers can assuage the uncertainty and  apprehension\nover job loss. The Government should seriously consider developing a comprehensive but\nsustainable social security system.\n98. The lack of effective labor market mechanisms and weak capacity of the present system\nto  settle  labor  disputes  are  root  causes  of  labor  agitation.  Currently,  labor  disputes  are\nsubmitted to the Ministry of Labor for conciliation. Conciliation is undertaken by labor officials,\nwho are usually few in number and undertrained. When conciliation fails, the labor dispute is\nsubmitted for arbitration. A panel of arbitrators, outside the Ministry of Labor, are typically\nappointed for a fixed period. Under the Industrial Disputes Act, recourse is through the labor\ntribunals, which are part of the Ministry of Justice. The tribunals are clogged with labor cases\nawaiting  resolution.  Undue  concentration  is  focused  on  the  legal  aspects  of  labor  cases,\nparticularly, in looking for precedents, rather than for ways of settling the dispute. The result is\nthat labor cases take an inordinate amount of time.\n99. Consequently, to facilitate the settlement of labor disputes and to promote industrial\nharmony, the PSDP will strengthen the process of dispute resolution. The Ministry of Labor will", "25\nstrengthen the current system of arbitration by defining the bases for selection of the panel of\narbitrators  in  accordance  with  objective  qualification  criteria  under  appropriate  regulation,\nrequiring appointed arbitrators to undergo basic training in labor arbitration.\n100. An initiative currently under way, spearheaded by the Employers\u2019 Federation of Ceylon,\nis using mediation to settle labor disputes. Under the International Executive Service Corps and\nUSAID  Technology  Initiative  for  the  Private  Sector,  a  voluntary  executive  has  conducted\nmediation workshops to train mediators for, and obtain commitment for mediation from, private\ncompanies  with  the  participation  of  labor  unions.  As  a  result,  the  Employment  Mediation\nServices Centre was set up to resolve employment related disputes. Any employee or union, on\nbehalf of a member or employer, may request mediation to resolve a dispute or impending\ndispute to be conducted by trained mediators. The Ministry of Justice has attained a relatively\nhigh degree of success in achieving dispute settlements in civil cases through mediation, and\nhas over 5,000 mediators across the country. To support the process, TA is to be provided\nunder the PSDP to build mediation capacity at the Employment Mediation Services Centre and\ntrain trainers for labor conciliation and arbitration at the Ministry of Labor.\n5.  Access to Finance\n101. Improved access to financing and capital by the private sector depends largely upon the\nsuccess of the fiscal consolidation effort by the Government and reduction of crowding out\neffects  of  Government  borrowings  in  the  market,  the  increased  efficiency  of  financial\nintermediation in Sri Lanka, and development of the domestic capital market.\n102. While remaining relatively high, the budget deficit was contained to 7.5 percent 45 in\n1999 from a peak of 10.1 in the last five years (Supplementary Appendix G shows Sri Lanka\u2019s\nfiscal accounts). Public dissaving (the difference between Government revenues and current\nexpenditures, representing the deficit financing required by the Government, which effectively\nreduces savings in the system available to the private sector) has been reduced from a high of\n3.9 percent to 1.0 percent over the same period (Supplementary Appendix H presents savings\nand  investments  information  for  1995-1999).  In  its  recent  budget  pronouncement,  the\nGovernment committed to continue its fiscal consolidation effort and reduce the fiscal deficit to\n5.0 percent by 2002. As part of its medium-term strategy, the Government is limiting domestic\nborrowings to release more resources for productive use by the private sector.\n103. As the Government reduces its public borrowings, it can assuage the crowding out of\nprivate sector borrowers by eliminating distortions in the pricing of Government issues and\npromoting competition in the funds market. The Government intends to progressively replace\nnonmarketable  rupee  loans  with  Treasury  bonds.  However  this  can  be  achieved  only  by\naccelerating the development of the Government securities market (para. 49). In 1992, the\nGovernment  appointed  11  accredited  primary  dealers  in  Government  securities.  This  was\nincreased to 18 in 1997. The primary dealers are provided privileged access to auctions of\nGovernment securities in return for making markets for these securities. To strengthen the\nsystem, CBSL has required that all primary dealers be established as separate dedicated\nentities with capitalization of SLRs150 million. Moreover, the present over-the-telephone market\nis to be replaced by the formal listing and trading of Government securities at the CSE. With the\nhigher required capitalization, the number of primary dealers was reduced to 8. To facilitate\nsecondary  market  trading,  the  Government  is  preparing  to  automate  the  present  system,\n                                                          \n45 The budget deficit is expected to widen in 2000 although at a level still below the 1998 results due to the\nintensification of the conflict beginning in April 2000.", "26\nincluding the clearing and settlement of Government securities and move into scripless form.46\nThe World Bank financed the study on the introduction of an electronic payments system, an\non-line general ledger and accounting system, central depository, funds and securities transfers,\nand trading system for scripless Government securities. The Government also enhanced the\nfeatures of Treasury bonds by making them eligible as liquid assets of commercial and other\nspecialized banks, and for repurchase, discount, and rediscount operations with CBSL.\n104. However, while the major buyers of Government debt instruments are also Government-\nowned and controlled financial institutions, the process is not likely to be viewed as being even\nand  impartial.  Consequently,  the  PSDP,  using  several  initiatives,  will  seek  to  liberalize\ninvestments  by  the  major  Government-owned  and  administered  financial  institutions,  and\nimprove access to their funds by the private sector.\n105. The two large state commercial banks, BOC and PB, will be restructured according to a\nplan prepared by external consultants47 and approved by the Government. As a first step, the\nGovernment will institutionalize a corporate governance framework in both BOC and PB to\nensure the autonomy of the boards of directors and management of both state banks and\nmechanisms  for  effective  enforcement.  Management  is  now  being  gradually  transferred  to\nprivate  individuals.  In  the  case  of  BOC,  a  chief  financial  officer  (CFO)  is  being  recruited\ninternationally, with an advertisement in a major international publication. This was a major\nconcession by the labor union. The chief financial officer will be reporting to the chairperson in\nparallel with the chief operating officer. In the case of PB, all principal officers are now to be\nrecruited internationally, starting with the chief executive officer .\n106. The operations of both banks will be rationalized, to ensure that appropriate competition\npolicy is followed. The restructuring plan will (i) define measures for restoring and strengthening\nthe soundness of both banks and for improving their operational efficiencies; (ii) map out\nstrategic  and  corporate  business  plans  defining  their  strategic  objectives;  (iii)  lay  out  a\nperformance and accountability framework; a system of credit and recovery management; and a\nprogram  for  cost  reduction,  productivity  improvement,  and  branch  rationalization;  and  (iv)\nidentify measures for staffing and deployment,48 and recommendations for improving human\nresource  policies  and  practices.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  a  timebound\nmonitorable action plan to undertake restructuring of BOC and PB, substantially as described.\nSubsequently, a financial plan will be prepared for both BOC and PB, and the Government will\nconsider the feasibility of allowing private sector entry into BOC by offering employee stock\noptions and possible listing through the CSE. A majority of BOC employees are scheduled to\nreach retirement age starting in 2003. After the recruitment of private management, PB\u2019s role\nwill be redefined to emphasize operations in areas not otherwise served by the private sector.\nAny attempt at outright privatization is likely to lead to confrontation that could derail the reform\nprocess based on past experience. The Government has agreed that it will adopt a hard budget\nfor both state banks after completing the restructuring.\n107. In line with the restructuring of the two major state commercial banks, the Government is\nto seriously consider the future role of NSB in the financial system. NSB currently duplicates the\noperations of BOC and PB, which both have the capability to mobilize deposits and invest in\nGovernment issues. However, NSB also acts as a captive finance institution through which the\nGovernment can raise finance on short notice and at administered market rates: NSB can fix\ndeposit rates while the Government can influence the rates at which it borrows from NSB. The\n                                                          \n46Transfer by electronic entry. Preparatory work on the procedures, system design, and development of computer\nsoftware has been completed and testing of the system has begun.\n47Price Waterhouse Coopers for BOC and Ernst & Young for PB.\n48Part of the recommendation is to eliminate excess staff using an early voluntary retirement scheme.", "27\nGovernment will prepare a strategic plan to define the options for NSB, such as possible\nprivatization or merging its operations with the state commercial banks.\n108. In the interim, the PSDP will seek to gradually reduce Government intervention in NSB\nby strengthening the autonomy of NSB\u2019s board of directors, and requiring that at least 50\npercent of the board be from the private sector and management be recruited on the basis of a\ncompetitive process overseen by the board. The competitive advantage of NSB is its deposit\nbase, which it has built by combining high deposit rates with a Government guarantee. The\nGovernment has simply been recapitalizing NSB for losses incurred from negative differentials\nbetween its deposits and investment operations consisting of loans to the Government and\nGovernment  securities.  To  level  the  playing  field  and  rationalize  NSB\u2019s  operations,  the\nGovernment guarantee on NSB deposits will be gradually withdrawn at the same time as the\nmandatory requirement for NSB to invest in Government securities is lifted. CBSL will introduce\nan explicit deposit insurance scheme for all banks to protect small depositors. Furthermore, the\nGovernment will commit to discontinue any form of capital or special (not otherwise available to\nall other banking institutions) funding support for NSB.\n109. For  contractual  savings,  the  Government  has  committed  to  liberalize  the  insurance\nindustry and investments of the provident fund schemes, EPF and ETF under the PSDP. The\nRegulation  of  Insurance  Industry  Act  was  passed  by  Parliament.  The  act  reduces  the\nrequirement for mandated investment in Government securities from 50 percent to 30 percent\nfor life insurance companies, and from 30 to 20 percent for non-life insurance companies;\neliminates the mandatory reinsurance cession to NIC; allows insurance companies to reinsure\nwith international reinsurers without the need for prior Government approval; and permits up to\n90 percent direct foreign ownership of insurance companies. Although less critical due to the\nopening up of entry into the insurance industry, the Government plans to gradually divest its\nholdings in NIC and SLIC. In parallel with liberalization, a regulatory agency is being established\nto regulate and supervise the operations of insurance companies. A director-general is being\nrecruited  internationally  for  the  Insurance  Board.  A  World  Bank  TA  is  reviewing  existing\nlegislation  and  regulations,  designing  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework,  identifying  the\nrequirements and needs of the proposed regulatory agency, and preparing a detailed action\nplan for its establishment. ADB has been asked to assist the operationalization of the regulatory\nauthority.\n110. For  the  pension  and  provident  funds,  the  Government  will  need  to  adopt  a\ncomprehensive strategy to restructure the present system, and formulate an overall plan of\nreform to strengthen fund management in order to improve fund yields, diversify investments to\ninclude private securities, extend coverage, strengthen administration, and rationalize taxation.\nAmong the options to be considered are (i) the privatization of fund management that can be\nentrusted to outside fund managers through an appropriate accreditation system; (ii) the extent\nof liberalization to which funds may invest in private securities and the investment grade limits\nfor such investments; (iii) the possibility of investing funds in the international equity and debt\nmarkets in view of limited investment opportunities in the domestic market; (iv) approaches to\nwiden coverage to provide access to the poor; and (v) the possibility of centralizing collections\nand  disbursements  as  well  as  accounting  for  EPF  and  ETF  to  improve  efficiency  of\nadministration. The development finance institutions have large requirements that are currently\nbeing  sourced  principally  from  multilateral  financing  agencies.  Contractual  savings  could\nappropriately be used to finance part of the long-term requirement for development projects\nsubject to appropriate risk mitigation. As a first step, a superannuation benefits funds regulatory\ncommission  bill  is  under  preparation  and  will  be  introduced  in  Parliament.  The  regulatory", "28\ncommission,49 once formed, will then undertake reform of the present system. ADB assistance\nhas been requested to prepare the reform plan. This will be coordinated with ongoing support\nfrom the World Bank. The World Bank has provided substantial support to the Government in\nthis area, including an investment management study for EPF, TA for the regulatory reform of\nthe private provident funds, training at a pension workshop at Harvard University, and a pension\nseminar organized in Colombo.\n111. To promote stability in the securities markets, governance will be improved with the\nimmediate introduction of amendments to the SEC Act to include broadening SEC\u2019s jurisdiction\nto cover other market players, such as, securities underwriters, and investment managers, and\nincreasing its investigative powers. Further strengthening of existing legislation will however be\nneeded as the legislation about to be presented to Parliament does not address SEC\u2019s lack of\njurisdiction over financial advisers, commercial paper issuance and trading, use of repurchase\nagreements, and unlisted securities. Moreover, SEC\u2019s enforcement powers must be enhanced\nfor the watchdog agency to effectively discharge its functions. Under the present arrangement,\nSEC can only investigate and prosecute through the regular courts. It cannot penalize nor\nimpose administrative sanctions. Finally, the scope of authority of financial market regulators\nmust be clearly demarcated to ensure proper coordination of financial market regulation and\nsupervision. For example, the Government is currently moving to bring merchant banks under\nthe CBSL supervision, not SEC supervision.\n112. Measures to broaden and deepen the capital market have been undertaken by opening\nup the industry to foreign participation, such as, the mutual funds and securities brokerage\nindustry, and further measures are to be undertaken by allowing and providing for appropriate\nregulation for the introduction of new instruments and mechanisms such as derivatives for\nhedging purposes, margin lending, stock borrowing, and lending, essentially, to allow short-\nselling.\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n1.  Social Impact\n113. The social impact of privatization in Sri Lanka is mitigated through voluntary retirement\nschemes promoted at the preprivatization stage. These schemes have been offered to all\nemployees but are not subject to any fixed formula and vary depending on negotiations with the\nlabor unions. The PERC and the labor commissioner are believed to be involved in these\nsettlements. Average retrenchment compensation is estimated to have gone up from 45 to 53\nmonths\u2019 salary, excluding amounts payable under welfare benefit schemes and the accelerated\nwithdrawal  of  EPF  benefits  from  1991  to  1997.  Without  the  threat  of  dismissal,  voluntary\nretirement costs have increased. As a matter of policy, the Government is to distribute 10\npercent of the outstanding shares of its corporatized companies to employees at the time of\npartial divestment or privatization. In practice, this varies from 3 to 10 percent depending upon\nthe relative value of the companies and the number of employees involved. In this regard, Sri\nLanka has one of the most generous schemes for promoting worker participation and ownership\nin the world. Nonetheless, to ensure that due diligence is carried out for the voluntary retirement\nof workers in public enterprises to be divested under the PSDP, plans for voluntary retirement\nare required to be submitted to ADB prior to actual divestment.\n                                                          \n49 The merger of the Insurance Board with the proposed Superannuation Benefits Funds Regulatory Commission, at\nthe suggestion of the World Bank, is under consideration.", "29\n114. Flexible labor markets tend to have more beneficial effects on employment generation.\nThe difficulty and costs associated with laying off workers in Sri Lanka act as a deterrent to\nemployment generation, leading instead to widespread evasion, and employers resorting to\novertime, subcontracting, and use of casual labor. The moral hazard of TEWA protection can\nalso  promote  inefficiency  and  lower  worker  productivity  with  negative  impact  on  industrial\ngrowth.  Instead  of  abetting  excess  labor,  flexible  labor  markets  allow  such  labor  to  be\nredeployed in high-demand industries provided mechanisms are in place for skills development,\nretraining,  and  job  placement.  Furthermore,  social  protection  is  better  addressed  through\nsustainable and comprehensive social security systems, such as unemployment insurance, that\nthe Government may need to develop in the long-term. The poverty impact assessment is\nshown in Appendix 5.\n2.  Environmental Impact\n115. Infrastructure and industrial projects transferred to the private sector may have direct\nenvironmental  impacts.  (Supplementary  Appendix  I  contains  the  matrix  of  potential\nenvironmental impacts of policy actions under the PSDP). However, Sri Lanka has adequate\nlegal  and  institutional  structures  for  environmental  protection.  Under  the  present  law,  the\nNational  Environmental  Act  of  1980  (as  amended),  environmental  assessment  is  legally\nrequired for a range of development projects that are gazetted. This applies to all prescribed\nprojects irrespective of who undertakes the project, whether it is the Government, a local\nauthority, or the private sector. Based on Government procedures any activity that falls within\nthe domain of a prescribed project is subject to an environmental impact assessment (EIA). A\nproject approving agency, line ministry or agency, is designated to approve or disapprove an\nEIA with the concurrence of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), which is the regulatory\nand enforcement agency for the environment. Where the project proponent is also the project\napproving agency, the CEA will appoint another appropriate agency. In addition, the Coast\nConservation Act of 1981 specifies that an EIA be conducted for projects located in the coastal\nzones. Once approval is granted and the project implemented, an environmental protection\nlicense is required before the project can commence operation. This license, given by the CEA\nand renewed annually, is subject to the maintenance of quality standards; if standards are not\nmet, the CEA can cancel the license or, in extreme cases, close down the industry.\n116. An overall review of environmental compliance will be conducted by ADB in consultation\nwith the Executing Agency, and the CEA. The environmental aspects of operations of privatized\npublic enterprises, private infrastructure, and industrial projects that result from the PSDP will be\nexamined during PSDP implementation. As specified in the National Environmental Act, an EIA\nshould be undertaken before the prescribed projects are implemented, and the environmental\nprotection license obtained prior to commencing operations and thereafter renewed annually.\nThe foregoing regulations are to be complied with by the entities covered under the PSDP.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA.  Amount of Loans and Sources of Funds\n117. Under  Subprogram  I  of  the  PSDP,  two  ADB  loans  are  proposed:  (i)  $85  million\nequivalent  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  (ii)  $15  million  from  ordinary  capital\nresources. The use of ADF resources is justified by the poverty impact of promoting private\nsector development. Poverty reduction will result from improving access of the poor to goods\nand finance arising from more competitive markets, freeing up of public resources for social\nexpenditures and welfare benefits, providing more balanced treatment of the poor as a result of\nenhanced  governance  and  public  accountability,  and  greater  employment  as  well  as", "30\nentrepreneurial opportunities. Because of the uncertain security situation and high level of public\ndebt, caution is also to be exercised to avoid adding pressure to the public budget or placing\nadditional demands that may disrupt economic stability and growth. The World Bank continues\nto  provide  financial  support  to  Sri  Lanka  from  its  concessional  International  Development\nAssociation window.\n118. Subsequently, depending upon implementation progress of Subprogram I, a satisfactory\nreassessment of the macroeconomic conditions, the status of proposed policy reform actions,\nand the readiness of the Government to undertake the proposed reforms, Subprogam II will be\npresented for Board consideration. Proposed ADB funding is expected to include two loans: (i)\n$35 million from ADF and (ii) $15 million from OCR, under terms and conditions as prescribed\nby ADB and approved by the Board.\n119. The proposed loans will finance the costs of adjustment arising from the reforms and are\njustified by the breadth and far-reaching impact of the proposed reforms. While it is not possible\nto determine with absolute preciseness the expected costs of the reforms, broad estimates are\nprovided in the following Table .\n Estimated Costs of Adjustment of the PSDP\n($ million)\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 Total\nPERC Restructuring-Related Operating Cost 1.3      1.4  1.2 1.1    5.0\nEnterprise Restructuring   68.0    52.0 109.0  42.0 271.0\nVoluntary Retirement of Workers for PEs for Divestment   83.0  133.0 123.0  56.0 395.0\nBII Operating Cost    1.0  1.1 1.2     3.3\nConsumer Protection Authority Establishment and Operating Cost    0.5  0.5 0.5     1.5\nInsurance Board Establishment and Operating Cost    0.5  0.5 0.5     1.5\nPrivate Superannuation Benefits Funds Regulatory Commission    0.5  0.5 0.5     1.5\nEstablishment and Operating Cost\nSupport for Social Safety Net Fund (or Skills Development Fund)  10.2  4.6 2.5   17.3\nCost for Formulating Restructuring Plans for State Banks    2.0  2.0 2.0     6.0\nCost for Establishing of Deposit Insurance Scheme 0.0  0.0 \u2014     0.0\nCost of Government Shift from Direct Borrowing to Market-Based  67.5 67.5 67.5 202.5\nInstruments\nTotal  152.3 268.6  309.9 173.8  904.6\n\u2014 = not calculated, BII = Bureau of Infrastructure and Investment, PE = public enterprises, PERC = Public Enterprises\nReform Commission, PSDP = Private Sector Development Program\nSource: PERC, ADB consultants, and staff estimates.\n1.  Voluntary Retirements\n120. Currently, there are about 165,000 public enterprise employees. The estimated level of\noverstaffing, including possible closures of public enterprises, is about 42.5 percent. Using the\nhistorical average cost of voluntary retirement compensation paid by PERC of $4,500 per\nworker, plus a standard gratuity payment of one-half month per year of service that PERC\nestimates averages about $850 per worker plus a rough estimate of 10 percent contingency\nallowance, the gross cost of voluntary retirements would be close to $400 million. Such costs", "31\nwill have to be borne by the Government either as outright payments to retired employees or\nreflected as part of the effective sale price to private buyers.50\n2.  Enterprise Restructuring\n121. The cost of public enterprise restructuring prior to privatization can reach $271 million\nbased on PERC estimates. This is possible since for the state banks alone, BOC and PB, the\nestimated additional provisions and based on the World Bank study in 1998 would be about\nSLRs12.9 billion ($172.8 million).\n3.  Shift to Market-based Government Borrowings\n122. A move to eliminate distortions created by Government borrowings at below market\nrates will have a sizeable budgetary impact. At a minimum, this would raise the Government\u2019s\ncost of borrowing by about 2 percent, which is the estimated underpricing on rupee loans\ncompared  with  the  yields  on  T-bills.  Based  on  outstanding  rupee  loans  of  approximately\nSLRs252 billion, the additional cost would be about $67.5 million per annum. The additional cost\ncan rise further if the underpricing is based upon long-term bond yields and other long-term\nalternative investments.\n4.  Operating Costs and Other Related Costs of Reform\n123. Associated costs of operation of PERC, BII, and regulatory authorities required to be set\nup  under  the  PSDP,  the  costs  of  the  restructuring  plans  for  the  state  banks,  and  the\norganization costs of setting up the social safety net fund for displaced workers, are estimated\nto amount to about $31 million over the program period. This excludes the initial costs of setting\nup a deposit insurance scheme for small depositors.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n124. For the loans under Subprogram I of the PSDP, the ADF loan will have a repayment\nperiod of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry an interest rate of 1.0\npercent during the grace period and 1.5 percent during the amortization period. The OCR loan\nwill carry the pool-based variable lending rate applicable to ADB\u2019s US dollar facility, currently at\n6.5 percent per annum with a maturity period of 15 years and a grace period of 3 years. For the\nOCR loan, a flat commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum will be applied 60 days after\nloan signing on the unwithdrawn balance of the loan and a front-end fee equal to 1 percent of\nthe loan amount will be charged.\n125. The  loans  are  expected  to  be  utilized  within  25  months  from  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness. The proceeds of these loans may be used to finance eligible imports incurred\nwithin 180 days prior to the date of effectiveness.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n126. MOFP will be the Executing Agency for the PSDP and the National Planning Department\nof MOFP will be the Implementing Agency. A steering committee will be organized and chaired\n                                                          \n50It is still more beneficial to the Government in many cases to take a deep cut  in price or even losses from\ndivestments than keep the public enterprise. For instance, in the case of Mattegama Textile Mills (revested\ncompany), the Government estimated it had to inject more than SLRs400 million to upgrade the products of the\ncompany by modernizing its machinery to make it competitive. The company also had liabilities of SLRs320 million,\nwhich carried a high rate of interest. It also reported a loss of SLRs79 million over 10 months prior to its sale.", "32\nby the secretary, MOFP, to coordinate policy decisions concerning the PSDP. The steering\ncommittee will be composed of key officials from the ministries and agencies concerned such as\nthe  Ministry  of  Labor,  Ministry  of  Internal  and  International  Commerce  and  Food,  the\nInfrastructure  Ministries,  PERC,  BOI,  BII,  CBSL,  SEC,  provident  funds,  state  banks,  and\ninsurance  companies.  The  steering  committee  may  also  call  upon  affected  sectors  for\nconsultations,  such  as,  the  labor  unions,  the  employers  confederations,  nongovernment\norganizations, experts from academe, and the CSE.\nD.  Procurement and Disbursement\n127. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced\nand procured in ADB member countries (other than items specified in the negative list and\nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government will certify that the\nvolume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the\nloans for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and\nverify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The Government will open an account (the\nDeposit Account) at CBSL into which the proceeds of the loans will be deposited and through\nwhich all withdrawals will be made. Monthly statements of the Deposit account will be attached\nto the semi-annual report of PSDP implementation to be submitted to ADB (see para. 135).\nE.  Counterpart Funds\n128. The Government will utilize the local currency counterpart funds generated by the PSDP\nloans to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform and to help maintain\ncurrent levels of social expenditures.\nF.  Monitoring and Tranching\n1.  Tranching\na.  Subprogram I\n129. The loans for Subprogram I of the PSDP are to be released in three tranches: (i) $25\nmillion from ADF upon loan effectiveness; (ii) $25 million from ADF about 6 months from the first\ndisbursement subject to the fulfillment of specified second tranche conditions; and (iii) $50\nmillion ($35 million from ADF and $15 million from OCR) about 25 months from the first\ndisbursement subject to the fulfillment of specified third tranche conditions. The progress of\nimplementation of specified policy actions set out in the policy matrix will be reviewed by ADB\nwith the Government about  three months prior to the scheduled tranche release.

Tranching is\nstill to be decided. Policy actions for Subprogram II are subject to revision following ADB\u2019s\nreassessment of the macroeconomic environment, lessons learned in Subprogram I, and the\nstatus of implementation of and readiness of the Government to undertake the proposed policy\nreform actions.

Monitoring\n134.  ADB will closely monitor the progress of PSDP implementation and the impact of the\nreforms on private sector development in Sri Lanka. The Government and ADB will continue to\nengage in active policy dialogue throughout PSDP implementation that includes issues that may\naffect private sector development, sectoral policy concerns that adversely affect private sector\nentry and participation, and additional reforms that may be considered necessary or desirable\nfor the sustained development of the private sector. ADB will also give close attention to the\npoverty impact, particularly during the transition, of policy reforms through public expenditures\nfor costs of adjustments of the PSDP relating to adequate compensation and fair treatment for\nworkers who seek to voluntarily retire from public enterprises being privatized, establishment of\na  social  safety  net  to  assist  displaced  workers,  as  well  as  the  maintenance  of  social\nexpenditures for health and education. The Government will make available the necessary\ninformation for ADB to be able to conduct a public expenditure review to ascertain that these\npolicies are being implemented.\n135.  The Government will provide ADB with semiannual reports on PSDP implementation, in\nparticular on policy actions set out in the development policy letter (policy matrix), and on the\naccomplishment of PSDP objectives. Such reports will be submitted in such form and in such\ndetail and within such period as the ADB may reasonably request, and must include, progress\nmade and problems encountered during the six months in review, steps taken or proposed to be\ntaken to remedy problems encountered, the proposed detailed activity for PSDP implementation\nand expected progress during the next six months. On completion of the PSDP, but in any event\nnot later than 6 months, the Government will prepare and furnish to ADB a comprehensive\nreport on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented.\nVII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n136.  The PSDP covers areas that the Government will be pursuing for the first time as new\nareas are opened for private sector activity. Accordingly, the Government has sought ADB\u2019s\nassistance in areas where it deems additional support may be required to effectively implement\ncertain policy reform actions. IMF also indicated specific areas where assistance is urgently\nneeded and where ADB assistance would be best targeted.", "38\n137.  Since private sector development will impact on almost all sectors, it is important to build\nconsensus  and  a  sense  of  ownership  for  the  proposed  reforms.  Accordingly,  ADB  will\nparticipate  in  stakeholder  conferences  at  the  invitation  of  the  IMF,  that  will  discuss  the\nGovernment\u2019s Vision for 2010. A cross-section of the country will be invited to participate and\ndiscuss Sri Lanka\u2019s future and the way forward, including private sector development and\nrelated policy reforms. With the transfer of ownership of key institutions to the private sector and\nthe commercialization of operations of public enterprises, a corporate governance framework\nwill be developed and used in public and private companies. Capacity building for the new\nregulatory authorities will also be essential to ensure that the reforms are effectively carried out\nand become sustainable. Finally, on labor reforms, Government has sought ADB assistance in\nsetting up the social safety net for displaced workers and to provide capacity building for dispute\nresolution.\n138.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,650,000 equivalent, comprising $2,155,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $1,495,000 in equivalent local currency costs. ADB will provide\n$1,900,000.00 to cover foreign exchange costs of $1,425,000 and part of the local currency cost\nequivalent to $475,000. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Swedish International Development\nCooperation Agency (SIDA) will provide, on a parallel basis, a total grant of $1,000,000 that will\ncover $730,000 of foreign exchange cost and $270,000 of local currency cost. The balance in\nlocal currency cost will be provided by the Government.\n139.  For the ADB TA, international and domestic consultants will be engaged to form a team\nto implement the TA. The consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. An estimated total of 60 person-months of consulting services will be\nrequired,  including  39  person-months  of  international  and  21  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting services. TA components are expected to begin in March 2001 and completed by\nSeptember 2002. For the SIDA TA, an estimated total of 20 person-months of international\nconsultancy services will be required. The description of the TA is provided in Appendix 6.\nVIII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Benefits\n140.  There is broad consensus that the future development of Sri Lanka hinges on resolving\nthe civil conflict and attaining a higher growth regime. Only through higher and sustained growth\ncan  the  country  create  jobs,  raise  standards  of  living,  maintain  high  levels  of  human\ndevelopment, and reduce poverty. However, the transition to a higher and sustained growth\nregime  will  require  generating  more  savings  and  investments,  and  increasing  Sri  Lanka\u2019s\ncompetitiveness.51 This can only be delivered by a responsive and dynamic private sector\noperating within a stable and competitive market.\n141.  The PSDP, which supports private sector development, will assist the Government meet\nits development objectives. It will encourage greater private sector activity, facilitate private\nsector entry and participation, and open up areas of investment until now reserved for the public\nsector. It will help eliminate market distortions that impede the growth of the private sector and\npromote a policy environment that will enable a market to operate that is conducive to private\n                                                          \n51 Sustainable increases in productivity resulting in the improvement of the standard of living of the average citizen of\na country.", "39\nsector  initiative.  It  will  promote  economic  efficiency  by  transferring  the  management  of\nproductive assets to the private sector operating along commercial lines and subject to the\ndiscipline  imposed  by  competitive  markets.  It  will  promote  parallel  efficiency  in  public\nadministration by rationalizing the Government\u2019s role among public enterprises and by instituting\nprinciples of good governance among these enterprises. It will ensure fair competition through\nthe  adoption  and  enforcement  of  an  appropriate  competition  policy,  and  through  effective\ncompetition encourage technological innovation. It will increase incentives for job creation and\nimprove  labor  productivity.  It  will  help  free  up  resources  and  facilitate  access  by  private\nentrepreneurs to domestic sources of financing and capital.\nB.  Risks\n142.  The most significant risk is the continuing civil conflict in the northeast or in the worst\ncase, the spread of the conflict. Under this scenario, reform will be difficult for the Government\nto pursue and will likely delay reforms. Thus far, given the present level of the current conflict\nand the limited military operation geographically, the country has been able to pursue its reform\nprograms and infrastructure projects, except where there is active military engagement. The\nGovernment is nonetheless taking concrete steps to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nMore power is being devolved to Tamil-majority regions, Norwegian assistance for negotiating a\npeaceful settlement of the conflict has been mobilized, and relief and rehabilitation of affected\npeople, for which ADB assistance has been sought, is being addressed. The Government is\ncommitted to maintain current levels of social expenditures, in health and education.\n143.  A change in the composition of Government can also pose a risk in terms of a policy\nshift. However, it is not likely a dramatic change in policies or a reversal to past policies will\noccur. The previous change in Government did not significantly alter the broad macroeconomic\nand market policy orientation. Moreover, there appears to be broad consensus and support for\ncurrent liberalization measures and a private sector-led strategy.\n144.  Another risk is lack of political will to carry out the reforms, inasmuch as the PSDP\ncovers a number of politically sensitive areas, including, labor issues, privatizations of public\nenterprises,  and  restructuring  of  the  state  banks.  However,  the  Government  has  been\nsuccessful in overcoming resistance in these areas, with large privatizations in industry and\nopening up of selected infrastructure sectors as well as divestments in plantations. Moreover, in\nboth labor and restructuring of the state banks, there has been substantive preparatory work\nundertaken, although consensus building is not easily achieved.\n145.  Lack of capacity to undertake specific reforms is another risk. However, a TA is being\nprovided that is specifically targeted to address weaknesses identified, together with the IMF, of\nprogram implementation in Sri Lanka.\nIX.  ASSURANCES\n146.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement\nas described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix will continue\nto be in effect for at least the duration of the PSDP.\n(ii)  The Government will adopt the other policies and actions included in the PSDP\nand specified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix in a timely", "40\nmanner and will ensure that the policies and actions continue to be in effect for at\nleast the duration of the PSDP.\n(iii)  The Government will maintain social expenditures, particularly for health and\neducation, at least at current levels.\n(iv)  The Government will ensure that public and private sector entities covered under\nthe PSDP comply with all applicable environmental regulations, and in particular\nwith the provisions of the National Environmental Act of 1980, as amended.\nX.

This letter spells out the objectives of the\nGovernment\u2019s Program, its scope and main elements.\nA. Development Objectives, Strategy and Plans\nThe challenges facing Sri Lanka are, on the main, twofold, to seek a just and\nlasting peace in the country and to raise the level of economic growth on a sustained\nbasis in order to meet the country\u2019s development objectives.\nThe Government has waged a campaign seeking a speedy resolution of the civil\nconflict,  on  one  hand,  through  domestic  and  international  isolation  of  the  terrorist\nelements involved in the current conflict, and on the other, through persuasive measures\nto win over the peaceful majority by ensuring equal rights for all communities and\nimproved sharing of political power through constitutional change. The Government has\nalso sought bilateral assistance in seeking a mediated settlement to the conflict. Relief\nand rehabilitation of the affected population is being addressed and in this regard, an\nemergency loan has been requested from the ADB. The Government is committed to\ncontain spending for defense outlays and protecting social expenditures, particularly for\nhealth and education.\nSri Lanka has performed creditably in the last decade growing at an average\nannual rate of over 5 percent. I say creditably because such growth was achieved during\na period of internal strife and external turmoil that witnessed the Mexican crisis, the ruble\ncrisis  in  Russia,  and  the  financial  meltdown  in  East  Asia.  The  macroeconomy  has\nremained stable with inflation on the decline from a peak of about 16 percent in the last\nfive years to below 5 percent in 1999. Interest rates have consequently fallen. The\nexternal debt burden of the country has also steadily declined since 1995 with the\nexternal debt to GDP ratio falling from over 70 percent five years ago to just above 57\nper  cent  in  1999.    The  debt  service,  in  relation  to  the  country\u2019s  exports,  although\nminimally rising remains manageable at slightly above 15 percent.\nOver the immediate future, the outlook remains favorable with real economic\ngrowth expected to rise by 6 percent both in 2000 and  in 2001 with the overall recovery\nin world trade. A dramatic improvement in the economic scenario is possible should the\ncurrent conflict be resolved.\nHowever, the Government realizes that for the country to meet its development\nobjectives, it needs to transition to a higher  growth regime, and for this growth to be\nsustained, it needs to mobilize larger amounts of resources, become more efficient in the\nuse of such resources and to raise labor productivity. As public resources can only\nfinance  a  part  of  the  requirements  for  sustained  and  higher  growth,  to  boost  the\ncountry\u2019s competitiveness, would mean providing a greater role for the country\u2019s private\nsector as the main driver of the economy while shifting the role of  Government from", "Appendix 1, page 2\n43\nowning and operating the means of production to facilitating and regulating business\nactivity. At the same time, promoting efficient markets by strengthening competition and\nencouraging innovation.\nThe Government has conducted wide consultations on the proposed Program\nand  its  various  aspects  with  stakeholders,  Government  agencies  concerned  and\ncoordinated  with    the  international  donor  community,  including  among  others,  the\nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International\nCooperation and the International Labor Organization. A large amount of preparatory\nwork has also been undertaken over the years with the help of donors and outside\nconsultants to bring the Program to its current state.\n B. The Program\nConsequently, the Government has, with ADB assistance, finalized a plan of\naction to promote private-sector led development as the key component of its medium-\nterm economic strategy.\nThe  results  of  earlier  reforms  have  indicated  that  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  private  sector\nresponds positively to reforms. However, the country has failed to fully capitalize on past\nreforms  liberalizing  the  trade  and  industry  sectors  due  to  market  distortions  and\nimperfections of the market system that continue to constrain private sector activity.\nThese include inefficiencies in the large public enterprise sector, lack of competitive\nmarkets due to deficiencies in the policy framework and  weak incentive structure, labor\nmarket rigidities, and limited access to finance, particularly for long-term capital.\nThe Private Sector Development Program will thus address identified constraints\nto private sector activity and will have the following key objectives: (i) public enterprise\nreform  and  continued  reduction  in  Government  ownership  and  control  of  public\nenterprises engaged in commercial operations; (ii) develop the enabling environment for\nprivate  sector  participation  in  infrastructure;  (iii)  enhance  the  market  system  by\npromoting  fair  market  competition  and  the  appropriate  regulation  of  private  sector\nactivity; (iv) facilitate labor market mobility; and (v) improve access to funds.\n(i)  Public enterprise reform and reduction of  Government ownership and\ncontrol over public enterprises engaged in commercial operations\nThe Government is gradually encouraging private sector entry and participation\nin public enterprises engaged in commercial operations through its public enterprise\nreform program. The Government has relinquished ownership and/or control over 82\ncompanies since the early 1990\u2019s. The current program calls for the sale of Government\nshares both fully and partially in 42 more public enterprises.\nTo  complement  this  effort,  the  Government  will  also  seek  to  institutionalize\ncommercial  principles  into  the  operations  of  those  remaining  public  commercial\nenterprises that are not yet ready to be taken over by the private sector and will undergo\nrestructuring. A corporate governance framework will be adopted and enforced for these\npublic enterprises to promote transparency and  efficiency.\nHowever, far more important perhaps is the change in policy adopted by this\nGovernment  to  pursue  a  redefined  role  that  focuses  on  the  sectors  where  market\nmechanisms  do  not  as  yet  function  effectively  such  as  in  education,  health,  the\nenvironment, rural and small sectors, safety nets for the poor and social and cultural", "44\nAppendix 1, page 3\ndevelopment. This will ensure that the current effort to reform public enterprises will\nendure.\n(ii)  Developing an enabling environment for private sector participation in\ninfrastructure\nThe Government is also progressively liberalizing the country\u2019s infrastructure\nsectors.  It  is  promoting  private  and  foreign  participation  in  large  scale  commercial\ninfrastructure. The Bureau of Infrastructure Investments (BII) was established for the\npurpose of facilitating private and foreign investments in infrastructure. BII is currently\nstreamlining the approval process to cut down processing time and the integrity of the\nprocess is to be strengthened by providing an appeals mechanism for the immediate\nredress of investors\u2019 grievances.\nIn  parallel,  appropriate  legislative  changes  are    underway  to  establish\nindependent  regulatory  authorities  in  water  supply,  power  and  ports  that  will  have\nresponsibility for approving, licensing, and monitoring the operations of infrastructure\nprojects.  A  regulatory  authority  has  been  set  up  earlier  for  telecommunications.\nSubsequently,  the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  will  be  unbundled  into  generation,\ntransmission and distribution while the Colombo Port (Jaya Container Terminal) is to be\ncorporatized.  Airport  and  Aviation  Services  Ltd.  will  be  restructured  to  address  the\ninfrastructure  requirements  of  civil  aviation.  The  petroleum  industry  will  undergo\nderegulation beginning with marketing and distribution.\n(iii)  Competition policy and consumer protection\nFor Sri Lanka to benefit from increased private sector activity, the Government\nrecognizes  it  must,  on  one  hand,  foster  competition  to  enhance  efficiency,  raise\nproductivity and encourage innovation, and on the other hand, regulate private sector\nactivity to ensure investor and consumer rights are protected. The Government is thus\nstrengthening  competition  policy  and  consumer  protection  through  a  proposed\nConsumer Protection Authority Act. This proposed Act  has already undergone a round\nof consultations among concerned parties. However, it still needs further discussions\ndue to concerns that have been raised by certain sectors. To ensure that these concerns\nare  heard  and  given  due  consideration,  the  Government  has  formed  a  working\ncommittee where all parties to be affected by the proposed legislation are represented.\nThe recommendations of this working committee are then to form the basis for the draft\nlegislation that will be presented to Parliament.\nTo  enhance  public/private  partnership,  the  Government  is  promoting  greater\ntransparency in the dealings of all its Ministries and agencies with the private sector. To\nensure that appropriate consultation is carried out regarding legislation and important\nregulations and rules affecting the private sector coordination will be undertaken directly\nunder my office, the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP).\nFurthermore, to promote domestic competition, the Government is initiating a\nstudy with ADB assistance to review existing tax incentives with a view to adopting and\nimplementing a program rationalizing the present system of tax incentives with due\nregard for regional competitive practices.", "45\nAppendix 1, page 4\n(iv) Labor market mobility\nThe adverse effects of an inflexible labor market are well known. Present-day\nlabor laws need to be tailored to meet the demands of an open economy. Accordingly,\nthe Government has initiated the review of needed reforms in labor legislation under a\nproposed Employment and Industrial Relations Act. Of special concern in this regard, is\nthe need to reach agreement on a standard formula and uniform criteria for involuntary\nemployee separation. A working committee is thus to be formed to take up much needed\nlabor  market  reforms  to  be  composed  of  representatives  from    the  labor  unions,\nemployers,  the  Government,  and  labor  experts.  The  Government  recognizes  the\nimportance of this process and that the quality of consultations will ultimately determine\nthe durableness of the reforms. The recommendation of this working committee will\nbecome the basis for amending existing legislation.\nHowever, while voluntary or involuntary compensation will provide some relief to\nworkers, it does not assist workers find alternative gainful employment. Consequently,\nunder the Program, a social safety net will be set up with the objective of providing\ndisplaced workers with job counseling, job placement and retraining services. Over the\nlong-term,  a  social  security  system  that  will  provide  specific  welfare  benefits  and\ninsurance for displaced workers will be considered. The Government will weigh the costs\nand benefits of such a system and its possible design and structure.\n(v) Access to finance\nThe private sector requires financing to expand its operations at appropriate\nterms and rates. Such improved access to finance will depend largely on the ability of\nthe Government to rein in its budget deficits and in parallel, increasing the efficiency of\nfinancial intermediation and developing the domestic capital market.\nConsequently,  the  medium  term  fiscal  strategy  of  the  Government  calls  for\nraising public savings, containing the budget deficit, and reducing domestic borrowings\nin order to free more resources for the private sector. To reduce the impact of direct\nGovernment borrowings from the market, the Government is gradually shifting its direct\nborrowings from the state-owned financial institutions to the issuance of Government\nsecurities on market basis via an auction system administered by the Central Bank of Sri\nLanka (CBSL).\nFurthermore,  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  financial  intermediation,  the\nGovernment  is  slowly  phasing  out  privileges  accorded  to  state-owned  banking\ninstitutions to promote competition. Accordingly under the Program, for the National\nSavings Bank (NSB), the Government will gradually phase out its explicit guarantee on\nNSB deposits at the same time that the requirement for NSB to invest in Government\nsecurities is lifted. Instead, a deposit insurance scheme to protect small depositors will\nbe implemented for all banks by the CBSL. At the same time, the Bank of Ceylon (BOC)\nand People\u2019s Bank (PB) will be undergoing restructuring and will be made to operate in\naccordance with the corporate governance framework to be set up by the Government\nwith ADB assistance. A Memorandum of Understanding detailing the commitments of\nboth these banks have been signed with the Government and forms the basis for their\ncontinued operations.\nTo improve access to long-term funds by the private sector, the Government is\nalso committed to liberalize investments by the contractual savings institutions under an\nappropriate regulatory and supervisory framework. The new Insurance Act has already", "46\nAppendix 1, page 5\nbeen passed by Parliament. Domestic insurance companies have been opened up to\nforeign ownership of up to 90 percent. A Superannuation Benefits Funds Regulatory\nCommission Bill is currently being drafted to set up the regulatory framework and,\neventually pave the way for, the establishment of a regulatory authority for private\npension  and  provident  funds.  With  assistance  from  ADB    and  other  donors,  the\nGovernment will also undertake the reform of the private pension and provident funds\nsystem in Sri Lanka that will include a thorough review of investment policies and\nstrengthening of social protection. In conjunction with liberalization, the Securities and\nExchange  Commission  will  be  strengthened  and  provided  wider  regulatory  and\nsupervisory powers. The Government is also gradually dismantling the barriers to entry\ninto the country\u2019s financial markets. Domestic mutual funds have been opened up to\nforeign investment and  stock brokerage firms may now be wholly owned by foreign\ninvestors.\nC.  Other Program Aspects\nIn the implementation of the Program, while Sri Lanka has adequate laws to deal\nwith environmental matters, the Government will, nonetheless, take due care that any\nadverse environmental impact is properly mitigated. It will also ensure that the poor is\nnot adversely affected as a consequence of the Program. The Government's Framework\nfor  Poverty  Reduction  has  been  recently  completed.  Utmost  care  will  be  exercised\nparticularly in undertaking the voluntary retirement of workers from public enterprises\nwhere the Government is transferring control and/or ownership.\nTo ensure the smooth implementation of the Program, I have appointed the\nSecretary, MOFP, to form a Steering Committee, composed of all concerned Ministries,\nagencies and offices, that will coordinate policy reform actions that are to be taken under\nthe Program.\nD. The Government\u2019s Request\nThe Government with ADB assistance has crafted a Program that in its belief will\nmove this country forward. This Program has the highest commitment of Government\nand the Government is confident that it can carry out the proposed reforms and achieve\nthe objectives of the Program. Nonetheless, the Government is fully aware that this\nundertaking although clearly needed is fraught with difficulties and will be undertaken\nunder the cloud of the ongoing conflict. With the assistance of ADB and the international\ndonor community, the Government is prepared to forge ahead.\nConsequently, I trust that the ADB will consider favorably the Government\u2019s\nrequest for a loan of $100 million and technical assistance of $1.9 million to undertake\nSubProgram I of the Private Sector Development Program. I strongly urge the ADB to\nprovide a further loan of $100 million to pursue reforms envisaged in SubProgram II of\nthe Private Sector Development Program.\nYours sincerely,\n/s/\nMinister of Finance and Planning", "POLICY MATRIX\nObjectives Policy Actions Tentative Policy Actions\nSubProgram I SubProgram II\nFirst Tranche (end-2000) Second Tranche (June 2001) Third Tranche (end-2002) Beginning 20031\nI.

Introduction\n1. Sri Lanka\u2019s current population of about 19 to 20 million is growing at a rate of 1.2\npercent  annually  on  average  since  1990.  The  country's  social  conditions  compare\nfavorably with those of other South Asian countries. Life expectancy is about 72 years,\namong the highest in the region. The structure of the economy has changed, with about\none third of the labor force engaged in agriculture, while industry accounts for over 20\npercent of gross domestic product and 16 percent of employment, and the services\nsector accounting for over one half of GDP and 40 percent of employment. Per capita\nGDP is about $837.\n2. Despite the favorable social indicators, about 17.5 million of the population reside\nin seven of the country\u2019s nine provinces, and one fifth to one third of the population (3-5\nmillion) is categorized as poor based on a lower poverty line of SLRs860 and a higher\npoverty line of SLRs1,032  per person per month. According to the findings in the\nrecently  completed  Framework  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  Sri  Lanka,1  poverty  is\npredominantly a rural phenomenon in Sri Lanka, with over 85 percent of the poor in rural\nareas, 7 percent in urban areas, and 6 percent in the estate sector. Consumption\npoverty is estimated at over 33 percent in rural and estate sectors compared with 17\npercent  in  the  urban  sector  based  on  the  higher  poverty  line,  largely  a  result  of\ninadequate basic social and infrastructure services. The findings in the Framework for\nPoverty Reduction will be reinforced by the ongoing integrated household income and\nexpenditure survey by the Department of Census and Statistics to be completed by the\nend of 2000.\n3. Most of the poor are concentrated in the Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa, and\nSouthern provinces where agricultural growth has been sluggish and the expansion of\nnonfarm activities has been restricted by major infrastructure deficiencies especially\nroads, electricity, irrigation, and communication facilities. Malnutrition among children is\nalso prevalent in these provinces. In six of the seven surveyed provinces (excluding the\nNorthern and Eastern provinces), and with considerable variation among the provinces,\nabout 60-75 percent of the population have no access to electricity, about 27-48 percent\nhave no access to safe drinking water and over 20-34 percent lack access to safe\nsanitation.\n4. According to the 1981 census (latest available), about 2.8 million people or 15\npercent of the country\u2019s population live in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Although\nnot included in the national statistics on poverty, a considerable portion of the population\nis known to be experiencing deprivation in economic welfare, especially those in the\nnorthern area of the Northern province, which has been the center of the conflict. The\nongoing civil conflict in the north and east of the country has had a major impact on\npoverty. Although difficult to accurately quantify, the conflict has substantially disrupted\neconomic activity and over 5 percent of GDP is being used to finance the conflict. The\nconflict has caused much damage to physical and social infrastructure facilities including\nschool buildings and medical centers, as well as civilian property. In addition, it has led\n                                                \n1 The Framework for Poverty Reduction in Sri Lanka, formulated by the Government with participation of\nmajor stakeholders in the country including the aid agencies, has recently been completed. It will be\npresented at the forthcoming Development Forum of Sri Lanka in December 2000.", "                                                                                                     Appendix 5, page 2\n70\nto the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and source of\nlivelihood, and thousands of children have lost one or both parents. The conflict has also\nled to the increase of households headed by women, which are more likely experiencing\neconomic hardship. The next population census, planned to start in early 2001, will\ncover the Northern and Eastern provinces.\n5. Another  significant  finding  in  the  Framework  for  Poverty Reduction  is  that\neducation assists the poor to rise out of poverty. Education has a strong impact on\nearning, and poverty levels decline as the schooling attainment of household heads and\nprincipal earners rises. The impact of education on the increase of earnings ranges from\n14 percent for primary education to 320 percent for postgraduate for males, and 1\npercent for primary education to 348 percent for postgraduate for females. The poverty\nlevel  is  estimated  at  57  percent  for  nonschooled  illiterate;  45  percent  for  primary\nschoolers; 13 percent for O-level qualified; 6.5 percent for A-level qualified; and nil for\nundergraduates.\n6.  For a long time Government policy has identified the importance of poverty\nreduction and job creation. Past and present Government policies have been based on\nthe free provision of social services coupled with a widespread social safety net. The\nlatest  initiative  in  this  series  of  programs  is  the  Samurdhi  (prosperity)  program,\nintroduced in 1994, aimed at providing social services and a social safety net to very\npoor  households.  Conclusive  results  on  the  development  impact  of  efforts  such  as\nSamurdhi are not yet available, making it hard to render definitive judgments.\n7. Given the country's macroeconomic situation, the cost of the continuing civil\nconflict, and Sri Lanka\u2019s eroding public finance base, it is unlikely that sufficient public\nresources  would  be  available  specifically  to  directly  combat  poverty  and  generally\nprovide required social and economic services. Within this context, the Government\u2019s\nFramework  for  Poverty  Reduction  advocates  a  three-pronged  strategy  for  poverty\nreduction: (i) improving economic and social opportunities for the poor, and broad-basing\nthe  benefits  of  growth,  (ii)  providing  security  to  people  unable  to  participate  in\nmainstream economic activities, and (iii) empowering and mobilizing the poor through\nimproved governance. Likewise, poverty in the areas of civil conflict is being addressed\nas part of the relief, resettlement, and reconstruction program, largely with a limited\namount of external financial resources.\nB.  Poverty Impact Analysis\n8. A set of stable and consistent macroeconomic policies underpins private sector-\nled growth and development. It is aptly noted in the Government Framework for Poverty\nReduction  that  macroeconomic  policies  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction\nwould consist of (i) sound fiscal management, (ii) expansion of the monetary base\nconsistent with low inflation and stable prices, (iii) a competitive exchange rate, (iv) a\nforeign trade and tax regime that is nondiscriminatory across sectors and activities, (v)\nstructural policies to promote private sector development (e.g., continued divestiture of\nGovernment  commercial  enterprises  and  establishment  of  a  corporate  governance\nframework for state-owned enterprises), and (vi) labor market reforms to improve labor\nmarket mobility. Severe macroeconomic instability acts like a regressive tax on the poor.\nInstability erodes confidence, which then reduces the amount of investment. Lower\ninvestment reduces employment growth and leaves many poor households trapped in\nlow-productivity self-employment. High rates of inflation erode the value of the wages", "                                                                                                     Appendix 5, page 3\n71\nreceived and savings held by the poor. When fiscal deficits crowd the private sector out\nof the domestic financial markets, it is often the poor who bears the costs.\n9. The proposed Program will play a direct role in poverty reduction as it will help\ncreate an enabling environment for increased private sector activities by strengthening\nthe legal and regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure, enhance\nprivate access to financing, and strengthen competition policy and consumer protection.\nThrough increased private participation in infrastructure, the PSDP will support the rising\ncontribution of public investment to poverty reduction-oriented public investment efforts\nby freeing resources for the public sector to provide basic education, primary heath care,\nand direct social safety nets. The Government has committed to continuing its efforts to\nmaintain the level of annual social expenditures to protect public spending that primarily\nbenefits the poor. This is being complemented by MOFP institutional reforms aimed at\nintroducing  program  budgeting,  upgrading  the  quality  and  capacity  of  MOFP  staff,\ndeveloping a medium-term budget framework, automating public accounts and audit\npractices,  and  introducing  a  public  expenditure  information  system  to  track\nimplementation.2\n10. The role of the private sector in poverty reduction is also seen in the more\nefficient and effective delivery of basic services to the poor through improved productivity\nand  the  promotion  of  competition.  Increased  private  sector  activities  also  increase\nemployment and income generating opportunities for the poor. In view of the large\nprivatization program proposed under the PSDP, specific support is included to ease the\nsocial impacts that may accompany the privatization programs, thus to ensure that\ncompensation  packages  for  voluntary  retirements  and  job  placement  services\nadequately address the concerns of the affected workers.\n                                                \n2 ADB is assisting the Government in these areas under TA 3301-SRI: Strengthening Public Expenditure\nManagement Systems, for $3.0 million, approved on 16 November 1999.", "72\n                                                                                                     Appendix 5, page 4\nTable A12: Private Sector Development and Public Enterprise Reforms\nType of Effect\nChannel Short-term Long-term Macro Non-poor\nPublic Transfer Decrease in More Negative in the short-term Nonapplicable or no\nthe case of budgetary and positive in the long-term effect\ndivestment of funds are\nGovernment available,\nshares. particularly for\nIncrease in the social sectors\ncase of PE\nrestructuring\nGovernance Positive from Positive from Positive overall.

Objectives\n1. The Technical Assistance (TA) will support (i) consensus-building among stakeholders\nand affected parties on proposed reforms; (ii) institutionalization of good governance principles\nand practices among public and private enterprises; (iii) capacity building of regulatory and\nsupervisory  authorities  with  oversight  responsibilities  for  competition  policy  and  consumer\nprotection, insurance companies, private superannuation benefits funds, and capital markets;\nand (iv) handling of labor disputes and establishment of social safety net.\nB.  Scope and Summary Terms of Reference\n2. The TA has the following 5 components\n3. Stakeholders\u2019 Conferences. The IMF resident mission in Sri Lanka is organizing a\nseries of 6 to 8 conferences to discuss, build ownership, and internalize principles regarding\nrequired reforms in pursuance of the Government\u2019s vision for the 21st century. About 100\nparticipants  representing  a  cross-section  of  Sri  Lanka  active  in  the  areas  covered  by  the\nconferences will be invited. ADB has been invited to sponsor these conferences. This will be\nparticularly useful to the Private Sector Development Program (PSDP) in building consensus\nand enhancing support for the targeted reforms.\n4. Institutionalizing  Good  Corporate  Governance  among  Public  and  Private\nEnterprises and Capacity Building for Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) and\nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  This  component  aims  to  strengthen  the\ncorporate  governance  of  public  and  private  sector  enterprises.  The  TA  will  support  the\nformulation of a code of conduct that embodies the principles of good governance, review the\nstructure, scope and adequacy of powers of corporate governance units (CGUs) that will be\ncharged with the oversight function at the Public Finance Department of MOFP (PFD-MOFP)\nand SEC, and recommend appropriate strengthening measures, organize corporate governance\nworkshop(s), and provide on-the-job training for CGU staff at PFD-MOFP and SEC. The TA will\nalso support capacity building for SEC to undertake its new regulatory functions including\nsecurities underwriters, margin providers, credit-rating agencies, investment managers, and\nclearing houses, and for undertaking effective enforcement.\n5. Capacity Building for the Consumer Protection Authority. The TA will help develop\ncapacity of key officials and staff of the newly organized consumer protection authority (CPA) to\ndeal with anticompetition practices and violations of consumer protection laws. It will conduct\non-the-job training and hold workshops in Colombo for key operating staff. The Government is\nconcerned that due to inexperience, implementation will be weak, particularly coordination with\nother Government ministries and agencies, such as those dealing with privatization and build-\nown-operate (BOO)/build-operate-transfer (BOT) arrangements.\n6. Capacity Building for the Insurance and Private Superannuation Benefits Funds\nRegulatory Authority. The TA aims to implement the recommendations of the World Bank TA\nregarding the establishment of the regulatory authorities. The TA will help operationalize the\nregulatory  authorities;  prepare  a  (i)  strategic  and  operating  plan;  (ii)  manual  of  operations\ncovering the organizational structure and functions, systems, and procedures; (iii) management", "Appendix 6, page 2\n74\ninformation system for the start-up organization; and (iv) a road map for future expansion and\nbroadening  of  its  sphere  of  authority.  The  TA  will  recommend  prudential  regulations  for\ninsurance and superannuation benefits funds, recommend an appropriate investment policy that\nallows investments in private securities and, if deemed necessary, in foreign securities based on\na phased liberalization plan, defining risk limits and portfolio parameters given the absorptive\ncapacity of the Sri Lankan capital market  and the availability of acceptable investment grade\nsecurities and projects, recommend appropriate insurance products for development that extend\nsocial protection and cover risks required to promote investments in infrastructure and related\nareas.\n7. With regard to the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF),\nthe TA will assist the Government consider an appropriate structure to improve the operations of\nthe  EPF  and  ETF  in  terms  of  administrative  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  investment\noperations; if privatizing the funds management operations of EPF and ETF is warranted at this\nstage, determine appropriate accreditation guidelines for private fund managers and the terms\nof funds management. A suitable training program would also be set up for the regulatory body\nin terms of required skills against available inventory of skills. Capacity building will be carried\nout in key areas of operation to ensure that the regulatory authority function immediately. In\norder to enhance social safety net provision in Sri Lanka, the TA will also support a study to\nrationalize workers' welfare benefits, including possible insurance for displaced workers, and\ndefine approaches for incorporating benefits into a formal social security system.\n8. Dispute  resolution  and  establishment  of  social  safety  net.  The  purpose  of  the\ntechnical assistance is to support capacity building for mediators, conciliators and arbitrators in\nsettling  labor  disputes.  The  TA  will  also  assist  the  Government  design  and  structure  and\noperationalize  the  proposed  social  safety  net  for  workers  to  provide  job  counseling,  job\nplacement and retraining services for displaced workers.\n9. The detailed terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix E.\nC.  Cost Estimate and Financing\n10. The  combined  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $3,650,000  equivalent,  comprising\n$2,155,000 in foreign exchange and $1,495,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide\n$1,900,000 to cover the foreign exchange cost of $1,425,000 and part of the local currency cost\nequivalent to $475,000. The TA will be financed on grant basis by ADB from the Japan Special\nFund funded by the Government of Japan. SIDA will provide a total grant of $1,000,000, on\nparallel basis, that will cover $730,000 of foreign currency cost and $270,000 of local currency\ncost. The balance in local currency cost will be provided by the Government. The detailed cost\nestimates and financing arrangements are provided in Table A13.\nD.  Implementations Arrangements\n11.
