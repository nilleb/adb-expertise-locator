The CPA component comprises \ninstallation  of  a  computerized  container  terminal  management \nsystem (CTMS), measures to improve port area water quality, and \nimprovements  to  the  intra-port  roads  and  bridges.  The  CHC \ncomponent comprises activation of ASYCUDA++ (an automated \nsystem for customs data management) with connections to the \nCTMS, and installation of container scanners needed to meet new \nsecurity  initiatives.  The  RHD  component  is  construction  of  an \naccess-controlled  link  (connector  road)  from  Chittagong  port \naccess  road  to  the  two  container  terminals  at  the  port  of \nChittagong. \n   \nRationale  Unless  immediate  measures  are  taken  to  lower  the  country\u2019s \nshipping and port costs, which are twice as high as those in some \nneighboring  country  ports,  the  trade  competitiveness  of \nBangladesh will rapidly diminish. A fundamental source of high \ncosts at the port of Chittagong is container yard congestion, due \npartly  to  paper-based  terminal  management  and  document \nprocessing,  and  limited  road  access.  Additionally,  the  customs \nclearance  process  requires  documents  to  be  manually  moved \nthrough  several  stages  requiring  48  endorsements,  thereby \nlowering port capacity and encouraging corruption.  \n \nAccidental  spillages  of  oil  and  wastewater  containing  oil  from \nships  occur  frequently  in  the  port  area.  Management  of  such \nincidents  according  to  the  International  Convention  for  the \nPrevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) requires an \nimmediate investment in spill cleanup equipment and an oil-waste \ntreatment facility. Likewise, the port needs to meet national and \n   ", "iv   \ninternational security standards, which require the installation of \ncontainer scanners. \n \nObjective   The Project will increase the capacity of the container terminal at \n  the port of Chittagong and enable international port security and \nenvironmental  standards  to  be  met.  In  the  medium  term,  the \nProject will lead to lower shipping and port charges, which will \nfoster more international trade. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $41.3 million \nequivalent.  This  figure  includes  value-added  tax,  cost  of \nconsulting services, physical and price contingencies on all base \ncosts, capitalized interest, and commitment fees charged by Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) during implementation.  \n \nFinancing Plan   \n  Foreign  Local \nSource/  Total  Percent of \nExchange  Currency \nComponent  Cost  Project Cost \n($ million)  ($ million) \n  ADB   30.6  0.0  30.6  74.1 \n  Government         \n  CPA Component    0.0  2.7  2.7    6.5 \n  CHC Component    0.0  0.6  0.6    1.5 \n  RHD Component    0.0  7.4  7.4  17.9 \n         \n \nTotal  30.6       10.7     41.3        100.0 \n  ADB - Asian Development Bank; CHC - Customs House of Chittagong; CPA - \n  Chittagong Port Authority; RHD \u2013 Roads and Highways Department \n  Note:  CHC  and  RHD  components  will  be  financed  through  government \n  budgetary allocations. CPA component will be financed out of its own funds. \n  Source: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  A loan of 30,600,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nTerms  be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. Accordingly, \nADB will finance all foreign exchange costs, amounting to 74.1% \nof the total project cost. The Government will finance all local \ncurrency costs, which amount to 25.9% of the total project cost. \nADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Government to \nRHD and CHC through budgetary allocations. Amounts allocated \nto CPA will be subject to repayment to the Government under a \nsubsidiary loan agreement with terms and conditions acceptable \nto ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 July 2005 to 1 January 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  1 July 2008 \nCompletion Date \n ", "  v\n   \nExecuting Agency  CPA, CHC, and RHD will serve as the executing agencies (EAs) \n  for the respective components of the Project.  \n   \nImplementation  Each EA will establish a project implementation unit to administer \nArrangements  the  component  under  its  jurisdiction.  A  project  coordination \n  committee  chaired  by  the  chairperson,  CPA,  comprising \ncommissioner,  CHC  and  additional  chief  engineer,  RHD,  will \nserve as a channel of communication among the three EAs. The \ncommittee will meet every 3 months, or more often if necessary, \nto review progress and resolve outstanding issues pertaining to \nthe Project. \n   Procurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nContracts valued in excess of $500,000 for goods and $2.0 million \nfor civil works will be procured through international competitive \nbidding (ICB). Procurement of civil works in the RHD component, \nand  the  supply  of  goods  for  computerization,  environmental \nprotection, and security will follow ICB procedures to encourage \nparticipation  of  international  competitors  and  joint  ventures \nthrough domestic contractors.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Five separate international consultancy firms financed by the loan \n  will be recruited by the respective EAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based selection mechanism: \n \nCPA will recruit two firms to: \n(i)  design and supervise the construction of the internal road \nsystem and the environmental management facilities; and  \n(ii)  supervise  the  procurement  and  implementation  of  the \nCTMS and the management information system.  \n \nCHC will recruit: \n(i)  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on \na  direct  basis  to  activate  the  manifest  module  in \nASYCUDA++ and other on-the-job training to CHC staff as \na sole supplier; and \n(ii)  a firm to supervise the procurement of scanners and on-\nthe-job training on use and maintenance.  \n \nRHD will recruit a firm to design and supervise the construction of \nthe connector road.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The primary economic benefits would be the lower overall costs \nBeneficiaries  due  to  shorter  ship  turnaround  and  container  dwell  times.  The \n  economic internal rate of return is estimated to be about 21.6% and \nthe net present value is $61.5 million at a discount rate of 12.0%.\nThe Project will also help increase Chittagong\u2019s potential to be a \ngateway port for international trade of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.  \n   ", "vi   \n \nRisks and  Insufficient capacity of EAs to attract and retain staff skilled in \nAssumptions  automated processes is the most likely, but a minimal, technical \n  risk. Technical assistance will be provided to train existing staff \nand to formulate a human resource development plan to minimize \nthat potential risk.  \n \nIt is assumed that the growth in traffic, fueled largely by increased \ntrade  and  lower  non-trade  barriers,  will  continue  as  projected. \nMarginal sensitivity of the economic internal rate of return to lower \nthan  projected  traffic  demonstrates  that  economic  risks  are \nminimal. \n \nIt is also assumed that the Government will support the respective \nagencies in implementing the key aspects of the port efficiency \nimprovement  plan,  such  as  relocating  customs  auctioning  and \ncontainer  stuffing  activities  to  off-quay  sites,  needed  to  derive \nlong-term cost reductions.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB will finance an advisory TA of $700,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund.  The  TA  will  have  two \ncomponents. A sum of $240,000 will be made available to the first \ncomponent  to  address  hinterland  transportation  issues  at  the \nmacro  level.  The  second  component  ($460,000)  is  targeted \nspecifically  at  the  port  of  Chittagong  to  help  sustain  project \nbenefits in the long term. Both components will be financed from \nthe Japan Special Fund. \n \nThe first component will: (i) assess the performance of the three \nmodes (road, rail, and inland waterways) in the Dhaka-Chittagong \ncorridor,  and  (ii) recommend  institutional,  operational,  and \ninfrastructure  improvements  to  increase  the  efficiency  and \ncompetitiveness of the modes. The Ministry of Communications \nwill be the EA for this component.  \n \nThe second component will assist in the implementation of the \nport efficiency improvement plan. In particular, it will assist: (i) the \nMinistry of Shipping and CPA revise port tariffs, (ii) CPA prepare a \nstrategic plan, and (iii) CHC and CPA comply with the agreed \nmilestones for the planned actions. CPA will be the EA for this \ncomponent.  A  working  committee  cochaired  by  the  chief  of \nplanning  of  CPA  and  involving  CHC  management  will  be \nestablished to monitor the work. \n ", "       vii \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Bangladesh for the Chittagong Port Trade Facilitation Project (the Project). The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for implementing a port efficiency improvement \nplan and developing operational strategies for improving the efficiency of transport and logistics \nin the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The project framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Introduction \n \n2.  Driven by strong demand in its main trading partners, Bangladesh\u2019s economy expanded \nat an average annual rate of over 5% in the last 5 years.1 International trade during that period \ngrew at 10% per annum. By 2003, almost 45% of all exports was destined to European Union \nand over 25% to the United States (US), while nearly 30% of all imports originated in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India. Almost 85% of exports and 25% of imports were textiles \nor textile materials.  \n \n3.  More than a third of the nation\u2019s economic activity is presently located within the Dhaka-\nChittagong corridor, where the bulk of international trade is generated. The corridor is served by \nthree modes of transportation: road, rail, and inland waterways, which together carry about      \n20 million tonnes of freight annually. There are three main ports in Bangladesh: Chittagong,2 \nMongla,3 and Dhaka-Narayanganj (see map). However, 80% of the trade flows through the port \nof Chittagong, which is also an integral part of the subregional transport and logistics chain \nconnecting northeastern India, Bhutan, and Nepal to Europe, North America, and Southeast \nAsia. Therefore, the efficiency of the transportation system in the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor, \nand the port of Chittagong in particular, is vital for sustaining economic growth.  \n \n2.  Operational Performance \n \n4.  The port of Chittagong is owned and operated by Chittagong Port Authority (CPA). The \nGovernment, through provisions in the CPA Ordinance, oversees planning, expenditure, and \nhuman resource management. CPA\u2019s operating revenues in the last 6 years have grown at an \naverage annual rate of about 10%, and foreign exchange earnings reached $42.3 million in \n2003, constituting nearly 49% of total revenues. Customs operations at the port are also an \nimportant source of revenue, which accounted for nearly 28% of total public revenue in 2002.  \n                                                 \n1  Export receipts in the first quarter of 2004 grew by 16.2% year on year while imports grew by 20%. Real gross \ndomestic product growth is expected to reach 5.7% in FY2003/04 and 6.0% in FY2004/05 (Economist Intelligence \nUnit/ADB Asian Development Outlook 2004).  \n2  The port facilities comprise 13 general cargo berths of which four are used for containers, and the Chittagong \ncontainer terminal (CCT), which comprises two berths with a total length of 450 meters (m) and a backup yard \narea of approximately 20 hectares (ha) (49 acres). There are 5,355 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) yard ground \nslots in the area. \n3  The number of ships calling at Mongla fell from 355 in 1998 to 106 in 2003, and revenue decreased by more than \n80% between 2002 and 2003 due to the changes in trading patterns and increasing draft restrictions. ", "2  \n5.  Containers handled at Chittagong in the last 10 years increased at an average annual \nrate  of  approximately  15%.  In  2003,  it  handled  over  600,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units \n(TEUs),  and  bulk  cargo  throughput  reached  approximately  21 million  tonnes  (Appendix 2). \nTraffic is expected to reach 43 million tonnes (with a container throughput of 1,678,000 TEUs) \nby 2016.4 Direct employment by CPA totals approximately 8,500 persons. The port creates \nadditional employment for 6,200 dockworkers, 5,300 merchant laborers, and 3,000 stevedores. \nThe total annual wages and salaries of the above groups amounted to about 27% of CPA\u2019s total \nrevenue in fiscal year 2002/03.5 The Government has plans to gradually reduce the labor force \nthrough an early retirement program, which began in May 2004, and outsource more activities \nto  privately  owned  off-dock  facilities.  Those  plans  would  allow  the  introduction  of  more \nmechanized cargo handling. \n \n6.  Despite  the  increase  in  throughput  and  overall  performance  in  the  past  8  years, \nproductivity remains fairly low, and the port has become a serious tangle in the supply chain. In \nAugust 2004, asset utilization averaged only 184 TEUs per berth per day and port stay about \n2.9 days.6 Average container dwell time at the port has remained almost unchanged over the \npast few years at about 18 days compared with about 10 to 12 days at comparable container \nterminals in the region. Average transit time by rail between the port and the inland container \ndepot (ICD) in Dhaka,7 including port-handling time, is about 30 hours and costs about $250 per \nTEU. However, import containers have to remain at the port for about 2 days on average from \nthe time of arrival before being assigned a slot on a train. In comparison, it costs about $400 per \nTEU to transport by truck, but takes about 12 hours for door-to-door delivery, and mostly in \nbreak-bulk form. Media reports claim that informal payments to expedite the flow of documents \nthrough CPA and Customs House of Chittagong (CHC) are on the rise. These delays and \npayments contribute to the higher maritime cost of Bangladesh\u2019s textile exports to the US, \ncompared with exports from the People\u2019s Republic of China; India; Taipei, China; and Thailand. \n \n7.   At least one spill of oil or wastewater containing oil occurs in the port area every week. \nConsequently,  water  quality  in  river  Karnaphuli  under  the  jurisdiction  of  CPA  is  low.  The \nconcentration of oil in the water samples taken in the port area was found during the feasibility \nstudy  to  be  between  30  and  338  parts  per million  (ppm).  TA  3357-BAN,8 through  training \nworkshops and discussions with the Government, produced contingency plans and monitoring \nand training manuals for environmental management. However, the main recommendations of \nthe TA, including procurement of equipment and materials, and training of oil-spill contingency \nteam staff, have not been carried out. \n \n8.  CPA has met the basic requirements specified under the International Shipping and Port \nSecurity code. However, it is yet to meet all the requirements specified under the container \nsecurity initiative launched by US customs in January 2002. This initiative requires measures in \nplace at the originating port to detect potential security breaches such as human and drug \n                                                 \n4  \"Ports System Development Project: Master Plan and Trade Facilitation Study\". 1998.

The measures include container scanners and automated tools for monitoring export \ncontainers and processing import containers by CHC.  \n   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Constraints \n \n9.  Container dwell times at the port of Chittagong, which have remained high but stable in the \npast 5 years are beginning to rise sharply due to manual operations management and document \nprocessing methods. Under the manual methods now in place, documents pass through many \nstages,  requiring  48  endorsements,  which,  in  addition  to  increasing  dwell  times,  create \nopportunities for corruption. Likewise, the present manual container tracking system unduly delays \ncontainer  movements  in  the  yard.  Without  the  use  of  information  technology  (IT),  berth \nproductivity will further decline and add to shipping costs.  \n \n10.  Even with a computerized port management system, certain customs processing rules \nnow in force will continue to limit port capacity. One example is CHC\u2019s rule related to off-port \ncontainer freight stations (CFSs) and ICDs, which prevents newly constructed private CFSs \nfrom handling import containers. ICD Dhaka, the only facility permitted to handle both import \nand export containers, is poorly connected to the port both by road and rail. Consequently, only \nabout 10% of the import containers are processed there, even though 70% of the import and \nexport cargo either originates from or terminates in Dhaka. With the exception of another \napproximately 10% that are handled at nearby facilities, the remaining less than container load \n(LCL) and full container load (FCL) containers are unstuffed in the yards, thereby requiring \nadditional vehicles to enter the port. Delays on the part of consignees taking delivery of import \ncargoes  and  CHC\u2019s  inefficient  auctioning  rules  on  unclaimed  consignments  also  add  to \ncontainer dwell times. Since the port is already operating at capacity, such rules compound the \nbarriers to trade.  \n \n11.  The  Government\u2019s  ratification  of  the  International  Convention  for  the  Prevention  of \nPollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) in September 2003 can also be expected to limit port \ncapacity unless oil-waste reception and treatment facilities, and other basic infrastructure and \nequipment  necessary  for  managing  maritime  waste  are  provided.  Moreover,  no  routine \nmonitoring of concentration of pollutants, including oil and grease, is conducted in the port area. \nUnder MARPOL 73/78, all ports are required to have adequate reception and treatment facilities \nfor oil waste and noxious liquid substances as well as a clear management plan for handling \nother wastes in close coordination with the local government. It also sets out standards for the \nmajor categories of pollution from ship and port operations such as: (i) oil, (ii) noxious liquid \nsubstances, (iii) harmful substances, (iv) sewage, and (v) solid waste. Failure to comply with \nthese requirements could result in possible embargoes.  \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n \n12.  According  to  a  post  evaluation  conducted  by  ADB  9  the  overall  effectiveness  and \nsuccess of ADB-funded projects in ports and shipping is reportedly high.  In the first Chittagong \nPort Project in Bangladesh, the recalculated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was higher \nthan at appraisal. The post evaluation report notes that lack of management reporting systems \nfor assessing port operating efficiency is one factor adversely affecting operating performance, \nwhich this Project aims to remedy.  In the case of advisory TAs, the post evaluation revealed \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1996.

Manila. \n   ", "4  \nthat  institutional  strengthening  of  financial  and  management  reporting  systems  and  data \nprocessing  helped  achieve  some  success,  although  lack  of  staff  qualified  for  training \nconstrained TA implementation. The advisory TA to CPA under this Project is structured to \nensure  that  a  firm  with  specific  experience  and  broad  understanding  of  related  issues  is \nrecruited to provide consultancy services to compensate for the institutional weaknesses and to \nmaximize knowledge transfer. The Government has provided specific assurances to assign \nsuitably qualified staff to be trained in the operation and management of the new computer \nsystems.  The  implementation  delays  of  past  road  projects  managed  by  the  Roads  and \nHighways  Department  (RHD)  have  been  caused  largely  by  lengthy  government  approval \nprocesses. Such delays will be lessened in future since the Government has introduced shorter \ntime limits for approval and revised public procurement rules. Moreover, RHD is planning to \naward more design-build contracts, which would speed up implementation by eliminating the \ndelays in recruiting separate design consultants. \n \n3.  Outlook \n \n13.  The Government has initiated several capital projects at the port of Chittagong under the \nsixth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007). CPA has procured 13 straddle carriers, 12 reach stackers, \n22 trailers, six rubber-tired gantries, and other minor container-handling equipment in the last 5 \nyears. Four gantry cranes will be installed at the Chittagong container terminal (CCT) by the end \nof  2005.  A  1,000-meter  container  quay  with  a  capacity  of  500,000  TEUs  (New  Mooring \ncontainer terminal or NMCT), which will be managed by a private entity under a concession \nagreement, is currently under construction. NMCT will be equipped with six to eight gantry \ncranes, and have a 220,000-square meter back-up area. These will help speed up container \nhandling and lower ship turnaround times, which in turn would lead to lower freight rates. \n \n14.  Procedural and operational solutions have been introduced to improve capacity and \nthereby enhance the competitiveness of the exports and lower the price of imports. Under a \nproject  financed  by  the  World  Bank 10 ,  a  computerized  customs  management  system \n(ASYCUDA++)  developed  by  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development \n(UNCTAD) has been introduced at four inland ports,11 port of Chittagong, and the National \nBoard of Revenue\u2019s headquarters. CHC has shifted all its import groups into the customs hall \nroom and under ASYCUDA++ operations. ASYCUDA++ modules cover most foreign trade \nprocedures, and can handle manifests and customs declarations, accounting procedures, and \ntransit and suspense procedures. Although all modules are not activated, the system permits \nabout 50% of importers to clear cargo within 24 hours. Since 1 June 2004, extra penal rent is \ncharged on containers not cleared within 45 days, which forces importers to expedite clearance. \nAdditionally, a new ICD is being initiated at Narayanganj. These measures in concert will partly \nease container yard congestion in the short term. \n \n15.  The Government has clearly expressed interest in seeking an immediate solution to the \npresent  capacity  problem  through  a  transition  from  the  existing  manual,  paper-based \noperational  system  to  a  transparent,  expeditious  IT  system.  In  addition  to  speeding  up \noperations, the IT system would also minimize opportunities for corruption, which takes place in \nthe form of informal payments for expediting document processing or altering cargo manifests. \nMoreover, given the volume of time-sensitive exports to the US and increasing containerized \nimports, the Government is committed to meeting security requirements critical for maintaining \n                                                 \n10  Customs Administration Modernization (CAM-1) Project. \n11  ICD Kamalupur, Dhaka, Benapole, and Mongla. \n ", "  5\ndelivery  schedules.  Better  access  to  the  port  area,  enhanced  internal  circulation,  and \nguaranteed ship operations with minimal environmental impacts are also port sector priorities.   \n \n4.  Linkages to Asian Development Bank Strategy \n \n16.  ADB has adopted a programmatic approach to assist transport sector development in \nBangladesh.  Accordingly,  interventions  are  planned  in  different  subsectors  of  transport  to \nimprove operational efficiency and integrate the different modes. This Project is part of those \ninterventions and is included in the Bangladesh Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u2013\n2006). It is also the first ADB investment project in the port sector in over two decades (a \ncomplete list of external assistance to the port subsector in Bangladesh is given in Appendix 3). \nGiven that the port is an integral part of the subregional transport system linking four nations\u2014of \nwhich various elements in Bhutan,12 India (West Bengal),13 Nepal,14 and Bangladesh15 were \ndeveloped with ADB assistance\u2014the Project, by increasing the port\u2019s capacity, will serve as a \ncatalyst for attracting a larger share of transit traffic to and from  neighboring countries to \nChittagong.  Moreover,  the  proposed  ADB  loan  for  railway  sector  development16 will  help \nincrease the capacity and speed of Dhaka-Chittagong rail services, while the access-controlled \nChittagong port access road, which is already under construction with ADB financing17, will \nprovide a direct link from the Dhaka-Chittagong highway to the port. The expected increase in \nland transport capacity in the corridor due to the rail and road projects will substantially enhance \nport capacity18 and contribute to long-term sustainability of the proposed Project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n17.  The objective of this Project is to increase the capacity of the container terminal at the \nport  of  Chittagong,  and  enable  Bangladesh  to  meet  international  port  security  and \nenvironmental standards. The resultant reductions in overall shipping and port-handling charges \nwill facilitate international trade and foster economic growth in the long term.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n18.  The  Project  will  comprise  three  main  components  with  several  interrelated \nsubcomponents. \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2000.

Special Features \n \n  1.  Port Efficiency Improvement Plan \n \n19.  In  addition  to  introducing  IT,  several  procedural  and  operational  improvements  are \nneeded to realize the full potential of the planned and ongoing investment in infrastructure and \ncargo-handling  equipment  at  the  port.  They  include  enhancement  of  personnel  skills, \nintroduction of a strategic plan for cutting costs and increasing port productivity, support for the \npreparation  of  an  anticorruption  strategy,  modernization  of  specific  customs  procedures, \nrevisions to port tariffs, and environmental management in the port as summarized in the port \nefficiency improvement plan (PEIP) in Appendix 4. The relevant agencies have already initiated \ndiscussions on possible improvements. Among the aspects considered are: (i) a new customs \nwarehouse  and  other  facilities  along  the  Bangladesh  Railway  corridor  adjacent  to  the \nChittagong port access road, (ii) a FCL yard in the port park, (iii) an intermodal terminal in close \nproximity to the port park, and (iv) a new CFS facility. To facilitate timely implementation of the \nPEIP, support will be provided under the TA component of the Project.  \n   \n2.  Environmental Management  \n \n20.  The  Project  will  support  the  construction  and  operationalization  of  an  oil-waste \nseparation plant, a laboratory for routine monitoring, and implementation of a comprehensive \nenvironmental management plan to meet MARPOL 73/78 requirements. It is expected that \nships  without  onboard  oil-waste  treatment  equipment  calling  at  the  port19 will  utilize  the \nproposed facilities to dispose of oil waste, and enable CPA to meet Bangladesh\u2019s effluent \nstandards for oil-related activities.  \n \n21.  The Project has been classified as Environmental Category B. An initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003)  and  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected Infrastructure Development Projects (1993). The summary IEE (Appendix 5) indicates \nthat there will be no major adverse environmental impacts during and after implementation. \nTherefore, no further impact assessment studies are needed. \n \n22.  To address the minor, localized, and temporary impacts, a mitigation and monitoring \nplan as detailed in the summary IEE has been designed. The plan requires measures in place, \nparticularly, to prevent any soil erosion and vegetation damage and prevent possible spread of, \nand exposure to, potentially hazardous and radioactive materials and waste in the project area.  \n                                                 \n19  About 1,700 ocean-going vessels and 4,000 coastal ships called at the port of Chittagong in 2003. \n   ", "8  \n  3.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n23.  The land acquisition and other resettlement impacts of the Project will not be significant. \nHowever, they will affect about 112 people in 19 households, 6 businesses, and 3 community \nbuildings, which are located on 9.5 hectares of land belonging to CPA. The affected persons \n(APs) are mainly informal dwellers who do not have land titles to the property that they currently \noccupy. The removal of APs will trigger resettlement safeguards. All APs are entitled to receive \ncompensation packages, elaborated in the entitlement matrix of the short resettlement plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix A).  During  socioeconomic  surveys  and  consultations,  all  APs \nexpressed their willingness to relocate themselves. Assistance with relocation will be provided \nto them as outlined in Supplementary Appendix A. The plan was translated into Bangla and was \ndisclosed to all APs. It will also be posted on RHD and ADB web sites. The Project will not have \nany impacts on indigenous peoples. Indigenous populations are concentrated in the Hill Districts \nof Chittagong and are not engaged in employment activities associated with the port.   \n \n  4.  Collaboration with US Trade and Development Agency  \n \n24.  The US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide grant funds for a detailed \nassessment of needs, including preparation of technical specifications, and training on law \nenforcement  and  procurement  of  container  scanners.  The  grant  will  also  enable  recently \ninitiated technology-based security management measures of CPA and CHC to be integrated \nwith the scanner system to maximize the utility of the CHC component financed by the Project. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n25.  As shown in Table 1 and Appendix 6, the total cost of the Project is estimated at \n$41.3 million equivalent. This figure includes value-added tax, cost of consulting services, and \nphysical and price contingencies on all base costs, capitalized interest, and commitment fees \ncharged by ADB during implementation.  \n \n ", "  9\nTable 1.

The committee will \nconsist of representatives of MOC, National Board of Revenue, Economic Relations Division \nand  Finance  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Planning  Commission,  Implementation \nMonitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning, and representatives of the three \nEAs. The steering committee will meet at least every six months or more frequently if necessary. \n   \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n30.  The Project will be implemented over a period of about 48 months from 2005 to 2008, \nincluding  procurement  and  pre-  and  postconstruction  activities.  The  scheduled  date  of \ncompletion of civil works and equipment installation is July 2008. The proposed timings for the \nvarious components are shown in Appendix 7. \n     \n  3.  Procurement  \n \n31.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts valued  in  excess  of  $500,000  equivalent  for \ngoods  and  $2.0 million  equivalent  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). Procurement of civil works on the connector road, and the supply of \ngoods for computerization, environmental protection, and container scanning equipment will \nfollow ICB procedures to encourage participation of international competitors and joint ventures \nthrough domestic contractors. Civil works contracts valued less than $2.0 million equivalent will \nbe procured based on local competitive bidding procedures. Indicative contract packages are \nlisted in Appendix 8. \n \n32.  In view of the significance and relationship of the Project to ongoing road and port \ndevelopment activities, ADB approved advance procurement action. The advance action, up to \nbut  not  including  the  signing  of  the  contracts,  will  cover  (i) selection  of  consultants, \n(ii) prequalification of civil works contractors, and (ii) tendering and evaluation of bids for civil \nworks and supply of goods. Advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n   \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n33.

Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n40.   Each EA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures \nincurred on the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles. In addition to the audit conducted by the Comptroller and \nAuditor  General,  consolidated  project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  private  sector \nauditors acceptable to ADB. CPA will submit its audited financial statements and audited project \naccounts to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. CHC and RHD will \nsubmit their audited project accounts to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear.  \n \n41.  The EAs will prepare and submit to ADB monthly, quarterly, and annual progress reports \non project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. The EAs will \nmonitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  implementation \nschedule, and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the schedule. To \nfacilitate postevaluation of the Project, each EA will submit a project completion report to ADB \nwithin 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n42.  A set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Project in \nrelation to its goals, purposes, and outputs was agreed upon with the EAs. Shortly before \nimplementation, baseline values will be established for: (i) traffic volumes and vessel turnaround \ntimes;  (ii) port  tariffs  and  transport  charges;  (iii) environmental  indicators;21and  (iv) social, \npoverty, and economic indicators. Monitoring indicators will be computed, with the necessary \nfrequency, during project implementation, and 2, 4, and 6 years after completion. Comments \nand findings regarding these project indicators will be incorporated in every alternate quarterly \nreport to ADB. The project performance management system, which will be reviewed and \nrevised during the inception mission, is given in Appendix 9. \n \n43.  Where relevant, social indicators will be disaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys \nwill be conducted and results compared with the baseline. A final report will consist of an \nevaluation of changes that occurred in the 6 preceding years. The construction supervision \nconsultants will assist the EAs carry out the baseline surveys, establish parameters and a \n                                                 \n21  For this Project, oil and grease content in Karnaphuli river will be used as an indicator to monitor environmental \nconditions. \n ", "  13\nsystem  for  data  collection  and  analysis,  and  prepare  quarterly  performance  reports  during \nimplementation and, subsequently, project completion reports.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n44.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  regular  reviews  of  project  implementation \nincluding a detailed midterm review in January 2007. The midterm review will focus on project \nimpacts, particularly those relating to institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, and \nenvironmental aspects, including the resettlement plan. The Project\u2019s economic viability and \nother relevant aspects that may have an impact on performance will also be assessed during \nthe review. The review will also cover the implementation of the advisory TA, and compliance \nwith assurances in the Loan Agreement.    \n \n9.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n45.  The EAs and the Government will create and sustain a corruption-free environment in \naccordance with the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, and will follow the policy \nwhen  preparing  all  documents  and  contracts  during  the  bidding  process  and  during \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  emerging  national  and  local  initiatives  are \nexpected to eliminate opportunities for corruption related to port operations. The Anti-Corruption \nCommission  Bill  2004  has  led  to  the  formation  of  an  independent  commission  that  will \ninvestigate corruption charges and arrange trials by special judges. TA 4140-BAN22 is expected \nto  support  the  operationalization  and  capacity  building  of  that  commission.  Moreover,  the \nNational Board of Revenue and the finance ministry have prepared draft regulations and the \ncode of conduct for the tax ombudsperson at the port. The ombudsperson will act upon receipt \nof a written allegation of corruption against any tax or customs official. He or she will have the \nauthority to initiate an investigation against any tax or customs official and enter the residence \nor the business establishment of a suspected tax evader. As part of the Project, a port service \nimprovement committee (PSIC) will be established during implementation. With assistance from \nconsultants recruited under the advisory TA, the PSIC will prepare an anticorruption strategy \nthat will include publication of a schedule of port charges and maximum allowable times for the \ncore processes related to shipping and clearing cargo and other port-related activities, such as \npilotage and vessel berthing, as well as procedures for addressing complaints of unscheduled \nor excessive charges.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n46.  The advisory TA attached to the loan will have two components. A sum of $240,000 will \nbe made available for the first component to address hinterland transportation and logistics \nissues at the macro level. The second component ($460,000) is targeted specifically at the port \nof Chittagong to ensure the sustainability of project benefits.  \n \n47.  The first component is intended to identify and design mechanisms to promote the \ndevelopment of modern logistic chains within the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor involving transport, \ninformation  flows,  and  logistics  terminals.  It  will  develop  a  framework  for  developing  a \ncompetitive  transport  system  where  the  three  modes\u2014road,  railway,  and  inland  waterway \ntransport\u2014are  integrated  and  complement  each  other  to  offer  a  broader  range  of  service \noptions to shippers. To that end, a team of consultants recruited by ADB will (i) assess the \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting Good Governance \nInitiatives. Manila (Approved on 4 July 2003 for $1.0 million). \n   ", "14  \nperformance  of  the  three  modes  in  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor,  and  (ii) recommend \ninstitutional,  operational,  and  infrastructure  improvements  to  increase  efficiency  and \ncompetitiveness of the modes. The Ministry of Communications will be the Executing Agency. \nOutline TOR for the consultancy services are given in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n48.  The  second  component  is  designed  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  the  PEIP \n(Appendix 4).  A  team  of  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  to  (i) assist  CPA  and  CHC \nimplement the actions according to the milestones in the PEIP, (ii) support the implementation \nof a human resource development plan to broaden employee skills, (iii) assist the Ministry of \nShipping  and  CPA  implement  the  restructured  port  tariffs,  (iv) assist  CPA  develop  and \nimplement a strategic plan, and (v) help CPA establish and initialize the PSIC. CPA will be the \nEA  for  this  component.  A  committee,  chaired  by  the  chief  of  planning  of  CPA  with  a \nrepresentative of the Commissioner of CHC as a member, will be established to monitor and \nguide the work of the consultants. Outline TOR for the consultants are given in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n49.  ADB will finance $700,000 equivalent of the TA cost on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund. Two separate teams of domestic and international consultants, to be recruited by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  the  recruitment  of  domestic  consultants,  will  carry  out  the  two \ncomponents.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n50.  Total benefits derived from the Project principally comprise time-savings on the portside \n(container  shipowners)  and  quayside  (containerized  cargo  owners)  due  to  increased  port \ncapacity. Indeed, those benefits will not be realized unless the complementary measures such \nas the access road, internal circulation system, and scanners are implemented. Moreover, the \ntypes of vessels and shipping lines willing or able to enter the port, unless the international \nmarine  pollution  standards  are  not  met,  will  limit  port  capacity.  Therefore,  analyses  were \nperformed under different scenarios of traffic growth and capacity gains. Additional analyses \nwere  performed  to  examine  the  levels  of  economic  risk  under  the  different  scenarios  as \ndescribed in Appendix 10. \n \n51.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is estimated to be 21.6% and \nthe net present value is $61.5 million (Tk3.6 billion) at a discount rate of 12.0%. To test the \nrobustness of the Project, the sensitivity of EIRR to changes in three key variables was tested. It \nshowed that the forecast generated traffic must be less than half the most likely forecast for the \nEIRR to drop below 12%, but in the case of total annual costs and normal traffic, an increase of \nmore than 12% or a drop of more than 11% of the respective most likely estimate is needed for \nthe investment to be nonviable. A risk analysis based on the assumption that the distributions of \nthe above variables are known showed that the 5th percentile of the EIRR is 16.5% and the risk \nof EIRR falling below 12% is zero.  \n \nB.  Social Benefits \n \n52.  The national poverty rate in Bangladesh is 49.8 % (the estimate is based on the upper \npoverty  line  method  used  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  Household  Income  and \nExpenditure Survey, 2000), and 53.1% and 36.6%, respectively, in rural and urban areas. \n ", "  15\nAlthough agriculture is the largest sector, employing about 51% of the country\u2019s total labor force, \nit is still primitive in nature. The Project will contribute to economic growth required to reduce \npoverty through expansion of foreign trade leading to greater utilization of national transport \ncorridors. The principal project benefits will accrue to the shipowners in terms of reduced port \nturnover  times,  and  cargo  owners  will  benefit  from  reduced  container  dwell  times  through \ncomputerization of the terminal management and the resultant expansion of capacity. That will \ncreate new employment opportunities in the port as well as related sectors. Furthermore, the \nProject will also bring benefits to the surrounding communities, through increased port-related \nactivities. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is provided in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Financial Benefits \n \n53.  Financial projections have been prepared for CPA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB to \nassess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  CPA  component  (Appendix 10).  The \nprojected  financial  statement  indicates  that  financial  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  cover \noperation and maintenance costs (including incremental recurrent costs associated with the \nProject), income taxes, and debt servicing, and provide a reasonable rate of return. Based on \nthe financial projections, a debt service coverage ratio of 113.1 and an operating ratio of not \nless than 53% will be achieved over the project life.  \n \n54.  The financial evaluation of the CPA component was undertaken in real terms using \nconstant 2004 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were \nconverted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation \nand  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  by  evaluating  the \nfinancial  position  of  CPA  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  FIRR  for  the \ncomponent, computed on an after-tax basis, is 18%. This compares with the weighted average \ncost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 4%. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate \nthan the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. Based on financial projections and the \nfinancial evaluation of the CPA component, the Project is considered both financially viable and \nsustainable.  \n \nD.  Risks \n \n55.  The proposed Project has been formulated to minimize most technical and economic \nrisks through detailed analyses during project preparation, support for project implementation, \nand assurances from the Government. However, insufficient capacity of CPA and CHC to attract \nand retain staff skilled in IT remains a potential technical risk. Additional support will be provided \nthrough a loan-financed consultancy firm and a grant-financed advisory TA to train existing staff \nand formulate a human resource development plan to minimize that risk in the long run.  \n \n56.  It is assumed that growth in traffic will continue as projected. However, container traffic is \nhighly sensitive to external factors such as a decline in trade and/or an increase in nontariff \nbarriers, which are beyond the control of the port agencies. Regardless, it was found that the \nsensitivity of EIRR to traffic is marginal and the economic risks are minimal. \n \n57.  It  is  also  assumed  that  the  Government  will  support  the  respective  agencies  in \nimplementing the key aspects of the PEIP, such as relocating customs auctioning and container \nstuffing  activities  to  off-quay  sites,  needed  to  derive  the  long-term  cost  reductions.  TA  is \nprovided to enable the EAs meet those requirements. \n \n   ", "16  \n58.  An analysis of financial performance and projections of CPA (Appendix 10), which as a \nfinancially autonomous public entity is liable for repayment of the loan component, has shown \nthat operating revenues have grown by more than 10% a year on average over the past 6 \nyears. Hence, there is no appreciable risk associated with the lending.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.    Specific Assurances  \n \n59.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, CPA, CHC, and RHD have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n60.  Counterpart  Funding.  To  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment will provide, in a timely manner, its counterpart funds under the financing plan as \nwell as any additional funds that may be required to complete the Project.  \n \n61.  Port Efficiency Improvement Plan. CPA and CHC will take all actions necessary to \nincrease container yard capacity, revise port tariffs, improve port performance, develop human \nresources, and improve environmental quality according to the agreed schedule as outlined in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n62.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Prior  to  implementation,  each  EA  will  collect  relevant \nbaseline data required to monitor and evaluate impacts as outlined in the project performance \nmanagement system in Appendix 9. The EAs, with the assistance of construction supervision \nconsultants and other experts, will also continue to monitor project impacts with the necessary \nfrequency,  during  project  implementation,  and  2,  4,  and  6  years  after  completion.  During \nimplementation, the EAs will submit semi-annual reports to ADB.  \n \n63.  Environment. The Government will ensure that RHD will obtain site and operational \nclearances from the Department of Environment (DOE) prior to implementation of any civil \nworks activities. CPA will also obtain clearances prior to operationalization of the oil-waste \nseparation plant. To obtain these environmental clearances, CPA and RHD will submit the \nrequirements as described in the Environmental Conservation Act 1995 and the Environmental \nConservation Rule 1997. According to the instructions of the DOE, the oil waste will meet \neffluent standards for oil refineries without limitations on the amount of water discharged, but will \nmeet the limits on concentration of suspended solids, dissolved oxygenphenol, sulfides, oil, and \ngrease. CPA will obtain input from DOE on the design and implementation of the facilities.  \n \n64.  CPA and RHD will ensure that environmental mitigation measures described in the IEE \nreports are implemented throughout project implementation and operation, and in compliance \nwith the Bangladesh Environmental Conservation Act 1995 and other adopted environmental \npolicies  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  its  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). \n \n65.  Health  Risks. The Government will ensure that the civil works contracts include a \nrequirement to conduct an information and education campaign on communicable diseases, \nincluding but not limited to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for construction workers \nas part of the health and safety program at campsites during the construction period. The \nGovernment will also ensure that the civil works contracts include provisions on health, safety \nand  security,  sanitation  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including  accommodation, \naccidental  death,  dismemberment  and  disability  benefits,  and  clean  drinking  water  for \n ", "  17\nconstruction workers at campsites at standards acceptable to ADB during the construction \nperiod. The Government will also require each of CPA and RHD to provide to ADB a detailed \nreport on how each of the provisions herein is implemented by the civil works contractors. \n \n66.  Resettlement. The Government will ensure that RHD implement the short resettlement \nplan in accordance with all applicable government laws and regulations and in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and resettlement framework. This will include \nthe  following:  (i) compensation  will  be  provided  at  replacement  cost  together  with  any \nentitlements as stipulated in the short resettlement plan, with ADB\u2019s policy to prevail in the case \nof  any  difference  with  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations;  (ii) counterpart  funds  and \ndisbursements will be provided promptly to affected people, with agreed compensation provided \nto them before any land is taken or civil works contracts are awarded, and the Project will not \nuse any emergency provisions that allow land to be taken in advance of payment; (iv) RHD will \nguarantee  to  meet  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  budget  estimates;  (v) RHD  will \nimplement the Project with adequate supervision, monitoring, and reporting; (vi) a resettlement \nspecialist within the Project construction management consulting team will be charged with \nexternal monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement; (vii) resettlement fund disbursements \nand expenditures will be audited annually by an independent auditor; (viii) adequate information \ndissemination and consultation with affected people will be carried out; (ix) consultations and \ngrievances related to the Project will be documented; (x) resettlement plans will be updated if \nthe scope of the Project is changed; and (xi) progress will be regularly reported to ADB. \n \n67.  Grievance and Redress Mechanism. The Government will cause RHD to form within 3 \nmonths of the Effective Date an independent committee consisting of individuals unrelated to \nthe Project to hear any grievances or other complaints relating to resettlement or any other \nissues arising out of the implementation of the Project. Such a committee will have at least two \nmembers  who  are  women  and  a  member  who  is  a  representative  of  a  nongovernmental \norganization (NGO); one of the women members may be the NGO representative. Local media \nwill be invited to participate as observers and ask questions during meetings of the committee.  \nThe formation of the committee will be announced through the public media, such as daily \nBengali newspapers published in Chittagong. The committee will inform the public of its findings \nand recommendations through press releases for the local media within 3 months of the filing of \nany complaint.  In the event a press release is not published in the local media within two weeks \nof its release, the committee will publish the press release in the two largest daily Bengali \nnewspapers published out of Chittagong. \n \n68.  Labor Laws. The Government will cause each of RHD and CPA to ensure that the civil \nworks contractors comply with all applicable labor laws and regulations and do not employ child \nlabor in the construction activities. The Government will cause each of CPA and RHD to set \nemployment targets acceptable to ADB for women for road construction activities and will \nmonitor progress and cause its contractors to adhere to such targets. The Borrower will ensure \nthat each of CPA and RHD provides equal opportunities for women for road construction \nactivities, as well as require contractors not to differentiate wages between men and women for \nwork of equal value. The Government through CPA or RHD, as the case may be, will ensure \nthat a specific clause to this effect is included in all relevant bidding documents, and that \ncompliance is strictly monitored and documented during project implementation.  \n \n69.  Anticorruption.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake directly, or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the Project. The Government will fully cooperate and will ensure \n   ", "18  \nthat each of CPA, CHC, and RHD fully cooperates with any such investigation and each \nextends all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books and records as well as \nengagement of independent experts needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations. \nThe Government further acknowledges that all costs related to such investigations will be borne \nby the Project.  \n \n70.  The Government will ensure that within 6 months of the date of loan effectiveness, CPA \nwill establish a PSIC, chaired by the chairperson, CPA, to serve as a forum for discussing \nissues such as port tariffs, service quality, and development plans. PSIC will comprise port \nusers such as shipping agents and owners, freight forwarders, clearing agents, and chambers \nof commerce.  PSIC will establish procedures for receiving complaints and suggestions from \nport users and the general public.  PSIC will meet every 3 months, and CPA will provide \nminutes of all meetings to ADB within 2 weeks of every meeting. All government accredited \nmembers of the media will have access to the proceedings and minutes of PSIC meetings.  \nCPA will also, in consultation with representatives of CHC and members of PSIC, prepare an \nanticorruption strategy acceptable to ADB, which will be implemented during the remaining \nproject implementation period. \n \n71.  Indigenous  People.  The Government will ensure that no person will be adversely \naffected in terms of ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n72.  Performance Audit. The Government will cause an annual performance audit for each \nof the components of the Project to be completed. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n73.  Disbursement  for  the  CPA  component  will  be  subject  to  establishment  of  PSIC  and \nannouncement of its schedule of meetings. Following the first disbursement for this component, \nsubsequent disbursements will be subject to preparation by CPA of an anticorruption strategy \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n74.  Disbursement  for  the  RHD  component  will  be  subject  to  the  following  conditions: \nresettlement compensation will have been provided as stipulated in the resettlement plan; and \nthe independent committee for hearing grievances relating to resettlement under the Project will \nhave been established, and such establishment will have been announced through the public \nmedia such as daily Bengali newspapers published out of Chittagong.  \n \nVII.   RECOMMENDATION \n \n75.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$30,600,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Chittagong Port Trade Facilitation \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard.  \n \n                      TADAO CHINO \n                     President \n \n25 November 2004 \n ", "    Appendix 1  19\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nIndicators/Targets  Risks \nGoal       \nFacilitate trade   Annual percentage  Government provides \nchange in national GDP  GDP and other economic \nafter project completion  data from state statistics \n  bureau \nAnnual percentage   \nchange in trade after \nproject completion \n \nPurpose       \nIncrease container terminal  Annual growth in  CPA provides baseline,  Assumption: CHC and \ncapacity  container throughput  periodic, and post- CPA share and utilize \n  sustained at above 6% in  implementation survey  computer systems for \n  the first 6 years after  data  processing documents \nproject completion    and providing \n  information to port \nPort charges reduced by  users \n20% within 2 years of   \nproject completion  Assumption: CPA \n  revise port tariffs  \nVessel turnaround time   \nand berth occupancy rate   \nreduced by 20% within 2   \nyears of project \ncompletion \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  General Overview \n   \n1.  The transport system of Bangladesh consists of roads, railways, inland waterways, two \nseaports, maritime shipping, and civil aviation, catering to both domestic and international traffic. \nPresently there are about 21,000 kilometers (km) of paved roads; 2,706 route-kilometers of \nrailways; 3,800 km of perennial waterways, which increase to 6,000 km during the monsoon, \nand the ports of Mongla and Chittagong; and two international airports (Dhaka and Chittagong) \nand eight domestic airports.  \n \n2.  Development  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure  are  responsibilities  of  the \npublic sector as is provision of most rail and port services. Private sector involvement in road \nand inland water transport (IWT) and ocean shipping has increased considerably in recent \nyears. It is also gradually entering the domestic air transport and passenger rail markets as well \nas transport logistics. The inland waterway system (IWW) is limited due to geographic factors. \nThe presence of a large number of rivers without high-capacity bridges and the requirement to \nuse ferries result in the reliance on small trucks for both intra- and interurban distribution \nservices. The rail and road services are also constrained by network capacity and poor quality \nof infrastructure. Inadequate maintenance has led to severe deterioration of even major road \nand rail sections. Cost recovery levels of all modes are low due to numerous regulations and \nsubsidies. Asset replacement, in particular for the railways, is infrequent and unplanned. Thus, \nservice quality is low and unit costs of transport are high and rising. \n \n3.  The overall annual growth rate in the past 10 years has been nearly 8.2% for freight \ntransport and 8.4% for passenger transport. Even then, transport intensity is considerably lower \nthan in many developing countries. There is general recognition that the seaports in Bangladesh \nare  constrained  by  rigid  customs  regulations,  physical  capacity,  and  inadequate  hinterland \ntransport connectivity. It is manifested as congestion on the quays and the long port-to-door \ndelivery times. In summary, the hinterland transport system barely connects Dhaka\u2019s inland \ncontainer depot (ICD) and privately owned container storage depots across the country1 to the \ninternational trading gateways. \n \n  2.  Ports \n \n4.  Chittagong is the principal port, handling 85% of imports and 80% of exports. It is \nsituated in the estuary of the Karnaphuli river. The significance of this port is that it provides a \ndeep-water  anchorage  a  few  miles  inland  from  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  The  port  comprises \nChittagong container terminal (CCT) with two multipurpose (container and general cargo) berths \nspanning 450 meters and two general cargo berths (used mostly by container vessels), and the \ndedicated general cargo terminal with 11 berths, some of which are privately operated and \nhandle only break-bulk cargo,2 clinker, fertilizer, and other bulk cargo. The rededication of the \nlater berths for container handling is hardly possible under the present high berth-occupancy \n                                                 \n1  Babul, Hadi Hussain. 2003.

", "    Appendix 2  23\nrates.  However,  the  New  Mooring  container  terminal  (NMCT),  which  is  expected  to  be \noperational in early 2006, can more than double the container-handling capacity of the port.  \n \n5.  The port of Mongla is situated 85 km inland from the Pussur river entrance, which has a \ndynamic erosion and sedimentation profile. Cargo is almost entirely handled directly between \noceangoing vessels and inland river craft at the port's river moorings, which have deeper water \nthan alongside the port's berths. The port has 11 jetties, 7 shades for loading and unloading of \ngoods, and 8 warehouses. It uses 12 swinging moorings or floating berthing places in deeper \nsections of the river. The port has trade links with most of the major ports of the world, although \nvessels arriving there are mostly from ports in Asia. Mongla has lost a large part of its dynamics \ncompared with Chittagong, largely as a result of its physical constraints, including poor land and \nmaritime  accessibility.  In  the  last  10  years,  Mongla  has  lost  half  of  its  market  share  to \nChittagong, and now handles only about 15% of Bangladesh\u2019s seaborne trade. At present, \nabout 400 ships call at the port and it handles about 3 million tonnes of imports and exports \neach year, of which only a very small part is container cargo. \n \n6.  Operational and institutional constraints at the two ports render import cargo overpriced \nfor domestic consumers and export commodities less competitive on world markets. To correct \nthat  situation,  infrastructure  problems,  institutional  constraints  (such  as  paper-based \nmanagement  of  operations  and  port  labor  schemes),  poor  logistics  organization,  and \nnontransparency of transport and port-handling costs have to be addressed immediately. \n \n3.  Inland Transport \n \n    a.  Roads \n \n7.  There are five main road transport corridors in Bangladesh: (i) Dhaka-Chittagong, which \nis  the  major  national  freight  route;  (ii) Dhaka-Northwest  region,  which  is  the  second  most \nimportant  freight  route  with  Jamuna  bridge;  (iii) Dhaka-Khulna  region,  a  difficult  transport \ncorridor  with  a  major  ferry  at  Padma;  (iv) Dhaka-Sylhet  region,  mainly  for  transport  of \nconstruction material with Bhairab bridge; and (v) Khulna-Northwest region, a nondeveloped \ncorridor up the west side with a major ferry at Paksey. This latter corridor is Khulna bound for \nMongla port. \n \n8.  As evident from Table A2.1, road transport is the dominant mode of inland freight \ndistribution with a market share of over 70% in terms of tonnage carried. However, apart from \nthe localized operations in Chittagong and Dhaka, the amount of container movements in the \nnational road network is at present negligible. \n \n9.  Road  freight  services  are  offered  almost  exclusively  by  the  private  sector  (98%) \ncomprising mainly small transport companies. The standard transport unit is a 2-axle 7-tonne \ncapacity truck, with a gross vehicle weight of 12 tonnes. Overloading is a problem especially in \nrelation to semi-bulk products. Larger vehicles used for movement of heavier unit loads such as \ncontainers are not common and are mainly used for local transport or limited intercity operations \nalong the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor. Recently private companies have increased their fleet of \nheavy trucks for carrying containers to and from Chittagong.

Key issues for port\u2019s efficiency: development of inland distribution system \n(road, rail & inland waterways in Bangladesh. Chittagong. \n \n    b.  Rail \n \n10.  The rail system is principally divided into broad gauge in the west of the country and \nmeter gauge in the east. The sector has suffered a decline in freight traffic and its market share \nhas dropped from around 30% to an estimated 7% at present, mostly due to the growth in \nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, for which road transport can provide a more frequent \nand  reliable  service.  Even  for  bulk  traffic  movements,  obsolete  rail  wagons  and  speed \nrestrictions have made rail increasingly unattractive. These problems are compounded by thefts \nand the necessity for frequent safety checks, thus increasing transit times and congestion on \nthe dominantly single-track system. As it is, only the Dhaka-Chittagong route is cost-effective for \ninland distribution. However, the recent rail links of Rajsahi-Joydevpur and Khulna-Joydevpur \nover Jamuna bridge have opened up an opportunity to cater to the rail-borne traffic in the \nnorthern and southern regions of the country. \n \n    c.  Inland Waterways \n \n11.  IWW has an important role in transport due to the large network. Both Chittagong and \nMongla ports are dependent on IWT for the movement of bulk and semi-bulk products. At \nMongla, most of the tonnage handled at the port is distributed by IWT, although there are some \nnavigational constraints in the IWW from Mongla to Dhaka-Narayanganj. While IWT has long \nbeen used for distribution of bulk and break-bulk cargoes, transportation of containers has not \ndeveloped due to the lack of appropriate river terminals in Dhaka and other freight centers. \nMoreover, the river is passable only for vessels with a maximum draught of 4 meters. \n \n12.  At present, IWT provides services to outer anchorages, and facilitates inland distribution \nof products from specialized terminals\u2014oil, grain, fertilizer, clinker, etc.\u2014and overside working \nof semi-bulk vessels in the port. The vessels used for IWT are mainly bay-crossing cargo \nvessels and, despite the fact that intermodal operational arrangements would enable cargoes to \nbe  transported  from  door-to-door,  it  has  not  yet  played  a  major  role  in  the  transport  of \ncontainers. The lack of a dedicated terminal facility at Dhaka is also a major problem. However, \nif the necessary operational arrangements are established, IWT could be a real alternative to \nroad and rail. A riverside container terminal is under construction at Khanpur by a private \ncompany on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis, and a public terminal is also being built at \nPaangooan.  These  terminals,  both  situated  in  the  Dhaka-Narayanganj  area,  will  have  an ", "    Appendix 2  25\nestimated  annual  capacity  of  respectively  60,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEUs)  and \n120,000 TEUs and could attract a share of over 10% of Chittagong-originated container traffic. \n \n4.  Dhaka-Chittagong Corridor \n \n13.  The  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor  contributes  annually  about  30%  to  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP). Demand for transport in the corridor is already exceeding capacity and causing \nmajor delays to passengers and freight. Traffic on Dhaka-Chittagong highway, most of which is \ntwo-lane, is about 16,000 vehicles per day (33,000 passenger car equivalent units [PCUs]).3 \nRail  carries  about  15%  of  the  transport  along  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor,  including \ncontainers and bulk cargo. It is Bangladesh Railways\u2019 (BR) most profitable freight segment, \nadding about 22% to annual freight revenues. \n \n14.  About 80% of freight traffic in the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor is moved by trucks, but little \nin containers. The only ICD in the country is in Dhaka, but only about 10% of the import \ncontainers are handled there although 70% of the import and export cargo either originates from \nor terminates in Dhaka. Cargo is usually unstuffed at the port or the few nearby container \ndepots and then transported by small trucks in break-bulk form. This is not only wasteful in \nterms of resources, as each container is loaded in 3-4 trucks, but also defeats the economic \nbenefits of containerization. Moreover, cargo is open to more pilfering and damage in transit.  \n \n15.  Customs allows containers to be transported to Dhaka ICD by rail under the original bill \nof lading and the consumers can take delivery at the ICD or at premises at their choice. The \nservice is hassle free, cheaper than road, and popular. However, BR is currently able to capture \nonly a fraction of the Dhaka-Chittagong traffic (about 43,100 TEUs or less than 10% of the total \nin 2002) due to capacity constraints\u2014line capacity is limited by sections of single track between \nDhaka and Chittagong and inadequate wagons. Services are limited to two daily container-\ntrains transporting about 60 TEUs each. Consequently, containers now have to wait up to 10 \ndays to be able to secure a place on trains. It is likely that, in light of such severe congestion, \nthere will not be a substantial increase in rail traffic on these lines until the ADB-financed Rail \nSector Development Project, aimed at establishing a double track for the entire rail line between \nDhaka and Chittagong, is complete in 2009. \n \n16.  An  estimated  cost  comparison  of  the  three  freight  haulage  systems  for  container \ntransport is shown in Table A2.2. It is clear that IWT is the cheapest, but even if full costing \nprinciples are used to include environmental and social costs in the analysis, the time cost may \npreclude a shift in the high-value traffic, which is currently moved by road and rail.  \n \n17.  Following the promulgation of guidelines for development of private ICDs by the National \nBoard of Revenue in 1998, investors have constructed 11 ICDs in and around Chittagong with a \ntotal capacity of 22,215 TEUs. Under the present regulations, private ICDs are used only for \nstuffing export and storage of empty containers, but not as container freight stations (CFS) for \nimport cargo. In addition, restrictions on siting of private ICDs to 20 km from the port is also \ndiscouraging potential investors, especially because appropriate land is unavailable within that \narea.  \n \n                                                 \n3  The typical average daily volume to maintain a level of service of C (average speed 84 km/h during the 30 most \ncongested hours per annum) on a similar road with 12% trucks should not exceed 26,000 PCUs. ", "26 Appendix 2 \nB.  Chittagong Port Authority \n \n18.  The port\u2019s administration was first legalized with the Port Commissioner\u2019s Act of 1887. \nThe Port Commissioners and Port Railway jointly administered the port until July 1960 when it \nwas reorganized as Chittagong Port Trust, thus ending the dual administration of the port by the \ntwo agencies. In order to provide more autonomy to the port\u2019s management, Chittagong Port \nAuthority (CPA) was established in September 1976 as an organizational unit of the Ministry of \nShipping.  \n \nTable A2.2: Cost Comparison of the Three Modes of Transport \n($) \n \nItem  Containerized  Break Bulk via  Containerized \nCargo via ICD  Road  Cargo via IWW \n(Rail) \n1.

Port management responsibilities are vested in a board comprising a chairperson and \nthree members who are appointed by the Government. There is also an advisory committee \nconsisting of representatives from port users, Bangladesh Navy, customs, Bangladesh National \nRailway (BNR), Inland Water Transport Authority, and Chittagong City Corporation. CPA owns, \nmaintains, and operates all vessel- and cargo-handling facilities in Chittagong. However, there \nis no regular forum or channels of communication or dialogue among key port users and port \nmanagement.  \n \n20.  CPA\u2019s organization consists of three divisions reporting to the chairperson: operations, \nengineering, and finance, with a total employment level of 8,489 salaried employees and blue-\ncollar workers and laborers. In addition to the three divisions, six departments report to the \nchairperson. In terms of the number of employees, the traffic department is the largest with a \nstaff level of 2,014. While there are over 200 highly qualified technical personnel assigned to the \nengineering, planning, and finance departments, low wage levels and lengthy procedures for \nchanging job classifications have precluded CPA from recruiting new staff with special skills. \nHowever, the educational levels and general interest among existing staff make them suitable \ncandidates to be retrained. Moreover, staff have received informal training and exposure to \nmodern port management and operational practices, and are genuinely eager to have new \npractices introduced to the port. ", "    Appendix 2  27\n21.  With the enactment of the Financial Act of 2000, CPA became a corporate entity entitled \nto retain control of its revenues and expenses, and was obligated to pay income taxes to the \nGovernment. In fiscal year (FY) 2000/01, CPA paid income taxes of $5.14 million. Its foreign \ncurrency earnings in 2002/03 amounted to $42.33 million, which constituted 49% of its total \nrevenue. \n \nC.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Recent Trends \n \n22.  Container-handling operations at Chittagong started in 1976/77 when 6 TEUs (all 20-foot \ncontainers) were imported. At that time there were no specialized facilities or equipment to \nhandle containers. The rapid growth of container traffic has surpassed all expectations, reaching \nin excess of 121,000 TEUs in 1991/92 and more than 560,000 TEUs in 2002/03 (Table A2.3).  \n \nTable A2.3: Container Traffic Projections  \n(1,000 TEUs) \n \n  High Growth (9%)  Moderate Growth (6.4%)  Low Growth (3.2%) \nYear  Import  Export  Total  Import Export Total  Import  Export Total \n2002/03  279.33  281.16  560.49  279.33  281.16  560.49  279.33  281.16  560.49 \n2003/04  304.47  306.46  610.93  297.21  299.15  596.36  288.27  290.16  578.43 \n2004/05  331.87  334.05  665.92  316.23  318.30  634.53  297.49  299.44  596.94 \n2005/06  361.74  364.11  725.85  336.47  338.67  675.14  307.01  309.02  616.04 \n2006/07  394.30  396.88  791.18  358.00  360.35  718.35  316.84  318.91  635.75 \n2007/08  429.78  432.60  862.38  380.91  383.41  764.32  326.98  329.12  656.09 \n2008/09  468.46  471.53  940.00  405.29  407.95  813.24  337.44  339.65  677.09 \n2009/10  510.63  513.97  1024.60  431.23  434.06  865.29  348.24  350.52  698.76 \n2010/11  556.58  560.23  1116.81  458.83  461.83  920.66  359.38  361.74  721.12 \n2011/12  606.67  610.65  1217.32  488.19  491.39  979.59  370.88  373.31  744.19 \n2012/13  661.28  665.61  1326.88  519.44  522.84  1042.28  382.75  385.26  768.01 \n2013/14  720.79  725.51  1446.30  552.68  556.30  1108.99  395.00  397.59  792.58 \n2014/15  785.66  790.81  1576.47  588.05  591.91  1179.96  407.64  410.31  817.95 \n2015/16  856.37  861.98  1718.35  625.69  629.79  1255.48  420.68  423.44  844.12 \n2016/17  933.44  939.56  1873.00  665.73  670.09  1335.83  434.14  436.99  871.13 \n2017/18  1017.45  1024.12  2041.57  708.34  712.98  1421.32  448.04  450.97  899.04 \n2018/19  1109.03  1116.29  2225.32  753.67  758.61  1512.29  462.37  465.40  927.78 \n2019/20  1208.84  1216.76  2425.60  801.91  807.16  1609.07  477.17  480.30  957.46 \nSource: TA Consultant based on growth rates provided by Chittagong Port Authority (CPA). 2002/03 figures \nrepresent actual traffic. \n \n23.  During the first 9 months of 2003/04 (until the end of March 2004) the port\u2019s container \ntraffic reached 487,252 TEUs. On an annualized basis, this volume translates to 650,000 TEUs, \na 15.9% increase over 2002/03. \n \n \n24.  Containers are handled at the two multipurpose berths at jetties 9 through 13 and at \nCCT. The onshore container-handling system consists of forklift and straddle-carrier systems. At \nthe general cargo berths (GCB), tractor-trailers are used to move containers between the quay \nand the yard. Forklifts are used to move containers in the yard. At CCT, the straddle-carrier \nsystem is used for both yard operations and transferring containers between the quays and \nyards. \n ", "28 Appendix 2 \n25.  The number of TEUs increased by 14.9% annually during the 12-year period 1991/92 to \n2002/03. The corresponding increases in tonnes and the number of container ships are 15.5% \nand 6.7% per year, respectively. The lower rate of growth in the number of ships in relation to \nTEUs or tons resulted in a corresponding increase in the average number of TEUs or tons per \nship. From 1991/92 to 2002/03, the average number of TEUs per ship increased from 388 to \n874 and the average number of tonnes from 3,458 to 8,271.  \n \n26.  In terms of TEUs, import/export traffic is nearly balanced. However, in terms of tonnes, \nthe traffic is not balanced with an import/export ratio of approximately 5:2. This is also reflected \nin the average weight per TEUs for imports at 13.3 tonnes and for exports at 5.6 tonnes, in \n2002/03.  This  disparity  is  due  to  the  large  number  of  export  containers  shipped  empty, \nconfirming that the port is primarily an import port for containerized cargo as in the case of bulk \nand general cargoes. In 2002/03 for example, 111,051 empty TEUs were exported (39% of \nTEUs exports), whereas only 11,404 empty TEUs were imported (4% of TEUs imports). \n \n2.  Customs Interface \n \n27.  The customs operations are primarily paper-based with some computerization in the \nform of 1 of 6 ASYCUDA modules running. From a port operations perspective, however, the \nkey problems relate to customs regulations dealing with the stripping of containers. For security \nreasons, customs requires that all CFS operations take place inside the port area. Customs also \nrequires cleared full container load (FCL) containers to be unstuffed inside the port area. These \nactivities are slowing down operations at CCT due to inadequate space. They occupy from 20% \nto 40% of CCT operating space, depending on the time of day. Two reasons are provided for \nthis practice: first, customs regards the containers themselves as dutiable items and second, a \ncustoms officer is required to observe the cargo as it is removed from the container to see if it \ncontains contraband. The former reason is in contrast to international norms and the second is \nprimarily a result of not having an adequate computerized risk assessment system in place to \ndetermine which containers should be inspected. \n \n28.  The container stripping process is slowed further by the archaic system used to handle \ncargo in the warehouse. Cargo is placed in a semi-organized manner on the floor requiring 98 \nclerks to sort everything out. All accounting and inventory control is done by hand. The average \ndwell time in the warehouse is 10 days. The loading of the outbound trucks is also a very slow \nprocess. These operations interfere with the yard movements. \n \n29.  The practice of stripping both less than container load (LCL) and FCL containers within \nCCT contributes significantly to the 18-day average dwell time that is characteristic of current \noperations. It also generates delays that reverberate throughout container operations. Yet it is \nan artificial contrivance. In most modern ports these operations are carried out in off-dock \nfacilities. Even in many ports lacking computerized clearance systems, the boxes move to the \noff-dock facility using internal transit procedures. \n \n30.  While the negative consequences of these customs requirements on the port and CCT \noperations  are  enormous,  Customs  House  of  Chittagong  (CHC)  and  its  central  ministry \n(National Board of Revenue within the Ministry of Finance) are planning to relocate the customs \nwarehouse and auction house to an off-dock site just north of the Port Park. The Port Park in \nitself is a facility being constructed by CPA to handle CFS and some FCL containers. It is \nexpected to be complete by January 2006. \n ", "    Appendix 2  29\n  3.  Labor \n \n31.  The port is an important contributor to employment in the Chittagong region. Direct \nemployment  by  the  CPA  totals  approximately  8,500  jobs.  In  addition,  the  port  creates \nemployment for 6,200 dockworkers, 5,300 merchant laborers, and 3,000 stevedoring workers. \nThere are as many as 23,000 workers involved in different activities in different sections of the \nport. \n \n32.  There are two areas where unskilled labor is employed: in the operations on the quay, \nand in the CFS and FCL container stripping operations. The gang sizes for those activities tend \nto be excessive: in container loading/unloading operations a gang includes about 12 workers \nwhere only 2 or 3 would be needed. Given the low wages, this has little impact on cost, but \nefficiency is lowered when too many persons are handling equipment and cargo.  \n \n33.   Recently, CPA and the Government started to gradually reduce the labor force through \nmutually agreed retirement compensation. The process is very similar to those conducted in \nmost of the ports in the world, where technological improvements in port operations created \nlarge redundancies in both port employees and dockers. Although costly, this has been proving \na successful model for reducing long-term costs and improving productivity. The Government \nalso plans to introduce a system of performance-based remuneration, which will eliminate the \nsystem of informal earnings. \n \n  4.  Port Environmental Management \n \n34.  CPA is surrounded by many industrial plants and almost all of them discharge untreated \nwastes into the Karnaphuli river. In addition, intentional discharging and accidental spillages of \noil and oily substances (e.g., bilge) from ships occur almost weekly. Sometimes, oil pollution in \nthe river becomes noticeable. However, due to strong currents, wind, and wave action the oil \ndissipates fast. It reaches the riverbanks, and stains the vegetation along the river. Although \naround 1,700 ocean ships and 4,000\u20135,000 coastal ships (on average five ocean ships and 15 \ncoastal ships daily in 2003) call on Chittagong now (and will increase in the future), there is no \nroutine  monitoring  of  oil  pollution  within  CPA\u2019s  area  jurisdiction  and  there  is  no  pollution \nmonitoring along the river. Water samples taken from the river in March 2004 at 10 different \nsites within CPA\u2019s area jurisdiction have confirmed that the oil and grease content range from \n30\u2013338 parts per million (ppm), exceeding the allowable limits. \n \n35.  The  existing  government  regulations  have  established  comprehensive  standards  for \nindustries to fight pollution. However, enforcement is weak. In this regard, pressure due to \ninternational requirements on environmental management is pushing individual industries to \ninternalize their environmental problems. As for the port sector, the Government has ratified the \nconvention on Marine Pollution (MARPOL) 73/78, which came into effect in September 2003.  \n \n36.  At present, CPA is not fully equipped to comply with MARPOL 73/78 in terms of facilities, \nequipment, or staff. MARPOL 73/74 covers the 1954 Oil Pollution Convention that requires \ncontracting parties to take all appropriate steps to promote the provision of facilities for the \nreception of oily wastewater. Aside from prevention of pollution by oil, the convention is also \nintended to address other forms of pollution from ships such as (i) noxious liquid, (ii) harmful \nsubstances in packaged form, (iii) sewage, (iv) solid wastes, and (v) air pollution. It is, therefore, \nnecessary for CPA to have as a starting point an oily waste reception facility. Having this facility \nwill force CPA to allocate resources for improving their environmental performance, which will \nstrengthen Chittagong port\u2019s competitiveness.  ", "30 Appendix 2 \n \n  5.  Container Traffic Projections \n \n37.  CPA recently prepared cargo throughput projections for container traffic as well as for \nother cargoes. They are based on alternative levels of high, moderate, and low annual growth \nrate assumptions of 9%, 6.4%, and 3.2%, respectively. Considering the annual 14.9% growth \nrate  of  container  traffic  expressed  in  TEUs  during  the  last  12  years,  these  growth  rates \nrepresent realistic trends, even if a reduction in exports will follow the expiration of the Multifiber \nArrangement at the end of 2004. Besides, the economy is expected to grow at an average of \nabout 5%, and if the rule-of-thumb estimate of twice the GDP growth is used, the 9% growth \nseems realistic. The growth rate experienced in the last 12 years is well above average for a \nport of its size and is indicative of the changing pattern of the nation\u2019s foreign trade.  \n \n38.  Based on the assumed growth rates, Table A2.3 shows the projected TEUs for the 15-\nyear period from 2003/04 to 2019/20. Under the high growth rate assumption, the port is \nexpected to handle 2.4 million TEUs in 2019/20. In the case of moderate and low growth rates, \nthe corresponding figures are 1.6 million and 957,000 TEUs, respectively. \n \nFigure A2.1: Traffic Growth Forecast \n \n3,000\n2,500\ns\nU High\nE 2,000\nT\n \nd Moderate\nn 1,500\na\ns Low\nu 1,000\no\nh\nT\n500\n0\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nYear\nHigh Growth Moderate Growth Low Growth\n \n \nD.   Opportunities for Improving Port Sector Efficiency \n \n39.  In recent years, the Government has been progressively implementing a number of \ninstitutional reforms and operational improvements intended to improve port sector efficiency. \nPrivate sector participation in port-related activities has substantially evolved and now includes: \n(i) operation of specialized cargo terminals; (ii) operation of warehouses; (iii) construction and \noperation of 11 CFSs and ICDs in and around the port of Chittagong and a major (IWT bound) \nICD  near  Dhaka,  at  present  under  construction;  (iv) fuel  storage  facilities  and  tank  farms; ", "    Appendix 2  31\n(v) ownership and operation of container-handling equipment; (vi) dry docking and ship repair \nfacilities; (vii) pilotage; and (viii) river dredging operations. \n \n40.  Several public investments are also currently under way or in preparation to improve \ntransport  infrastructure  on  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor.  These  are:  (i) the  ADB-financed \ndouble-tracking of the Dhaka-Chittagong rail corridor to increase capacity and speed of rail \nservices; (ii) the ADB-financed Chittagong Port Access Road, which will provide a direct link \nbetween Dhaka-Chittagong highway and the port; (iii) the planned widening of the two-lane \nDhaka-Chittagong national highway to a four-lane facility, of which the initial 28 km have been \ncompleted; and (iv) the construction of two new ICDs\u2014one public and one private under a BOT \ncontract\u2014at Dhaka-Narayanganj to serve IWT of containers.  \n \n41.  CPA  has  also  started  an  important  program  of  public  investment  to  meet  its \nmodernization requirements: \n \n(i)  A new 1,000-meter container quay (NMCT) with a capacity of 500,000 TEUs is \nunder construction with completion date set for 2006. NMCT will be equipped \nwith six to eight gantry cranes and a 220,000 square meter back-up area. These \nwill help increase the speed of container handling and lower ship turnaround \ntime, which will in turn lead to lower freight rates.  \n \n(ii)  Four gantry cranes are being procured for CTC, and will be operational by the \nend of 2005. Current efficiency levels at CTC are very poor. Throughput per ship \nday in container operations is a low 178 boxes, and average turnaround time of \nvessels is 4.8 days, including a service time of 3.2 days. These indicators are \nexpected to improve substantially with the entry into service of the new cranes. \n \n(iii)  A total of 13 straddle carriers, 12 reach stackers, 22 trailers, 6 rubber tired \ngantries and other minor container-handling equipment have been mobilized in \nthe last 5 years. \n \n42.  A private firm will operate the NMCT under a concession contract. This will be the first \nprivately operated container terminal in Bangladesh. CPA expects the operator to establish high \nproductivity targets, which will have a general positive impact on CCT operations. Competition \nbetween private-operated NMCT  and CPA-operated CCT will raise the need to guarantee \ntransparency  and  fair  practices.  Improved  efficiency  will  also  have  an  impact  on  labor \nproductivity, thus paving the way for labor union rationalization. \n \n43.  Under  the  Customs  Administration  Modernization  (CAM-1),  CHC  has  shifted  all  its \nimport groups into the customs hall room and under ASYCUDA++ operations. Although certain \nsystem modules are not activated to reap the full benefits of computerization, 50% of importers \ncan now clear cargo within 24 hours after (CAM-1) project, while others may take 2 to 3 days.  \n \n44.  To realize the full potential of the planned physical and technological enhancements, \nother procedural and organizational changes are needed. They include the development of the \nworkforce,  modernization  of  selected  customs  procedures,  reform  to  port  tariffs,  and \nimprovements  to  port  environmental  management.  Activities  ongoing  in  that  regard  are \nsummarized in Table A2.4. \n ", "32 Appendix 2 \nTable A2.4: Government Initiatives to Facilitate Trade \nAction Taken  Purpose \nDiscussions between CPA and CHC about  Increase container terminal capacity \nrelocating customs warehouse and auction \nhouse \nConstruction of the Port Park  Relocate CFS and FCL activities to increase \ncontainer terminal capacity \nMinistry of Shipping plan to rationalize labor  Increase labor productivity \nunions \nReview of port tariffs  Enable better billing using CTMS \nCreation of the national anticorruption  Investigate and penalize guilty parties  \ncommittee \nCFS \u2013 container freight station, CHC \u2013 Customs House of Chittagong, CPA \u2013 Chittagong Port Authority,  \nCTMS \u2013 container terminal management system, FCL- full container load  ", "    Appendix 3  33\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PORT SECTOR \n \n    Loan/TA Amount   \nSource                Project Name  (in funding agency  Date Approved \ncurrency, million) \nADB        \nLoans:       \n143 BAN (SF)  Improvement and rehabilitation of  $ 3.20  18 Oct 1973 \nrailway track within port area. \n144 BAN   Construction of one warehouse and  $ 3.60  18 Oct 1973 \n  rehabilitation of 5 transit sheds \n  behind jetties 1-6. \nTAs:       \nTA 96 BAN  Chittagong Port Project  $ 0.16  1973 \nTA 2863 BAN  Ports Upgrading Project  $ 0.29  May 1998 \nTA 4136 BAN  Chittagong Port Trade Facilitation  $ 0.50  16 Mar 2004 \nProject (CPTFP)   \nJBIC  Procurement of telecommunications  \u00a530.0  11 May 1976 \nequipment    \nWorld Bank       \nTAs:       \nIDA 622 (TA-III)  Port Development Project   $ 0.50   1979 \nIDA 872 (TA-III)  Port Development Project   $ 0.95   1979 \nIDA 1124 (TA-IV)  Port Development Project   SDR 0.03  1983 \nIDA-2393 (TA-VI)  Port system development plan : trade  $ 0.98   21 May 1992 \n  facilitation study and master plan.    \nLoans:       \nIDA Credit # 424   Crude oil landing system  $ 1.60  10 Aug 973 \n \n \nIDA Credit #1096   Trial dredging in river Karnaphuli   $ 4.23  13 Feb 1981 \n \nIDA Credit #1247  Construction of 2 multipurpose berths  SDR 33.00  21 May 1982 \nand procurement of cargo-handling   \nequipment \n \nIDA Credit #1504-2 BD  Construction of 2 multipurpose berths  SDR 6.32   25 Jul 1984 \n(Supplemental)  and procurement of cargo-handling   \nequipment \nFrance (Credit)  Procurement of one trailing suction     \n(Bangladesh French  hopper dredger      \nFinancial Protocol) :  (i) Financial Protocol\u20141983  FF   47.40  7 May 1983 \n(ii) Financial Protocol\u20141987  FF   93.00   \n(iii) Financial Protocol\u20141989  FF     7.05  2 Jun 1987 \nFF  147.45   \n12 Jun 1991 \nFinland (Grants)  Construction of 2 multipurpose berths     \nand procurement of cargo-handling     \nequipment:    25 Aug 1984 \n-  interim container-handling  FIM 71.41   \nequipment      \n-  Moheshkhal  bridge   FIM  0.89  19 Feb 1988 \n-  5 weighbridges  FIM  3.60   \n21 Sep 1989 \n \nContinued on next page ", "34 Appendix 3 \n    Loan/TA Amount   \nSource                Project Name  (in funding agency  Date Approved \ncurrency, million) \nNetherlands (Grants)  1.Procurement of one High Powered  NLG  2.72  23 Jul 2000 \n  Tug (3200 BHP)   \n  2.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project has three main physical interventions: (i) construction of a connector road to link \nChittagong  container  terminal  (CCT)  and  New  Mooring  container  terminal  (NMCT)  with  the \nChittagong port access road (CPAR); (ii) upgrading internal roads and the bridge between CCT and \ngeneral cargo berths (GCB), and construction of the port service road (PSR) and a bridge linking \nthe  port  and  the  proposed  Port  Park;  and  (iii) installation  of  a  waste-oil  separation  plant  and \nconstruction of a building (around 1,500 square meters (m2) consisting of a laboratory, storage \nroom for oil-spill clearance equipment, and office space for the new environmental unit. Based on \nthese physical interventions, the Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d Project in accordance with the \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Based  on  the \nEnvironmental Conservation Rules (ECR) 1997, the road component is categorized as an \u201cAmber A \nor B\u201d project, while the oil-waste separation plant has no categorization under the ECR. However, \nsite clearance and environmental clearance to operate the plant need to be obtained from the \nDepartment of Environment (DOE). On these bases, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared from January to June 2004, but the detailed engineering drawings are yet to be prepared. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The details of Project activities are summarized in Table A5.1 below: \n \nTable A5.1: Summary of Project Activities \n \nProject Component  Detailed Activities \n1  Road linking CCT and NMCT with  \u2022  Construction of 1.7 kilometers of new road \nCPAR  with  a 960-meter flyover \n2  Internal roads and bridges  \u2022  Construction of a 900-meter service road \n\u2022  Construction of 2 bridges: (i) 55-meter \nbridge over Mohesh Khal, and (ii) bridge on \nthe PSR \n3  Waste-oil separator and building  \u2022  Construction of pontoon moorings at the \n(around 1,500 square meters)  oil-waste reception facilities \ncomprising laboratory, office space,  \u2022  Installation of oil-waste separator  \nand storage room for oil-spill  \u2022  Construction of building \nclearance equipment \nCCT = Chittagong container terminal, CPAR = Chittagong Port Access Road, NMCT = New Mooring container \nterminal, PSR = Port Service Road, \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Environment \n \n3.  The city of Chittagong and surrounding areas, including the project site, are coastal areas. \nThese areas are mainly plain land at an elevation of about 3\u20134 meters above sea level. Cyclonic \nstorms frequently hit this coastal region during monsoon periods. The soil condition in the project \narea is stable with no erosion problems and groundwater can be found at 3\u20135 meter depths. Deep \ntubewell water is fresh and free from salinity, but the shallow underground water is susceptible to ", "38 Appendix 5 \nseawater intrusion due to its proximity to the bay of Bengal. The area of the proposed physical \nworks is considered to be within a seismic risk zone.  \n \n4.  The Chittagong port area is located on the banks of Karnaphuli estuary, and is a nursing \nground for many species of fish and varieties of marine life. The river is favorable for migratory fish. \nHowever,  the  water  quality  and  fish  population  have  been  drastically  lowered.  Many  polluting \nindustries discharge untreated effluent directly into the river. Untreated city sewage together with \nmany other wastes such as storm run-off and wastewater from various ships and port activities go \ndirectly into the river, causing frequent localized pollution. In addition, oil spills from ships occur at \nleast once a week. The movement of the migratory fish in the river has declined also due to \ninterference from seagoing vessels, port activity, construction of the Kaptai dam, reclamation, and \nconstruction of large-scale fertilizer industries, etc., in the coastal areas. \n \n5.  The project area does not have any forests, though within a 10-kilometer (km) radius of the \nproject site, a small patch of mangroves comprising a mainly new plantation of kewra can be found. \nThere is no endangered wildlife reported in the project area, but a large number of different birds \nare seen in the mangrove forest. The nearest forest area is in Sitakhunda thana (fortress), which is \napproximately 30 km away from the project area. \n \n2.  Sociocultural Aspects  \n \n6.  The project site lies in Bandar thana of Chittagong district. This thana covers an area of 44.6 \nsquare kilometers (km2) with 30,726 households and a population of 187,739. The population \ndensity is 4,207/km2. The people of this thana are engaged in different types of activities for \nlivelihood.  Nearly  5%  of  the  population  is  engaged  in  agriculture,  53%  in  services,  12%  in \ncommerce, and 3 % in nonagricultural labor. The productivity of the industries and means of \nlivelihood are favorable so the general economic condition of the people is good. Nearly 3,000\u2013\n4,000 people are engaged in fishing in the Karnaphuli river and the estuarine areas. \n \n7.  The major sources of drinking water are tap, tubewells, and dug wells followed by ponds \nand rivers. Most of the households of the Bandar colony (77% of total households) use tap water, \nwhereas 87% of households in Madhya Halishahar and 74% of households in Dakshin Halishahar \nuse tubewell water for drinking. About 50% of the total households in the project area use sanitary \nlatrine facilities, 47% use nonsanitary latrines, while 3% use open places for defecation. \n \n8.  There  are  no  historical,  cultural,  or  archaeological  places  of  importance  in  the  areas \nsurrounding the Project. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n9.  No environmental impacts are expected in association with the siting or location of the \nProject  because  it  is  located  within  the  existing  port  jurisdiction  and  not  in  the  coastal  area. \nHowever,  the  construction  of  the  road  from  CPAR  to  CCT  will  involve  an  area  that  is  now \nencroached by local communities. The resettlement plan to handle this matter has been prepared \nseparately.  \n \n10.  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  road  component  mostly  relate  to \nconstruction works. The impacts will include: (i) loss of tress due to land clearing, (ii) disruption of \ntraffic in the construction area and main road of Chittagong port area due to the movement of \nconstruction equipment and vehicles, (iii) increased air pollution due to increasing dust from the \nearth work, (iv) noise and vibration, and (v) disruption of water system due to construction. All these ", "    Appendix 5  39\nimpacts will occur only during the construction period. The mitigation measures to deal with the \nimpacts associated with the construction phase include: (i) rerouting traffic with clear signs and by \nmoving equipment and vehicles as much as possible by rail, (ii) maintaining optimum moisture \ncontent during handling of soil, and spraying adequate water to minimize dust, (iii) strictly controlling \nthe  construction  works  that  create  noise  and  vibration  by  prohibiting  night  work,  (iv) pumping \nstagnant water and providing an adequate drainage system, and (v) locating storage areas for \nconstruction materials away from water bodies and river banks. These mitigation requirements will \nbe included in the contract documents for the contractors. Clearly, these impacts are temporary and \nmanageable. Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) will \nimplement these mitigation measures for each activity under their responsibility.  \n \n11.  The  camps  for  construction  workers  will  be  placed  in  areas  to  avoid  social  conflict. \nFurthermore, the camps will be provided with adequate sanitation and waste management facilities \nto avoid disruption to the communities. Construction material that contains hazardous and toxic \nsubstances such as petroleum and lubricants will be stored in proper places and managed in \naccordance with government standards.  \n \n12.  The environmental impact associated with the operation of the road component is expected \nto be positive, because the new road is expected to ease traffic movement and it will lead to lower \nvehicle  emissions.  The  potential  negative  impact  is leakage  and  spillage  of  hazardous  goods \ntransported by truck. CPA and RHD will work with other relevant government agencies as well as \nthe community to develop a safety plan.  A separate plan will be prepared by RHD and CPA to \nreduce traffic pollution and noise by minimizing the exit/entry points from the port (gates) and \nchanneling traffic to the Chittagong Port Access Road.  \n \n13.  The impacts associated with the construction of the oil-waste separation plant will be very \nminimal, and will be confined within CPA\u2019s jurisdictional area. However, since the location of this is \nonly about 100 meters from the main road connecting Chittagong city to the airport, it is expected \nthat traffic congestion will worsen during the construction period. Therefore, adequate traffic signs \nand rerouting of traffic may be necessary. The environmental impacts associated with the operation \nof the plant will be positive. The waste oil from ships will be received and treated at the plant, and \neffluent discharged from the plant will be designed to meet the Bangladesh standards for effluent \nfrom oil-related activities. This is expected to eliminate the impact of ships on the water quality in \nKarnaphuli. Moreover, the oil separated from the wastewater could be sold in the open market. In \nthis context, the supervision consultant for this subproject component will also undertake a study of \nthe potential uses for the oil and sludge derived from the separator. The sludge is not expected to \nbe significant in volume terms and is also expected not to have any oil substances. However, \nroutine tests on the quality of sludge will be carried out to ensure that there are no oil and toxic \nsubstances, and therefore the sludge can be disposed of at the municipal disposal sites. The \nsludge will be collected in drums and stored in the plant area in special ways to avoid leaks and \nspills.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n  1.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility \n \n14.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the contractors. An environmental engineer, hired as part of the consultant team for \nimplementing the Project, will assist RHD and CPA to prepare contractual documentation so that \nthe bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other obligations of the contractors clearly identify \nenvironmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  The  environmental ", "40 Appendix 5 \nengineer will also assist RHD and CPA to monitor and supervise the contractor in implementing \nmitigation measures. CPA and RHD will be responsible for implementing the overall environmental \nmonitoring and management plan as part of the IEE for the oil-separation/treatment facility and the \nconnector road, respectively. \n \n2.  Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n \n15.  The IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will be part \nof the mitigation of the adverse impacts. Detailed location and timing to undertake the monitoring \nwork are also identified. For the road subcomponent, during the construction phase, RHD\u2019s and \nCPA\u2019s environmental monitoring will focus on the implementation of the mitigation measures to \nminimize dust, noise, stagnant water, and contamination from activities of temporary worker camps, \naccidents, and traffic disturbances. During operation of the oil-waste separation/treatment facility, \nenvironmental monitoring will focus on water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, oil \nand grease, and sulfides. Ten monitoring sites have been identified.     \n \n16.  CPA will prepare an annual report on implementing the monitoring and management plan \nand submit it to ADB and relevant government agencies. Similarly, RHD will prepare an annual \nreport on the implementation of the environmental management plan for its project component and \nsubmit it to ADB and other relevant institutions. \n  \n3.  Public Consultation \n \n17.   During the IEE study, in July 2004, consultations were held with the local communities. The \nconsultations focused on providing information related to the Project and seeking the community\u2019s \nconcerns. There were no public objections raised to the Project during the consultations.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n18.  The IEE shows that environmental impacts associated with the physical interventions under \nthe proposed Project are manageable and can be mitigated. Therefore, a full EIA to assess further \nimpacts is not required. However, continuous monitoring will be required and further support to CPA \nto formulate a comprehensive environmental management is necessary.  \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n19.  The Project will not cause significant environmental problems and the potential adverse \nimpacts are manageable. However, continued monitoring of implementation activities should be \ncarried out.

The economic analysis1 is based on container traffic forecasts under different scenarios. \nForecasts for \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d were made for the period from 2005 to 2020. \nSince the Project is expected to be implemented starting 2006, the analysis period of 15 years \nis considered from 2006 to 2020. Under the \u201cwith Project\u201d conditions, it is assumed that the \nmoderate growth scenario of the recent Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) forecast would be the \nlikely growth rate. This scenario assumes a compound annual growth rate of 6.4%. Under the \n\u201cwithout Project\u201d case, the average compound annual growth is assumed to be 2.6%. The \nresulting forecasts for both \u201cwithout Project\u201d and \u201cwith Project\u201d assumptions are summarized in \nAppendix 2 (para. 36 and 37).  \n2.  The following parameters and general assumptions were also used in the economic \nassessment: \n(i)  Numeraire. For all quantifiable project costs and benefits, the unit of account \nused is the domestic price level expressed in local currency (Taka). \n(ii)  Price level. The price level used for all project costs and benefits is constant \n2004 prices. \n(iii)  SERF and other factors. The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.05, and \nshadow wage rate factors for skilled/unskilled labor (SWRF) of 0.87/0.67 were \nused based on loan projects approved in 2002.2 The corresponding value for the \nshadow conversion factor (SCF) when the 13% value-added tax (VAT) rate is \napplied becomes 0.91, in comparison to the 0.83 average of the 2002 loan \nprojects. These values were found to be reasonable also due to the marginal \nsensitivity of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and net present value \n(NPV) in the present case to both SERF and SWRFs. A 20% increase in SERF \nto 1.26 lowered EIRR from 21.6% to 20.9%. Likewise, an increase in SWRF of \nskilled labor to 1.0 lowered EIRR to 21.4%. \n3.  Project Costs. The project resource statement (PRS) expressed in domestic prices in \nmillion takas is presented in Table A10.1. The PRS consists of the project costs (including initial \ncapital and annual fixed and variable operating costs) and benefits. Conversion of initial capital \ncosts expressed in nominal financial terms to economic costs is detailed in Table A10.2. Fixed \nand variable operating costs are estimated on the basis of annual accounting records and \ninformation provided by CPA.  \n4.  The shore gantry cranes will be installed at the same time as the container terminal \nmanagement system (CTMS). Although the cranes and the CTMS are separate investments, \nthe full benefits of the investment in cranes will not be derived without the computer system. \nTherefore, the cost of the cranes is not included in the total project cost, but as described below, \nthe benefits from the cranes are computed as reduction in ship turnaround times. Indeed, the \nreduction in turnaround times is assumed to be less if the Project is not implemented. \n                                                 \n1  Performed according to the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. 1997.

Project Benefits. With the CTMS, with better access and circulation roads, and with faster \ncustoms processing, two principal benefit streams are created. One accrues to ship owners due to \nthe anticipated reduction in vessel turnaround time (less waiting for loading and unloading). The \nother accrues to cargo owners (shippers and consignees) due to the lowering of capital costs tied \nup in inventories or idle cargo. The benefits fall into two categories: normal traffic and incremental \ntraffic. Supplementary Appendix I Table I-1 details the estimated benefits to ship owners. Despite \nthe gantry cranes, the vessel discharge/load rate without the Project is assumed to increase only to \n14 TEUs per hour because congestion is likely to worsen. With the Project, this rate is assumed to \nincrease from 15 TEUs per hour in 2006 when the trial operations are expected to commence, to 20 \nTEUs by 2013. The rate is expected to remain steady until 2020 due to the limitations in vessel size \n(maximum 1,200 TEUs) that can be expected to call at Chittagong. \n6.  The operating cost of those vessels is around $10,000 per day. Using this daily rate and the \nestimated reduction in port time at the above load/discharge rate, the shipowner benefits were \nestimated as detailed Supplementary Appendix I Table I-1. For normal traffic, the net benefit under \nwith-project assumptions is the difference between the total vessel costs in without-project and with-\nproject  conditions.  For  the  incremental  traffic,  it  is  assumed  to  be  one  half  of  the  savings, \nrepresenting the consumer surplus.  \n \n7.  The benefits accruing from lower average container dwell time is computed for two main \ncategories of cargo: garments and other (nontextile). In the case of garments, the average value \nper TEUs is assumed to be $80,000 according to CPA statistics. The average value of cargo for \nother containers is assumed to be $50,000. Assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 12%, a \nreduction of the average dwell time of 1 day represents a benefit of $26.30 for the opportunity cost \nof  working  capital  for  the  exporter.  Supplementary  Appendix  I  Table  I-2  shows  the  detailed \nestimates of benefits associated with the Project for the cargo owners. \n   \n8.  As shown in Table A10.1, the NPV of the Project at a discount rate of 12% is Tk3.6 billion \nand the EIRR is 21.6%.  \n \n9.  Risk and Sensitivity Analysis. Financial and economic risks of port projects stem largely \nfrom uncertain traffic and project costs. To estimate the economic risk induced by traffic variations, \nthe model @RISK was used assuming normally distributed traffic forecasts to derive vessel and \ncargo owner benefits. The total project cost was assumed to follow a triangular distribution, with the \nestimated cost as the mean with the lower bound and upper bound set at 90% and 110% of the \nmean. Accordingly, NPV can be expected to lie between $10.1 million and $79.2 million, while EIRR \nwill range from 16% to 23%. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the economic risk of the \nProject is zero. \n10.  CPA\u2019s traffic is largely captive since Mongla, the other seaport, cannot serve containerized \nexports and imports either due to lack of hinterland and infrastructure or geographic location. \nTherefore, traffic projections are unlikely to vary significantly. The switching value of 53% for \nincremental traffic as shown in Table A10.3 suggests that the likelihood of the Project becoming \ninfeasible is negligible. Costs, on the other hand, may vary from the estimates at appraisal, but the \nlikelihood of the variation exceeding 10% of estimated costs or benefits (which are based on \nexpected normal traffic) being 12% less (switching values shown in Table A10.3) is negligible.

Financial Analysis \n \n  1.  Financial Management, Organization, Accounting, and Audit \n \n11.  According to the provisions of the ordinance, CPA is a body incorporated as a perpetual \ngoing-concern. The fund of CPA is to be utilized to the charges in connection with CPA\u2019s functions \nunder  the  Ordinance  including  payment  of  development  expenses,  salaries  and  other \nremunerations to the port employees.  \n \n12.  While CPA has considerable independence under the ordinance in day-to-day operations, \nthe  overall  planning  and  financial  control  is  exercised  by  the  Government  through  budgetary \ncontrols or the Ordinance provisions which allow the Government\u2019s  intervention. Major capital \nexpenditures and their financing must be approved by the Government. Recruitment of employees \nis also required to be cleared by the Government. Tariffs in the ports are set and revised by CPA, \nsubject to the approval of the Government. \n \n13.  CPA  maintains  its  accounts  as  prescribed  by  the  Government.  In  some  respects,  its \naccounting is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For the analysis of \ntheir financial performances, some adjustments have been made on their financial statements to \nmake them in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (details of the adjustments \nmade are provided below). The financial statements are prepared annually and submitted to the \nGovernment. They are required to be audited by external auditors.  \n \n  2.  Financial Performance  \n \n14.  As  shown  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix  I  Table  I-3,  turnover  on  fixed  assets  has \nincreased and return on fixed assets has improved over the years because of dwindling size of net \nfixed  assets.  Owing  to  these  factors,  a  huge  amount  of  internally-generated  surplus  funds  is \naccumulated. The accumulated funds are deposited mostly in public sector banks and in part in \ncommercial banks under the direction of the Government. The funds created from CPA\u2019s income is \neffectively beyond the control of CPA since the Government\u2019s prior approval is required for major \ncapital  expenditures.  To  accelerate  replacement  of  aging  assets  and  to  upstream  the  capital \ninvestments needed for upgrading the ports\u2019 facilities, CPA needs to be given financial autonomy to \nhave direct control over internally-generated resources.  \n \n15.  The  past  financial  performance  of  CPA  is  summarized  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I      \nTable I-3. Operating revenues have grown by more than 10% a year on average. This high increase ", "    Appendix 10  55\nwas due to the same high growth in export and import in Bangladesh for the period. In comparison, \nthe growth of operating expenses was no higher than 6% a year on average since staff costs have \nbeen well under control. Consequently, the operating ratio has decreased from 63% in 1998 to 55% \nin 2003. Return on equity has remained at the level  of 12-16%, which can be considered a \nsatisfactory level.  \n \n16.  CPA\u2019s high profitability is attributed in part to high interest income from bank deposits. \nInterest income amounts to 50% of total operating income. CPA holds a large sum of accumulated \nsurplus earnings in the form of bank deposits. As of 30 June 2003, such bank deposits amount to \naround 60% of CPA\u2019s total assets. The deposits generate a fixed interest income that increases \nearnings, which is accumulated again. Because of this huge amount of surplus cash and low level \nof external debt, debt-service ratio is very high as shown in Supplementary Appendix I Table I-3. \nConsequently, financial ratios related debt-service, or capital structure are not so critical for analysis \nof financial performance. \n \n  3.  Financial Forecasts  \n17.  The financial forecast takes into account: (i) past performance; (ii) estimated capital and \noperating expenses; (iii) forecast growth in traffic; and (iv) projected level of fixed asset investment. \nThe financial projections are summarized in Supplementary Appendix I Table I-3. \n \n18.  Operating income is expected to grow about 10% a year on average. For the past 6 years, \nthe yearly normal fixed asset replacement rate has been around 6-7%. For the projection, the asset \nreplacement rate of 9% was assumed, considering CPA\u2019s capital investment plan. This increase in \nfixed assets resulted in increase in depreciation and increase in operating expense. Consequently, \noperating ratio will grow to 57% in the next 3 years from 2004 to 2006, and fall thereafter to 53%. \nFor the same reason, turnover on fixed assets will fall, and return on fixed assets will deteriorate \nduring  that  period.  But  they  will  bounce  back  thereafter.  Return  on  equity  will  remain  at  the \nreasonable level of 13%. Debt-service ratio will remain high despite the loan resulting from the \nProject because CPA has paid back almost all external debts by 2003.  \n \n19.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was estimated using a \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project \ncomparison. The major assumptions are: (i) FIRR reflects constant 2004 prices, (ii) the capital costs \ninclude  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  associated  with  the  proposed  investment  program \nincluding price contingency and interest charges during construction, (iii) projections for incremental \nport revenue streams were based on the forecast of incremental traffic with gantry cranes and \ncomputer systems, (iv) current tariffs are maintained, and (v) revenue and cost streams are over a \n15 year-period with a 10% residual value. The expenditure components of the analysis include the \ninitial capital cost, and recurrent annual operation and maintenance costs. \n20.  The weighted average cost of capital was calculated as 4% in line with the  minimum \nrequirement as set out in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment Projects Financed by ADB. The FIRR is calculated as 18%, which demonstrates the \nfinancial viability of the Project. \n  ", "56 Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY   \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe Chittagong port, being the main port of Bangladesh, provides an important link between international \nmaritime transportation, coastal shipping services, and national transport corridors (road and rail) to all \nparts of the country. It also has the potential to provide transit facilities to neighboring countries, namely \nBhutan, Nepal, and the eastern part of India. The port carries nearly 80% of the total seaborne exports and \nimports of the country. The development of the port has vast prospects of further increase in foreign trade, \nleading to economic growth with special emphasis on industrialization and development of services. This \nwill in turn generate new employment opportunities leading to a decrease in the national poverty rate. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nBangladesh is one of the poorest countries of the world, where poverty is widespread and particularly \nsevere in the rural and remote areas of the country. The national poverty rate is 49.8 % (the estimate is \nbased on upper poverty line method used by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) Household \nIncome and Expenditure Survey, 2000) and this is 53.1% and 36.6%, respectively, in the rural and urban \nareas of the country. Though agriculture is the major sector of country employing about 51% of the \ncountry\u2019s total labor force, it is still primitive in nature. Unless the absorptive capacity of the workforce is \nincreased in other sectors of the economy, the poverty situation will not improve. So, rapid development of \nsome sectors, especially transport and communication, trade, and business and industry is necessary to \ncope with the existing situation.  \n \nThe Project, located in Chittagong, is positioned to generate multisector impacts. The Government of \nBangladesh has recently declared Chittagong as the business capital of the country due to its contribution \nto exports and imports and other general business of the country. Chittagong is also the second largest \nindustrial city. The Government is further planning to declare the Dhaka-Chittagong highway as the new \n\u201ceconomic corridor\u201d in which case the port will be its lifeline. This will also give a big boost to agricultural \ngrowth, given the agro-ecological conditions of Chittagong. A rapid decline in the poverty ratio will require \na rapid growth in employment and livelihoods in the nonagriculture sector. With Sangu natural gas and \nother natural resources in Chittagong, the region has the potential for expanding its rural and small-scale \nindustries, as well as medium and large industries, to enrich the existing industrial base of the area. \n \nThe Chittagong Port Trade Facilitation Project will contribute to the economic growth required to reduce \npoverty through expansion of foreign trade, leading to optimum utilization of national transport corridors of \nthe country. The principal project benefits will accrue to the ship owners in terms of reduced port turnover \ntime, and cargo owners will benefit from reduced container dwell time. The Project will also improve \nefficiency and effectiveness of port management as well as expand the capacity of cargo handling. It will \nalso create new employment opportunities in the port as well as related sectors of the country. Proposed \ndevelopment of the port will improve the road and railway network of the country to promote regional \nintegration and a more equitable distribution of benefits. Improved management and expansion of different \nfacilities in the port in the long run will result in increased volume of the country\u2019s trade, and freight \ncharges, with  benefits  to  all sectors of  society.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  also  bring  benefits  to \nsurrounding communities, through increased port-related activities.  \n ", "    Appendix 11  57\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes     No \n \nAs part of the project social analysis and labor issues, in-depth consultation meetings were carried out \namong port officials, labor and trade union leaders, and other stakeholders of the Project. The focus of the \nconsultation meetings mainly included social appraisal, analysis of alternative options, and other relevant \nissues. During consultation meetings, the representatives of different port stakeholders took active interest \nand participated in discussions with regard to existing port scenarios relating to different labor issues \nincluding efficiency of labor/workers and productivity of the Chittagong port. Queries and apprehensions of \nthe participants were answered; the participants were also consulted to assess perceived problems and \nprospects in particular to the port issues. The consultation interviews were conducted using multiple \nqualitative research techniques such as group discussions, key informant consultation, and participatory \nobservations following a checklist of issues. A total of 16 consultation meetings were conducted. \n \nThe  consultation  meetings  were  organized  to  ensure  wider  input  from  both  the  primary  and \nsecstakeholders on various social dimensions and project impacts so as to develop a comprehensive \nperspective on the Project. Stakeholder consultations and community-based impact assessment were \ncarried out to (i) develop a socioeconomic profile of the port workers and laborers and/or community \nimpacts resulting from the Project; (ii) establish a dialogue with beneficiaries/stakeholders and provide an \nopportunity for them to understand the Project and its potential beneficial impacts on socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the country; and (iii) enable mitigation of the negative impacts of the Project where \nrequired. Community consultations and public participation processes will continue during implementation \nof the Project. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe proposed project works will not have any adverse impacts on women. The consultation process \nshowed that people (both men and women) were in favor of the Project. They know that the improvement \nof the port will improve the socioeconomic condition of the people as a whole. In fact, in the port few \nwomen work in the CPA office and the project will have no impact on them. But the executing agencies \n(EA) will address gender issues for women workers to be employed in construction-related activities and in \ncivil  works  construction  contracts.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  wage \ndifferentials between men and women, and that adequate health and sanitation facilities are available to \nwomen workers.

Despite  the  above,  the  development   None \ninterventions  will  affect  some  19  households,  6 \nbusinesses,  and  3  different  types  of  community \nestablishments. The total number of affected people \nis 112. All the affected establishments except the \npetrol pump are informal settlers. The owners of the \naffected structures will be compensated, based on a \nshort  resettlement  plan,  for  their  losses.  During \nsurvey and consultation meetings, they expressed \ntheir  willingness  to  relocate  themselves  with  all \nentitlements  paid.  The  short  resettlement  plan \ncontains details about the impact and entitlement \nmatrix  and  guidelines  reflecting  the  general \nprinciples of the Asian Development Bank policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement. \n    With the construction of internal and service roads   \n   Significant  of  the  port,  including  flyover  to  connect  the  port   Yes \nAffordability    access road, the port networks will be integrated   \n Not significant  with the national network Furthermore, the proposed    No \n  development of the port will improve the road and \n None  railway network of the country to promote regional \nintegration  and  more  equitable  distribution  of \nbenefits.

As a result, it will lead to overall \nsocioeconomic development of the country, creating \nadditional employment opportunities. \n    The Project may have some negative impacts on   \n   Significant  the employees of the port due to modernization of   Yes \nLabor    port activities. In this regard, the port\u2019s main labor   \n Not significant  supply organization (DWMB) has an existing plan    No  \n  for a skill development training program for unskilled \n None  workers to cope with the situation. In addition, in \norder  to  reduce  overstaffing,  POC  has  recently \nimplemented  a  \u201cgolden  handshake  program\u201d  to \nreduce the excess workforce, under which 1,042 \nold-aged and disabled workers were retired in May  \n2004.
