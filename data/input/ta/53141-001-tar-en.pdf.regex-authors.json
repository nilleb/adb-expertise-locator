INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) aims to deepen the knowledge and the institutional capacities of its developing \nmember countries (DMCs) for project design and readiness, procurement, monitoring of project \nimplementation, and evaluation of project outcomes. The TA will improve the portfolio quality \nacross regional departments and mitigate causes of project implementation delays. This entails \n(i) enhancing project design capacity; (ii) strengthening procurement planning and bid evaluation, \ncontract management, and project management capacity; (iii) taking stock of and developing \nstudies on best practices needed for project implementation and portfolio management, which \ncan  be  shared  and  replicated  across  the  DMCs;  and  (iv)  providing  capacity  development \nprograms to the executing and implementing agencies primarily through training, workshops, and \nclinics, to increase their understanding and improve the application of processes, policies, and \nguidelines of the new procurement framework (NPF) approved in 2017.1 The overarching goal is \nto strengthen DMCs\u2019 ability to successfully design and implement ADB-financed projects. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2019 Technical Assistance Special Fund corporate priority list \nfor the Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department (PPFD) and builds on the \nfollowing TA projects: (i) Enhancing Capacity for Effective Project Implementation;2 (ii) Enhancing \nProcurement Performance of Developing Member Countries in ADB Projects;3 and (iii) Supporting \nDeveloping  Member  Countries  in  Implementing  ADB\u2019s  Second-Generation  Procurement \nReforms.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 20305 emphasizes the need to strengthen governance and institutional \ncapacity to enable executing and implementing agencies to effectively plan, design, finance, \nprocure, and implement ADB projects. ADB continues to enforce rigorous environmental and \nsocial safeguards, adhere to standards for efficient procurement and financial management, as \nwell as implement anticorruption measures in all ADB projects and programs. As a major \ndevelopment knowledge partner, ADB assists DMCs in undertaking critical reforms to build \ncountry  systems  by  applying  advanced  technology,  reducing  life-cycle  costs,  assuring  the \nfinancial viability of investments, and maintaining infrastructure assets. It also contributes to \nmaintaining and raising standards of project implementation in the international development \ncommunity. In addition to supporting capacity building and policy dialogue within and across \nDMCs, ADB uses TA resources to pilot-test innovative approaches and solutions in specific areas \nand sectors with a view to replicating successful outcomes. By strengthening local capacity in \nthese areas, DMCs will improve their governance and help make ADB investments sustainable. \n \n4.  Despite the high levels of sovereign investment, there is room to improve the efficiency \nand  speed  of  project  implementation  in  ADB  DMCs.  The  major  causes  of  poor  project \nperformance are (i) weak project design; (ii) detailed engineering designs prepared after project \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2017.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "2 \napproval; (iii) weak counterpart capacity for procurement and project management, both in the \nnumber of staff and their skill levels, particularly in the key areas of procurement planning, bid \npreparation  and  evaluation,  consultant  recruitment,  financial  management,  and  contract \nmanagement;  (iv)  lengthy  and  often  complex  implementation  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; and (v) limited access and exposure to international best practices on project \nimplementation.  \n \n5.  Lessons from ongoing TA projects also suggest that harmonizing training and capacity \nbuilding with parallel efforts by regional departments is imperative to effectively narrow the DMCs\u2019 \ncapacity gaps. Client feedback on programs carried out under prior TA suggests that the level of \nawareness of ADB\u2019s operational procedures has increased among DMCs, but some knowledge \nand skills gaps remain. PPFD fulfills its role as a regional knowledge connector and facilitator by \nsharing country cases and lessons, and tailoring customized in-depth technical sessions for \nDMCs. To meet the needs of executing and implementing agencies, the efforts of PPFD and \nregional departments will be more strategically coordinated to design and deliver more cohesive \ncapacity-building programs. In addition, PPFD will make programs sustainable by using financial \nresources efficiently and developing effective and quality program designs. Program principles \nand  tools  will  be  embedded  in  practice  and  institutionalized  to  ensure  replicability  and \nsustainability. \n \n6.  Support on the use of the NPF is critical in the absence of familiarity with its application. \nThe underlying causes of project implementation delays are often attributed to slow procurement \nand weak implementation capacity, which points to limited skills and experience in handling \nprocurement processes and procedures, as well as complex contracts. Often, the executing and \nimplementing agencies do not have the capacity to prepare quality bid documents and reports \nthat meet ADB\u2019s standards, which results in resubmissions and delays to the procurement cycle. \nNew features of the NPF\u2014such as strategic procurement planning, contract management, and \nvalue for money\u2014need to be better understood. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen the \nNPF implementation capacities of DMCs and provide timely support for projects covered under \nthe new rules. The TA will support the implementation of the NPF. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Stronger institutional capacity for country \ndevelopment  among  DMCs.  It  is  expected  to  have  the  following  outcome:  project  design, \nprocurement, and implementation performance in participating DMCs improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Project design, procurement, and implementation capacity strengthened. \nThe TA will support a range of capacity-building programs such as seminars, workshops, and \ntraining  covering  project  design,  project  readiness,  procurement,  safeguards,  financial \nmanagement, and portfolio monitoring. While the TA allows flexibility in supporting evolving client \nneeds, a larger share of resources will be allocated to DMCs that consistently demonstrate weak \ncapacity  for  implementing  ADB-financed  projects.  In  close  collaboration  with  regional \ndepartments and resident missions, the TA will also address DMC\u2019s specific needs by offering \ncustomized programs. The progress of the output will be measured through the participants\u2019 \nfeedback on the knowledge acquired and the relevance to their tasks. Key activities linked to the \noutputs involve  \n ", "3 \n(i)  delivering a wide range of regional capacity-building programs to better meet the \nprocurement, financial management, and design and implementation challenges \nthat DMCs face across the project cycle, such as project readiness, gender and \nsafeguard requirements, and project evaluation; and  \n(ii)  organizing in-country capacity development programs in response to demands \nfrom executing and implementing agencies, such as training on the function and \nactivities of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC).  \n \n9.  Output 2: DMCs\u2019 capacity to implement projects under the NPF enhanced. The TA \nwill  support  outreach  programs  to  deepen  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  key  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  with  regard  to  ADB\u2019s  NPF.  Using  feedback  captured  through \nquestionnaires and surveys, the programs will be designed to boost the problem-solving skills of \nparticipants  to  help  them  implement  project  operations  proactively.  The  TA  team  will  also \ndetermine the right mix and number of participants, with at least two to three representatives from \nthe key executing and implementing agencies that are administering ADB-financed projects, in \nclose consultation with regional departments. The technical assistance incorporates some gender \nelements in that it encourages women\u2019s attendance (at least 30% of program participants to be \nwomen). Key activities linked to the output involve  \n(i)  disseminating NPF communication materials quarterly;  \n(ii)  delivering at least one 3-day outreach session and at least one workshop on \nstrategic procurement planning, contract management, and value for money in \neach participating DMC; and  \n(iii)  conducting hands-on training on how to apply the NPF to current and future \ntransactions under the responsibility of the executing and implementing agencies. \n \n10.  Output 3: Knowledge products on better project preparation and implementation \nproduced. In its capacity as a regional knowledge partner, the TA team will support the production \nof knowledge products to improve national and regional expertise on key project design and \nimplementation aspects of the project cycle. Virtual platforms will also be used to provide other \nlearning options. The output will thus support institutional knowledge retention through learner-\ncentric and flexible access to cases or references anytime and anywhere. The program topic will \nbe selected carefully and in close consultation with regional departments to improve DMCs\u2019 \ntransaction practices. Knowledge products and solutions will be provided by  \n(i)  designing e-learning modules;  \n(ii)  hosting knowledge-sharing sessions and events;  \n(iii)  disseminating knowledge and lessons learned; \n(iv)  publishing case studies; and  \n(v)  organizing regional study tours for executing and implementing agencies to learn \nfrom international best practice. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA budget is estimated at $2,250,000, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \n   \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA through PPFD. The department\u2019s Portfolio Management \nDivision, supported by the Procurement Divisions 1 and 2, will be responsible for overall TA \ncoordination in close collaboration with the Office of the Director General of PPFD and the \nFinancial Management Division. Regional departments will be consulted prior to engaging with \nDMC counterparts. PPFD will maintain close coordination with regional departments during the \nimplementation of the TA, including sector and thematic groups as necessary, to respond to \nemerging client needs.  \n \n13.

Consulting services. ADB will engage individual international and national consultants \nfor a total of 34 person-months of inputs.6 The consultants will need to have expertise in the \ndesign and delivery of procurement-related capacity-building programs, e-learning modules, and \nother capacity-building elements; effective communications of and outreach on project outputs; \nand production of knowledge materials. \n \n15.  Knowledge partnerships. ADB will pursue knowledge partnerships with other multilateral \ndevelopment banks and training institutions in the course of implementing the TA. \n \n16.  Procurement. Procurement of goods and consulting and non-consulting services will \nfollow the ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nits associated staff instructions. \n \n17.  Communication strategy and plan. The TA will support increase DMCs awareness of \ncritical  aspect  of  project  design  and  implementation  for  quality  project  delivery.  In  close \nconsultation with Department of Communications, communication strategy and plan will be \ndeveloped for clear messaging for awareness raising efforts. To do so the TA team will use ADB\u2019s \nwebsites such as ADB.org, Asian Development Blogs, Development Asia and its ADB Knowledge \nEvents subpage, and ADB eLearn and social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, \nLinkedIn, and other applications and virtual platforms to (i) preserve and share knowledge, (ii) \nprovide inputs and create new contents, (iii) increase PPFD brand awareness, and (iv) obtain new \nfindings and introduce innovation. The TA will also produce knowledge products of selected \nprograms and other relevant materials to operations and share them with DMCs. Monitoring and \nfollow up activities will also be planned. TA outputs will comply with ADB\u2019s branding guidelines, \nincluding video production guideline, in developing knowledge products. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,250,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Project Design, Procurement, and Implementation in Asia and the Pacific, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                 \n6 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact(s) the TA is Aligned with \nStronger institutional capacity for country development among DMCs  (Strategy 2030)a \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome      Political \ninstability in \nProject design,  By 2024:   \nthe targeted \nprocurement, \na.
