INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2001 Country Strategy and Program Formulation Mission, the Government of \nthe Maldives requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA) for Revenue Diversification1 and the TA was incorporated in the Country Strategy and \nProgram  for  2002-2004.  This  TA  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  growth  and  poverty \nreduction strategy with a strong macroeconomic framework and good governance. The Fact-\nFinding Mission2 from ADB visited the Maldives from 17 to 20 February 2002. The Mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the justification and priority for the TA, its \nobjectives and scope, and implementation details including the terms of reference for the TA \nconsultants. The project framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The fiscal revenue base of the Maldives is limited primarily to income from tourism, \nimport duties, and dividends from public enterprises. According to the latest figures available for \n2000, tourism taxes and resort lease rents comprised 29.8%, import duties accounted for 28.2% \nand receipts from public enterprises for 18% of total Government revenue.3 Traditional direct \ntaxes on income and profits (viz., personal and corporate income taxes), on domestic goods \nand services (viz., sales taxes or value-added tax), and on wealth (viz., capital gains or asset \ntransfer taxes) are neither well defined nor widely implemented.  \n \n3.  However,  skewed  dependence  of  the  economy  on  tourism  has  rendered  it  highly \nvulnerable to external shocks, and adverse developments in international demand have had a \ndebilitating  effect  on  the  fiscal  position  of  the  Government.  In  addition,  the  nascent \ndevelopments in international trade will have to be addressed. Foremost are the concerns that \nthe World Trade Organization valuation rule on imports based on transaction value, to be \nintroduced in the second half of 2002, may constrain import duty revenue, and about the extent \nto which the South Asia Free Trade Area regional cooperation agreement, currently under \nconsideration, will reduce import tariffs.  Moreover, the planned divestiture and corporatization \nof public enterprises will further limit the nontax revenue of the Government. In the context of \nthese considerations, reforming the revenue structure has been a major policy objective of the \nGovernment. \n \n4.  The  Government  was  assisted  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  in  its \npreliminary considerations of revenue diversification. IMF conducted a feasibility study in 19944 \nand provided various recommendations for reform of the revenue structure to the Government. \nActing on these recommendations, the Department of Inland Revenue (DIR) was established \nunder the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) in December 1996.5 The objective of DIR \nwas  to  centralize  tax  and  nontax  revenue  administration.  With  a  view  to  broadening  and \nrationalizing the revenue base, DIR took over the assessment and collection of 25 existing \ntaxes, fees, and other charges since its advent.  In addition, a Revenue Board (the Board) was \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 March 2002. \n2  The Mission comprised J. Tsunoda, Mission Leader/ Financial Markets Specialist, SAGF.  \n3  The balance came from various minor sources, such as stamp duty revenues, administrative fees and charges, \nroyalties and interest income. \n4  Toward Reform of the Revenue Structure, IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, 1994. The Mission discussed the \nobjectives and scope of the TA with IMF representatives and received supportive comments on the TA. \n5  Assisted by IMF's Preparatory Work for Creating Inland Revenue Department and for Enacting Laws on Taxation \nof Business Profits, Taxation of Property Rental Value, and Measures for Implementation, 1995. A Strategy to \nEstablish an Inland Revenue Department, IMF Fiscal Affairs Department Report, 1997. Department of Inland \nRevenue-Implementation Report, Part I and Part II, 1997. ", "2   \nestablished under MOFT in 1997. Comprising six high-level government officials and two sector \nrepresentatives, the Board was mandated to formulate revenue policies. Since 1997, the Board \nhas been mandated to introduce the business profit tax (BPT) and the property rentals value tax \n(PRVT), in line with the 1994 IMF recommendations.  \n \n5.  The BPT is to be charged on the net profits of any business establishment based on \nself-assessment determined through commercial accounts or on a presumptive basis. The BPT \naims for equity and efficiency and for broadening the revenue base. The PRVT is a tax to be \nlevied on monthly gross rental income. The PRVT aims for income redistribution from upper \nincome households that own rental property, especially in Male, where the shortage of habitable \nrooms  and  space  has  been  a  serious  constraint.  A  preliminary  study6 on  revenue  impact \nindicates that the BPT is expected to increase tax revenue by Rf125 million, whereas the PRVT \nis expected to yield an additional Rf40 million, which are 5.3% and 1.7% of the Government's \ntotal revenue in year 2000.    \n \n6.  IMF and the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC) also assisted in \ndrafting legislation on the two new taxes, namely the BPT bill and the PRVT bill developing the \ntax administration bill and regulations7 and preparing a tax administration manual.8 However, \nthese tax bills are yet to be enacted, and the necessary implementation planning for operational \nand administrative capacity building is needed at DIR. Given ADB's role as the lead multilateral \naid agency in this sector in the Maldives, the Government has requested TA support. This TA is \nin line with the key thrusts of ADB\u2019s country strategy for Maldives, one of which is to build the \ncapacity of government institutions for better public sector management. \n \n7.  In particular, the TA will assist the Government in preparing an implementation plan for \nintroducing the BPT and PRVT; providing hands-on institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding at DIR; and preparing for submission of the BPT bill, PRVT bill, tax administration bill \nand regulations to the People\u2019s Majlis.9 The TA proposal is in line with IMF recommendations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  main  objectives  of  this  TA  are  to  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  devising  an \nimplementation plan for the BPT and the PRVT, and  (ii) supporting the enactment of relevant \nlegislation and regulations. The goal is to broaden the revenue base of the Government to \nenable faster growth through more prudent fiscal and macroeconomic management based on a \nwider revenue base. \n \n9.  The TA will support DIR and MOFT by (i) conducting a study on how operational and \nadministrative capacity could be enhanced for the effective management of the BPT and the \nPRVT; (ii) submitting the BPT bill, the PRVT bill, the tax administration bill, and regulations to \nthe People\u2019s Majlis for consideration and enactment; and (iii) conducting a thorough assessment \nof the computerized tax management database and exploring synergies with the ADB-assisted \n                                                 \n6  Wadhwa, S.R., CFTC\u2019s Tax Advisor, 1997.

Methodology and Key Activities \n10.     After reviewing materials and manuals prepared by other aid agencies, and assessing \nthe  existing  human  resources  capacity  and  requirements  of  DIR,  the  consultant  team  will \nconduct requirement studies on tax administration and database management to prepare an \nimplementation schedule and an overall plan for introducing the BPT incorporating the status of \nthe existing capacity level of DIR and necessary capacity-building measures to be introduced. \nThe consultant team will also provide skill transfer and capacity building through on the job \ntraining and internal seminars at DIR. At the same time, the consultant team will assist DIR in \npreparing draft legislation for the BPT, the PRVT, the tax administration bill, and regulations and \nin passing the legislation. \n \n11.  Strong  dedication  by  MOFT  in  introducing  the  BPT  and  the  PRVT;  and  DIR  staff \ninvolvement in preparing the studies, the implementation plan, and draft legislation, especially in \nthe Dhivehi language are considered critical for successful implementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $415,000 equivalent, comprising $328,000 in \nforeign exchange and $87,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 2). ADB will finance \nthe  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $22,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB \nfinancing will be provided on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund of the Government of \nJapan. The Government of the Maldives will finance the remaining $65,000 equivalent of project \ncost in local currency. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MOFT will be the executing agency for the TA. MOFT will provide full-time counterpart \nstaff to facilitate timely and full access of the consultant team to relevant information. A steering \ncommittee,  formed  by  MOFT,  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  TA.  The  steering \ncommittee will be staffed by the Director of DIR, a representative each from the Audit Office and \nthe Maldives Customs Service, as well as other staff from MOFT as necessary.  The steering \ncommittee will be responsible for overall TA implementation, especially during the translation of \nthe draft legislation and regulations of the BPT and PRVT from English to Dhivehi in close \ncoordination with the Law Commission.  \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out with the assistance of international and domestic consultants. \nInternational consultants will be engaged for a total of 11 person-months, while a domestic \nconsultant will be engaged for 2 person-months. Selection and engagement of consultants \nthrough a consultancy firm will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultant \nteam will comprise a tax administration specialist/team leader (international, 5 person-months), \na tax legal specialist (international, 3 person-months), a tax database management specialist \n(international, 3 person-months), and a legal specialist (domestic, 2 person-months).  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2001.

The tax administration specialist will develop a time-bound implementation schedule \nand an overall requirement plan for the BPT and the PRVT in consultation with the Government, \nas well as recommending tax rates with  simulation figures and reviewing the administrative \nmanual and probable impact of the two new taxes. The tax administration specialist will also \nreview  and  assess  the  organizational  structure  for  tax  administration;  assist  the  tax  legal \nspecialist  in  redrafting  existing  legislation  and  regulations;  and  design  public  awareness \nprograms and in-house training, workshops and seminars on the new tax administration. The \ntax legal specialist will review the existing drafts of the BPT and the PRVT and will coordinate \nwith the Law Commission in submitting draft legislation to the People\u2019s Majlis for consideration. \nThe domestic legal specialist, who will be primarily responsible for translating all bills into \nDhivehi, will assist them. The tax database management specialist will explore how database \nmanagement  at  DIR  can  be  enhanced,  identify  the  specification  for  database  and  tax \nadministration software required for the new management system, and assess how the interface \nwith the existing collection system under the Maldives Customs Service can be achieved in \nconjunction with the ADB-assisted Information Technology Development Project. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants is provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The TA is expected to commence in November 2002 and to be completed by May 2003. \nThe consultants will prepare an inception report within 15 days, and an interim report within \n2 months from the start of consulting services. The consultants will submit the draft final report \n2 weeks before the end of the assignment. The recommendations of the report will be discussed \nin  a  tripartite  meeting  among  the  consultant  team,  the  steering  committee,  and  ADB \nrepresentatives.  The  consultant  team  will  submit  hard  and  soft  copies  of  the  reports  to  \nExecuting Agency and the ADB. An outline for the final report is attached as Appendix 4. \n \nIV.
