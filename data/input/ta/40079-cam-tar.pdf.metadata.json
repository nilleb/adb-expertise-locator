INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Cambodia (the Government) requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help strengthen the institutional, policy making, and \nregulatory capacity of the Cambodian National Petroleum Authority (CNPA) so that the authority \ncan deal with emerging issues in the oil and gas sector. The ADB TA Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited  Cambodia  from  7\u201310  June  2006  and  had  discussions  with  various  ministries  and \nstakeholders about the TA. The mission reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.1 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  International oil companies started exploration for oil and gas in the late 1950s and \ncontinued until the outbreak of conflict in 1970. They found little in the way of significant \nreserves and suspended activities during the conflict period (1975\u20131991). Exploration activities \nresumed in 1991, with Cambodia identifying and bidding out onshore and offshore exploration \nblocks to international oil companies. In 2005, ChevronTexaco (Chevron) announced that it had \nfound oil in block A of its offshore concession. This oil find is estimated on a preliminary basis at \naround 400\u2013700 million barrels of oil.2 Chevron plans further drilling of appraisal wells from \nSeptember 2006 to March 2007 to establish the reservoir volumes and confirm the reserves. \nNatural gas deposits, estimated at 3\u20135 trillion cubic feet, are also reported, both as associated \ngas and gas pockets. Again, these figures will have to be confirmed following further drilling of \nappraisal  wells  and  analysis  of  production  tests.  Chevron  has  stated  that  it  intends  to \ncommence production from block A in 2010. Blocks B, C, and D are also under exploration, \nwhile offshore blocks E and F and onshore blocks 11, 12, 13, and 26 are currently being offered \nfor tender. Thus there seems to be considerable potential for finding oil and gas resources \nwithin Cambodia\u2019s territory.   \n \n3.  Estimates indicate that the Government might reasonably receive $500 million to $1 \nbillion a year from oil and gas production. This will largely depend on the oil and gas flows and \non the agreed production rates. Nevertheless, compared with total Government revenues of \nabout $665 million in 2005, this revenue is significant and does not include the possible income \nfrom other adjoining offshore blocks currently under exploration. This possible huge increase in \nrevenues has generated both hope and concerns in the Government and in the international \ncommunity. If well managed, the resources could greatly improve the delivery of much needed \nbasic  health,  education,  and  water  supply  services,  in  addition  to  improving  the  country\u2019s \ninfrastructure bottlenecks. The Government needs suitable policies and mechanisms for optimal \ngeneration of revenue from this resource, and for the equitable distribution of the resulting \neconomic benefits. \n \n4.  Therefore Cambodia needs to put appropriate policies and strategic plans in place to \ndirect the development of the sector. The CNPA, which was established by royal decree in 1998, \nreports to the Council of Ministers and oversees all segments of the petroleum sector. Despite \nits limited capacity, the CNPA has achieved a good deal since its establishment. It has been \nable to successfully negotiate a production sharing agreement with Chevron and has made \nfurther revisions to the product sharing agreement with regard to other blocks awarded. In \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 December 2006.  \n2  These figures are indicative, as the CNPA and Chevron have not provided details. Not all reserves will be \neconomically recoverable and are subject to appraisal and testing. These and the revenue calculations should \ntherefore be taken as orders of magnitude. \n ", "2   \nrecognizing its limitations and capacity, the CNPA is taking steps to improve the legal and \nregulatory environment for the oil and gas sector. It is developing a revised organizational \nstructure with clear descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of departments and sections \nand envisages that this will be approved by royal decree by early 2007. As a result of Chevron\u2019s \ndiscovery  in  block  A,  the  CNPA  faces  an  extremely  steep  learning  curve  in  relation  to \ninspections; data management; production and cost accounting and auditing; approval of field \ndevelopment plans, environmental management plans, and production permits; and qualification \nand selection of subcontractors.  \n \n5.  Developing the oil and gas sector in Cambodia is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand program (2005\u20132009)3 for Cambodia, which focuses on poverty reduction and continued \noperations  to  support  the  development  of  infrastructure  and  the  promotion  of  an  enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation.  \n \n6.  In response to the Government\u2019s request for policy advice and technical support to \ndevelop the sector, a joint ADB and World Bank mission visited Cambodia in May 2006. The \nmission held various meetings with relevant Government agencies and development partners to \ndiscuss emerging issues in the oil and gas sector and the scope for policy advice and technical \nsupport from external funding agencies. The mission undertook (i) continued dialogue with \nrelevant Government authorities on issues in the oil and gas sector; (ii) stock taking of current \nand planned activities in the sector; (iii) discussions with relevant authorities on the need for a \npetroleum policy framework (inclusive of upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas) \nand a road map for developing the sector; and (iv) discussions with development partners on \ntheir planned technical support activities and programs covering policy, institutional, legal and \nregulatory, financial, technical, and commercial aspects of the oil and gas sector. \n \n7.  A donor working group on oil and gas was established in January 2006. This working \ngroup comprises ADB, Australian Aid for International Development, the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the Norwegian Agency for Development \nCooperation, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. ADB is the \nchair of this working group. Discussions between donors and the Government led to a general \nunderstanding of the areas in which the development partners will provide assistance. The \nUnited Nations Development Programme, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank \nwill provide assistance with (i) developing cross-sector policies and safeguards; (ii) devising \npetroleum fund options; (iii) drafting tax law amendments for the oil and gas sector; (iv) training \nstaff in the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy; \nand (v) providing capacity building in the fields of public financial management, accountability, \nand  revenue  management.  Australian  Aid  for  International  Development,  through  the \nCambodia-Australia Technical Assistance Facility, is helping the CNPA prepare strategic road \nmaps for the development of upstream segments in the offshore, onshore, and overlapping \nclaims  areas  and  draft  a  petroleum  law.  Under  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development \nCooperation program, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate has entered into an agreement with \nthe CNPA to assist with the development of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for \nthe sector under a 2-year assistance package. ADB will focus on strengthening the CNPA's \ncapacity to professionally manage and develop oil field operations in order to optimize resource \nutilization. ADB will also strengthen the CNPA\u2019s capacity to undertake environmental monitoring \nof oil and gas exploration and production activities.      \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Cambodia. Manila \n ", "  3\n8.  An earlier ADB TA4 for the oil and gas sector in Cambodia addressed the development \nof methodologies for energy surveys, data collection, economic evaluation of energy projects,  \nand energy planning techniques; prepared a framework for a mineral and hydrocarbon database; \nand drafted a petroleum law that addressed upstream operations. Before 1997, the Ministry of \nIndustry,  Mines,  and  Energy  had  managed  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  but  in  1998,  the  new \nGovernment instituted organizational changes that resulted in the establishment of the CNPA. In \nline with the royal decree on the formation of the CNPA, its upstream duties include overseeing \nexploration activities; managing data on petroleum resources; defining blocks for exploration; \nmanaging  bidding  for  blocks;  negotiating  conditions  for  exploration  and  production;  and \ncoordinating  legal,  economic,  and  technical  standards  for  the  sector.  With  Chevron\u2019s \nannouncement of its oil discovery in its exploration wells in 2005 and with other blocks under \ndevelopment,  the  CNPA  has  to  fast-track  its  capacity  development  and  expand  its \nresponsibilities beyond the exploration stage to discovery, production, and supply of oil and gas. \n \n9.  In  recognition  of  the  sector\u2019s  importance  to  Cambodia\u2019s  future  development,  the \nGovernment is committed to putting in place a  framework that would attract international oil \ncompanies  and  spur  investments  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector  (upstream,  midstream,  and \ndownstream). The Government\u2019s program is intended to create a more robust institutional and \nadministrative  governance  structure  and  the  technical  capacity  to  adequately  facilitate \ninvestment in and oversight of the sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The main impact of the TA will be optimum exploitation of oil and gas resources in \nCambodia through efficient management of field development and the production stages of \npetroleum operations. This will be achieved by strengthening the institutional, policy making, \nand regulatory capacity of the CNPA and preparing plans for developing essential physical \ninfrastructure. The TA will provide clarity on the operational framework in the sector, which will \nmaximize the value of petroleum resources, contribute to the development of public-private \npartnerships, and improve access to energy resources in the region.  \n \n11.  The TA will address the institutional strengthening and capacity building of the CNPA in \nthe areas of (i) economic modeling; (ii)  production and petroleum cost accounting and auditing; \n(iii) hydrocarbon data management for both contract management and promotion of additional \nexploration;  (iv)  evaluation  of  development  plans  and  applications  for  production  permits \naccording to best industry practices, such as maximum economic recovery, adequate safety \nplanning,    protection  of  the  environment,  and  compliance  with  specific  obligations  for \nemployment of Cambodian goods and services; (v) qualification and selection of foreign and \nnational service contractors through transparent and competitive procurement procedures; and \n(vi)  environmental  management  and  inspection  during  oil  and  gas  field  exploration  and \nexploitation. The TA will also plan the development of physical infrastructure required for the \npetroleum industry, including a domestic supply base.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Strengthening the Institutional and Legal \nFramework for the Energy and Mineral Sectors. Manila (TA 2241-CAM, approved in 1996). \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA consultants will review the petroleum agreements for both offshore blocks and \nonshore blocks, with particular emphasis on block A and the 1991 petroleum regulations, as \nwell as the upstream road maps prepared by the Cambodia-Australia Technical Assistance \nFacility consultants. As exploration activities expand in Cambodia, an increasing volume of \ninformation will be produced, including seismic data, geographic information system data, maps, \ngravity and magnetic data, and well logs. All such information obtained by different exploration \ncompanies has to be shared with and submitted to the CNPA. An efficient database is required \nto manage and use this information to optimize oil field operations. Therefore a hydrocarbon \ndatabase needs to be developed and CNPA staff need to be trained in its effective use to store \nand manage the data. This will include developing a format for hydrocarbon data submission \nthat  all  petroleum  operators  will  follow.  The  hydrocarbon  database  will  require  dedicated \nhardware (including a geophysical client and server workstation, a geological workstation, a \ntape drive, external hard disk drives, computer system interface, a plotter, a network switch, and \naccessories),  proprietary  and  specialized  software  (including  a  data  manager  and  two-\ndimensional  and/or  three-dimensional  seismic  interpretation  programs),  installation,  and \ntraining. The CNPA and the consultants will identify a suitable package for the hydrocarbon \ndatabase in accordance with industry best practices. \n \n13.  Discussions will be held with the CNPA to develop and implement training programs in \nrelation  to  inspections,  economic  modeling,  petroleum  accounting  and  auditing,  data \nmanagement,  petroleum  service  contracts,  development  plans,  production  sharing  contract \nmanagement,  and  inspection  and  management  of  environmental  practices  by  petroleum \nagreement operators for CNPA staff and for other relevant officials. The CNPA\u2019s information \ntechnology capability will be assessed in terms of capability for economic analysis, accounting, \nand data management. Computer systems and operating software will be acquired to develop \nthe CNPA\u2019s technical capacity in these areas. \n \n14.  Cambodia has a framework for environmental impact assessment and for the approval \nof  environmental  management  plans.  This  existing  framework  will  be  complemented  by \nstrengthening the CNPA\u2019s capacity to inspect and monitor the implementation of environmental \nmanagement plans in petroleum operations. Establishing consistent environmental standards \nfor contractors is also required. The TA will develop guidelines and checklists for preparing \nenvironmental management plans based on the guidelines used by institutions such as the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, the Association for Petroleum and Explosives Administration, the \nUS Environmental Protection Agency, and by the Thai authorities. A mechanism for addressing \nenvironmental issues related to sensitive areas, like sites of historic and cultural importance, will \nbe developed in consultation with the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, the \nMinistry of Defense, and the Apsara Authority. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,090,000. The Government has requested that \nADB provide $1,000,000 to cover most of the TA cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis. \nThe TA will be financed by the Japan Special Fund. The Government will finance $90,000 in \nkind by providing counterpart staff, office space and facilities, technical studies, and support \nservices.  The  cost-sharing  ceiling  for  this  TA  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  new  policy  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s share is below the overall country level of 15% for TAs. Detailed cost estimates \nand a financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The CNPA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will require assistance of \nabout 22 person\u2013months of international and about 8 person-months of national consulting \nservices. ADB will engage an international consulting firm in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The international consulting \nfirm will be responsible for making appropriate arrangements for national consultants and will be \nresponsible  to  ADB  for  the  total  scope  of  the  TA.  Simplified  technical  proposals  will  be \nrequested and evaluated using the quality- and cost-based selection method. The TA will be \nimplemented over a period of 12 months commencing in April 2007 and ending in March 2008. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The hydrocarbon database will include proprietary software and requires training of \nCNPA staff to operate the data management system. The hydrocarbon data management \nsystem will require compatible hardware. The data management system will be custom made \nbased on a joint needs assessment by the CNPA and the consultants and will follow best \nindustry practices for the oil and gas sector in terms of functions and price. ADB will approve \nprocurement of the hydrocarbon database management system based on the recommendation \nof the CNPA. Given the limited number of suppliers of the required software and the integrated \ndata management package identified, limited international bidding will be used. All equipment \nwill be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April \n2006, as amended from time to time) and retained by the CNPA on completion of the TA. \n \nIV.
