THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Financial Sector Development and Inclusion Program; and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the \nFinancial Sector Development and Inclusion Program. \n \n2.  The program supports the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s efforts to develop and improve the \ninclusiveness of the finance sector and represents a medium- to long-term partnership between \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the government.  The government\u2019s  program  will:  \n(i) ensure greater financial stability; (ii) deepen the capital markets; and (iii) promote financial \ninclusion with a focus on expanding microfinance and financial technology. The program is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for delivery in 2018.1 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.   The development problem. Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth is among the highest in the \nregion \u2013 gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.8% in 2017. While the overall macroeconomic \noutlook is positive, Viet Nam remains vulnerable to several risks due to the long-standing \nstructural  weaknesses  in  the  economy,  including  inefficient  investment  related  to  the  low \nproductivity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the undercapitalized and inefficient banking \nsector.2 Financial buffers are thin and the macroeconomic frameworks are inflexible, making it \nharder to manage possible shocks, including disruptions in the global supply chains.3 As Viet Nam \nbecomes increasingly integrated into the global economy, with trade accounting for two times its \nGDP, Viet Nam must address these impediments to remain competitive and meet the national \ngrowth targets of 6.5%\u20137.0% in its Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS), 2011\u20132020.4 \nInitiatives to improve the investment climate and strengthen the finance sector for more efficient \nand inclusive financial intermediation will be required.  \n \n4.  Against this backdrop, the government is concerned with the prospect of rising income \ninequality. While 50 million people have been lifted out of poverty since 1993, pockets of poverty \nremain, especially in Northern midlands and mountainous areas and Central Highlands where \nethnic minorities live. While income inequality is less severe compared to other neighboring \ncountries, it has increased notably within a short period of time, with the official Gini coefficient \nrising from 0.42 in 2002 to 0.43 in 2014. In rural areas, income inequality has increased much \nfaster, with the Gini coefficient rising from 0.36 in 2002 to 0.40 in 2014.5 Moreover, an ADB study \nshows that Viet Nam\u2019s recent economic growth has exhibited pro-rich gains, with returns to \nagriculture and manufacturing increasing only for the wealthiest 10%\u201320% of the population.6  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

No.681. Manila. \n ", "2 \n5.  To promote sustainable economic growth, reduce poverty, and tackle rising income \ninequality, the government has been implementing several strategies to provide the poor with \ngreater access to basic social services such as education, health care, and public housing. \nInvestments  in  basic  infrastructure  including  transportation,  electricity,  and  water  are  also \nprioritized to improve the livelihood and connectivity of people living in rural areas. To implement \nthese strategies, the government has targeted social investment spending between 32%\u201334% of \nGDP over the next 5 years. Achieving this target will be a challenge as Viet Nam is currently \nfacing  the  multi-year  budget  deficits  (4.3%  of  GDP  in  2016  and  3.5%  of  GDP  in  2017, \nrespectively).7 At the same time, the banking sector is weak, under-capitalized and unable to \neffectively mobilize long-term domestic resources to finance these investments. Non-performing \nloans (NPL) and problem banks continue to pose threats to the entire financial system and limit \nits ability to support the real sector. The government has also recognized that alternative funding \nsources will be needed, and that a stable and developed domestic capital market will be the main \nchannel to mobilize longer-term domestic resources. However, Viet Nam\u2019s capital market is  \nunder-developed, with domestic government bond market representing only 38% of GDP in 2017, \ncompared to an average 70% in emerging East Asia. The corporate bond market is highly illiquid \nand only represented 3.2% of GDP as of end 2017. \n \n6.  In addition, empirical evidence shows a direct linkage between financial inclusion and \nincome equality. This is because financial exclusion deprives the poor of opportunities to increase \nincomes through savings, access capital for investment, and mitigate financial risks arising from \nnatural disasters and economic shocks.8 In Viet Nam, financial inclusion is low by all measures \n(Figure 1). In 2017, only 30.8% of adults had a bank account, compared to 81.6% in Thailand and \n85.3% in Malaysia. These measures are even lower among the poorest 40% of the population \n(20.0%) and the rural inhabitants (25.0%). The percentage of Vietnamese adults with savings at \na financial institution was only 14.5%, much lower than those of many regional peers. 9   \nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion Index  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

Washington, DC.   \n9  World Bank. Financial Inclusion Data/Global Findex 2017.  \n ", "3 \n7.  Financial stability, capital market development and financial inclusion are the three key \npillars of finance sector development. Financial stability ensures investor confidence, attracts \nlong-term  investment,  and  reduces  the  overall  business  operating  costs.  Capital  market \ndevelopment facilitates longer-term, stable and affordable funding sources for public investment \nin social sectors and infrastructure. Finally, financial inclusion ensures wider participation and that \nthe economic benefits generated are accessible to all.  \n \n8.   Binding  constraints.  The  government  recognizes  the  challenges  that  need  to  be \naddressed in its efforts to reform the finance sector. Three key binding constraints have been \nidentified: (i) limited capacity to maintain finance sector stability; (ii) underdeveloped capital \nmarkets; and (iii) low financial inclusion. \n \n9.   Limited capacity to maintain finance sector stability. Coordinated oversight of both \nindividual institutions and the overall financial system is necessary to maintain financial stability \neffectively. The government faces three key impediments to maintaining financial stability. First, \nthe current supervisory and regulatory framework is divided among multiple agencies, which \noperate without a comprehensive financial stability framework. Second, banking supervision \nremains weak and does not meet international standards, such as Basel 2. Banks\u2019 lending \npractices remain risky and credit continues to flow into unproductive sectors, such as SOEs and \nreal estate. Although the government reduced the NPL ratio from 17% in September 2012 to \naround 5% by the end of 2017,10 effective NPL resolution has been nominal, as the Vietnam Asset \nManagement  Company  (VAMC)  is  constrained  by  limited  capital,  restrictive  laws,  and \ncumbersome foreclosure processes.11 Third, the underlying architecture of Viet Nam\u2019s finance \nsector threatens financial stability. The use of a commercial bank to support the settlement of \ngovernment securities transactions introduces credit risk into what should be a risk-free process. \nThe Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS) do not reflect the International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS), distorting financial disclosures and inhibiting robust risk management.   \n \n10.  Underdeveloped capital market. The government has made measurable progress in \ndeveloping Viet Nam\u2019s capital market in recent years, including a more regular issuance pattern \nof government securities at key tenors. However, the government\u2019s reforms have not consistently \nembraced  the  necessary  sequencing,  leaving  some  fundamental  development  constraints \nunresolved. First, the capital market is not supported by a reliable short-term interest rate \nbenchmark, which is often derived from a functioning and liquid money market. The lack of a \nshort-term reference rate inhibits the accurate market valuation of financial instruments and \nprevents  the  development  of  more  advanced  markets,  such  as  derivatives.  Second,  while \nbenchmark securities are forming at key tenors, they have not yet reached critical mass. Historical \noperational restrictions and the lack of a strong institutional investor base with a demand for longer \ndated assets have limited the average maturity of government bonds to just over 4 years in 2015. \nFinally, Viet Nam\u2019s categorization as a \u201cfrontier\u201d market and limits on the foreign ownership of \npublic companies have discouraged the entry of international investors with the capacity to \nsupport and bring international best practices into the domestic market. \n11.   Low financial inclusion. Inadequate access to financial services and products, low \nfinancial literacy, and incomplete consumer protection have excluded a large share of the adult \npopulation from the finance sector. First, financial services for low-income people remain centered \non government-subsidized microcredit provided by the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP). \n                                                \n10 The figure as of the end of September 2012 was based on closer surveillance by the SBV. The figure by the end of \n2017 was reported by credit institutions and the VAMC. \n11 Since its inception in 2013, the VAMC has acquired from credit institutions an estimated $14 billion worth of NPLs, \nof which only about 27.5% have been resolved.  \n ", "4 \nSecond, other financial services for the poor and migrant workers such as savings, payments, \nremittances, and microinsurance services have not been fully developed. Viet Nam has a huge \npotential to adopt technology to leapfrog the traditional stages of financial sector development \nand support greater financial inclusion thanks to the high digital connection rates and the young \nand technology-savvy population. However, development of financial technology in Viet Nam is \nstill at an early stage. In 2017, only 23% of Vietnamese adults had used digital payments. The \ngovernment has yet to provide a comprehensive development and regulatory framework for digital \nfinancial services and agent banking. These services often require lower cost of operations, have \nlarge  distribution  networks  and  can  enable financial  institutions  to  compete  with  VBSP  on \ncommercial terms. In addition, the Law on Insurance should be amended to allow microinsurance \nfor low-income customers to mitigate risks associated with a loss of income and assets. Finally, \nfinancial literacy in Viet Nam is low, with the financial literacy index (12.0) being one of the lowest \namong 30 countries.12 National financial literacy programs should be developed and rolled out \nnation-wide to better target the financially excluded population.   \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.   The government\u2019s reform agenda. The Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u20132020 \nseeks to promote a modern and equitable market economy. The government targets economic \ngrowth of 6.5%\u20137.0%, an increase in per capita GDP to $3,200\u2013$3,500, and a 1.0%\u20131.5% annual \nreduction in the poverty rate by 2020.13 Recognizing the importance of financial stability, capital \nmarket development, and financial inclusion in achieving these targets, the government has \ninitiated a series of finance sector reforms intended to strengthen the finance sector. In addition, \nthe government has completed a bond market road map for 2017\u20132020 that focuses on improving \nthe  liquidity  of  both  primary  and  secondary  markets,  extending  the  average  maturity  of \ngovernment bonds, and encouraging the participation of long-term nonbank investors. Finally, \nwhile Viet Nam\u2019s financial inclusion agenda is at an early stage, the government has placed an \nincreasing focus on expanding financial access for the unserved and the underserved. The \nNational  Financial  Inclusion  Strategy  (NFIS),  which  builds  on  the  ADB-supported  National \nMicrofinance  Development  Strategy  2011\u20132020,14 is  being  formulated  to  incorporate  new \ndevelopments in inclusive finance including digital financial services and financial literacy. \n \n13.  Policy reforms. The program is aligned with the SEDS, 2011\u20132020 and aims to increase \nthe role of the nonbank finance sector and deepen the financial markets in Viet Nam. The effect \nof  these  reforms  is  a  deeper  and  more  inclusive  finance  sector.  Subprogram  1  contains  \n26 reform measures, 9 of which are policy triggers and 17 are policy milestones.15 All subprogram \n1 policy actions have been accomplished. Subprogram 2 contains 25 reform policy actions, 8 of \nwhich are expected prior actions.  \n \n14.  Finance sector stability strengthened. This reform area will institutionalize financial \nstability functions, strengthen the banking sector and the underlying infrastructure. Subprogram \n1 achieved several targets. First, the SBV established a framework for a formal financial stability \nfunction supported by systemic risk surveillance. To reduce systemic risk, the SBV required all \ncommercial banks to fully comply with Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 of the Basel 2 standardized approach \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

Ha Noi. \n15 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement condition, and policy milestones strengthen the program. \n ", "5 \nby 2020. This reform was complemented by immediate actions to reduce the sector\u2019s reliance on \nshort-term volatile funding, reduce related party lending, tighten securities margin lending, and \ndeter speculative real estate lending activities. Second, the SBV amended the Law on Credit \nInstitutions to introduce prompt corrective actions for problem banks based on their level of \ncapital. The new law specifies the resolution regime for problem banks, including rehabilitation, \nforced merger and acquisition and declaration of bankruptcy. This provided the SBV with a \nstronger legal mandate to resolve weak credit institutions which have been a drag to the banking \nsector. The SBV also strengthened the VAMC\u2019s ability to acquire effective control of bad debts by \nutilizing a wider array of funding mechanisms. Finally, the government addressed long-standing \nweaknesses in financial infrastructure by amending the Law on Accounting to gradually align the \nVAS with the IFRS and implementing a roadmap to strengthen the securities settlement process.  \n \n15.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  implement  the  reforms  begun  under \nsubprogram 1 by strengthening systemic risk surveillance and banking sector performance. The \nSBV  will:  (i)  implement  supervisory  guidelines  for  systemically  important  domestic  banks;  \n(ii) develop mechanisms to monitor and control financial stability risks; (iii) implement the early \nintervention  and  resolution  framework  for  weak  credit  institutions;  and  (iv)  adopt  a  formal \nsupervisory bank rating system. The SBV will require all banks to fully comply with Basel 2, \nincluding the implementation of Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) by 2021, \nand will further reduce the banking system\u2019s reliance on short-term funding.  \n \n16.  Domestic capital market broadened and deepened. This reform area will: (i) further \ndevelop the money market; (ii) deepen and enlarge the government bond market; and (iii) develop \nan institutional investor base. Subprogram 1 has several accomplishments. The SBV allowed a \nwider foreign exchange trading range for the dong, installed a Reuters platform to capture \ninterbank money market activities, and completed a diagnostic to support the establishment of a \nshort-term interest rate benchmark. To increase activities and liquidity in the money market, the \nSBV provided regulatory relief and prepared a standardized repurchase agreement. To provide a \nterm structure of interest rates, the government conducted a continuous primary auction process \nof government securities at key tenors of the yield curve, including the 30-year tenor, and \nintroduced the prerequisites for an active secondary market. To develop an institutional investor \nbase, the government provided an enabling environment for private pension funds and authorized \nthe social security system to invest in government bonds. Efforts to upgrade Viet Nam to \n\u201cemerging market\u201d status were begun, with a focus on liberalizing foreign ownership restrictions \non listed companies.  \n \n17.  Under subprogram 2, the SBV will take additional measures to support a more active \nforeign exchange market and will implement reforms to improve transparency in the money \nmarket. The SBV will fully identify constraints to money market development and will facilitate the \ncompletion of key legal opinions from trade associations. The government will continue its primary \nauction process across all maturities and will enhance liquidity by building benchmarks and \nreducing the number of outstanding issues. A legal framework for a Primary Dealer system and \nthe associated liquidity support facility will be completed and the development of derivatives will \nbe actively pursued. To foster the development of an institutional investor base, the government \nwill allow the operation of private pension funds and encourage the participation of social security \nsystem in the government bond auctions. Finally, to further promote capital market development, \nthe government will revise the Securities Law to be more aligned with international standards, \nincluding corporate governance, disclosure, and investor protection. \n \n18.  Financial inclusion promoted. This reform area will provide holistic support for access \nto financial services by the unserved and underserved population. Although the financial inclusion \n ", "6 \nagenda is at a very early stage, subprogram 1 has achieved notable accomplishments. The SBV \nwas appointed the national coordinator for planning and implementing national financial inclusion \ninitiatives. The SBV\u2019s Fintech Steering Committee was established and a framework to promote \nnoncash payment services was developed as prerequisites for promoting financial technology to \nachieve greater financial inclusion. To create an enabling environment for the microfinance sector, \nthe SBV formalized the legal framework for the sector and introduced a framework to foster \nalternative payment systems. The government introduced agent-based microinsurance as a new \nfinancial product. Finally, an improved rating system that focused on governance and asset quality \nenhanced the supervision of people\u2019s credit funds.  \n \n19.   Subprogram 2 will strengthen the legal framework for financial inclusion to include new \ndevelopments such as financial technology while increasing focus on financial literacy and \nconsumer protection. The government will develop a national financial inclusion framework \nincluding  financial  literacy  programs  such  as  national  television  game  shows  on  financial \nknowledge. In addition, to enhance financial inclusion through innovation and to promote a \ncashless society, the SBV will develop and implement an action plan to develop financial \ntechnology in Viet Nam. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will submit the proposal to the National \nAssembly to include microinsurance business in the revised Law on Insurance. The new rating \nsystem will be fully applied to people\u2019s credit funds to strengthen their governance and capital \nbase. The SBV will evaluate and register microfinance programs and projects under the new \nframework and raise awareness on the new licensing regime for MFIs.  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s experience and strategy. ADB\u2019s engagement in finance sector development in \nViet Nam began with three successive clusters of finance sector program loans (Figure 2). \nBuilding on these engagements, the Financial Sector Deepening Program adopted a sequenced \napproach to address outstanding foundational constraints to capital market development by \nfostering the emergence of a money market and government securities market. At the same time, \nADB  supported  financial  inclusion  through  the  Microfinance  Development  Program.16 Both \nprograms were rated successful.17 This program represents the next logical step in ADB\u2019s support \nby combining finance sector development and financial inclusion under an umbrella framework \ndesigned to bring together the supply and demand sides of finance sector development. The \nprogram will also complement ADB\u2019s efforts to improve public expenditure efficiency.18 The \nprogram is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030 (Table 1).19 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Program \n1.

Lessons learned. The program\u2019s design was informed by four key lessons learned \nthrough ADB\u2019s engagement in finance sector development.20 First, the pace of reforms must be \nat a pace that recognizes that finance sector reform is a long-term process and requires proper \nsequencing. The effectiveness of foundation reforms should be fully demonstrated before more \ncomplex reforms are introduced. Second, to increase government ownership, the program, should \nbe focused and consist of targeted high-impact policy actions. Third, complementary reforms are \nnecessary to increase financial stability and boost investor confidence and participation. Finally, \nfinancial inclusion reforms should adopt a holistic approach, considering both the supply and \ndemand side, and incorporating new developments in financial inclusion. \n \n22.   ADB\u2019s value addition to the program.  ADB\u2019s long term engagement in the finance \nsector has helped ensure that the reform areas are well-sequenced and policy actions are well \nformulated. Through policy dialogue and technical assistance (TA), ADB has contributed directly \nto several reforms under the program. As the lead donor, ADB has supported the SBV to establish \nand strengthen the financial stability function. ADB\u2019s rapid response to the government\u2019s needs \nhave contributed to the amendment of the Credit Institutions Law which provided the SBV with \nstrong legal mandate to resolve NPLs and restructure problem banks. Through the OneADB \napproach,  ADB  experts  from  Southeast  Asia  Department  and  Treasury  Department  are \nsupporting the government\u2019s efforts to develop a short-term benchmark interest rate through \npolicy dialogue and capacity development. ADB also provided an interbank transaction reporting \nplatform to increase transparency and is supporting the early-stage development of derivatives \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s assistance was instrumental in establishing a framework for the development of \nprivate pension funds. ADB is also the lead donor in financial inclusion with the support to develop \nthe national microfinance development strategy 2011\u20132020, which provided a foundation for the \nforthcoming NFIS. Finally, ADB\u2019s capacity development to the policymakers and partnership with \nthe  private  sector  on  Fintech  Challenge  events  have  provided  the  foundation  for  fintech \ndevelopment for greater financial inclusion in Viet Nam. \n \n23.   ADB\u2019s assistance has contributed to impressive results. Average trading volume per \ntransaction in the government bond market increased by nearly eight times from VND 1.2 trillion \nin 2010 to VND 9.2 trillion in 2017. The average maturity of government debts increased from  \n3.2 years in 2013 to 12.7 years in 2017. The share of outstanding government bonds held by the \ncontractual savings industry increased from 15.4% in 2013 to 45.8% in 2017, and 47.5% in \nSeptember  2018,  respectively.  The  combined  stock  market  capitalization  of  the  two  stock \nexchanges increased from 19% of GDP in 2010 to nearly 75% of GDP in 2017. Regarding \nfinancial inclusion, the revised Credit Institution Law designated MFIs as credit institutions and \nput them under the SBV\u2019s supervision. Microfinance regulations were developed to guide the \nMFIs\u2019  operations,  and  the  regulators\u2019  supervisory  capacity  improved  significantly.  The \ngovernment also approved a strategy to transform the VBSP into a more self-sustaining financial \ninstitution capable of carrying out market-based operations. Four private MFIs have been licensed, \nmost recently in 2016. In 2017, the SBV licensed a total 9 microfinance programs and projects \noperated by the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU), which serve primarily low-income female \nclients. From 2014\u20132016, the number of microfinance borrowers increased by 3 million, the \nnumber of depositors increased by 2 million and outstanding loans increased by 15%. \n \n24.   Development partner coordination. To ensure that efforts to develop Viet Nam\u2019s finance \nsector are complementary, a donor coordination committee led by the World Bank meets quarterly. \nADB is leading capital market development by providing targeted support to develop money and \ndebt capital markets, as well as selective efforts to strengthen financial stability, the microfinance \nsector, and financial technology. ADB is coordinating with the World Bank to promote financial \ninclusion, including support to develop and implement the NFIS. The Government of Canada \n(through Global Affairs Canada) is supporting efforts to strengthen banking supervision, and the \nGovernment of Japan (through the Japan International Cooperation Agency) has been helping \nthe government develop the banking sector and NPL resolution strategies. ADB has collaborated \nclosely with the International Monetary Fund and the policy actions under the program are \nconsistent with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s assessment and recommendations. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n25.  Economic impacts of the program. This program addresses Viet Nam\u2019s need for \ncomprehensive finance sector reforms. The program impact assessment estimates the program\u2019s \npotential net benefits at approximately $751 million. The present value of the program\u2019s aggregate \nbenefits is approximately $1.5 billion, which flows from reduced risk premiums on debt, increased \nintermediation from the nonbank sector, and greater inclusion through the microfinance sector. \nThe present value of the program\u2019s aggregate costs is $708 million due primarily to the additional \ninterest cost associated with maintaining a term structure of interest rates over increasing \nmaturities. The compliance costs to the banking sector associated with the adoption of Basel 2 \nare also expected to be substantial. 21 \n \n                                                \n21 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n26.  The government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has requested a programmatic \napproach, comprising two subprograms, and a concessional loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The indicative loan \namount for subprogram 2 is $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The proceeds of \nthe policy-based loan will be disbursed to Viet Nam in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n27.  Viet Nam\u2019s total financing needs for 2016\u20132020 are expected to be substantial, with \nannual budget deficits projected at 3.5%\u20134.0% of GDP. The government\u2019s borrowing needs for \n2018 are estimated at $17 billion, of which official development assistance and concessional \nloans are estimated at $3.6 billion. The size of subprogram 1 reflects the government\u2019s financing \nneeds, the strength of the reform and development expenditures arising from the program. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The executing agency is the SBV, and the implementing agencies are the MOF, State \nSecurities Commission, Hanoi Stock Exchange, and SBV. Subprogram 1 was implemented from \nJuly 2015 to June 2018. Subprogram 2 began in July 2018 and will be implemented through June \n2020. While a formal coordinating committee has not been created to support the program, \nspecific reform measures, such as the development of a short-term interest rate benchmark and \nthe introduction of derivatives, have given rise to formal coordination structures across and within \nministries, and serve to catalyze broader cooperation.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.   Safeguards. The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguards policies and is classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous people.  \n \n30.  Poverty and social. Reforms under the program will help the government achieve its \npoverty reduction target by providing the poor with greater access to financial services. The \nprogram introduces two pro-poor products: (i) microinsurance, which provides a cushion against \nunexpected loss; and (ii) alternative payment systems, which will increase the access of the poor \nto low-cost financial services. Subprogram 1 is categorized as having some gender elements. By \nimproving the legal framework for microfinance operators under the VWU, which accounts for \n80% of all semiformal microfinance providers, more women will be able to access savings \nproducts and apply for larger loans with a lower administrative burden and cost. The program also \nintroduces  new  financial  services  such  as  microinsurance  that  will  benefit  lower  income \ncustomers, many of whom are women.22 \n \n31.  Governance.  A  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted  and  noted  several \nweaknesses in governance, public financial management, procurement, and anticorruption.23 \nChallenges hampering public financial management include: (i) inefficient domestic resource \nmobilization; (ii) unproductive public resource allocation; (iii) low budget reliability; and (iv) weak \n                                                \n22 United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). 2016.

To address these challenges, ADB has supported the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen public financial management systems through policy dialogue \nand  targeted  public financial  management  interventions.  ADB  also  supported the technical \ndrafting of the revised Procurement Law and related prime ministerial decisions that regulate \nprivate sector investment. Since 2014, ADB has provided the government with more targeted \nsupport  for  enhancing  public  asset  management  systems,  strengthening  public  debt \nmanagement,  reducing  risks  associated  with  government  guarantees,  and  strengthening \noversight of budget implementation (footnote 18). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n32.  Risks and Mitigating Measures. The program has five substantial risks. First, the return \nof macroeconomic instability could depress capital market activities. Second, economic pressure \nmay prevent the government from applying market principles to the microfinance sector, blunting \nsome of the proposed reforms. The government can mitigate this risk by continuing to strengthen \nmacroeconomic conditions and reform SOEs. Third, governance risk may arise from weak public \nmanagement practices and corruption. The government, with ADB\u2019s assistance, can mitigate this \nrisk by strengthening the public financial management system. Fourth, vested interest might \nrestrain government efforts to reform state-owned commercial banks. Finally, high fiscal pressure \ncould lead to further cuts in the resources available for government staff training. The government, \nwith support from development donors, can continue strengthening the capacity of its staff to \nundertake key policy reforms. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan. 24 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the \nabsence of the President under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nI recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Financial Sector Development and Inclusion \nProgram, and \n(ii)  the loan of $100,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of \nthe Financial Sector Development and Inclusion Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% \nper year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n13 November 2018 \n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nRole of the non-bank finance sector increased and financial markets in Viet Nam deepened (Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020).a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the  By 2021:     \nReform  a.
