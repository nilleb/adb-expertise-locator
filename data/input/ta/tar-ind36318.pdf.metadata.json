INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2002  India  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  India \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to extend its support beyond the three focal \nstates (Gujarat,  Kerala  and  Madhya  Pradesh), to address growing interregional disparities. \nAssam is a key state for economic growth of the northeastern region of India and is facing a \nserious fiscal crisis. Given a strong commitment of the Government of Assam (GOA) to reform, \nADB and the Government of India agreed that technical assistance (TA) and a loan would be \nprovided to support reform of Assam\u2019s financial1 and power sectors. An ADB mission visited \nGuwahati, the state capital, and Delhi from 12 to 24 September to undertake fact-finding for the \nTA to prepare the Assam Power Sector Development Program. The mission held discussion \nwith GOA, Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB), central government officials, and concerned \nbilateral aid agencies, and reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, cost, and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2002 country program for \nIndia.2  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Assam is a small state with a total population of 26.6 million. It is in the center of \nnortheastern India and is a strategic corridor for southeast Asia. Assam\u2019s per capita income of \nRs9,6123 is  almost  two-thirds  of  the  national  average;  89  %  of  its  population  are  widely \nscattered in rural areas, and 41% are living below the poverty line. The gross fiscal deficit has \nreached 10% as a percentage of the state domestic product in FY2000 and is still increasing. \nAlthough Assam is blessed with natural resource such as oil, natural gas, and minerals and has \nthriving tea and rubber plantations, its industry has not grown significantly since independence \nbecause investments from outside the state have been deterred by law and order problems and \nethnic unrest.  Poor performance of the power sector has also been a major impediment to \nindustrial growth. Per capita electricity consumption at 104 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is less than one \nthird of the national average and the lowest in India. Therefore, improved power supply at a \nreasonable cost is essential to revive the state industry and economy. Of equally importance is \nrestoring the sector to financial sustainability so that it is no longer a drain on state finances. \n \n3.  In  March  2001,  GOA  signed  a  memorandum  of  understandings  with  the  central \ngovernment and committed to reforming its power sector to provide good quality power to all the \npeople in the state and to achieve commercial viability in the power sector so that it can finance \nits investment needs and is not dependent on budgetary subsidies. Based on the memorandum \nof understanding, some reform action has been initiated by GOA and ASEB in areas such as \npolicy and regulatory framework, efficiency improvement, financial restructuring, and human \nresource management. \n \n4.  Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission (AERC) has been constituted as a one-person \ncommission in August 2001. AERC is now reviewing the first tariff petition by ASEB and will \nneed to deal with more complicated regulatory matters as the reform program goes along. \nGiven the critical role of AERC in the reform process, ADB will provide a TA in 2003 for capacity \n                                                 \n1 A loan \u201cAssam Governance and Public Resource Management \u201c is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 country program for \nIndia. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 1 July 2002. \n3 Estimate for FY2000 at current prices. ", "2 \nbuilding for AERC4 to support its full functioning.  GOA is in the process of developing a new \npower sector policy, which describes development objectives, strategies on the sector reform \nand capital investment, and the role of the government for the sector development. This policy \nwill become a basis for a reform act of the state. GOA targets the end of October 2002 for \ncabinet approval of the new sector policy and March 2003 for enactment of the reform act. GOA \nhas also started to draft its new anti-power-theft legislation. \n \n5.  ASEB is a vertically integrated utility, fully owned by GOA. It has an installed capacity of \n574.5 megawatt (MW) comprising 572.5 MW of thermal and 2 MW of hydropower. Of the \nthermal capacity, 300 MW is not operational due to reasons such as costly fuel, design \nproblems, and inadequate maintenance. This results in plant load factor of 15% as compared to \nthe national average of 70%. ASEB\u2019s own system meets only 120 MW out of total peak demand \nof 594 MW. The deficiency is being met by purchasing power from central power sector utilities \nand neighboring states. Transmission and distribution losses are estimated at 40% due to lack \nof investment and maintenance and nontechnical losses. Given that the future supply gaps is to \nbe met by purchasing more power at a reasonable cost, ADB and ASEB agreed that the priority \nfor ADB\u2019s project loan would be given to strengthening transmission and distribution networks, \ninstalling energy audit and consumer meters, and modernizing the billing and collection system. \nAlthough  ASEB  has  some  generation  projects  in  its  long-term investment plan, additional \ninvestment in generation needs to be carefully reviewed for cost effectiveness.   \n \n6.  Due to the low plant load factor and high transmission and distribution losses, power \nsupply in Assam costs about Rs5.9 per kWh, which is the highest in all Indian states. The \naverage retail tariff covers only 62% of the cost, resulting in ASEB\u2019s accumulated loss of Rs44 \nbillion as of March 2002. ASEB has not been able to meet its operating cash requirements, and \nposted an operating cash deficit of Rs2.5 billion in FY2002. To restore financial viability to the \npower sector, operational efficiency improvements and financial restructuring of ASEB are \nessential. In line with the recommendations by an ADB TA5, ASEB has introduced a profit center \napproach  in  its  14  distribution  circles  as  a  first  step  to  unbundling  and  corporatizing  its \noperations. Income and expenditure accounts of distribution operations have been separated \nfrom the head quarter so the financial performance of each distribution circle can be monitored. \nHeads of the circles have been given increased autonomy in financial and human resource \nmanagement. A similar approach will be introduced in generation and transmission as well. To \nstrengthen enforcement of the antitheft law, a task force was formed for all subdivisions.  The \ntask force comprises an ASEB engineer, an executive magistrate, and a local police officer. In \nall circles, billing and collection and maintenance functions have been separated to sharpen \nfocus on revenue collection.  As a result of these measures and the reducted cost of power \npurchase, ASEB\u2019s operational cash deficit for April to August in FY2003 has been halved, to \nRs614 million, from that of the corresponding period in FY2002.  \n \n7.  To make a fresh start under a reformed power sector, ASEB needs to clean up its \nbalance sheet through drastic financial restructuring. Unpaid energy dues from the public sector \namounted to approximately Rs0.9 billion as of March 2002, mostly represented by arrears from \nmunicipalities.  ASEB is contemplating securitization6 of these arrears with the debtors and \nGOA. The rural electrification subsidy associated with unmetered rural consumers has never \nbeen paid by GOA and has accumulated to Rs9.7 billion as of March 2002. In addition to this, \n                                                 \n4 AOTA \u201cCapacity Building of Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission\u201d ($400,000) is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 \ncountry program for India.   \n5 ADB. 2000.

", "  3\namounts that should have been paid by GOA for ASEB to ensure meeting the statutory 3%  rate \nof return has amounted to Rs38.7 billion as of March 2002; the loans from GOA to ASEB \namounted to Rs32.6 billion as of March 2002. As  suggested by ADB, ASEB has started a \ndiscussion with GOA on off setting these cross-liabilities.  \n \n8.  As a part of financial restructuring efforts, GOA has signed a tripartite agreement with \nthe central government and Reserve Bank of India with regard to securitization of dues from all \ncentral government power suppliers, including National Thermal Power Corporation, Powergrid, \nand North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO) outstanding as of September 2001. \nGOA has also agreed to securitize dues from all central government fuel suppliers outstanding \nas of September 2001, and is waiting for clearance to sign a tripartite agreement. ASEB has \ndefaulted  on  payment of some of bonds, loans from financial institutions, and GOA. The \ndefaulted capital liabilities excluding GOA loans amounts to Rs5.3 billion as of March 2002. As a \nseparate exercise in the financial restructuring for sector reform, ASEB will soon start debt \nrestructuring discussions with its creditors. \n \n9.  As more than 90% of the state is rural, how rural electrification should be addressed \nunder the reformed power sector structure is a major reform issue.  Presently, 77% of all rural \nvillages in the state have access to power at a single intake point, leaving approximately 5,700 \nvillages unelectrified. Even in the electrified villages, many people are unconnected due to a \nlack of lines within villages. Most of the connected rural consumers are unmetered and heavily \nsubsidized, representing 14% of total consumers, 12% of total energy consumption, and a \nnegligible portion in total revenue. Given the central government\u2019s policy to achieve 100% rural \nelectrification by 2012 and the critical condition of the state budget, ASEB has decided to \npurchase and install meters on the premises of all unmetered consumers by September 2003 \nand proposed under its first tariff proposal to AERC to eliminate the subsidized tariff for rural \nconsumers.  However,  as  in  rural  areas  many  of  the  consumers  are  very  poor  and  the \ninfrastructure tends to have a high capital cost per consumer, it is not financially viable to keep \nextending  distribution  lines  while  charging  normal  rates  to  the  consumers.  A  new  rural \nelectrification policy and mechanism need to be developed to continue rural electrification in a \nfinancially sustainable manner. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is attached as \nAppendix 1. \n \n10.  Due to a long freeze in recruitments, ASEB suffers a serious gap in the age and skills \nmix of its labor. ASEB has a serious shortage of technical staff in their 30s and 20s. ASEB has \nproposed a voluntary retirement scheme to GOA to promote change, be able and resume \nrecruitment. However, neither ASEB or GOA  has sufficient budget to implement the scheme. \nRetraining and redeployment of the employees are also urgently required to meet ASEB\u2019s \nemerging business profile. Nontechnical employees need to be retrained and redeployed as \ntechnical staff such as meter readers. Technical staff also need to be retrained to be deployed \nin finance and accounting functions, which are major areas to be strengthened for the reform.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  assist  GOA  and  ASEB  to  prepare  a  power  sector \ndevelopment program aiming to improve sector performance both technically and financially. \nProposing policy and legislative reforms to address issues constraining sector development will ", "4 \nalso be an integral part of the TA. The TA\u2019s objective will be considered achieved when an \nappropriate policy, legal, and regulatory framework is in place, initial reform measures have \nbeen taken, and immediate investment projects have been prepared.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will start with legal and regulatory support to lay down the basic framework of the \nreform. Within the framework, detailed study of sector structure, financial restructuring, poverty \nreduction, and investment planning will be undertaken to meet the reform objectives. Advice on \nlegal issues and stakeholder communication will be provided throughout TA implementation.     \n \n13.  The scope of work consists of (i) supporting reform-related legislation and providing legal \nadvice; (ii) developing a short/medium term reform agenda and a long-term reform plan; (iii) \nproposing options for a sector structure after unbundling ASEB, including reconfiguration of \ndistribution; (iv) developing a rural electrification policy suitable in the context of the sector \nreform; (v) reviewing accounts and accounting practice and preparing financial statements for \nFY2002  based  on  international  accounting  standards;  (vi)  developing  a  10year  financial \nprojection model and identifying liabilities to be taken over by unbundled successor entities; (vii) \nreviewing ASEB\u2019s power system investment plan to identify priority projects suitable for ADB \nfinancing  and  undertaking  financial,  economic,  environmental,  resettlement,  and  social \nanalyses;  (viii)  assessing  the  reform  impact  on  the  poor  and  recommending  mitigating \nmeasures; (ix) supporting communications  with  stakeholders  and  (x)  providing  immediate \ncapacity building and training to the ASEB counterpart staff on  reform-related issues.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1million equivalent, consisting of $517,140 in \nforeign exchange and $482,860 in local currency equivalent. ADB will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost of $517,140 and $282,860 equivalent of the local currency cost for a total of \n$800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide  the remaining $200,000 \nequivalent through counterpart staff, support services, office accommodation and facilities. The \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm and international and \ndomestic  individual  consultants.  The  international  consulting  firm  will  provide  international \nconsultants who have expertise in power sector restructuring, financial and economic analysis, \npower  system  planning  and  transmission,  power  distribution,  and  resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment (14 person-months). The international consulting firm team will include supporting \ndomestic consultants with expertise in accounting, financial and economic analysis, power \ntransmission and distribution, power generation, poverty and social impact analysis, indigenous \npeople analysis, and environmental analysis (35 person-months). The international consulting \nfirm will engage these domestic consultants in accordance with arrangements acceptable to \nADB.  In addition, international and domestic individual experts with experience in legal and \nregulatory aspects of power sector restructuring in India will be recruited by ADB to assist in \nvarious legal, policy and regulatory matters (2 person-months). A domestic individual expert in \npublic relations will also be recruited by ADB to support stakeholder communication (3 person-\nmonths). ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of ", "  5\ndomestic consultants. For selection of a consulting firm, the quality-and cost-based selection \nmethod with the simplified technical proposal will be used. \n \n16.  The state Department of Power and ASEB will be the executing agencies for the TA. \nASEB will be responsible for the day-to-day work associated with the TA. The secretary (power) \nof GOA will be responsible for overall coordination among ADB, GOA, and ASEB. As a \ncounterpart of the TA consultants, ASEB will form task teams in finance and commercial headed \nby ASEB\u2019s member (finance), technical headed by ASEB\u2019s (technical), and human resources \nheaded by ASEB\u2019s member (personnel and administration). Each task team will include at least \ntwo counterparts who have at least 10 years with ASEB or its successor entities. Under the TA, \nASEB  will  give  the  counterpart  staff  short-term  training  sessions  particularly  in  finance, \naccounting, and computer skills and will organize workshops on various reform issues, seen by \noutside resource persons. \n \n17.   ASEB  will  provide  office  accommodation,  local  communication  facilities,  and  other \nadministrative support including travel arrangements within Assam for the consultants. ASEB \nwill provide all available reports and information related to power sector reforms and proposed \ninvestment projects, and will facilitate collection of socioeconomic data by the consultants.  The \nTA budget provides for purchase of office equipment to be conducted by ASEB in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Appendix 3 \nprovides the outline terms of reference for the consultants. \n \n18.  The TA will be completed in about 8 months, from February 2003 to September 2003. \nThe  major  reports  required  from  the  consultants  and  the  number  of  months  after  TA \ncommencement by which the reports should be submitted are as follows: (i) an inception report \nto describe in detail the work program of the TA, with a time schedule and detailed work \nassignments ( 3 weeks); (ii) a first report describing progress of work, and status in accordance \nwith the original work program (2 months); (iii) a second report describing progress of work, and \nstatus  in  accordance  with  the  original  work  program  (4  months);  (iv)  a  draft  final  report \ndescribing the assignment on an overall basis, and highlighting any unfinished tasks (7 months); \nand (v) a final report, which is the draft final report after incorporating ADB\u2019s comments (8 \nmonths). \n \n19.  Each report will be discussed at a tripartite meeting consisting of GOA, ASEB, ADB, and \nthe consultants. Workshops and seminars will be organized by the consultants and ASEB from \ntime to time during TA implementation to disseminate information about the reform program to \nthe ASEB staff and other stakeholders. \n \n \nIV.
