INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Mandated by its Charter, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has played a catalytic role \nin promoting regional/ subregional cooperation by launching and fostering initiatives in Asia and \nthe Pacific. ADB\u2019s experience in regional/subregional cooperation has shown that, in addition to \nthe  economic  benefits  derived  from  such  cooperation,  cooperative  dialogue  and  sustained \ncooperation among neighboring countries builds interdependence and mutual trust.  Regional \ncooperation is a vital investment in maintaining peace and security, which in turn are necessary \nconditions for sustaining economic growth and development.  \n \n2.  Recent progress toward peace in Afghanistan has opened up an opportunity for economic \ncooperation among countries in South and Central Asia. A peaceful and stable Afghanistan offers \nthe possibility of a southern route from these countries to the Arabian Sea, through the corridors \nof Afghanistan-Pakistan and  Afghanistan-Iran. The need  of landlocked countries with limited \ndomestic markets, like Afghanistan and its neighboring countries in Central Asia, to access warm \nwater seaports, as well as other potential economic benefits, argues strongly in favor of economic \ncooperation among these countries. \n \n3.  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran1 participated in the ADB-hosted \nFirst Ministerial Conference on Transport and Trade in Central and South Asia, held in Manila on \n31 July\u20131 August 2003. All these countries confirmed their interest in subregional economic \ncooperation, focusing on transport and trade through the North-South Corridor2 and the East-\nWest Corridor3. These countries agreed to establish the Central and South Asia Transport and \nTrade Forum (CSATTF) as the instrument to facilitate transport  connectivity and trade in the \nsubregion and signed a Protocol (Appendix 1) to further promote such cooperation. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n  \n4.  Lessons Learned from  ADB-assisted Regional/Subregional Cooperation. Regional \ncooperation is one of ADB\u2019s key policies in pursuing its overarching goal of poverty reduction. \nAmong ADB\u2019s extensive experiences in regional cooperation, the Greater Mekong Subregional \n(GMS) cooperation program is the most successful. Under the GMS program, ADB has played a \nfacilitating role in bringing the participating countries together to develop and promote subregional \ncooperation. More than 100 cross-border projects have been identified in various sectors and \nseveral of these have been implemented, others are under processing or are being implemented. \nOther  major  ADB  subregional  initiatives  include  the  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) program initiated in 1997 among Azerbaijan, People\u2019s Republic of China, \nKazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan;  and  the  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  program  started  in  2001  among Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India and Nepal. \n \n5.  The major lessons learned from such ADB-assisted initiatives  are  that (i) economic \ncooperation should be based on commonalities in economic, political, historical, cultural, and \nsocial conditions; (ii) strong political will and long-term commitment of participating countries are \nkey to moving forward such cooperation; and (iii) cooperation should be determined by economic \nimperatives reflected by the benefits of concrete subregional investment projects. The grouping of \nthe various countries will be based on common economic interest of these projects. \n                                                 \n \n1   Turkmenistan was invited but did not send representatives to the Conference. \n2    Connecting Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the ports of Karachi, Port \nQasim and Gwadar. \n3   Connecting Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Afghanistan and Iran to the ports of Chabahar and \nBandar-e-Abbas. ", "2  \n \n6.  Ongoing  Economic  Cooperation  in  South  and  Central  Asia.  The  Economic \nCooperation  Organization  (ECO),  established  in  1985  by  Iran,  Pakistan,  and  Turkey,  was \nexpanded in 1992 to include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The key objective  was to promote sustainable socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the participating countries. Despite a number of agreements to facilitate trade \namong the member countries4 of ECO, intra-regional trade is only about 4% of the total ECO \ntrade. The lack of success in promoting trade among the participating countries is a result of the \npresence of nontrade barriers as well as a less than full commitment of some of the concerned \ncountries to regional cooperation. ECO is a diverse group of  countries, including many land-\nlocked countries that differ widely in geographical size and level of economic development. For \nexample, Afghanistan and many countries in Central Asia have relatively low per capita incomes, \ncompared with Iran and Turkey. Turkey also aspires to join the European Union and is thus giving \nECO\u2019s initiatives relatively a lower priority.      \n \n7.  The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Gas Pipeline Project (TAP Project) is a project \nspecific subregional economic cooperation that  ADB has been assisting.5 The objective is to \ntransport up to 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas from the Dauletabad fields in Turkmenistan \nto consumers in  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and possibly in India, by constructing  a 1,600km gas \npipeline. The TAP Project is serving as a vehicle for facilitating cooperative dialogue and actions \nby major countries in the subregion. ADB\u2019s role is that of a facilitator, and complex technical, \neconomic and political issues are being addressed to move the TAP Project forward. \n \n8.  Possible Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia. At the request of the \nGovernment of Afghanistan, ADB implemented a small-scale technical assistance (SSTA)  in \n2003  to  provide  an  analytical  and  empirical  basis  for  identifying  the  regional  economic \ncooperation potential for Afghanistan.6 The SSTA has shown that regional economic cooperation \nis essential for Afghanistan\u2019s economic and social development. Because Afghanistan is a \nlandlocked country with a small population, regional cooperation will help it gain access to \nseaports and to larger markets in the subregion and the rest of the world. Viewing Afghanistan\u2019s \nreconstruction in a regional context, peace, stability, and prosperity in Afghanistan could be a \ncatalyst for closer bonds between it and its neighbors such as Pakistan and Iran, and between \nthese countries and the Central Asian republics (CARs).  \n \n9.  A similar SSTA, exploring Pakistan\u2019s regional economic cooperation potential  has been \ncompleted.7 Pakistan provides a cost-efficient way of linking Afghanistan and the  countries of \nCentral Asia with markets in Asia and beyond by providing a shorter route to the Karachi port or \nthe newly developing port in Gwadar. Pakistan is also Afghanistan\u2019s main trading partner and \nAfghanistan\u2019s reexports to Pakistan through unofficial channels form an important component of \ntotal trade. The SSTA suggests that in view of complementarities and political considerations, an \neconomic cooperation grouping involving Pakistan, Afghanistan and some neighboring countries \nin South and Central Asia should be considered to promote rapid growth of intraregional trade as \nwell as trade with the rest of the world. \n \n10.   Three  CARs,  namely,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan  share  borders  with \nAfghanistan. They are endowed with rich natural resources and produce good quality cotton. The \nthree countries are all landlocked and their trade is conducted mainly by rails and roads, and \n                                                 \n \n4  These include: the Framework Agreement for Trade Cooperation that granted preferential treatment to the member \ncountries; the ECO Transit Trade Agreement; and ECO Transit Transport Framework Agreement. \n5  ADB. 2002.

", "  3 \npipelines passing through other Central Asian countries and connecting to Russia or, through \nRussia, to Europe. These countries are interested in cooperation with their southern neighbors \n(Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran) with a view to transporting substantial volumes of their major \nexports through Afghanistan to Pakistan and Iran. Such routes would reduce their distance from \nseaports.  \n \n11.  Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have been participating in the ADB-supported CAREC program \nwhich  has  developed  into  a  full-fledged  cooperation  program  among  seven  participating \ncountries.8 Important regional projects  in transport, trade facilitation and energy have been \nimplemented to address key development constraints facing countries in Central Asia, among \nothers, (i) to improve the economic connectivity within Central Asia and with the global economy; \n(ii) to enhance efficiency in use of energy and water resources; and (iii) to promote trade and \ntransit by removing non-tariff and non-physical barriers. Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are active \nparticipants in these projects. The opening of the corridors between Central Asia and South Asia \nwill add a new dimension to cooperation, generating synergy effects.  \n \n12.  The  participation  of  India  and  Iran  in  subregional  cooperation would further generate \nbenefits in the subregion. Both countries have good relations with Afghanistan and have provided \nhumanitarian  and  rehabilitation  assistance  for  its  reconstruction  efforts.  However, given the \ndifficult relations between India and Pakistan, India\u2019s participation in such an initiative is not likely \nin the short term. On the other hand, Iran  has shown keen  interest in subregional economic \ncooperation. It sent a deputy minister of commerce to the First Ministerial Conference. While Iran \nis not a member of ADB, it is one of the major trading partners of and investors in Afghanistan as \nwell  as  some  of  the  CARs.  Furthermore,  Iran  could  play  an  important  role  in subregional \ncooperation by providing the concerned countries with access to deep-sea ports. \n \n13.  Thus, subregional economic cooperation among Afghanistan and Pakistan in South Asia, \nand some neighboring countries in  Central Asia (as well as other interested  countries in the \nlonger term), focusing on projects in specific sectors is possible. Facilitating efforts need to start \nimmediately, given the strong political will being shown, particularly by the countries that attended \nthe CSATTF Ministerial Conference. Under the proposed TA, focus will be on the transport and \ntrade sectors in the initial stage, with possible extension of the coverage to other sectors in the \nfuture, including the energy sector in which both Afghanistan and Pakistan showed their keen \ninterest. These sectors were also the ones identified by the Afghanistan and Pakistan SSTAs. An \nopen  trading  regime  and  deeper  economic  integration  will  have  many  advantages  for  the \nsubregion. A process of harmonization and convergence of policies and strategies resulting from \nsuch subregional cooperation would help remove constraints to growth and development and \nallow each participating economy to reach a higher production potential. ADB can facilitate such a \nprocess by drawing on its extensive experience in regional cooperation.  As a tangible flagship \nproject to move subregional economic cooperation forward, a special emphasis will be placed on \nCSATTF. To avoid overlap and duplication, and to increase synergy with the  ADB-supported \nCAREC initiatives as well as those of other agencies, ADB will closely coordinate or cooperate \nwith ongoing regional/subregional activities in the subregion. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n14.  The  proposed  TA  builds  on  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  two  SSTAs \nconducted separately for  Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also accommodates the result of the \n                                                 \n \n8 ADB. 2002.

The main objective of the TA is to assist Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \nneighboring countries in Central and South Asia in jointly identifying and prioritizing subregional \ncooperation projects and programs. The TA\u2019s specific objectives are to (i) provide opportunities \nand  venues  including  the  Ministerial  Conferences,  for  cooperative  dialogue  among  the \nparticipating countries in the identified sectors, (ii) help identify potential subregional projects and \nprograms that have cross-border benefits; (iii) assist the participating countries in addressing key \ncross-border coordination issues; and more specifically (iv) support the CSATTF which aims at \ndiscussing issues pertaining to subregional trade and transport sectors and acting upon the \nprograms/projects to be identified and recommended.  The TA Framework is in  Appendix 2. \nBased on ADB experience, dialogue among participating countries needs to continue over a long \nperiod. Thus, follow-on TAs in this area may be required. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n15.  The proposed TA will provide opportunities for cooperative dialogue among Afghanistan, \nPakistan and other participating countries and help them identify common projects/programs and \ndevelop an action plan to implement these common projects. The main sectors to be covered by \nthe TA are transport and trade. The identified projects should include not only investment projects \nbut also TAs to develop an appropriate enabling environment and institutional arrangements for \nimplementing investment projects. The proposed TA will also support related activities that will \nenhance the regional cooperation process in South Asia. \n \n16.  Sector experts for the transport and trade sectors will prepare sector reports that will cover \na review of existing sector policy; an analysis of legal and institutional constraints; a review of \nongoing  and  planned  cross-border  projects;  recommendations  of  potential  cooperation \nprojects/programs in the sector; and needs assessment, including human resource development \nand capacity building, for implementing the action program in each sector. Sector experts will also \nprovide advisory services to be identified during TA implementation. The above sector work and \nadvisory assistance will take full account of the relevant sector work and capacity building \nassistance already carried out under CAREC program.9 Apart from these sector reports, one \nexpert will look into the possible areas or sectors for future cooperation in western Asia.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 and will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s funding program. Details are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Because the scope of the TA cuts across \nregional departments, close coordination between South Asia Department (SARD) and East and \nCentral Asia Department (ECRD) will be required during TA implementation. For this purpose, an \ninter-departmental team has already been set up, comprising staff from SARD and ECRD. This \nteam will constitute the core members of a secretariat to be established at ADB Headquarters. \n                                                 \n \n9   ADB. 2002.

Additional coordinating measures include (i) senior-level \ninter-departmental meetings as required; and (ii) joint missions. The other SARD/ECRD divisions \nwill implement their respective sector components of the TA. ; and other sector divisions as new \nareas for cooperation are identified.  Assigned staff at the ADB resident missions in Afghanistan \nand Pakistan as well as those in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and others when necessary will assist \nthe secretariat.  \n \n19.  At each participating country level, the government will establish a National Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Committee (NTTFC) as agreed upon during the First Ministerial Conference for \ncooperation in transport and trade sectors and  coordination among the organizations/policies \nconcerned. NTTFC will comprise the representatives of all ministries/agencies concerned and will \nbe headed by the finance minister or another appropriate minister. A similar national committee \nwill  be  established  for  the  new  sector  once  identified.  NTTFC  will  encourage  modernizing \npractices, procedures, and technology in the transport, trade and energy sectors that will help \npromote subregional economic cooperation.  \n \n20.  The Ministerial Conference, formalized during the First Ministerial Conference, will provide \noverall guidance and supervision in TA implementation. The  participating countries\u2019  finance \nministers or other appropriate designated ministers will represent the Ministerial Conference. \nSector-level  coordination  of  the  TA  among  the  participating  countries  will  be  accomplished \nthrough the respective sector working group meetings. These are operational groups, comprising \nsenior government officials from the line ministries concerned (representatives of NTTFC) and \nprivate sector representatives as appropriate. The working groups will review the sector technical \nreports, draft agreements and other reports, identify possible cooperation projects/programs in \nthe respective sectors and prioritize and recommend them to the Ministerial Conference for final \nendorsement. \n \n21.  Under the TA, international sector experts will be engaged for a total of 8 person-months \nfor  the  transport  and  trade  sectors,  and  other  sector  when  it  is  identified  during  TA \nimplementation. They will prepare sector reports as required and assist in implementing other TA \nactivities,  in  close  cooperation  with  the  concerned  sector  working  groups,  government \ncounterparts,  and  resident  missions  in  the  participating  countries.  They  will  report  to  the \ndesignated ADB mission leaders and will participate in the respective working group meetings to \npresent findings and recommendations. In addition, a senior TA advisor (international consultant) \nand a senior programs analyst (domestic consultant) will be engaged for 7 person-months and 10 \nperson-months respectively to support TA implementation. The two will be stationed at the \nsecretariat and provide mainly logistic services  in organizing  the Ministerial Conference and \nworking  group  meetings  and  preparing  the  necessary  documentation.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. ADB will select the consultants, on an individual \nbasis, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for \nselecting domestic consultants.  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months and be completed in February 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nthis Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.

The Agenda  of the  Conference  is in\nAppendix 1. A list of participants  is in Appendix 2.\n2.  Participating Countries assessed the economic impact  of  enhanced  regional\ntrade  and economic cooperation brought about by improved road corridors connecting\nCentral Asia and South Asia and the ports at the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.\nParticipating Countries concluded that the economic impact would be very considerable\nin terms of: (i) increase in Participating Countries' GDPs; (ii)  creating  employment\nopportunities; ~ii) savings on b\"ansportc ost and transport time; (iv) fostering competition\nfor transit trade; and, (v) reducing duties, excises and surcharges of traded commodities.\n3.  Participating  Countries  noted that they  can substantially  benefit  from  improved\naccess to Pakistan  and Iranian  ports at the Arabian  Sea and  the  Persian  Gulf.  Roads\nproviding  this  access  are:  (i)  the  North-South  Corridor  connecting  Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan  and Uzbekistan  through Afghanistan  and Pakistan  to the ports of Karachi,\nPort Qasim and Gwadar and (ii) the East-West  Corridor connecting  these  Central-Asian\ncountries  through Afghanistan  and Iran to the ports of Chabahar  and  Bandar-e-Abbas.\nParticipating  countries  noted  that many of these  roads  are  under  construction  by the\nParticipating  Country concerned  often with intemational  technical  and financial  support.\nSome  of  these  repairs,  upgradation  or  construction  will  require  additional  feasibility\nstudies and financing  (see attached maps and tables).\n4.\n(i)  ParticipatingC  ountriesb roadlye ndorsedt he two corridors namely the North-\nSouth and East-Westr oad corridorsc onnectingt he landlock countries of the Central\nAsian Republicsa nd Afghanistant o seaports of Bander-e-Abbas and, Chabahar in\nIran and Gwadar, Karachrand Port Qasim in Pakistan.\n(ii)  Participating Countries also emphasized and agreed that there are other\nalternative routes that can provide effective connectivity to the five seaports as\nmentioneda bove.
