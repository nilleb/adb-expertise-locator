The  Project  focuses  on  enhancing  the  quality  of \nAssessment  education and will have no negative environmental impact.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project will help the Government achieve its goal of poverty \nreduction  and  economic  development  by  providing  support  for \nenhancing the quality of education through institutional capacity \ndevelopment  for  planning,  design,  and  delivery  of  education \nservices and by strengthening secondary education.  \n   \nRationale  The Government accords high priority to enhancing the quality of \neducation to make the education system more efficient and to \nimprove  learning  achievements.  It  also  recognizes  that \ninvestments in secondary education are necessary to meet the \ngrowing demand for a well educated and skilled work force. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be an increased number of better \neducated  and  skilled  people  from  all  sections  of  Cambodia\u2019s \npopulation.  The  Project  will  achieve  this  by  carefully  targeting \nsupport for (i) education system management and development, \n(ii) professional development of teachers, and (iii) strengthening \nsecondary  education.  The  Project  outcome  will  be  improved \nquality and equity of education in Cambodia with more effective \nsecondary  education,  improved  teacher  training,  and  stronger \neducation management systems. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $33.38 million \nequivalent, including physical and price contingencies, taxes, and \nduties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  27.10    81.20 \nGovernment  6.28    18.80 \n  Total    33.38    100.00 \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "ii   \n  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a grant of $27.10 \nmillion,  or  81.2%  of  the  total  cost,  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining $6.28 million (18.8% of project costs) as \ncounterpart financing. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  April 2008 to 31 October 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport ( MoEYS)  \n   \nImplementation  MoEYS  will  be  responsible  for  project  coordination  and \nArrangements  implementation.  A  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  a \nsecretary of state, will provide overall guidance to the Project. \nMembers  of  the  project  steering  committee  will  include \nrepresentatives  from  the  departments  of  Planning,  Finance, \nTeacher  Training,  and  General  Secondary  Education,  the \nPedagogical  Research  Department  (PRD),  and  the  National \nInstitute  of  Education  (NIE).  The  steering  committee  will  also \ninclude  representatives  from  the  ministries  of  Economy  and \nFinance, Women's Affairs, and Planning. \n \n   \nProcurement  All goods and works financed under the Project will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  2007  (as \namended from time to time) reflecting ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date). \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide a total input of 553 person-months of \nconsulting  services  (219  person-months  international  and  334 \nperson-months national) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsulting services  are  designed not  only  to  provide  technical \nsupport to the project management and implementation but also \nto  build  longer-term  institutional  development  and  capacity  for \nplanning, management, and the delivery of teacher professional \ndevelopment and secondary education. The consulting services \ncover  broad  areas  of  expertise  that  include  (i)  institutional \ndevelopment,  (ii)  management  information  system  (MIS) \ndevelopment,  (iii)  teacher  professional  development,  (iv) \ncurriculum and materials development including information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT),  (v)  examination  reform,  (vi) \nfacilities  and  equipment  improvement,  and  (vii)  gender  and \nequitable access. \n   \n ", "  iii\nProject Benefits and  The Project will have substantial benefits for the education sector, \nBeneficiaries  in  particular  the  teacher  training  institutions  and  secondary \neducation.  \n \nDirect beneficiaries will be (i) MoEYS staff, including provincial \nand district office teams trained to strengthen their capacity to \nplan, manage, administer, and regulate the system; (ii) teacher \ntraining  colleges  (TTCs),  which  will  have  improved  facilities \nincluding  laboratories  and  libraries;  (iii)  academic  staff  and \nmanagement of the TTCs, who will benefit from inputs to upgrade \ncompetencies; (iv) approximately 14,400 current lower and upper \nsecondary  teachers  benefiting  from  in-service  training;  (v)  300 \nupper secondary schools benefiting from technical assistance in \nschool management, school networking, and school improvement \nplanning; (vi) 36 upper secondary schools which will be developed \nas resource schools; (vii) 350,000 upper secondary students who \nwill  be  provided  with  textbooks;  and  (viii)  approximately  7,000 \nupper secondary teachers who will be provided with teachers\u2019 \nguides. \nIn addition, 500 students will be provided with the opportunity to \ntrain as teachers through scholarships to NIE and regional teacher \ntraining colleges (TTCs). An additional 4,000 students will receive \nscholarships  for  upper  secondary  education.  Of  the  total \nscholarship beneficiaries, 60% will be females.  \nThe indirect beneficiaries will include (i) current and future trainee \nteachers who will benefit from improvements in preservice teacher \ntraining  curriculum  and  methodologies;  (ii)  students  in  lower \nsecondary  and  upper  secondary  schools  (both  those  currently \nenrolled and in the future) will be taught by better trained and \nmotivated teachers and hence will have more relevant skills and \nknowledge  and  thus  be  more  employable;  (iii)  employers  and \npotential  employers  will  have  employees  with  more  relevant \nattitudes, skills, and knowledge which will reduce the need for \ncostly  initial  training  of  recruits  and/or  returns  from  what  they \nundertake; and (iv) higher-education institutions which will have \nbetter prepared applicants. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The major risk stems from weak institutional and management \ncapacity to implement the range of activities provided. The Project \nmitigates  this  risk  by  providing  (i)  consulting  services  for  all \nactivities where capacity is perceived to be weak, (ii) adequate \ntime for activities to be completed satisfactorily, and (iii) a realistic \ntime frame for implementation over a 6-year period. \n   \n \n ", "103 o 00'E 107 o 00'E\nCAMBODIA\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nENHANCING EDUCATION QUALITY PROJECT DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nODDAR  MEANCHEY\nSamrong Cheom Ksan Siem Pang\n14 o 00'N THAILAND RATANAKIRI 14 o 00'N\nBANTEAY Tbeng Meanchey\nMEANCHEY STUNG Banlung\nTRENG\nPoipet Sisophon SIEM  REAP\nPREAH   VIHEAR\nLumphat\nMongkol Borey Stung Treng\nSiem Reap\nBattambang\nR.\nPAILIN Tonle ng  VIET    NAM\nPailin BATTAMBANG Sap KOMPONG Meko KRATIE\nTHOM\nMONDULKIRI\nMoung Roessei Kompong Thom Sambor\nSandan\nKratie Sen Monorom\nPursat Krakor\nPrek Kak\nSre Khtum\nKompong Chhnang\nPURSAT Chhlong\nSnuol\nSdok\nKOMPONG\nKOMPONG Kompong Cham\nCHAM\nCHHNANG Phuni Tonle Bet Memot\nGulf   of   Thailand\nKrek\nKoh Kong KOMPONG\nSPEU PHNOM PENH N\nKompong Speu Prey Veng\nKOH  KONG\nTakmau PREY\nVENG\nSre Ambel KANDAL SVAY 0 25 50 75 100\nRIENG\nNational Capital\nKompong\n11o  00'N Provincial Capital Kaaong Angtassom Takeo Trabek Svay Rieng Kilometers 11o  00'N\nCity/Town KAMPOT TAKEO B\nNOathtieorn Ralo Radoad Sihanoukville VealK Raemnhpot Kep TaTnuik Meas assac R.\nSIHANOUKVILLE\nRailway KEP\nRiver Mekong R.\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nSouth  China  Sea\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n7\n-3\n2\n29 H 103 o 00'E 107 o 00'E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Enhancing Education Quality Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s economy is experiencing rapid expansion. In 2006, gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth was estimated at 10.4%, consolidating double-digit growth of the previous 2 \nyears. The upturn is due to stronger industrial production and robust expansion in services and \nconstruction activity. Agricultural production expanded by a stronger than expected 4.4% from \nthe  record  levels  achieved  in  2005.  This  trend  in  strong  economic  growth  is  expected  to \ncontinue in the medium term.  \n \n3.  A rapidly growing urban economy, together with approximately 74.2% of the population \nstill  employed  in  agriculture,  creates  a  dual  challenge  for  the  Government  in  meeting  the \nemerging demand for a qualified, skilled, and competitive work force, while at the same time \nbridging disparities in access to education and meeting its goals of universal primary education. \nTo meet this challenge, the Government is placing increasing emphasis on balancing the needs \nof  more  equitable  access  to  education  by  improving  the  quality  and  reach  of  secondary \neducation. \n \n4.  The National Strategic Development Plan recognizes education as a crucial factor in \ndeveloping the country\u2019s human resources and endorses the Education Strategic Plan (ESP)\u2014a \n5-year rolling plan for developing the education sector. The ESP articulates the vision of the \nMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) to \u201cestablish and develop human resources of \nthe  very  highest  quality  and  ethics  in  order  to  develop  a  knowledge  based society  within \nCambodia.\u201d  The  ESP  defines  MoEYS\u2019  long-term  mission  as  ensuring  that  all  Cambodian \nchildren and youth have equal opportunity to access quality education consistent with the \nConstitution and the Government\u2019s commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights \nof the Child, regardless of social status, geography, ethnicity, religion, language, gender, or \ndisabilities. The ESP highlights three main policies: (i) equitable access to education services, \n(ii) quality and efficiency of education services, and (iii) institutional development and capacity \nbuilding for decentralization. The ESP is supported by an Education Sector Support Program \n(ESSP) which is reviewed annually in consultation with development partners and serves as the \naction plan to achieve the sector goals set out in the ESP. The ESSP identifies the necessary \nprogram activities and priorities in reaching the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals and \nthe goals set out in the Education for All (EFA) national plan. The Government\u2019s Rectangular \nStrategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency includes capacity building and human \nresource development as one of its four pillars, with enhancing the quality of education being \nthe main feature.  \n \n5.  The current education system comprises primary (grades 1\u20136), lower secondary (grades \n7\u20139), and upper secondary (grades 10\u201312). Basic education is defined as grades 1\u20139. Entry to \nupper secondary level is regulated by a national examination at the end of grade 9. Technical \nand vocational education programs run parallel to upper secondary programs and are the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training.  \n ", "2   \n6.  Despite its historical disadvantage, Cambodia has made considerable progress in the \nprovision of education. In 2006\u20132007, the gross enrolment ratio (GER)1 at primary level was \n123% and the net enrolment ratio (NER)2 was 92.1%. This indicates a 13.5% increase against \nan NER of 77.8% in 1997\u20131998. During the same period, the GER for girls at the primary level \nincreased from 81.2% to 119.3%, and the NER for girls at the primary level increased from \n72.4% to 91%. The impressive growth in enrolments at the primary level has led to high rates of \nincrease  in  enrolments  at  the  lower  and  upper  secondary  levels.  Since  1997\u20131998,  lower \nsecondary enrolments have grown by 135% and upper secondary enrolments have grown by \n260%. But, despite the rapidly growing demand for secondary education, the vast majority of \nchildren  of  secondary  school  age  are  still  not  enrolled  in  school.  The  GER  at  the  lower \nsecondary level is 60%, and at the upper secondary level it is 21.2%; the NER at the lower \nsecondary level is 31.3%, and at the upper secondary level it is 11.3%. At the lower secondary \nlevel, the GER for girls is 54.5% and the NER for girls is 33.1%. At the upper secondary level \nthe  GER  for  girls  is  15.3%  and  the  NER  is  9.9%.  Despite  the  rapid  expansion,  overall \nenrolments at the secondary level are low, largely as a consequence of poor geographic access \nto lower secondary schools. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are both \nsupporting  construction  of  lower  secondary  schools  and  together  will  provide  628  lower \nsecondary schools through their ongoing interventions.3 The impact of this on enrolments at the \nlower  secondary  level  will  be  felt  in  the  coming  years.  Meanwhile,  such  low  levels  of \nparticipation  in  secondary  education  are  a  severe  constraint  to  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment. \n7.  Expansion  of  education  has  been  fueled  by  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  and \nextensive support from development partners, but the overall quality and efficiency of education \nremains a serious concern. Expansion of enrolments in primary schools has led to high student-\nteacher ratios. Drop out and repetition rates remain high. Due to low levels of enrolments, \nsecondary education has relatively higher graduation and lower drop out rates. Of the children \nwho enroll in grade 1, only 14.78% finish grade 12 within 12 years. Low enrolment rates at the \nsecondary level, as well as a low percentage of students completing school, is a cause for \nconcern because the figures indicate large numbers of young people outside the school system \nand  therefore  unskilled  and  unemployable.  Across  the  school  system,  schools  have  poor \nphysical infrastructure and inadequate learning materials, laboratories, and libraries. Teachers \nare  poorly  qualified,  inadequately  trained,  and  unmotivated.  Limited  resources  hamper  the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to effect major improvements, and the poor performance of the education \nsystem wastes already scarce resources.  \n \n8.  Given the rapidly expanding national economy and the global trends in demand for \neducation at all levels, the education sector in Cambodia will continue to experience rapid \ngrowth  and  exert  pressure  on  MoEYS\u2019  management  capacity.  The  Project  will  strengthen \ninstitutional and management capacity through a variety of interventions, and target support for \nenhancing the quality of secondary education. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n                                                 \n1  GER refers to pupils enrolled from all age groups. \n2  NER refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group. \n3  ADB. 2004.

The second Education Sector Development Program will provide 400 new lower secondary schools. \nThe Cambodia Education Sector Support Program, supported by the World Bank, will provide 228 new lower \nsecondary schools.  \n ", "    3     \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  An analysis of the performance of the education sector is outlined below and provided in \nmore detail in Appendix 2. \n1.  Access and Equity \n10.  Since 2001, equity of access to basic education has improved. Primary and secondary \nschool enrolment has increased by 30%, and there is greater participation by children from the \npoorest families, ethnic minorities, and by girls. Many additional primary and lower secondary \nclassrooms have been built to improve access. Repetition rates have also fallen in the lower \nprimary grades. However, disparities persist based on gender, ethnicity, geographic location, \nand economic background. At the primary level, the differentials in NER between urban (93.2%) \nand rural (92.2%) areas are not significant. The differences are more marked in remote and \ndisadvantaged areas,4 where the overall NER drops to 73.2%. Mondulkiri (with an NER of \n68.9%) and Ratanakiri (with an NER of 56.9%) have the lowest overall NERs. They also have \nthe highest rates of GER at 202.9% for Mondulkiri and 163.1% for Ratanakiri, indicating overage \nenrolments of 66% for Mondulkiri and 65.1% for Ratanakiri. Surprisingly, Mondulkiri has a high \ntransition rate to lower secondary of 90.4%, while the corresponding figure for Ratanakiri is \n72.6%. \n11.  Rural urban differentials for gender are not significant, with a marginally higher NER in \nrural areas (92.6%) than in urban areas (91.1%). However, in disadvantaged areas, the NER for \ngirls drops to 70.6%. The two above-mentioned provinces, along with Otdar Meanchey, have \nvery high GER for girls at the primary level but among the lowest GER at the lower and upper \nsecondary levels. They also have the lowest NER for girls at all levels of school education. In \nboth provinces, the transition rates for girls (83.0% in Mondulkiri and 83.2% in Ratanakiri) are \nhigher than the national average (78.7%). In fact, among female students, drop out rates reduce \nwith each successive grade completed. The NER of children at secondary education in remote \nand disadvantaged areas is much lower than the national average. Women have the lowest \nrepresentation  in  the  teaching  force  in  the  disadvantaged  areas.  Thus,  while  children  in \ndisadvantaged areas are least likely to have access to schools, a more critical examination of \nstatistics indicates that the children who do obtain access to schooling are likely to use the \nopportunity reasonably well.  \n2.  Quality \na.  Curriculum \n12.  MoEYS  approved  a  policy  in  December  2005  and  master  plan  for  curriculum \ndevelopment for the period 2005\u20132009. Since then, processes for developing and introducing \nnew curricula have been underway; the Pedagogic Research Department (PRD) is responsible \nfor curriculum development, MoEYS has received support from the United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) for review of curriculum for basic education (all subjects for \ngrades 1\u20139), and from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in mathematics and \nthree science subjects at upper secondary level (grades 10\u201312). At the secondary level to date, \nnew curricula have been developed for lower secondary Khmer, mathematics, social studies, \nand sciences, and for upper secondary mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics.  \n                                                 \n4  A disadvantaged area is a location where one of the following conditions applies: poor transport infrastructure, \npopulation density of less than 10 persons per square kilometer, regularly flooded areas and/or areas vulnerable to \nnatural disasters, integrated areas and/or border areas, and areas that have an insufficient number of schools of all \nlevels. \n ", "4   \n13.  Progress in developing curricula in areas that are not supported directly by donors has \nbeen slow due to the lack of technical support to inform and guide the process, as well as the \ncompeting  demands  on  PRD  staff.  Curricula  need  to  be  revised  for  the  traditional  civics \nsubjects, foreign languages (English and French), and for the proposed Elective Vocational \nEducation Program (EVEP) subjects which are being introduced.  \n14.  PRD needs support to strengthen its professional curriculum development capacity. The \ncurrent  phasing  of  introducing  the  new  curriculum  needs  to  be  adjusted  to  accommodate \nseveral dimensions in order to optimize the benefits from support for strengthening institutional \ncapacity.  The  dimensions  include  (i)  curriculum  coherence  across  years,  (ii)  efficient  and \neffective curriculum development, (iii) orientation of schools and teachers to the new curriculum, \n(iv) minimizing the disruption to students and teachers during introduction of the new curriculum, \n(v) implications for preparing learning materials to support the new curriculum, (vi) integration of \nthe new curriculum with the preservice teacher training curriculum as well as with student \nexamination and assessment, and (vii) a schedule for curriculum reviews. \nb.  Assessment \n15.  The assessment and examination system has benefited from support from the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID). However, the system still needs significant \nstrengthening since it is not fully standards-based and lacks coherence. The Government is \ndesigning assessment against curriculum standards for grades 3, 6, and 9. To complete this \nsystem, curriculum standards (and also grade criteria) need to be developed for grade 12. A \nclear relationship between school-based assessment in grades 1 and 2 and assessment of \ncurriculum standards in grade 3 (and for subsequent grades up to grade 9) needs to be \nestablished so that there is coherent reporting on student progress. The new system of national \nassessments (standardized tests at grades 3, 6, and 9 in Khmer and mathematics, applied to a \nsample of the student population to assess learning achievement) needs to be supported in \napplying the curriculum standards by using similar items to those used in schools to assess \nthese curriculum standards. Complementarities need to be established between school-based \nassessment and the current examination system. The Examinations Office lacks capacity to \nundertake these reforms and needs a phased strengthening with the introduction of information \nand  communication  technology  (ICT)-led  improvements  for  management  of  assessment, \nadministration, and record keeping.  \nc.  Textbooks and Learning Materials \n16.  MoEYS\u2019 stated policy is to ensure adequate provision of core instructional materials  and \nto encourage the process of widening the choice and therefore the quality in the provision of \ntextbooks by opening the textbook market to supply by multiple publishers. This is expected to \nallow more flexibility in the purchase of core learning materials at the school level with quality \nand cost benefits for MoEYS. In practice, this has not happened because copyright is vested in \nthe Publishing and Distribution House (PDH) and pricing issues have kept other publishers out \nof the textbook publishing business. Centralized procurement also contributes to serious delays \nin provision of textbooks. Lack of textbooks is a major obstacle to student learning. Inputs for \nstrengthening  quality  of  education  can  only  have  impact  if  the  complex  issues  relating  to \nprovision of textbooks are resolved as a matter of the highest priority.  \n17.  PRD  is  responsible  for  putting  textbook  writing  and  production  out  to  tender  and \nsupporting interested publishers with specifications, information, and guidance to enable them \nto develop material suitable for submission to the MoEYS textbook approval process. PRD is \n ", "    5     \nalso responsible for ensuring that learning materials are developed on time and in line with \ncurriculum requirements. PRD will play a key role in implementing MoEYS\u2019 policy on textbook \ndevelopment and needs support to be able to do this effectively.   \nd.  Teacher Quality \n18.  The low quality of teaching is a major reason for the poor quality of education. Low \nentry-level qualifications and inadequate training (or no training at all) are the most basic causes \nof  poor  teaching  quality.  Of  the  approximately  25,520  teachers  at  the  lower  and  upper \nsecondary level, about 14,400 are considered underqualified. Poor motivation of both teachers \nand trainers, and inadequate support and supervision, also contribute to poor teaching quality. \nThe  following  interventions  are  considered  necessary  for  improving  the  quality  of  teacher \ntraining and professional development: (i) strengthening the capacity of teacher training colleges \n(TTCs) to improve teacher skills and competencies; (ii) strengthening in-service teacher training \nto improve the quality of classroom teaching; and (iii) a strategy for professional development \nthat addresses, among other issues, a financial and nonfinancial incentive structure.  \n \n19.  The ESSP prioritizes a staff development program for TTCs and a responsive preservice \nand in-service teacher training program to enhance the capacity of teachers and trainers. These \nprograms are linked to the introduction of teacher standards, teacher training standards, and \nimproved systems of performance monitoring. The ESSP proposes a formal certification system \nas a foundation for the development of the national teacher education system. To achieve this, \ncriteria and procedures need to be developed for assessing competencies and certification of \ncourses that teachers and trainers attend. A training needs-analysis for teachers has identified \nthe following competencies that need strengthening: (i) institutional management skills, (ii) the \nability to develop and use ICT multimedia, (iii) English language skills, and (iv) upgrading of \nunderqualified teachers in secondary schools. All teacher training programs need to be planned \nand coordinated to ensure that (i) duplication with other development initiatives is avoided, (ii) \nfuture planned activities complement and strengthen current interventions, and (iii) the system \nhas the capacity to absorb the training activities on the scale planned. Since teacher salaries \nconsume a large percentage of the budget for education, improvements in teacher quality will \nsignificantly improve resource efficiencies. \n \ne.  Institutional Capacity \n20.  Weak functional capacity in the education system continues to be a barrier to achieving \nthe goal of universal primary education and enhancing education quality. MoEYS has been \noverstretched in its administrative, planning, and policy formulation functions. Development \npartners have provided support for building capacity, but this support has been constrained by \ninadequate staff development, poor facilities, and lack of effective leadership. Besides, rapidly \nexpanding primary education, supported by the national and international focus on universal \nprimary education, has absorbed much of the resources. Lower secondary education, with its \ninclusion  in  basic  education,  is  beginning  to  receive  attention;  secondary  education  has \nremained a neglected subsector. TTCs have received only sporadic support and lack adequate \nfacilities such as libraries and laboratories. These weaknesses have resulted in weak and \ninefficient implementation of policies, and inadequate capacity for meeting the demands for \nmanagement and teacher training.  \n \n21.  Management information systems (MISs) remain weak in MoEYS. Mechanisms for data \ngathering and manipulation are minimal at the point of collection. MISs often do not have the \ncapacity to interconnect with one another, not only because the basic data sets are incompatible \n ", "6   \nbut also because the staff lack the analytical skills. Where they exist, basic data sets are held \nwithin systems which are associated with a specific entry. Currently MoEYS has a number of \ninformation systems: the education MIS, centered in the MoEYS Department of Planning; the \nfinancial MIS in the Department of Finance, and a human resources MIS in the Department of \nPersonnel. The education MIS system does not interrelate with either the human resources or \nfinancial MIS. The human resources MIS is supported by the United Nations Children's Fund \n(UNICEF) and the European Union, and the education MIS is supported by UNICEF and the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Other systems that already \nexist or are planned relate to school construction, nonformal education, higher education, and \nthe Department of Information and ASEAN Affairs. \n  \nf.  Financing for Education \n22.  Education\u2019s share of the national budget has increased from 13.6% in 2000 to an \nexpected 19.2% in 2007. During the same period, allocations to education in absolute terms \nincreased from KR183.2 billion to KR546 billion. Education expenditures as a percentage of \nGDP increased from 1.2% in 2000 to 1.93% in 2007. Despite the increases, the share of \neducation in national spending remains low compared with other developing countries.  \n \n23.  The education sector receives substantial financing from development partners. During \nthe period 2005\u20132010, committed external funding is estimated at $327.6 million, without taking \ninto account any further commitments that may be made by development partners. A large \nnumber  of  donors  support  the  education  sector  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  European \nCommission and the United Nations agencies being the biggest donors. Resource requirements \nto successfully achieve the objectives set out in the ESP 2006\u20132010 are estimated at $864 \nmillion. Despite projections for robust economic growth, the Government will not be able to meet \nthese resource requirements and will continue to depend on external assistance to augment \nresources.  \n \n3.  Government Objectives and Strategic Policies \n24.  The Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency \nstates  that  the  government  will  continue  to  increase  budget  expenditures,  and  mobilize \nincreased  international  assistance  to  (i)  provide  incentives  for  teachers;  (ii)  assure  quality \ninstruction; (iii) provide educational materials, equipment, libraries, and laboratories; (iv) build \ndormitories for students, especially female students; (v) continue to reform curricula and training \nprograms; (vi) provide scholarships to poor students; (vii) promote informal education programs; \n(viii) finance construction of schools in rural areas; and (ix) support school operating costs. \n25.  The Government\u2019s various aspirational goals for expansion of education opportunities \nare reflected in the ESP, which was the first step towards adopting a sectorwide strategy for \neducation development. The ESSP outlines how strategies laid out by the ESP will be put into \npractice.  It emphasizes strengthening appropriate MoEYS departments at central and provincial \nlevels,  including  delegation  of  responsibilities  to  districts,  clusters  and/or  communes,  and \nschools. The Government\u2019s Framework for Decentralization and Deconcentration reinforces the \ndistribution of responsibilities and resources to provincial and municipal levels. The Government \nalso accords the highest priority to the EFA national plan.  \n26.  In 2006, the Council of Ministers approved the draft Education Law which has been \nsubmitted  to  the  National  Assembly  for  ratification.  Under  the  Education  Law,  a  National \nCouncil for Education will be established to promote the development of the education \n ", "    7     \nsector. MoEYS has also prepared the Policy and Strategies on ICT in Education (2004), the \nGender  Mainstreaming  Strategy  in  Education  (2006\u20132010),  and  the  Policy  for  Curriculum \n(2005\u20132009), and provided guidelines for the integration of these policies into the broader \nprocess of education reform.  \n4.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n27.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  education  sector  in  Cambodia  has  evolved  to  emphasize \nstrengthening the investments made during past projects and building upon them to move \ntowards more integrated support for the education sector. Through the first Education Sector \nDevelopment Program (ESDP I),5 approved in 1999, ADB provided program support for (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s  priority  action  program,  (ii)  expanding  access  to  primary  education,  and  (iii) \ncurriculum and textbook development. The second Education Sector Development Program \n(ESDP II),6 approved in 2004, continued the support for policy reforms but shifted support for \nexpanding access to lower secondary education through school facilities development. The \nESDP II also provides for construction of 24 new upper secondary schools and 25 model upper \nsecondary  schools.  It  also  included  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  planning  for  secondary \neducation development.7 ADB has also supported policy reform, governance, and regulatory \nreform for decentralization of education through an advisory TA project8 linked to the second \neducation program. ADB provided assistance for expanding access to primary education for \nchildren from remote and disadvantaged areas and for upgrading primary schools that do not \noffer a full 5-year cycle of primary schooling. ADB\u2019s support to the education sector has been \nfully consistent with Government priorities as enunciated in the ESP. The proposed Project will \nprovide much-needed support for systemwide strengthening of institutional capacity for quality \neducation. It will also expand and strengthen secondary education, which is now recognized as \nkey to national economic development.  \n \n5.  External Assistance to Education  \n28.  Development agencies provide substantial support to the education sector in Cambodia. \nThe World Bank and ADB are the two major funding agencies and, from 2002 to 2007, will \ntogether account for 42% of the total external funding for education. Other agencies supporting \neducation include the European Commission, JICA, Sida, the United Nations Populations Fund \n(UNFPA), UNICEF, and USAID. The World Bank\u2019s support has been targeted at primary and \nlower secondary education. The European Commission has provided budgetary support with \ntechnical  assistance  to  strengthen  public  financial  management.  USAID  has  supported \ncurriculum development at the primary level. JICA support has targeted teacher training and \ncurriculum development for science and mathematics at the secondary level.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

External assistance to the sector is channeled within the ESP framework. Donors have \nused different modalities to provide support\u2014ADB has used sector development programs, the \nWorld  Bank  has  used  the  project  modality,  and  the  European  Commission  has  provided \nbudgetary support. There are no large multidonor cofinanced projects in the education sector in \nCambodia. The donor coordination mechanism has strengthened over the years but modalities \nof assistance have been determined by the extensive needs of the sector and constrained by \nboth donor and government capacity. This project has been designed to target interventions at \nspecific areas that need strengthening in order to improve the quality of learning outcomes. The \nproject is fully consistent with the Government\u2019s emphasis on enhancing the quality of school \neducation and addresses key areas highlighted in the ESP and ESSP. The links with the ESSP \nare highlighted in Supplementary Appendix B. The Project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy  program  for  Cambodia,9 which  recognizes  that  quality  of  education  needs  to  be \nimproved at all levels. An analysis of external assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned \n30.  Valuable lessons have been drawn from projects and programs that have supported the \neducation sector in the past. The generic lessons include that (i) rapid expansion of access to \nprimary schooling is putting great pressure on secondary education, which needs attention; (ii) \nemphasis on expansion needs to be matched by emphasis on quality; (iii) an organizational \nframework for in-service teacher training which is linked to the preservice TTCs is needed; (iv) \nprovision of facilities needs careful planning in order to ensure optimum utilization of resources; \n(v) institution building needs flexible inputs and a thorough analysis of institutional needs; (vi) \nprofessional  development  activities  must  be  specific  in  terms  of  intended  outputs, \ncompetencies,  certification,  and  career  development  opportunities;  (vii)  adequate  technical \nassistance needs to be provided for strengthening capacity; and (viii) experts need to work \nclosely  with  counterparts  for  knowledge  and  skills  transfer  and  reduce  dependency \n(Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n31.  Despite the extensive assistance to the sector, the scope of the education reforms has \nexceeded the capacity of MoEYS. Institutional and systemic weaknesses have not received \nadequate  attention,  and  the  capacity  of  the  education  system  to  absorb  new  concepts  is \nconstrained by weak capacity. Experience from ADB-supported projects indicates that (i) due to \ncapacity constraints, the policy and program reforms had to be supported by diverting technical \nassistance provided for other activities, (ii) many recommendations of the technical assistance \nprovided under the ESDP I could not be implemented due to systemic weaknesses, and (iii) \nsupport for strengthening capacity needs to be carefully designed to ensure longer-term benefits \nto the system.  \n  \n32.  The preparation of the Project has been guided by the Government\u2019s education policies, \nin-depth subsector analysis, and the lessons learned from experience. The Project places \nsignificant emphasis on (i) policy coherence, (ii) building management and institutional capacity, \nand (iii) strengthening the quality and reach of secondary education. The Project provides \nadequate  technical  assistance  to  support  all  proposed  activities  to  ensure  that  they  are \nimplemented satisfactorily. It also proposes an implementation structure comprising technical \nunits for each component to promote ownership and encourage skills transfer and capacity \nbuilding through partnership with technical experts.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

The impact of the Project will be an increased number of better-educated and skilled \npeople from all sections of Cambodia\u2019s population. The Project aims to strengthen the quality of \nschool  education  by  carefully  targeting  support  for  (i)  education  system  management  and \ndevelopment,  (ii)  professional  development  of  teachers,  and  (iii)  strengthening  secondary \neducation. A key underlying aspect of all proposed activities is strengthening the capacity of \ninstitutions  and  agencies  responsible  for  delivery  of  quality  education.  This  includes  (i) \nexamining  the  capacity  of  effectiveness  of  MoEYS\u2019  organizational  structure,  (ii)  supporting \ncapacity building of NIE and TTCs, and (iii) strengthening and integrating the MISs. The Project \nwill  provide  extensive  support  for  improving  teacher  quality  and  management,  including \nupgrading facilities of the TTCs and enhancing competencies of teacher trainers. The quality of \nsecondary education will be strengthened through (i) improved secondary school management; \n(ii) upgraded facilities including libraries and science and ICT laboratories; (iii) provision of \ntextbooks; and (iv) improved secondary school curriculum, assessment, and examinations. \n \n34.  The Project outcome will be improved quality and equity of education in Cambodia with \nstronger  education  management  systems,  improved  teacher  competencies,  and  effective \nsecondary education.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n35.  The Project outputs and supporting activities are detailed below.   \n \n1.  Education System Management and Development \n36.  The objective of this component is to strengthen institutional capacity of MoEYS for more \nefficient management and delivery of education services. This will be achieved through the \nfollowing actions. \n \n37.  Dissemination of the Education Law and Gender Mainstreaming Policy. The Project \nwill support dissemination of the law upon its adoption by the National Assembly through \ndistribution of printed copies to schools, district and provincial offices, and other stakeholders. \nMaterials designed for display in schools and other public places will be distributed to create \nwider awareness of the provisions of the law. A national workshop will be conducted for senior \nnational and provincial officials of MoEYS and other key ministries to familiarize them with the \nprovisions of the education law. The Project will also support dissemination of MoEYS\u2019 Gender \nMainstreaming Policy to schools and MoEYS offices and institutions at the district, provincial, \nand national level.   \n \n38.  Policy Framework for Teacher Education and Teacher Management. The Project \nwill assist MoEYS to prepare a policy framework that integrates policies and strategies related \nto  teacher  recruitment,  deployment,  qualifications,  professional  development,  and  career \ngrowth,  and  encompasses  five  strategic  areas:  (i)  management  of  the  teacher  education \nsystem,  (ii)  teacher  education  methodology,  (iii)  a  system  of  continuing  professional \ndevelopment,  (iv)  teacher  recruitment  and  retention,  and  (v)  financial  and  nonfinancial \nincentives for teachers. \n \n \n ", "10   \n39.  Strengthening the National Institute of Education. The Project will support NIE to \nexamine  different  institutional  models  and  identify  a  suitable  model  for  its  own  long-term \ninstitutional growth so that future support can be targeted in a way that develops NIE\u2019s capability \nto provide leadership on issues of education quality. The Project will also support NIE to (i) \ndevelop  an  institutional  development  plan  with  a  clear  vision  for  the  next  10  years,  (ii) \nstrengthen education research capacity, (iii) enhance staff professional capacity, (iv) establish a \nmultimedia  center,  (v)  develop  training  programs  for  management  and  planning,  and  (vi) \nimplement outreach activities for upper secondary teachers. \n \n40.  Review of the Roles and Functions of MoEYS at the Central, Provincial, District, \nand School Levels. The proposed review will consider MoEYS\u2019 changing role resulting from \nthe  implementation  of  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  strategy.  The  review  will \nconsider the management, educational, and administrative functions of MoEYS, and the internal \nstructure of the departments to address problems of coordination, communication, overlap, and \nlinkages. The review will include the organization and functions of the provincial and district \noffices and TTCs, and will be supported by recommendations for rationalizing the organizational \nstructures.  \n \n41.  Strengthening  Information  Systems. A task force will be formed to develop clear \nguidelines for the use of information for education planning and to develop an implementation \nplan to fully integrate the education, human resources, and finance MISs. The Project will \nsupport  strengthening  statistical  analysis,  general  performance  and  quality  indicators,  and \nqualitative reporting for the education MIS. The Project will ensure that the finance MIS is \ncompatible with the Ministry of Economy and Finance system. The human resources MIS will be \nsupported  through  upgrade  of  equipment  and  materials.  Information,  education,  and \ncommunication  capacity  at  the  Department  of  Information  and  ASEAN  Affairs  will  be \nstrengthened to enable it to play a coordinating role in the dissemination of information. \n \n42.  Establishing Monitoring and Quality Assurance Systems. The Project will assist \nMoEYS to define the roles and responsibilities of its key departments in monitoring and quality \nassurance activities of the inspectorate general, and departments of Teacher Training, Primary, \nand Secondary Education. The self-assessment system for schools will be expanded to include \nlower  secondary  and  upper  secondary  schools.  A  similar  self-assessment  system  will  be \nintroduced in the TTCs. Institutional and management capacity will be strengthened to improve \nthe monitoring and quality assurance systems by linking them to the identification of training \nneeds. The professional competencies of secondary school inspectors will be strengthened. \nFunctions and performance of the Committee on Continuous Teacher Development will be \nreviewed with the objective of strengthening its role in quality assurance. Teacher standards will \nbe linked to the identification of teacher professional development needs. Teacher quality will be \nmonitored using teacher profiles10 and school self-assessment tools. \n \n43.  Enhancing Capacity of the Pedagogic Research Department and the Education \nMaterials Approval Board. The Project will support PRD to develop a system to manage the \nprocess of textbook development in accordance with MoEYS policies. PRD will draw up detailed \nprocurement  briefs  to  enable  MoEYS  to  invite  private  publishers  to  develop  books  to  the \nrequired  specifications.  PRD  will  be  the  executing  body  of  the  existing  Prequalification, \nEvaluation and Award of Contract Committee and Education Materials Approval Board, which \nwill ensure transparency and quality in book selection.  \n                                                 \n10 Complementary to the development of teacher profiles for primary and lower secondary levels, profiles for upper \nsecondary teachers will be developed under the Project as part of secondary school management development.  \n ", "    11     \n44.  Under  MoEYS\u2019  policy  on  textbook  development,  PRD  will  have  a  continuing  direct \nrelationship with the textbook drafting and approval process, and in managing and guiding \ntextbook developers. The Project will support capacity building of PRD by enabling staff to \ndevelop  necessary  skills  to  draft  procurement  documents,  write  specimen  materials,  and \ncommission books to be supplied by the private sector to strict specifications, and to organize \ntransparent book evaluation at all levels.  \n2.  Professional Development of Teachers \n45.  The objective of this component is to strengthen teacher competencies. This will be \naccomplished through the following actions.   \n46.  Enhancing Management Capacity of Teacher Training Institutions. The Project will \nsupport several measures to strengthen TTCs. A framework of teacher training standards linked \nto  the  development  of  a  teacher  education  policy  will  be  developed.  The  teacher  training \nstandards will provide a benchmark for performance monitoring of quality in teacher training. \nThe  institutional  capacity  of  NIE  and  TTCs  will  be  strengthened  through  a  management \nleadership training program for directors and deputy directors of these institutions to implement \n(i) quality standards, (ii) institutional improvement planning, (iii) curriculum review procedures, \nand (iv) performance monitoring of quality in teacher training. This leadership training course will \nalso include building professional research capacity within each faculty.  \n47.  Strengthening  In-Service  Teacher  Training  Curriculum  and  Performance \nMonitoring. Systematic procedures will be introduced to incorporate changes to the school \ncurriculum into the preservice teacher training program and to ensure that appropriate teaching \nand learning methodology is used in the delivery of the curriculum. The Teacher Training \nDepartment (TTD) will be involved in the review of in-service teacher training programs to \nensure consistency in content and methodology. The revised teacher training curriculum will \ninclude action research as a training and professional development methodology. The quality of \nteacher training programs will be further enhanced by implementing an improved system of \nteacher  training  performance  monitoring,  including  a  review  of  the  methods  used  in  the \nassessment of student teacher competencies, and teacher trainer competencies. The quality of \nteacher training programs will be evaluated against teacher training standards.  \n48.  Upgrading Facilities of TTCs. Facilities of NIE and all TTCs11 will be improved through \nneeds-based construction and rehabilitation of buildings, and provision of learning facilities \nand/or materials. An assessment of existing and planned physical facilities will be undertaken to \nidentify the requirement of each TTC. Learning centers comprising a library and multimedia \ncenter, a computer lab, and a science laboratory will be provided or upgraded in all 26 TTCs.12 \nTeacher trainers and trainee teachers will be provided resources to develop skills in practical \nteaching and learning methodologies and to undertake professional research studies. \n49.  Expanding Access to Teacher Training Opportunities. To increase participation of \nstudents, particularly girls, from remote and disadvantaged areas in the teaching profession at \nthe secondary level, 500 scholarships will be provided for teacher trainees at NIE and regional \n                                                 \n11  The Government proposes to merge provincial and regional TTCs so the term TTC is being used to cover all levels \nof TTCs. \n12  The Government of Japan proposes to provide a building for science laboratories in the six regional TTCs. ADB \nproject support will complement this with provision of equipment. This excludes the four resource centers provided \nunder the second Education Sector Development Program. \n ", "12   \nTTCs.13 Teaching instructional materials in NIE and regional TTCs will be revised to include \nperspectives of gender equality. Facilities of TTCs will be improved to provide a safe and secure \nenvironment for female teachers and teacher trainees.  \n50.  Improving Skills and Competencies of Teacher Trainers in the TTCs. Skills and \ncompetencies of teacher trainers in the preservice teacher training program will be improved \nbased  on  a  comprehensive  training  needs  analysis.  The  analysis  will  be  used  to  develop \ntraining programs corresponding to trainer competency criteria described in the teacher training \nstandards and in the teacher standards. Training programs to enhance training skills through (i) \na training-of-trainers course, (ii) multimedia instructional materials, (iii) training for use of ICT in \nthe classroom, and (iv) training in basic English competency, have been included based on the \nskills and competencies identified as priority areas for the professional development of teacher \ntrainers. The research capacity of teacher trainers will be enhanced through an action research \ninitiative linked to an NIE research program and to the inclusion of action research in the revised \nteacher training methodology.  \n51.  Improving Teaching Skills and Competencies of Secondary Teachers. A 5-year \nteacher training plan will be developed to coordinate all teacher training activities planned during \nthe Project. A baseline study of teacher training needs linked to teacher competencies and \nteacher standards will be undertaken. The study will provide information on levels of teacher \nqualification required to enable prioritization of training to target groups and assist in identifying \nthe most disadvantaged districts in terms of the number of underqualified teachers and lower \nthan average number of female teachers. It will also provide information to make it possible to \nquantify the competency levels of teachers in order to determine their English language and ICT \ntraining needs. \n52.  Upgrade  Competencies  of  Underqualified  Teachers.  Training  programs  will  be \ndeveloped and delivered to upgrade the competencies of an estimated 14,400 underqualified \nsecondary school teachers using (i) multimedia instructional materials wherever possible, (ii) a \nface-to-face workshop module, and (iii) school-based practical assignments such as action \nresearch. The training of school-based technical group leaders will be designed to provide \nongoing support for underqualified teachers through a system of mentoring.  \n53.  Strengthening  English  Language,  Science,  and  ICT  Competencies.  A  training \nprogram will be developed to enhance the English language skills of upper secondary school \nteachers using a decentralized school-based model. The English language course will be based \non a course book, interactive CD, and audio cassette developed in the first year of the project, \nand will be taught by the English-language teacher in the school in classes held for 2 hours per \nweek over a 2-year period. A program similar to this will also be developed to train upper \nsecondary school teachers in teaching science, ICT, and in the use of multimedia instructional \nmaterials. \n54.  Developing Multimedia Modality for Teacher Education. Multimedia modalities for \nteacher  education  will  be  developed,  initially  through  TTD.  A  comprehensive  plan  will  be \ndeveloped  for  the  expansion  of  facilities  and  the  development  of  technical  capacity  within \nrelevant departments. The plan will define the links and responsibilities which will be necessary \nbetween TTD, PRD, and Information and ASEAN Affairs Department. The multimedia modality \nfor teacher education will support the delivery of some training activities through the use of \n                                                 \n13  Females will comprise 60% of the beneficiaries under the total number of scholarships for teacher training and for \nupper secondary level. This percentage is recommended for each category but in case it cannot be met in one or \nother category due to a lack of eligible candidates, it will be compensated for in the second category.    \n ", "    13     \ninteractive computer-based learning materials. The disparity in access to multimedia resources \nacross  the  country  will  be  addressed  through  the  upgrade  of  facilities  and  by  introducing \nmultimedia modalities in teacher training programs.  \n55.  The  technical  capacity  of  teacher  trainers  and  curriculum  developers  will  be \nstrengthened for developing multimedia instructional materials so that they are aware of the \npotential of multimedia and the ways in which curriculum materials can be prepared. On-the-job \ntraining will provide the opportunity for trainers to develop instructional materials for use in \nselected courses. In parallel with the development of instructional materials it is necessary to \ndevelop  and  implement  corresponding  systems  of  academic  and  administrative  support, \nincluding (i) distribution of materials, (ii) completion of assignments, (iii) record keeping, and (iv) \nstudent support. The effectiveness of multimedia components in teacher training programs for \nimproving quality and contributing towards meeting the challenge of outreach to the more \nremote and disadvantaged areas where access to teacher training opportunities is limited will be \nmonitored.  \n3.  Strengthening Secondary Education \n56.  The objective of this component is to strengthen secondary education. This will be \nachieved through the following actions. \n57.  Developing a Secondary Education Development Plan. Under the second Education \nSector Development Program, a secondary education development plan is being prepared \nfocusing on requirements for secondary education based on enrolment projections. The Project \nwill support preparation of a complementary volume of the secondary education development \nplan focusing on quality aspects of secondary education development.  \n58.  Strengthening  School  Networking  and  Management.  A network, centered on 36 \nsecondary schools to be developed as resource schools, will be established early in the Project \nto provide support to secondary schools within their catchment areas. The network will be used \nto strengthen school management, to introduce school improvement planning, and to help \ndevelop and sustain teacher competencies through professional development and mentoring \nactivities. A school leadership training program for upper secondary school directors will include \na module on school improvement planning linked to the school self-assessment model. It will \nalso  focus  on  (i)  facility  and  resource  management,  (ii)  performance  monitoring  and \nachievement  of  minimum  quality  standards,  (iii)  school-based  support  for  the  professional \ndevelopment of teachers including mentoring for underqualified teachers, and (iv) school-based \ninduction programs for newly qualified teachers. The training will also include optimal use of \ntextbooks and other instructional materials, including ICT and multimedia learning resources, on \n(i) gender sensitization and principles of gender mainstreaming, (ii) equitable access to learning \nopportunities for all children, (iii) student retention, (iv) student assessment, and (v) career guidance.  \n59.  The skills and competencies of school and network-based technical group leaders will \nbe enhanced through a training-of-trainers program. The training program will have a school-\nbased focus. Part of the training activities will be undertaken by the participants in their schools \nthrough practical application of new skills and knowledge, using methodologies such as action \nresearch and peer evaluation.   \n60.  Increasing Access for Girls and Children from Remote and Disadvantaged Areas. \nTo reduce gender disparities and inequity in access to secondary education for children from \nremote and disadvantaged areas, merit-based scholarships will be provided to 4,000 students, \n ", "14   \nparticularly girls,  from  remote  and  disadvantaged  areas  to  enable  them  to  enroll  in  upper \nsecondary schools.   \n61.  Upgrading Secondary School Facilities including ICT, Laboratories, and Libraries. \nLearning centers will be provided at the 36 resource schools. The learning centers will include \nscience  and  ICT  laboratories,  and  libraries.  To  cover  operations  and  maintenance  costs, \nbusiness plans will be developed to allow the ICT facilities to be used as a community resource. \nAll remaining secondary schools will receive equipment, learning materials, and library books.  \n62.  Developing Curriculum in Priority Areas for Use in Secondary Schools. The PRD \nwill be supported to develop the lower secondary and upper secondary curricula in subjects that \nhave thus far not been revised. This includes curricula for EVEP, guidelines for development of \nthe  local  life-skills  program,  and  the  development  of  grade  12  curriculum  standards.  The \npreservice and in-service teacher training curriculum will be strengthened to reflect the changes \nin the school curriculum training content and methods. The Project will support dissemination of \nthe  curriculum  items  to  schools  and  across  the  education  system  in  order  to  ensure  that \nteachers, teacher trainers, and education managers fully understand the requirements and \nphilosophy of the new curricula. The project will also support development of PRD capacity to \ncommission,  manage,  and  evaluate  textbook  and  instructional  materials  development  by \npublishers and media producers, and strengthen the ICT capacity of PRD. \n63.  Provision of Textbooks and Teacher Guides to All Upper Secondary Schools. The \nnew  curriculum  is  expected  to  be  phased  in  from  the  academic  year  2008\u20132009.  The \ndevelopment and procurement of new books will take a couple of years. In the interim, the \nshortage of textbooks at upper secondary level will be solved by providing the current textbooks \nand teachers\u2019 manuals needed to bring the ratio of books to pupils to 1:2. Current textbooks and \nteacher's manuals will be procured from PDH through a negotiated direct-purchasing agreement \nto enable the books to be in the schools as early as possible in the 2008\u20132009 school year. The \nProject  will  assist  MoEYS,  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  to \ncomprehensively  review  the  current  textbook  development  and  procurement  policies,  and \nprepare guidelines for implementing the policies to ensure provision of quality textbooks in a \ntimely manner.  \n64.  Strengthening  Assessment  of  Student  Achievement  in  Secondary  Education. \nCurriculum standards have been developed at grades 3, 6, and 9 and national assessments \n(standardized tests) in Khmer and mathematics will be conducted at these grade levels. These \nare  important  steps  towards  a  national  system  of  standards-based  assessment  which  will \nprovide a basis for teachers and students to measure student achievement and for evaluating \neducation quality at national, provincial, and school level. \n65.  A  national  assessment  policy  will  be  developed  for  a  standards-based  national \nassessment  and  examinations  system.  The  policy  will  (i)  establish  a  coherent  relationship \nbetween different types of assessment, (ii) provide for quality assurance of assessment in \nschools, (iii) ensure equity and access, (iv) define the role of ICT, and (v) set out a strategy for \nthe phased strengthening of the Examinations Office, with a view to it eventually becoming an \nindependent body. The strengthening of the Examinations Office will include the enhancement \nof its capacity to use ICT for assessment administration and record keeping. \n66.  Guidelines and exemplar assessment instruments and examination questions will be \ndeveloped and used as a basis for (i) training Examinations Office staff and item writers to set \nand mark standards-based examinations, (ii) secondary teachers to implement standards-based \n ", "    15     \nassessment in schools, and (iii) PRD staff to monitor and evaluate standards-based assessment \nimplementation.  \nC.  Special Features \n67.  The Project is the first intervention to provide inputs for comprehensive capacity building \nand institutional strengthening to enhance quality of education across the school sector in \nCambodia. It is also the first intervention to support improvements in quality of secondary \neducation. In addition to this, the Project aims to integrate ICT, capacity building, and broad \ninterventions related to gender mainstreaming into all project activities.   \n \n68.  Capacity  Building.  The  Project  incorporates  an  appropriate  mix  of  processes  and \nactivities to align capacity building of individuals to organizational outcomes and priorities. Three \nkey  elements  have  been  considered:  (i)  human  capacity  development,  (ii)  institutional \nstrengthening and development of information flows, and (iii) establishing networks. The Project \ntargets  capacity  building  at  the  national,  provincial,  district,  and  school  level  through \ncomprehensive and innovative strategies. The resource schools and their role in providing \nongoing  support  and  mentoring  to  teachers  through  refresher  workshops  conducted  by \ndesignated  technical  group  leaders  will  strengthen  quality  while  compensating  for  lack  of \nconventional in-service training due to resource constraints. The resource schools will provide \nsupport for improving teacher competencies in science, English, and ICT in secondary schools \nwithin their respective catchment area. The Project will strengthen school management and \nplanning  through  leadership  training  for  upper  secondary  school  directors  and  district  and \nprovincial officials.  \n \n69.  Information and Communication Technology. The Project supports wide-ranging use \nof  ICT  to  strengthen  quality  and  efficiency  including  (i)  education  MIS  developments,  (ii) \nincorporating ICT in teacher training curriculum, (iii) for teacher trainers, and (iv) for education \nadministrators in using these facilities. The Project pioneers the introduction of ICT in all TTCs \nand in the resource schools. ICT is introduced both as a means to improve planning and \nmanagement functions as well as to enhance Cambodia\u2019s competitiveness by reducing the \ntechnology gap through increased student exposure to ICT alongside curriculum development \nand  teacher  training.  Elements  necessary  for  an  effective  ICT  development  strategy  are \ncohesively introduced, e.g., training matches provision and vice versa, equipment provision is \nplanned  with  infrastructure  developments,  and  training  in  new  pedagogies  relates  to  ICT \nprovision. The Project has taken into account the infrastructure constraints in order to ensure \nthat the ICT inputs are sustainable.  \n \n70.  Gender Mainstreaming. The Project will disseminate MoEYS\u2019 Gender Mainstreaming \nPolicy and bring principles of gender equity into all its activities\u2014the training of teacher trainers, \npreservice curriculum for teacher training, as well as management training for school directors \nand district and provincial officials. The Project also provides for facilities in TTCs and schools to \nbe safe and secure for females. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n4 and a gender action plan is in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n71.  The project investment cost is estimated at $33.38 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, taxes, and duties (Table 1). The grant proceeds will be used to finance \n(i) civil works; (ii) procurement of books and instructional materials, vehicles, equipment, and \nfurniture; (iii) scholarships; (iv) consulting services; and (v) training, workshops, and technical \n ", "16   \nmeetings.

Implementation Arrangements \n73.  Project Management. MoEYS will be the executing agency (EA) and will have overall \nresponsibility for project implementation. A project steering committee, chaired by a secretary of \nstate, will provide overall guidance to the Project and monitor its activities and outputs. Its \nmembership will include representatives from the departments of Planning, Teacher Training, \nGeneral Secondary Education, and Pedagogical Research, NIE, and from the ministries of \nEconomy and Finance, Women's Affairs, and Planning. \n  \n74.  The director general of General Education will serve as the project director and will be \nsupported by a deputy project director, five staff,14 and four support staff appointed by MoEYS. \n                                                 \n14  The project staff will have expertise in the following fields: administration, finance, accounting, planning and \nprocurement, and monitoring. \n ", "    17     \nThe project staff will be located within the Directorate of General Education. The project director \nwill be a member of the project steering committee and will report to it directly.  \n75.  Three technical units will be established to guide and coordinate implementation of \ncomponent-specific activities. The implementation of specific activities will be the responsibility \nof  the  departments  under  whose  authority  the  activities  fall.  The  technical  units  will  have \nrepresentation from implementing departments, including a member of the gender working \ngroup, to ensure mainstreaming of gender aspects of different activities, and two staff. The \ntechnical units will report to the project director who will ensure coordination and supervision of \nthe technical units.  \n76.  Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over a 6-year period. The \nProject  will  begin  in  2008  and  be  completed  in  2014.  The  government  has  assured  that \nadequate budgetary provision for the Project will be included in the FY2008 budget. A detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n77.  Procurement. All ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The project director, \nassisted by the project staff, will be responsible for all procurement. The indicative procurement \npackages are outlined in Appendix 8.  \n78.  Supply contracts for goods estimated at $100,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles and \ncomputers (except in the case of textbooks and instructional materials) of less than $100,000 \nbut more than $20,000 will follow national competitive bidding procedures. Minor items costing \nless than $20,000 but more than $5,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase with \nadvertising, and items costing less than $5,000 may be procured by direct purchase without \nadvertising. Supply contracts for textbooks and instructional materials may be awarded to PDH \non the basis of direct purchase.15 Details of procurement packages and technical specifications \nmust be submitted for the Ministry of Economy and Finance and ADB for approval before \nprocurement. \n79.  Project  civil  works  will  consist  of  construction  and/or  upgrade  of  learning  facilities, \ndormitories, and water and sanitation facilities at TTCs and secondary schools. The civil works \ncomponent will be financed by ADB and the government and will be awarded on the basis of \nnational competitive bidding procedure, following Government procedures acceptable to ADB. \nThe project director, assisted by the project staff and technical unit in charge, will also ensure \nthat appropriate maintenance contractual arrangements are signed prior to the commissioning \nof civil works at the expense of the government in order to ensure that the constructed civil \nworks are well maintained during their economic life.  \n80.  Consulting  Services.  The  project  will  be  supported  by  approximately  553  person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services  (219  person-months  international  and  334  person-months \nnational). The selection and engagement of consulting services will be procured in a single \npackage requiring a full technical proposal and using a quality-cost ratio of 80:20 for quality and \ncost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The consulting services are designed to provide technical support \nto the Project management and implementation, as well as to build longer-term institutional \n                                                 \n15  To procure existing textbooks and instructional materials that are in copyright, direct purchasing or single or sole \nsourcing will be used due to the fact that such materials are available from only a single proprietary source, namely \nPDH.  \n ", "18   \ndevelopment and capacity for planning, management, delivery of professional development for \nteachers, and secondary education. The consulting services cover broad areas of expertise that \ninclude (i) institutional development, (ii) MIS development, (iii) professional development for \nteachers, (iv) curriculum and materials development (including ICT), (v) examination reform, (vi) \nfacilities  and  equipment  improvement,  and  (vii)  gender  and  equitable  access.  ADB  has \napproved advance action for recruitment of consultants. The EA may start the process of \nselection of consultants. Advance action does not include signing of the contract with the \nidentified consultant firm. Outline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 9.  \n \n81.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nRecipient will ensure that information regarding procurement, including a list of participating \nbidders, name of the winning bidder, and procedures adopted in awarding contracts, is posted \non the MoEYS website. The Recipient will also ensure that criteria and procedure for selection \nof candidates for scholarships is also posted on the MoEYS website.16 A Good Governance \nFramework for Cambodia is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n82.  Disbursement Arrangements. To expedite project implementation through the timely \nrelease of ADB funds for eligible expenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by \nthe Government at the National Bank of Cambodia or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  shall  not  exceed  the  lower  of  (i)  estimated \nexpenditure for the first 6 months of Project implementation, or (ii) the equivalent of 10% of the \nGrant amount. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will delegate the authority to operate the \nimprest account to the EA in order to facilitate access to project funds to implement project \nactivities. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook17 (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe limit on statement of expenditure procedure and the initial advance to the imprest account will also \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n83.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. MoEYS will maintain records and accounts to \nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including \nfinancial statements, statement of expenditures, and imprest account records, will be audited \nannually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditors\u2019 report and copies of \nthe certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use \nof grant proceeds, compliance with grant covenants, and use of the imprest account under \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 \nmonths after the close of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. The independent external auditing \nservices will be financed by the Grant. \n                                                 \n16  A project-specific website was developed during the project design phase and is linked to the MoEYS website.  \n17  It should be noted that this handbook is applicable to both loan and grant-funded ADB investment projects and \nprograms. \n ", "    19     \n84.  The EA will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to ADB \nwithin 30 days of the end of each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and \nwill indicate, among other things, (i) the progress made against established targets, (ii) problems \nencountered during the last quarter, (iii) steps taken to resolve problems, (iv) compliance with \ngrant covenants, and (v) a proposed program of activities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 \nmonths after physical completion of the project, the EA will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport on project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n85.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. General baseline studies will be \nundertaken  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project.  The  monitoring  and  recording  system  and \nprocedures will be reviewed and improved. A new project performance management system will \nbe  developed  and  institutionalized  within  MoEYS  to  monitor  and  evaluate  implementation \nperformance  and  development  impact  at  various  stages  of  the  project  cycle.  Project \nperformance  monitoring  will  focus  on  project  implementation  plans  and  targets,  and  their \nexecution  and  achievement.  Performance  evaluations  will  examine  the  impact  of  project \ninterventions, problems and constraints faced, their causes, and solutions to them.  \n86.  Project  Review.  ADB  and  the  government  will  jointly  undertake  half-yearly  project \nreviews to assess progress in each component, identify constraints, and determine ways to \novercome them. Before each review, the EA will prepare progress reports on a quarterly basis \nand submit these to ADB and the Government. \n87.  ADB and the Government will conduct a midterm review during the last quarter of the \nthird year of project implementation to inform planning for the second half of the project. The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and project implementation arrangements; (ii) \nidentify changes needed; (iii) assess performance against targets and benchmarks; (iv) review \nlessons  and  experiences  in  education  quality  enhancement,  focusing  on  the  curriculum, \ntextbooks, and teaching and learning facilities; (v) review compliance with grant agreements and \ncovenants; and (vi) recommend changes in project design and/or implementation arrangements. \nThe findings will be discussed at a midterm workshop to be attended by representatives from \nthe ministries of Economy and Finance, Women's Affairs, and Planning, concerned MoEYS \nagencies, provincial and district education officials, the consultants, and ADB. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n88.  Project Benefits and Impacts. In Cambodia, the quality of educational achievement is \nrelatively poor, and investments in improving education quality will have significant positive \nreturns.  Substantial  economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  efficiency  gains  as  a  result  of \nimprovements in quality. Students who do not drop out increase their future earning potential. \nStudies indicate that each extra year of schooling increases labor productivity and income \nearned. Similarly, reduction in repetition rates increases the number of wage-earning years. \nImproved quality of education will lead to a greater number of graduates at different levels of \nschooling. Investments in secondary education will encourage more of the students completing \nprimary education to continue their studies, thus increasing their wage potential. Improved \ninternal efficiency will reduce the cost of schooling, thereby freeing up resources for expansion \nof education and for inputs to enhance its quality. The scholarships will provide opportunity for \ngirls and students from remote and disadvantaged areas to continue their education at the \nupper secondary level. This will have a positive impact on their labor productivity as well as on \nthe income levels of their families.  \n \n ", "20   \n89.  Greater  equity  in  education  reduces  socioeconomic  disparities  and  leads  to  better \nintegrated and more harmonious societies. Long-term benefits include (i) human development \nand  productivity  efficiency  through  a  better  qualified  teaching  and  managerial  staff  and \nincreased numbers of higher quality secondary students; (ii) social benefits derived from girls' \neducation such as (a) lower fertility, (b) increased prenatal care utilization, (c) improved health \nand nutrition status of families, and (d) higher educational attainment by their children; and (iii) \ngreater  wealth  redistribution  gains  as  a  result  of  support  to  students  from  remote  and \ndisadvantaged areas.  \n \n90.  The  education  system  will  benefit  from  (i)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  for \nplanning, management, design, and delivery of education services; (ii) improved facilities in \nTTCs and schools; (iii) improved and upgraded curriculum for preservice teacher training and \nsecondary education; (iv) enhanced competencies of teacher trainers and teachers; (v) school \nnetworks for outreach to strengthen school management and teacher competencies; and (vi) \nincreased availability of teaching and/or learning materials in TTCs and secondary schools.  \n \n91.  Direct benefits from the Project will accrue to (i) academic staff and management of NIE \nand  the  24  TTCs  through  improved  facilities  and  teaching  and/or  learning  resources,  and \ntraining for enhancing their competencies; (ii) approximately 8,500 teacher trainees over 5 years \nthrough  activities  designed  to  improve  preservice  courses;  (iii)  approximately  14,400 \nunderqualified secondary teachers benefiting from in-service training; (iv) 300 upper secondary \nschools  benefiting  from  technical  assistance  in  school  management,  networking  and \nimprovement planning; (v) staff of MoEYS, including provincial and district office teams, trained \nto strengthen their capacity to plan, manage, administer, and regulate the system; and (vi) 600 \ntrainee teachers from accommodation in new and rehabilitated dormitories. At the school level \ndirect benefits will accrue to (i) all secondary schools; (ii) 4,000 disadvantaged students through \nscholarships;  (iii)  350,000  students  from  textbooks  and  improved  facilities  and  learning \nmaterials; and (iv) approximately 7,000 students through the provision of teachers\u2019 guides and \nimproved teaching and/or learning facilities. Benefits of the reforms and quality improvements in \nteacher training will also extend to a population of school students that is currently around 3.4 \nmillion. \n \n92.  Environment and Social Safeguards. The Project involves upgrading of facilities at \nexisting TTCs and schools where all work, including construction of new facilities, will be carried \nout on existing property owned by the schools, TTCs, and NIE. School upgrading will require \nsmall-scale civil works, and no negative environmental impact is expected. As the Project will \nnot require land acquisition and targets children who are already in the school system, there will \nbe no negative impact on community life or socioeconomic or cultural integrity. \n \n93.  Risks. The Project has been designed with extensive stakeholder participation. There is \nownership and commitment at all levels of government, and within its allied agencies and \ninstitutions, to the proposals contained in the Project.  \n \n94.  The main risk emanates from weak management and institutional capacity. This could \nhamper timely implementation of project activities, since the expansion of activities will place \nadditional demands on all Government agencies involved in project implementation. The Project \nmitigates this risk by providing extensive and carefully targeted technical support to strengthen \ncapacity  of  the  concerned  agencies,  and  enhance  staff  skills  and institutional  capacity  for \ncontinuing qualitative support to education. The project also provides for a realistic time-frame \nwith implementation over a 6-year period. \n \n ", "    21     \n95.  Sustainability. The Project will generate continuing additional incremental cost of over \n$1 million annually after the project period through the operation and maintenance of facilities \nand  equipment.  These costs  will  be  a  continuation  of  recurrent  costs  the  government  will \nsupport during project implementation, and can be reduced with proper and efficient use of \nfacilities and equipment. The Project supports training for personnel in the use of equipment and \nmanagement of facilities. Efficiency gains are also expected to offset the additional resource \nrequirements.  Some  project  gains  that  (i)  strengthen  capacity,  (ii)  upgrade  teacher \ncompetencies, and (iii) improve the curriculum, classroom assessment and examination, and \nthe  provision  of  textbooks  and  other  materials  to  enhance  learning,  will  have  long-term \nbeneficial impact and are not susceptible to short-term resource constraints. An economic and \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 10. \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n96.

The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) is responsible for leading, \nmanaging, developing, and providing education to the children of Cambodia. MoEYS has \nhigh-level established positions of minister, secretary of state, and under secretary of state \noverseeing six structures at the directorate level (administration and finance, education, \nhigher education, youth and sport, and the inspectorate general plus an Education for All \nsecretariat). Below these directorates, inspectorate, and secretariat structures are a number \nof supporting technical departments. MoEYS also has education offices at provincial and \ndistrict level, and school management related to communities and communes. In November \n2004, responsibility for technical and vocational education was transferred to the newly \nestablished Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training. \n2.  To  deliver  education services the  system  has  a  number  of  levels,  starting  with \npreschool for children aged 3\u20135. Basic education covers a 9-year period, with primary school \ncovering grades 1\u20136 and lower secondary covering grades 7\u20139. Upper secondary level \n(grade 10) begins with a national examination at the end of grade 9 and finishes with a \nnational examination at the end of grade 12. Technical and vocational education training \nprograms run parallel to the upper secondary programs at grades 10, 11, and 12, but are not \nthe responsibility of MoEYS. Higher-education programs are run at various universities and \ninstitutes.  \n3.  In the 2006\u20132007 school year there were 9,018 schools with 80,733 classes. There \nwere 3,387,310 students, of whom 1,574,900 were girls. The number of teachers was \n77,794  teachers,  32,068  of  whom  were  women.  The  schools  served  the  2,530,000 \nhouseholds that make up 13,406 villages, 185 districts, and 24 provinces (including the four \nmunicipalities).1  \n4.  In  the  Education  Statistics  and  Indicators  2006\u20132007  (MoEYS  2006)  secondary \nschools (colleges and lyc\u00e9es) and school levels (lower and upper secondary) are defined. \nThe 846 colleges are lower secondary schools with grades 7\u20139. However, some lower \nsecondary schools may not have all three grades. The 283 lyc\u00e9es are upper secondary \nschools with grades 10\u201312 but some also have lower secondary grades. Statistics relating to \nthe lower secondary level are collected from all schools with grades 7\u20139 (1,112 schools) and \nstatistics relating to the upper secondary level are collected from all schools with grades 10\u2013\n12 (283 schools2). In 2006\u20132007 at the upper secondary level there were 222,271 students \n(88,701 of them girls) studying in 4,303 classes being taught by 6,688 teachers (1,956 \nfemales). At the lower secondary level there were 626,005 students (285,699 girls) in 12,633 \nclasses being taught by 20,485 teachers (6,890 females).3  \n5.  In 2006\u20132007 at the national level the gross enrolment ratio (GER) at primary level \nwas 122.7% at lower secondary 60.0% and at upper secondary 21.2% The figures for girls \nwere 119.3%, 54.5% and 17.2 % respectively. The net enrolment ratio (NER) at primary \nlevel was 92.1% at lower secondary 33.7% and at upper secondary 12.5% with girls\u2019 net \nenrolment being 91%, 33.1% and 11.3% respectively. Transition rates from primary to lower \nsecondary  were  78.7%  and  from  lower  secondary  to  upper  secondary  66.2%.  \nCorresponding rates for girls were 77.1% and 65.8%.  Pupil-teacher ratios were 51.3% for \nprimary, 30.6% for lower secondary, and 33.2 % for upper secondary. As the statistics \nindicate, enrolments at the primary level have grown rapidly, expanding 13% between 1997\u2013\n1998 and 2006\u20132007. The rates of expansion at the lower secondary (135%) and upper \n                                                 \n1  MoEYS. 2006. 2002-06 Education Indicators.

For planning purposes the DGE figure will be \nused.  \n3  MoEYS. 2006. Education Statistics, 2005\u20132006. Phnom Penh. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nsecondary (260%) education have been even higher during the same period. However, \noverall enrolments at the upper and lower secondary level remain low. This is largely a \nconsequence of poor geographic access to lower secondary schools, which act as a bridge \nbetween primary and upper secondary schooling. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe World Bank are both supporting construction of lower secondary schools. Through the \nsecond Education Sector Development Program4 ADB is supporting construction of 400 \nlower secondary schools. The World Bank is supporting construction of 280 lower secondary \nschools through the CESSP.5 The impact of this on enrolments at the lower secondary level \nwill be felt in the coming years. The second Education Sector Development Program is also \nproviding for 49 new secondary schools to cater to the growing demand for secondary \nschooling.  \n6.  Under the education strategy set out within the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy \nfor Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, the Government will continue to increase \nbudget expenditures and mobilize increased international assistance to (i) enable incentives \nfor teachers; (ii) assure quality instruction; (iii) increase provision of educational materials, \nequipment, libraries, and laboratories; (iv) build dormitories for students, especially female \nstudents; (v) continue to reform curricula and training programs; (vi) provide scholarships to \npoor  students;  (vii)  promote  literacy  and  informal  education  programs;  (viii)  finance \nconstruction of schools in rural areas; and (ix) support school operating costs. The highest \npriority is given to implementation of the national Education for All (EFA) plan and associated \nteacher development programs.  \n7.  The Education Strategic Plan (ESP) planning process has, through more than one \ncycle, taken the policy and strategy dimensions described above and defined actions and \ntargets. The aim of the Education Sector Support Program (ESSP) 2006\u201320106 is to outline \nhow the policies and strategies laid out in the ESP 2006\u20132010 will be put into practice. The \nbasic principle adopted in the ESSP is that programs will be planned and implemented \nthrough the Government and MoEYS systems rather than through parallel modalities. The \nmanagement framework for ESSP places the focus on strengthening appropriate MoEYS \ndirectorates  and  departments  at  central  and  provincial  levels,  including  delegation  of \nresponsibilities to districts, clusters and/or communes, and schools. The National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan endorses the ESSP 2006\u20132010. It is anticipated that the draft Education \nLaw when passed will set a framework for the implementation and consolidation of a number \nof these policies. \n8.  The  ESSP  2006\u20132010  policy  action  matrix  divides  the  policy  actions  into  three \ncategories: equitable access, quality and efficiency, and institution and capacity building. \nEquitable access policy actions will (i) expand access to Early Childhood Education, (ii) \nensure entry of all 6-year-olds into primary school, (iii) reduce parental cost barriers, (iv) \nreduce repetition and drop out levels in all grades, (v) enable greater community involvement \nin all stages of schooling, (vi) continue provision of new schools or additional facilities; (vii) \nincrease enrolment in grades 7\u20139, (viii) increase enrolments in grades 10\u201312, (ix) ensure \nteacher provision in remote and disadvantaged areas; (x) improve the efficiency of staff \ndeployment, (xi) ensure widely expanded provision of quality upper secondary education, \n(xii) increase the number of scholarships for students from poor families; (xiii) expand the \nprovision of quality higher education, and (xiv) expand public, nongovernment organization \n(NGO), and/or community partnerships in Non-formal Education in border and remote areas. \nTwo major interventions funded by the World Bank and ADB are rapidly changing the scale \nof access to secondary education in support of the ESP 2006\u20132010.

Quality  and  efficiency  policy  actions  will  (i)  increase  service  remuneration  and \nincentives linked to performance; (ii) improve the quality of teaching and learning through \nnationwide implementation of child-friendly schools; (iii) increase the schools and training \ninstitutions\u2019  operational  autonomy  and  accountability  regarding  operational  budgets  and \ndecisions on programs; (iv) implement the new curriculum policy; (v) improve preservice and \nin-service teacher development; (vi) strengthen teacher and learning quality (pedagogy and \nICT); (vii) implement the minimum standards of student achievement for grades 3, 6, and 9; \nand (viii) increase transparency and improve performance monitoring and accountability of \nteachers, schools, and postsecondary institutions. \n \n10.  Institution  and  capacity-building  policy  actions  will  (i)  provide  a  clearly  defined \nlegislative regulatory framework to the sector; (ii) improve predictability for medium-term \nfinancial planning; (iii) strengthen education system performance monitoring; (iv) strengthen \ncentral, provincial, and district financial monitoring systems; (v) assure that all designated \nbudget management centers become operational; (vi) strengthen personnel management \nand monitoring systems; and (vii) improve higher education institutional development and \ncapacity. \n \n11.  Despite measures to promote equal access of girls to education, gender disparity still \npersists widely in education in terms of enrolment, retention, and completion of primary, \nlower secondary, and upper secondary education. Boys and girls start schooling on an equal \nfooting in primary education but the drop out rate among girl students starts to go up as they \nprogress through the grades, particularly after completion of primary education. Poverty is \nthe overriding reason for gender disparities in terms of enrolment and literacy. Among \nfemale students drop out rates reduce with each successive grade completed. The net \nenrolment rate of children in secondary education in ethnic minority and disadvantaged \nareas is much lower than the national average. Along with poverty, the distant location of \nschools,  language  barriers,  disproportionate  teacher-student  ratios,  and  inappropriate \ninstructional materials, are the major factors that keep children of ethnic minority groups \naway from school. These factors affect girls of ethnic minorities more than boys. Potentially \nsome of these issues can be addressed through enhancing enrolment of teacher trainees \nfrom ethnic minority and disadvantaged areas at NIE and regional TTCs.  \n12.  Overall, general progress has been made in the education sector in recent years and \nconsiderable progress has been made in the last 5 years on implementing education sector \nplanning and reforms. This includes (i) reductions in cost barriers, (ii) effective enrolment \ncampaigns, (iii) the introduction of school operating budgets and remedial classes, (iv) \nsubstantial increases in the Government\u2019s recurrent spending on education, and (v) the \ngrowth  of  policy-led  support.  Attention  is  now  shifting  to  strengthening  the  quality  and \nefficiency of the education sector.   \n13.  Education quality is determined by a set of multifaceted and interrelated subsectors. \nThese include (i) efficiency of decision making, (ii) provision and deployment of teachers, (iii) \nteacher training and retraining, (iv) remuneration systems, (v) curriculum development and \ntextbook provision, (vi) valid and reliable assessment of the achievement of students and the \nperformance of schools, (vii) provision of good and well-supported computer systems to \nenhance learning and teaching programs and infrastructure (such as school buildings and \nclassrooms, furniture, and teaching aids), and (viii) an efficient and effective mechanism for \ncollecting  data.  To  improve  quality,  five  components  are  needed:  (i)  building  enough \nclassrooms, (ii) providing enough qualified teachers in all subjects, (iii) providing enough \nmaterials for teaching and learning, (iv) improving the quality of living for teachers, especially \nin more remote locations, and (v) providing opportunities for professional development. \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n14.  To improve both decision making and implementation, there is a need to review \nMoEYS\u2019  organization  and  functions  to  clarify  departmental  and  office  roles,  reduce \noverlapping functions, and to further respond to decentralization and deconcentration policy. \n15.  Primary  school  teacher  demand  projections  indicate  that  the  total  number  of \nadditional  teachers  needed  for  the  period  from  now  until  2015  will  be  30,384.  Lower \nsecondary school teacher demand projections indicate a total shortfall of 41,507 teachers \nfrom 2007 to 2015. Upper secondary school teacher demand projections indicate that there \nis a total additional demand during the 2007\u20132015 period for 36,090 upper secondary \nteachers. It is difficult to predict teacher demand for the new elective subject system for \ngrades 11 and 12 due to the uncertainty of school and student choice. \n16.  Teacher education is provided through national, regional, and provincial providers. \nNIE runs programs training university graduates to become upper secondary teachers. \nLower secondary teachers are trained at regional TTCs and primary teachers are taught at \nprovincial TTCs. The Pre-school Teacher Training College in Phnom Penh trains preschool \nteachers. NIE also trains educational administrators. During the academic year 2005\u20132006,7 \n7,261 teachers were in training, of whom 3,034 were women.8  \n17.  To improve quality at the upper secondary school level, including at those in remote \nareas,  additional  teachers  need  to  be  deployed  so  that  more  subjects  can  be  taught \ncompetently. The current situation results in schools opening but students not attending \nbecause they do not wish to study under conditions where teacher competencies do not \nmeet curriculum requirements. There is also a need to ensure a future supply of upper \nsecondary teachers. Estimates suggest that the current capacity of NIE will be inadequate \nfor future supply in the medium term.  \n18.  The six regional TTCs provide 2-year programs to train lower secondary teachers. \nThere is an identified need to improve the living environment (dormitories, cooking facilities \nand toilets) in addition to expanding facilities that relate to science, ICT, and multimedia. The \nprovincial TTCs located throughout the country provide 2-year programs to train primary \nteachers. The role of provincial TTCs is changing as they become responsible for training \nbasic education teachers and with the merging of some of the regional and provincial TTCs.  \n19.  The ESSP prioritizes a TTC staff development program and a responsive preservice \nand  in-service  teacher  training  program  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  secondary  school \nteachers and trainers. These programs are linked to the planned introduction of teacher \nstandards, teacher training standards, and improved systems of performance monitoring. A \nsystem of formal certification is proposed in the ESSP as a foundation for the development \nof the national teacher education system. To achieve this, the TTD at MoEYS will need to \nestablish  criteria  and  procedures  for  assessment  of  competencies  and  certification  of \ncourses that teachers and trainers attend. The information will be required by the MoEYS \nDepartment of Personnel in relation to management of the performance monitoring and \neducation management information system (MIS). \n20.  A secondary education development plan being prepared by the Department of \nGeneral Secondary Education identifies a number of improvement areas, underpinned by a \nnumber of strategies to enhance the quality of secondary education. This plan has a focus \non providing a context for the construction of secondary schools under the second Education \nSector Development Program. There is an awareness that a comprehensive plan would \ncover five broad areas: (i) enhancing the skills of the secondary education workforce; (ii) \n                                                 \n7  Data from TTD, MoEYS approved on 9 March 2007, indicates total enrolment for 2006\u20132007 is 8,880 (4,019 \nwomen). \n8  Data from Teacher Training Department (TTD), MoEYS approved on 9 March 2007, TA 4823-CAM document \nD12, consolidated reports of technical assistance team (ADB. 2006.

Manila.). \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nstrengthening the secondary school support structures with MoEYS; (iii) ongoing secondary \nschool improvement; (iv) supporting secondary teaching and learning; and (v) enhancing \nfacilities, resources, and funding for secondary education. Currently there is inadequate \nresourcing for a comprehensive secondary education development plan.   \n21.  A process of developing and introducing new curricula is underway throughout the \nschool system. To this end, MoEYS has an approved policy and master plan for curriculum \ndevelopment for the period 2005\u20132009. PRD is responsible for curriculum development and \nhas received support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nat the basic education level and from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in \nmathematics and three science subjects at upper secondary level. To date, new curricula \nhave been developed for lower secondary Khmer, mathematics, social studies, and the \nsciences, and for upper secondary mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics. PRD \nwould  benefit  from  technical  assistance  to  support  the  conceptualization,  design,  and \ndevelopment of the outstanding new curricula, and in particular in areas which are less \nfamiliar than the traditional school subjects. As well as drawing on consultancy support in \nthese areas, PRD may consider a strategy of acquiring existing curricula and courses. Such \ncourses might be adopted or adapted to a Cambodian context from materials that are in use \nelsewhere in the region. This may particularly be the case for foreign languages (English and \nFrench) and some of the proposed Elective Vocational Education Program (EVEP) subjects \nsuch as tourism and ICT. Future systems should require PRD to proceed with developing \ncurricula with less direct intervention. It should build on the experience gained from the \nUSAID-funded Basic Education Project but technical assistance should focus on provisions \nto build the capacity of PRD curriculum writers to enhance their roles in curriculum writing \nand the management of the process of developing textbooks, teachers\u2019 guides, and other \ninstructional materials. MoEYS\u2019 stated policy is to ensure the adequate provision of core \ninstructional materials on a national basis and to encourage the process of widening choice \n(and therefore quality) in the provision of textbooks by opening the textbook market to supply \nby multiple publishers. This will allow decentralization and more flexibility in the purchase of \ncore learning materials at the school level, with a consequent gain in quality and cost \nbenefits for MoEYS. However, MoEYS\u2019 policy has been difficult to implement due to a \ncomplex set of factors. The result has been that, so far, textbook production remains the \nmonopoly of PHD. Centralized procurement also results in delays in textbook procurement.  \n22.  Reforms  in  assessment  and  examinations  are  needed  to  support  the  national \ncurriculum reform and to ensure valid and reliable measurement of student achievement, \nwhich will in turn contribute significantly to quality assurance in education. The national \npolicy on assessment should also address quality assurance of internal assessment (e.g., \nthrough external moderation of school assessments by the PRD Research and Evaluation \nOffice)  and  ensure  equitable  access  to  assessment  for  students  with  disabilities.  The \nDirectorate of General Education Examinations Office currently lacks capacity. A phased \nstrengthening of its capacity is needed both through training and introduction of ICT-led \nimprovements  to  the  management  of  assessment,  administration,  and  record  keeping. \nComputer-generated examinations and computer-based marking can improve validity and \nreliability, improve examination security, and reduce costs in the long term. Teachers need \nto be trained and supported in the development of assessment tools and question papers \nthat assess students against curriculum standards in grades 3, 6, and 9 in a valid and \nreliable way. The School Based Assessment in other grades needs to be related to the \nassessment against curriculum standards in grades 3, 6, and 9 to ensure continuity and \nprogression in the assessment of students and reporting to parents and students. The \ntraining of teachers will be greatly facilitated by the development and distribution of exemplar \nassessment tasks and question papers. The process would also benefit from an approach in \nwhich teachers were able to get access to expert support at a local level. Capacity needs to \nbe developed at regional and school level to implement a systematic program of training and \nsupport. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n23.  MISs  in  MoEYS  remain  weak.  Mechanisms  for  data  gathering,  retention,  and \nmanipulation are minimal at the point of collection. MISs often do not have the capacity to \ninterconnect with another, not only because the basic data sets are incompatible but also \nbecause the staff lack the analytical skills. This is the case with current MISs. Where they \nexist, basic data sets are held within systems which are associated with a specific entity. \nCurrently MoEYS has a number of information systems: an education MIS centered in the \nMoEYS Department of Planning, a finance MIS in the Department of Finance, and a human \nresources  MIS  in  the  Department  of  Personnel.  The  education  MIS  system  does  not \ninterrelate with the human resources or finance MIS. The human resources MIS is supported \nby  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  the  European  Union,  and  the \neducation  MIS  is  supported  by  UNICEF  and  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency (Sida). Other systems exist or are planned, and these relate to school \nconstruction, nonformal education, higher education, and the Department of Information and \nASEAN Affairs. \n ", "  Appendix  3  35 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n \nA.  Projected Trends in External Assistance \n \n1.  Total external funding to the education sector for the period 2005\u20132010 is estimated \nat $327.6 million, with $97.2 million actually spent in 2005, $100.1 million in 2006, and \n$130.3  million  projected  for  2007\u20132010.  The  total  funding  is  financed  by  124  donor \norganizations through 324 outstanding projects. Of the total projected financing for the \n2005\u20132010 period, 29% is expected to come from United Nations (UN) agencies, 26% from \ninternational nongovernment organizations (NGOs), 15% from bilateral agencies, 8% from \ninternational organizations, 4% from local NGOs, 2% from research institutes, and 17% from \nother sources. Although the funding amount is aggregated, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the World Bank, the European Commission, and the UN agencies are among the \nbiggest donors to the country's education sector.

In terms of annual budget allocation and disbursement, 29.7% of the total budget \nwas actually disbursed in 2005, an estimated 30.5% was disbursed in 2006, and it is \nprojected that the remainder will be disbursed in the following proportions: 18.7% in \n2007, 10.9% in 2008, 6.4% in 2009, and 3.8% in 2010. This projection has not taken into \naccount further annual commitments (and disbursements) by the donor community to \nCambodia at annual Donor Consultative Group meetings.  \n \n3.  With regard to budget by subsector, the total 2005\u20132010 budget is allocated as \nfollows: 34.2% for primary education quality and efficiency; 9.9% for nonformal education \nexpansion; 8.3% for facility expansion; 6.8% for continuous teacher education; 6.6% for \ncapacity building; 6.5% for higher education quality, efficiency, and equitable access; 3.7% \nfor  lower  secondary  education  access,  quality,  and  efficiency;  3.4%  for  secondary \n ", "36   Appendix 3 \nscholarships for the poor; 3.3% for upper secondary education access and equitable access; \n2.9%  for  early  childhood  education;  1.9%  for  core  instructional  materials;  0.6%  for \nstrengthened monitoring systems; 0.6% for education service efficiency; 0.2% for youth and \nsport development, and the remaining 10% is allocated to other subsectors. Details are \npresented in Table A3.1.  \n \n4.  It  is  noted  that  allocated  investment  in  (lower  and  upper)  secondary  education \naccess, quality, and efficiency accounts for just 7.1% of the total budget compared with \n34.2% for primary education quality and efficiency. In this regard, more funding should be \nallocated to improvement of the quality of secondary education due to its significant social \nreturns from this subsector. To this end, ADB's focus in the Project is well justified. \n \n5.  By geography, the donor budget distribution for 2005\u20132010 is balanced, taking into \naccount population, poverty severity, and other economic and demographic indicators. The \ndistribution is also observed to be balanced between nondisadvantaged and disadvantaged \nprovinces. It is indicated that the budget for Phnom Penh accounts for 18% of the total \n2005\u20132010 budget. However, this high proportion is due to the fact that allocations to line \nministries are aggregated in this category, rather than Phnom Penh being counted as a \nnormal administrative unit.  \n \nB.  Responding to Future Funding Requirements \n \n6.  The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) has endorsed the national \nEducation Strategic Plan (ESP) 2006\u20132010. The required funding to successfully achieve \nthe ESP objectives is estimated at $864 million for the 2006\u20132010 period. Annual projected \nfunding required is as follows: $140.7 million (16.3%) for 2006, $162.4 million (18.8%) for \n2007,  $172.9 million  (20%) for  2008, $188  million  (21.8%)  for 2009,  and  $200  million \n(23.1%) for 2010 (Table A3.1). \n \nTable A3.1: Funding Required to Finance the Education Strategic Plan Expenditure \n2006\u20132010 \n($ million) \nItem  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2006\u20132010 \nRecurrent Expenditure  112.4  137.7  150.1  167.0  179.5  746.6 \nCapital Expenditure  28.4  24.7  22.9  21.0  20.5  117.4 \nTotal Funding Required  140.7  162.4  172.9  188.0  200.0  864.0 \n%  16.3  18.8  20.0  21.8  23.1  100.0 \nSource: MoEYS Education Strategic Plan 2006\u20132010. \n \n7.  Although Cambodia's economic growth prospects are bright with high projected gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth rates, public revenue (mainly from tax collection) will not be \ncapable of funding the implementation of the ESP 2006\u20132010. Continued donor support is \nneeded and the Project grant will significantly support the ESP implementation process. \n \n ", "    Appendix 4 37\n     \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \nLow enrolment of boys and girls in disadvantaged areas in secondary education is a major issue in Cambodia, as the \nGovernment aims to achieve 9-year basic schooling for all children by 2015 and implement its Education Sector Plan \n(ESP) 2006\u20132010. The total net enrolment ratio (NER) in 2006\u20132007 is estimated at 33.7% (33.1% for females) at lower \nsecondary level and 12.5% (11.3% for females) at upper secondary level. Quality education can improve the skills \nefficiency and productivity of human resources, and help achieve sustainable growth within a globally competitive \nenvironment. Secondary education widens opportunities through enhanced employability. About 54% of the total \npopulation is economically active and 7% is unemployed. According to the Socio-economic Survey (2004),1 only 4% of \nthe labor force in 2004 had received upper secondary or postsecondary education. The Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency sets out the Government\u2019s education strategy. In particular, it targets \nenhancing human resources with high technical and scientific skills that effectively respond to the labor market. The \nNational Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 targets education as one of the important factors in poverty reduction. \nThe plan endorses the ESP, and emphasizes development of the teaching workforce. Investment to improve teaching \nquality and enrolment of girls in upper secondary education is necessary to support Government efforts in achieving the \nCambodia Millennium Development Goal 3, Target 1, of improving the ratio of girls to boys in upper secondary \neducation from 48% in 2001 to 100% in 2015. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nCambodia had an estimated 14 million people in 2006, with a population growth rate of 1.8% per annum and a per \ncapita income of $385. About 36% of the population lives below the national poverty line and one in five Cambodians \nlives under the food poverty line.2 According to the Socio-economic Survey (2004), 91% of poor people live in rural \nareas. In Tonle Sap 45% people live in severe poverty. The corresponding figure in the mountain and plateau regions \nis 56%. Poor households have a higher dependency burden and lack human capital. They tend to (i) be uneducated, \nunskilled, and unhealthy; (ii) have limited access to rural infrastructure and markets; and (iii) be more vulnerable to \nland rights and housing tenure issues.  \n \nPoor students are more visible at the primary level (20%) than the upper secondary (2%) or tertiary (0%) level. In \ncomparison, nearly 61% of upper secondary students and 57% of tertiary students come from the richest 20% of the \npopulation. The following factors hinder basic education attainment levels in disadvantaged areas: (i) high levels of \npoverty, (ii) distant location of the school, (iii) lack of teachers particularly from ethnic minority groups, (iv) lack of \neducational materials, (v) lack of toilets, (vi) lack of security measures, and (vii) poor quality education. Girls are more \nhindered by these factors, as a higher proportion of girls than boys between the ages of 15 and 19 are part of the labor \nforce. A recent survey found that out of about 1.6 million school-aged children not attending school full time, about \n25% indicated household income and/or work responsibilities as the main reason for nonattendance, while only 8% \nstated a lack of accessible education provision.   \n \nThe education system relies heavily on households\u2019 private contributions for both direct and indirect education costs. \nOn average, unofficial monthly school fees per student, excluding incidentals such as uniforms, are KR3,500 ($0.9) at \nthe primary level, KR8,000 ($2) at the lower secondary level, and KR10,200 ($2.5) at the upper secondary level. \nAccording to the Socio-economic Survey (2004), annual educational expenses per student includes school fees, \ntuition, textbooks, school supplies, gifts to teachers, and contributions to building funds. Households estimate \neducational  expenses  at  KR50,000  ($12.5)  for  preschool  and  primary  school  students,  KR393,000  ($100)  for \nsecondary school students, KR1.1 million ($275) for technical or vocational school students and KR 2.1 million ($525) \nfor university students. According to the Socio-economic Survey (2004), parents are willing to pay 10 times as much \nfor quality private schooling, especially at the secondary level. This is more common among the more affluent \nhouseholds in urban areas who are willing to pay substantially for high-quality education.  \n \nThe Project aims to increase the NER of children of disadvantaged families and/or areas in secondary education from \n73% in 2006\u20132007 to 80% by 2020. The Project will employ a number of strategies aimed at addressing the impacts \nof poverty and other associated factors on the educational attainment of children in disadvantaged areas.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No \n \nA number of approaches were used to consult with stakeholders during project preparation, such as (i) a review of key \ndocuments and regulations, (ii) key informant interviews, (iii) meetings, (iv) task force and technical working group \nmeetings, (v) visits to relevant institutions, (vi) national workshops, (vii) the education sector working group, and (viii) a \n                                                 \n1  National Institute of Statistic, Ministry of Planning. 2005.

Yes                   No \n \nA participation strategy is integral to project implementation, which reflects the consultation process at the central, \nprovincial, district, institutional, and project levels that was undertaken during project preparation.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAccording to the Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey 2004,3 in urban areas the unemployment rate of females is \n6.7%, compared with 7.6% among males. In rural areas the unemployment rate of males is also marginally higher. A \nnumber of studies reveal a link between poverty and the higher drop out rates among female students at secondary \nlevel, especially in the disadvantaged areas.4 Poverty helps widen gender disparities in enrolment and literacy. Among \nfemales, drop out rates reduce with each successive grade completed. Although direct costs of education are the \nsame for boys and girls, parents generally perceive higher opportunity costs and lower benefits from educating \ndaughters. Opportunity costs increase with the increase in age of girls, especially when they reach an age officially \nacceptable for entry into the formal job market. \n \nStrategies designed to maximize project impact on females include creating an environment conducive to increasing \nfemale literacy and retention rates through (i) better information dissemination to stakeholders including communities \nand parents; (ii) sex disaggregated data collection and analysis; (iii) improved upper secondary school facilities for \nequitable access (e.g., separate toilets for girls and dormitories for female students); (iv) greater proportion of \nscholarships for females; (v) orientation session on gender, disability, and ethnic minority issues for writers of \ninstructional materials to encourage equitable access for children from disadvantaged areas; (vi) gender awareness \nsessions included in the teacher training and leadership training programs; and (vii) monitoring and evaluation of the \nimplementation of the gender mainstreaming policy connected to an education management information system (MIS) \nreview. Gender-responsive outputs and indicators are also included in the design and monitoring framework. A gender \naction plan is in Appendix 5.  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nE.

The Project aims to increase the number of educated and skilled people from all sections \nof the population in Cambodia. The Project targets support to improve the quality of, and achieve \ngreater equity of, education by (i) strengthening capacity of institutions and agencies responsible \nfor  delivery  of  quality  education,  (ii)  improving  teaching  quality,  and  (iii)  strengthening  and \nexpanding the reach of quality secondary education. A gender action plan is prepared to highlight \nthe specific needs and interests of female students and teachers in upper secondary education in \nCambodia. It helps to ensure that women have equal access to training opportunities at all levels. \nThe gender action plan includes actions aimed at (i) facilitating performance and retention of girls \nfrom poor families in upper secondary schools, (ii) increasing the number of female teachers at \nsecondary schools, and (iii) promoting equal participation of female staff for quality secondary \neducation. The gender action plan is based on the gender analysis prepared for the Project. It is \ndesigned  according  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998), MoEYS\u2019 Gender Policy in Education (2006),1 and A Fair Share for Women: \nCambodia Gender Assessment.2 \n \nA.  Gender Issues in Upper Secondary Education \n \n2.  While gender disparities in education have decreased at all levels, low enrolment of boys \nand girls from remote and disadvantaged areas in secondary education remains a major issue \nin Cambodia. Four out of seven provinces classified as remote have high percentages of ethnic \nminorities.3 Net enrolment rates in primary education show virtual gender parity. However, the \ntotal net enrolment ratio in 2006\u20132007 is 33.7% (33.1% for females) at lower secondary schools \nand 12.5% (11.3% for females) at upper secondary schools. In both urban and rural areas, \nmore females are moving into higher grades and repetition rates are lower than that of males. \nHowever, drop out rates for women are still higher in urban and rural areas than they are for \nmales. Table A5.1 illustrates the number and percentage of females that enroll and repeat \ngrade 9, and transition to upper secondary school based on 2006\u20132007 Ministry of Education, \nYouth and Sport (MoEYS) statistics. \nTable A5.1: Percent of Female Lower Secondary Students that Complete Grade 9 \nand Transit to Upper Secondary School\n \nNumber of Students \nGrade 9 Enrolments   Repeating Within that Year  Transition Rate to Upper \nItem \n(2005\u20132006)  (2005\u20132006)  Secondary School (%) \nTotal  Female  %  Total  Female  %  Total  Female \nUrban  44,619  19,746  44  2,540    872    34  89.3  89.9 \nRural   105,795  43,745  41  4,250    1,016    24  55.6  53.9 \nRemote  1,464  614  42  32    6    19  29.7  26.3 \n  Total  151,878  64,105  42  6,822    1,894    28  66.2  65.8 \nMondulkiri  219  82  37  8    3    38  82.9  84.0 \nRatanakiri  502  196  39  50    18    36  71.8  76.6 \nStung Treng  900  408  45  10    6    60  72.0  89.3 \nOtdar Meanchey   1,052  397  38  35    10    29  63.4  62.9 \nKoh Kong   1,028  414  40  35    13    37  59.2  59.4 \nPreah Vihear   1,283  566  44  44    7    16  80.0  76.9 \nPailin  443  173  39  9    0  0  63.7  69.6 \nSource: MoEYS. 2007.

Studies reveal a link between poverty and the higher drop out rates among female \nstudents at secondary level of education, especially in disadvantaged areas.4 Poverty widens \ngender disparities in education in terms of enrolment and literacy. Among female students, \ndrop-out rates reduce with each successive grade completed. Although direct costs of education \nare the same for boys and girls, parents generally perceive higher opportunity costs and lower \nbenefits from educating their daughters. Opportunity costs increase with the increase in the age \nof girls, especially when they reach an age officially acceptable for entry into the formal job \nmarket. Common barriers for girls in accessing upper secondary education include poor quality \neducation, security, lack of toilets, lack of educational materials, early marriage, and the lack of \nfemale teachers in rural secondary schools.  \n \n4.  Enhanced quality of education has a direct impact on poverty reduction, as it is a priority \narea in human development and capacity building. Only 4% of the labor force in 2004 had \nreceived upper secondary or postsecondary education, according to the Socio-economic Survey \n(2004).5 The overall unemployment rate in urban areas was 7% (6.7% for females and 7.6% for \nmales) in 2004, according to the Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey 2004. In rural areas, \nthe unemployment rate for males is marginally higher than the rate for females. Improved quality \nsecondary education not only improves employment opportunities for young people but also \nimproves  the  skills  efficiency  and  productivity  of  human  resources  for  more  than  half  of \nCambodia\u2019s population (women comprise about 52% of Cambodia\u2019s total population).  \n \n5.  In addition, quality secondary education for young women contributes to better health, \nfamily welfare, economic growth, and intergenerational benefits. Educated mothers have fewer \nchildren, provide better nutrition for their children leading to improved family health, and also \nprovide for a fairer and more equitable intrahousehold allocation of resources, thus reducing \nfuture  gender  disparities.  Educated  mothers  tend  to  use  health  services  more  frequently, \nincreasing efficiencies of health care investments. This has been demonstrated by the recent \ndecline in total fertility rate from 4.0 children per mother to 3.3 children per mother (2005 CMDG \nReport).6 \n \nB.  Institutional Gender Disparities \n \n6.  Gender disparities also exist within MoEYS and within the education service. Within \nMoEYS, few women are appointed to top-level positions. Based on 2005 data, there is a total of \n102,712 officials in MoEYS. There is no female secretary of state or under secretary of state. \nWhile females are not found at the director or inspector-general levels, about 5% of deputy \ndirectors or inspectors general are women. Females account for about 10% of department \ndirectors and 12% of deputy directors. About 7.1% off upper secondary school directors and \n7.6% of vice directors are female (Table A5.2). \n \n7.  The proportion of female teachers in lower and upper secondary levels has remained \nrelatively constant. In 2005, about one third of an estimated 7,000 upper secondary school \nteachers and one third of an estimated 25,000 lower secondary school teachers were female \n(Table A5.2). This is due to a number of reasons: (i) low levels of qualification of lower and \nupper secondary female teachers, (ii) lack of training opportunities, (iii) lack of teachers in \nremote and rural areas due to safety concerns, (iv) difficult logistics (e.g., inadequate housing, \n                                                 \n4  MoEYS. 2006.

Legal Framework and Regulations \n \n8.  The Government aims to achieve 9-year basic schooling for all children by 2015 and \nimplement  its  Education  Sector  Plan  (ESP)  2006\u20132010,  emphasizing  equitable  access  to \neducation services, quality and efficiency of education services and institutional development, \nand capacity building for decentralization. The Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency sets out Cambodia\u2019s strategy on education. In particular, the \nstrategy  targets  enhancing  human  resources  with  high  technical  and  scientific  skills  that \neffectively respond to the labor market. The National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \ntargets education as one of the important vehicles for poverty reduction in the country. The \nNational Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 endorses the ESP 2006\u20132010, and includes \npoints related to the development of the teaching workforce. The Education for All (EFA) national \nplan highlights the importance of addressing gender issues at all levels and within all subsectors \nof the education system.7 The Cambodia Millennium Development Goal states the target of \nimproving the ratio of girls to boys in upper secondary education from 48% in 2001 to 100% in \n2015. \n \n9.  The draft Education Law emphasizes gender equity in education, as indicated in its goal \nand direction of education (Article 2), and more specifically in educational services (Article 41): \n(i)  Article 41 (Quality EFA). School or educational establishments provide instruction \nthat is appropriate to each learner\u2019s learning needs, abilities, and learning styles, and \ninstruction that is active, co-operative, learner-friendly, and gender-sensitive.  \n                                                 \n7  Secretary General of National Education For All. 2003.

School learning environment is \u2026 welcoming, gender-\nsensitive, disability-responsive, comfortable and safe. \n \n10.  The Gender Policy in Education (2006) goes further and indicates in its policy statement \nthe following six areas of support (i) gender is integrated into all aspects of education plans and \nprograms, (ii) an enabling environment for gender mainstreaming and positive social attitudes \ntowards gender equality and girls\u2019 education are created, (iii) gender equity in education is \nachieved and girls have full and equal access to education of good quality, (iv) women\u2019s \nparticipation in the management and delivery of education services is increased, (v) women will \nbe given equal treatment to men in the workplace, and (vi) gender mainstreaming actions must \ncomply with quality standards. MoEYS proposes a variety of strategies for implementing the \ngender  policy:  (i)  research  and  data  collection,  information  dissemination,  and  awareness \nraising; (ii) advocacy; (iii) capacity building; (iv) teaching and learning processes; (v) affirmative \nactions; (vi) partnerships with the Government, nongovernment organizations, or the private \nsector;  and  (vii)  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Project  reflects  these  key  government \ncommitments on gender equity in quality secondary education. \n \nD.  Gender Action Plan \n \n11.

The economic analysis addresses two important dimensions: (i) benefit-cost analysis, \nand (ii) fiscal impact and sustainability analysis.  \n \nA.  Economic and Policy Justifications \n \n2.  Public investment at all levels of education in Cambodia during the last 7 years has \nbeen substantial. Increased government and household spending on education at all levels \nhas had a direct impact on access and participation. During this same period, enrolments in \nprimary schools, lower secondary schools, and upper secondary schools have increased \nsubstantially. The Government\u2019s long-term goal is to develop a sustainable and competitive \neconomy  in  Cambodia.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and \nEfficiency reflects the Government's determination and commitment in this regard. One of \nthe  four  important  pillars  of  the  strategy  is  capacity  building  and  human  resource \ndevelopment,  in  which  enhancing  education  quality  has  been  identified  as  the  key  to \nachieving the long-term goal of developing a sustainable and competitive economy. The \nstrategy has been acting as a base guide for establishing (and revising) the Education for All \n(EFA) plan, Education Strategic Plan (ESP), Education Sector Support Program (ESSP), all \nof which are consistently working towards achieving long-term EFA goals (2015) by ensuring \nequitable  access  to  basic  and  postbasic  education,  enabling  quality  and  efficiency \nimprovement, and capacity building for decentralization. \n \n3.  While significant resources and attention have been directed to all education levels \n(particularly the basic level, grades 1\u20139), improved access and quality in the education \nsector as a whole remain critical. This is even more critical for the secondary education level, \nwhere students must obtain adequate knowledge and skills to align with the increased \ndemands (in number and quality) of the labor market.1 The socioeconomic, political, cultural, \nand labor-market climate of the country calls for improvement of education quality, including \n(i) preservice and in-service teacher training, (ii) physical school conditions and facilities, (iii) \ncurriculum development and teaching methods, (iv) adequate provision of textbooks for \nstudents and instructional materials for teachers, and (v) efficient education management \nsystems, i.e., quality staff and infrastructure at all education administrative levels.  \n \n4.  Cambodia became the 148th member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 13 \nOctober 2004. Like all least-developed countries, Cambodia's objective of WTO accession is \nto seek to leverage the benefits of trade. In this area, Cambodia is not only the first least-\ndeveloped country to have acceded to the WTO, but is also a champion in mainstreaming \ntrade  in  development  strategies.  As  Cambodia  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  garment \nexporters over the last 8 years, trade is at the centre of the country\u2019s Socio-economic \nDevelopment Plan, Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the Governance Action Plan to ensure \nCambodia develops a sustainable and competitive economy. To achieve a sustainable \ngrowth path and to survive in a globally competitive environment, Cambodia needs to build a \ndynamic human resource base with adaptable skills. Investment under the Project consists \nof improving quality, promoting access and participation, and increasing the efficiency and \neffectiveness  of  education  management  through  (i)  preservice  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining,  (ii)  physical  school  conditions  and  facilities,  (iii)  curriculum  development  and \nteaching  methods,  (iv)  adequate  provision  of  textbooks  for  students  and  instructional \nmaterials for teachers, (v) scholarship and incentive schemes, (vi) improved fiscal transfers, \n(vii) management training, and (viii) improvement of education management systems. The \nProject is expected to yield substantial economic, social, and institutional benefits. \n \n                                                 \n1  According to the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey, 2004, only 4% of the labor force in 2004 has upper \nsecondary or postsecondary education. \n ", "     Appendix 10           63\nB.  Benefit \u2013 Cost Analysis \n \n1.  Labor Market Demand \n \n5.  The  total  population  at  the  end  of  2006  was  estimated  at  14  million  people, \nincreasing from 11 million people in 1994. With an average annual growth rate of 1.8%, the \npopulation is projected to increase to over 15 million people in 2010. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita is $385 in 2005, up from $288 in 2000. About three quarters (74.2%) of the \nemployed population work in agriculture, 18.8% work in the service sector, and only 7% work \nin the manufacturing sector. Only 0.2% of workers are an employer (or self-employed), and \n13% are paid employees. Most of the workers are self employed or unpaid family workers. \nCambodia's labor force in 2006 was 7.6 million, or 54% of the total population. As children \naged 0\u20136 years are not considered to be economically active, and only a small percentage \nof those aged 7\u201314 years are in the labor force, the labor force participation rate is higher \nwhen only older ages are considered. Thus, 65.5% of the population aged 7 years and over, \nand 83.7% of the population aged 15 years and over, are economically active.  \n \n6.  The  labor  market  in  Cambodia  continues  to  consist  of  predominantly  unskilled, \nagricultural, or household workers. According to the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey \n2004, the educated and trained labor force comprised only 4% of employed persons (at the \ntechnical professional level). The labor market will continue to increase by 4.0% per annum, \nmeaning that every year another 300,000 people will enter the labor market. These are \nyoung, often unskilled workers with limited experience, who live in rural, remote, and often \ndisadvantaged areas where land and nonfarming jobs are rare. Those who will not be \nabsorbed by the formal sector will continue to work in household enterprises. If the private \nsector does not develop significantly, as planned by the Government, unemployment will \nincrease, especially as Government-owned enterprises and the agriculture sector employ \nfewer  people,  and  because  the  capacity  of  the  labor-intensive,  low-productivity  service \nsector is low. The Government, while reducing its monopoly in employment, has not invested \nsufficiently in retraining, which has been left to individual initiatives. \n \n7.  The transition to a market economy and rapid economic growth in the last 7 years \nhas raised the demand for skilled labor. Further growth promises to be more labor intensive. \nGiven its strong position and reputation in export processing, particularly garments and \ntextiles, Cambodia can double its exports and create around 1 million manufacturing jobs in \nexport sectors in the immediate future. To be competitive, however, Cambodia must develop \nthe high-technology sectors and upgrade its labor force. Secondary education is particularly \nimportant to foster the needed labor skills and the capacity to learn on the job while adapting \nto new technologies. Measures must mitigate the poverty and inequality that may worsen \nwith increasing globalization. Cambodia\u2019s comparative advantage is likely to be in (i) sectors \nand  enterprises  that  require  relative  shifts  in  the  skills  for  the  export  industry  export \nmanufacture, (ii) a steady increase in labor-intensive products, and (iii) a dramatic increase \nin  science-based  goods,  including  those  that  are  technologically  complex.  An  equally \nimportant issue recognized by the Government is the promotion of balanced development \nbetween  the  rich  and  poor  and/or  disadvantaged  regions.  A  large  number  of  recent \nprograms (both Government and donor initiatives) have been directed towards improving the \nsocioeconomic conditions of the poor, remote, and disadvantaged regions. Thus, education \naiming to improve labor skills for local economic development has been on the priority list.  \n \n2.  Project Benefits and Economic Rates of Return \n \n8.  Economic  benefits  will  potentially  include  high  social  returns  from  the  project \ninvestment  to  be  obtained  through  (i)  improvement  in  system  efficiency  through  better \ninfrastructure and personnel, and in allocation of resources; and (ii) improved productivity of \nupper secondary school graduates. \n ", "64  Appendix 10 \n  \n9.  In  terms  of  improvement  in  system  efficiency  through  better  infrastructure  and \npersonnel, and in allocation of resources, economic benefits will be achieved in a number of \nways. The economic benefits will be realized in the following five major ways. \n \n(i)  MoEYS staff, including provincial and district office staff, will receive technical \nassistance, training and support in planning, management, technical, and \nprofessional issues. They will be trained to strengthen their capacity to plan, \nmanage, administer, and regulate the system.  \n(ii)  Activities designed to improve preservice courses will directly and indirectly \nenhance quality of management and academic staff of NIE and TTCs, as well \nas teacher trainees, preparing them for a solid professional teaching career. \nAlso,  initiatives  to  improve  in-service  training  will  help  to  substantially \nenhance the quality of the majority of secondary school teachers.  \n(iii)  Upper  secondary  schools  will  be  improved  through  capacity  building  for \nschool management, school networking, and school improvement planning.  \n(iv)  The  Project  will  support  physical  and  technical  improvements  to  the \nmanagement  information  systems  (MISs)  including  the  education  MIS, \nfinance  MIS,  human  resource  MIS,  and  school  construction  MIS.  The \nsynchronization of the existing MIS subsets will improve the monitoring and \nplanning  capacity  of  MoEYS.  This  will  facilitate  timely  and  correct \nmanagement decisions, which will minimize wastage from both capital and \nrecurrent spending perspectives.  \n(v)  Efficiency  will  be  enhanced  through  project  investment  in  new  and \nrehabilitated infrastructure such as learning resource centers and dormitories, \nlibrary books, learning equipment for TTCs and upper secondary schools, \nupper  secondary  school  textbooks,  and  instructional  materials  for  upper \nsecondary school teachers.  \n \n10.  The economic benefits to be achieved as analyzed in the preceding list will be \nderived from the internal system efficiency of the education system by reducing the unit cost \nof producing a graduate. It is assumed that the cost saving is based on the minimum rate of \n0.5% of annual recurrent expenditure of the education sector and that such a saving will \nbegin to yield in year 3 of the project implementation. Based on these assumptions, the \naverage annual cost saving is $0.98 million. \n \n11.  With  regard  to  improved  productivity  of  upper  secondary  school  graduates,  the \nProject is expected to contribute to the national effort to increase the number of annual \nsecondary  school  graduates  (more  precisely,  upper  secondary  graduates)  by  financing \nimproved access to, and quality of, education. Under the project interventions, students in \nlower secondary and upper secondary schools, both currently and in the future, will be \ntaught by better trained and better motivated  teachers (and hence there will be lower \nrepetition and drop out rates) and will have more relevant attitudes, skills, and knowledge, \nand therefore be more employable. In this regard, the Project will directly improve the quality \nof outcomes and performance of graduates in the labor market. The Project will provide \nways to raise academic standards and help improve the alignment between graduate skills \nand the labor market. Increased earning capacity and spending ability of low-income groups \nwill help reduce poverty incidence in Cambodia. \n \n12.  Project economic benefits derived from the improved productivity of upper secondary \nschool graduates is often called productivity differential\u2014benefits from increased earnings or \ninflows. The quality enhancement measures are expected to increase earnings of new \ngraduates based on better skills and knowledge that they will receive as a result of the \nproject investment. Benefits will come from increased earnings because better-qualified \n ", "     Appendix 10           65\nteachers, pedagogical approaches, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure will help improve \nstudent performance and thus improve the quality of graduates and the labor force. \n \n13.  Expected  benefits  from  productivity  differential  are  also  based  on  the  expected \nminimum and indicate an estimated annual benefit of $8.62 million.  \n \n14.   The approach used in the above benefit quantification is to estimate minimum benefit \nthat  can  be  expected  from  the  proposed  investment  in enhancing education  quality  in \nCambodia. The aggregated minimum benefit and cost for the Project are outlined in Table \nA10.1. Where possible, the expected benefits have been summarized in monetary terms, \neither as cost savings (such as producing the same output at a reduced overall cost) and \nincreased  earnings  (such  as  producing  more  graduates  who  earn  more  due  to  better \neducation and/or contribution to the local economy). In all cases, these benefits exclude \nexternalities that accrue to the Project. Using a discount rate of 12% as the economic \nopportunity cost of capital, the economic analysis yield an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 22.4%, and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.53 in the base case. The Project is assessed \neconomically viable.  \n \nTable A10.1: Benefit-Cost Analysis, Base Case \nSerial No.  Year  Benefit Streama  Cost Streamb  Net Cash Flow \n1  2008  0.00  7.68  (7.68) \n2  2009  0.00  7.15  (7.15) \n3  2010  3.14  6.86  (3.72) \n4  2011  4.29  5.44  (1.15) \n5  2012  5.63  2.58  3.05 \n6  2013  7.26  0.95  6.32 \n7  2014  9.03  1.47  7.56 \n8  2015  10.99  1.47  9.52 \n9  2016  12.95  1.47  11.48 \n10  2017  14.92  1.47  13.45 \n11  2018  16.89  1.47  15.42 \n12  2019  18.86  1.47  17.39 \n13  2020  20.84  1.47  19.37 \n        EIRR \n  NPV@ 12%  39.52  25.90  22.4% \n  BCR  1.53     \na Benefit stream includes (i) annual cost savings due to increased system efficiency; and (ii) annual \nproductivity differential. \nb Costs are economic costs derived from financial costs applying a standard conversion factor of 0.95 \nfor Cambodia. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n15.  A sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the base-case model. \nFive sensitive cases are examined: (i) benefit decrease of 10%, (ii) cost increase of 10%, (iii) \nbenefit decrease of 10% and cost increase of 10%, (iv) benefit delay of 1 year, and (v) \nbenefit delay of 2 years.

The EIRR is identified to be highly sensitive to the benefit delays. In the case of a \nbenefit delay of 1 year, the benefit-cost ratio is reduced from 1.53 to 1.20, EIRR is reduced \nfrom 22.4% to 15.8%, and the economic net present value is 49.9% lower. In the case of a \nbenefit delay of 2 years, the benefit-cost ratio is reduced from 1.53 to 0.92, EIRR is reduced \nfrom 22.4% to 10.3% (or 1.7% lower than the 12% threshold), and the economic net present \nvalue is 92.2% lower, suggesting that a benefit delay of 2 years would make the Project \neconomically unviable.  \n \n17.  Based on this analysis, it is recommended that MoEYS (the executing agency), \nclosely follows the agreed project implementation schedule to ensure project benefits are \nrealized as scheduled. It further implies that the factors delaying project implementation \nshould be well under control and minimized to ensure the project economic viability and \nsustainability.  \n \nC.  Fiscal Impact and Sustainability Analysis \n \n18.  The fiscal impact of the Project is important as it helps assess the sustainability level. \nIn  practice,  education  projects  often  support  recurrent  expenditures  as  well  as  capital \noutlays, thus making the recurrent cost sustainability issue one of central importance for the \neconomic analysis. The impact on the overall budget once the Project is completed often \ndetermines whether the Project objectives will be sustained in the long run. A key issue to be \naddressed includes what impacts the investment in the project will have on fiscal indicators \nsuch as total annual budget, and capital and recurrent expenditure for the education sector \nin Cambodia during and after the implementation period of the Project.  \n \n19.  The Project has been designed bearing in mind that recurrent costs should be \nminimized for the Government and the community. The improvement of the quality support \nsystems under the Project is intended to reduce wastage, improve the internal efficiency of \nthe education sector (with a particular focus on the secondary education level), and reduce \nthe cost of producing an upper secondary school graduate in Cambodia. The incremental \nrecurrent Project costs arise largely from increased access to secondary schooling through \nenhanced quality and relevance. The costs of civil works and learning facilities have been \nminimized  by  using  efficient  designs  and  maximizing  the  utilization  of  locally  available \nresources and materials. Although new construction and rehabilitation works are being \nfinanced, sustainability is being ensured by the Government\u2019s commitment to operate and \nmaintain facilities after the project implementation period. \n \n20.  The total financial cost of the Project, inclusive of taxes, duties, contingencies, and \ninterest charges, is $33.40 million for an implementation period of 5 years. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance 81%, and the Government will finance the remainder. \nThe analysis indicates that the Project will have negligible impact on the state budget for the \neducation sector. The recurrent expenditure to be paid by the Government after the project \nimplementation is estimated to be $1.47 million per annum and includes incremental staff \nremuneration, operation and maintenance costs of civil works, facilities, equipment, and \nvehicles procured under the Project. It is indicated that the project recurrent expenditure \nafter project implementation (2014\u20132020) will only account for an average of 0.58% of \nannual recurrent expenditure allocated to the education sector during the 2014\u20132020 period. \nIt is observed that this proportion will be much smaller than the threshold of 5.0%. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071102094459+08'00'", "Author": "ESR", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071218123105+08'00'", "Title": "Enhancing Education Quality Project"}}
