INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2011 country programming review mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  pilot  implementation  of  a  drought  management \nstrategy.1 In August 2012, a fact-finding mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding \nwith the government on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, output, cost estimates and financing \nplan, implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has a long history of fatalities and property damage from floods and droughts. \nTo establish a national flood management strategy and implement the strategy in the provinces, \nADB  provided  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  with  TA  projects  for  the  Flood \nManagement Strategy Study2 and for Implementing the National Flood Management Strategy.3 \n \n3.  Regarding  drought,  the  PRC  faces  intensifying  pressure  on  water  resources  from \ncontinued economic development, population growth, urbanization, and climate change. Water \nscarcity is causing conflict and competition between water users, and relatively small changes in \nrainfall are having increasing large impacts on supply availability. Maintaining food security and \nsocial stability is very important in the PRC, and worsening drought and water scarcity affect \nboth. From 2006 to 2011, droughts cost the PRC CNY54.6 billion\u2013CNY150.9 billion per year in \ndirect economic losses, amounting to 0.17%\u20130.46% of the gross domestic product. From 1950 \nto  2011,  drought  annually  affected  an  average  of  214,700  square  kilometers  of  farmland, \nreducing grain production by an average of 16.2 million tons. From 1991 to 2011, droughts \nannually inflicted water shortages on an average of 27.8 million people. \n \n4.  About 60.7 million people experienced drinking water shortages during a severe drought \nin 2000 and 2001 that affected more than 620 cities and towns in 18 provinces, driving water \nsupplies  dangerously  low,  especially  in  large  cities.  The  2-year  drought  reduced  grain \nproduction by 114.7 million tons, raising concerns about food security in the PRC. In 2006, the \nPRC again suffered a severe drought, inflicting water shortages to 35.8 million people and \nreducing grain production by 41.7 million tons. From 2009 to 2010, an unusually severe drought \nspread across an area of southwestern PRC as large as western Europe and forced 20 million \npeople to line up for drinking water.   \n \n5.  The  national,  provincial,  and  local  governments  have  established  their  drought-\nmanagement plans, guidelines, rules, and regulations, such as drought relief guidelines and \nemergency  plans.  The  major  shortcoming  of  these  measures  has  been  that  drought-relief \nactions are generally passive responses to crises caused by droughts. Although the PRC has \nmade remarkable strides toward coping with drought by building water conservation structures \nand irrigation systems, this approach can adversely affect water cycles, ecosystems, and the \nenvironment. Generally, as drought impacts become more severe, the traditional approach of \nusing structural measures becomes less practical or economically feasible. Structural measures \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 September 2012. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "2   \ncannot meet all requirements for drought management, and other measures such as drought \nmonitoring, forecasting and warning, and water conservation have yet to be developed. \n \n6.  To  systematically  and  comprehensively  assess  existing  drought  management  and \nestablish an integrated drought management strategy, ADB provided the MWR with TA for the \nStrategy  for  Drought  Management.4 This  TA  produced  a  national  strategic  framework  for \ndrought management and an action plan for implementing integrated drought management. \nBased on these TA outputs, the MWR prepared a national anti-drought plan that included a \ndrought management strategy and an action plan.5  Managing drought risk is the principle of this \nplan. A knowledge product on drought management incorporating lessons learned from the TA \nwas published.6   \n \n7.  The key recommendation of the TA was to shift from reactive emergency response to \nproactive risk management. To achieve this, the TA recommended that (i) flood control and \ndrought relief headquarters (FCDRHs) take a leading role in proactive drought risk management, \nand (ii) FCDRHs undergo institutional and organizational reform and capacity development. \nDuring flood and drought emergencies, national and lower-level FCDRHs command operations, \nemergency responses, and post-disaster recovery. The national Office of the State FCDRH is \nlocated in the MWR. The offices of river basin FCDRHs are located in river basin commissions, \nprovincial FCDRHs in provincial departments of water resources (DWRs), and city and county \nFCDRHs in city or county bureaus of water resources.  \n \n8.  Following the recommendations of the TA, the government requested that a new TA be \nprovided to pilot and develop tools for managing drought risk, strengthen the capacity of officials \ninvolved in drought management, prepare a detailed and tailored plan to manage drought risk \nfor  each  pilot  province,  and  prepare  guidelines  for  implementing  the  national  drought \nmanagement strategy across the PRC. Gansu, Liaoning, and Sichuan will be the pilot provinces, \nas they have been seriously affected by drought and offer a range of locations that allow scaling \nup the piloted and developed models and methodologies. \n \n9.  The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 supports the long-term goal of building a \nharmonious and moderately prosperous society through livelihood improvement and regionally \nbalanced and environmentally sustainable growth. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u2013\n2015 for the PRC supports this social goal by focusing on three strategic pillars: inclusive \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration.7 As the \nTA will help the government implement the national drought management strategy, it aligns with \nthe PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy to improve livelihoods \nand promote inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. The TA aligns with the priorities \nof ADB\u2019s water policy by promoting a national focus on water sector reform and fostering the \nintegrated management of water resources.8 The TA is also consistent with the key pillar of \nADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security in Asia and Pacific in improving the \nresilience  of  the  agriculture  and  rural  sectors  against  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and \nassociated climate variability and food price volatility.9  \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2009.

The impact of the TA will be improved and sustained drought management in the PRC. \nThe outcome of the TA will be changes in drought management from reactive emergency \nresponse to proactive risk management demonstrated in the three pilot provinces. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The expected output of the TA will be strengthened capacity in FCDRHs in three pilot \nprovinces to manage drought risk. Specifically, the TA will produce  (i) tools for managing \ndrought risk; (ii) a program of institutional and capacity development for managing drought risk \nand saving water, and an educational and public awareness program for water saving; (iii) a \ndetailed and tailored plan for managing drought risk in each pilot province; and (iv) guidelines \nfor implementing the national drought management strategy across the PRC. \n \n12.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months.  To  the  end  of  the  second  month, \nconsultants will (i) review past and ongoing  national and provincial activities for managing \ndrought risk and saving water, and assess their outcomes for inclusion in the pilots; (ii) survey \nstaff of FCDRHs in national and other government administrations and staff of other agencies to \nassess their understanding of drought risk management; and (iii) survey water users in the three \npilot provinces to assess their understanding of water saving and measures toward introducing \nwater-saving mechanisms.  \n \n13.  To the end of the ninth month, the consultants will (i) develop a mechanism to collect \ndata for drought management, including agency cooperation; (ii) develop a comprehensive \ndatabase for drought management in the three pilot provinces; (iii) establish methodologies for \nanalyzing drought hazards and mapping drought risk by mapping the likelihood and severity of \ndrought in the three pilot provinces; (iv) conduct scenario analyses in the three pilot provinces \nidentifying priority areas for drought management with the greatest benefit, and establish a \nmethodology for  analysis;  (v)  develop  a  drought forecasting  system; (vi)  develop  an  early \nwarning mechanism to guide decisions on water availability and control; and (vii) hold provincial \nworkshops on these tools for managing drought risk.  \n \n14.  To the end of the 16th month, the consultants will (i) prepare for agencies a program of \ninstitutional and capacity development for managing drought risk and saving water, as well as \nan educational and public awareness program for water users on saving water that considers \nthe roles of FCDRHs in national and other government administrations and of other agencies in \nmanaging drought risk and saving water and how to spur cooperation between agencies; (ii) \nimplement part of the institutional and capacity development program in the three pilot provinces; \n(iii) conduct an international study tour for the staff of the MWR and DWRs of the three pilot \nprovinces; (iv) develop, based on pilot activities, a plan for managing drought risk that is tailored \nto the specific issues of each pilot province; (v) prepare guidelines for implementing drought risk \nmanagement  across  the  PRC;  and  (vi)  hold  national  and  provincial  workshops  on  the \ninstitutional and capacity development program, the education and public awareness program, \nprovincial plans for managing drought risk, and the drought risk management implementation \nguidelines. \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources);  and  $200,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund10 under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and will be administered by ADB. Funding from the Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund will be used for specific activities shown in Appendix 2. \n  \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation; \ndomestic transportation, remuneration, and per diem for counterpart staff; and other in-kind \ncontributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MWR, including the national Office of the State FCDRH, will be the executing \nagency for the TA. The MWR is responsible for administering water resources throughout the \nPRC and has shown strong capacity to execute ADB-assisted projects, such as the Yellow \nRiver Flood Management Sector Project,11 the Flood Management Strategy Study (footnote 2), \nImplementing  the  National  Flood  Management  Strategy  (footnote  3),  and  the  Strategy  for \nDrought Management (footnote 4). The respective DWRs, including the FCDRH offices of the \nthree pilot provinces\u2014Gansu, Liaoning, and Sichuan\u2014will be the implementing agencies. \n \n18.  A TA management office (TMO) will be established in the MWR to administer the day-to-\nday  activities  of  the  TA  and  coordinate  with  ADB  and  the  three  pilot  provinces.  A  TA \nimplementation  office  will  be  established  in  each  DWR. The  MWR  and  DWRs  will  assign \nexperienced full-time staff to serve as the directors of the TMO and the TA implementation \noffices, as well as counterpart staff to work closely with TA consultants. The MWR and DWRs \nwill provide office space, access to communications and copiers, and logistical support for TA \nimplementation. The director of the TMO will manage and liquidate funds provided by ADB and \nthe government for training, seminars, and conferences. \n \n19.  A steering committee will be established under the MWR to guide TA implementation. \nThe steering committee members will be senior representatives of the MWR, including the \nnational Office of the State FCDRH; the DWRs, including the FCDRH offices of the three pilot \nprovinces;  and  other  agencies  of  the  three  pilot  provinces,  including  the  departments  of \nagriculture, housing and urban\u2013rural development, and meteorology. The steering committee \nwill meet at the inception, interim, midterm, and final stages of TA implementation and when \nimportant outputs of the TA are produced. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, tentatively starting on 8 January 2013 and \nending on 11 July 2014. Substantial time will be devoted to surveys, fieldwork, workshops, and \ncapacity development. The consultants will submit an inception report within 4 weeks of TA \ncommencement and an interim report 9 months after TA commencement. A draft final report will \nbe submitted 16 months after TA commencement, and a final report at TA conclusion. The \ninception, interim, and draft final reports will be subject to review by ADB and the government. \n                                                \n10  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n11 ADB. 2001.

To  systematically  and  comprehensively  assess  existing  drought  management  and \nestablish an integrated drought management strategy, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprovided  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  with  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA) for the Strategy for Drought Management. The key recommendation of this TA \nwas to shift from reactive emergency response to proactive risk management. Based on the \noutputs of the TA, the MWR prepared a national anti-drought plan that included a drought \nmanagement strategy and an action plan. Managing drought risk is the principle of this plan.  \n2.  Following the recommendations of the TA, the government requested that a new TA be \nprovided to pilot and develop tools for managing drought risk, strengthen the capacity of officials \ninvolved in drought management, prepare a detailed and tailored plan to manage drought risk \nfor  each  pilot  province,  and  prepare  guidelines  for  implementing  the  national  drought \nmanagement strategy across the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Gansu, Liaoning, and \nSichuan will be the pilot provinces, as they have been seriously affected by drought and offer a \nrange of locations that allow scaling up the piloted and developed models and methodologies. \nB.  Reporting Requirements \n3.  The consultants will submit an inception report within 4 weeks of TA commencement, an \ninterim report  9 months  after TA  commencement,  a  draft final  report  16  months  after TA \ncommencement, and a final report at TA conclusion.  \n4.  The inception, interim, and draft final reports will be subject to review by ADB and the \ngovernment. All reports will be written in English and translated into Chinese. Five copies of \neach report in English will be submitted to ADB, and five copies in both Chinese and English will \nbe submitted to the MWR. \n5.  The inception report will present an approach for the TA, including a work plan and an \nimplementation schedule. The interim report will present (i) past and ongoing international, \nnational, and provincial activities for managing drought risk and saving water and assessment of \nthe outcome for inclusion in the pilots; (ii) the results of surveys of staff of the flood control and \ndrought relief headquarters (FCDRHs) of the national and other government administrations and \nof  other  relevant  agencies,  including  assessment  of  their  understanding  of  drought  risk \nmanagement; (iii) the results of water user surveys in the three pilot provinces, including the \nassessment of their understanding of water saving and measures for introducing water-saving \nmechanisms;  (iv)  a  mechanism  to  collect  data  for  drought  management,  including  agency \ncooperation; (v) the development of a comprehensive database for drought management in the \nthree pilot provinces; (vi) methodologies for analyzing drought hazard and mapping drought risk; \n(vii)  scenario  analyses  of  the  three  pilot  provinces  identifying  priority  areas  for  drought \nmanagement with the greatest benefit, and a methodology for analysis; (viii) the development of \na drought forecasting system; and (ix) the development of an early warning mechanism to guide \ndecisions on water availability and control.  \n6.  The draft final report will cover (i) the contents of the interim report; (ii) the roles of the \nFCDRHs in national and other government administrations and of other agencies in managing \ndrought risk and saving water and how to spur cooperation; (iii) a program for agencies on \ninstitutional  and  capacity  development  for  managing  drought  risk  and  saving  water;  (iv)  a \nsummary and the results of implementation of part of the institutional and capacity development \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nprogram in the three pilot provinces; (v) an educational and public awareness program for water \nusers on saving water; (vi) a summary and the results of an international study tour for the staff \nof the MWR and the departments of water resources (DWRs) of the three pilot provinces; (vii) a \nplan for managing drought risk based on pilot activities that is tailored to address the specific \nissues in each pilot province; and (viii) guidelines for implementing drought risk management \nacross the PRC.
