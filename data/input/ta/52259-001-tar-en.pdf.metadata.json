INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strategy 2030, the long-term corporate strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nrecognizes the distinct development challenges of small island developing states (SIDS) and \nfragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  (FCAS),  and  promotes  a  differentiated  approach  to \noperations in these groups of developing member countries (DMCs).1 In line with Strategy 2030, \nthe technical assistance (TA) will support the integration of a differentiated approach to ADB\u2019s \noperations in the urban sector across the Pacific region. The TA will focus on strengthening the \nresilience of urban areas in Pacific SIDS and FCAS by addressing the root causes of their \nvulnerability and fragility, including low institutional capacities for planning and managing urban \ndevelopment. The TA will help SIDS and FCAS adopt a longer-term horizon for planning, and \nsupport  governments  to  prepare  a  more  programmatic  and  multisector  approach  to  urban \ninfrastructure investments in 3\uf02d4 countries.2 Particular attention will be given to institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development with emphasis on learning by doing. The TA will also \nhelp strengthen regional coordination and integration by supporting regional studies, reinforcing \nexisting networks, and establishing new ones. This will bolster earlier proactive collaboration in \nproject development, help ADB tailor its approaches and processes to the needs and constraints \nof SIDS and FCAS, and enable stronger resilience and sustainability of urban centers in the \nPacific. \n \n2.  On 19 November 2018, ADB approved the concept paper for this TA, with a budget of \n$3,000,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).3 The TA is in \nline with the implementation priorities of the Pacific Approach, 2016\uf02d2020 and is included in the \nregional operations business plan, 2019\uf02d2021 for the Pacific.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Pacific SIDS and FCAS face daunting obstacles to development\u2014isolation from markets, \ngeographic dispersion, small populations, constrained natural resources, and the high risk of \ndisaster triggered by natural hazards. Strategy 2030 sets the course to respond effectively to the \nchanging development needs and challenges in Asia and the Pacific. Under it, ADB will sustain \nits efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and expand its vision to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, \nresilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific. The strategy recognizes the distinct development \nchallenges of SIDS and FCAS and outlines ADB\u2019s differentiated approach to these DMCs. \nStrategy 2030 contains commitments to providing long-term financing and capacity development \nassistance to help build resilience and address causes of vulnerability. ADB support prioritizes \ninstitutional development and governance reforms, essential infrastructure and social services, \ntargeted social assistance, climate change adaptation, environmental sustainability, and disaster \nrisk management.  \n \n4.  Development experience elsewhere has shown that urban centers can be the drivers of \neconomic growth\u2014through trade links, growth of the private sector, job creation, and social \nservice  provision.  However,  this  has  not  been  the  case  in  the  Pacific,  where,  although \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. ADB follows the United Nations\u2019 definition of SIDS, which defines SIDS as all states that participate in the \nAlliance of Small Island States. Therefore, all 14 Pacific ADB DMCs are classified as SIDS. \n2  The pilot cities and DMCs will be most likely selected from the following group: (i) Nadi and Suva in Fiji; (ii) South \nTarawa, Kiribati; (iii) Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; (iv) Dili, Timor-Leste; (v) Honiara, Solomon Islands; and \n(vi) Port Vila, Vanuatu. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2018. \n4  ADB. 2017. Pacific Approach, 2016\uf02d2020. Manila; and ADB. 2018. Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific, \n2019\uf02d2021. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nurbanization is happening at a fast rate, strong economic growth did not follow. In 2017, 7 out of \n14 Pacific DMCs had the majority of their populations residing in urban areas. The United Nations \nprojected that the number of people living in urban areas in the 14 DMCs will increase from \n2.4 million in 2017 to 3.4 million in 2030, to 6.0 million by 2050.5 Yet, of the 2.4 million residing in \nurban areas in 2017, more than 1 million lived in informal settlements, often without basic services \nsuch as potable water or sanitation and with limited access to economic opportunities.6 The \ninability of states to match service provision with growing urban populations is also a major \nchallenge to internal resilience. With urban populations growing faster than national populations \nand youth unemployment being a major problem in most Pacific cities, the potential for urban \nunrest and conflict is considerable.7 The civil conflict in Solomon Islands from 1998 to 2003 had \nits origins in the rural\uf02durban migration and unresolved land ownership issues. Tonga experienced \nrioting in its capital in 2006, while Port Moresby is afflicted by an increase in violent crimes. \n \n5.  Poorly planned and managed urban centers constrain growth, prevent the achievement \nof the Sustainable Development Goals, and contribute to the fragility of Pacific nations caused by \na myriad problems\u2014trade and transport congestion, unreliable energy supply, lack of formal \nsector job growth, limited access to housing, inadequate basic urban infrastructure services, poor \nquality of social services, and red tape constraining business growth. The lack of consultative \nlong-term planning; insufficient capacity to prepare, finance, manage, and coordinate urban \ninvestments; and an ad hoc approach to the development of infrastructure are undermining urban \ndevelopment in the Pacific. These factors are a major constraint to achieving Strategy 2030\u2019s \noperational priority of more livable cities. The ad hoc approach to urban development further \nincreases the vulnerability of urban communities to climate change, disaster triggered by natural \nhazards, and economic shocks. \n \n6.  ADB has been scaling up its assistance to SIDS and FCAS in the Pacific, working with the \npublic and private sectors to enable sustainable and resilient urban designs, climate-proof \ninfrastructure, improve power supply, and build efficient and safe transport networks. However, \nproject success rates in the Pacific remain considerably lower than for ADB overall\u201453% of \ncompleted projects in the Pacific were rated successful in 2014\uf02d2017, compared with 75% of all \nADB sovereign projects in the same period.8 Ensuring that the outputs and outcomes of ADB-\nfinanced Pacific operations are sustainable remains a critical challenge, since only 45% of \ncompleted projects were rated likely sustainable in 2014\uf02d2017. Lessons from the completed \noperations point to the need to ensure a more strategic approach to project selection and planning, \nstrengthen the capacity of planning and implementing agencies, improve the procurement and \ndesign readiness of operations, resolve land ownership issues in advance of project approval, \nand ensure sufficient attention to post-completion operation and maintenance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: resilience, productivity, and sustainability of \nurban centers in the Pacific strengthened.9 The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of \n                                                \n5  United Nations.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Long-term urban development strategies and capital investment plans for \npriority urban infrastructure and services formulated. The TA will support the preparation of \nurban development strategies in 3\uf02d4 Pacific DMCs. These strategies will take a long-term and \nhighly cross-sector-oriented, consultative approach to the development of urban areas and \nidentify investment needs for urban services such as water supply, sanitation, flood control, solid \nwaste management, urban transport, energy, health, and education. The strategies will be based \non comprehensive assessments and will tackle the root causes of vulnerability and fragility of \nurban settlements in the Pacific, including their vulnerability to climate change, disaster triggered \nby natural hazards, and economic shocks. They will build on the lessons and outputs of other TAs \nrelated to urban development in the Pacific and will consider opportunities for mainstreaming \ngender  and  Sustainable  Development  Goals.11 The  strategies  will  be  used  to  support  the \ndevelopment of integrated capital investment plans that identify high-priority projects over the \nmedium term in the urban areas in pilot DMCs.12 The investment plans will identify possible \nsources of financing, including cofinancing from development partners and the private sector. \nEfforts will focus on defining the most suitable modalities for assistance, such as programmatic \nor stand-alone approaches and appropriate financing instruments. To provide foundations for the \nimplementation of capital plans, the TA will also support the establishment of project readiness \nfinancing facilities in the pilot DMCs, building on the lessons from the Pacific Project Improvement \nAction Plan.13 The financial facilities will support feasibility studies for priority projects including \ncomprehensive  disaster  risk  and  climate  assessments,  due  diligence  with  social  and \nenvironmental risks assessments, and preliminary and detailed engineering designs; and will help \nformulate a pipeline of projects that are procurement-ready.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity development and institutional strengthening for urban planning \nand project development delivered. The TA will provide capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening to government counterparts responsible for urban planning and management in the \nareas  of  project  identification,  preparation,  financing,  implementation,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance; and to local contractors on ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines and procedures. A heavy \nemphasis will be placed on learning by doing. The TA will support business process reforms that \nare  tailored  to  the  needs  and  nature  of  ADB\u2019s  operation  in  the  Pacific  and  facilitate  the \nestablishment of national (i.e., country-based) registries of consultants (firms and individuals), \ncontractors, suppliers, and service providers working on ADB-financed operations. The registries \nwill be useful in building up a contracting service industry, with a focus on promoting businesses \nheaded by women.14  Institutional strengthening and capacity development programs will be \nbased on needs assessments to address chronic capacity gaps in the Pacific, and to facilitate the \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 ADB. 2017.

To overcome the logistical and resource constraints \nof reaching out to more participants, ADB will update and develop online learning courses that \ncater to different knowledge levels and provide on-demand learning opportunities. These efforts \nwill enable a more proactive collaboration in the early stage of project development and help ADB \ntailor approaches and processes to the needs and constraints of Pacific DMCs.  \n \n10.  Output  3:  Regional  networks  established  and  knowledge  products  to  support \nsustainable urban development produced. The TA will help find regional solutions to some \ntypical urban development challenges in the Pacific, such as small economies, remoteness, \nlimited institutional capacity, and vulnerability to climate change and economic, environmental, \nand disaster-related shocks. The TA will support regional studies on urgent issues related to \nurban development, such as the feasibility of developing a regional response to solid waste \nmanagement in the Pacific. It will also help strengthen regional networks such as the Pacific Water \nand Wastewater Association and, as needed, establish new networks (by promoting sustainably \ninclusive membership), such as among seaport or airport operators. This will facilitate cooperation \nbetween developing countries and permit effective exchange of experiences and knowledge in \nthese areas. The TA will also support pertinent regional events and provide trainers and resource \npersons to facilitate the work of the regional networks.  Opportunities to collaborate with regional \ninstitutions will be sought.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. The TA will cover the travel costs of ADB staff acting as resource persons for \nseminars and workshops. The TA budget may be increased during implementation subject to the \ndemand for the TA activities. \n \n12.  The governments of participating DMCs will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncountry data, counterpart staffing (if needed), office space for consultants, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  its  Pacific  Department  will  administer  and \nimplement the TA. The implementation will take 60 months, from 1 January 2019 to 31 December \n2023.  \n \n14.  The TA will disseminate knowledge through various platforms. It will input planned TA \noutputs  to  k-Nexus  to  build  on  ADB\u2019s  accumulated  knowledge  and  experience,  minimize \nduplication, and facilitate dissemination.15 To ensure continuous learning on urban planning and \nproject  development,  e-learning  courses  will  be  developed  to  provide  on-demand  learning \nopportunities. These courses may be hosted on existing ADB platforms for online learning to \nensure that they remain accessible beyond TA closure. In collaboration with ADB\u2019s Department \nof Communications, the assessments of urban settlements, urban development strategies, and \ninvestment  plans  will  be  disseminated  through  various  channels,  depending  on  the  target \naudience. All outputs will be made freely available to the public through ADB's corporate website. \nLimited copies will be produced for general dissemination and conduct targeted workshops in \nheadquarters, representative offices, and resident missions. \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2018. k-Nexus (accessed 15 November 2018). \n ", "5 \n \n15.  The TA will require 170 person-months of services by individual consultants as well as a \nfirm, i.e., 90 person-months of international and 80 person-months of national consulting services. \nThe exact requirements for each type of expertise and the length of engagement will vary \naccording to the scope of work and studies.
