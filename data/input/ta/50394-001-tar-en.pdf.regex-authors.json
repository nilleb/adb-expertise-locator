The  proposed  Skills  for  Competitiveness  Project  will  enhance  the  skills  and \ncompetitiveness of Cambodia\u2019s industrial sector labor force. Industry has been and will continue \nto be a key driver of the country\u2019s growth. The project will support the national priority of \nmodernizing and transforming Cambodia\u2019s industrial structure from labor-intensive to skills-driven \nby 2025. It will develop human resources in higher value-added industries by (i) strengthening \nselected public post-secondary technical training institutes (TTIs) in priority sectors and locations; \n(ii) promoting work-based learning programs to upskill the current workforce; and (iii) supporting \nthe government\u2019s planned skills development fund. Education is one of the core sectors of the \nAsian  Development  Bank (ADB)  in  Cambodia1 and  the  project  is  closely  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s development priorities.2 The project cost is estimated at $60.6 million, of which ADB \nwill finance $60 million through concessional ordinary capital resources. Both the ensuing loan \nand the transaction technical assistance (TA) are included in the Cambodia Country Operations \nBusiness Plan 2018\u20132020 (footnote 1).  \n  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n  Justification \n2.  The TA will help the government prepare an investment project. 3 The TA will review \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) policies, systems, performance, and \nconstraints in Cambodia\u2019s industrial sector to identify areas for ADB support to public post-\nsecondary skills development in growing sub-sectors. ADB\u2019s ongoing support for TVET policy \nreforms4 focuses on improving quality and expanding access to entry-level skills programs in line \nwith Cambodia\u2019s TVET Strategic Plan 2014\u20132018.5 The TA will develop the ensuing project in \naccordance with the priorities outlined in Cambodia\u2019s Industrial Development Policy 2015\u201320256 \nand the new National TVET Policy 2017\u20132025. After loan approval, the TA will provide continued \ntechnical support to the skills development fund pilot.  \n  Outputs and Activities  \n3.  The TA activities will contribute to three outputs: (i) determining the scope and coverage \nof the proposed project, (ii) completing the due diligence requirements, and (iii) preparing project \nimplementation arrangements. The TA will be implemented alongside a proposed knowledge and \nsupport technical assistance (KSTA) for piloting employment strategies, closely coordinating to \nensure synergy and avoid duplication.  \n4.  Output 1: Scope and coverage of the proposed project determined. The proposed \nproject aims to improve the quality of selected TTIs. To choose those that will participate in the \nproject, the TA will review selected TTIs and analyze ongoing programs, curriculum, teacher \nquality, links with industry, and students\u2019 level of knowledge and skills. The TA will undertake an \nindustrial sector labor market analysis and propose new TVET programs for selected institutes to \nbe financed by the loan. The TA will assess the need for new construction or expansion of existing \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia 2018\u20132020.

To promote work-based learning in the industrial sector, the TA consultants will conduct \nsurveys to identify the work-based learning needs of workers who are interested to update their \ntechnical and vocational skills by taking short courses offered by technical training institutes. The \nTA will collect basic data to inform work-based learning program development in several sectors \nunder the ensuing loan project, with the participation of skills councils. Once the partners are \nidentified, the project will help develop a tailored program in which employees can participate. \nThe TA will also identify what type of noncognitive and basic skills training current low-skilled \nworkers need. The TA will prepare the basic design of feasible work-based learning programs to \nbe financed by the loan, with a draft implementation plan.  \n6.  To support innovative TVET financing mechanisms the TA will closely review the Ministry \nof Economy and Finance (MEF) skills development fund pilot proposal and help develop a \ndetailed implementation plan and governance structures. The TA will consult with the private \nsector\u2014particularly firms in special economic zones and industrial parks\u2014to identify the major \nconstraints to Cambodia\u2019s participation in regional and global value chains and ascertain how \nsupport for industrial human resource development under the loan can address these. The TA \nwill  recommend  sector  studies  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  on  value  chains,  industry \ndiversification, and Cambodia\u2019s current and future labor market needs.  \n7.  Output 2: Due diligence requirements completed. To support loan preparation, the TA \nwill  deliver  (i)  economic  and  financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  loan;  (ii)  poverty,  gender \nmainstreaming,  and  safeguard  assessments  including  preparation  of  safeguard  documents \nrequired for the project to comply with ADB safeguard requirements (environment, resettlement, \nand indigenous people); (iii) procurement risk assessment, (iv) detailed design and monitoring \nframework targets and baseline values; and (v) analysis for other required linked documents as \nneeded. \n8.  Output 3: Project implementation arrangements prepared. TA consultants will provide \ntechnical support to the project management unit to improve readiness for project implementation, \ncoordinating closely with other ADB-financed capacity development initiatives involving MLVT (in \npublic financial management and project implementation, both managed by ADB\u2019s Cambodia \nResident Mission). The TA will prepare (i) a detailed civil works plan and list of equipment plus \nmaster  bidding  documents for the  loan\u2019s major  procurement  packages  and  (ii) the  project \nadministration manual.  \n  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,260,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1.

POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nUnder Cambodia\u2019s Industrial Development Policy 2015\u20132025, the Royal Government of Cambodia has set out \nindustrialization\u2014in particular, the modernization and transformation of industry from labor-intensive to skills-\ndriven\u2014as a long-term development goal, and includes the development of high quality human resources is a key \nstrategy to achieve this goal.  The government aims to enhance development of competitive labor which will directly \ncontribute to inclusive economic growth. The National Technical and Vocational Education and Training Policy 2017-\n2025 aims to improve the quality of TVET to meet national and international labor market demand, to increase \nequitable access to TVET, to promote private sector engagement to ensure relevance and sustainability, and to \nimprove governance of the TVET system. These four main goals support the vision of enhanced human resources \nwith the knowledge, skills, work attitude, and professional ethics for lifelong employability, productivity and \ncompetitiveness. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Cambodia County Partnership Strategy 2014\u20132018 prioritizes \neducation and TVET in support of Cambodia\u2019s goal of becoming an upper middle-income country.a \n \nB.     Poverty Targeting \nGeneral Intervention  Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc) \n \nThe proposed project will include low-skilled workers among the potential beneficiaries of new work-based learning \nprograms to upskill the existing industrial labor force. Low-skilled workers are among the country\u2019s most vulnerable, \nfinding themselves in low-paid, tenuous jobs at risk of retrenchment in times of recession or economic crisis.  \nC.  Poverty and Social Analysis\n \n1. Key issues and potential beneficiaries. \n \n2. Impact channels and expected systemic changes.  The expected impact of the project is that Cambodia\u2019s \nindustrial structure will transform from low-cost and labor-intensive industry to a skills-driven industry by 2025. The \nproject will contribute to increases in labor productivity and diversification of industries in Cambodia, which will result \nin the expansion of economic opportunities for men and women, and thus inclusive growth.   \n3. Focus of (and resources allocated in) the TRTA or due diligence.

The TRTA will include poverty, social and gender analysis.  \nII.  GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram? Key gender issues in post-secondary TVET include (i) limited access to and affordability of advanced \nskills training for women; and (ii) the limited number of female students who study science, technology, engineering \nand math subjects at the post-secondary level. To expand access of women to good quality TVET programs, the \nTRTA will identify obstacles to women\u2019s access to TVET institutions and propose mitigating measures. The project \nwill also explore women graduates\u2019 employment rates and propose measures to encourage women graduates to \nfind jobs in the industrial sector. The TA team\u2019s outputs specifically include a gender assessment report, gender \nmonitoring indicators for the project\u2019s design and monitoring framework, and a gender action plan to guide \nachievement of the gender targets. Project due diligence will include poverty, social and gender analysis to assess \nthe social impact of the proposed loan project in accordance with the Guidelines for Incorporation of Social \nDimensions in ADB Operations, identification of challenges and constraints to women\u2019s participation in post-\nsecondary TVET, collecting sex-disaggregated baseline data (data should also disaggregated by urban-rural and by \nincome); and developing specific gender design elements under each of the project\u2019s outputs.  \n \n2.
