During the Country Programming Mission in December 2007, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide advisory technical assistance (TA) for the utilization of foreign capital to promote energy \nconservation and energy-efficient power generation scheduling. The TA is included in the ADB \nnonlending pipeline for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for 2008.1 A Fact-Finding Mission \nfrom ADB visited the PRC during 5\u201312 October 2008 to discuss with the Government the \nimpacts,  outcomes,  scope  of  works,  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation \narrangement for the TA. This report is based on the understanding reached during the mission. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Energy Sector Development and Energy Efficiency. The PRC has Asia\u2019s largest and \nfastest-growing energy sector. While energy fuels economic growth and poverty reduction, \ninefficient energy use induces accelerated resource depletion and causes severe environmental \ndamage.  There  are  daunting  challenges  to  ensuring  that  ongoing  energy  growth  is  both \nenvironmentally sustainable and economically desirable. With a strong political commitment \ntowards improving energy conservation and addressing the negative impact of global climate \nchange, the Government has articulated a clear vision as reflected in its target of quadrupling \nper capita gross domestic product (GDP) while only doubling energy use during 2000\u20132020. \nThis requires that the energy elasticity of GDP growth is maintained at around 0.3 over the next \n12 years, i.e., the energy consumption increases at less than a third of the rate of economic \ngrowth.  \n \n3.  To  meet  this  serious  challenge,  the  Government  has  made  energy  efficiency \nimprovement its highest priority for the energy sector. The National Development and Reform \nCommission  (NDRC)  issued  the  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan2 in \nJanuary 2005. The 11th Five-Year Development Plan (2006\u20132010) requires a mandatory 20% \nenergy intensity reduction by 2010, which has been allocated to the provincial and municipal \nlevels. Ten key areas for energy savings have been identified, and 1,000 enterprises with \nintensive  energy  use  are  now  under  tight  supervision.  Meanwhile,  a  series  of  incentives, \nincluding energy efficiency funding and financial incentives, have been adopted to stimulate \nenergy efficiency activities. Structural adjustment, technological upgrade, improved demand-\nside management, and decommissioning of inefficient facilities (e.g., small and old thermal \npower plants) have been actively pursued.3 Barriers to energy efficiency include dissemination \nof information related to technology and incentives, and capacity of local government entities \nand officials. \n \n4.  Electricity Generation in the People's Republic of China. The PRC has been rapidly \nexpanding its electricity generation capacities to support fast economic growth and massive \nurbanization. By the end of 2007, the total installed generating capacity reached 718 gigawatts, \nof which 556 gigawatts (77.4%) was coal fired. The high use of coal for electricity generation \n(about 1.4 billion tons in 2007, which is the highest in the world) leads to severe pollution and \nvast greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about 40% of the country\u2019s carbon dioxide \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 September 2008.  \n2  NDRC. 2004. National Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan. Beijing. PRC. \n3  However, despite the reinforced efforts by the Government and enterprises, energy intensity reduction progressed \nrelatively slowly in 2006 (by 1.79%) and 2007 (by 3.66%), resulting in heavier challenges for the remaining years \n(2008\u20132010) of the 11th Five-Year Development Plan period.  \n ", "2   \nemission, 55% of its sulfur dioxide emission, 80% of it nitrogen oxide emission, and 23% of its \nparticulate emission.  \n \n5.  The overall efficiency of power generation is relatively low because of the large number \nof small and old power plants in operation; the average coal consumption for each kilowatt-hour \nof electricity generated was 356 grams of standard coal equivalent in 2007, which is about 50\u2013\n60 grams higher than in developed countries. However, the newly installed coal-fired generation \nunits (CGUs), which constitute over half the installed capacity and are of 300 megawatt capacity \nor more, have state-of-the-art control systems, optimized design, and efficient auxiliaries; their \npower generation efficiency is comparable to international practice. A higher utilization of the \nmodern units will significantly reduce coal consumption and pollution emissions.  \n \n6.  Need to Optimize the Power Generation Scheduling and Dispatch System in the \nPeople's Republic of China. The current power generation scheduling and dispatch system \n(GS&DS)4 in the PRC allows about the same utilization hours of large efficient CGUs and small \ninefficient CGUs, resulting in energy waste and excessive emissions. Further, the average \nannual utilization of CGUs was only 5,344 hours (61%) in 2007, which is considerably lower \nthan the 90% utilization of new CGUs, implying large potential for improvement. The NDRC has \nlaunched a new energy-efficient and environmentally friendly GS&DS initiative that maximizes \nthe use of renewable energy and ranks CGUs according to their marginal fuel uses in order to \nsignificantly reduce coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The guideline for pilot \nimplementation of the new GS&DS was approved by the State Council in August 2007. Five \nprovinces\u2014Guangdong,  Guizhou,  Henan,  Jiangsu,  and  Sichuan\u2014started  testing  the  new \nGS&DS at the end of 2007. \n \n7.  Consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategies.  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  aims  at  inclusive \neconomic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. In its long-term strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),5 ADB has identified energy as a core operational sector \nand achieving environmental sustainability as a strategic priority. ADB has also introduced new \ninitiatives to augment its assistance to developing member countries for acquiring low-carbon \ntechnologies and implementing energy efficiency projects. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC6 has also emphasized balanced and sustainable growth with more efficient uses of \nresources and more stringent protection of the environment.  \n \n8.  The PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Development Plan requires that financial assistance from \ninternational financial institutions be used for resource conservation, environmental protection, \nand  infrastructure  development.  There  are  several  provinces  with  satisfactory  project \nimplementation  track  records,  but  the  provincial  governments  lack  the  capacity  to  initiate \ninnovative  energy  efficiency  projects  for  external  financing  and  significantly  improve  the \ndevelopment impacts through adjustment and optimization of project designs. Their institutional \ncapacity needs to be further strengthened.  \n \n                                                 \n4  The  GS&DS  ensures  grid  discipline  (i.e.,  matching  power  generation  with  demand  on  a  real-time  basis); \naccordingly all generation units in a grid generate power under the instructions of the dispatcher. The generation \nschedule is based on anticipated availability of generation units and the demand forecast. Dispatch instructions are \nissued regularly to reduce or increase generation so that frequency of supply is 50 Hertz\u2014a measure of supply\u2013\ndemand balance. \n5  ADB. 2008.

The impact of the TA will be greater energy conservation and pollution reduction by the \nindustry and power sectors. The outcome will be enhanced institutional capacity for planning, \nfinancing, and implementing measures to improve the efficiency of energy supply and use.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA will consist of two parts: part A for energy use, and part B for \nenergy supply. Part A will deliver the following outputs: \n(i)  A summary report on the challenges and opportunities faced by key energy-\nintensive areas and the potential for energy conservation and pollution control in \nthese areas. \n(ii)  Policy and financing mechanism recommendations (in the form of policy briefs) to \nimplement  the  Government\u2019s  energy  efficiency  strategies  submitted  to  the \nNDRC. \n(iii)  Innovative financing and implementation mechanisms and risk evaluation and \nmanagement instruments for energy efficiency projects. \n(iv)  Suggestions on practical measures to support institutions and agencies in the \nenergy  conservation  market,  including  domestic  energy  service  companies; \nbanks  interested  in  financing  energy  efficiency  projects;  and  other  entities \nproviding legal, technological, and financial services for energy conservation. \n(v)  Training programs and other national and provincial capacity-building support \n(including a study tour to learn and share international experience). \n \n11.  Part B will deliver the following outputs:  \n(i)  Draft guidelines and operational manuals for the new GS&DS.   \n(ii)  Analysis of the effects of the new GS&DS on power sector reform, i.e., the \neventual establishment of a competitive wholesale electricity market. \n(iii)  Performance efficiency analysis of CGUs and recommendations to promote low-\ncarbon power generation. \n(iv)  Policy recommendations for wholesale electricity tariff reform and promotion of \nlow-carbon power generation. \n(v)  Capacity development and information sharing among national and provincial \nofficials.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $2,000,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,500,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program and $900,000 by the Climate Change Fund, all on a grant basis. The grant \nto be provided by the Climate Change Fund will be front-loaded at the relevant TA contract \ncommitment level. The Government will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to $500,000, \nthrough in-kind contribution in the form of office accommodation, logistic facilities, interpretation \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nservices, and remuneration of counterpart staff. The Fact-Finding Mission was assured by the \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nGovernment that the counterpart service, facilities, and funds will be available as required \naccording to the implementation schedule of the TA. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n ", "4   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Foreign Capital Utilization Department of the NDRC will be the Executing Agency \n(EA) for part A, and the National Energy Administration for part B. Both EAs have already \nnominated  staff  as  project  management  officers,  who,  with  the  support  of  the  consultants \nengaged under the TA, will  be responsible for implementing the TA on a day-to-day basis.  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from March 2009 to August 2010. The two \nparts  of  the  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  separate  teams  of  consultants  with  expertise  and \nprofessional networks in related areas in the PRC, as well as knowledge and experience in (i) \ninstitutional, economic, technical, financial, and environmental analysis; (ii) impact evaluation \nand  monitoring;  and  (iii)  enhancement  of  institutional  capacities.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n15.  The consulting services estimated for part A are 8 person-months for four international \nexperts  (an  energy  efficiency  specialist,  an  energy  economist,  a  financial  management \nspecialist, and an environmental specialist), and a combined total of 60 person-months for 10 \nnational consultants (three energy efficiency specialists, two energy economists, two financial \nmanagement specialists, an environmental specialist, an energy service company specialist, \nand an institutional capacity-building specialist). A consulting firm will be engaged to implement \npart A using the quality (80% weighting) and cost-based (20%) selection method. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants for part A are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The consulting services estimated for part B are 4 person-months for two international \nexperts and a combined total of 42 person-months for nine national consultants. Consultants \nrequired include experts in (i) GS&DS; (ii) power system control; (iii) electrical engineering; (iv) \nCGU performance monitoring; (v) energy economics, particularly on electricity market reform; (vi) \nsocial and environmental safeguards; and (vii) training and public information dissemination. \nSimilar expertise is required for both international and national consultants. Considering that the \nEA is already implementing the pilot GS&DS, consulting services for part B are divided into two \npackages with different approaches for engaging consultants. Package 1 will be for output (i) \nand package 2 for outputs (ii)\u2013(v) of part B. Package 1 includes a GS&DS specialist, a power \nsystem control specialist, an electrical engineer, and a CGU performance monitoring specialist, \ntotaling 20 person-months of consulting services. The national consultants will be engaged for \npackage 1 on an individual basis due to (i) the high weight for individual\u2019s experience and \nqualifications, (ii) the technical expertise required on the PRC\u2019s CGU performance monitoring, \n(iii) the urgency of fielding consultants to summarize pilot test results, (iv) the greater individual \nfield contribution and less support from home office, and (v) the fact that the unique nature of \nthe pilot GS&DS allows little opportunity for replication of any international experience. The EA \nwill coordinate the activities of national consultants under package 1. Package 2 includes two \ninternational consultants (two energy economists, totaling 4 person-months) and five national \nconsultants (three energy economists, a safeguard specialist, and a training specialist, totaling \n22 person-months). A consulting firm will be engaged for package 2 using the quality (80% \nweighting)  and  cost-based  (20%)  selection  method.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants for part B are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  Training, seminars, and workshops under parts A and B will be organized and conducted \nthrough  consulting  services.  Consultants  are  expected  to  provide  training  materials  and \nimportant topics will be highlighted during workshops and seminars. Consultants are required to \n ", "  5\nsummarize seminars/workshops and training results and report to the EAs and ADB. After the \ntraining  session,  specific  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  trainees  to  enhance  their \ncapacity in their respective workplace. The procurement of relevant equipment under the TA \n($37,000 for part A and $50,000 for part B) will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The ownership of the equipment \nprocured under the TA will be transferred to the relevant EA after completion of the TA. TA \nfunds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, \nas amended from time to time).7 \n \n18.  The TA deliverables and progress reports should address relevant aspects of the terms \nof reference for consultants and will be prepared in English and translated into Chinese. The \nconsultants will maintain close working relations with ADB and the EAs. Tripartite meetings \namong ADB staff, the EAs, and the consultants will be held periodically to provide guidance to \nthe consultants and to review their reports.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for the Utilization of Foreign Capital to \nPromote Energy Conservation and Energy-Efficient Power Generation Scheduling, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.
