INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2008  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to strengthen the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations in the \nPRC.1 In August 2009, an ADB mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The rapid economic development of the last 20 years, in combination with the PRC\u2019s \nlarge population, has placed pressure on the PRC\u2019s environment. Industries with high energy \nconsumption and emissions pose increasing environmental threats, and constitute a growing \nchallenge to environmental protection. Frequent, serious pollution incidents and poor on-site \nenforcement have resulted from (i) a lack of environmental awareness and understanding of \nenvironmental responsibilities on the part of some enterprises, (ii) easing of pollution controls by \nsome local governments to favor economic growth, and (iii) a lack of effective supervisory \ncapacity by responsible administrative authorities over relevant local departments.  \n \n3.  To address these environmental challenges, over the years the PRC has strengthened \nits regulatory framework and enacted several environmental protection laws and regulations. \nWhile impressive progress has been made with respect to the development of an environmental \nregulatory  framework,  much  work  remains  to  be  done  with  regard  to  compliance  and \nenforcement. Environmental laws in the PRC are difficult to enforce, with enforcement occurring \nmainly through administrative procedures instead of the civil or criminal courts.2 Enforcement \nagencies  are  faced  with  growing  constraints  due  to  limited  capacity,  knowledge,  and \nenforcement experience. Some legislation have become outdated and irrelevant, and some are \nno longer effective. Many enforcement agencies in the PRC have been exploring alternative and \nmore efficient rules and procedures.  \n \n4.  In 1996, the PRC's State Environmental Protection Administration\u2014which was upgraded \nin 2008 to the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP)\u2014adopted rules and procedures for \nenvironmental  supervision  to  guide  environmental  enforcement  agencies  nationwide.  To \nstrengthen county- and city-level compliance in the field of environmental protection, MEP has \nestablished six regional environmental supervision and investigation institutes (RESIIs) since \n2006 to help local governments and relevant departments fulfill their responsibilities on behalf of \nMEP.  \n \n5.  The progress achieved through the establishment of the RESIIs and MEP needs to be \naccompanied by (i) updating of the rules and procedures for environmental supervision, and (ii) \nthe  introduction  of  innovative  approaches  to  environmental  compliance.  As  environmental \nawareness increases, public scrutiny is expected to intensify and this could reduce tolerance \nand  result  in  more  complaints  and  environmental  disputes.  This  highlights  the  need  for  a \nbalance  between  (i)  creating  incentives  for  and  developing  the  capacity  of  environmental \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 18 September 2009. \n2  See for example the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 2007. Environmental Performance \nReview: China. Paris.  \n ", "2   \nenforcement agencies to handle public complaints, and (ii) placing greater demands on these \nagencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  improved  environmental  management  and \nsustainable development in the PRC. The outcome of the TA will be a strengthened regulatory \nframework for environmental enforcement and compliance in the PRC. The TA will assist in \nmainstreaming environmental considerations into the PRC\u2019s policies and investment programs, \nand in strengthening the legal, regulatory, and enforcement capacities of government agencies. \nThe proposed TA is in line with ADB\u2019s core area of operations as expressed in its long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)3 and the country partnership strategy (2008\u2013\n2010).4 The proposed TA supports the implementation of the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP) (2006\u20132010), which emphasizes the need to build a society that uses resources efficiently \nand  is  environment-friendly.  While  environmental  challenges  in  the  PRC  are  diverse  and \nincreasing, the 11th FYP seeks to reduce the emissions in 2005 of major pollutants by 10% by \nthe end of 2010. The proposed TA will also contribute to the preparation of the 12th FYP (2011\u2013\n2015), which is expected to introduce new approaches for environmental protection in the PRC. \n \n7.  The  proposed  TA  builds  on  the  achievements  of  the  ADB-financed  Institutional \nDevelopment of the State Environmental Protection Administration's RESII.5 This TA supported \nMEP  with  the  establishment  of  the  RESIIs,  the  development  of  strategic  road  maps  and \ninstitutional development plans, and the provision of training for the staff of MEP, RESIIs, and \nprovincial  environmental  protection  bureaus.  The  proposed  TA  will  also  incorporate  the \nexperiences  and  lessons  learned  from  the  (i)  support  that  ADB  provides  for  the  Asian \nEnvironmental Compliance and Enforcement Network6 to promote improved compliance with \nenvironmental policies, laws, and regulations through the exchange of innovative policies and \npractices; and (ii) ADB review of country safeguard systems.7 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The proposed TA will support the enforcement capacity of national, regional, and local \nenforcement agencies through analyses, assessments, recommendations, and training. The \nproposed TA will have three outputs.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

Output 1: Innovative approaches to environmental enforcement and supervision \nin support of sustainable economic growth. A study will be conducted on how innovative \napproaches to environmental enforcement and supervision can be introduced in the PRC to \nsupport sustainable economic growth. This study will include \n \n(i)  a  review  of  international  experience  with  environmental  supervision  and \ncompliance in France, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom;8  \n(ii)  an analysis of the potential application in the PRC of the specific environmental \nenforcement rules and work procedures in the selected countries; \n(iii)  a  review  of  the  role  of  civil  society  organizations  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of compliance mechanisms; \n(iv)  a study tour to one of the case-study countries; \n(v)  recommendations for the PRC, based on the experiences and best practices of \nthe countries studied; and \n(vi)  a published report on the role of innovative, and market-based enforcement and \nsupervision approaches to support sustainable economic growth. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Updated  environmental  enforcement  and  supervision  rules  and \nprocedures. The TA will help MEP update the existing rules and procedures for environmental \nenforcement  and  supervision,  taking  into  account  the  current  institutional  setting  and  the \nfindings of the study on innovative approaches. Updating the enforcement and supervision rules \nand procedures is part of the responsibility of MEP's Department of Environmental Enforcement \nand Inspection. MEP's work procedures for environmental supervision cover the (i) pollution \nsource, (ii) pollution control facilities, (iii) construction activities, (iv) project compliance, (v) \npermit issuance and compliance, (vi) discharge fee collection, (vii) management and use of \nenvironmental grants, (viii) on-site penalties, (ix) administrative penalties, (x) environmental \npollution and damages investigation and response, and (xi) environmental dispute investigation \nand response. This output also aims to (i) establish an updated framework for the actions of \nenvironmental enforcement agencies, (ii) specify the duties of these agencies, and (iii) formulate \ndifferentiated work rules and procedures for these agencies at all levels based on their authority \nand duties.  \n \n11.  The activities will include \n \n(i)  a review of the current environmental enforcement and supervision rules and \nprocedures  in  light  of  the  changes  in  environmental  management  systems, \noperational mechanisms, and models of enforcement supervision; \n(ii)  a rapid capacity assessment of the institutional capacity of the six RESIIs; \n(iii)  preparation  of  recommendations  and  proposals  regarding  the  rules  and \nprocedures to be withdrawn and to be reformulated, including, where applicable, \nspecific sections dealing with the major industries (e.g., petrochemical, paper-\nmaking, thermal power plants, and pharmaceutical); and \n(iv)  preparation of environmental enforcement supervision rules and procedures. The \nupdated rules and procedures will be submitted to MEP for issuance after the \nendorsement by a TA steering committee. \n \n                                                 \n8 The final selection of the case studies will be made by MEP and ADB during the inception phase, in consultation \nwith the TA consultants. The criteria for selection will include the historical similarities with the PRC in terms of \ndevelopment, regulatory system, and environmental threats. \n ", "4   \n12.  Output 3: Training manuals, awareness-raising materials, and training. Training \nand awareness materials will be prepared for the introduction of the updated supervision rules \nand procedures at the regional and local levels. The activities will include \n \n(i)  consultations with experts and enforcers;  \n(ii)  preparation of training manuals and awareness materials for specific sectors; \n(iii)  organization  of  seminars  on  enforcement  procedures  for  the  four  major \nindustries; and \n(iv)  preparation  and  implementation  of  training-of-trainers  workshops  for  the  six \nRESIIs  covering  the  rules  and  work  procedures  for  improved  environmental \nsupervision, including dispute resolution. It is anticipated that about 24 trainers \nwill be trained.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program (TASF-Others). The Government will finance the balance of the \ncost, equivalent to $100,000, through the provision of necessary data, office space, counterpart \nstaff, local transportation, and other administrative support. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.9  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months, from January to December \n2010. MEP will be the executing agency (EA). A TA steering committee will be established in \nMEP, chaired by the Deputy Director General of the Department of Environmental Enforcement \nand Inspection and comprised of representatives from relevant departments. It will provide \noverall guidance for TA implementation and endorse TA outputs. A TA management office will \nbe established in the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) of MEP, headed by the \nDirector of Division 1, and comprise one full-time FECO staff member and other staff members \nappointed from relevant MEP departments. The TA management office will be responsible for \nday-to-day operational matters among ADB, consultants, and related MEP departments and \ngovernment agencies.  \n \n15.  A team of consultants will be recruited for a total of 33 person-months, comprising 1 \ninternational expert for 3 person-months and 4 national experts for 30 person-months. The TA is \nintended to be partially delegated to the EA. The consultants will be recruited by the EA and \ncontracted by ADB using the individual selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual engagements are \nconsidered  to  be  more  economical  and  efficient  for  the  TA.  MEP  has  experience  in \nimplementing ADB TA projects and is capable of undertaking the selection of consultants in \naccordance with ADB's policies, guidelines, and procedures.10 Equipment will be procured by \nthe EA in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).
