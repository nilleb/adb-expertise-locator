INTRODUCTION \n1.  Within the span of a decade, the countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nhave seen, through the GMS Program,1 the emergence of a more integrated regional market. \nUntil recently, the GMS Program had focused on improving physical connectivity through a \nnetwork of transport, power, and telecommunications facilities.2 The new regional strategy for \nGMS 2004\u20132006 identifies the need to transform this historical focus on connectivity into an \nintegrated approach to economic development, i.e., working together to reduce poverty and \nimprove the quality of life of the poor.  \n2.  Recognizing that access to modern energy services is critical for economic development \nand for improving the quality of life of the poor, the GMS countries have requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to initiate a comprehensive study to define a regional strategy until \n2020 and identify the scope for future regional cooperation in all energy subsectors. Given the \nimportance of the energy sector, the GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update \nfor 2006\u20132008 included this technical assistance (TA)3 in the work program. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3.  The GMS countries have created several regional institutional arrangements. The focus \nof regional cooperation in the energy sector, one of the nine priority areas of the GMS Program, \nhas so far been on power trading and interconnection of transmission networks, coordinated \nthrough the GMS Electric Power Forum. An Intergovernment Agreement on Regional Power \nTrade was signed by all six member countries at the first GMS Summit in 2002 and a Regional \nPower Trading Coordination Committee is now functioning. In the last meeting of the GMS \nElectric Forum, its coverage was expanded so as to include all energy subsectors under the \nupgraded GMS Energy Sector Forum.  \n4.  The TA aims to develop a regional strategy to expand cooperation among the GMS  \ncountries. A regional strategy for the energy sector is considered necessary for four reasons. \nFirst, the geography of energy supply options does not correspond to national boundaries. \nOften, there are opportunities to reduce overall energy costs by exploring supply options beyond \nborders. Second, individual markets are at times too small to justify large-scale investments \nneeded to achieve scale efficiency. Third, cross-border energy supply provides diversification of \nsources  and  this is  vital  for  energy  security.  Finally,  the  energy  sector  has  environmental \nimplications beyond national boundaries, which need to be integrated in energy planning to \nachieve sustainable development.  \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  As one of the major GMS activities in the early 1990s, a study on subregional energy \nsector cooperation was completed in 1995.4 The study provided an overview of energy sector \ndevelopments, examined the scope of cooperation, and recommended specific projects and \nproject concepts to promote subregional cooperation in the sector. A number of priority projects \nidentified  under  the  study,  especially  the  provision  of  regional  power  generation  and \n                                                      \n1  The GMS Program covers Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided three investment loans and seven technical assistance (TA) \nprojects to promote regional cooperation in the energy sector.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 26 August 2005. \n4  ADB.1995. Subregional Energy Sector Study for the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (Final Report).  ", "2     \ntransmission facilities, have been  successfully implemented through financial and technical \nassistance provided by the governments of the GMS countries, ADB, and other development \npartners. This work needs to be updated now for several reasons. First, the region faces a \nnumber  of  new  challenges.  Second,  vibrant  economic  growth  and  greater  integration  has \nopened up many opportunities for the energy sector. Finally, the original study did not prepare a \nregional least-cost plan which is considered essential to ensure efficiency gains from regional \nenergy trade and investments. Some of the salient challenges and opportunities are identified in \nparagraphs 6\u20139.  \n6.  Energy Demand, Access, and Quality of Supplies. The gross domestic product of the \nregion more than doubled between 1992 and 2002 as a result of impressive growth in economic \nactivities,  trade,  and  investment.  Such  rapid  growth  is  fueling  a  significant  rise  in  energy \ndemand. A major challenge facing the GMS countries such as People\u2019s Republic of China, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam  is  keeping  up  with  the  expected  demand  growth  due  to  rapid \nindustrialization,  and  maintaining  competitiveness  through  reasonable  and  reliable  energy \nsupplies. Most energy forecasts at national levels see the demand for energy continue to rise \nbetween 7% per annum to 16% per annum, at rates much faster than that of economic activities \nin  the  next  decade.  Therefore,  the  medium-term  regional  energy  strategy  has  to  identify \npossible alternatives so that this rapidly rising demand does not become a barrier to economic \ndevelopment. Overall access to energy is also very uneven across the region. It is estimated \nthat over 50 million people in the GMS lack access to electricity at present. These aggregate \nnumbers, though large, do not fully reflect the rural energy challenges individual countries or \nlocal and isolated communities face. In Cambodia, for example, over 70% of the rural population \ndo  not  have  access  to  modern  forms  of  energy  and  Cambodia\u2019s  per  capita  electricity \nconsumption is less than 10% of power consumption in Thailand. Finally, the quality of energy \nsupplies remains low and unpredictable in large parts of the region. Poor quality of energy \ninfrastructure imposes not only additional costs on the existing industrial production but also \naffects  business  environment  negatively.  Improving  access  and  overall  quality  of  energy \ninfrastructure and services is thus an important challenge facing the region. \n7.  Energy Security. In the medium term, the region has to grapple with multiple concerns \nsurrounding energy security. The region\u2019s rapid economic growth is fueling motorization and a \nvehicle boom in the region. As a result, the region\u2019s oil dependence is expected to increase \ndramatically in the next two decades. Poor production prospects, weak demand management, \ninsignificant penetration rates for alternative energy sources, and high global oil prices make the \nregion insecure and vulnerable. In addition, there are no institutional mechanisms to deal with \nenergy disruptions arising out of emergency or supply shocks.5 The proposed strategy has to \nwork on several tracks to enhance regional energy security.6 First, the GMS is well endowed \nwith energy resources, but their geographic distribution is uneven. There are large areas with \nunexplored potential for oil and gas resources within the GMS and so an integrated approach \nbeyond national boundaries to diversify energy base and supply options would enhance the \nsecurity of energy supply. Second, the region is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels; for \nexample, Thailand, one of the largest energy consumers in the region has to import 50% of \ndomestic energy needs whereas Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic import all \ncommercial fuels. A program to diversify the oil resource base within and outside the region can \nhelp  reduce  vulnerability.  Third,  the  cost  of  energy  supply  interruptions  can  have  serious \nconsequences on the growth and poverty reduction agenda. The proposed strategy will have to \n                                                      \n5  Except the commercial stock requirements.  \n6  The concept of energy security has been broadened to include external (geopolitical), internal (operation and \nmaintenance), and temporal aspects of ensuring energy supplies at affordable prices.  ", "    3\nexplore alternative institutional arrangements to deal with an energy emergency. Fourth, energy \nsecurity is an issue from the point of view of system reliability and efficiency, and cross-border \nenergy infrastructure connections will help reduce its costs. Finally, in addition to physical \nsecurity, affordability is an important aspect of energy security and so gains from efficiency \nthrough regional connectivity of infrastructure will be necessary. Given the low access rates and \nthe importance of energy in promoting growth and poverty reduction, energy security is a \nregional public good and thus needs to be addressed comprehensively under the proposed \nregional energy strategy.  \n8.  Expanding Private Participation. The GMS\u2019 various energy subsectors are dominated \nby public ownership at present though there have been some regional private projects such as \nNam Theun 2. The huge energy investments needed for the region in the medium term would \nrequire much more active private sector participation to mobilize financial and other resources, \nand  in  mitigating  risks,  promoting  competition, and  providing  incentives  for  efficiency.  It is \npossible to mobilize local finance through innovative public-private partnerships. At present, \ncountries are pursuing private sector participation in the energy sector at the national level. Most \ncountries have a number of independent power projects; however, the overall requirements are \nmuch higher than what is readily feasible at country level. A strategy at the regional level to \nattract private participation in strengthening energy trade and infrastructure connectivity will help \nreduce overall risks. Greater private participation in the energy sector is needed not only at the \nproject level, but also to enhance overall use efficiency. Energy efficiency is low even at the \nsector level: energy losses in the power systems are high in some parts of the region. Cost \nrecovery and reform programs need to be examined to identify structural and other barriers to \nenergy efficiency. Even at the consumer level, energy efficiency needs to be given adequate \nattention. The overall policy environment for the energy sector needs to be aligned to achieve \nenergy efficiency through a medium-term action plan that encourages an expanded role for the \nprivate sector. \n9.  Energy  and  Environment.  With  the  growing  energy  demand,  environmental \nsustainability issues will need to be integrated in the design at the planning stage to reduce the \nenvironmental costs of energy projects. The regional strategy can enhance efficiency of use of \ntraditional sources such as forests and biomass, given the high dependence on these resources \nin some parts of the region. Second, the region is rich in hydropower potential and future \ndevelopment of this resource needs to integrate possible environmental costs in the plan itself. \nThis is important because as the experience of the Nam Theun 2 project has shown, cross-\nborder environmental externalities need to be integrated in the planning and design of  large \nenergy projects. There is also a need to enhance the institutional and policy framework to \nintegrate environmental and social costs in energy projects at the regional level.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA aims to develop a regional strategy to expand cooperation among the member \ncountries to meet rising energy needs and help develop a robust regional energy market. The \nTA will (i) help articulate the region\u2019s clear vision about GMS energy cooperation, (ii) prepare an \naction plan to meet the emerging energy challenges during 2006\u20132020, (iii) identify priority \ninvestment projects including private sector financing to enhance energy trade and investment \nin the region, and (iv) prepare an outline of institutional and other arrangements to enhance \nregional energy security.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "4     \n11.  The  outputs  of  the  study  will  include  inception  report,  demand  forecasts,  resource \nassessments, economic and financial costing, environmental and social analyses, a regional \nleast-cost energy plan, energy databases, an operating framework for regional collaboration, \nand a final regional energy strategy with a detailed action plan. The action plan will include \nprofiles of regional and other projects, and institutional and other reforms to enhance private \nsector  participation  in  energy  trade  and  investments.  Key  outputs  may  be  translated  into \nselected GMS languages, depending on demand and need. \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA7 will be implemented in a fully participatory way and will include national and \nregional workshops and consultations with energy experts, government officials, civil society \norganizations,  private  sector,  other  aid  agencies,  and  regional  groups.  It  will  use  existing \ninstitutional arrangements such as the GMS Energy Sector Forum for consultation processes. \nThe TA will maintain a website and other means of communications to generate wide ownership \nof the process of strategy preparation. It will build on the existing internal and external studies, \nnational  energy  plans,  and  ongoing  work  by  development  partners  and  regional  groups, \nincluding work being undertaken within ADB on the GMS power plan. The TA will examine how \nintegrated energy networks have been developed in regional cooperation programs elsewhere \n(Africa, European Union, Latin America, etc.), and assess the possibility of adapting them to the \nGMS context. Key activities include (i) making a comprehensive assessment of past and current \nregional  energy  situation  to  identify  energy  challenges  by  country  and  by  subsector, \n(ii) identifiying constraints to greater energy cooperation and an action plan to reduce those \nbarriers,  (iii)  constructing  demand  forecasts  and  a  least-cost  energy  model  for  alternative \nscenarios, (iv) preparing priority projects and identifying resource needs, (v) analyzing regional \nenergy  vulnerability  and  preparing  an  action  plan  for  enhanced  regional  energy  security, \n(vi) identifying  priority  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  to  promote  cooperation,  and \n(vii) identifying key barriers to greater private sector participation to regional energy markets and \nan action plan to address these barriers. The TA will identify series of actions at national and \nregional levels to make integrated regional energy market a reality in the GMS.  \n13.  The TA will address equity and crosscutting issues, externalities such as increased \npollution (e.g., acid rains and greenhouse gases), social equity (e.g., job creation, relocation of \npopulations), deforestation, desertification, and natural disasters. It will assess the distribution of \ncosts and benefits of energy cooperation and particularly of cross-border interconnections.  \nC.   Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,000,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance \n$900,000 on a grant basis from its TA funding program. The GMS countries will contribute \n$100,000 equivalent in kind by providing office staff and counterpart staff time. Detailed cost \nestimates are provided in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Office of the Director General, \nMekong Department will take the lead in implementing the TA in collaboration and consultation \nwith GMS countries. A steering committee under the aegis of the GMS Energy Sector Forum \n                                                      \n7  The TA will cover all energy subsectors, i.e., coal, power, oil, gas, and renewable energy. ", "    5\nwill be established to facilitate high level consultation with GMS governments. A small TA \nsecretariat will be established in the Office of the Director General, Mekong Department to \nensure smooth coordination of activities. The GMS countries will identify a focal point and a \ncounterpart agency to liaise directly with the TA secretariat and consultants. The counterpart \nagency  will  provide  the  relevant  national  data  and  information  for  the  study  and  facilitate \nconsultation with national stakeholders and policy makers in each country to ensure that the TA \nfindings and recommendations  are relevant to the respective countries.  \n16.  The  TA  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consulting  services,  which  will  be \nprovided by a consulting firm and a team of individual consultants. The consulting firm will be \nselected through simplified technical proposals. Individual consultants will be engaged either as \nindividuals or through agencies to supplement the work of the firm (peer review, additional \nsector expertise, etc.). Total international consulting inputs are estimated to be 28 person-\nmonths and total domestic consulting inputs are estimated to be 80 person-months.  \n17.  The consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. The TA will be implemented over approximately 18 months, from January 2006 to \nJune 2007. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. A suggested \noutline of the final report is in Appendix 4. \n18.  There will be a planning meeting in February 2006 where all stakeholders will be invited. \nThe first draft report containing the proposed strategy for GMS energy cooperation will be \nsubmitted to the GMS countries in July 2006. It will be discussed at a workshop of senior \nofficials of GMS countries in September 2006, before submission and endorsement by high-\nlevel government authorities at the GMS Energy Sector Forum in December 2006. The final \nstrategy will be published in the early part of 2007.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.
