INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Country Programming Mission in February 1993 the Government of\nthe Philippines requested technical assistance1 (TA) from the Bank to prepare an investment\nproject for agro-industrial development in the Western Visayas Region (WVR). The Project\nis based on the Bank-funded Development Master Plan Study. 2 This Study, initiated by the\nRegional Development Council, provides a framework for the economic and social\ndevelopment of the WVR, covering all sectors, for 15 years from 1993. The estimated\nexpenditure of P19.540 billion for the first five years is allocated largely to social services (54\nper cent) and infrastructure (35 per cent). The agriculture, forestry and fishery share is 7 per\ncent. A Bank Fact-Finding Mission visited the WVR from 3 to 17 November 1993 to identify\ndevelopment opportunities in the agriculture sector. The Mission visited all six WVR\nprovinces (Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guimaras, Iloilo, and Negros Occidental), and discussed\ndevelopment objectives, strategies and priorities with regional agencies, Governors, officials\nof provincial government agencies, non-government organization (NGO) personnel, and\nprivate sector representatives.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The gross regional domestic product (GRDP) for the WVR from 1987 to 1991\naveraged an annual growth rate of 2.3 per cent compared with national growth rate of 2.8\nper cent. The services sector registered the highest growth at 3.2 per cent, followed by\nindustry at 2.3 per cent and agriculture 1 .4 per cent. The average annual growth rate of real\nGRDP per capita was 0.82 per cent.\n3. The six provinces of WVR are located on three neighboring islands that can be\ntraversed easily by road or sea within a day's journey. The WVR has the fourth largest\npopulation in the Philippines, with 5.4 million in 1990 and its population is growing at 1 .7 per\ncent per annum. Poverty is particularly high in rural areas, where 62 per cent of the people\nhave incomes below the poverty level of P 6,174 ($224) per annum. 3 Antique and Guimaras\nare part of the 19 provinces in the economic development catch-up program coordinated by\nthe Presidential Commission for Countryside Development.\n4. The Western Visayas Development Master Plan identified agro-industrial\ndevelopment as a key strategy to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the WVR.\nRegional and provincial development plans, which have drawn on the Master Plan (see\npara. 1), have adopted agro-industrial development as a major strategy for development.\nThe Master Plan recommended 28 financially viable project activities that could be (i) based\non locally produced and/or processed agricultural, marine, aquatic and forest products; and\n(ii) undertaken by owner-operators, cooperatives and private companies at levels of\ninvestment ranging from $12,000 to $130 million (see Appendix 1).\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 1993.\nTA No. 1496-PHI: Western Visayas Development Master Plan Study for Regional Development Council\nRegion VI, for $1,336,000, approved on 19 March 1991.\nNational Statistics Coordination Board, 'What Do You Know About Our Poverty Statistics\", December 1992.\n_,\t I_'\t -\t - ,\t , -\t -", "5. In 1988 the WVR had 5,992 or 7.6 per cent of the manufacturing establishments\nin the Philippines. Only 1 per cent are considered as medium or large (having more than\n100 employees). About 95 per cent of the establishments are cottage industries (with less\nthan 9 employees), dominated by food and garment activities. The WVR's main agro-\nindustries are sugar, milled rice, shrimp and prawn processing, tropical fruits and juices,\ncassava starch and edible oil from copra.\n6. The development of agriculture has focused on the production of primary\nproducts and industry has focused on import-dependent manufacturing and processing.\nEven with a substantial agricultural resource base, the linkages between agriculture and\nindustry have not capitalized on the opportunities for joint development. Agriculture and\nindustry are to be treated under a common framework to emphasize the links in the activities\ninvolved in producing, processing and marketing agricultural products. These activities\ninclude input suppliers, farmers, transporters, processors, distributors, financial entities,\nresearch agencies, government, industrial associations, chambers of commerce, training and\neducational institutions. The entities involved can be individuals, associations, cooperatives,\nprivate enterprise and government organizations. In pursuing agro-industrial development,\nan industry approach is required to accommodate the interdependencies and stakeholders1\ninvolved.\n7. The major constraints to agro-industrial development in the WVR include\ndisincentives emanating from government policies and regulations; inadequate transport\nincluding interisland shipping and communications infrastructure; inaccessibility of credit;\nlimited research and extension; weak linkages between agribusiness firms and small farmers;\nlack of marketing knowledge and expertise; difficulties in accessing modern technologies;\nquantity and quality of raw materials; obsolete processing equipment; limited agricultural\nstorage; and limited skilled technical, administrative and managerial personnel.\n8. The process of agro-industrial development must be led by the private sector and\ndriven by the market, yet it must benefit most rural smallholders in support of the Bank's and\nthe Government's strategies for agricultural development. Agro-industrial development in the\nWVR requires a long-term (10-year) strategy to address the interdependency of activities and\nstakeholders involved and to provide an enabling environment for private sector led\ndevelopment.\n9. With implementation of the Local Government Code (LGC) 2 there is greater\nopportunity for provincial governments to play an integrating role in supporting agro-industrial\ndevelopment. The technical, administrative, managerial and financial capability of local\ngovernment units (LGUs) to meet the expectations of the private sector in providing this\nsupporting role needs further examination. The growing cooperation among the private\nsector, government, NGOs, cooperatives and large private businesses should be\nencouraged. There will be an increasing need for private sector involvement in helping its\nown agro-industrial growth.\nA stakeholder is any organization or person who has an interest in the project's success, contributes to\nor is affected by the objectives of the project, or can influence the problems and opportunities to which\nit responds.\nThe Local Government Code of 1991, effective from January 1992, devolved considerable responsibility,\npower and resources to the local government units.", "3\n10. The goal of the Project designed under the TA is to stimulate regional economic\ndevelopment, and the purpose of the Project is to increase agro-industrial development with\na focus on small and medium enterprises. The TA will formulate a comprehensive strategy\nfor phasing agro-industrial development in the WVR. The Project, being the first phase, will\nfocus on investments to support the private sector and will probably include institutional\ncapability building and training, infrastructure, support services and pilot value-adding\nactivities. Through the vertical integration of enterprises, particularly cooperatives, within\nindustries, farmers will have increased control over their produce and can share in the value-\nadding process.\n11. The TA will initially address mainstream industries such as rice, corn and sugar,\nand diversified industries based on products identified by the LGUs and in the Master Plan\npre-investment studies. The final selection of industries for inclusion in the Project will be\nbased on criteria agreed among the Government, LGUs and the Bank. The criteria will\ninclude (i) the availability of raw material; (ii) the regional, national and international market\npotential; (iii) the level and availability of technology and current industry capacity; (iv) the\nscope for increased vertical integration by involving small to medium enterprises; and\n(v) viability and sustainability.\n12. The numerous stakeholders in agro-industrial development have their own\nobjectives and approaches. However, their involvement and cooperation is essential to the\nformulation of the Project and their subsequent ownership to the Project is fundamental to\nsustaining the agro-industrial process. To ensure the participation of stakeholders, a\nprocess-oriented approach to Project formulation and implementation will be adopted. In the\nTA, the consultants will operate as facilitators, using workshops as the primary instrument\nof participation to share views, identify problems, and develop consensus and commitment\nto the solutions and the Project. This approach is in line with the Bank's Medium Term\nStrategic Framework (1993-1996), which encourages the gradual shift in emphasis from\n\"blueprint\" projects to \"process-oriented\" projects.1\n13. The Project will be in accordance with the Bank's (i) Country Operational\nStrategy for the Philippines dated November 1993, which emphasizes growth and greater\nprivate sector involvement in the economy; and (ii) Agriculture Department Strategic\nFramework, 1993-1 996, which recommends assistance in diversifying agricultural production\nand value-adding opportunities through agro-industrial development and assistance for\nstrengthening cooperatives, NGOs and rural communities.\nIII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n14. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in formulating a long-term\nstrategy and designing the Project to stimulate agro-industrial development focusing on small\nand medium enterprises.\nThis TA will be supported by the ADTA: ZOPP Applications for Strengthening Community and Local\nGovernment Participation in Agriculture and Rural Development Project Implementation where this Project\nis identified as one of six projects involved.\n-\t\n-:-\t r-'\t '-\u2022 \"-\" I I'.JIUI\t VVV1\t .", "4\nB. Scope\n15. Within the framework of the LGC, the TA will (i) prepare a strategy for agro-\nindustry development in the WVR to be implemented in phases over a ten-year period;\n(ii) determine the components of the Project to be funded in Phase I, clearly identifying the\nrespective roles of the Government, LGUs and the private sector; (iii) assess the technical,\nfinancial, economic, social, institutional and environmental feasibility and sustainability of\nthe Project; and (iv) develop appropriate implementation, monitoring and financing\narrangements.\n16. The preparation of the Project is to be based on three essential elements: (i) the\nneed for the private sector to lead agro-industrial development in the WVR, (ii) the necessity\nfor LGUs to be able to provide the essential supporting infrastructure and institutional\nbuilding, and (iii) the necessity for all stakeholders from private sector and government to be\nactively involved. The TA will analyze factors that constrain or support the development of\neach selected industry, assess those that can and should be targeted for support, and define\nan investment project based on the initiatives identified.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA study is estimated at $860,750, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is $739,200 and the local currency cost is $121,550 equivalent. The foreign\nexchange cost and $83,050 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed by the Bank\non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund. The rest of the local currency cost will be\nfinanced by the Government. A breakdown of the cost estimates is given in Appendix 2.\n18. The cost of the Project is currently estimated to be about $50 million. The\nforeign currency requirements will be determined during the course of the TA. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA study does not commit the Bank to\nfinance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n19. The Executing Agency will be the Department of Agriculture (DA) of the\nPhilippines. The DA will be responsible for the general administration and coordination of\nthe TA with the relevant line agencies in the WVR (including the Regional Development\nCouncil and the regional office of the National Economic and Development Authority in Iloilo),\nprovincial governments and other stakeholders. A steering committee will be formed to\noversee and provide direction to the TA consultants. The DA will chair this committee which\nwill include representatives of the Regional Development Council, the National Economic and\nDevelopment Authority, the Department of Trade and Industry and the local business groups.\nOther agencies as required will be called on to participate. The provincial governments,\nthrough the planning and development office of each province, will be the implementing\nagencies for the TA. The DA will appoint a senior level officer as the counterpart Project\nDirector for the TA. The DA and each implementing agency will assign counterpart\nprofessional and supporting staff (secretaries and drivers) to assist the consultants, and will\nprovide suitable office space and amenities.\n20. The TA will be undertaken over a period of 7.5 months by an international\nconsulting firm to be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the", "5\nUse of Consultants. The firm will be responsible for recruiting a team of about five\ninternational consultants to provide a total of 28 person-months of services in agribusiness!\nmarketing (7.5 months), financial analysis (4 months), institutions/management and training\n(4 months), sociologist (2 months), environment (4 months) and various short-term specialists\n(6 months).1 The firm will also provide about five local consultants for a total of 26 person-\nmonths. The local consultants will be experts in agriculture/agribusiness economics\n(7.5 months), workshop facilitation (3 months), agribusiness/marketing (6 months), sociology\n(2 months), civil engineering (3 months) and various specializations for short terms\n(4 months).2 The detailed terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.\n21. Some essential office equipment3 and two vehicles will be procured for the use\nof the consultants under the TA. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on Procurement.\n22. The TA will be implemented over 7.5 months in two stages. The first stage will\nbuild on the Master Plan Study and will review recent developments in agro-industry, analyze\nthe investment potential and constraints, undertake case studies of successful agro-industry\nprojects and activities, select feasible investments, and determine the roles and commitments\nof the stakeholders. The stakeholders will be involved in this consultative process. Stage\ntwo will involve formulation of the long-term strategy and the Project, including feasibility\nstudies of site-specific project activities.\n23. The consultant team, in cooperation with the counterpart staff of DA and the\nimplementing agencies, will prepare four reports. An inception report will be submitted to\nthe Bank at the end of the third week. It will give details of the approach to be taken, and\nthe work program for the TA in general and first stage in particular. At the end of the tenth\nweek, the consultants will submit an interim report that summarizes the findings in the first\nstage, identifies and justifies the industries selected, develops the proposed Project and\nrefines the approach and scheduling of activities for the second stage. This report will be\nfollowed by a tripartite meeting to discuss the report and refine requirements for the second\nstage. A draft final report will be submitted at the end of the twenty-fifth week and will be\nfollowed by a tripartite meeting to review the report. The final report, incorporating comments\nfrom the Government and the Bank, will be submitted at the end of the thirtieth week.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n24. It is considered that the proposed technical assistance to the Government of the\nPhilippines is necessary for the purpose of the Western Visayas Agro-Industrial Development\nProject. The President recommends that the Board approve the proposed technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, in the amount of $822,250.\nThese short-term inputs will be based on the industries selected for inclusion in the Project.\nThese short-term inputs will be determined by the industries selected for investment activities.\nTwo, 386 kb microcomputers, each with a monitor, uninterruptible power source and software; one laser\nprinter; one long carriage dot matrix printer; one photocopier.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n6 Appendix 1\nPage 1\nPROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY PRE-INVESTMENT STUDIES IN\nAGRICULTURE, MARINE AND AQUATIC ACTIVITIES\n\tUnit investment\t Type of\nName\t Cost (P '000)\t Enterprise\nShrimp Production\n1.

During the Country Programming Mission in February 1993 the Government of\nthe Philippines requested technical assistance1 (TA) from the Bank to prepare an investment\nproject for agro-industrial development in the Western Visayas Region (WVR). The Project\nis based on the Bank-funded Development Master Plan Study. 2 This Study, initiated by the\nRegional Development Council, provides a framework for the economic and social\ndevelopment of the WVR, covering all sectors, for 15 years from 1993. The estimated\nexpenditure of P19.540 billion for the first five years is allocated largely to social services (54\nper cent) and infrastructure (35 per cent). The agriculture, forestry and fishery share is 7 per\ncent. A Bank Fact-Finding Mission visited the WVR from 3 to 17 November 1993 to identify\ndevelopment opportunities in the agriculture sector. The Mission visited all six WVR\nprovinces (Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guimaras, Iloilo, and Negros Occidental), and discussed\ndevelopment objectives, strategies and priorities with regional agencies, Governors, officials\nof provincial government agencies, non-government organization (NGO) personnel, and\nprivate sector representatives.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The gross regional domestic product (GRDP) for the WVR from 1987 to 1991\naveraged an annual growth rate of 2.3 per cent compared with national growth rate of 2.8\nper cent. The services sector registered the highest growth at 3.2 per cent, followed by\nindustry at 2.3 per cent and agriculture 1 .4 per cent. The average annual growth rate of real\nGRDP per capita was 0.82 per cent.\n3. The six provinces of WVR are located on three neighboring islands that can be\ntraversed easily by road or sea within a day's journey. The WVR has the fourth largest\npopulation in the Philippines, with 5.4 million in 1990 and its population is growing at 1 .7 per\ncent per annum. Poverty is particularly high in rural areas, where 62 per cent of the people\nhave incomes below the poverty level of P 6,174 ($224) per annum. 3 Antique and Guimaras\nare part of the 19 provinces in the economic development catch-up program coordinated by\nthe Presidential Commission for Countryside Development.\n4. The Western Visayas Development Master Plan identified agro-industrial\ndevelopment as a key strategy to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the WVR.\nRegional and provincial development plans, which have drawn on the Master Plan (see\npara. 1), have adopted agro-industrial development as a major strategy for development.\nThe Master Plan recommended 28 financially viable project activities that could be (i) based\non locally produced and/or processed agricultural, marine, aquatic and forest products; and\n(ii) undertaken by owner-operators, cooperatives and private companies at levels of\ninvestment ranging from $12,000 to $130 million (see Appendix 1).\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 1993.\nTA No. 1496-PHI: Western Visayas Development Master Plan Study for Regional Development Council\nRegion VI, for $1,336,000, approved on 19 March 1991.\nNational Statistics Coordination Board, 'What Do You Know About Our Poverty Statistics\", December 1992.\n_,\t I_'\t -\t - ,\t , -\t -", "5. In 1988 the WVR had 5,992 or 7.6 per cent of the manufacturing establishments\nin the Philippines. Only 1 per cent are considered as medium or large (having more than\n100 employees). About 95 per cent of the establishments are cottage industries (with less\nthan 9 employees), dominated by food and garment activities. The WVR's main agro-\nindustries are sugar, milled rice, shrimp and prawn processing, tropical fruits and juices,\ncassava starch and edible oil from copra.\n6. The development of agriculture has focused on the production of primary\nproducts and industry has focused on import-dependent manufacturing and processing.\nEven with a substantial agricultural resource base, the linkages between agriculture and\nindustry have not capitalized on the opportunities for joint development. Agriculture and\nindustry are to be treated under a common framework to emphasize the links in the activities\ninvolved in producing, processing and marketing agricultural products. These activities\ninclude input suppliers, farmers, transporters, processors, distributors, financial entities,\nresearch agencies, government, industrial associations, chambers of commerce, training and\neducational institutions. The entities involved can be individuals, associations, cooperatives,\nprivate enterprise and government organizations. In pursuing agro-industrial development,\nan industry approach is required to accommodate the interdependencies and stakeholders1\ninvolved.\n7. The major constraints to agro-industrial development in the WVR include\ndisincentives emanating from government policies and regulations; inadequate transport\nincluding interisland shipping and communications infrastructure; inaccessibility of credit;\nlimited research and extension; weak linkages between agribusiness firms and small farmers;\nlack of marketing knowledge and expertise; difficulties in accessing modern technologies;\nquantity and quality of raw materials; obsolete processing equipment; limited agricultural\nstorage; and limited skilled technical, administrative and managerial personnel.\n8. The process of agro-industrial development must be led by the private sector and\ndriven by the market, yet it must benefit most rural smallholders in support of the Bank's and\nthe Government's strategies for agricultural development. Agro-industrial development in the\nWVR requires a long-term (10-year) strategy to address the interdependency of activities and\nstakeholders involved and to provide an enabling environment for private sector led\ndevelopment.\n9. With implementation of the Local Government Code (LGC) 2 there is greater\nopportunity for provincial governments to play an integrating role in supporting agro-industrial\ndevelopment. The technical, administrative, managerial and financial capability of local\ngovernment units (LGUs) to meet the expectations of the private sector in providing this\nsupporting role needs further examination. The growing cooperation among the private\nsector, government, NGOs, cooperatives and large private businesses should be\nencouraged. There will be an increasing need for private sector involvement in helping its\nown agro-industrial growth.\nA stakeholder is any organization or person who has an interest in the project's success, contributes to\nor is affected by the objectives of the project, or can influence the problems and opportunities to which\nit responds.\nThe Local Government Code of 1991, effective from January 1992, devolved considerable responsibility,\npower and resources to the local government units.", "3\n10. The goal of the Project designed under the TA is to stimulate regional economic\ndevelopment, and the purpose of the Project is to increase agro-industrial development with\na focus on small and medium enterprises. The TA will formulate a comprehensive strategy\nfor phasing agro-industrial development in the WVR. The Project, being the first phase, will\nfocus on investments to support the private sector and will probably include institutional\ncapability building and training, infrastructure, support services and pilot value-adding\nactivities. Through the vertical integration of enterprises, particularly cooperatives, within\nindustries, farmers will have increased control over their produce and can share in the value-\nadding process.\n11. The TA will initially address mainstream industries such as rice, corn and sugar,\nand diversified industries based on products identified by the LGUs and in the Master Plan\npre-investment studies. The final selection of industries for inclusion in the Project will be\nbased on criteria agreed among the Government, LGUs and the Bank. The criteria will\ninclude (i) the availability of raw material; (ii) the regional, national and international market\npotential; (iii) the level and availability of technology and current industry capacity; (iv) the\nscope for increased vertical integration by involving small to medium enterprises; and\n(v) viability and sustainability.\n12. The numerous stakeholders in agro-industrial development have their own\nobjectives and approaches. However, their involvement and cooperation is essential to the\nformulation of the Project and their subsequent ownership to the Project is fundamental to\nsustaining the agro-industrial process. To ensure the participation of stakeholders, a\nprocess-oriented approach to Project formulation and implementation will be adopted. In the\nTA, the consultants will operate as facilitators, using workshops as the primary instrument\nof participation to share views, identify problems, and develop consensus and commitment\nto the solutions and the Project. This approach is in line with the Bank's Medium Term\nStrategic Framework (1993-1996), which encourages the gradual shift in emphasis from\n\"blueprint\" projects to \"process-oriented\" projects.1\n13. The Project will be in accordance with the Bank's (i) Country Operational\nStrategy for the Philippines dated November 1993, which emphasizes growth and greater\nprivate sector involvement in the economy; and (ii) Agriculture Department Strategic\nFramework, 1993-1 996, which recommends assistance in diversifying agricultural production\nand value-adding opportunities through agro-industrial development and assistance for\nstrengthening cooperatives, NGOs and rural communities.\nIII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n14. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in formulating a long-term\nstrategy and designing the Project to stimulate agro-industrial development focusing on small\nand medium enterprises.\nThis TA will be supported by the ADTA: ZOPP Applications for Strengthening Community and Local\nGovernment Participation in Agriculture and Rural Development Project Implementation where this Project\nis identified as one of six projects involved.\n-\t\n-:-\t r-'\t '-\u2022 \"-\" I I'.JIUI\t VVV1\t .", "4\nB. Scope\n15. Within the framework of the LGC, the TA will (i) prepare a strategy for agro-\nindustry development in the WVR to be implemented in phases over a ten-year period;\n(ii) determine the components of the Project to be funded in Phase I, clearly identifying the\nrespective roles of the Government, LGUs and the private sector; (iii) assess the technical,\nfinancial, economic, social, institutional and environmental feasibility and sustainability of\nthe Project; and (iv) develop appropriate implementation, monitoring and financing\narrangements.\n16. The preparation of the Project is to be based on three essential elements: (i) the\nneed for the private sector to lead agro-industrial development in the WVR, (ii) the necessity\nfor LGUs to be able to provide the essential supporting infrastructure and institutional\nbuilding, and (iii) the necessity for all stakeholders from private sector and government to be\nactively involved. The TA will analyze factors that constrain or support the development of\neach selected industry, assess those that can and should be targeted for support, and define\nan investment project based on the initiatives identified.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA study is estimated at $860,750, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is $739,200 and the local currency cost is $121,550 equivalent. The foreign\nexchange cost and $83,050 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed by the Bank\non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund. The rest of the local currency cost will be\nfinanced by the Government. A breakdown of the cost estimates is given in Appendix 2.\n18. The cost of the Project is currently estimated to be about $50 million. The\nforeign currency requirements will be determined during the course of the TA. The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA study does not commit the Bank to\nfinance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n19. The Executing Agency will be the Department of Agriculture (DA) of the\nPhilippines. The DA will be responsible for the general administration and coordination of\nthe TA with the relevant line agencies in the WVR (including the Regional Development\nCouncil and the regional office of the National Economic and Development Authority in Iloilo),\nprovincial governments and other stakeholders. A steering committee will be formed to\noversee and provide direction to the TA consultants. The DA will chair this committee which\nwill include representatives of the Regional Development Council, the National Economic and\nDevelopment Authority, the Department of Trade and Industry and the local business groups.\nOther agencies as required will be called on to participate. The provincial governments,\nthrough the planning and development office of each province, will be the implementing\nagencies for the TA. The DA will appoint a senior level officer as the counterpart Project\nDirector for the TA. The DA and each implementing agency will assign counterpart\nprofessional and supporting staff (secretaries and drivers) to assist the consultants, and will\nprovide suitable office space and amenities.\n20. The TA will be undertaken over a period of 7.5 months by an international\nconsulting firm to be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the", "5\nUse of Consultants. The firm will be responsible for recruiting a team of about five\ninternational consultants to provide a total of 28 person-months of services in agribusiness!\nmarketing (7.5 months), financial analysis (4 months), institutions/management and training\n(4 months), sociologist (2 months), environment (4 months) and various short-term specialists\n(6 months).1 The firm will also provide about five local consultants for a total of 26 person-\nmonths. The local consultants will be experts in agriculture/agribusiness economics\n(7.5 months), workshop facilitation (3 months), agribusiness/marketing (6 months), sociology\n(2 months), civil engineering (3 months) and various specializations for short terms\n(4 months).2 The detailed terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.\n21. Some essential office equipment3 and two vehicles will be procured for the use\nof the consultants under the TA. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on Procurement.\n22. The TA will be implemented over 7.5 months in two stages. The first stage will\nbuild on the Master Plan Study and will review recent developments in agro-industry, analyze\nthe investment potential and constraints, undertake case studies of successful agro-industry\nprojects and activities, select feasible investments, and determine the roles and commitments\nof the stakeholders. The stakeholders will be involved in this consultative process. Stage\ntwo will involve formulation of the long-term strategy and the Project, including feasibility\nstudies of site-specific project activities.\n23. The consultant team, in cooperation with the counterpart staff of DA and the\nimplementing agencies, will prepare four reports. An inception report will be submitted to\nthe Bank at the end of the third week. It will give details of the approach to be taken, and\nthe work program for the TA in general and first stage in particular. At the end of the tenth\nweek, the consultants will submit an interim report that summarizes the findings in the first\nstage, identifies and justifies the industries selected, develops the proposed Project and\nrefines the approach and scheduling of activities for the second stage. This report will be\nfollowed by a tripartite meeting to discuss the report and refine requirements for the second\nstage. A draft final report will be submitted at the end of the twenty-fifth week and will be\nfollowed by a tripartite meeting to review the report. The final report, incorporating comments\nfrom the Government and the Bank, will be submitted at the end of the thirtieth week.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n24. It is considered that the proposed technical assistance to the Government of the\nPhilippines is necessary for the purpose of the Western Visayas Agro-Industrial Development\nProject. The President recommends that the Board approve the proposed technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, in the amount of $822,250.\nThese short-term inputs will be based on the industries selected for inclusion in the Project.\nThese short-term inputs will be determined by the industries selected for investment activities.\nTwo, 386 kb microcomputers, each with a monitor, uninterruptible power source and software; one laser\nprinter; one long carriage dot matrix printer; one photocopier.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n6 Appendix 1\nPage 1\nPROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY PRE-INVESTMENT STUDIES IN\nAGRICULTURE, MARINE AND AQUATIC ACTIVITIES\n\tUnit investment\t Type of\nName\t Cost (P '000)\t Enterprise\nShrimp Production\n1.
