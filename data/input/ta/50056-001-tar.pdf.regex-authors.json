INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) formally announced the Asian \nBond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in 2003 to boost development of local currency bond markets. \nThe  overreliance  on  external  short-term  foreign  currency  borrowing  to  finance  long-term \ndomestic investments, commonly referred as the double mismatch problem, led to the Asian \ncurrency crisis in 1997\u20131998. The ABMI was intended to address the double mismatch problem \nby promoting local currency-based long-term finance, i.e., local currency bonds. The ABMI also \naims to channel savings within ASEAN+3 toward long-term investment. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has served as the ABMI\u2019s secretariat since inception as a part of ADB\u2019s strategy to \nsupport greater financial, fiscal, and macroeconomic stability in the region. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n2.  The  regional  research  and  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nABMI\u2019s ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF), which was established in May 2010 by the \nASEAN+3  finance  ministers  as  an  important  regional  platform  to  foster  standardization  of \nmarket practices and harmonization of regulations relating to cross-border bond transactions in \nASEAN+3.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  As a result of the efforts made by ASEAN+3 governments, the region\u2019s local currency \nbond markets have expanded since the Asian currency crisis. They are still modest in size, but \naggregated outstanding local currency bonds in ASEAN plus the PRC and the Republic of \nKorea increased from $1.349 trillion at the end of 2003 to $10.033 trillion at the end of June \n2016, making it now comparable with the size of Japan\u2019s bond market.3 The region was able to \nweather the global financial crisis in 2007\u20132008 thanks to the bond markets functioning as a \n\u201cspare  tire\u201d  for  the  stressed  banking  sector.4   However,  the  \u201ctaper  tantrum\u201d in  May  2013 \nexacerbated concerns over a capital flow reversal if the United States interest rates rose.5 \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investor behavior varies by region and \ncould lead to herd behavior.6 Another IMF report showed that foreign banks\u2019 local currency \nlending is less sensitive to global shocks than cross-border lending, which is normally United \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2016. \n2  Categorized as knowledge and support technical assistance under the new staff instructions effective 13 March \n2017. \n3  The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand have made significant advancements so that the size of their local \ncurrency bond markets in terms of gross domestic product is now comparable with those of Germany, the United \nKingdom, and Switzerland. The PRC market has a lot of room to grow in terms of gross domestic product ratio, but \nits absolute size is now larger than that of any European countries. \n4  Various evidence after the global financial crisis shows that local currency bond markets can play an important role \nin diversifying the financial system and mitigating the impact of financial crises on the real economy. \u201cIn Asia, local \nbond markets served as a \u2018spare tire\u2019 when other financing channels (e.g., bank and equity) were impaired at the \nonset of the global financial crisis, thus mitigating its impact.\u201d International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment. 2013. Local Currency Bond Markets\u2014A Diagnostic Framework. Washington, DC. \n5  \u201cTaper tantrum\u201d is the term used for the market turbulence in 2013 when the Federal Reserve signaled the end of \nits quantitative easing. \n6  \u201c[I]nvestor behavior can vary according to the region in which they are domiciled, due to differences in the specific \nfactors that are relevant for them. Therefore, attracting a geographically diverse investor base can help smooth \nflows.\u201d IMF. 2014. Moving from Liquidity- to Growth-Driven Markets. Global Financial Stability Report. April. \nWashington, DC. p. 92. \n ", "2 \n \nStates dollar-denominated.7 These reports suggest that herd behavior in international markets \nimpacting on local currency bond markets could be weakened if investors are more diversified \nand localized. To mitigate volatility caused by capital flow while benefiting from capital account \nopenness, ASEAN+3 needs further market integration. Investments based on local information, \nand recycling funds within the region would counteract such herd behavior. \n4.  Against this backdrop, the New Medium-Term Road Map of the ABMI was endorsed in \nMay 2016 at the 19th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 and Central Bank Governors\u2019 Meeting \n(AFMGM+3) in Frankfurt, Germany. The new road map outlines various activities during 2016\u2013\n2019, including existing support for the ABMF as well as new initiatives such as green bonds to \nhelp meet the demand for infrastructure developments. \n5.  Since its establishment, the ABMF has produced various outputs and created impacts \nwith the support of previous TA projects. First, in 2012, the ABMF released the ASEAN+3 Bond \nMarket Guide.8 This was the first officially recognized publication of bond market regulations and \nsettlement procedures of the respective ASEAN+3 economies. The market guide helped narrow \ninformation gaps and increase market transparency, which was often regarded as the biggest \nbarrier  to  entry.  In  2014,  to  provide  policy  recommendations  to  standardize  securities \ntransaction flows in the region, the ABMF published the (i) Sub-Forum 1 (SF1) Phase 2 Report: \nProposal  on  ASEAN+3  Multi-Currency  Bond  Issuance  Framework (AMBIF)  as  a regionally \nstandardized bond issuance framework; and (ii) Sub-Forum 2 (SF2) Phase 2 Report: ASEAN+3 \nInformation on Transaction Flows and Settlement Infrastructures.9 After the endorsement of \nthese reports by the ASEAN+3 finance ministers, in 2015, the ABMF released two phase 3 \nreports: (i) Implementation of the AMBIF: ABMF SF1 Phase 3 Report; and (ii) Harmonization \nand Standardization of Bond Market Infrastructures in ASEAN+3: ABMF SF2 Phase 3 Report. \nThe SF1 Phase 3 report contained the single submission form to be utilized in the markets \nparticipating in the AMBIF and explained procedures to issue an AMBIF bond, which led to the \nfirst AMBIF pilot issue in Thailand in September 2015. The SF2 Phase 3 report (i) identified and \nagreed  upon  key  transactional  financial  messages  to  be  harmonized  and  standardized  to \nfacilitate cross-border bond transactions, and (ii) successfully demonstrated the readiness of the \nregion  to  implement  key  international  standards  such  as  International  Organization  for \nStandardization (ISO) 20022 by 2020.10 As a result, implementation of ISO 20022 was included \nas one of strategic measures in the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025 for financial \nintegration.11 In addition, based on the SF1 phase 3 report, the first AMBIF bond was issued in \nThailand in September 2015 and the bond was cross-listed in the TOKYO PRO-BOND Market. \n6.  Based  on  the  New  Medium-Term  Road  Map  of  the  ABMI  (para.  4),  the  ABMF  is \nexpected to do the following: \n                                                \n7  \u201c[T]he shift to more local as opposed to cross-border operations results in a decline in the sensitivity of capital flows \nto global shocks and yields a reduction in contagion. Foreign banks operating locally rather than through cross-\nborder transactions tend to contract credit much less following domestic shocks in host countries.\u201d IMF. 2015. \nNavigating Monetary Policy Challenges.

THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be greater financial stability through regional bond market integration in \nthe ASEAN+3 region. More integrated markets will be less vulnerable to global shocks. The \noutcome will be strengthened intraregional mobilization of funds within ASEAN+3. The ABMF \nwill support various activities to create the outputs that will facilitate more active intraregional \ntransactions, which will lead to recycling of funds within the region. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support the ABMF to conduct activities12 stipulated in the New Medium-Term \nRoad Map and provide recommendations to the ABMI Task Force 3 on Strengthening the \nRegulatory Framework (TF3).13 The TA outputs are provided in paras. 9\u201314. \n \n9.  Output  1:  ASEAN+3  Multi-Currency  Bond  Issuance  Framework  participating \nmarkets increased. The ABMF will discuss, together with regulators, how to increase the \nnumber of AMBIF participating markets from the original six to as many as possible. \n \n10.  Output  2:  New  ASEAN+3  Multi-Currency  Bond  Issuance  Framework  bond \nissuance created. The ABMF will discuss how to create AMBIF pilot issues, preferably in all \nAMBIF participating markets, because AMBIF implementation will introduce international bond \nmarket practices into domestic bond markets. \n \n11.  Output 3: Regulatory and tax hurdles for ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance \nFramework  identified.  To  promote  the  AMBIF,  the  ABMF  will  conduct  a  study  on  tax \nprocedures to identify regulatory and tax hurdles. The initial study will cover AMBIF participating \n                                                \n12 None of the proposed activities under this TA will commence or be financed in the respective developing member \ncountries unless a no-objection in writing from such developing member countries concerned have been obtained. \n13 ABMI currently has four task forces: Task Force 1 on promoting the issuance of local currency denominated bonds \n(co-chaired by Thailand and the PRC), Task Force 2 on facilitating demand for local currency bonds (co-chaired by \nSingapore and Japan), Task Force 3 on improving regulatory frameworks (co-chaired by Malaysia and Japan), and \nTask Force 4 on improving the infrastructure for bond markets (co-chaired by the Republic of Korea and the \nPhilippines). \n ", "4 \n \nmarkets  before  expanding  coverage  to  other  markets  in  ASEAN+3.  The  ABMF  will  make \nrecommendations to ASEAN+3 policy makers for their consideration. \n \n12.  Output  4:  Challenges  relating  to  cross-border  collateral  and  repo  as  well  as \nsecurities  lending  and  borrowing  identified. The ABMF will conduct a study to identify \nchallenges  relating  to  cross-border  collateral  and  repo  as  well  as  securities  lending  and \nborrowing.  The  ABMF  will  make  recommendations  to  ASEAN+3  policy  makers  for  their \nconsideration. \n \n13.  Output  5:  International  standards,  including  International  Organization  for \nStandardization 20022, adopted, or their adoption plan in the key market infrastructures \nannounced. The ABMF will organize workshops to support the implementation of ISO 20022 in \nASEAN as stated as one of strategic measures in ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint \n2025.14 \n \n14.  Output 6: Initial assessment of possible information platform conducted. Together \nwith the ABMI Task Force 2, which is responsible for managing AsianBondsOnline, the ABMF \nwill discuss the improvement of AsianBondsOnline as the initial step toward establishing a \nregional information platform. \n \n15.  Risks.  The  project  risks  are  (i)  unexpected  political  events  that  disrupt  regional \ncooperation among the ASEAN+3 member states, (ii) unexpected financial shocks and market \ndisruptions that prioritize domestic issues over regional integration efforts, (iii) weak commitment \nfrom and involvement of the ABMF members due to resource constraints, and (iv) lack of \nresources of the ASEAN+3 member states to implement recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund 15  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  and  administered  by  ADB.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  The  Office  of  the  Director  General, \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDOD) will implement the TA in \nconsultation with ABMF members and the ABMI TF3 co-chaired by the governments of Japan \nand Malaysia, and will supervise the consultants\u2019 work. The SDOD will closely coordinate with \nADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department,  East  Asia  Department,  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment, Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, and Finance Sector \nGroup in implementation. The project will be implemented over 30 months from April 2017 to \nSeptember 2019. \n18.  The TA will require 50 person-months of individual international consultant services and \n30 person-months of individual national consultant services, comprising (i) 20 person-months for \na lead bond business and financial operation specialist, (ii) 10 person-months for a financial \n                                                \n14 The PRC and Japan have already implemented ISO 20022 in their central bank, interbank, and securities \nsettlement infrastructures. \n15 Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "5 \n \nlegal expert, (iii) 6 person-months for a financial information technology expert, (iv) 5 person-\nmonths for a financial tax law expert, (v) 4 person-months for a financial service standards \nexpert, (vi) 3 person-months for a cross-border collateral and repo transaction expert, (vii) 2 \nperson-months for an economic and finance editor, and (viii) 30 person-months for a national \nconsultant. \n19.  A team from the SDOD comprising at least two international staff (one of them acting as \nthe  project  manager),  one  national  officer,  and  one  operations  assistant  will  work  as  the \nsecretariat of the ABMF to support and facilitate communication and coordination among the \nexperts in the region to implement the TA. The SDOD team will organize ABMF meetings in \nclose coordination with the members. \n20.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2013, as  amended from time  to time). The  outline  terms  of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). An \nADB  staff  team  from  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department  will \nregularly monitor and administer the individual contracts, and manage the combined outputs to \nachieve the TA objectives. In the event that ADB staff act as resource persons for the purpose \nof effectiveness, travel costs are charged to the TA, but their salaries and benefits are absorbed \nby internal administrative expense budget.16 \n21.  The ABMI TF3 will monitor and evaluate TA implementation at least twice per year. The \nABMI TF3 will evaluate the TA continuously and provide guidance as necessary. After the \nassessment by the ABMI TF3, the ABMF\u2019s reporting will be elevated to the ASEAN+3 deputies\u2019 \nmeeting twice a year, and then to the AFMGM+3, which is held at the same time as ADB\u2019s \nAnnual Meeting. The outcome of the ABMF and report to the AFMGM+3 will be published, if \nappropriate.  In  addition,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  will  be  reflected  in  the  TA \ncompletion report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,600,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for Support for ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum under \nthe New Asian Bond Markets Initiative Medium-Term Road Map, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n                                                \n16 A  memo  from  ADB\u2019s  Budget,  Personnel,  and  Management  Systems  Department  and  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment (26 June 2013) provides guidance on charging costs to TA and internal administrative expense \nbudgets. It states that, for preparatory works, implementation, and administrative support, ADB staff are not eligible \nto charge corresponding salaries and benefits to the TA. If the TA paper clearly specifies in its cost estimates that it \nwill provide support such as travel and administrative expenses, then such costs should be charged to the TA. \n ", "6       Appendix 1         \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nGreater financial stability through regional bond market integration in the ASEAN+3 regiona \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020:     \nIntraregional  Intraregional portfolio debt  Asian Development Bank\u2019s  Unexpected \nmobilization of funds  share of ASEAN+3 increases  Asia Regional Integration  political event that \nwithin ASEAN+3  to more than 17% (2014  Center\u2019s Integration  disrupts regional \nstrengthened  baseline: 12.96%)  Indicators  cooperation \namong the \nASEAN+3 \nmember states \nUnexpected \nfinancial shocks \nand market \ndisruptions that \nprioritize domestic \nissues over \nregional \nintegration efforts \nOutputs  By 2019:     \n1.
