THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridors 1 and 3 Connector Road Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  connect  two  major  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) regional corridors by rehabilitating a crucial connector road, part of the North\u2013South \nAlternate Corridor, which is a priority in the National Sustainable Development Strategy.2 It will \n(i)  improve  connectivity  and  mobility,  (ii)  link  economically  underprivileged  regions  with \neconomic hubs, and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity by introducing and implementing a \nroad  asset  management  system  (RAMS)  and  a  project  implementation  unit  administrative \nmanual and procedure.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous, landlocked country surrounded by the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Despite its strategic location \nconnecting the PRC with the rest of Central Asia, the country\u2019s 2015 per capita gross domestic \nproduct of $1,094 was the second lowest among the countries that form the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States. About 30.6% of its population of 6 million people were living below the \nnational poverty line in 2014.4 The Kyrgyz Republic has limited resources with which to meet its \ngoals of sustainable growth and reducing persistent poverty. Poverty and economic disparities \ncontributed to popular unrest in the recent past and remain the greatest challenges faced the \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n4.  Road transport is the dominant means of transport in the Kyrgyz Republic, accounting \nfor about 95% of cargo and 96% of passenger traffic in 2015.5 An efficient transport sector is, \ntherefore,  essential  for  the  development  of  domestic  and  international  trade  and  poverty \nreduction. The country\u2019s transport network comprises approximately 35,000 kilometers (km) of \nroads. The Ministry of Transport and Roads (MOTR)6 is the lead agency for transport policy, \nregulation,  planning,  and  development.  It  manages  60  work  units  responsible  for  the \nconstruction, repair, and maintenance of 4,163 km of international roads, 5,678 km of national \nroads,  and  8,969  km  of  provincial  roads.  The  total  maintenance  budget  in  2015  was  \nSom1.8 billion. The government maintains separate road corridor management departments for \nthe  Bishkek\u2013Osh  and  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  roads  due  to  their  strategic  importance,  and  has \nprioritized the maintenance of these international roads.7 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

Manila. \n5  National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2015. Transport and Communications Statistics. Bishkek. \n6  On 29 June 2016, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic renamed the Ministry of Transport and Communications \nthe MOTR following the Parliament\u2019s approval with regard to the restructuring of the government. The MOTR\u2019s \nfunctions will remain the same as before, but communications functions will now fall under the State Committee of \nInformation Technology and Communications. \n7  MOTR. 2016. The Road Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025. Bishkek. \n ", "2 \n5.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s key national and regional road network comprises (i) two north\u2013\nsouth international corridors in the west and east, and (ii) one east\u2013west international corridors \nin the north (see map). To ensure the nation\u2019s balanced development, it is urgently necessary to \naddress the following network planning issues: (i) low density of the road and transport network, \nespecially in the country\u2019s center; and (ii) low access from national roads to local city centers \nand international highways, especially the north\u2013south international highways in the west and \neast. These issues seriously constrain transport logistics and inclusive economic growth. \n \n6.  CAREC Corridor 1 connects the Russian Federation and Europe to PRC; it is the only \nnorth\u2013south trunk road providing access of central Kyrgyz Republic to the rest of the country \nand beyond. Similarly, CAREC Corridor 3 connects the Russian Federation and Europe to the \nMiddle East and South Asia; it is the only direct link between the southern and northern parts of \nthe country, linking two major economic and agricultural hubs, the capital city of Bishkek and the \nsecond largest city of the country, Osh. Joining these two CAREC corridors will link the southern \nregions (Batken, Jalal-Abad, and Osh) with the northern regions (Chui, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, and \nTalas) through a faster and safer alternative route, and facilitate further access to international \nmarkets.8 \n \n7.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  road  network  is  one  of  its  most  valuable  public  assets.  \nTo  maintain  this  network  systematically,  efficiently,  and  effectively,  it  is  necessary  to  \n(i) strengthen maintenance financing, (ii) improve road data collection and management, and  \n(iii) optimize road maintenance works. To this end, the project will introduce an appropriate \nRAMS to optimize the allocation of resources for the management, operation, preservation, and \nenhancement of road infrastructure. The RAMS will initially only cover part of the road network \nto allow the MOTR to gain experience. The system will integrate related pavement management \nsystem  work  initiated  by  the  World  Bank,9 and  a  bridge  and  tunnel  management  system \nintroduced by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).10 \n  \n8.  The rehabilitation of this connector road is consistent with the government\u2019s priority of \nproviding an alternate means of accessing national and regional connectivity, as stated in the \nNational Strategy of Sustainable Development, 2013\u20132017 (footnote 2). It is also aligned with \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and11 Midterm Review of Strategy 2020;12 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for the Kyrgyz Republic.13 ADB provided the project design advance \n(PDA) of up to $3 million in 2015 for preparing detailed engineering designs.14 The related \nworks contracts will start tendering in October 2016, and will be awarded when the proposed \nloan and grant are declared effective. \n \n \n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  World Bank. 2014.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  project  impact,  which  is  aligned  with  the  National  Sustainable  Development \nStrategy, 2013\u20132017, will be enhanced regional and national connectivity. The outcome will be \nimproved efficiency and safer movement of goods and people. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The outputs to be financed by ADB and the government are as follows: \n \n(i)  rehabilitated  road  from  Epkin  village  to  Bashkugandy  village  70  km  long  \n(distance marker [Km] 89\u2013Km 159) that incorporates specific features for road \nsafety and climate change adaptation; and \n(ii)  strengthened  institutional  capacity,  including  consulting  services  for  detailed \ndesign, 15  construction  supervision,  project  management,  project  auditing, \nsafeguards support, the preparation and implementation of the RAMS,16 and a \nreview of pilot performance-based maintenance contracting. \n \n11.  In addition, (i) 91 km of road from Aral village to CAREC Corridor 3 via the Suusamyr \nvalley (Km 195\u2013Km 286) will be rehabilitated and cofinanced by the Eurasian Development \nBank (EDB) and the government; and (ii) 24 km of road from Bashkugandy village to Jyldyz \nvillage (Km 159\u2013Km 183) will be rehabilitated and cofinanced by the Islamic Development Bank \n(IDB), the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), and the government. ADB will not administer any \nof the cofinancing funds. The financing partners will implement and administer their assigned \ncomponents parallel to the ADB-financed project using their own policies, procedures, and \nguidelines. The combined efforts of the various international financial institutions will improve \nthe network overall, not just a single corridor. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost approximately $114.35 million, including taxes and \nduties, to be financed by ADB and the government. The project investment plan is in Table 1.17 \n \n                                                \n15 ADB approved a $3 million Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant as a PDA for the CAREC Corridors 1 and 3 \nConnector Road Project on 2 June 2015 to finance detailed design. \n16 Road Asset Management System Review (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Detailed cost estimates by ADB and the government can be found in section 4 of the Project Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

The  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR41,905,000, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $36.72 million, both from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project.18 The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft financing \nagreement. The government will provide $19.24 million in counterpart funding to cover taxes \nand duties related to all civil works, goods, and consulting services. The financing plan is in \nTable 2. On the effective date of the proposed financing agreement, the amount of the advance \ndisbursed from the  PDA  grant  account  (para.  8)  by  such  date  will  be  cancelled from the \nproposed grant amount, and the PDA grant account will be closed. \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe latest debt sustainability analysis determined that the Kyrgyz Republic had a moderate risk of debt distress \nand was, therefore, eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n ", "5 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount   Share of Total  \n  \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank       \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)a  36.72     32.0 \n \nSpecial Funds resources (loan)  58.39  51.0 \n \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic  19.24  17.0 \n \n   Total     114.35     100.0 \na  Includes a $3 million project design advance approved in 2015. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  It is estimated that the EDB-financed section will comprise $85.00 million from the EDB \nand $22.02 million from the government; and that the IDB- and SFD-financed section will \ncomprise  $12  million  from  the  IDB,  $20  million  from  the  SFD,  and  $7  million  from  the \ngovernment.  The  combined  investment  of  $260.37  million  will  enable  network-wide \nimprovements. \n \n15.  Due to limited funding, it was not possible to finance all of the sections studied under the \nproject preparatory technical assistance in 2016. Two road sections totaling 67 km (Balykchy \nvillage\u2013Km  43  and  Kochkor  village\u2013Epkin  village)  will  be  considered  for  additional  ADB \nfinancing in 2017. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The MOTR will be the executing agency. It has implemented all development partner-\nfinanced road projects since 1995, and has accumulated considerable experience. The MOTR\u2019s \nInvestment  Projects  Implementation  Group  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation \nactivities.19 Construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  the  engineer  for  the \nconstruction contract. RAMS consultants will be contracted separately to design and implement \nthe RAMS. The EDB will make separate arrangements to finance the implementation of the \nEDB-financed section, while the IDB and SFD have their own separate project implementation \nunit. \n \n17.  The  implementation  arrangements  for  the  ADB-financed  section  are  summarized  in \nTable 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).20 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n(ADB-financed Epkin village\u2013Bashkugandy village road section only) \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  31 January 2017\u201331 July 2021  \nEstimated completion date  31 January 2022 (loan and grant closing date) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance, deputy minister (chair) \nHead of Public Investment Program, Technical Assistance, and \nForeign Aid Department (member) \nHead of Investment Projects Implementation Division (member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Roads \n                                                \n19 The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group is funded  by  multiple  development partners such  as  ADB,  \nthe China Exim Bank, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nAspects   Arrangements \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  Investment project implementation group \n(iv) Implementation unit  Bishkek, 40 staff \nProcurement  International  1 civil works contract  $72.00 million \ncompetitive bidding \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 1 construction supervision  $3.26 million \nbased selection  (301 person-months)   \n1 road asset management   \n(191 person-months)  $2.41 million \nLeast-cost selection  Financial audit  $0.10 million \nIndividual consultants  Project management  $1.57 million \n(1,080 person-months)   \n2 performance-based  $0.34 million \nmaintenance contact \nspecialists \n(18 person-months) \nAdvance contracting  Construction supervision consultant and road asset maintenance \nsystem services.

To continue the preparation of the remaining detailed engineering designs, after the PDA \naccount is closed, the funding source of the consultants engaged for this purpose (paras. 8 and \n13) will be shifted from the PDA to the proposed grant. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Preliminary engineering designs have been prepared based on topographical surveys \nand geotechnical investigations, as well as pavement, drainage structure, and bridge condition \nsurveys. International standards were applied to compensate for any shortcomings in national \nstandards. The ADB-financed road section (Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy) is a two-lane road with a \npavement width of 6\u20138 meters (m), and a mainly asphalt concrete surface in poor condition. \nAbout 70% of the paved areas are in an unsatisfactory condition with corrugations, cracks, and \nedge breaks, and some sections have already deteriorated to gravel. The average roughness \nindex is 8.33 m/km. \n \n20.  The project road will be upgraded to a category II standard, with two paved asphalt \ntravel lanes 3.75 m wide, paved shoulders 0.75 m wide, and unpaved shoulders 3.00 m wide. \nThe town passages in the Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy road, which are 5.3 km long, will meet the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s design standard for settlement roads. In addition, six bridges will be replaced \nand two bridges repaired and widened, with a total bridge length of 123.8 m between the two \nvillages. Road safety enhancements, such as guardrails, road signs, sidewalks, pedestrian \ncrossings, pavement markings, and other safety devices, will be provided. The project design \nincorporates feasible climate change adaptation and disaster risks measures. \n \n ", "7 \n \n21.  RAMS activities recently conducted in the country were assessed. The proposed RAMS \nwill build upon a bridge and tunnel system developed with the support of JICA, and a basic \npavement management system developed by the World Bank. The RAMS will be designed and \nimplemented component-by-component, with the support of strong institutional development, \ntraining, and data collection. The first road network covered by the RAMS will include the \nCAREC road network in the Kyrgyz Republic. The aim of this approach is to demonstrate the \nsystem\u2019s benefits with a small-scale pilot, and then expand it further once the system is set up. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic assessment. The project will lower transport costs, increase travel speeds, \nand improve road safety outcomes for international and national traffic on the CAREC Transport \nCorridors 1 and 3 Connector Road. The project\u2019s economic evaluation was undertaken using \n21\nthe highway development and management model  and following ADB's Guidelines for the \n 22\nEconomic Analysis of Projects.  The road sections to be financed by ADB, the EDB, and the \nIDB and SFD were all found to be economically viable, having a combined economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 24.9%. The estimated EIRR for the ADB-financed Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy \nroad section is 28.5%. The high EIRR reflects high traffic volumes and the poor state of the \nroads without the project. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the project would remain viable even if \nthe envisaged project costs increase or benefits decrease. \n \n23.  Financial  sustainability.  The  road  maintenance  budget  allocation  in  2016  was \nassessed as sufficient to meet the maintenance needs of the international roads maintained by \nthe MOTR; the government is committed to maintaining a road maintenance budget at a similar \nlevel. It is thus reasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet the project road\u2019s \nmaintenance  costs.  Once  the  project  road  is  completed,  the  MOTR  will  classify  it  as  an \ninternational corridor subject to priority operation and maintenance, and provide necessary \nfunding from the second year of the road\u2019s operation. In addition, when the RAMS is in place,  \nit will help the government utilize its maintenance budget better by prioritizing critical road \nsections.23 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Institutional  capacity.  ADB  has  helped  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  rehabilitate  CAREC \nCorridors 1 and 3, two regional corridors important for domestic and international travel, which \nconnect economic and population centers in the north and south of the country via its capital, \nBishkek. The Investment Projects Implementation Group has been implementing ADB-funded \nprojects since 1996, and has delivered more than 13 ADB road projects, with a total cost of \nmore  than  $468  million.  The  group\u2019s  staff  has  adequate  knowledge,  understanding,  and \nexperience with ADB procedures to manage the project. \n \n25.  Financial  management.  The  implementation  group\u2019s  capacity  for  project  financial \naccounting is satisfactory, and it has a proven track record in ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. \nSeparate project records and accounts will be maintained. The project accounts and related \nfinancial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international \nauditing standards. The pre-mitigation risk rating assigned to the project is moderate. Project \n                                                \n21 World Road Association. 2002. HDM-4 Version 2.

Procurement.  Master  bid  documents  were  prepared  during  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance stage. The recruitment of construction supervision consultants and RAMS \nconsultants commenced in August 2016. Tendering for the civil works contracts is expected to \ncommence in October 2016. The procurement risk assessment has been carried out. ADB will \ncontinue to train and support the MOTR procurement team and tender committee. ADB and the \nMOTR  will  conduct  capacity  strengthening  activities  with  a  focus  on  identifying  conflict  of \ninterest situations and detecting collusion and other fraudulent and corrupt behaviors. \n \n27.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MOTR. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The project is expected to help reduce poverty by improving the transport of goods and \npeople as well as access to services, thereby stimulating economic activities. The project will \nalso benefit local residents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction and reducing \ntransport costs and travel times. Social and poverty assessments are in the Summary Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy.24 The project is classified as a general intervention, with no \ndirect poverty reduction component. It will benefit poor people in the project area by improving \ntransport conditions and enabling better access to social services. The project design includes a \nmatrix  summarizing  actions  related  to  this  objective.  The  civil  works  contract  will  require \ncontractors  to  (i)  comply  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  applicable  labor  laws  and  related \ninternational treaty obligations, and not use child labor; (ii) provide safe working conditions and \nseparate sanitation facilities for male and female workers; (iii) provide equal wages to male and \nfemale workers for work of equal value; (iv) provide employment opportunities for women;  \n(v) carry out HIV/AIDS, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention and awareness programs \nin workers\u2019 campsites; and (vi) construct toilets along the project road. \n \nE.  Safeguards25 \n29.  Environment. The project is classified as category B under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  Three  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan, have been prepared for each project section financed by  \n(i) ADB, (ii) the EDB, and (iii) the IDB and SFD.26 Impacts, which will be mostly related to \nconstruction  work,  are  expected  to  be  limited  in  magnitude,  short-term  in  nature,  and \nmitigatable. They include (i) noise, dust, vehicle emissions, and vibration (these are especially \nsignificant for settlements along the road and sensitive receptors such as schools, hospitals, \nmosques, cemeteries, and other culturally historic objects); (ii) impacts on water courses and \nrivers due to bridge rehabilitation and construction works along the rivers; (iii) impacts from the \n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 For the EDB- and IDB- and SFD-financed road sections, the social and environmental assessment and planning, \nsafeguard documentation, consultation, and disclosure requirements were conducted to satisfy ADB's Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. An IEE report and land acquisition and resettlement plan for the EDB- and IDB- and SFD-\nfinanced road sections were prepared and disclosed on 22 July 2016. During implementation, the EDB, IDB, and \nSFD shall be responsible for (i) ensuring that activities carried out in connection with their financed sections comply \nwith their safeguard requirements, and (ii) resolving any complaints relating to these sections. \n26 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \ntransportation of material from borrow sites; (iv) impacts of tree-cutting along the road due to \nsite-clearance  activities;  (v)  impacts  from  asphalt  plants  and  aggregate  crushers;  and  \n(vi)  impacts  from  contractors'  work  camps.  The  impacts  have  been  divided  into  design, \nconstruction, and operation phase impacts. The project will finance the cost of implementing the \nenvironmental management plan\u2014the construction contracts will include the costs of mitigation \nmeasures, and the consulting service of the construction supervision consultants will include the \ncost of environmental monitoring.  \n   \n30.  Resettlement. Civil works associated with road construction and rehabilitation will entail \nsome  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  as  well  as  some  effects  on \nlivelihoods. Based on the three draft land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) prepared \nseparately for each project section, the project is categorized as category B for involuntary \nresettlement safeguards.27 Approximately 251 affected households, comprising 940 displaced \npersons, will experience permanent or temporary land acquisition. Six affected households will \nbe physically displaced, 12 affected households will be significantly impacted, and 57 affected \nhouseholds are deemed vulnerable. The ADB-financed section will affect only 48 households, \ncomprising  180  displaced  persons;  no  affected  household  will  be  physically  displaced,  \none affected household will be significantly impacted, and 22 households will be vulnerable.  \nThe vast majority of affected households will experience minor impacts, such as the loss of \ntrees, fences, walls, and minor structures in sections that encroach upon the road right-of-way. \nThe LARPs prepared for each section comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and the \nMOTR will be responsible for meeting ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements in the ADB-financed \nsection. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, in the project area, and the project will be classified as category C for \nindigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The  project  risks  are  considered  manageable  through  the  prescribed  mitigating \nmeasures, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of \nmitigation.  Major  project  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in project  The project design advance for detailed design was approved, and the \nimplementation  consultants mobilized in February 2016.
