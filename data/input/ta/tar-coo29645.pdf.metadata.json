INTRODUCTION\n1. During  the  Consultative  Group  meeting  involving  the  major  funding  agencies  in\nRarotonga in July 2001, the Government of the Cook Islands asked for assistance to promote\nemployment-generating activities and improve health and education facilities outside Rarotonga\n(in the outer islands).1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was requested to take the lead role.\n2. The Fact-Finding Mission for this technical assistance (TA) from ADB visited the Cook\nIslands between 13 and 20 September 2001.2  The Mission and the Government agreed on the\nneed  for  assistance  to  formulate  an  outer  islands  development  program  (OIDP)  and  to\ndetermine if an outer islands development trust fund (OIDTF) is the most effective way to deliver\nadditional resources for the economic and social development of the outer island communities.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The Cook Islands comprises 15 islands and atolls spread over an exclusive economic\nzone of nearly two million square kilometers in the southern Pacific Ocean. The islands are\ndivided geographically into the northern and southern groups. The islands of the southern\ngroup, including Rarotonga, the capital island, are mostly volcanic. The islands of the northern\ngroup are mostly atolls.\n4. The financial and logistical problems of adequately serving the scattered and isolated\nouter islands with a low population have resulted in significant disparities in the levels of\ndevelopment between Rarotonga and many of the outer islands. The outer islands suffer from\nundeveloped  services  and  lack  of  resources  to  sustain  adequate  levels  of  infrastructure\nmaintenance. The disparity of service and infrastructure is one of the principal reasons for a\npopulation drift from the outer islands to Rarotonga, and overseas.\n5. As a result, Rarotonga maintains the bulk of the economically active population, with\nmales outnumbering females, while the outer islands have a higher share of women, children,\nand the elderly. The standard of education is declining, with notable differences among the\nislands. The 1999 New Zealand School Certificate results were the worst on record since\nanalysis began in 1994. The average \"pass\" rate3 for 1994-1999 was 31 percent in Rarotonga\nand only 22 percent in the outer islands. Furthermore, the results of the 2000 Standard Tests of\nAchievement for English competency for primary schools was 6.21 for Rarotonga, 4.67 for the\nsouthern islands, and 3.38 for the northern islands.4\n6. The process toward devolution of responsibility to the outer islands to reduce disparities\nand population drift is not new. The 1966 Local Government Act established island, district, and\nvillage councils and committees. In 1976, local governments received further autonomy. In\n1987, the Outer Islands Local Government Act refined the functions of the island councils to\nallow them to administer various ordinances and by-laws applicable to their island, assist in\ncoordinating  social  and  economic  development  on  the  island,  and  assist  the  national\nGovernment in good governance of the island.\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 June 2001.\n2 This TA  is a firm project in the 2001 assistance program.\n3 Proportion of the Cook Islands students' paper achieving a mark of 50 percent or higher.\n4 Education Statistics Digest 2000. Rarotonga, September 2000.", "2\n7. In 1994, the Ministry of Outer Islands Development was established as the vehicle\nthrough which phased decentralization could take place, and responsibility for financing and\nadministering outer island services devolved from line ministries and departments to the island\ncouncils. In 1998, however, the island mayors concerned with progress initiated a mayoral\nforum process. This provided an opportunity to begin meaningful dialogue with the national\nGovernment on the devolution and development issues.\n8. A major outcome was the setting up of the Office of the Minister of Island Affairs (OMIA)\nin July 2000 to coordinate and facilitate the outer island empowerment process through the\nprovision  of  policy  advice  and  information,  infrastructure  development,  and  specific  project\nproposals. Revised structures were established for the devolution of power to the islands. Island\nsecretaries appointed under the Public Service Act replaced chief executive officers. The island\nsecretaries  must  perform  under  a  performance  agreement  with  the  mayor  and  the  island\ncouncil. Under this arrangement, the mayors have major responsibilities.\n9. Decentralization  is  part  of  the  Government's  national  development  strategy.  The\nGovernment established three overarching goals: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability to\nsustain private sector growth, (ii) empowering people of the outer islands by advancing the\nprinciples of good governance, and (iii) advancing social justice through equal access to basic\nservices and reduction of national disparities. The Government also identified five strategic\npriorities: (i) economic sustainability, (ii) outer island empowerment, (iii) social cohesiveness, (iv)\ninfrastructure advancement, and (v) good governance. These priorities could represent the\nbasis for an OIDP reform matrix aimed at \"removal of obstacles and unfairness in society by a\nprocess of review and reform.\"5\n10. Outer island development is essential to place such countries as the Cook Islands on a\nsustainable economic, social, and demographic growth path. In 1999, ADB provided Tuvalu with\nan  Island  Development  Program  loan6  to  support  devolution  to  the  local  governments  by\ncreating  an  improved  enabling  environment  for  island  development  and  by  providing  a\nsignificant level of development finance for island development. The Cook Islands authorities\nare particularly interested in the development of a social trust fund for island development to\nfinance the cost of the proposed policy reforms. Other funding agencies expressed interest in\nthe trust fund mechanism and in the possibility of contributing to its principal when established.\nThe task now is to investigate whether a trust fund can be successfully adapted to island\ndevelopment in the Cook Islands as it was in Tuvalu.7\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n11. The TA will assist the Government to formulate an OIDP. The proposed program will be\ndesigned to increase employment opportunities and improve living standards on the outer\nislands.  The  TA  will  also  assess  the  feasibility  of  an  OIDTF  for  island  development  and\nequitable  growth  as  a  way  to  channel  resources  for  improving  social  and  economic\ninfrastructures  on  the  outer  islands.  The  OIDTF  will  be  designed  as  a  sustainable,  low\ntransaction-cost, flexible, and demand-driven mechanism to channel resources to the islands for\n                  \n5 Budget Policy Statement of 2001/2002.

Scope\n12. The TA will engage a team of international and domestic consultants who, together with\nthe support of counterpart staff, will study all aspects of outer island development financing and\nformulate a solution suitable for external financing. The TA will be divided into two phases.\n13. Phase 1 will comprise a review of the social and economic situation in the outer islands\nof the Cook Islands, identification of a program for social and economic development, and\nassessment  of  the  various  technically  feasible  options  available  to  provide  incremental\nresources. In particular, during phase 1, the consultants and counterpart staff will (i) review the\nsocial and economic situation in the outer islands of the Cook Islands, (ii) develop a social and\neconomic development program, and (iii) in strict coordination with the other major assistance\nagencies, assess various technically feasible options for providing incremental resources to the\nlocal communities for island development. This will be undertaken in the overall context of the\ncountry's macroeconomic framework and the government's budgetary process/system.\n14. During phase 2, the consultants and counterpart staff will (i) utilize the mass media (e.g.,\nlocal  television)  to  inform  island  communities  of  the  proposed  program  and  subsequently\norganize  participatory  workshops  to  discuss  and  prepare  the  OIDP;  (ii)  evaluate  social,\ncommunity, and gender constraints; (iii) advise the Government on the participatory system\nrequired; (iv) finalize the institutional structure and legal framework of the proposed OIDTF; and\n(v) identify capacity-building needs.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $315,000  equivalent,  comprising  $197,000  as  foreign\nexchange cost and $118,000 equivalent as local currency cost. ADB will provide $250,000\nequivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $53,000  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency costs. The financing will be provided on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund,\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government contribution of $65,000 equivalent covers\nthe remuneration of counterpart staff, including per diems, office accommodation and utilities,\nand in-country training (Appendix 2). The Government has been informed that approval of the\nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n16. The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management\n(MFEM), and OMIA will implement the study. The study will be steered by a committee made up\nof a small group of executives from MFEM, OMIA, and the Office of the Prime Minister. Local\ngovernments will be consulted by the steering committee and OMIA. The chief executive officer\nof OMIA will act as the focal point for the consulting team and provide coordination between the\nGovernment,  its  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  the  consultants.  MFEM  and\nOMIA counterpart staff will assist the consultants and become fully familiar with the program\ndetails.\n17. The TA will be carried out by a team of international and domestic consultants from a\nfirm to be selected using simplified technical procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic", "4\nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  have  extensive  experience  in  policy  reform  for  rural\ndevelopment, social development and participation, trust funds, and legislative drafting. The\ninternational  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  a  total  of  6  person-months,  and  domestic\nconsultants for 6 person-months to facilitate community inclusion and participation. Computers\nand office equipment will be procured in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.\n18. The TA is expected to begin in February 2002 and be completed by February 2003. The\ntwo phases will be separated by two months to enable the Government and ADB to review the\nconsultants' findings and make preliminary recommendations on the investment program and\npolicy and regulatory reform. Before phase 2 starts, a tripartite meeting will be held in Rarotonga\nwith the Government, ADB, and the consultants to discuss the phase 1 findings and to agree on\nthe extent of analysis required to formulate the OIDP.\n19. The consultants will be briefed by ADB in Manila or Rarotonga at the start of the TA. The\noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will submit an inception report at\nthe end of the first month after mobilization, brief monthly reports, an interim report at the\ncompletion of phase 1, a draft final report at the completion of phase 2, and a final report. The\nfinal report, taking into account comments of the Government and ADB, will be submitted within\none month of receipt of the comments.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Cook Islands in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 for the purpose of Preparing the Outer Islands\nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1\nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\nEconomic and social Reduce population National census Natural disasters\ndevelopment of the drift to Rarotonga and\nouter island overseas.
