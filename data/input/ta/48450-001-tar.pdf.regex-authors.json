INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the 2015\u20132017 \nwork program of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED), with effect from 11 December \n2014.1  The  IED  program  focuses  on  high-level  evaluations2  that  complement  project-level \nevaluations, and gives a strategic perspective on ADB operations and direction. This research and \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  supports  the  2015\u20132017  program  cycle, \nparticularly for products due from 2016.3 It will fund a set of evaluations from IED\u2019s (i) operational \nprogram (e.g., country assistance program evaluations [CAPEs]); and (ii) knowledge program \n(i.e., sector, thematic and corporate evaluations, impact evaluations, and topical working papers). \nThe TA also supports knowledge sharing and outreach to maximize the usefulness and impact of \nevaluations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  High-level evaluations give feedback on the effectiveness of ADB strategies, policies, \nprocesses, and operations to ADB Management and the Board.4  This feedback is required to \nprovide accountability to ADB\u2019s stakeholders and to strengthen ADB as a learning organization. \n \n3.  Effective implementation of safeguards. The corporate evaluation study (CES) on the \nSafeguards Operational Review: ADB Processes, Portfolio, Country Systems, and Financial \nIntermediaries  was  discussed  by  the  Development  Effectiveness  Committee  (DEC)  on \n7 November 2014.5 The scope was limited but drew wide attention given the recently started \nconsultation  process  regarding  the  update  of  the  World  Bank  safeguards  policy,  and  the \nestablishment of two new development banks with operations in Asia\u2014the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank and the Brazil\u2013Russian Federation\u2013India\u2013People\u2019s Republic of China\u2013South \nAfrica (BRICS) bank. In 2015/2016, IED will build on this review to conduct a more results-\noriented assessment of the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s safeguard implementation, with emphasis on \nthe effectiveness of the changes introduced by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n4.  The  CES  will  include  extensive  field  work  to  check  the  results  of  safeguard \nimplementation. The evaluation is mandated by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and will take \nplace 5 years after the start of its implementation in 2010. Since few projects that started under \n                                                \n1  This is driven by several key considerations: (i) providing timely inputs to formulating future ADB policies, \nstrategies, and programs; (ii) providing real-time feedback during loan processing and implementation; (iii) building \nevaluation capacity, both within and outside ADB; and (iv) producing strategically relevant knowledge on emerging \nregional development issues to inform ADB operations and development policies in member countries. \n2  Evaluations include thematic, corporate, real-time, and impact evaluation studies; evaluation knowledge studies; \nand country and regional evaluations. IED. 2014. Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s DEC Approved Work \nProgram, 2015\u22122017 http://wcm.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/110939/wp-2015-2017.pdf \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 February 2015. \n4  See ADB. 2009. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila (http://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2020-working-asia-and-pacific-free-poverty); ADB. 2014. Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020:  Meeting  the  Challenges  of  a  Transforming  Asia  and  Pacific.  Manila \n(http://www.adb.org/about/strategy-2020-mid-term-review); and ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nAction Plan. Manila (http://www.adb.org/documents/midterm-review-strategy-2020-action-plan). \n5  IED carried out the operational review after 3 years in line with ADB\u2019s commitment to do so when safeguard \npolicies were consolidated into ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The operational review found that a \nproper system for avoiding or mitigating the environmental and social risks of ADB-funded projects is in place, and \noffered proposals for change. With important improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, the safeguard system \nat ADB would be the type that can be trusted to care for social and environmental outcomes in countries. IED. \n2014. Corporate Evaluation Study: Safeguards Operational Review\u2014ADB Processes, Portfolio, Country Systems, \nand  Financial  Intermediation.  Manila  (http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguards-operational-review-adb-\nprocesses-portfolio-country-systems-and-financial-interm?ref=site/evaluation/resources). \n ", "2 \n \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement will be completed by 2015, the evaluation will take a broader \nview of safeguard implementation and may include case studies of projects started before \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, but implemented after 2009 with much higher numbers of \nsafeguard specialists in ADB and greater safeguard experience. \n \n \n5. Promoting  sustainable  transport.  The  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  (STI) \nOperational Plan (2010) aims to steer ADB transport sector operations and align these with \nStrategy 2020 by adopting sustainable transport as a guiding principle.6 The thematic evaluation \nstudy (TES) will look at the STI Operational Plan and its execution. It will attempt to determine \nhow effectively ADB integrated transport sector road maps in country partnership strategies \n(CPSs) and how effectively these maps were used to design sustainable transport operations.  \n \n6.  The study will also assess shifts in the transport lending pipeline to accommodate major \nchanges proposed by the STI Operational Plan. Initial results will be checked, notably the extent \nto  which  the  new  transport  projects  are  contributing  to  intended  impacts,  and  achieved \noutcomes and outputs. Factors hindering the plan will be assessed, notably good governance \nand  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks.  Finally,  the  TES  will  analyze  how  the  STI  can  be \nstrengthened to enhance development effectiveness.   \n \n7.  Ensuring  additionality  of  private  sector  operations.  Strategy  2020  promotes  a \nsignificant expansion of private sector operations (PSO) to generate greater economic growth in \nAsia and the Pacific. ADB assumes greater risks and acts as a catalyst for investments that the \nprivate sector might not be willing to make on its own. The CES will assess value added by ADB \nin its PSO in terms of providing funding or catalyzing other funding, and improving the risk \nprofile, design, functioning, and development impact of supported investments. \n \n8.  Impact evaluation. IED  will do one impact evaluation per  year to understand and \nassess development effectiveness in select priority areas of ADB operations. This TA supports \nan evaluation of the impact of urban water supply and sanitation. After more than a decade in \npursuit of the Millennium Development Goals, gains have been made in reducing poverty, and \nimproving health and access to clean water.7 Achievement of the global target for access to \nclean water was 89% in 2012, and 70% for access to sanitation.Yet the figures mask significant \n \ndifferences in access within countries and areas, and in the quality of services provided. The \nimpact evaluation will provide an in-depth assessment of various impacts from project services, \nincluding the health, and well-being of the population. \n \n9.  Country  assistance  evaluations.  The  TA  will  fund  CAPEs  and  CPS  final  review \nvalidations. These will provide an objective assessment and rating of ADB support, and identify \nlessons and recommendations for new CPSs. \n \n10.  Strengthening evaluation usage. IED\u2019s knowledge sharing, outreach, and partnerships \nare anchored in (i) a good outreach program in place; (ii) use of participatory communication \nchannels and new communication approaches for learning, such as interactive knowledge-\nsharing  events  to  communicate  evaluation  findings;  and  (iii)  a  responsive  database  for \nevaluation information.  \n \n                                                \n6  It indicates major directions of change and arrangements for establishing partnerships to support implementation. \n7  The Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals as they expire in \n2015, will ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation, i.e., Goal 6. Sustainable \nDevelopment  Knowledge  Platform.  Open  Working  Group  proposal  for  Sustainable  Development  Goals. \nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/focussdgs.html ", "3 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  will  be  improved  development  effectiveness  of  ADB  operations,  policies, \nstrategies, and business processes. The outcome will be increased use of evaluation findings, \nlessons, and recommendations by the ADB Board of Directors and its DEC, by ADB Management \nand operations staff, and by developing member country (DMC) agencies and practitioners, and \nother interested parties in the public. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA  will  support  at  least  ten  evaluations  along  with  outreach  and  database  and \ninformation services-related activities. An evaluation approach paper (EAP)  will be prepared \nbefore an evaluation study begins. It will detail the rationale, objective and scope, methodologies \nto be used, resource requirements, terms of reference for consultants, and dissemination plan. A \nconcept paper may be prepared when diagnostic work is needed prior to finalizing an EAP or \nwhen a country sector assessment is more conveniently done ahead of the CAPE it will inform. \nConsultant recruitment may begin when either a draft EAP or a concept paper is approved by \nIED\u2019s director general for interdepartmental review.8 \n13.  High-level evaluations are intended to give inputs for milestone reviews and decisions by \nADB\u2019s  Board  and  Management,  and  IED  schedules  them  within  relevant  time  frames.  A \ncompleted study is circulated to the Board and Management and normally discussed by the DEC. \n14.  Country assistance program evaluations and validations of country partnership \nstrategy final reviews. IED\u2019s operational program is directly linked to ADB country operations.9 It \ncomprises CAPEs and validations of CPS final reviews, provided IED is given sufficient notice of \nthe CPS timing to support.10 This TA will fund at least one CAPE (Sri Lanka) and five validations \n(Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Uzbekistan). These will evaluate \nADB country support; and cover ADB strategy, policy dialogue, completed and ongoing projects \nand TA, and ADB performance. They also provide ADB and its DMCs with an evaluative basis for \nfuture  CPSs.  When  appropriate,  sector  assessments  will  provide  inputs  by  evaluating  ADB \nperformance in a given sector, focusing on strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed \nprojects, and TA performance. The TA will also support validations of completed project and/or \nprogram completion reports to inform the larger country and sector assessments. \n \n15.  Effectiveness  of  safeguards  implementation,  phase  2.  The  next  phase  of  the \nsafeguards assessment will provide further insights from in-depth field research of a purposive \nsample of ADB-supported projects. IED will also examine the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s safeguards \nimplementation. The evaluation will examine the extent to which (i) any potentially adverse \nimpacts of ADB-supported projects have been (or will  likely be) avoided, mitigated and/or \n                                                \n8 IED also considers consultant recruitment appropriate where concept papers are approved (i)  for sector or \nthematic assessments to be done prior to, or in the context of, CAPEs; and (ii) to hire consultants for diagnostic \nwork or background papers in the context of other evaluations. \n9  Evaluation guidelines are being updated: (i) CAPE and validation of CPS final reviews by March  2015; (ii) \nperformance evaluation reports for sovereign operations by the fourth quarter of 2015; and (iii) validation reports on \nproject or program completion reports and extended annual review reports by the fourth quarter of 2015.  \n10 A CAPE is conducted prior to a new CPS, but not all CPSs are preceded by one. If IED\u2019s work program does not \ninclude a CAPE for a DMC that is due for a new CPS, then IED will validate the CPS final review. The relevant \nvalidation report then serves as a CAPE equivalent for purposes of CPS preparation. IED should be advised of the \ntiming of the final review before its incoming work program is finalized. It needs at least 5 months to do a validation. ", "4 \n \nminimized  where  avoidance  has  not  been  possible,  and  (ii) ADB\u2019s  safeguard  efforts  have \nbrought about (or likely to bring about) positive development outcomes. The study will examine \nthe costs and benefits of safeguards, look at category A and B projects, and examine some \nfinancial intermediary projects. Projects will be selected from East Asia, Central and West Asia, \nSouth  Asia,  and  Southeast  Asia  (possibly  Cambodia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nKazakhstan, and Sri Lanka, which have more projects approved under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement that are advanced in implementation). It will adopt a mixed-methods framework; and \nwill be informed by documentation analysis, key informant interviews, pilot economic analysis, \nand site inspections. \n \n16.  Review of sustainable transport initiatives. The TES will examine  the relevance, \nresponsiveness, and effectiveness of ADB support to DMCs under its STI Operational Plan. It \nwill also identify good practices and draw lessons for the future. The study will cover sustainable \nroad transport (urban and non-urban), traffic management, transport management and policies, \nand rail transport. It will cover at least two regions and focus on the (i) extent to which CPSs \naimed to help the sustainability of transport infrastructure and services; (ii) extent to which \ncountries implemented policies and regulatory frameworks, financial mechanisms, and capacity-\nbuilding  activities  for  STIs;  (iii)  extent  to  which  these  measures  were  effective;  and  (iv) \ndeterminants of their success. The TES will conduct a desk review of operational documents for \nlending and nonlending support to the sector from 2009 to 2014. Perception surveys, country \ncase studies of selected sustainable transport projects, and key informant interviews with DMC \nstakeholders and development partners undertaking related sector work will also be conducted. \n \n17.  Additionality  of  private  sector  operations.  The  CES  will  concentrate  on  ADB \nadditionality in conjunction with nonsovereign loans and equity investments approved since \n2000.11 It will focus on (i) how ADB encourages value addition in its PSO\u2014in comparison with \nother multilateral development banks\u2014based on a review of pertinent corporate strategies, \ninstitutional incentives, and project approval documents; (ii) the extent to which it has achieved \nvalue addition based on a review of completed transactions, available evaluation reports, and \nfeedback from project sponsors, financiers, and other relevant stakeholders; and (iii) whether \nADB could do more to optimize its financial and nonfinancial value addition in nonsovereign \noperations based on feedback from private sector sponsors and financiers and a review of value \naddition achieved by similar multilateral financial institutions (Appendix 3, para. 16). \n \n18.  Impact evaluation. The TA will support at least one impact evaluation study (IES). This \nwill look at the development outcomes of select urban water supply projects in a DMC (possibly \nIndia  or  Viet  Nam),  depending  on  the  availability  of  a  well-structured  and  well-conducted \nhousehold survey, and provide evidence of the poverty impacts of water supply interventions. \nThe IES will use impact evaluation methods based on statistical and econometric analyses of \nquantitative  data  from  household  and  community  level  surveys,  both  existing  and  to  be \nconducted by the study. The study will identify counterfactuals from comparable nonparticipant \nareas. For additional insights on nonquantifiable variables and study robustness, it will collect \nqualitative information and integrate it into the quantitative analyses.  \n \n19.  Evaluation research and topical working papers. The TA will support sector and/or \nthematic assessments that help disseminate higher-level evaluations in the work program. These \ninclude selective ad hoc evaluative researches (or \u201cquick turnaround\u201d topical working papers) on \nhigh\u2212impact topics with strong potential implications for ADB\u2019s institutional policies and practices \nor of specific interest and relevance to DMCs. \n                                                \n11 Value addition through credit enhancement operations will be assessed under a separate evaluation due in 2016. ", "5 \n \n20.  Evaluation outreach, knowledge sharing, and partnerships. IED makes evaluation \nfeedback more accessible and influential (Supplementary Appendix). It will disclose, disseminate, \nand share results through (i) a publicly available lessons database; (ii) outreach activities like \nbriefings, presentations, and interactive learning events (i.e., training, seminars, and conferences) \non  completed  major  evaluations;  (iii)  preparation  and  publishing  of  syntheses,  briefs,  and \noccasional  papers  designed  to  widen  the  existing  readership;  and  (iv)  new  mediums  for \nknowledge sharing, such as online readers and tablets. The TA will also support cooperation with \ndevelopment partners (with operations in Asia and the Pacific) at the institutional, operational, \nand  country  levels.  These  comprise  contributions  to  international  evaluation  events  and \nactivities that focus on priority evaluation issues, promote learning, coordinate or harmonize \nevaluation practice, and strengthen evaluation capacity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The cost estimates and financing plan \nis in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise all \nplanned studies and/or knowledge-sharing and outreach activities. These will require the services \nof 42 international consultants (about 66 person-months) and 48 national consultants (about 122 \nperson-months). The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. More detailed terms of \nreference for each study will be developed for the EAP. ADB will engage consultants primarily on \nan  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). Lump-sum payments or output-based contracts will be considered for \nconsulting services. The need for specific services from consulting firms will be considered during \nthe preparation of the EAP. The TA may also fund seminars and conferences held either to \nacquire inputs for draft reports or to support learning and dissemination events.12 \n \n23.  TA  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). Tracking of study progress will be \nthrough internal monitoring sheets on key milestone events, mission back-to-office reports, and ad \nhoc presentations or consultations on evaluation findings. The TA outputs will be disseminated in \naccordance with IED\u2019s evaluation policy, particularly on public disclosure, dissemination, and \nlessons. The TA is scheduled to start on 15 July 2015, and expected to end by 31 December \n2018. Implementation arrangements will be flexible to accommodate alterations in IED\u2019s work \nprogram or changes in response to priorities under Strategy 2020 and funding provided by the \nAsian Development Fund. ADB will obtain a no objection from the DMC government before \nstarting any activity financed under this TA in the territory of that country. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n24.
