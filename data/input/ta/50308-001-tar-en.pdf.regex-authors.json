INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  build  the  capacity  of  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs) to promote and manage their sustainable economic \ndevelopment.1 The TA has been developed in response to the unique development contexts \nfacing  PDMCs,  including  a  heavy  reliance  on  external  concessional  sources  for  financing \ndevelopment.  The  TA  will  finance  a  fellows  program  for  mid-level  staff  in  executing  and \nimplementing agencies from PDMCs to support mutual learning and knowledge sharing, and \ncontribute to effective project design and implementation. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  PDMCs face a unique development context due to their small size, remoteness, internal \ndispersion, vulnerability to economic shocks, climate change, and natural disasters, as well as \ncomplex traditional institutional structures. Among other things, this context contributes to low \ninstitutional capacity, high aid dependence, and a strong need to tailor development approaches \nto the local context. \n \n3.  Many PDMCs are heavily reliant on Asian Development Bank (ADB) project financing in \na  number  of  areas,  notably  infrastructure,  as  well  as  TA  in  areas  such  as  public  sector \nmanagement and private sector development. Thinly stretched public administrations offer limited \nopportunities to build PDMC staff capacity. Heavy aid dependence means it is critical that PDMCs \nare able to effectively manage and engage with their major development partners, notably ADB. \nHowever, many PDMC officials have a limited understanding of ADB\u2019s policies, practices, and \nrole as a multilateral development bank. It is important for PDMCs to learn from development \nexperiences elsewhere, including within the Pacific region itself and in Asia. Further, it is essential \nthat ADB operations are highly responsive to the unique development context of the PDMCs and \nincorporate relevant local knowledge and insights as much as possible. \n \n4.  The fellows program is expected to help strengthen infrastructure development, public \nsector management, and private sector development, all of which are key strategic priorities for \nall PDMC governments and are aligned with the ADB country assistance strategies for the \nPDMCs. This includes those for Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste, and the Pacific \nApproach, 2016\u20132020, which serves as the operational framework of ADB for the Pacific region \nand the overall country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller Pacific island countries\u2014the Cook \nIslands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.2 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact will be aligned with the following impacts drawn from the Pacific Approach, \n2016\u20132020: \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n18 January 2017. \n2  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2   \n(i)  Costs reduced. The TA project will improve the availability, affordability, and \nreliability  of  energy,  information  communication  technology,  and  transport \ninfrastructure. \n(ii)  Risks  managed.  The  TA  project  will  support  greater  resilience  to  external \neconomic and financial shocks, climate change, and natural disasters. \n(iii)  Value  creation  enabled.  The  TA  project  will  help  in  facilitating  a  better \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development,  productive  activities,  decent  job \ncreation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation. \n \n6.  The outcome will be improved PDMC capacity to promote and manage sustainable \neconomic development. This will be measured through a survey of relevant staff in participating \norganizations and ADB. The survey will assess the extent to which respondents report improved \nindividual  and  organizational  capacity  in  the relevant field  and  enhanced  capacity to  work \neffectively  with  ADB  as  a  key  development  partner.  By  the  end  of  the  TA,  participating \norganizations should report a notable improvement in these areas. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  The  TA  will  finance  a  fellows  program  for  14  mid-level  staff  from  executing  and \nimplementing agencies in PDMCs. These fellows will gain professional work experience in ADB \noperations as well as contribute to ADB operations by applying their skills and insights from a \nPDMC perspective. The project team will select candidates with strong potential for capacity \ndevelopment based on their professional development needs, the organizational needs of their \nrespective agencies, and the economic development requirements of their respective countries. \nFellows will work under the guidance of designated ADB specialists on defined assignments, \nwhich may include (i) being a member of project teams, (ii) undertaking technical work related to \na project, and/or (iii) contributing to knowledge products and/or strategy development. Fellows \nmay  be  placed  in  both  the  Pacific  Department  (PARD)  as  well  as  other  ADB  operational \ndepartments in ADB headquarters in Manila, and/or in ADB resident mission offices, depending \non individual assignment requirements. A range of geographic assignments will be possible, \nincluding working on operations in the fellow\u2019s own country (particularly where seen as highly \nrelevant to outputs 2 and 3) as well as in other developing member countries in the Pacific region \nand elsewhere that offer strong opportunities for capacity development. \n \n8.  Output 1: Improved Pacific developing member country staff capacity, with gender-\nbalanced participation. Fellows will be given assignments in ADB operations that are of direct \nrelevance to their professional development needs. The fellow and supervising ADB specialist will \nwork together to define the terms of reference of the assignment, including specific professional \ndevelopment goals and objectives. \n \n9.  Output 2: Enhanced Pacific developing member country capacity to work effectively \nwith ADB. Fellow assignments will be designed to ensure participants gain experience and \nholistic exposure to ADB operations as it relates to their professional areas. How this is structured \nwill be determined on a case-by-case basis. For instance, fellows from finance and/or planning \nministries which are responsible for managing the relationship with ADB may focus on gaining an \nunderstanding  of  ADB  operations  through  participation  in  country  programming  exercises. \nAlternatively, fellows involved in particular sectors will gain a more focused understanding of ADB \napproaches within those sectors through involvement in the processing of sector projects. Fellows \nworking on targeted technical issues and knowledge products will gain exposure to the variety of \nADB approaches and thinking on these issues. \n \n ", "  3 \n10.  Output 3: Greater integration of Pacific developing member country knowledge into \nADB operations. Fellow assignments will be chosen and designed to ensure that ADB is able to \nbenefit from the inclusion of PDMC knowledge and expertise in project teams. This will include \nwork at the project, sector, country and/or regional program, and strategy development levels. \nAssignments where this is deemed as important will most likely be those that focus on the \nrespective PDMC of origin and/or where the fellow has technical expertise of relevance to another \nPDMC. \n \n11.  The  expected  benefits  of  the  TA  are  based  on  several  assumptions,  including  the \nfollowing: (i) selection of fellows is well-targeted to support PDMC national development needs, \n(ii) suitable candidates with at least minimal essential qualifications to benefit from the program \nand contribute to ADB project teams can be identified, and (iii) returning fellows remain in relevant \npositions following completion of the assignment. \n \n12.  The risks inherent in these assumptions will be actively managed through specific criteria \nused to select fellows and active management by the project teams, including project consultants. \nThe basis of selection will include the requirement for the sending organization to provide written \ncommitment to ADB that the fellow will remain in a position where the skills acquired under the \nprogram are of direct relevance for at least 2 years following their completion of the program. The \nfellow will be required to make a presentation on the outcomes and lessons from their assignment \nupon returning to their home organization to promote benefits at the organizational level. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Executing  agency  and  implementing  agency.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  and \nimplementing agency for the program. PARD will identify fellowship candidates and determine \nplacement opportunities. ADB\u2019s Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department and \noperations departments that participate as host departments will be the implementing agencies. \nPARD will be responsible for the administration and supervision of all outputs of the project, \nalthough  individual  specialists  from  relevant  operations  departments  will  be  designated  as \nsupervisors for each fellowship assignment. PARD resident missions and country teams will be \nresponsible for conducting outreach activities in the PDMCs. The project team will hire a part-time \nstrategic advisor and full-time program manager as consultants to support the project. \n \n15.  The project will support the participation of one fellow from each PDMC. The proposed \nbudget is sufficient for 14 6-month assignments (one from each PDMC). For each fellow, ADB \nwill provide one return air ticket, per diems, and travel insurance, and cover the costs for one \nmission (of about 7 days). ADB will determine the duration of each fellowship on a case-by-case \nbasis but they are envisioned to be about 6 months on average. Most fellowships will be carried \nout over a single continuous period although consideration will be given to structuring fellowships \nin several components where this is deemed relevant (e.g., to manage domestic work pressures), \npractical for the assignment, and cost-effective. ADB will determine the location of fellows on a \ncase-by-case basis with the majority likely to be placed in ADB headquarters in Manila and a \nlimited number in resident missions where deemed appropriate. Fellows will be supported with \ntailored briefing materials (collated and/or prepared under the project based on existing ADB \ntraining materials) with further guidance from supervising ADB specialists. Fellows will also have \n ", "4   \naccess to in-house ADB training where appropriate, relevant to the assignment, cost-effective, \nand  subject  to  approval  of  the  supervisor  and  consultation  with  BPMSD.  ADB  operations \ndepartments will contribute in kind through staff time to manage fellows as part of project teams. \n \n16.  The program will be structured to enable active learning and program improvement. In \nparticular, the program will be staggered, with PARD hosting an initial batch of 4\u20135 fellows. The \nproject  team  will  conduct  a  review  at  the  end  of  the  first  batch  to  identify  lessons  and \nimprovements needed before beginning the process of selecting future fellows. \n \n17.  Recruitment of consultants and procurement. The TA will finance a part-time strategic \nadvisor (international, 3 person-months, intermittent) to support the strategic management, and a \nfull-time program manager (national, 26 person-months) to support project management and \nadministration, including logistical and administrative support for fellows.3 Consultancy inputs will \nbe based in Manila. The consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Each individual memorandum of \nagreement with the fellows will be inputted as a \u201cV-contract\" in the TA information system. The \nprocurement of information technology equipment will be conducted in accordance with the \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and will meet the requirements of \nand be cleared by ADB\u2019s Office of Information Services and Technology. The consultants will \nadminister all equipment, seminars, and workshops.  \n \n18.  Implementation arrangements. The TA is expected to commence on 1 October 2017 \nand be completed on 31 December 2019. Detailed selection criteria, processes, and other \nadministrative arrangements are set out in the ADB Pacific Fellows Program Implementation \nGuidelines.4 Fellows will not be ADB staff and will remain employees of their home organizations. \nFellows will, however, be bound by ADB regulations and policies, similar to the ADB secondment \nand  internship  programs.  Upon  agreeing  to  a  fellowship  assignment,  a  memorandum  of \nagreement setting out the terms of the assignment will be signed between the head of the sending \nagency, ADB, and the individual fellow.5 \n \n19.  The project team will choose the fellows based on the following outline selection criteria: \n(i) nomination  from  the  relevant  PDMC  organization,  including  based  on  staff  capacity \ndevelopment prospects and individual and organizational development needs; (ii) endorsement \nof the relevant country and/or sector director sponsoring the fellow, including suitability (e.g., \ntechnical, professional relevance); (iii) identification of a specific development assignment of \nrelevance to the PDMC staff and/or organization and the relevant ADB country assistance and/or \nsector strategy; and (iv) agreement of the relevant ADB director to host the fellow, including based \non relevance and in-kind resourcing implications. The project team will target gender balance in \nthe  selection  of  participants,  although  it  is  recognized  that  practical  limitations  may  inhibit \nachieving this. The selection process will primarily be driven by ADB country team engagement \nwith both key counterpart organizations and potential host ADB departments, with support from \nthe strategic advisor. This is because of the need to match potential fellows with appropriate \nassignments, as well as take into account host department availability and interest in specific \nproposed fellows. \n \n                                                \n3  Outline Terms of Reference for Consultants (Appendix 3). \n4  ADB Pacific Fellows Program Implementation Guidelines (Supplementary Appendix 1).  \n5  ADB Pacific Fellows Program Memorandum of Agreement: Template (Supplementary Appendix 2). \n ", "  5 \n20.  Participating PDMC organizations will contribute in kind through the nomination of a staff \nmember to participate in the fellows program, including the payment of the fellow\u2019s usual salary \nand other employment benefits. ADB will require each fellow to prepare a written deliverable\u2014\nsuch as project documents, technical reports, and knowledge products, and strategy papers\u2014as \npart of their assignments. \n \n21.  PARD and the designated ADB specialists supervising the fellows will monitor the TA, with \nsupport from the project consultants. The project team will conduct a review at the end of the first \nbatch of fellows to identify lessons and ways to improve. The project team will conduct an \nevaluation through a survey completed by the participating fellows, their PDMC supervisors, and \nADB supervisors. Respondents will be surveyed at the end of the fellow assignment and 6 months \nlater to provide evidence on likely sustainability. The participants will conduct exit interviews with \nADB specialists and/or directors. The project team will disseminate survey results in aggregate \nform and incorporate the main lessons in the TA completion report. The project team will prepare \nan information brief highlighting the outcomes of the fellows program prior to TA completion to \npublicize the benefits of the program and seek cofinancing for its continuation and potential \nexpansion.
