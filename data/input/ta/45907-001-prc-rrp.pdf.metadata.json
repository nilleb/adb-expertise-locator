I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for a proposed loan \nfor CNY130 million for the Microfinance Wholesale Lending Facility in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC). The facility will be offered to participating partner banks to develop the wholesale \nlending market for microcredit companies (MCCs). The facility will promote access to credit for \nhouseholds and micro and small enterprises (MSEs), particularly those in rural areas.1 The \ninvestment will be funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.2 \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Sector Background \n2.  The outstanding economic performance of the PRC3 is accompanied by a number of \nserious imbalances\u2014between coastal and inland regions, between urban and rural areas, and \nbetween  high  demand  for  natural  resources  and  the  need  for  energy  efficiency  and \nenvironmental conservation. Balanced and inclusive growth is one of the main themes in the \ngovernment\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015).4 Development of inclusive finance has been \nseen by the government and by ADB as one of the key policy measures to achieve inclusive \ngrowth.5 The PRC banking system has played a dominant role in the financial market by \nmobilizing a large pool of deposits and providing an estimated 95% of corporate financing. \nHowever, many MSEs are facing serious difficulties in accessing credit.6 \n3.  Microfinance  in  the  PRC  is  at  an  early  stage  of  development.  There  were  no \ncommercially sustainable microfinance institutions (MFIs) in 2003.  In 2004, ADB partnered with \nthe People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC), the central bank, to develop MCCs as private-sector-owned \nand commercial MFIs through pilots in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and in Guizhou \nProvince.7 From seven MCCs in five provinces in 2005 this segment of the microfinance market \nhas grown rapidly to more than 3,600 MCCs in all provinces and municipalities by end-2011.8 \nMCCs  predominantly  focus  on  micro  lending,  targeting  local  farming  households,  sole \nproprietors, and entrepreneurs. \n4.  MCCs are the first group of private-sector-owned financial institutions in the PRC. They \nface many regulatory constraints\u2014on the limited geographic area of operation, business scope, \n                                                \n1 The new classification of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the PRC was made effective on 18 June \n2011 to be more comparable to international systems. Generally, classifications are based on the amount of \nrevenue, number of employees, or size of assets for different sectors. In the industry sector, a small enterprise \nshould have revenue of CNY3 million\u2013CNY20 million and 20\u2013300 employees; a micro enterprise should have less \nthan CNY3 million revenue or less than 20 employees. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Real gross domestic product growth for 2011 was 9.2% and inflation was 4.1%. Foreign direct investment reached \nan all time high of $115.86 billion in 2011. \n4  Sector Overview (accessible from linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  An inclusive financial system is one that services all clients, not just the relatively well off. This means servicing \npoor and low-income clients with a wide range of accessible products. \n6  This is due to unreliable financial reporting, lack of collateral and guarantees, lack of credit rating and general credit \ninformation, and loan officers responsibility for loan losses. \n7  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Rural Finance Reforms and Development \nof Microfinance Institutions. Manila (TA 4430\u2013PRC, $1 million). The technical assistance established MCCs as \npilots in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and in Guizhou Province; MCCs were subsequently replicated \nnationwide. \n8  According to PBC statistics on MCCs, at the end of August 2011 the whole sector had 3,687 MCCs, 39,353 \nemployees,  CNY273  billion  total  capital,  and  CNY319  billion  total  loans  outstanding.  The  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region had the most MCCs\u2014its top eight provinces accounted for more than 50% of all MCCs. ", "2   \nand funding sources\u2014as well as natural funding restrictions due to their status as non-deposit-\ntaking institutions. MCCs generally focus on areas they are familiar with and, despite restrictions \nand unfavorable tax treatment, their average profitability after tax is a 9% return on equity. The \ndevelopment of MCCs has brought healthy competition to the microfinance market. In addition \nto MCCs, there are also active institutions such as rural credit cooperatives, rural commercial \nbanks,  postal  saving  banks,  village  and  township  banks  (VTBs),  lending  subsidiaries  of \ncommercial banks, and farmer credit unions. Among these, VTBs are most comparable to \nMCCs; however, unlike MCCs they take deposits. The development of VTBs has been much \nslower than that of MCCs\u2014there were 440 VTBs as of June 2011. \n5.  The  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  is  responsible  for  supervising \ndeposit-taking  institutions,  but  not  MCCs.  The  key  document  providing  the  basis  for  the \nregulatory framework for MCCs is the Guide Regarding MCC Pilots, issued jointly by the PBC \nand CBRC in 2008,9 which serves as the basis for local regulations issued by provincial finance \noffices.10 Local finance offices actively exchange experiences and ideas, and better practices in \none province can be quickly adopted in others. MCC associations at provincial and national \nlevels also act as self-regulatory bodies. \nB.  Rationale \n6.  Despite rapid growth MCCs face several challenges, the most critical being the shortage \nof funding sources to reach economies of scale for commercial sustainability. When ADB and \nthe PBC worked on MCC pilots in 2004\u20132005, a decision was made to allow MCCs to borrow \nfrom no more than two wholesale lenders amounts up to 50% of their equity capital. By August \n2011, loan funds accounted for only about 10% of overall MCC funding sources. There has \nbeen some lending to MCCs from large state-owned banks such as the China Development \nBank, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. However, \nnone of these larger banks were able to sustain loans to MCCs due to limitations in the bank \nbranch networks and lack of efficient decision-making processes at the local level. \n7.  MCCs urgently need access to wholesale lending from banks. Most MCCs deploy their \nfunds in 2\u20133 months and recycle funds from repaid loans, as most loans are of short duration. \nThe development of the microfinance wholesale market has been slow, but there is scope to \nexpand. Local commercial banks are potentially strong wholesalers for MCCs, as they are \nlicensed for the local market and have better understanding of and access to MCCs. A well-\ndeveloped wholesale market can (i) strengthen the financial and operational capacity of MCCs \nto better serve rural and micro borrowers, (ii) provide a channel for local commercial banks to \nimprove their presence in the microfinance market through MCCs, and (iii) establish a market \nmechanism to increase transparency in the MCC sector for improved regulatory oversight. \n8.  ADB will work with local partner banks, as ADB\u2019s direct borrowers, to channel funds to \nMCCs and the microfinance market. The facility is expected to have a significant catalytic \nimpact  through  a  learning-by-doing  process,  helping  local  partner  banks  establish  MCC \n                                                \n9  Government of the PRC, CBRC, and PBC. 2008. Guide Regarding MCC Pilots. Beijing, (in Chinese.) The guide \nspecifies that MCCs are limited liability companies sponsored by corporations or natural persons, engaging in \nmicrolending. The guide prescribed the following: (i) general requirements for MCC establishment and dissolution; \n(ii) source, size, and use of capital; (iii) product and geographical restrictions; (iv) risk management parameters, \nsuch as single borrower limit; and (v) general regulatory norms such as accounting and reporting, interest rates, \ngeneral and special provisions, and access to the credit information bureau. \n10 The local government finance office is in charge of development of local financial markets. The China Finance \nOffice Joint Conference Center (http://www.govfn.com) serves as the coordinating mechanism for local government \nfinance offices nationwide. \n ", "  3 \nwholesale  lending  as  a  regular  line  of  business.  More  local  banks  will  be  encouraged  to \nparticipate in wholesale lending to MCCs once they see this as a profitable business with both \nfinancial and social impacts. A pre-established set of criteria will be applied in selecting partner \nbanks. The banks will undergo a thorough due diligence process and review to ensure prudent \ncredit and financial standing. Potential partner banks do not yet have experience in microfinance \nwholesale lending. However, they have participated in the World Bank\u2019s technical assistance \n(TA) for developing micro and small and medium-sized enterprise financing operations and \nhave competent micro and small and medium-sized enterprise financing teams. With these \nskills and further training, they can enter the MCC wholesale market segment reasonably easily. \n9.  ADB will contribute to capacity development of partner banks through ADB\u2019s TA for \nCapacity Development of Partner Banks in Microfinance Wholesale Lending11 that will provide \ntraining in establishing commercially sustainable MCC wholesale lending programs. Training will \ncover  business  strategies,  market  development  plans,  loan  underwriting  and  borrower \nevaluation techniques, risk management, loan portfolio management, collection, loan workout \nmethodologies,  and  delinquent  loan  resolution.  Safeguards  will  also  be  addressed  here  to \nensure  participating  bank  systems  meet  ADB  requirements.  Training  materials  will  be \ndisseminated to other local banks to encourage further wholesale lending to MCCs. \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n10.  One of the key strategic directions of the country partnership strategy (2008\u20132010) for \nthe PRC was inclusive growth and balanced development, focusing operations on poorer inland \nprovinces and promoting integrated rural and urban development.12 The country partnership \nstrategy (2011\u20132015) currently in preparation continues to recognize inclusive growth as one of \nthe three pillars to foster balanced and equitable development. Strengthening access to finance \nthrough the microfinance sector will have a strong impact on poverty alleviation. Finance sector \ndevelopment is listed as one of the five core areas of ADB\u2019s development agenda under \nStrategy 2020.13 The Financial Sector Operational Plan identifies financial inclusion as one of \nthe two pillars.14 ADB\u2019s Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy15 calls for \ntapping the increasing potential of the poor by expanding access to microfinance. By increasing \nresources to MCCs and their borrowers, there will be greater participation of the private sector \nin  economic  growth,  creating  more  employment  opportunities  and  increased  income. \nAdditionally,  access  to  microcredit  and  other  financial  services  helps  the  poor  to  improve \nincomes and withstand economic shocks. \n11.  ADB has continuously supported the rural and microfinance sectors in the PRC. In \naddition  to  its  groundbreaking  work  in  2004  to  develop  privately  owned  commercially \nsustainable MFIs, ADB is now partnering with (i) the PBC to support innovations in rural and \nmicrofinance and improve rural finance statistics, (ii) the CBRC to strengthen the rural finance \nregulatory framework, and (iii) credit rating companies to develop credit and social performance \nratings  for  MCCs.16  This  facility  shares  synergies  with  the  microfinance  risk  participation \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

Development Impact \n12.  Impact. The impact of the facility will be improved access to finance for entrepreneurs, \nMSEs, and poor households in the central and western regions of the PRC, thus contributing to \neconomic and private sector growth and poverty reduction. \n13.  Outcome. The outcome will be successful establishment of the MCC wholesale lending \nmarket. With ADB\u2019s participation, partner banks will be developing a new niche product. \n14.  Outputs. The facility outputs will include the following: (i) development of selective \npartner banks\u2019 wholesale lending capacity to MCCs, including establishing prudent business \nprocesses  and  safeguards  to  ensure  both  financial  and  social  performance  of  MCCs;  (ii) \nstrengthened financial and institutional capabilities of MCCs, including enhanced gender equity \naspects;  and  (iii)  effective  regulatory  oversight  for  the  MCC  market  through  strengthened \nrelationships among MCCs, local banks, and local government regulators. \n15.  Gender. Globally, microfinance has been an effective tool for addressing some issues of \ngender inequality. Of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty, 70% are women. Women make up \n40%\u201370% of the informal sector, and they often enter the labor force through micro enterprises, \nyet they are usually excluded from access to finance.18 In the PRC, microfinance has shown a \npositive impact on women, providing increased participation in decision making, improved status \nin  the  household  and  in  communities,  and  enhanced  skills  in  and  knowledge  of  financial \nservices.19 Women also play an important role in MCC development. For example, in Jiangsu \nProvince more than half of the MCCs are owned by women, and in most MCCs more than half \nof the staff and clients are women. \n16.  The facility will further promote women\u2019s participation in MCCs. Female targets of 30% \nof staff to be trained in the partner banks and 30% of MCC clients as borrowers under the \nfacility will encourage stronger engagement. Depending on market demand, there will also be \nfinancial literacy training, supported by partner banks, targeting up to 50% women. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  The ADB assistance in aggregate not exceeding CNY130 million will be made available \nto  selected  partner  banks20  for  onlending  to  MCCs  in  the  PRC.  The  facility  will  provide \nnonsovereign unsecured loans to selected partner banks of not more than CNY40 million per \nbank. The facility will have a 4-year availability period, subject to ADB\u2019s satisfaction with the \nfacility\u2019s performance, two years after the first credit agreement is signed with a partner bank. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nChina for Rural Finance Innovation and Rural and Agriculture Financial Statistical System Development.

Principal repaid within the availability period may be reborrowed.21 \n18.  Loans made to partner banks through this facility will have tenors of up to 3 years with \namortization starting 1 year after the first disbursement. Loan amounts made available to each \npartner bank will be determined based on repayment ability and capacity to develop an MCC \nwholesale lending business. Loan interest will be based on the 3-month Shanghai interbank \noffered rate or other appropriate benchmark plus an appropriate spread. \n19.  MCCs will be initially screened by partner banks and assessed against ADB's eligibility \ncriteria for the facility. Partner banks will conduct due diligence in accordance with  ADB's \nrequirements and in line with ADB policies on anticorruption, safeguards, gender, integrity, and \nprocurement. ADB will conduct due diligence on potential partner banks and submit reports to \nthe Investment Committee for approval. Appropriate facility limits and other sublimits for partner \nbanks and MCCs will be maintained, unless otherwise approved by the Investment Committee. \n20.  Partner bank eligibility for ADB financing and selection process. The facility will be \nopen to banks that meet the eligibility criteria and are approved by the Investment Committee. A \nfinal set of eligibility criteria will be determined based on the results of due diligence and term \nnegotiations with potential partner banks. Eligibility criteria will include the following: \n(i)  using the proceeds solely for wholesale lending to MCCs, and providing funding \nequal to ADB\u2019s contribution wholesale lending; \n(ii)  having a sound ownership and management structure and a business plan for \nthe microfinance sector, and working with recognized auditors; \n(iii)  having worked, or working satisfactorily, to develop credit standards and internal \nrisk rating systems that pass detailed ADB due diligence and the Investment \nCommittee process; \n(iv)  having a dedicated team handling MCC relationships and risk management, and \nhave  in  place,  or  be  developing,  an  acceptable  underwriting  and  servicing \nplatform; \n(v)  ensuring that lending does not cause adverse environmental or social impacts; \n(vi)  exhibiting financial soundness22 as evidenced by adequate capital, asset quality, \nliquidity, and profitability, including (a) maintaining the capital adequacy ratio and \nother regulatory requirements prescribed by the banking regulator, (b) a ratio of \nnonperforming assets of less than 5%, (c) a current ratio higher than 20%, and \n(d) no default history on own obligations; \n(vii)  having a credit rating of BB\u2013 and above or equivalent, or an NSO8 (employing \nADB's internal ratings system); \n(viii)  committing  to  establish  an  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS) to ensure due diligence and mitigation of adequate impacts in all stages \nof  facility  operation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009), and adopting the agreed selection criteria set out in the environmental \nand social assessment and review framework and committed to engage qualified \nstaff or train staff to implement ESMS; and \n(ix)  not having previously borrowed from the facility. \n                                                \n21 Implementation Arrangements\u2014Chart of Project Flow of Funds (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n22 At the minimum, all partner banks will need to meet all regulatory ratio requirements set by the CBRC for capital \nadequacy, nonperforming loans liquidity,  overall bank liquidity, and operations. ", "6   \n21.  Additional criteria may be included in the loan documents for any or all partner banks. To \nparticipate in the facility, partner banks must participate in the small-scale capacity development \nTA. In allocating funds from the facility, ADB will review up to five partner banks, and no single \nbank will receive more than CNY40 million. Risk will be spread across multiple partner banks. \n22.  Partner banks will be selected according to the following assessment process: \n(i)  Identify candidate partner banks. ADB will identify candidate partner banks \nthrough market research, referrals from respected microfinance equity investors, \nand referrals from ADB\u2019s peer institutions. To merit consideration, partner banks \nmust meet the selection criteria described in para. 20. \n(ii)  Due diligence. ADB will conduct due diligence on each of the candidate partner \nbanks under consideration. Due diligence will be a standard assessment of the \ncandidate as a financial institution, with a focus on (a) the overall strength of the \ninstitution; (b) its capacity to deploy an ADB loan for wholesale lending to MCCs, \nand continue to engage in the wholesale market thereafter; and (c) its capacity to \nrepay the loan to ADB. \n(iii)  Project proposal. Based on the due diligence results, ADB will decide whether \nto  proceed  with  processing  a  loan  to  any  candidate  partner  bank  and  will \ndetermine the terms of the proposed loan. This determination will be in keeping \nwith market funding costs and will explore loan structures as appropriate. \n23.  Subject to approval and agreement on the terms, ADB will sign documentation with the \npartner bank and the loan will be disbursed through ADB\u2019s standard systems. \n24.  Microcredit companies\u2019 eligibility to use funds. Funds borrowed by partner banks \nfrom the facility can only be used for wholesale lending to eligible MCCs.

Microcredit companies\u2019 lending parameters. Subject to negotiations with the partner \nbanks, MCCs that borrow facility funds from partner banks may be required to make loans with \nthose funds, after satisfying the following criteria: \n(i)  all proceeds of the facility borrowed from partner banks must be onlent to micro \nentrepreneurs and MSEs as defined by the government in June 2011;24 \n                                                \n23 The Dagong Global Credit Rating Company has developed a methodology for MCC credit rating. ADB will work \nwith the company and international partners to implement credit and social performance rating systems for MCCs. \n24 Classifications of Micro and Small Enterprises (accessible from linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7 \n(ii)  the average loan size in each MCC portfolio funded by the facility is not to \nexceed CNY200,000 and the maximum is not to exceed CNY1 million or single \nborrower limited, whichever is lower;25 \n(iii)  no loan will finance activities listed in ADB's prohibited investment activity list; \n(iv)  loans must comply with applicable national and local laws and regulations; \n(v)  to  facilitate  financial  inclusiveness  for  women,  MCCs  will  ensure  women \nborrowers sign or co-sign at least 30% of loans; \n(vi)  loan maturity dates to final borrowers must not occur later than the maturity date \nof loans from the partner banks; \n(vii)  at least 50% of the loans to MSEs should have tenors of less than 1 year; and \n(viii)  borrowers must be selected using subborrower selection and exclusion criteria \nset out in the ESMS established by partner banks for MCCs. \n26.  Confirmation  of  eligibility  of  microcredit  companies.  Partner  banks  will  be \nresponsible  for  selecting  MCCs  according  to  the  agreed  upon  eligibility  criteria  and  for \nsubmitting reports to ADB for no-objection. \n(i)  Submission of candidate MCCs by the partner bank. The partner banks will \nsubmit  a  list  of  MCCs  to  ADB  for  no-objection,  using  a  pre-agreed  format, \ntogether with the financial, operational, and market information required to enable \nADB to conduct reviews. 26 \n(ii)  Evaluation and confirmation. ADB will conduct a review of MCCs against the \nestablished  eligibility  criteria.  The  no-objection  will  be  summarized  in  a  pre-\nagreed format to be communicated to the partner banks. \n27.  Reporting requirements. Efficient and effective reporting arrangements from partner \nbanks to ADB and from MCCs to partner banks are essential to ensure successful operation of \nthe facility. These will include the following: \n(i)  from partner banks to ADB: annual reports in English for evaluation of MCCs, \nannual reports of MCC wholesale lending portfolio performance, implementation \nstatus of ESMS both at MCC level and at the partner bank level, and audited \nannual financial statements; and \n(ii)  from MCCs to partner banks: semiannual summary table of subloans, selected \nsubloan files and completed ESMS checklists and status for subloans, portfolio \nperformance information,  and annual financial statements. \nB.  Investment Cost and Financing Plan \n28.  The financing plan for each partner bank will depend on the results of the detailed due \ndiligence of that bank and final negotiation. In terms of market demand, using the five provinces \nthat the ADB project team visited as an example, there are more than 850 MCCs with total \nregistered capital estimated at CNY45.4 billion. These equity levels would give them room to \nborrow up to CNY22.7 billion. Assuming that about 25% of these MCCs are eligible to borrow, \nwith partner banks contributing 50% and the facility only providing 5% of borrowing needs, \nADB\u2019s  total  contribution  will  be  CNY130  million  and  partner  banks  will  contribute  another \nCNY130 million for a total of CNY260 million lent to MCCs. \n                                                \n25 A loan is generally considered as micro credit if it is less than CNY50,000; the CBRC allows it to be less than \nCNY300,000. The single borrower limit is set at 5% of net capital by most local governments. \n26 ADB will conduct a detailed review of the first batch of MCCs submitted by each partner bank to ensure that each \nbank has adequate capability in selecting and evaluation of MCCs.

Justification for ADB Assistance \n29.  MCCs are constrained in their ability to meet the demand for financial services to MSEs \nand the poor due to lack of capital. Commercial banks have been reluctant to lend to MCCs due \nto their unfamiliarity with the microfinance market and lack of technical skills to evaluate loans to \nMCCs. ADB intervention and capacity building support in working with commercial banks for \nwholesale lending to MCCs will encourage banks to engage with MCCs, familiarize themselves \nwith the market, and develop efficient systems and procedures. Additionally, since the partner \nbanks will take the MCC credit risk, they will have strong incentives to develop prudent and \neffective  risk  underwriting  and  an  appropriate  risk  management  framework.  Availability  of \nwholesale funding will enhance sustainability of MCCs and result in reduced cost for micro \nborrowers. The facility will be fully dedicated to supporting and developing the MCC sector in \nthe PRC. The targeted nature of this intervention will have significant development impact in \npoor and underserved regions. \nD.  Risk and Mitigation Measures \n30.  Risks embedded in the transaction will include various credit, market, regulatory, and \noperational risks of partner banks: \n(i)  Bank  performance  risk.  The  ability  of  partner  banks  to  maintain  acceptable \nfinancial  performance  levels  may  be  affected  by  changes  in  risk  appetite, \nmaintenance  of  credit  underwriting  and  monitoring  procedures,  asset  quality, \nliquidity  conditions  and  regulatory  environment,  all  of  which  must  be  carefully \nassessed.  The  main  sources  of  systemic  risk  are:  the  impact  of  rapid  credit \nexpansion on credit quality, growing off-balance sheet exposures, reversals of \nrapidly rising real estate prices, and unbalanced economic growth patterns27. ADB \nwill  review  the  financial  strength  of  each  partner  bank  and  a  minimum  rating \nthreshold based on ADB\u2019s internal rating assessment of LCY ORR of NSO 8 (BB-) \nor better will be required for participation in the program.28  \n(ii)  Regulatory  risk. The changing regulatory landscape poses a risk to effective \nutilization of the facility especially because microfinance in the PRC is in a nascent \nphase and the sector lacks customized policies and laws. The MCC sector is \nsupervised  by  local government  entities  and provincial  financial market  offices \nwhich may have varying experience with these entities, therefore each partner \nbank application must include an assessment of the local regulatory framework. \nAdditionally, regulators in PRC exert influence over credit policies of the banks \nwhich  could  impact  the  MWLF  program.  This  may  be  partially  addressed  by \ncontinuing the close work with the CBRC on methods of increasing access to funds \nin  rural  areas,  and  requesting  banks to  seek written  approval from  regulators \nbefore proceeding to develop MCC wholesale financing.   \n                                                \n27 PRC: Financial System Stability Report, International Monetary Fund (2011). \n28\nAdditional credit enhancements such as guarantees of repayment obligations of partner banks by third-party \nguarantee companies will be considered by ADB, as appropriate. \n ", "  9 \n(iii)  Limited capacity for MCC lending. Commercial banks have no experience in \nMCC wholesale lending and consequently, have no established underwriting and \nrisk management processes tailored to this segment. This shortcoming is expected \nto be addressed through participation in ADB\u2019s technical assistance, which is a \nrequirement for each partner bank. \n(iv)  Replacement risk. ADB\u2019s program in terms of size is limited compared to the \noverall needs of the market. However, the impact is expected to extend beyond the \nprogram in mainstreaming the MCC wholesale lending market. The risk is that the \npartner banks will not maintain the wholesale lending business with their own \ncapital and will terminate the program upon repayment of the ADB loan. Mitigation \ninvolves close work with the banks to ensure commercial success for wholesaling \nto MCCs. \n(v)  MCC and microlending risks. As a new type of microfinance institution which \npreviously has not enjoyed stable funding sources, there is limited information on \nMCC  performance  and  repayment  history.  MCCs  extend  loans  to  micro \nentrepreneurs and MSEs, most of whom have low income, few pledgeable assets, \nand little or no credit history. Operational costs are higher due to the large volume \nof  transactions  in  smaller  amounts.  MCCs  are  located  in  communities  and \npotentially have better knowledge of their borrowers than larger banks, and report \nlow rates of loan impairment so far.29 \n(vi)  Audit and reporting standards. Loan review missions will closely monitor the \nquality of audit and reporting of partner banks and the MCCs, which in some cases \nmay be less than is needed to reveal true financial and operational information. \nInternational auditing standards are not consistently practiced by city commercial \nbanks in the PRC. Partner banks must work with recognized auditors and commit \nto disclosures and reporting. Partner banks are also required to submit annual \nfinancial statements in English. \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n31.  The facility is classified FI, treated as C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.30 The facility will only support \nMSE lending with minimal or no adverse environmental impacts, and which is unlikely to have \nimpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The partner banks and MCCs will \n(i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) exclude all projects that will have adverse \nenvironmental and social safeguards impacts, (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds \nabide by applicable national laws and regulations, and (iv) comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement.  The  ESMS  will  comprise  screening  procedures  and  reporting  arrangements  to \npartner banks and arrangements to comply with national labor laws and ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy31 to ensure adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards, including \nprovisions prohibiting any discrimination against women in hiring and providing equal pay for \nequal work for men and women. Partner banks will review ESMS developed by MCCs , monitor \nthe performance of these ESMSs, and submit consolidated reports to ADB annually and on \nproject completion. MCCs will screen MSE applicants using a screening checklist, and report to \nthe  partner  bank  on  ESMS  performance  on  an  annual  basis.  ADB  has  prepared  the \nenvironmental and social assessment and review framework to ensure that relevant PRC and \n                                                \n29 Currently, MCC loan loss ratios are very low (less than 1% in those reviewed in the field). \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 ADB. 2001.

", "10  \nSafeguard Policy Statement environmental and social safeguards are included in the MCC \nselection and/or exclusion criteria of the recipients of microfinance lending.32 Based on this \nframework, each partner bank as well as each MCC will develop and establish an ESMS to \nensure  due  diligence  and  adequate  impact  mitigation  in  all  stages  of  facility  operation  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement before the first disbursement of funds. The \nESMSs prepared by partner banks will be documented and agreed upon with ADB prior to loan \neffectiveness. \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n32.   Partner  banks  will  be  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \nC.  Investment Limitations \n33.  The proposed loan lies within the country, industry, group, and medium-term and single \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \nD.  Assurances \n34.  No objection. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank \n(the Charter),33 the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China will be requested to confirm \nthat  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  financing.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance  by  its  Board  of  Directors  and  selection  and  approval  of  partner  banks  by  the \nInvestment Committee. \n35.  Documentation. ADB will enter into suitable loan agreements and other required legal \ndocuments  with  partner  banks  once  the  individual  loan  terms  are  approved  by  ADB\u2019s \nInvestment Committee. The agreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.34 \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.   I am satisfied that the proposed facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \nCNY130,000,000 for the Microfinance Wholesale Lending Facility in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n6 March 2012 \n                                                \n32 Environmental and Social Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 1966.
