As  part  of  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  2005\u20132007,1  technical \nassistance (TA) for the second phase of improving financial sector governance in Kazakhstan \nwas included in the nonlending pipeline for 2005. The TA is part of an envisaged series of three \nfinancial  sector  governance  TAs  over  2004\u20132006.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) visited Almaty and Astana during 18-22 July 2005 and met with the \nAgency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation and Supervision of Financial Markets and \nFinancial Organizations (FSAK); National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK); Ministry of Economy, \nBudget, and Planning; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Labor and Social Protection; financial \ninstitutions; and bilateral/multilateral organizations. The Government and the Mission reached \nan  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Kazakhstan\u2019s financial sector has grown rapidly and, in recent years, has been the fastest-\ngrowing sector outside the oil industry. This development has occurred against the backdrop of \nfavorable macroeconomic prospects, an ambitious program of structural reforms, and a cautious \nfiscal stance supported by increasing oil revenues. The financial sector remains bank-dominated, \nwith banking system assets accounting for almost 50% of gross domestic product (GDP); and the \nrest (insurance companies, pension funds, equities, and nonbanks), for only about 14% of GDP. \n \n3.  Financial supervision is the responsibility of FSAK, an independent agency which was \nspun off from NBK in January 2004. FSAK is accountable to the President of the Republic and \nhas clear responsibilities and objectives. It has a detailed cooperation agreement with NBK and \nobtains  its funding  from  the  latter.  The  2004  update  of the  joint  Financial  Sector  Stability \nAssessment by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank3 concluded that a suitable \nlegal  framework  exists  for  banking  supervision,  and  that  compliance  with  the  Basle  Core \nPrinciples has substantially improved since 2000, with respect to not only the legal foundations \nbut  also  practical  application.  However,  because  FSAK  and  the  legal  framework  were \nestablished only recently, it would be critical to focus on implementation in key areas, including \ncompleting the launch phase of FSAK (e.g., adequate staffing and training), achieving effective \nconsolidated  supervision,  and  implementing  risk  management  requirements  introduced  in \nDecember 2003. \n \n4.  The banking sector has seen the following recent developments: \n \n(i)  Overall bank loan growth has been rapid and credit risk has grown. Loans grew \nby 42% in 2004, with the share of \u201cclassified\u201d loans (doubtful and bad) rising from \n39% in 2003 to 44%,  and loan losses rising from 2% of total loans in 2003 to 3% \nin 2004. Although the banking system\u2019s capital adequacy ratio currently seems \ncomfortable (about 16% at end-2004), the rapid credit expansion and the rise in \nthe share of \u201cclassified\u201d loans (despite strong real growth) call for closer attention \nto credit evaluation and risk management capacities and practices in banks. \n \n(ii)  Household deposits have not grown as fast as credit. Hence, banks have tended \nto rely on wholesale funding (e.g., syndicated loans, Eurobonds, or medium-term \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): Kazakhstan. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 13 August 2005. \n3 IMF. 2004. Republic of Kazakhstan\u2013Financial System Stability Assessment\u2013Update. Washington DC. \n ", "2   \nnotes).  Consequently,  net  external  liabilities  have  risen  sharply  since  2000. \nMoreover,  the  share  of  foreign currency  lending  in  total bank  credit,  though \ndeclining, remains high at more than 50% of total credit. The situation raises \nconcerns about banks\u2019 capacity to manage the foreign exchange and interest \nrate risks associated with reliance on foreign borrowing.  \n \n(iii)  Concentration in certain sectors (e.g., real estate and consumer lending) and large \nbusiness groups remains an issue. Real estate lending jumped from 15% of total \nloans  in  2003  to  19%  in  2004.  Also,  the  emergence  of  interlinked  financial-\nindustrial groups raises the need for strengthening the supervision of related party \nlending, aggregated large exposures, and bank\u2019s risk management practices. \n \n(iv)  In general, the quality of financial and risk management varies greatly among the \nbanks, with smaller banks facing serious challenges in maintaining their viability. \n \n5.  As  previously  noted,  legislation  and  regulations  on  risk  management  in  banks  and \nconsolidated supervision were issued in 2004 and provide a framework for addressing the \nabove concerns. However, for this recently established framework to sufficiently contribute to \npromoting financial stability, the capacity of on-site inspectors to ensure that banks rigorously \napply the regulations needs to be bolstered. \n \n6.  Meanwhile, the key to fostering the growth of the nonbank sector is to strengthen its \nlargest  component,  the  pension  system.  Since  the  establishment  in  1998  of  the  defined \ncontribution pension system modeled after Chile\u2019s, the Kazakhstani private pension system has \ngrown steadily. Employees are required to contribute 10% of their salaries to an accumulation \npension fund (APF) of their choice; these funds then delegate the investment to at least one asset \nmanagement company (AMC). The invested funds are guaranteed to grow by at least the rate of \ninflation until the contributor retires. In addition, all citizens, including those receiving disability \nallowances, receive a base pension irrespective of their pension contributions. As of mid-2005, \ntotal assets amounted to about $4.4 billion (10% of GDP). There are about 7 million accounts \nadministered by 15 APFs, of which the largest is the Halyk Bank Accumulation Pension Fund, \nwith 25% of total assets. Coverage is not universal, with most of the rural population and the self-\nemployed not participating; participation in the voluntary (i.e., supplementary) contribution system \nis also minimal. \n \n7.  The  funds\u2019  investment  opportunities  are  limited  by  the  lack  of  domestic  financial \ninstruments. Consequently, at end-2004, about 54% of their assets were held as government \nsecurities (including NBK notes), well above the 25% minimum required holding. Conversely, \nother  holdings  are  well  below  the  regulatory  ceilings;  for  example,  foreign  government \nsecurities, 0.1% (vs 40%), and Kazakhstani non-state securities, 32% (vs 50%). In turn, the lack \nof financial instruments is due to the relative underdevelopment of the Kazakhstani financial \nsector, despite its recent rapid growth. Although, theoretically, diversification into foreign assets \ncould help alleviate this problem, this is not feasible in practice due to the lack of hedging \ninstruments. The funds have recently been allowed to engage in trading derivatives, but this is \nnot likely to help the situation because (i) the regulations still need to be clarified (e.g., the \ndistinction between speculation and hedging); and (ii) derivatives instruments do not exist. In \nfact,  the  lack  of  hedging  instruments  contributed  to  the  negative  returns  that  the  system \n ", "  3\nexperienced in the past 2 years, due to losses from dollar-denominated securities as the tenge \nappreciated.4  \n \n8.  The  limited  capacity  of  APFs  and  AMCs,  combined  with  their  significant  fiduciary \nresponsibilities, implies that closer attention to their regulation is also warranted. FSAK has set \nregulations on investment portfolio, accounting rules, disclosure and announcement requirements, \nperformance  evaluation  systems,  and  additional  capital  contribution  requirements  for \nunderperforming APFs. However, there are concerns about whether these regulations provide \nadequate incentives for APFs to improve their financial viability and long-term sustainability. As \nwith banks, the risk management practices of APFs and AMCs require close scrutiny. \n \n9.  To  assist  FSAK  in  addressing  these  concerns,  the  TA  will  focus  on  two  areas: \n(i) strengthening on-site banking supervision, and (ii) strengthening the regulation of APFs and \nAMCs. The TA will build on FSAK\u2019s achievements in establishing a sound legislative framework \nfor financial supervision, as well as support the Government\u2019s plans to promote Almaty as a \nregional financial center. The TA will complement, but will be different from TA 4431-KAZ5 and \nTA 6137-REG.6 The former deals with improving NBK\u2019s asset management and establishing an \ninflation  targeting  framework,  and  was  formulated  when  FSAK  had  not  yet  been  fully \nestablished. The latter focused on reviewing existing risk management regulations in several \ncountries, rather than on implementation aspects. A sequence of measures is envisaged to \npromote financial sector development: TA 4431-KAZ will help promote a sound macroeconomic \nenvironment, TA 6137-REG will provide the initial inputs for a risk management framework, and \nthe present TA will assist the newly established FSAK in implementing the already well-defined \nregulatory framework, with focus on the banking sector, as it remains the dominant player in the \nfinancial sector. The third financial sector TA planned for 2007 would then focus on developing \nthe nonbank sector. \n \n10.  The TA will also complement assistance currently being provided by other sources. First, \nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), through due diligence of its \nparticipant banks and moral suasion, has helped these entities improve their risk management \ncapacity;  these  efforts  would  dovetail  well  with  strengthening  the  supervisory  side  of  risk \nmanagement.  Second,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\u2019s  Financial \nSector Initiative, which will be completed in late 2005,  has (i) provided software to help FSAK \nmonitor APFs\u2019 and AMCs\u2019 performance and asset allocations; (ii) provided assistance in drafting \nregulations on consolidated supervision (but not the implementation aspect); (iii) performed \nanalytical studies of the finances and projections of the State Accumulation Pension Fund; \n(iv) provided  training  for  actuaries,  which  can  become  the  foundation  for  future  training  of \npension specialists; and (v) provided expert legal advice on the securitization law and the \ncreation of infrastructure bonds as potential investment vehicles for AMCs. \n                                                 \n4 The lack of financial instruments is ultimately a matter for financial development policy. Due to the projected high oil \nrevenues and cautious fiscal stance, the stock of Government securities cannot be expected to increase, although \nthere have been recent issues of long-term inflation-indexed Government securities specially marketed to pension \nfunds, and there are plans to issue bonds linked to infrastructure projects. Corporate securities could also fill the \ngap, but fostering the non-state securities market will require an adequate financial infrastructure, including \neffective regulation of nonbank financial institutions, good corporate governance, a favorable atmosphere for \nenterprise listings of equities and bonds, and a sound framework for credit rating and evaluation. In this regard, the \nGovernment has established an interministerial working group to study measures to foster financial development, \nincluding efforts to promote Almaty as a regional financial center. \n5  ADB.  2004.

Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The overall objective of the TA is to foster a sound, efficient, and broad financial system by \nstrengthening the supervision of banks, APFs, and AMCs. The outputs of the TA will include \n(i) on-site inspection manuals for evaluating risk management systems and practices of banks, \nAPFs,  and  AMCs;  (ii)  a  training  program  for  on-site  banking  inspectors  of  FSAK;  (iii)  draft \nregulations and legislation to improve the effectiveness of on-site banking supervision; (iv) draft \nregulations and legislation to improve the framework for regulating operating practices, investment \nallocation, risk management, capital requirements, disclosure and announcement requirements, \naccounting, and derivatives activities of APFs and AMCs; and (v) recommendations on methods \nof calculating minimum required returns on pension funds\u2019 assets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will undertake the following activities under the two main components: \n \n(i)  Upgrading FSAK\u2019s capacity for on-site banking supervision \n \n(a)  Review  the  existing  framework  for  on-site  supervision  of  banks  and \nbanking  groups,  with  specific  focus  on  the  evaluation  of  banks\u2019  risk \nmanagement systems. \n(b)  Develop  and  upgrade  the  on-site  banking  supervision  framework, \nincluding risk management regulations, supervisory rating system, on-site \ninspection  manuals,  supervisory  information  system,  follow-up \nmechanisms after inspections, inspection strategies, and corrective action \nprogram. \n(c)  Strengthen supervision of banking groups on a consolidated basis. \n(d)  Draft new or amended regulations, guidelines, and manuals to implement \nthe recommendations in (b) and (c). \n \n(ii)  Strengthening the regulation of APFs and AMCs \n \n(a)  Review existing regulations on risk management, investment allocation, \nperformance evaluation and capital contribution requirements, disclosure \nand  announcement  requirements,  accounting  rules,  and  derivatives \nactivities. \n(b)  Given (a), draft new or amended regulations to ensure financial viability, \nlong-term sustainability, and competition in the pension system. \n(c)  Recommend  measures  to  improve  the  tracking  and  monitoring  of \nindividual pension accounts. \n(d)   Recommend  methods  of  calculating  minimum  required  returns  on \npension assets. \n(e)  Design and implement training programs for the management and key \nstaffs of FSAK, APFs, and AMCs; and on-site inspectors of FSAK. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $830,000 equivalent, of which $470,000 is in foreign \nexchange and $360,000 equivalent is in local currency.  The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $30,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan.  The Government of Kazakhstan will finance the balance of \nthe local currency cost, equivalent to $330,000, through the provision of counterpart staff, office \nspace and workshop facilities, remuneration and per-diem of domestic consultants, equipment, and \ncontingencies. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  FSAK will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It is expected to provide the necessary \noffice  space,  counterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  other  services  for  the  consultants;  and \narrange  their  appointments  with  relevant  organizations.  FSAK  will  coordinate  with  other \ngovernment agencies and financial institutions to provide the consultants with necessary data \nand  information  and  support  them  in  arranging  workshops  and  training  programs  for  the \nregulators and financial institutions. \n \n15.  The TA will require 30 person-months of consulting services: 12 from two international \nconsultants, and 18 from three domestic. The international consultants will be an on-site banking \nsupervision specialist/team leader and a pension fund regulatory specialist. Domestic consultants \nwill  include  a  banking  regulatory  specialist,  a  pension  fund  specialist,  and  an  information \ntechnology specialist. Appendix 3 outlines the terms of reference. Consultants will be recruited \nindividually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n16.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 3 weeks after beginning their \nservices, (ii) two interim reports 3 and 5 months after the start of their services, (iii) draft final \nreports before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports after incorporating FSAK\u2019s \nand ADB's comments. All reports must be submitted in both English and Russian. The TA will \nbegin in January 2006 and will be completed in December 2006. A dissemination workshop will \nbe organized near the end of the implementation period to invite comments from international \nand domestic experts, and disseminate the project findings. The TA will also support training \nprograms for the management and staffs of FSAK, banks, APFs, and AMCs on, among other \nthings, on-site inspections, risk management, and investment policies of APFs and AMCs. \nConsultants  will  arrange  the  dissemination  workshop  and  training  programs  in  close \ncoordination with FSAK and in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Kazakhstan for Financial Sector Governance Phase II, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \n \nImpact       \nSound financial system  Broad money  Economic reports and  Assumptions \nwith increased  increases from 29% of  official statistics from FSAK,  \u2022  Macroeconomic and \nefficiency and outreach  GDP in 2004 to 32%  National Bank of  political stability \n  by 2007  Kazakhstan (NBK),  \u2022  Continuing Government \n  International Monetary  commitment to structural \nCredit to the economy  Fund (IMF), and World  reforms \nincreases from 30% of  Bank   \nGDP in 2004 to 32%    Risks \nby 2007  Asian Development Bank  \u2022  Large negative external \n  (ADB) review missions  shock to the economy \nStrengthened    \u2022  Weakened political \nregulation and  commitment to structural \nsupervision of banks,  reforms \naccumulation pension   \nfunds (APFs), and \nasset management \ncompanies (AMCs) \n \nStronger institutional \ncapacity of the Agency \nof the Republic of \nKazakhstan on \nRegulation and \nSupervision of \nFinancial Markets and \nFinancial \nOrganizations (FSAK) \n \nOutcome       \nImproved supervision of  Decrease in classified  Economic reports and  Assumptions \nbanks (in the areas of  loan ratio of the  official statistics from FSAK,  \u2022  Continuing Government \nrisk management and  banking system (from  NBK, IMF, and World Bank  commitment to promote \nconsolidated  44% of the loan    financial stability \nsupervision) and APFs,  portfolio in 2004 to  ADB review missions  \u2022  FSAK maintains \nand AMCs (in the areas  30% by 2007)    operational independence \nof portfolio allocation,    and support of the \naccounting, disclosure  Exposure to foreign  Government \nand announcement  exchange risk and   \npractices, performance  market risk in banks  Risk  \nevaluation, and  properly measured  \u2022  Strong economic growth \nadditional capital  and controlled  leading to complacency \nadequacy, etc.)    and neglect of proper risk \n  management by banks, \n  APFs, and AMCs  \n   \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \n \nOutputs       \n1.
