INTRODUCTION\n1. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will establish a monitoring platform \nto assess in near-real time the economic impacts of disasters, and to trace social, environmental, \nand  other  indicators.  Under  this  TA,  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment (ERCD), in collaboration with leading experts and data centers, will carry out research \nand impact assessments. ERCD will share methods and outputs in support of interested Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) regional members, and widely circulate technical papers, policy notes, \nresearch articles, and other knowledge products.\n2. The TA aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability), and with \noperational priority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity), by improving the \ncapacity  of  the  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  assess  disaster  impacts  and \nsocioeconomic performance, for example, by using satellite imagery or other digital technology \nfor impact-based forecasting.1 The TA also helps implement operational priority 2: accelerating \nprogress in gender equality.2 It aligns with the principles adopted at the 2019 G20 Meeting in \nOsaka, Japan, especially promoting resilience against disasters triggered by natural hazards and \nincreasing support for actions and cooperation in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction.3 \nThe proposed TA is in ERCD\u2019s annual work program.4\nII. ISSUES\n3. Analysts and policy makers who want to assess the socioeconomic impacts of disasters,\neconomic crises, and other extreme events, typically lack access to timely, current information.\nFor example, the dearth of current data on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic during\nthe first weeks and months after its appearance\u2014other than the recorded numbers of clinically\nconfirmed cases and fatalities\u2014limited the ability to assess the pandemic\u2019s impact. This increased\nuncertainty and the outbreak\u2019s socioeconomic costs stunted the effectiveness of early policy\nresponses. The same is true of the lack of timely data on other disasters triggered by natural\nhazards, such as floods, droughts, and earthquakes, whose impacts are usually not assessed\nuntil long after the event, or remain entirely unknown. In normal times, ADB\u2019s DMCs often have\nlimited capacity to monitor current economic activity because of underlying root problems (i)\ndelayed or unavailable impact measures and macroeconomic and social indicators; (ii) impaired\naccess to relevant sources of contemporaneous information about impacts, including satellite\nimagery and big data; and (iii) limited ability to adequately process and combine available sources\nand modeling techniques. Combined, these three problems exacerbate the core problem of\ninsufficient  current  data,  which  limits  DMCs\u2019  capacity  to  assess  disaster  impacts  and\nsocioeconomic performance in real time.\n4. ADB has actively explored \u201cnowcasting\u201d solutions that facilitate timely policy interventions,\nespecially for countries where gross domestic product and other core economic indicators\n1 ADB. 2018.

", "2 \nbecome available only on a yearly basis. For example, ERCD\u2019s TA for Data for Development \n(Phase 2) aims to strengthen DMCs\u2019 national statistics offices capacity to produce official statistics \nwith the use of innovative data sources; the TA for Deepening Understanding of Macroeconomic \nFluctuations in DMCs for Improved Economic Assessment uses nowcasting tools to analyze \nbusiness cycles and potential risks; and the TA for Supporting Knowledge Solutions in Central \nand West Asian Countries seeks to improve near-term forecasting in Central and West Asia \nDepartment countries, in collaboration with ERCD.5  While ERCD applied previous and ongoing \nefforts to a few select countries only, they constitute a valuable basis for this TA to build on. The \nTA team will achieve such broader application by establishing a systematic data collection and \nmonitoring platform to enable nowcasting during normal times and impact-based assessments \nand  forecasting  during  and  after  disasters.  In  addition,  the  TA  team  will  set  up  analytical \nframeworks to more accurately measure disaster impacts retrospectively, both as an added value \nby itself and to integrate the information available for contemporaneous impact assessment \nsolutions. Finally, to jumpstart its capacities and activities toward assessing the risks and impacts \nof epidemics, the TA team will assimilate the findings by the TA for Regional Support to Address \nthe Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Potential Outbreaks of Other Communicable \nDiseases, led by the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department.6 To absorb this \nand other such initiatives across ADB, the TA team will reach out during its initial stocktaking \nphase to all stakeholders through meetings and consultations, and will secure opportunities for \ncooperation and coordination.  \n5. Beyond ADB\u2019s own activities, the TA team will seek to study, assimilate, and cooperate\nwith relevant nowcasting and disaster impact assessment methodologies and initiatives such as\nthe post-disaster needs assessment championed by the World Bank, United Nations, and the\nEuropean Union. Recent technological and methodological advances in weather and flood\nforecasting support nowcasting after the occurrence of specific natural hazards. Examples are\nearly warning systems by countries\u2019 meteorological services, rapid impact mapping, and impact-\nbased forecasting, such as the European Union Joint Research Center\u2019s European Flood Alert\nSystem, and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, which monitors human displacement and the\nbroader  social  and  humanitarian  impacts  of  disasters.  Also  relevant  are  the  systemic  risk\nmodeling approaches developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, which\napply a contagion model to study the cascading impacts of disasters triggered by natural hazards\nor financial stressors. Further examples are propagation studies of economic shocks from natural\nhazards through supply chain networks at Waseda University; risk and impact evaluation studies,\nespecially in relation to disasters, by the ADB Institute; and the broad array of activities and\ninternational  knowledge  transfers  in  disaster  risk  monitoring  and  reduction  by  the  Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency. Beyond those mentioned, the TA team will engage with and\nbuild on all initiatives it finds suitable for adaptation and transfer to DMCs.\n5 ADB. 2018.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: climate and disaster resilience, economic and\nsocial monitoring, and policy formulation in ADB\u2019s DMCs improved.7 The TA will have the\nfollowing outcome: disaster impact assessments and socioeconomic monitoring capacity in\nADB\u2019s DMCs strengthened.8\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n7. Output  1:  State-of-the-art  data  collection  and  nowcasting  technologies  for\ncontemporaneous impact assessments consolidated. This output will involve identifying key\ncategories of high frequency data, key assessment and monitoring contexts, and the methods for\ncollecting and maintaining that data. The TA team will take full stock of the relevant initiatives,\nboth in ADB and elsewhere, identifying experiences and lessons learned, areas and partners for\ncooperation, and overlaps. For example, it will assess the latest data collection and monitoring\ntechnologies  to  track  near-contemporaneous  gross  domestic  product  and  other  headline\neconomic indicators, as well as broader social, environmental, and spatial impact variables. Data\npreparedness will involve ensuring ready access to key sources such as real-time night and\ndaytime satellite imagery; container shipments, air freight, and other granular flight data; mobile\nphone  records  and  crowd-sourced  internet  data  evaluated  through  artificial  intelligence\ntechnologies; and, where available, daily data on local carbon dioxide readings, wind speed,\nrainfall, electric power absorption from national grid data, real-time traffic data from roadway\nsensors and live operations centers, and point of sale consumer transaction data. Besides\ntackling data identification and acquisition, the TA team will put considerable effort into data\nprocessing such as formatting, reducing, and decomposing big data, and making satellite imagery\nsuitable for immediate use by systematically eliminating clouds and other meteorological influence\nfactors. The TA team will also use more structured business network data in combination with\nADB\u2019s unique multiregional input\u2013output tables to capture the whole economic network structure\nin Asia and the Pacific. The TA team will use high-level technology by introducing innovation in\nprocesses, methods, and techniques; addressing climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience to\ndisaster risks; and reducing environmental and/or social costs.9 The TA team will secure the\ncontinuity and sustainability of TA knowledge solutions by effectively absorbing them into ADB\u2019s\nknowledge hubs and data repositories, such as ERCD\u2019s Statistics and Data Innovation Unit and\nthe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s capacity and support structures\nfor the project Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and\nPotential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases (footnote 6). In consultation with the ADB\nstakeholders, the TA team will seek to secure future funding for the data sources identified as\nmost crucial to continuing nowcasting and establishing impact assessment systems. The TA team\nwill also aim to make the outputs effectively replicable for other DMCs at sustainable costs and\nbeyond TA completion, based on the lessons learned from the three or more TA pilot cases. To\ndo so, the team will identify modalities for efficient and timely sharing of tailored data on a\ncontinuing basis for nowcasting activities or temporarily in the case of disaster impact assessment\nand monitoring purposes. Finally, ERCD will continue to cement its partnerships with development\npartners such as the ADB Institute and Japan International Cooperation Agency, as well as with\n7 ADB. 2018.

Use of High-Level Technology in Projects. Memorandum. 21 April (internal). ", "4 \nDMC institutions, to guarantee the effective transfer of TA outputs and their broadest applicability \nand sustainability well into the future.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Data and methods combined and calibrated for ready application to the \nspecific circumstances of the developing member countries. The TA team will identify \nminimum data requirements for nowcasting socioeconomic baseline and disaster-specific impact \nindicators and categorize DMCs with similar characteristics. For each category, the TA team will \nidentify and develop suitable nowcasting techniques, machine learning algorithms, systemic risk \nmodeling, and other suitable approaches, after thoroughly reviewing and assimilating current \nmethods and practices such as multi-hazard risk assessments, early warning systems, and rapid \nmapping approaches. The TA team will combine these methods with available information from \nsources such as remote-sensing data or big data from mobile phone records and social media \nplatforms in order to establish monitoring and impact assessment modules, which will then be \nreadied  for  calibration  to  country-  and  disaster-specific  circumstances.  The  TA  team  will \nundertake pilot studies involving at least three DMCs to demonstrate these modules\u2019 applicability \nto both normal (non-event) and disaster episodes. The TA team will assess the outputs for their \nability  to  provide  reliable,  actionable  information  that  significantly  improves  DMCs\u2019  current \nnowcasting and impact monitoring capacity. The TA team will focus on producing nowcasts and \nother leading indicators for core economic variables that DMCs regularly use. The TA team will \nuse the assessment findings to inform policies on climate adaptation. The TA team will also \ncoordinate  and  share  relevant  information  and  methods  with  DMC  governments  and  their \nagencies by building capacity and conducting training workshops in at least three DMCs. DMC \ninvolvement in capacity building and training activities will depend on their needs and absorptive \ncapacity, including the recipients\u2019 analytical capabilities and readiness to implement disaster \nnowcasting and impact assessments more generally. A key determining factor will be whether a \ncountry\u2019s circumstances are optimally suited to the application and transfer of the specific TA \nanalytical modules as they become ready for the pilot phase. Targeting will also depend on \nparticular events: for example, in response to a major disaster, the TA could readily transfer \nimpact monitoring technology and capacity. The TA team will try to target countries at different \nstages of development with custom-tailored solutions and in as many different Asia and the Pacific \nsubregions as suitable. The TA team will consider gender in data collection and capacity building. \nTo the extent applicable, TA activities will identify and reflect the specific needs of most vulnerable \ngroups, including women, those with disabilities, minorities, caste groups, and other groups likely \nto be disproportionately affected during disasters and socioeconomic shocks.  \n \n9.  Output 3: Retrospective impact assessments and studies accomplished. The TA \nteam will prepare at least five retrospective studies to systemically assess the impacts of past \ndisasters and socioeconomic shocks. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2015 Nepal \nearthquake, and a range of other episodes offer opportunities for analysis to more rigorously \nbenchmark and nowcast the socioeconomic impacts of future such events. For example, a wind \nspeed model, combined with predictive meteorological tracing to project a typhoon\u2019s intensity and \ndamage in near-real time, could integrate the information concurrently emerging from the TA\u2019s \nnowcasting approach. While improving the TA\u2019s nowcasting models, such insights will also \nprovide clues about the effectiveness of disaster early warning systems, with useful policy \nimplications.  The  TA  team  will  prepare  studies  in  collaboration  with  leading  scholars  and \npractitioners, and ADB will publish them as widely accessible technical and working papers, \njournal articles, and policy notes. The TA team will disclose free electronic versions of these \nstudies to the public and, where applicable, disseminate a limited number of printed copies to key \nstakeholders.10 The TA team  will transfer and share the most salient technical aspects of this \n \n10  Copies will be made available on demand from a limited stock between 50 and 200 copies.  \n ", "5 \ncomponent with the stakeholders during capacity building and training activities, and in research \nseminars and international conferences. The targeting of TA individual recipients and participants \nwill include gender and attain minimum quotas. \nC. Cost and Financing\n10. The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed\nin Appendix 2.\n11. The  following  are  ineligible  items  under  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction:  (i)\npurchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long\ninternships, (v) detailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii)\nthose under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities\nList.11\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n12. ADB will administer the TA. ERCD will be responsible for supervising and managing\nconsultants,  procurement,  accomplishment,  and  evaluation  of  the  outputs.  For  optimal\ncoordination and synergy as One ADB, ERCD will collaborate with ADB\u2019s other departments and\nresident missions, especially on capacity building. In particular, regional departments will help\nidentify suitable DMC recipients and facilitate capacity building in coordination with country\nauthorities. For possible research collaboration, joint conferences, and dissemination activities,\nthe TA team will identify and partner with reputable regional or global research institutions.\n13.
