Bangladesh\u2019s transport system consists of roads, railways, inland waterways, seaports for \nmaritime shipping, and civil aviation facilities that cater to both domestic and international traffic. \nHistorically,  the  railway  enjoyed  a  monopoly  as  a  carrier  and  transported  most  principal \ncommodities, including cement, coal, fertilizer, raw jute, stone, food grain, and sugar cane. \nHowever, the railway began losing market share, declining from 30% in 1975 to a mere 4% in \n2015 for both passenger and freight transports. Among the different modes of transport, by 2015 \nroad transportation has become dominant, carrying over 70% of passenger and 60% of freight \ntraffic. The drop in market share of the railway as a carrier is the result of the long-term inadequate \ninvestment  in  railway  infrastructure,  causing  inconvenient  and  unreliable  operations  and \nuncomfortable experiences for passengers. \n \n2.  Efficient  railway  operations  require  an  adequate  number  of  effective  rolling  stock. \nBangladesh Railway had 278 diesel locomotives, 1,249 coaching vehicles, and 8,677 freight \nwagons at the end of fiscal year 2016. However, majority of them are aged over 30 years and the \nold rolling stock is no longer reliable to operate due to frequent malfunctions. \n \n3.  The proposed Railway Rolling Stock Operations Improvement Project will finance the \nprocurement of 40 diesel locomotives, 125 luggage vans for passenger and parcel trains, and \n1,000 vans and wagons for freight trains for use in the major corridors of Bangladesh Railway\u2019s \nnetwork. The proposed project will also finance the consulting services to prepare the detailed \ndesigns for four locomotive maintenance facilities to expedite the preparation of investment \nprojects for urgently required maintenance facilities. The project will also provide institutional \nsupport to mainstream the use of the enterprise resource planning information technology (ERPIT) \nsystem developed under the Railway Sector Investment Program of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).1 The proposed project will enhance the overall operational capacity of Bangladesh \nRailway, and contribute to the modal shift from roads to rail. \n \n4.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) a balanced 3R (rail, river, and road)-\nbased multimodal transport infrastructure system developed,2 and (ii) greenhouse gas emission \nin the power, transport, and industry sectors reduced.3 The project will have the following outcome: \noperational and energy efficiency of Bangladesh Railway improved.4 \n \n5.  ADB assistance in purchasing railway rolling stock will increase the operational capacity \nof Bangladesh Railway by expediting the replacement of old, inefficient rolling stock. The rolling \nstock to be procured under the proposed project will include 40 locomotives equipped with an \nauxiliary power unit (APU), which will be introduced for the first time into Bangladesh Railway. \nAPU will significantly reduce the fuel consumption of locomotives during idling time. The effect of \nAPU  has  been  proven  internationally  and,  in  the  case  of  the  Indian  Railways  in  India,  a \nneighboring country of Bangladesh, APU consumed about 85% less diesel fuel than the main \nengine per hour. The fuel cost savings will  contribute to the improvement of the financial \nperformance of Bangladesh Railway and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

Bangladesh Railway will procure 40 locomotives equipped with APU for the first time into \nits operations. APU will allow the shutdown of the main engine during idling time, reducing fuel \nconsumption and greenhouse gas emissions. APU operation is automatic in principle and there \nare no concerns over the applicability to Bangladesh Railway. However, the realization of the full \npotential of APU can only be achieved with appropriate operations by the locomotive drivers. For \ninstance, a pilot test by Indian Railways, the neighboring country of Bangladesh, showed that only \n43% of potential APU operation hours are utilized due to inadequate operations by locomotive \ndrivers. Due to lack of confidence in APU, locomotive drivers tend to switch off APU for fear of \nunexpected failures during the locomotive operations. Since this is the first introduction to \nBangladesh, it is reasonable to expect that the utilization rate of potential APU operation hours \nwill be less than in the case of Indian Railways. Support for realizing the full potential of APU will \nbe the key to maximizing the effects of the proposed loan project. \n \n7.  The technical assistance (TA) will provide training to locomotive drivers in accordance with \nthe supplier\u2019s operation manuals of APU-equipped locomotives. It will also support Bangladesh \nRailway to establish the training program with the preparations of training materials based on \nwhich Bangladesh Railway will be able to train its locomotive drivers after the proposed project; \nkeeping pace with the increase in APU-equipped locomotives in the future. In addition, as a policy \ndirection for improving the overall energy-efficient operations of Bangladesh Railway, the TA will \nrecommend potential solutions to improve the overall energy efficiency of rolling stock operations. \n \n8.  Considering the TA\u2019s objective to support mainstreaming the use of a new technology in \nBangladesh Railway, the ADB-administered TA will be a better tool than a loan consulting service \nunder the proposed loan project. ADB\u2019s direct administration of the technical assistance will attract \ninternational consultants with adequate expertise in the technology, leading to the selection of the \nbest-suited consultant. Direct supervision of the consultant\u2019s activities by ADB will ensure the \nquality of services in this area that is unfamiliar to Bangladesh Railway. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n9.
