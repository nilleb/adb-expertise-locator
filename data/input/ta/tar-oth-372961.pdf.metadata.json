The project concept paper was prepared by the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment, Governance and Regional Cooperation Division (RSGR). In December 2002 the \nStrategy Meeting of the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund endorsed the Project for funding.  \n \n2.   The regional technical assistance (TA) is designed to create the enabling environment \nfor participatory budgeting in local government by building on global best practices of civil-\nsociety work.1 Participatory budgeting provides citizens with the opportunity to influence and \nhelp make budget decisions. The Project will engage the poor and their representatives in \npreparing budgets that will provide efficient, effective, and responsive pro-poor service delivery. \nIn designing the TA, RSGR considered the involvement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin participatory budgeting approaches and related work on pro-poor service delivery by local \ngovernments.2 \n \n3.  The TA will be implemented in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, which were selected \nbecause they are at various stages of decentralization\uf8e7i.e., they have different levels of local \nresponsibility. Pakistan and Indonesia initiated political devolution and decentralization in the \nearly new millennium, while Sri Lanka embarked on devolution in the late 1980s. Properly \nimplemented, devolution directly reduces poverty as local needs can be answered quickly and \nadequately, and opportunities for development identified early.  \n \n4.  Fact-finding missions have visited the three countries, and government bodies have \nasked ADB to support pilot participatory budgeting in selected districts. The TA goals, purpose, \nand scope are summarized in the TA framework (Appendix 1).3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Access to public service delivery, and service quality are among the main problems cited \nin poverty assessments. The poor often have less access than other social strata to basic \nservice delivery and, when they do, quality is not always sufficient. While most governments \nexpress commitment to improve service delivery, a gap exists between policy statements and \nthe  way  local  governments  raise  and  spend  their  resources.  Another  gap  is  related  to \nresponsibilities of higher tiers of government in financially supporting local government, and to \ntheir public service delivery mandates.  \n \n6.  Engaging civil society in decision making improves public service delivery.4 Involvement \nmay be indirect or direct. Indirect engagement could range from monitoring of public services to \nexpenditure tracking, while direct engagement could include budget review and analysis and \neven joint budget formulation with the local government. This TA focuses on direct engagement \nand builds on local governments willing to work with civil society. Willingness will be measured \nby data accessibility, accuracy, and timeliness. \n                                                 \n1  See,  for  instance,  Budget  Information  Service  by  the  Institute  for  Democracy  in  South  Africa  at \nhttp://www.idasa.org.za/bis  or  Budget  Information  and  Analysis  Services  by  Pathey,  Ahmedabad,  India,  at \nhttp://www.disha-india.org/.  \n2  ADB. 2003.

", "2 \n \n7.  Due to decentralization and devolution all three systems allow for stronger civil-society \nparticipation in decision making. In all three countries systems will be strengthened and further \ndeveloped  to  increase  civic  engagement  in  budget  review  and  in  formulation  of  devolved \nfunctions.  So-called  obligatory  sectors  for  local  governments  in  Indonesia  include  health, \neducation, public works, environment, communications, agriculture, industry and trade, capital \ninvestment, land, cooperatives, and labor and infrastructure services. In Pakistan functions such \nas health and education are devolved to the districts, while water supply, parks, sewage, \nmaintenance of internal roads and sanitation are devolved to the tehsils.5 In Sri Lanka most \ndevolution arrangements have a concurrent list of functions with simultaneous jurisdiction of the \ncentral  and  lower-level  governments.  Often,  the  two  levels  of  government  work  out \narrangements to minimize overlap and unnecessary duplication.  \n \n8.  Government  budgets  are  central  to  planning  and  controlling  a  country\u2019s  economic \nactivities and are important policy tools with profound implications for poverty reduction and \nsocial equity. Civic engagement can contribute to government accountability and to integration \nof a pro-poor perspective into the budget. With ongoing decentralization in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, \nand Indonesia new responsibilities are devolved to local governments. By engaging in local \nbudgeting processes civil society will improve its understanding of allocation possibilities and \nperception and implementation of expenditure and revenue options. Participatory budgeting \nencourages accountable and pro-poor governance. \n \n9.  Incentives for local governments to allow institutionalized participatory budgeting are \noutcome related. Such governments will be more accountable and, as the pilot cases show, \nperform better than those that do not engage in participatory budgeting. The cases also show \nwhat is not achievable under the local government finance system. The incentive for civil society \nto participate is that government will be responsive to community needs and enhance local \nservice delivery.  \n \n10.  The  pilot  local  government  will  institutionalize  budget  education  and  participatory \ndecision making. Lessons from all pilot regions will be exchanged in countrywide outreach \nseminars to enable other local governments to follow such approaches. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to enhance civil society\u2019s awareness of resource allocation and the \nbudgeting process and their actual involvement in the budget decision making process. Through \ncivic, informed, and constructive engagement, public service delivery will be more responsive to \nthe poor. Local pro-poor public service delivery will differ from one pilot to the other due to the \ndifferent stages of development and due to locally made prioritization. The Project will promote \nthat women, who are often underrepresented, and men will participate equally in decision \nmaking. \n \n12.  The TA will build upon work done to date and lessons learned and make use of the \nextensive literature on international best practice in civil-society budget work. The outputs of the \nTA will include the following: \n                                                 \n5 In Pakistan local government comprises district, tehsil and union level.  ", "    3 \n \n(i)  An agreed participatory budgeting strategy.  \n(ii)  Training materials on budget literacy and practical budget work.  \n(iii)  Conduction of twelve regional capacity development workshops.  \n(iv)  Local budget forums (LBFs) operational to develop the principles and practices of \nbudget work in local governments.  \n(v)  Action plan on how to replicate participatory budgeting approaches.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The first major activity is local stocktaking to ensure concurrence with ongoing projects \nand  external  agency  coordination.  The  Project  aims  to  strengthen  other  poverty  reduction \nprojects  by  linking  additional  needs  to  the  local  budget.  Second,  stocktaking  will  include \nbenchmarking  to  describe  local  government  roles  and  functions  and  activities.  Such \nbenchmarking criteria will be developed to allow for measurement of the approaches. \n \n14.  Different local environments do not allow a one-serves-all approach. Therefore, best \npractices  in  global  participatory  budget  work  will  be  introduced  and  discussed  to  achieve \ngeneral agreement on what participatory budgeting strategy will be pursued for this pilot study.  \n \n15.  Training  material  will  be  developed  to  (i)  show  that  civic  engagement  can  make  a \ndifference in budget formulation by building on best practices of civic budget work, (ii) provide \nbudget education, and (iii) show what kind and form of inputs are needed at what stages of the \nbudget cycle. The general parts such as best practices and general budget education will be \ngeneric training material while the others will be designed based on the country or district-\nspecific environment.  \n \n16.  Capacity development workshops will be conducted to (i) develop budget literacy; (ii) \nhelp make budget categories user-friendly; (iii) introduce decision-making processes and tools, \nwhich allow for constructive civic engagement in budget planning and formulation; and (iv) \nstimulate  debate  among  civil  society  and  government  officials.  The  target  groups  are \ngovernment  officials  and  civil-society  representatives.  The  participation  of  women  will  be \nencouraged to allow for adequate representation.  \n \n17.  LBFs will be established, staffed, and equipped to link civil society and local government. \nLBFs  are  intended  to  coordinate  pre-budget  information  and  propose  allocation  decisions. \nDecision-making processes and tools will be implemented at LBFs. \n \n18.  Outreach seminars in each country will advocate reducing poverty by having civil society \nparticipate in the budgeting process. All seminars will primarily target local government officials \nto introduce the approach and show that poverty can be reduced and governance improved \nthrough participation and transparency. The outreach seminars will be supported by an action \nplan on how to start participatory budgeting. The overall lessons will made available through the \nADB web site. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent and will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  from  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  RSGR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  letter  of  no-objection  from  each  of  the \nparticipating  countries  was  obtained  prior  to  the  fact-finding  missions  for  this  TA.  A \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  all  local  governments  will  be  signed  to  serve  as  a \nbenchmark of commitment (Appendix 3). An (international) nongovernment organization (NGO) \nwith extensive practical experience in civil society budget work will be engaged as consultant to \nimplement the TA. Associated domestic NGOs will be hired under the same contract of the \ninternational NGO. Eight person-months of international and 24 person-months of domestic \nconsultancy will be required. The NGO will have links to domestic NGOs and strong interest in \nbuilding long-term relations with them to ensure sustainability of the initiative. The project team \nleader will be a full-time staff of the NGO and coordinate training development, facilitation, and \nother  project  activities  as  well  as  input  of  the  domestic  NGOs.  Domestic  NGOs  in  each \nparticipating country will help implement the TA through workshops and other activities.   \n \n21.  The NGO will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Quality- and cost-based selection and simplified technical proposal will be used to \nengage consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \n22.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The international NGO will be responsible for the procurement of equipment. \n \n23.  The TA will last 8 months beginning July 2004. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for Pilot Project on Institutionalizing \nCivil Society Participation to Create Local Pro-Poor Budgets, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \nImprovement of quality  Improved local  -  Local budgets \nof public service  government service   \ndelivery  delivery to the poor  \n   \n  Budgets responsive to \n  the poor \nPurpose      Purpose to Goal \n        \nEnhance awareness  Active participation of  -  Reports by Local  -  Continued government \nand actual involvement  120 people of civil  Budget Forums (LBFs)  commitment to \nof civil society in the  society in local budget    devolution and \nbudget decision making  works  -  3 ADB review mission   decentralization \nprocess     \n  -  Complementary \n  initiatives to replicate the \n  Project\u2019s success \n   \nOutputs      Output to Purpose \n       \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  government  of  [name  of  local  government]  granted  on  [date]  a  letter  of  non-\nobjection to the Asian Development Bank to implement a \u201cpilot Project on institutionalizing civil-\nsociety participation to create local pro-poor budgets.\u201d This Project will be implemented as a \ngrant.  \n \n2.  Globally, engaging civil society in decision making has improved public service delivery. \nInvolvement is indirect or direct. Indirect involvement often ranges from monitoring of public \nservices to expenditure tracking, and direct engagement from budget review and analysis to \n(joint) budget formulation. This approach focuses on direct engagement and builds on local \ngovernments willing to engage in constructive civil-society participation. Willingness will be \nmeasured as data accessibility, accuracy, and timeliness. \n \n3.  The  Project\u2019s  main  objectives  are  to  establish  accountable  local  governance  and \nenhance civic engagement in budget work. Achieving these interrelated objectives will lead to \nbetter  resource  allocation  decisions  and  service  delivery  mechanisms,  which  will  reduce \npoverty. By engaging in local budgeting processes, civil society will improve its understanding of \nallocation possibilities, perception, and implementation of expenditure and revenue options, and \nlocal governments\u2019 roles and functions under decentralization. \n  \n4.  The Project will build upon work done to date and lessons learned, and make use of \nextensive international best practices in civil-society budget work. The Project will ensure that \nmen and women will be equally represented in decision making. The project outputs include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Implement  a  participatory  budgeting  strategy  and  institutionalize  interaction \nbetween local government and civil society in budget decision making.  \n(ii)  Develop training material to establish budget literacy, demystify budgets, and \nfoster pro-poor budgeting.  \n(iii)  Hold a workshop to develop budget literacy, help develop user-friendly budget \ncriteria, enhance decision-making processes and tools for budget planning and \nformulation, and stimulate debate between civil society and government officials.  \n(iv)  Establish local budget forums (LBFs) to develop the principles and practices of \nbudget  work  in  local  governments,  serve  as  civic-governmental  local  budget \nknowledge centers, and develop solutions for local budget problems. \n(v)  Develop transparent and user-friendly budget criteria to ensure civic engagement \nin budget work and easy translation of public service delivery needs into local \nbudget outputs. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(vi)  Invite  [name  of  local  government]  to  a  national  outreach  seminar  to  inform \nprovincial and local government officials of achievements of the Project and to \ndiscuss its replicability in other local governments.  \n \n4.
