The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (the PRC)  has requested Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to help prepare the proposed Dali-Lijiang \nRailway Project for ADB financing. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the project area in March \n2003,  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  and  a  rapid  environmental \nassessment, and discussed technical and socioeconomic issues with representatives of the \nGovernment, Ministry of Railways (MOR), and provincial and local governments. This paper is \nbased on the understandings reached by the Government and the Mission on the objectives, \nscope, terms of reference, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements \nfor the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country program for 2003.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the last two decades, the PRC experienced sustained rapid economic growth. \nPRC's economic performance has remained robust with economic growth rates of 7.9% in 2000, \n7.2% in 2001, and 8.0% in 2002. The rapid economic growth has resulted in the annual growth \nof passenger transport by 9.2% and freight transport by 7.1% during 1978\u20132001 period. In \n2001, road traffic accounted for 54.8% of total passenger-kilometers (km) followed by railways \nwith 36.2%, civil aviation with 8.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.7%. The modal \nsplit for freight ton-km was 54.6% for coastal and inland waterways, 30.6% for railways, 13.3% \nfor roads, 1.4% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation. \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport in the \nPRC. At the end of 2001, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised 70,086 route- km. The system \nannually carries about one third of the total freight and passenger traffic in the PRC. Between \n1978 and 2001, railway freight grew from 535 billion ton-km to 1,457 billion ton-km, equivalent to \nan annual growth rate of 4.4%. Passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually, increasing from \n109 billion passenger-km to 477 billion passenger-km. Because of the spatial distribution of \nnatural resources, processing plants, and production centers, railways will continue to have a \nmajor role in the transport sector. However, the railway capacity has lagged behind demand due \nto constraints in the railway system. Given the railway's important role, the Government has \nadopted an aggressive plan  to improve the railways and planned network extensions and \nconstruction in the underserved areas with good potential to use  rail services.  \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency of the system by \nusing new technology and modern management tools in planning and operation, (iv) reducing \noperating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  the  commercialization  of  services, \n(v) instituting  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  MOR\u2019s  autonomy  and \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices.  \n \n5.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment as a priority. The plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess to unserved areas with the network length reaching a total of 74,000 km, (ii) providing \n3,000 km of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity, and \n(iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km with the total length of such lines reaching \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2003. ", "2 \n15,000 km. During the plan, a total investment of CNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion for \ncapital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock is planned for the railway sector. Priority \nwill be given to extend railway lines to unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have \nremained less developed. Economic development will be accelerated and incomes of poor \npeople will be increased and poverty reduced. During the first 2 years of the plan (2001 and \n2002), the actual investment in railway construction was about CNY154 billion. \n \n6.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nthe World Bank and ADB. Since 1979, Japan has provided through the Overseas Economic \nCooperation Fund, now combined with the Export-Import Bank of Japan in the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, about Y558 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transportation \ncapacity. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided nine loans totaling over $2.2 billion for eight \nnational  railway  projects  to  expand  railway  capacity  on  high-priority  corridors,  modernize \nsystem-wide technology, and strengthen institutional capabilities and one local railway project. \nADB has focused on the development of railways in less-developed inland provinces to promote \ngrowth and reduce poverty. ADB has provided 10 loans totaling $1.56 billion to finance the \nconstruction of about 1,737 km of provincial railways operated by joint ventures with MOR, and \n3,768 km of new railway lines under three national railway projects. \n \n7.  ADB's operational strategy in the PRC's transport sector focuses on alleviating capacity \nconstraints in the roads and railway sector. Recognizing the important role of railways in the \ntransport system and in promoting regional development, ADB 's strategy for the railway sector \nfocuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing new railway lines, particularly in \ninland poor areas of western region; (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity on key routes \nof the national railway system; and (iii) improving the operations and managerial efficiency and \nthe  commercial  orientation  of  railways.  The  strategy  will  continue  to  focus  on  railways \ndevelopment in underserved areas in poor interior provinces to link lower income regions with \ngrowth centers, to facilitate pro-poor growth that reduces poverty. The policy issues addressed \nin the railway sector include corporatization, marketing and business development, and tariff \nsetting with improved cost recovery. ADB has enhanced policy dialogue with MOR and the \nconsultation will be continued to further the reforms in the sector. \n \n8.  The proposed Project involves constructing 168 km non-electrified railway line in the hilly \nand  mountainous  area  traversed  by  four  rivers  (Dulong,  Jinsha,  Lancang,  Nujiang)  in \nnorthwestern Yunnan Province. The new line will link the main city of Dali with Lijiang City (see \nmap). The influence area includes four prefectures: Dali, Diquing, Lijiang, and Nujiang. The area \nhas 5.2 million people, of which 87.8% (4.6 million) are rural and 57.1% (3 million) are minority \nnationalities. Three of the four counties in Lijiang Prefecture are eligible for national poverty \nfunds.2 Dali Prefecture has 478 poverty villages3 (47.3% of all villages). The project impact area \nincludes 4 counties and cities with a total population of 1.4 million (76% are rural and 73% are \nethnic minorities). Three of the four counties and cities (Eryuan and Heqing counties and Lijiang \nCity) are officially designated as poverty areas by the province. Of the households in the \ninfluence area, 6% are in extreme poverty and more than one-third are economically vulnerable. \nOf the 466 villages, 169 (36%) are poverty villages. \n \n9.  Most people living in the area work in agriculture characterized by a low level of \nproductivity. Despite rich natural resources and good tourist potential, the people have remained \n                                                 \n2  In the PRC, counties eligible for national poverty funds are called national key working counties. \n3  A poverty village is defined as having an average per capita net income below CNY1,052, or more than 70% \npeople below the poverty line, or areas facing the worst natural and poor living conditions. ", "    3 \nlargely poor and cut off from the mainstream development due to lack of transportation. The \nexisting road passes through difficult terrain, has limited passing capacity, and is in poor \ncondition. The railway link will connect the land-locked region of northwest Yunnan Province to \nKunming, Shanghai, and Beijing cities; ports of Fangcheng, Beihai in the PRC, and Haiphong in \nViet Nam and to South and Southeast Asia. The proposed Project will help promote regional \ncooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion countries. \n \n10.  The Project will help develop the railroad network and enhance pro-poor economic \ngrowth. The Project is included in MOR\u2019s updated Tenth Five-Year Plan and will support the \nGovernment\u2019s Western Region Development Strategy.4 The proposed railway will facilitate the \neconomic development and integration of the landlocked and poor region and is expected to \nstimulate industrial and natural resources development, tourism, and related industries. The \nrailway will, in the construction and operation phases, increase market access for local people, \nthus giving them an opportunity to improve their standard of living.  Completed and ongoing \nADB-financed railway projects show that such projects can create a large number of jobs in \nconstruction, loading and  unloading operations, other income-generating activities such as \nmaterial  and  food  supply,  and  small  services  around  the  construction  sites.5  The  lower \ntransportation costs after project completion will make goods and services available at more \neconomic  prices  to  the  poor  population  and  provide  them  the  opportunity  to  sell  their \ncommodities to broader markets. Most people living in the project area have not traveled \nbeyond  the  nearest  towns  due  to  high  transport  fares.  The  railway  will  offer  them  more \naffordable, reliable, and punctual transport than currently available. The Project will improve the \nstandard of living of local people and influence  all aspects  of their daily life, directly and \nindirectly,  in  a  positive  manner.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational \nstrategy and will support the Government\u2019s strategic policy objective of greater developmental \nemphasis on poor interior and underserved areas of the PRC by improving transportation \nlinkage with growth centers. \n \n11.  The  Project  envisages  the  construction  of  a  single-track  railway  line,  including \nsubgrades, bridges, and tunnels. Because of the wide undulating topography along the Dali-\nLijiang Railway route, tunnels and bridges will comprise 45% of the route length. \n \n12.  The Project will be undertaken as a joint venture between MOR and the Yunnan \nprovincial government and will be implemented by MOR. A feasibility study is being prepared \nwith cost estimates that reflect the current prices of materials and construction and traffic \nforecasts. MOR advised ADB that the project proposal is expected to be approved by the State \nDevelopment  Reforms  Commission  by  July  2003.  The  feasibility  study,  the  environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA), and the draft resettlement plan will be submitted to ADB at the same \ntime. The local governments of Dali and Lijiang prefectures confirmed that all the counties have \nimplemented resettlements and assured ADB that based on experience, resettlement under the \nProject will be implemented as per the national laws and provincial regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  DLR is located in Yunnan province of the PRC\u2019s western region. \n5  In the ADB financed Daxian-Waxian Railway Project, the average net income along the proposed alignment of the \nrailway increased by 25% in real terms during the construction period, while the average real increase in \nChongqing Municipality for the same period was approximately 10%. Education is often the first spending priority \nfor PRC families. Because of an improved cash position, some poor people are reportedly no longer indebted for \nschool tuition for the next generation. ", "4 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The TA aims to (i) assist the Government in reviewing and strengthening the project \nfeasibility study, the EIA, the resettlement plan, and related studies to meet ADB's requirements \nfor possible financing; (ii) identify policy measures and institutional development needs that will \nimprove the railway operational efficiency and management, and ensure financial sustainability \nof its operations; and (iii) identify the social dimensions to be incorporated in the project design, \nincluding measures proposed to enhance social development and reduce poverty in the project \narea.  The  output  will  be  a  project  suitable  for  ADB  financing.  The  TA  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The scope of the work under the TA will include (i) reviewing and strengthening the \nfeasibility study to meet ADB' s requirements for (a) technical aspects related to construction \nand operation; and (b) economic and financial analysis, including a review of the traffic forecast \nand financial performance of operation of the project facilities; (ii) developing a set of verifiable \nperformance indicators, including socioeconomic and poverty, and a sustainable mechanism for \nmonitoring, during and beyond the construction stage; (iii) recommending policy measures that \nwill improve railway operational efficiency and management and assessing specific institutional \ndevelopment  needs  to  commercially  operate  the  project  facilities  and  ensure  financial \nsustainability; (iv) reviewing the potential of private sector participation in construction, provision \nof services and tourism development; (v) reviewing and updating the EIA report and preparing a \nsummary EIA with appropriate environmental monitoring and management plans; (vi) reviewing \nand refining the resettlement plan, so that the involuntary resettlement will be implemented \nconsistently with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines; (vii) reviewing the initial poverty and social \nassessment and carrying out a detailed poverty and social analysis, including a baseline \nsocioeconomic profile of the population living in the project area (Appendix 2); (viii) preparing a \ndevelopment  plan  for  ethnic  minorities,  as  per  ADB  guidelines;  and  (ix) undertaking  a \ncomprehensive  distribution analysis of the Project and associated developments on poverty \nreduction (including poverty impact). The key activities will include field surveys; document \nreview; data analysis; and consultation with stakeholders, including government officials, project \nbeneficiaries, and affected people. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $640,000 equivalent consisting of $378,000 in \nforeign exchange and $262,000 equivalent in local currency cost (Appendix 3). ADB will provide \n$500,000  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  a  portion  of  local  currency  cost \namounting to $122,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. MOR will provide the remaining $140,000 equivalent in local currency, for \ncounterpart staff, office facilities, local communications, and support services. The Government \nand MOR were advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing \nproject.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will require about 39 person-months of consulting services comprising about \n15 person-months of international and 24 person-months of domestic consultants spread over a ", "    5 \ntotal period of 5 months. For implementing the TA, a team of international consultants assisted \nby domestic consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB' s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod. The international consultants will have expertise in transport economics and traffic \nforecasting,  financial  analysis,  railway  engineering  and  operation,  environmental  sciences, \ninstitution building, and resettlement and social and poverty analysis. Expertise required from \ndomestic consultants will be in the fields of transport economics and intermodal analysis, \nrailway  engineering  and  operation,  environmental  engineering,  resettlement,  and \nsocioeconomics. Since the tasks and methodology are well defined in the outline terms of \nreference (Appendix 4), the simplified technical proposal procedure will be followed for engaging \nthe  consultants.  The  consultants  will  procure  equipment  in  accordance  with  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n17.  The consultants are expected to commence work in August 2003 and to complete it in \nDecember 2003. MOR, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and \nmonitoring TA activities. The Government and MOR agreed to provide assistance required for \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  MOR  will  make  available  (i)  all  relevant  reports,  studies,  and \ninformation  that  may  be  required  for  implementation  of  the  TA;  (ii)  suitable  office \naccommodation and appropriate and qualified counterpart staff; (iii) local transport facilities to \nvisit the site; and (iv) any other assistance that the consultants may reasonably request, \nincluding liaison with the Government and local authorities. \n \nIV.
