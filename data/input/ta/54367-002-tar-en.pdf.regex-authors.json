THE ENSUING PROGRAM \n \n1.  India has about 63.4 million micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Together \nthey account for about 30% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and 50% of exports, \nand employ 111 million persons.1 The government\u2019s target for 2024 is for MSMEs to account for \n50% of GDP and 75% of exports, while employing 150 million people, in line with a target to make \nIndia a $5 trillion economy.2 The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has severely impacted the lives \nof informal microenterprises, constituting 99% of the MSMEs, owing to lack of managerial \nresources, capacities, and backward-forward linkages to cope with economic downturn. The \ngovernment\u2019s long-term vision to achieve economic growth, creating jobs, and reducing poverty \nin India through MSME development requires critical interventions in the MSME policy and \ninstitutional frameworks. While the government\u2019s Self-Reliant India Mission (Atmanibhar Bharat \nAbhiyaan), announced in May 2020, is conceived to provide liquidity and institutional support for \nMSME survival in the midst of COVID-19,3 an extra effort is needed to channel limited public \nresources  in  a  more  effective  manner  to  improve  MSME  business  practices,  facilitate \ntransformation of their business models, and encourage MSMEs to seize market opportunities \nunder the post-COVID-19 \u201cnew normal.\u201d  \n \n2.  The  ensuing  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program\u2014Strengthening  MSME  Cluster \nEcosystem  through  Institutional  Network  of  Enterprise  Development  Centers\u2014will  improve \nservice delivery to MSMEs building on the four ongoing schemes of the Ministry of Micro, Small, \nand Medium Enterprises (MOMSME)4 adding significant value in MSME cluster planning and \nimplementation, in line with the government\u2019s Self-Reliant India Mission. The RBL program is \naligned with the following impact: economic output and employment generation by MSMEs \nincreased. The program\u2019s outcome will be improved productivity and enhanced competitiveness \nof selected MSME clusters. 5 The key outputs are (i) a network of enterprise development centers \n(EDCs) and a national resource center for enterprises (NRCE) established, (ii) MSMEs\u2019 access \nto enterprise development services enhanced, and (iii) integrated cluster development promoted. \n \n3.  The RBL program reflects the priorities of ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for India, \n2018\u20132022, which identifies boosting economic competitiveness to create better employment \nopportunities as one of the three strategic pillars.6 The RBL program supports Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities); operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality); and operational \npriority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity).7 The RBL program is estimated \nto cost $500 million, of which $250 million will be financed by a regular loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n \n1  Government of India, Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MOMSME). 2019.

The ensuing program and the  transaction technical assistance (TA) are \nincluded in the Country Operations Business Plan for India, 2021\u20132023.8  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  There are multiple government schemes for MSMEs under the MOMSME and other \nministries overseeing food processing, textiles, and other industries.9 However, these schemes \nare  supply-driven,  segmented,  and  suffer  from  limited  resources  and  outreach.  Limited \ncoordination among different ministries at the policy level, lack of integration at the project \nplanning and implementation level, and insufficient monitoring and evaluation for each scheme \nfurther reduce the effectiveness of individual schemes. These inefficiencies should be urgently \naddressed to promote MSME development while driving economic recovery post-COVID-19. It is \ncritical  for  the  government  to  support  the  transformation  of  survival-oriented  informal \nmicrobusinesses to growth-oriented formal SMEs by (i) providing relevant support to individual \nMSMEs in entrepreneurship development, access to financial resources, technology and human \nresources, and business management skill development; (ii) integrating MSMEs into dynamic \nclusters that are part of global value chains (GVCs);10 and (iii) establishing effective institutional \nmechanisms to deliver the intended results.  \n \n5.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  ensuing  program  aims  to  sequentially  enhance  the \neffectiveness of the four MSME schemes (footnote 4) through the following two thematic pillars. \n \n6.  Thematic  Pillar  A:  Institutional  strengthening  through  enterprise  development \ncenter network. District industries centers, under the administrative control of state governments, \nprovide capacity development support for MSMEs. Given that district industries centers face \ncapacity constraints to undertake these functions,11 the MOMSME in 2018 conceptualized setting \nup EDCs at the district level to provide business advisory support and nurture entrepreneurship \ndevelopment. While the ministry has launched 94 EDCs, they require enhancement to provide \nspecialized  technical  advice  to  strengthen  MSMEs\u2019  international  competitiveness,  navigate \nregulatory processes, incubate new local enterprises, and bridge information gaps. The ensuing \nprogram will support the MOMSME to develop business models for the private sector, industry \nassociations,  and/or  civil  society  organizations  to  professionally  manage  EDCs  (para.  11). \nFurthermore, an NRCE will be set up under the MOMSME to oversee EDCs\u2019 service delivery, \nmobilize specialized experts, and serve as a central knowledge hub and discussion forum for \ncoordinating policy interventions. In addition, to improve MSMEs\u2019 access to finance, skilled labor, \nand markets and support their survival in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital platform \n(virtual EDC) will be operationalized to complement the role of physical EDCs. \n \n \n8  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2021\u20132023. Manila. The size of the ensuing RBL program is \nsubject to change during its processing.  \n9 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 November 2020. \n10 Government of India, MOMSME. 2019. Annual Report 2018\u201319. Delhi. About 99% of MSMEs are microbusinesses \nand 83% are unregistered. GVCs refer to international production sharing, a phenomenon whereby production is \nbroken into activities and tasks carried out in different countries. United Nations Industrial Development Organization. \n2019. What are global value chains and why do they matter? August 2019.  \n11 In most cases, district industries centers lack adequate technical manpower, expertise, finance, and results-\norientation; and offer basic administrative services such as assisting MSMEs in applying for government financial \nassistance.  \n ", "3 \n7.  Thematic Pillar B: Strategic cluster development efforts. Cluster-level solutions can \n(i) improve access to common infrastructure facilities to reduce costs; (ii) increase proximity to \nrelated industries for sourcing, learning, networking, and technological upgrading; (iii) improve \naccess to training programs for quality assurance and branding; and (iv) leverage collective \nbargaining power for negotiating with government agencies to remove regulatory barriers. Central \nand state governments have been providing financial support to MSMEs for setting up common \nfacilities centers (CFCs) under their respective cluster development programs.12 However, these \nCFCs are generally developed on a standalone basis without strategic cluster development \nplanning, which can render their usefulness suboptimal. The ensuing RBL program will support \nintegration and alignment of various cluster initiatives.13 A strategic approach towards integrated \ncluster development will also strengthen post-COVID-19 recovery and resilience to the affected \nMSMEs  and  their  employees.  The  RBL  program  will  focus  on  selected  priority  industries \nannounced under the Self-Reliant India Mission and in selected areas.14 \n \n8.  The transaction TA is primarily aimed at advising on the innovative approaches in planning \nand execution of these two thematic pillars of the RBL program, including support for establishing \nprofessional management of the proposed institutional setup, supporting the development of \nassociated government operational systems, and building capacity at selected state and cluster \nlevels for new initiatives such as strategic cluster development to achieve demonstrative effects.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The impact of the TA, aligned with the impact of the ensuing RBL program, is economic \noutput and employment generated by MSMEs increased. The TA will have the following outcome, \nalso aligned with the RBL program: institutional framework strengthened for service delivery and \nMSME cluster ecosystem development. TA outputs 1 and 2 will primarily support pillar A and TA \noutput 3 will support pillar B. The TA outputs will mirror those of the RBL program. \n \n10.  Output 1: Network of enterprise development centers and a national resource \ncenter  for  enterprises  established  and  operationalized.  This  output  will  develop  the \ninstitutional framework and mechanisms of the NRCE and EDCs to support improved service \ndelivery to MSMEs and their clusters. Key activities are knowledge advisory to the MOMSME on \n(i)  developing  a  sound  governance  system  for  the  NRCE  and  operationalizing  its  project \nmanagement unit; (ii) strengthening the NRCE as a knowledge hub for MSME policy and a forum \nfor coordination between central ministries and state governments; (iii) advising the government \nand the NRCE in developing a one-stop-shop online service platform for MSMEs (virtual EDC \nplatform); (iv) advising the government in procuring service providers for EDCs and NRCE; and \n(v) developing an operational framework for NRCE to supplement EDCs\u2019 activities, such as \nmobilizing highly-technical experts for specialized services and promoting exports and value \nchain development in strategic sectors.  \n \n \n12 A CFC refers to a facility that supports part of the production process or value chain common to the cluster MSMEs. \nExamples include testing facilities, raw material depots, tool rooms, effluent treatment plants, and training. \n13Integration  will  include  both  hard  infrastructure  (last  mile  connectivity,  utilities,  effluent  treatment)  and  soft \ninterventions such as skills programs and training programs that enhance the value added by CFCs. \n14 The following 20 priority industries were identified under the Self-Reliant India Mission: (i) electronic products; (ii) \naluminum for defense, construction, and packaging; (iii) auto parts; (iv) electric vehicle components and integrated \ncircuits; (v) textiles; (vi) leather and footwear; (vii) Indian ready-to-eat segment; (viii) medical equipment; (ix) \nagrochemicals; (x) capital goods for industrial machinery and transmission lines; (xi) ethanol; (xii) television; (xiii) \nprocessed marine products like shrimp and tuna; (xiv) food processing; (xv) furniture; (xvi) steel; (xvii) closed circuit \ncamera; (xviii) toys; (xix) sporting goods; and (xx) gym equipment. \n ", "4 \n11.  Innovative solutions will be introduced under this output. First, experts will be recruited to \nadvise on a new institutional framework for EDCs and the NRCE to leverage private sector know-\nhow  in  providing  better  service  delivery.  They  will  support  the  government  to  draw  up \nperformance-based management contracts between the government and the service providers \nthat will manage the EDCs. The experts will also advise the government on procuring the service \nproviders. Second, the TA will support the government in the roll-out of a virtual EDC platform, \nwhich is expected to use innovative modern technology, such as mobile application and artificial \nintelligence-powered chat bot, to expand the EDC\u2019s business development services to MSMEs \nin remote areas and to enable the government to undertake data analytics for its better policy \nformulation.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Improving micro, small, and medium enterprises\u2019 access to enterprise \ndevelopment services. This output will improve MSMEs\u2019 access to critical managerial resources, \nincluding finance and technology resources, and support MSMEs overcome regulatory barriers \nto  enterprise  development.  Key  activities  will  develop  the  capacity  of  relevant  government \nagencies for (i) developing a communication plan to publicize the services provided by the NRCE \nand EDCs; (ii) designing new trainings through EDCs to MSMEs; (iii) improving MSMEs\u2019 access \nto finance through their effective use of existing financial market infrastructure, such as the Trade \nReceivables Discounting System,15 and advising the government on new and innovative financial \nschemes in response to COVID-19; and (iv) improving the four MOMSME support schemes \nthrough the RBL (footnote 4) in terms of environmental and social safeguard management, \ngender empowerment, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Promoting strategic cluster development. This output will support MSMEs \nto undertake cluster development in a strategic manner in cooperation with state governments by \n(i) undertaking cluster mapping and advising the government on prioritization of clusters to be \nsupported; (ii) advising on the design and the implementation of development strategies of the \nselected clusters, including identification of key hard and soft infrastructure requirements and \nexploration of cluster integration to GVCs to strengthen cluster competitiveness; (iii) advising \nMSMEs  in  preparing  their  applications  to  relevant  government  support  schemes;  and  (iv) \ndeveloping specialized trainings for cluster implementing agencies, industry associations, and/or \nMSMEs  running  cluster  special  purpose  vehicles  to  promote  business  relationships  with \ninternational companies. This output will also support documentation and dissemination of best \npractices and successful pilot initiatives for wider replication across India. Furthermore, this output \nwill include ADB\u2019s policy advice to MOMSME on a new financial scheme for greenfield cluster \ndevelopment to supplement the ongoing Micro and Small Enterprises\u2014Cluster Development \nProgram (footnote 4).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program. \n \n \n15 The Trade Receivables Discounting System is an electronic platform for facilitating the discounting of trade \nreceivables of MSMEs through multiple financiers.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division \nin ADB\u2019s South Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. It will also act \nas the focal point and facilitate the consultants\u2019 inputs. The MOMSME will be the executing agency \nand implementing agency. The project management unit under the MOMSME will support the TA \nconsultants and coordinate their activities with the activities under the RBL program. The TA will \nbe implemented from January 2021 to January 2026, since the program period covers 5 fiscal \nyears (FY2022 to FY2026), and to initiate important activities prior to program implementation. \n \n16.
