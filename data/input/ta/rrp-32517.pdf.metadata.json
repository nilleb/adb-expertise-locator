Lax  supervision  and  insufficient\naccountability have distorted performance incentives for supervisors and\nstaff. Inadequate enforcement of commercial laws and regulations, market\nprotection, and administered prices have contributed to ineffective SOE\nmanagement.\nThough established to serve both economic and social goals, SOEs have\nbeen inefficient suppliers of both public and private goods and services.\nThe provision of social services and contribution to regional development\nobjectives has largely been achieved at a considerable cost to society.\nInefficiencies arose because of indiscriminate subsidization and protection\nof SOEs without due regard for economic rationale and competitiveness.\nMoreover, there has been a high degree of exploitation of SOEs for the\nbenefit  of  individuals  and  their  associated  interests,  accompanied  by\ngrowing corruption and collusion or outright fraud. This weak governance\nin the Government\u2019s sphere of influence encouraged violations of rules\nand regulations in the private sector, to the detriment of creditors and\nminority shareholders.\nSOEs\u2019 reliance on two-step foreign currency loans that they received in\nlocal currency has significant long-term budgetary implications. Under the\nstandard  on-lending  arrangements,  the  Government  carries  the  full\nexchange rate risk on both interest and principal for SOEs\u2019 borrowings. In\naddition, substantial amounts of capital injections and debt foregiveness\nhave diverted resources from addressing social development priorities.\nOverall, the costs of holding onto the portfolio of SOEs are significant.\nBesides opportunity cost of capital, the past practice of two-step loans will\nburden the state budget with at least $1.1 billion (Rp11 trillion) per year\nduring the next decade. The direct costs of nonperforming loans from the\nMinistry of Finance (MOF) to individual SOEs is estimated to amount to\n$300 million (Rp3 trillion) annually. This amounts to a total of about $3.9\nbillion (Rp39 trillion) of actual and opportunity costs of the SOE portfolio,\nand does not yet count future debt-to-equity swaps, loan foregiveness in\nthe  context  of  Indonesia  Bank  Restructuring  Agency  (IBRA)  debt\nrestructurings, and liquidations. This total cost of $3.9 billion (Rp39 trillion)\nis equal to four times the expenditure for housing and human settlement,\nfive  times  the  expenditure  for  education,  and  eight  times  the  health\nexpenditure.", "ii\nDespite protection, subsidies, preferential access to public funding, and\nguaranteed access to foreign lending, investments in SOEs have yielded\nsuboptimal returns. While subsidization of SOEs has been scaled down\ndue  to  fiscal  pressures,  many  SOEs  have  raised  additional  debt  or\nstopped servicing their debt obligations to cover operational losses and\nmeet day-to-day obligations. This mismanagement avoids tough measures\nin the nearterm, but it raises the long-term cost of SOE reforms.\nObjectives The  proposed  Program  will  improve  resource  allocation  in  the  public\nand Scope sector, increase profitability of Indonesia\u2019s SOEs, and promote private\nsector participation in all commercial activities of SOEs. Reform of SOEs,\ninvolving  transfer  of  ownership  and  management,  and  confining  the\nGovernment\u2019s role to improving the policy and regulatory framework, will\nrelease scarce resources for poverty reduction and social programs. This\nwill be achieved by (i) subjecting SOEs to sound corporate governance\npractices; (ii) separating commercial activities of SOEs from their public\nservice  obligations;  (iii)  restructuring  and  privatizing  SOEs;  (iv)\nestablishing  fair  and  transparent  procedures  for  managing  labor\nredundancies; and (v) strengthening and effectively enforcing guidelines\nfor procurement in SOEs.\nClassification Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment\nThe  environmental  impact  of  the  Program  has  been  assessed  to  be\npositive.\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan Amount A  $400  million  program  loan  is  proposed  from  the  ordinary  capital\nand Terms resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace\nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's\nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per\nannum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent, conversion options that may be\nexercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan\nregulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines, and such other terms and\nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.\nProgram Period The Government will be able to withdraw funds from the program loan\nand Tranching account during a period of three years starting from loan effectiveness up\nto 31 December 2004. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches. The\nfirst tranche, equivalent to $150 million,1 will be made available upon the\nGovernment meeting the conditions of loan effectiveness. The second\ntranche,  amounting  to  $150  million,  is  expected  to  be  released  by\nJuly 2003 upon satisfactory compliance with agreed upon conditions. The\nthird tranche, amounting to $100 million, is expected to be released by\nJuly 2004 upon satisfactory compliance with agreed upon conditions.\n                                                     \n1 Upon loan effectiveness, ADB shall be entitled to withdraw the front-end fee from the loan account, and pay\nitself on behalf of the Government.", "iii\nExecuting Ministry of Finance.\nAgency\nProcurement and In accordance with the simplified Disbursement Procedures and Related\nDisbursement Requirements for Program Loans,2 procurement of goods and services\nproduced in and originating from ADB's member countries will be made\nwith  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency  in  accordance  with\nstandard Indonesian public sector procedures and normal private sector\ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursement  of  the  loan\nproceeds will be permitted on the basis of a certification provided by the\nBorrower, confirming that in each year in which proceeds of the Program\nare expected to be disbursed, the value of total Indonesian imports minus\n(i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and\n(iii) imports financed under other official development assistance, will be\nequal to or greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during\nsuch year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and\nverify the validity of the certification issued by the Government with each\nwithdrawal application.\nCounterpart The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be\nFunds used to finance the cost of structural adjustments and activities consistent\nwith the Program.\nRisks and The implementation of the Program could be affected by several factors.\nSafeguards The principal risk relates to political uncertainty and its effect on the pace\nof structural reforms. However, there is a firm commitment to SOE reform\nat the highest levels in the new Government and consequently the risk of\nthe Program being diluted or abandoned is limited.\nThe second risk stems from the potential opposition of vested interests.\nFor instance, all the members of the board of commissioners of SOEs are\npublic servants\u2014many of whom have limited relevant skills\u2014for whom\nthe  monetary  and  fringe  benefits  provide  a  considerable  income.\nCorporate  restructuring  and  subsequent  privatization  will  involve\nsignificant changes in the composition of the boards of commissioners,\nand  hence,  loss  of  position,  income,  and  associated  social  prestige.\nFurthermore, many line ministries have traditionally used the SOEs as an\nadditional source of revenue to finance part of their expenditures and\nhave enjoyed wide ranging benefits that will be withdrawn. To counter\nresistance from these vested interests, the proposed system of corporate\ngovernance  is  designed  to  give  management  greater  authority  and\nautonomy, thereby reducing their willingness to collude with incompetent\nsupervising  commissioners.  Furthermore,  the  new  appointment\nagreements for directors and commissioners will radically change the\nincentive  systems  for  both  groups  by  linking  incentives  to  actual\nperformance.\nThe third risk relates to the lack of capacity within the Government to\neffectively oversee and monitor SOE reforms and restructuring in a timely\nand effective manner. In particular, MOF has no principal experience in\neither corporate restructuring or privatization. To address this concern,\n                                                     \n2 R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 23 March\n1998.", "iv\nADB  has  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  enhance  the\nGovernment\u2019s capacity in financial and operational analysis, corporate\nrestructuring,  legal  aspects  of  restructuring  and  privatization,  and\ncorporate governance.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nprogram loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) Governance\nand Privatization Program (the Program).\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. After a protracted period of political uncertainty, on 23 July 2001, Parliament elected\nMegawati Sukarnoputri as the President who appointed a new Government (the Government)\nand Cabinet team. This is the third change of leadership in Indonesia over the last 4 years\n(1998-2001) after the 32 years rule of President Soeharto. Recognizing the urgency of restoring\npublic  and  investor  confidence,  within  a  month,  the  Government  was  able  to  reach  an\nagreement on the letter of intent (LOI) and supportive Memorandum of Economic and Financial\nPolicies with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Arrangements are under way to hold the\nConsultative Group Meeting for Indonesia in November 2001 and the meeting of the Paris Club\nto negotiate the rescheduling of Indonesia\u2019s debt.\n3. Indonesia, like other regional economies, managed to achieve a degree of economic\nrecovery as real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.8 percent in 2000. However, the\ncountry faces significant challenges and has yet to fully reemerge from the severest effects of\nthe  economic  crisis,  when  GDP  declined  by  13.7  percent  in  1998  and  real  wages  and\nemployment  fell  and  poverty  rose.  Foreign  capital  flows  ceased  and  domestic  resource\nmobilization declined in view of economic uncertainty and contraction. These shocks, and the\nrecent global economic slowdown, have adversely affected prospects for Indonesia and have\nrevealed the structural weakness and policy distortions.\n4. To address these structural problems, IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) have together provided substantial policy and technical assistance (TA) support.\nADB\u2019s Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program (FGR:SDP),1 along with\nIMF and World Bank assistance, has supported a set of public sector reforms that have created\nthe basic legal framework and environment for SOE reforms and their audits, and helped to\nimprove financial governance in both banking and nonbanking sectors. The Jakarta Initiative\nTask  Force  (JITF)2  is  facilitating  out-of-court  debt  restructuring  agreements,  while  the\nIndonesian Debt Restructuring Agency (INDRA) provides exchange rate risk guarantee for\nrepayment of restructured debt. Recovery of nonperforming loans of the banking sector is the\nresponsibility of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).\n5. Although Indonesia has made substantial progress in bank restructuring, the corporate\nrestructuring  process  for  both  private  and  state  companies  has  been  slow.  Further\nrationalization of economic policies and enhancement of governance structures, competition,\nand market orientation are critical to ensure sustainable economic growth and efficiency in\nresource allocation. Recognizing this, in parallel to implementing FGR:SDP (footnote 1), ADB\napproved  the  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Development\nLoan3 to enhance domestic and external competition and establish equal opportunities for small\nand medium-size enterprises.\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1618-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program, for $1.4 billion; Loan 1619-INO:\nFinancial Governance Reforms Support, for $47 million; and Loan 1620-INO: Capacity Building for Financial\nGovernance, for $50 million, all approved on 25 June 1998.\n2  Established in November 1999 with support from the World Bank.\n3  Loan 1738\u2013INO: Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program, for $200\nmillion, approved on 16 March 2000.", "2\n6. To coordinate corporate governance activities, the Government has set up the National\nCommittee  on  Corporate  Governance  (NCCG).  NCCG,  with  assistance  from  ADB,4  has\ndeveloped  a  framework  to  improve  corporate  governance,  introduced  amendments  to  the\nCompany  Law  and  other  commercial  laws  as  well  as  measures  to  streamline  company\nincorporation  and  registration  process,  and  improve  accounting  standards  and  disclosure\nrequirements.\n7. To facilitate corporate governance reforms, enterprise restructuring, and privatization,\nthe Government established the Ministry for State-owned Enterprises (MSOE) in March 1998.\nWith the support of ADB,5 MSOE prepared a masterplan in June 2000 that laid down the\nobjectives and scope for the reform of SOEs. This plan envisaged the eventual privatization of\nmost  SOEs,  strengthening  of  their  governance,  and  restructuring  where  required,  while\nremoving  privileges  and  enhancing  credibility  of  the  Government  as  an  independent  and\nunbiased regulator and arbitrator. However, MSOE was abolished in August 2000 and its\nfunctions  transferred  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  While  these  institutional  changes\ndisrupted the privatization of SOEs, the Government continued its efforts to encourage SOEs to\nadopt the governance framework. The new Government reinstated MSOE in August 2001, and\nhas confirmed its commitment to implement the masterplan in a memorandum of understanding\nsigned on 03 October 2001. The strengthening of corporate governance in SOEs, as supported\nby the proposed Program, will lead the way for improving governance in the whole corporate\nsector,  as  well  as  in  other  commercial  operations  of  the  public  sector.  Concurrently,  the\nGovernment is planning to review legislation and regulatory framework for listed companies with\na view to improving enforcement.\n8. The  ADB  Policy  Consultation  Mission  visited  Indonesia  in  September  1998,  and\ndiscussed with MSOE and other key agencies the issues facing the SOE sector and ADB's\npotential support for it. In December 1998, ADB approved an advisory TA to address corporate\ngovernance and privatization of SOEs (footnote 5). Subsequently, the Reconnaissance Mission\nwas fielded in March-April 1999 to develop an agenda for the Program on the basis of the\nrecommendations of the ADB-financed studies and the SOE masterplan prepared with the\nWorld Bank assistance (para. 52). Fact-finding was undertaken in May 1999 to formulate the\nobjectives and scope of the Program and associated TAs and the understandings were firmed\nup during the Appraisal Mission in May 2000. However, the processing of the loan was delayed\nbetween August 2000 and September 2001 because of problems arising from the transfer of\nMSOE functions to MOF, the political changes stemming from the President\u2019s impeachment,\nand the delays in the resolution of issues surrounding the macroeconomic stabilization program\nand structural reforms. Following the resolution of these issues, in August 2001, ADB approved\na TA for privatizing and restructuring SOEs6 and a TA for commercializing of public service\nobligations (PSO),7 both supporting the Program. Subsequent to the inauguration of the new\nGovernment and reestablishment of MSOE, a follow-up mission in September 20018 updated\nthe Program in light of emerging developments and firmed up understandings on the Program.\nThe Government\u2019s Development Policy Letter and the attached Policy Matrix are given in\n                                                          \n4 TA 3484-INO: Corporate Governance Reform, for $300,000, approved on 28 August 2000.\n5 TA  3149\u2013INO:  Corporate  Governance  and  Enterprise  Restructuring,  for  $2.47  million,  approved  on\n29 December 1998.\n6 TA 3714-INO: Privatization and Restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises,  for  $2.6  million,  approved  on  5\nSeptember 2001.\n7 TA 3728-INO: Commercialization of Public Service Obligations, for $1.0 million, approved on 25 September 2001.\n8 The Mission comprised K-P Kriegsmann, Senior Corporate Governance Specialist/Mission Leader; Michael Ryan,\nSenior Financial Sector Specialist; C.C. Fong, Senior Counsel; and Thatha Hla, Young Professional.", "3\nAppendix 1, and the program framework and its monitoring arrangements are provided in\nAppendix 2.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n9. Since the onset of the economic crisis, successive Governments have implemented\nmacroeconomic  stabilization  programs  and  structural  reforms  to  address  the  short-  and\nmedium-term challenges. Significant progress has been made to date in this area. However,\nlack of public confidence, the global economic slowdown, and the slow pace of structural\nreforms over the last several months have created new complications including the disruption to\nthe process of economic revival and fiscal consolidation. These problems were created by a\nweak domestic economy and growing political tensions, due to recurrent civil strife and ethnic\ntensions, the persistent calls for autonomy by resource rich provinces, and the global slowdown\nthat grew in the first half of 2001.\n10.  The  domestic  political  crisis  culminated  in  August  2001  with  Parliament  electing\nMegawati Sukarnoputri as President. Backed by considerable popular support, the President\nwas swift to appoint a strong and competent cabinet and is striving to maintain a coalition to\nbalance diverse and conflicting interests in Parliament. Also, the Government resumed policy\ndialogue with the IMF that resulted in signing of an LOI and agreement on the Memorandum of\nEconomic and Financial Policies and paved the way for the release of the pending third tranche\nof the extended fund facility. The Government expects real GDP to grow in the range of 3.0-3.5\npercent in 2001. The macroeconomic stabilization program aims to adhere to curbing monetary\nexpansion and controlling inflation, and has adopted measures to keep the budget deficit to\naround 4 percent of GDP. These targets are only attainable if the process of asset recovery,\ncorporate restructuring, and privatization of SOEs is accelerated.\n11. The recent change in Government offers renewed hope for more sustained economic\nrecovery of the Indonesian economy, but the vulnerabilities persist given the magnitude of\neconomic issues and the difficult political environment. While growing public debt and the need\nto rein in excess liquidity to curb inflation limit the scope for pursuing expansionary fiscal and\nmonetary  policies,  the  near-term  focus  will  be  on  accelerating  long-delayed  SOE  reforms,\ncorporate restructuring, and asset sales.\n12. During 2000, IBRA intensified its operations and managed net recoveries of $1.8 billion\n(Rp18.1 trillion) from asset sales. Building on this performance, IBRA plans to raise $2.7 billion\n(Rp27 trillion) in 2001 ($1.1 billion, or Rp10.5 trillion, had been recovered by 30 June) and $2.2\nbillion (Rp21.5 trillion) in 2002. MOF and IBRA have agreed on detailed procedures governing\nasset transactions and sales of IBRA\u2019s restructured loans for sovereign bonds. For the 21\nlargest obligors, memoranda of understanding have been agreed for debt resolutions and these\ncases  are  likely  to  be  legally  closed  in  2002.  IBRA  has  filed  legal  action  against  50\nnoncooperating debtors, amounting to $1.3 billion (Rp13.0 trillion) which are expected to be\nresolved in 2002. IBRA supervision was transferred from MOF to the state minister for SOEs in\nSeptember 2001 in order to accelerate bank and debt restructuring and to better coordinate the\noverall asset sales program. Debts not satisfactorily resolved through voluntary mechanisms\ncan  be  subjected  to  bankruptcy  proceedings.  The  Government  has  provided  a  supportive", "4\nregulatory  framework9  for  JITF-led  restructuring.  This  has  enabled  JITF  to  mediate  debt\namounting to $12 billion as of the end of June 2001, representing the debt of 54 companies.\n13. The  Financial  Sector  Policy  Committee  (FSPC),  an  interministerial  coordinating\ncommittee  set  up  in  April  2000,  coordinates  the  activities  of  JITF,  INDRA,  IBRA,  Bank\nIndonesia, MSOE, and MOF. IBRA is empowered to take over assets of recalcitrant debtors.\nThe Government can direct cases to JITF, which has been given the power of referral to the\nattorney general for the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against debtors that refuse to\nnegotiate in good faith. These improvements to the debt restructuring strategy are expected to\ncreate stronger incentives for the debtors and creditors to speed up debt workouts. In April\n2001,  the  FSPC  published  a  set  of  principles  designed  to  promote  economically  viable\nrestructuring of distressed companies through a transparent process that aims to maximize\nrecoveries. The principles also constrain IBRA from extending any future guarantees.\n14. Major initiatives have been under way to strengthen governance and combat corruption.\nThese  have  included  strengthening  of  public  sector  financial  management,  and  the\nestablishment of NCCG to develop a coherent framework for corporate governance for private\ncompanies  (para.  6).  Reforms  are  under  way  in  public  administration  to  enable  effective\ndecentralization.  To  combat  corruption,  the  Government  passed  two  new  laws,  on  \u201cclean\u201d\ngovernment,10  and  eradication  of  criminal  acts  of  corruption.11  Additionally,  a  law  for  the\noversight and audit of private foundations has been approved by Parliament in 2001. Effective\nimplementation of these laws and proper role of oversight agencies is critical to implement\nefficient,  transparent,  and  accountable  public  administration,  and  to  encourage  citizen\nparticipation.\n15. Within this context, the implementation of a rigorous system of corporate governance for\nSOEs is critical and is viewed to lead the reforms for the overall corporate sector. Successful\ncorporate restructuring, especially debt restructuring, of SOEs provide models to accelerate\nrelated efforts in the private sector. Privatizations through stock exchange listing will promote\ncapital market development. SOE reforms will also establish the best practices in managing\nlabor redundancies.\nB. Recent Performance and Prospects\n16. Over the past five years, Indonesia has shown remarkable resilience and lived through\nan unprecedented economic crisis and the associated political and social unrest. Despite these\nevents,  the  economy  showed  resilience  and  real  GDP  grew  to  4.8  percent  in  2000  after\nregistering  a  sharp  contraction  by  13.2 percent  in  1998.  The  growth  prospects  for  2001,\nhowever, have weakened in light of the continued weak domestic demand, sharp slowdown in\nexports  triggered  by  global  slowdown,  political  uncertainties,  and  protracted  delays  in  the\ncorporate restructuring process. Real GDP growth is estimated to be in the range of 3.0 to 3.5\npercent in 2001 (para. 10).\n17. To maintain macroeconomic stability, the Government in 2001 has kept a close watch on\nfiscal management. Despite monetary tightening in the first half of the year, monetary expansion\nrose to 18.5 percent on an annualized basis over the second quarter of 2001. The slippage is\n                                                          \n9 These include the introduction of tax relief for a broad range of restructuring transactions, and regulatory protection\nat the Jakarta Stock Exchange to prevent delisting for cooperating companies.\n10 The law State Administrators who are Clean and Free from Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism, defines rights and\nobligations of state administrators.\n11 The Eradication of Corruption Criminal Act defines corruption and declares it a criminal act to be punished with four\nto twenty years imprisonment.", "5\nlargely on account of the downward pressures on the exchange rate, which fell to lows of\nRp12,000 to the dollar in April 2001 (compared to Rp7500 in April 2000) at the peak of political\nuncertainty.  Following  the  impeachment  of  President  Wahid  on  23  July  2001,  the  rupiah\nappreciated by 30 percent but subsequently fell back to its current level of about Rp10, 500 per\nUS$1. The steep fall in the value of rupiah, Bank Indonesia\u2019s failure to control liquidity, and the\nrise in fuel prices during 2001, created strong inflationary pressures. By July 2001 the 12 month\nincrease in consumer prices reached a two-year high of 14 percent, up from 4.2 percent a year\nearlier. Higher inflation and political uncertainty resulted in a rise of interest rates. The yield on\nthe one-month central bank certificates (SBIs) stood at 17.6 percent in late August 2001, up\nfrom 14.5 percent at the end of 2000.\n18. The current account surplus increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to 5 percent in\n2000 but is expected to contract significantly during 2001. Weaker external demand and lower\nnatural gas exports will not be fully offset by the projected fall in imports. Maintaining a current\naccount surplus is of vital importance for Indonesia to be able to meet its debt servicing\nobligations as capital inflows are likely to remain constrained well into and possibly beyond\n2002. IMF and World Bank are projected to have negative net lending (repayments are higher\nthan disbursements) amounting to about $1.0 billion in 2001 and 2002. Commercial banks and\nother private creditors are expected to reduce their exposure by $8.6 billion in 2001 and $6.0\nbillion in 2002. This leaves a net financing gap of $1.5 billion in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2002 in\nthe capital account of the balance of payments, which should be met by multi- and bilateral\ndevelopment agencies.\n19. The economic slowdown during the first half of 2001 has imposed severe strains on the\nbudget. In line with the IMF program, the Government has scaled its budget deficit target to 3.7\npercent of GDP by raising tax revenues by $650 million (Rp6.5 trillion) and reducing subsidies\nby $930 million (Rp9.3 trillion). Parliament in mid-June passed the new budget. Managing a\nresponsive, yet responsible, fiscal policy is an urgent concern. Among others, it is critical to deal\nwith the issue of the massive buildup of public debt to $127 billion (Rp1,270 trillion). By the end\nof 2000, this is close to 100 percent of GDP. About half the debt is owed to foreign creditors,\nincluding $20 billion to multilateral institutions, $43 billion to bilateral creditors, and $2.4 billion to\nforeign  banks  and  bondholders.  Interest  payments  alone  currently  absorb  31  percent  of\nbudgetary  revenues,  curbing  the  availability  of  resources  to  address  social  development\npriorities. The Government plans to launch an aggressive sale of IBRA assets and SOEs to\nmobilize the required resources for debt repayments. Sound macroeconomic policies supported\nby prudent fiscal management and proper and timely implementation of privatization of SOEs\nwill be critical for meeting these goals. In view of the important role of privatizations for future\nbudgets, the Government has placed a high priority on SOE reform.\nIV. THE SECTOR\nA. Background and Recent Performance\n1.  Overview of Corporate Sector and Structure of SOEs\n20. The economic vulnerability of Indonesia, as exposed by the crisis, is largely attributable\nto the inherent structural weaknesses across key sectors of the economy. In the corporate\nsector,  the  complex  holding  company  structures  with  concurrent  ownership  of  banks\nencouraged the development of a web of nontransparent and highly leveraged conglomerates.\nThese conglomerates indulged in lending to related parties, expanded their operations without\ndue regard for economic or prudential considerations, exploited depositors of their banks, and\ndispossessed minority shareholders who held stakes in their listed subsidiaries. Excessive", "6\nleveraging, without adequate prudential regulatory framework and supervision, overexposed the\nfragile domestic banking sector. Reckless lending and borrowing were worsened by currency\nand maturity mismatch in the banks\u2019 balance sheets. Following the currency devaluation, a large\nsegment of the corporate sector became insolvent. Corporate losses and the inability and\nunwillingness to repay debt obligations wiped out the equity of many banks that were overly\nexposed to commercial and speculative adventures of their majority owners. Although less\nleveraged and not so severely affected by the crisis as private enterprises, SOEs too suffered\nfrom growing operational and financial inefficiencies, and many require restructuring.\n21. At a general level, Law No. 9/1969 provides for four main types of SOEs:\n(i)  perusahaan jawatan (perjan), government departmental agencies established to\nfulfill PSOs, do not have separate legal existence, their employees are civil\nservants, and 15 perjan are under MSOE administration;\n(ii)  perusahaan umum (perum), were established as separate legal entities under a\nspecial purpose Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah), their capital is\nowned by the Government and is not divided into shares, and 13 perum are\nunder MSOE administration;\n(iii)  perusahaan persero (persero) is a limited liability company established according\nto Law No. 9/1969 and the Company Law, and at least 51 percent of its shares\nare owned directly by the Government;12 and\n(iv)  other types of SOEs can be established under special laws; an example is the oil\ncompany, Pertamina.\n22. As of September 2001, MSOE has a portfolio of 155 companies comprising five fully-\nowned state banks; 12 nonbank financial institutions; 21 companies with the Government as\nminority shareholder; and 117 fully-owned nonfinancial SOEs, which are the primary target of\nthe proposed Program. Four SOEs are not to be privatized before 2008.13 A breakdown of the\n113 remaining SOEs is given in Table 1, the coverage of SOEs by the different program\ncomponents is outlined in Appendix 3.\n2.  Size and Significance of State-Owned Enterprises\n23. Traditionally, SOEs have operated in all key sectors of the economy. In 1999, total\nassets of the 113 SOEs (book value) to be privatized (para. 22) were $39 billion (Rp391\ntrillion),14 equivalent to 42 percent of the total assets of Indonesia\u2019s producing sector. SOEs\nemployed 655,000 persons on a full-time basis. However, including their subsidiaries and the\ncontract and subcontract workers, the total workforce of SOEs was close to 1.4 million, or 18\npercent of the workforce in large and medium enterprises. The contribution of SOEs to the\ncountry's GDP was estimated at 12 percent, indicating a relatively low efficiency in the use of\nlabor and assets.\n                                                          \n12 There are 134 perseros under MSOE administration.\n13 The four SOEs are PT Batan Teknologi, producer of isotops for medical radiology; PT Pakarya Industri, holding\ncompany for strategic SOEs (proposed for liquidation); PT TWC Borobudur, providing administration services for\nhistoric monuments in Yogyakarta; and PT Pindad, an ammunition manufacturer.\n14$53.2 billion at the 1999 foreign exchange rate (Rp7,350); excluding assets of insurance companies.", "7\nTable 1: Breakdown of Nonfinancial SOEs\nFinancial Year Ended 2000\nSector Number Share in Workforce Share in Assets (%)\n(%)\nEnergy 2a 8.3 61.7\nInfrastructure 10 14.4 13.7\nPost 1a 4.1 0.5\nTelecommunications 2 6.4 9.1\nToll Roads 1a 1.0 1.8\nPorts 4 1.8 1.6\nAirports 2 1.8 1.6\nPrimary industries 29 55.5 5.1\nPlantations 14 51.5 2.8\nFishing 4 0.4 0.1\nForestry 5 1.4 0.5\nMining 4 2.3 1.6\nAgricultural Inputs 2 0.1 0.1\nManufacturing 31 9.6 11.7\nConstruction 10 1.0 1.3\nTrade 5 0.8 1.3\nServices 26 9.9 5.2\nTotal 113 100.0 100.0\nAddendum:\nSOEs not to be privatized 4\nBanks 5\nNonbank Financial 12\nInstitutions\nMinority Shareholdings 21\nTotal Portfolio 155\na Reforms of these SOEs are dealt with under ongoing World Bank and ADB loans and TAs (para. 57).\nSource: Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises.\n3.  Financial Performance of State-Owned Enterprises\n24. In 1999, SOEs15 accounted for 15 percent of Indonesia\u2019s total exports and 19 percent of\nnonmineral fuel exports in US dollar terms. Benefiting from currency depreciation, SOE exports\nregistered a windfall of $600 million (Rp6 trillion) in 1998, which declined to about $400 million\n(Rp4 trillion) in 1999 and $250 million (Rp2.5 trillion) in 2000. In 2001 the weak currency is\nexpected to increase the windfall to about $450 million (Rp4.5 trillion). This contributed to\nenhanced operating profit that rose from $730 million (Rp7.3 trillion) in 1997 to $1.6 billion\n(Rp15.6 trillion) in 2000. The return on assets in the SOE sector increased from 3.3 percent in\n1997 to 6.9 percent in 2000, but still remained below the cost of capital. The rise in profitability\ndoubled the contribution of SOEs to the budget in the form of dividends, from $150 million\n(Rp1.5  trillion)  in  1997  to  $350  million  (Rp3.5 trillion)  in  2000.  However,  with  the  slowing\ndomestic economy and the rise in cost of inputs and labor, improved profitability of SOEs is\nunlikely to be sustained in 2001. The forecast for 2001 in Table 2, on the basis of company\nbudgets submitted to MSOE in January 2001, are probably too optimistic.\n                                                          \n15The financial data in this section excludes PT PLN because of its extraordinary circumstances and distorting effect\non the data.", "8\n25. Overall, the financial position of SOEs has remained mediocre in recent years (Table 2).\nAn example has been the rapid growth in losses of the power utility, PT Perusahaan Listrik\nNegara (PLN), because of its inability to adjust electricity tariffs in line with rising input prices\nand debt servicing costs.16 The decline of shareholder value in SOEs, as assessed by the\neconomic value-added (EVA)17 concept, is estimated at $1.4 billion (Rp13.9 trillion) in 2000,\nequivalent to 180 percent of social expenditures in 2000. Including PLN, EVA is estimated at\nnegative  $3.7  billion  (Rp36.7  trillion),  equal  to  2.8  percent  of  GDP,  or  17.9 percent  of\ngovernment revenue and grants in 2000.\nTable 2: Aggregate Financial Data for\nSelected Industries\nIndustry Year Employees Assets Operating Return on Debt Equity\n(Rp\u2019000) Profit Margin Assets Ratio\nPlantations\n1997 293,443 8,368,138 16.9% 8% 0.65\n1998 329,662 11,676,678 42.8% 25% 0.52\n1999 358,659 11,140,381 14.4% 8% 0.57\n2000 337,164 11,000,946 12.9% 6% 0.53\n2001a 356,872 12,116,780 19.1% 6% 0.60\nMining\n1997 16,702 4,054,873 19.6% 6% 0.51\n1998 15,550 5,319,398 42.6% 20% 0.53\n1999 15,039 5,542,065 27.5% 15% 0.49\n2000 14,930 6,431,046 25.2% 14% 0.66\n2001a 14,125 6,985,302 24.5% 14% 0.66\nManufacturing\n1997 82,141 27,983,893 9.9% 3% 1.02\n1998 81,637 35,813,787 10.8% 3% 1.25\n1999 77,669 32,261,897 12.1% 6% 1.19\n2000 76,056 36,693,098 13.8% 6% 0.55\n 2001a 74,008 40,993,698 13.2% 6% 0.73\nInfrastructure\nexc.

If EVA is positive, the company creates shareholder value. If\nEVA is negative, the company destroys shareholder value. In the portfolio of MSOE of 134 SOEs, only seven SOE\ncreated shareholder value (positive EVA) in 2000.", "9\n26.     Despite their poor profitability, proceeds from the sale of SOEs could finance a part of the\nbank restructuring cost. Based on the 2000 net profit after tax, the market value of all SOEs,\nexcluding  banks,  is  estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  Rp126  trillion  (staff  estimate)  and\nRp208 trillion (Government estimate), or $13 billion to $22 billion. This is equivalent to 60\npercent and 102 percent, respectively, of the market capitalization of Jakarta Stock Exchange\n(JSE).\nB.  Constraints and Issues\n1.  Corporate Governance\n27. Eight SOEs are listed on JSE18 (including Bank BNI) and subject to capital market\nregulation. The other 126 SOEs are limited liability companies, subject only to the corporate\ngovernance provisions of the Company Law. To adequately monitor their performance and\nguide corporate restructuring efforts, MSOE, in a first step, needs to raise the governance of\nthese SOEs to the level required for publicly listed companies. However, corporate governance\nin SOEs involves more complex problems compared to those prevailing in enterprises listed on\na stock exchange. The supervisory board and management of SOEs are quite removed from\ndirect accountability to the shareholders. They have no direct responsibility toward the ultimate\nshareholder, the taxpayer, nor do the taxpayers have any legal means of seeing their interest\nrepresented. In May 2000 Indonesia introduced specific rules and regulations for corporate\ngovernance in SOEs.19 Furthermore, external mechanisms of corporate governance enforced\nthrough financial markets or banks, have also been largely absent as SOEs enjoyed easy\naccess to credit from state-owned banks and directly from MOF. SOEs have, therefore, tended\nto mainly serve the interests of the state bureaucracy leading to such excesses as directed\nallocation of contracts to favored suppliers; use of profits to support nonviable new ventures;\nand outright corruption, collusion, and nepotism (KKN). To overcome these problems, MSOE\nneeds  to  implement  a  system  of  corporate  governance  that  overcomes  the  shortcomings\noutlined on paras. 28-35, and goes beyond the prescriptions of capital market regulations.\nThereby it will pioneer the way for the Government\u2019s efforts to improve corporate governance for\nthe private sector, to be designed and implemented by NCCG (para. 6). In a first step, NCCG\nhas issued a Code of Good Corporate Governance in April 2001, fully complying with the\nOrganization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  Principles  of  Corporate\nGovernance. However, compliance with the code by companies is voluntary until the code is\nreflected  in  the  new  company  law  and  capital  market  law,  envisaged  to  be  enacted  by\nParliament in 2002.\n28. The Civil Code, the Commercial Code, the Company Law and its regulations provide the\nlegal and regulatory framework for the establishment, operation, and dissolution of companies\nwith limited liability, and the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of shareholders, managers\n(directors),  and  supervisors  (commissioners).  Securities  issuers,  and  public  and  listed\ncompanies are subject to capital market laws and regulations. The Company Law applies to\nlisted companies, except where capital market regulations prevail. SOEs covered under the\nProgram are limited liability companies governed by the Company Law. SOEs listed at JSE are\nadditionally subject to the rules and regulations of the Capital Market Supervisory Agency\n(BAPEPAM). Listed companies are additionally subject to the listing rules of JSE.\n29. The internal governance of companies as defined in the Company Law provides for\na dual  board  structure  for  limited  liability  companies.  The  board  of  directors  (BOD)  is\n                                                          \n18 The six SOEs named in footnote 32 plus PT Indofarma and PT Biofarma, which were listed in 2001.\n19 Ministerial Decree Kep 23 of May 2001, Corporate Governance in SOEs, issued by the Minister for Investment and\nSOEs.", "10\nresponsible  for  the  management  of  a  company,  while  the  board  of  commissioners  (BOC)\nmonitors and advises them.20 The annual general meeting of shareholders has broad authority\nas it holds powers generally not granted by the Company Law or by the company\u2019s articles of\nassociation to the BOD or BOC. The Company Law does not, however, stipulate consequences\nfor a company\u2019s failure to comply with its provisions. Regulation of the corporate sector is\noverseen by the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Industry and Trade, District Courts, commercial\ncourts, BAPEPAM, and JSE (for listed companies). Licensing and regulatory responsibilities for\ncompanies that are engaged in commercial activities are with the concerned sector ministries.\nBank Indonesia and MOF regulate the banking and insurance sectors, respectively.\n30. The BOD of a company must administer, and allow for the inspection by shareholders of,\nthe company\u2019s books and records. However, the Company Law does not specify what books\nand records must be maintained. To be meaningful, the reports should provide audited financial\nstatements,21 describe the management and operations of the company, and list the names and\nremuneration of the members of the BOD and BOC, as well as their interest in the company and\nthe company\u2019s commercial transactions.\n31. Audits of a company\u2019s financial statements are not compulsory. Listed companies or\ncompanies involved in public fund-raising or those that have issued an acknowledgment of\nindebtedness, or companies with assets valued at least Rp50 billion (which is the case for\n107 of the 117 SOEs) are required to prepare an annual report. Since 1998, these companies\nare required to provide their annual report to the Minister of Industry and Trade22 within six\nmonths from the end of their financial year along with audited financial statements prepared in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Compliance to date has\nbeen very poor. Public companies and securities issuers are required to submit annual and\nquarterly reports and financial statements to BAPEPAM with information on their company\nactivities;  their  BODs  and  BOCs;  use  of  funds;  and  investment  and  share  ownership  of\ndirectors, commissioners, and shareholders. While the reporting requirements are substantial,\ncompliance has been weak, and largely depending on the integrity of management.\n32. The Indonesian generally accepted accounting standards (GAAP) are determined by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (Dewan Standar Akuntansi Keunangan, or DSAK), which\nis part of the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IIA). Together with the regulations for listed\ncompanies stipulated by BAPEPAM, they define financial accounting standards. In 1994, DSAK\nmade the strategic decision to harmonize the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards with\nthe International Accounting Standards (IAS). The DSAK has issued 55 accounting standards,\n35 in 1994 and 20 over the last six years, which are consistent with the recommendations of the\nInternational Accounting Standards Committee. Although IAS are not commonly adopted by\nIndonesian companies, in most cases there is little difference between IAS and Indonesian\nGAAP.\n                                                          \n20Indonesian law is based on Dutch law and prescribes a two-board structure consisting of supervisory board and an\nexecutive board. Under the Indonesian law, the commissioners are the equivalent of nonexecutive directors in\nEuropean companies and form the BOC, vested with all supervisory functions, while the Directors are the\nequivalent of executive Directors in European companies and form the BOD, which is responsible for managing all\ncompany affairs. By contrast, under the Anglo-Saxon law system, companies with limited liability have one BOD\nconsisting of executive Directors and non-executive Directors.\n21Including a balance sheet, a profit and loss statement, a cash flow statement, a statement of debt and receivables\n(including bank credits), a list of shareholders, and explanatory notes.\n22Decree of the Minister of Industry and Trade No. 525/Kep/XI/1998 of 13 November 1998 on Administration and\nRegistration of Annual Financial Reports of Companies. Currently, the Minister of Industry and Trade has\ndelegated the relevant authority to the Company Registration Office in the Department of Industry and Trade.", "11\n33.  Overall, Indonesia's corporate and commercial system is not working under a robust\nsystem  of  corporate  governance.  Existing  rules  and  regulations  have  not  been  rigorously\nenforced, in private companies or SOEs. External mechanisms and enforcement through banks\nand capital markets, which are a feature of corporate discipline in other countries, have not\nfunctioned well in Indonesia. There has been little incentive for internal mechanisms or voluntary\nbest  practices  to  be  introduced.  As  a  result,  the  following  mechanisms  common  in  other\ncountries are either unavailable or only nominally available:\n(i)  comprehensive  disclosure  in  corporate  reporting,  independent  directors  or\ncommissioners  safeguarding  the  rights  of  minority  shareholders,  and\ntransparency in financial dealings with related parties;\n(ii)  sound legal system, with a good record of enforcement by an impartial judiciary\n(breaches  in  corporate  governance,  even  if  detected,  were  not  pursued  for\njudicial resolution); and\n(iii)  external discipline exercised by the financial sector (for a complex web of well-\nconnected individuals and conglomerates, capital was readily available before\nthe crisis).\n34. Apart from enforcement of general standards, corporate governance should establish\nproper  ownership  and  control  structures  for  SOEs  that  align  risk  borne  by  owners  with\nmanagement control to improve their financial and operational performance. A fundamental\nproblem in SOEs is that those who bear the risk of losses\u2014the public\u2014can neither control\noperations nor escape losses. For the internal governance of corporatized SOEs to be effective,\nthe  Government  needs  to  enforce  rigorous  accountability  and  transparency,  and  provide\nautonomy  and  adequate  incentives  to  supervisors,  managers,  and  employees  to  meet\ncommercial objectives.\n35. Contractual arrangements between the shareholder, BOC and BOD, where they exist,\nare not uniform or transparent, and do not establish clear accountability. Consequently, it is\ndifficult to assess the performance of BOCs and BODs whose appointments in most cases are\nnot based on merit. As a consequence of the lack of systematic contractual arrangements and\nadequate management information systems, MSOE has only rudimentary knowledge of the\nSOEs in its portfolio. Internal organizational and capacity constraints have limited responsible\nGovernment  agencies\u2019  ability  to  develop  information-processing  capabilities.  The  SOEs\ngenerally disregard their legal obligation to file audited financial statements with the Company\nRegister. Since MOF represents the Government as the sole shareholder in 134 SOEs, it\nshould have regular and unlimited access to the relevant financial, operational, and strategic\ninformation of SOEs.\n2. Public Service Obligations\n36. The Government has in many cases used SOEs to provide public goods and services to\nthe  population.  These  range  from  transportation  services  in  remote  areas  to  vocational\neducation and health care services. Political interference in the pricing of such services and\ninadequate  accountability  in  SOEs  have  resulted  in  inefficient  delivery  mechanisms.  The\nservices are either cross-subsidized by profitable business units in the SOE or subsidized by the\nGovernment. This practice diverts resources from profitable activities, lowers overall returns,\nand impairs the growth potential of SOEs, while eliminating incentives for efficiency in the\nprovision of PSOs. Currently a large segment of SOEs are entrusted with PSOs, such as\nobligations to provide for reforestation services in Sumatra and Kalimantan, supply vaccines at\nbelow cost prices to the public health system, maintain unprofitable air and shipping services,\nand  operate  remote  air  and  sea  ports.  PSOs  should  be  contracted  out  separately  and", "12\ntransparently to ensure full cost recovery by their provider. The Government has corrected some\ntariff and other fiscal distortions as part of its structural adjustment program, but subsidies,\ncross-subsidies within SOEs, and directed price fixing continue. To increase transparency and\nachieve full management accountability for commercial success, the Government needs to\nseparate PSOs from commercial activities in SOEs in preparation for their eventual privatization.\nWithout such separation, SOEs cannot achieve a return on capital sufficient to attract private\ninvestors.\n3.  Corporate Restructuring\n37. Corporate restructuring includes financial (debt) and operational restructuring. To date,\n10 SOEs have reached debt-restructuring agreements with their creditors, 8 have ongoing\nnegotiations, and 1 has been sued for bankruptcy.23 The financial restructuring of SOEs (except\nbanks) has proceeded slowly as (i) the Government is not pressing for debt restructuring as it\nmay add to the already high fiscal costs incurred in bank restructuring, and (ii) creditors (in the\nmajority state-owned banks) are reluctant to pursue SOEs with the same vigor as private sector\ndebtors. Financial restructuring is needed in at least 40 SOEs with unsustainably high levels of\ndebt, 16 of which have IBRA as the main counterpart in their debt restructuring negotiations.\nThe other 24 SOEs have state-owned banks and MOF as their main creditors. Another 17\nSOEs have debts that are with IBRA and are expected to be resolved on commercial terms.\n38. Operational restructuring is needed in at least 87 SOEs given their poor operational\nperformance  even  before  the  crisis.  Operational  restructuring  requires  adequate\n(i) management  information  systems,  (ii) production  and  logistics  planning,  (iii) distribution\nnetwork,  (iv)  marketing  strategy,  (v) workforce  number  and  composition,  (vi) organizational\nstructure, and (vii) separation of PSOs from commercial operations. SOEs have about 10-20\npercent24  excess  labor,  inflexible  production  processes,  inadequate  strategic  planning,\nunreliable distribution networks, and no long-term marketing strategy. An approach to SOE\ncorporate restructuring is to involve the private sector at an early stage, but the widespread\ninsolvency has complicated this option as few domestic banks or corporations have resources\nto lend to or invest in the SOE sector. Even fewer have the managerial capacity to acquire\nnonperforming state assets and to turn them around. The alternative is to restructure viable\nSOEs with the objective of eventual privatization involving overseas portfolio and strategic\ninvestors. However, where restructuring involves the injection of fresh capital, it has to be left to\nfuture private owners.\n39. The Government is committed to support financial and operational restructuring of SOEs\nand their privatization without, however, supporting new investments for merger, modernization,\nor expansion of existing production facilities.25 Corporate restructuring of SOEs will complement\nand reinforce the tasks of (i) JITF which is facilitating the voluntary resolution of corporate debt;\n(ii) IBRA, charged with resolving or liquidating non-performing loans in its portfolio; and (iii)\nINDRA, which facilitates the conversion of foreign currency-denominated debt into rupiah at\nguaranteed exchange rates. Together, these initiatives are to assist almost 2,000 private and\npublic  sector  enterprises.  Consistent  with  these  initiatives,  the  Government  identified  for\nfinancial restructuring 60 SOEs, 40 of which require urgent action (para. 42). Furthermore, MOF\nwill  not  provide  financial  restructuring  support  to  any  SOEs  that  can  self-finance  their\nrestructuring program, or will not be privatized, or require regulatory reform prior to restructuring\n                                                          \n23The Vietnam Frontier Fund filed a bankruptcy suit in May 1999 against PT Dok and Perkapalan Kodja for its failure\nto pay $100 million in promissory notes.\n24 Based on some recent estimates, the actual level of overstaffing may be closer to 10 percent.\n25 The Government has demonstrated this commitment in the case of PT Indo Farma and PT Kimia Farma, where the\nproceeds from the IPO went to the companies to be used for corporate restructuring.", "13\nand privatization. These SOEs will, however, receive support under the proposed Program for\ncomplying with regulatory reforms, improving corporate governance, applying anticorruption\nmeasures, and offering voluntary retirement schemes.\n40. The  Government  plans  to  reform  SOEs  with  long-term  viability  whose  value  to  a\npotential investor would be enhanced by financial and operational restructuring, and to consider\nfor immediate sale or liquidation those that have no commercial viability and lack any value as\ngoing concerns. Preliminary analysis indicates that at least 14 SOEs lack commercial and\nfinancial viability.\n41. Financial restructuring will take place within a well-defined legal framework, enforced\nthrough newly established institutional arrangements. Commercial courts, which constitute a\npart of the general court system, have the mandate of hearing bankruptcy and commercial\ncases relating to arbitration, competition, and security issues. These courts are entrusted with\nthe application and enforcement of the Bankruptcy Law to facilitate and encourage corporate\ndebt restructuring. The Bankruptcy Law, amended substantially in 1998, aims at (i) improving\nthe speed and transparency of cases; (ii) drawing receivers and administrators from the private\nsector;  (iii) protecting  debtor\u2019s  assets  (against  insider  and  fraudulent  transactions);\n(iv) facilitating the foreclosure on collateral by secured creditors; and (v) accelerating out-of-\ncourt settlements with the consent of at least 50 percent of unsecured creditors, representing no\nless than two-thirds of outstanding claims. Debtors and creditors failing to reach out-of-court\nworkout settlements under JITF, or to get the requisite creditor support for the workout plan, can\nresort to the commercial court to bind hold-out creditors,26 impose strict guidelines on the\nnegotiating process, or achieve liquidation of the company. However, public confidence in the\ncommercial courts is still low, since they do not function efficiently or address problems of\nfinancially  distressed  companies.  As  such,  they  do  not  yet  provide  adequate  support  for\ncorporate restructuring being pursued under JITF.\n4.  Labor Redundancies\n42. As mentioned in para. 38, SOEs need to reduce employment by 10 to 20 percent.\nSupport for SOEs to finance labor retrenchment and training will improve their prospects for\nsuccessful restructuring and privatization. Such retrenchment will be guided by Indonesia\u2019s\nlabor laws, which are of high standard. In 1998, Indonesia signed an LOI with the International\nLabour Organization (ILO) for the ratification of ILO's seven core conventions. These include\nfreedom of association, and freedom from forced labor, discrimination, and child labor. As of\nJanuary  2000,  Indonesia  is  the  only  country  in  Asia  to  have  ratified  all  the  seven  core\nconventions. A tripartite task force consisting of unions, the Government, and employers has\nbeen established and is working with ILO in the implementation of labor standards.27 The\nratification of ILO Convention 87 regarding the right of association has enabled SOE employees\nto join a union or engage in collective labor arrangements, though procedures for resolution of\nlabor disputes still have to be clarified. During the past 24 months, 102 labor unions have\nregistered or are in the process of registering with Ministry of Manpower (MOM). If no union\nexists, an association with an elected spokesperson can represent employees to management.\n43. The threat of unemployment because of liquidation, privatization, and restructuring of\nSOEs is a matter of concern to all employees due to uncertainties about settlement of their\nseverance claims and the prospect of privatization in general. Since 1997, 10 SOEs have\n                                                          \n26The court can force creditors delaying a restructuring agreement to accept it if a qualified majority of creditors\nagree on it.\n27 Three draft laws are currently waiting for processing by Parliament: (i) trade unions law, (ii) dispute settlement law,\nand (iii) manpower development law.", "14\ndownsized through voluntary settlement of employment termination. Among these, Indonesia\nAerospace Industries (IPTN) laid off 3,780 workers and Garuda Indonesia laid off 1,600. The\nlabor rationalization took place in consultation with employees through elected representatives\nrather  than  union  leaders,  and  the  process  was  completed  with  minimal  labor  disruption.\nEmployees  were  offered  severance  payments  25-40 percent  higher  than  prescribed  in  the\nPresidential Decree No. 3 of 1996. Under the regulation, employees are entitled to mandatory\ncompensation28  including  severance  pay,  service  benefit,  and  other  compensation  on  the\nfollowing scale:\nTable 3: Mandatory Severance Compensation\nSeverance Pay Months Pay Service Benefit Months Pay\nLess than 1 year 1 5-10 years 2\n1-2 years 2 10-15 years 3\n2-3 years 3 15-20 years 4\n3-4 years 4 20-25 years 5\nMore than 4 years 5 more than 25 years 6\nIn the cases of (i) company closure and (ii) change of ownership with employees refusing to\ncontinue working, the following mandatory compensation applies: severance pay plus service\nbenefit plus other compensation. In the cases of (iii) mass termination caused by efficiency\nmeasures  and  other  non-worker  related  reasons,  and  (iv) change  of  ownership  with  the\ncompany unwilling to reemploy the employees, the following compensation is mandatory, two\ntimes severance pay plus service benefit plus other compensation. The generous settlements\nbeing offered have been welcomed by employees and their representatives, a large number of\nthem continue to be concerned about their employment prospects under the reform program.\nThe anxiety about employment prospects is particularly strong among contract laborers, who do\nnot  enjoy  the  same  protection  as  regular  workers.  While  there  are  examples  of  amicable\nresolution of labor retrenchment issues, there is no certainty about the application of these\npractices in future cases, or these practices are not generally known. This is to be dealt with by\nMSOE through strengthening public relations and establishment of a consultative process to\nimprove information dissemination.\n5.  Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism (KKN)\n44. KKN  is  attributable  to  lack  of  transparency,  availability  of  privileges  linked  to\nconnections, and inadequate action against malpractices. In December 1998, the Government\ndisclosed that financial losses arising from KKN across ministries during the past 32 years had\nexceeded Rp2.9 trillion ($0.4-1.0 billion, depending on the exchange rate used). In July 1999,\nthe Government disclosed an additional Rp7.2 trillion of financial losses due to KKN in ministries\nand SOEs. After investigation, the Government in 1999 ordered the cancellation of 79 projects,\nrebidding of 25 projects, reauditing of 59 projects, and renegotiation of 10 projects. In view of\nrising public pressure, the Government has carried out special audits for Pertamina, Bulog,\nPLN,  and  the  Reforestation  Fund,  and  made  their  main  findings  public.  KKN  in  SOEs  is\nconcentrated in procurement. This area was a key focus in the last round of special enterprise\naudits conducted by international auditors and completed in June 2000 but not yet published.\nSelected enterprises include the national airline, the national toll road operator, the domestic\ntelecommunications company, public port corporations, and major plantation companies.\n                                                          \n28The category other compensation includes compensation includes compensation for remaining annual leave and\nlong service leave, compensation for repatriation, compensation for medical insurance, and compensation for\nhousing facilities. They are determined on a base by case basis.", "15\n45. At  a  more  general  level  of  governance,  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  corruption\ninvolve  (i)  improving  access  to  markets,  (ii)  legal  reform,  and  (iii)  strengthening  public\nadministration.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in  developing  its  governance  and\nanticorruption strategy.29 A high-level policy seminar was held in Jakarta in July 1999 under\nADB sponsorship to raise stakeholder awareness on this issue. An anticorruption law was\nenacted in April 1999 providing disclosure standards for public employees and mandating the\nestablishment of an independent anticorruption body within two years. An additional antibribery\nlaw was passed by Parliament in July 1999 mandating criminal sanctions for corruption. Since\nearly  2000  ADB  has  been  cooperating  with  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\n(UNDP), World Bank, and the Government in a \u201cPartnership for Governance,\u201d which puts a\nstrong emphasis on supporting the Government\u2019s fight against corruption.\nC.  Government Expenditure\n46. During the 1990s, SOEs were unable to generate sufficient profit to finance expansion.\nConsequently, they ended up borrowing excessively or establishing joint ventures. Many SOEs\nbecame  high-cost  producers  of  products  and  services  as  they,  under  political  pressure,\nparticipated in nonviable ventures or served the Government's social and employment goals.\nFor example, many SOEs were forced to take shareholding in toll road projects designed by the\nnational toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga. Similarly, many SOEs ended up with shareholding in\nthe national aircraft manufacturer PT IPTN, and were forced to carry the burden of successive\ncapital restructurings. SOE performance was affected by lack of clarity about objectives, weak\nincentive structures, and soft budget constraints that enabled financing of their losses and\ncapital outlay. While quantification of the level of transfers and subsidies from the Government\nbudget is difficult, a World Bank study30 for 22 SOEs suggests that equity contributions and loan\nforgiveness amounted to $1.5 billion (Rp3.0 trillion), and price support to $1.8 billion (Rp3.5\ntrillion),  compared  to  dividends  of  $420  million  (Rp854 billion)  in  1996.  Given  ineffective\ngovernance  mechanisms,  SOEs  largely  operated  without  proper  accountability  and\ntransparency  as  well  as  financial  discipline.  Accounting  practices  did  not  allow  reliable\nmonitoring  of  management  and  enterprise  performance,  and  encouraged  widespread\nirregularities, making it difficult to assess the value for the shareholder.\n47. SOEs will continue to burden the budget through the exchange rate risks associated with\nthe two-step offshore foreign currency loans raised by them during the 1990s. The SOEs repay\nthese obligations, including the interest payments, to the Government in local currency at the\nexchange rates prevailing on the drawdown dates. There are no consolidated records of the\nsize and composition of such two-steps foreign currency loans, which are administered by MOF.\nADB  provided  a  TA  to  MOF  to  assess  its  loan  portfolio  and  establish  a  unit  for  its  risk\nmanagement.31 Liabilities of exchange risk coverage on these two-step foreign currency loans\nare huge. Preliminary estimates are about $20 billion. As an example, future obligations of PT\nTelkom\u2019s two-step loans amount to Rp27 trillion, or close to $3 billion at the current exchange\nrate. If PT Telkom had borne the exchange rate risk since 1998, over half of its shareholders\u2019\nfunds and its entire profit would have been wiped out.\n                                                          \n29 TA 3381-INO: Establishment of an Anticorruption Commission, for $1,000,000, approved on 28 December 1999.\nTA 3474-INO: A Governance Audit of the Public Prosecution Service, for $1,000,000, approved on 21 July 2000.\n30 World Bank, 1998.

Government Objectives and Strategy\n48. Despite the significant fiscal costs of operating SOEs in various sectors, the Government\nmade only limited attempts to reform and privatized SOEs in the 1990s. The first phase of\nprivatization implemented between October 1994 and December 1996 preceded the economic\ncrisis. It involved the sale of minority stakes, ranging from 10 percent to 35 percent, in six of\nIndonesia\u2019s  largest  SOEs  on  domestic  and  international  capital  markets.32  The  divestment\nraised close to $4.3 billion. MOF held the nominal ownership of SOEs and, in principle, was\nsupposed to exercise its control rights by setting up specific performance targets for SOE\noperations and issuing guidelines for dividends. In practice, the power of SOE management,\nadministration, and supervision rested with the sector ministries. This institutional arrangement\nin  effect  confounded  the  actual  property  rights  over  SOEs  between  MOF  and  the  sector\nministries. The sector ministries frequently interfered in the commercial operations of SOEs and\nexerted considerable power of informal property rights due to personal allegiance, subsidization,\nand outright corruption, cronyism, and nepotism.\n49. The second phase of SOE reforms, induced by the crisis, started in early 1998 when the\nGovernment changed the institutional arrangement for the oversight of SOEs. As a first step,\nPresidential  Decree  Nos.  12  and  13 of  1998  transferred  the  power  of  SOE  management,\nadministration, and supervision from the sector ministries back to MOF. SOEs were delinked\nfrom the purview of sector ministries to remove the latter\u2019s interference in SOEs\u2019 commercial\noperations and refocus sector ministries to their primary function of sector policy making and\nregulation. In the third phase, in May 1998, Presidential Decrees Nos. 50 and 64 were issued to\ntransfer the management responsibility of SOEs from MOF to the newly established MSOE, with\na view to providing them with increased managerial autonomy. In December 1999, 4 state-\nowned banks and 14 financial institutions were transferred from MSOE back to the MOF. To\nimprove Cabinet efficiency, MSOE was dissolved on 26 August 2000, and oversight over the\nSOEs was transferred to a directorate general for SOEs (DG BUMN) in MOF.33 On 10 August\n2001, MSOE was reinstated by President Megawati Sukarnoputri as a state ministry.\n50. These changes have streamlined institutional arrangements for SOEs. MOF continues to\noversee the financial aspects of SOEs, including share custody, financial audits, and receipt of\ndividends and revenues from the sale of shares. All other property rights are now exercised by\nMSOE:  (i)  dividend  payments;  (ii)  appointment  and  termination  of  contracts  of  SOE\ncommissioners and directors; (iii) merger, consolidation, sale, and liquidation of SOEs; and\n(iv) granting  of  Government  guarantees  for  SOE  debt.  However,  the  process  of  SOE\nrestructuring  and  privatization  will  continue  to  require  close  interdepartmental  coordination\nbetween MSOE and the sector ministries, particularly in PSO-related matters. The Government\nhas therefore established the minister-level Privatization Consultative Committee to coordinate\nthe reform process.\nE.  External Assistance to the Sector\n51. Since the onset of the economic crisis, donors have coordinated closely in Indonesia to\noversee the implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program and structural reforms\nacross critical sectors. Responding to the crisis, ADB approved the FGR:SDP (footnote 1) to\nhelp strengthen financial sector policies and regulatory framework, restructure and recapitalize\nbanks, and initiate a number of reforms of SOEs. In early 1999, ADB approved a program loan\n                                                          \n32PT Telkom, PT Indosat, PT Semen Gresik, PT Tambang Timah, PT Amka Tambang, and PT Bank Negara\nIndonesia.\n33 Refer to Presidential Decree No. 89 of 10 October 2000.", "17\nfor the power sector34 to help split up a major SOE, PLN, and privatize commercially viable\ncomponents. The program supports the Government\u2019s reform agenda and involves dismantling\nthe vertical monopoly in the power sector to increase private sector participation and to move\ntoward competitive markets for generation and distribution of electricity, with a single company\nresponsible for national transmission.\n52. With the financial and power sector restructuring under way, ADB has been coordinating\nwith other funding agencies, including IMF, to support revival of the real sector. The World Bank\nfinanced the preparation of a first SOE masterplan in 1999 and provided a loan35 that has\nsupported restructuring and partial privatization of a first group of 12 of the largest SOEs. While\nincluding selective policy measures for the SOE sector, the World Bank loan was primarily a\nbroad-based structural adjustment operation that covered improvements in macroeconomic\nmanagement, legal and regulatory framework for bank and corporate restructuring, governance,\ntransparency, efficiency, and social safety net for the poor across several sectors. Apart from\nthis  World  Bank  contribution,  ADB  is  the  only  institution  to  provide  support  for  structural\nadjustments in the difficult SOE sector.\n53.  ADB approved a TA in December 1998 (footnote 5) to develop governance structures for\nSOEs, implement a strategic planning system in MSOE, design privatization and restructuring\nprocedures, assess the legal framework for privatization, and prepare corporate restructuring\nand  privatization  plans  for  a  group  of  40  SOEs.  As  a  lead  funding  agency  in  corporate\ngovernance,  apart  from  helping  formulate  overall  structural  reforms  to  introduce  higher\nstandards of corporate governance among SOEs, ADB has been supporting specific efforts in\nthe  power  sector  (para.  51),  gas  transmission  industry,  insurance,  and  pension  funds.\nMeanwhile, the World Bank has been helping to open the telecommunications industry to the\nprivate sector and improve efficiency in the postal monopoly.\n54. During processing,36 ADB has closely coordinated with the IMF, whose LOI of 27 August\n2001 reconfirms the major elements of the proposed Program and includes provisions for\nmonitoring the progress in privatizing SOEs by setting targets for proceeds from their sale. ADB\nalso has an ongoing dialogue with Japanese authorities and has kept them informed about the\nprogress of the Program.\nF.  ADB's Operations and Strategy in Indonesia\n1.  Country Strategy\n55. ADB\u2019s new country operational strategy (2001-2004) for Indonesia, which was finalized\nin early 2001, focuses principally on reducing poverty and regional inequity, and is anchored in\ngood governance as the strategy recognizes its crucial importance in the Indonesian context.\nThe strategy has four principal areas of operational focus where assistance will have to be\n                                                          \n34Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $380 million, approved on 23 March 1999; and Loan\n1674-INO: Capacity Building for Establishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, approved on\n23 March 1999.\n35 Policy Reform Support Program for $500 million, approved in May 1999.\n36Processing of the proposed Program was suspended between August and December 1999, along similar action of\nIMF and the World Bank, due to the Bank Bali scandal and political uncertainty during the transition to a\ndemocratically elected government. All three institutions resumed operations in late 1999. IMF agreed on a new\nLOI in January 2000, covering a new three-year extended arrangement until December 2002. The previous\nextended arrangement from late 1997 was terminated. Only $10 billion out of $12 billion was used. The new\narrangement is for almost $5 billion, an enhancement of around $3 billion over the pervious arrangement.\nProcessing of the proposed Program was again suspended between May 2000 and September 2001 due to\npolitical uncertainty.", "18\nprogrammed: encouraging sustainable recovery and pro-poor growth, improving regional equity\nthrough  balanced  regional  development,  enhancing  human  and  social  development,  and\nmainstreaming environmental management to ensure sustainable use of natural resources.\n56. In view of the governance-related issues in the financial and corporate sectors that had\ncontributed to the financial crisis, support for improving financial and corporate governance in\norder to build up a more stable and resilient financial and corporate structure is a major element\nof the governance strategy for Indonesia. In the area of corporate governance, reform of the\nSOEs, which contribute a significant share to the overall GDP, is critical. The crisis had exposed\nserious weaknesses in the functioning of SOEs, much of it governance related; thus, improving\ntheir functioning and privatizing them is a priority.\n57. The poor performance of SOEs is also a major factor contributing to the fiscal weakness\nof the public sector and impeding economic recovery in general. Improving their performance\nand assisting their privatization is thus also consistent with the focus in the country operational\nstrategy on encouraging sustainable recovery. The program of SOE privatization is also a key\nelement of the Government\u2019s structural adjustment program supported by IMF\u2019s current $5\nbillion three year extended fund facility. On 27 August 2001, the new Government signed an LOI\nwith IMF that allowed a release of a $400 million tranche from the Facility. This tranche had\nbeen delayed since December 2000 owing to lack of progress on reforms and its release\nsignals that the IMF reform program is back on track.\n2.  Sector Strategy\n58. ADB's operational strategy for SOEs supports fostering competition and establishing a\ntransparent and predictable policy regime across the trade, industry, and financial sectors.\nOverleveraging and exposure to unhedged foreign currency liabilities have resulted in a severe\nfinancial crisis. With extensive support from external funding agencies, including ADB, the\nGovernment has moved to strengthen financial sector governance standards, restructure the\nsector, and improve its viability through consolidation and recapitalization. In addition, ADB is\nhelping, with a recent program (footnote 3), to streamline and rationalize the industrial policy\nand regulatory framework so that both public and private enterprises, particularly small- and\nmedium-sized enterprises, develop in an open and competitive environment to support higher\nand sustainable economic growth.\n59. While industrial deregulation and liberalization is in progress, the SOE sector, which is\nan important segment of the economy, needs a program focused at comprehensive corporate\nrestructuring. ADB assistance in the first phase has involved targeting SOE reforms as a part of\nthe FGR:SDP. This program has focused on (i) enactment of anticorruption legislation; (ii) study\nof private provision of public services, their pricing, costs, and benefits; (iii) performance audit by\nthe Finance and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP) of selected SOEs and special state\nagencies, and capacity-building programs to raise the quality of public sector auditors and\ninspector generals of ministries; and (iv) issuance of regulations requiring increased disclosure\nin audited financial statements of SOEs and a decree on the mandatory publication of SOE\naudit reports. Progress has been made in all these areas, but delays have been experienced in\nsome policy actions because of changes in institutional arrangements.\n60. In December 1998, ADB sponsored a substantial study on corporate governance in\nIndonesia  (footnote  5).  The  study  revealed  major  weaknesses  of  the  precrisis  corporate\ngovernance  regime  and  highlighted  improvements  achieved  in  1998.  While  the  legislative\nframework for corporate governance is mostly in place, compliance and enforcement are the\nmajor concerns. ADB's strategy is to support strengthening of corporate governance in key", "19\nsegments of the economy. Just as the FGR:SDP has improved governance in the financial\nsector, the proposed Program will establish improved governance practices in the SOE sector\nby enforcing rules and regulations and addressing special agency problems through contractual\narrangements. In the process, the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework for improving\ngovernance standards in private companies will also be strengthened by transferring experience\ngained under the Program. ADB, along with other agencies, is supporting NCCG (footnote 4) to\nbetter  define  its  role  and  functions  and  to  help  encourage  development  of  structures  and\nmechanism to improve corporate governance in the private sector.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n61. Though established to serve both economic and social goals, SOEs have been an\ninefficient  supplier  of  both  public  and  private  services  and  goods.  The  provision  of  social\nservices and contribution to regional development objectives have largely been achieved at\na considerable cost to society. Inefficiencies arose because of indiscriminate subsidization and\nprotection of SOEs without due regard for economic viability and competitiveness. Moreover,\nSOEs have been exploited for the benefit of individuals and associated interests, accompanied\nby  growing  corruption  and  collusion  or  outright  fraud.  This  neglect  of  governance  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s sphere of direct influence has encouraged lax governance in the private sector,\nto the detriment of creditors and minority shareholders.\n62. SOE performance in Indonesia has been affected by:\n(i)  weak corporate governance such as Government interference, poor internal\ncontrols, loopholes in accounting practices, and weak auditing standards and\npractices;\n(ii)  lax supervision and insufficient accountability that have distorted performance\nincentives for supervisors and staff;\n(iii)  weak enforcement of commercial laws and regulations;\n(iv)  ill-conceived market protection and administered price controls; and\n(v)  ineffective SOE management.\n63. The SOE reliance on two-step foreign currency loans that they received in local currency\nhas significant long-term budgetary implications (see para. 47). Under the standard onlending\narrangements, the Government carries the full exchange rate risk on both interest and principal\nfor SOEs\u2019 borrowings. Preliminary estimates suggest that in the next 10 years these costs will\namount to over $20 billion, possibly higher than the total sale value of SOEs. The persistent\nsubsidization of SOEs\u2019 products and services, their excessive reliance on government funding,\nand their wasteful spending because of lack of accountability have added to the financial burden\nof  SOEs.  Furthermore,  SOEs\u2019  inefficiencies  have  held  back  growth  of  quality  service.  For\nexample, PT Telkom is unable to expand its infrastructure to cater for increasing demand. Given\nits restricted access to equity, it cannot pursue investment opportunities, even if substantially\nleveraged. PT Telkom\u2019s investment in a number of leveraged joint ventures has constrained its\nfurther growth. Similarly, PT Jasa Marga launched a number of leveraged joint venture build-\nown-transfer toll road projects that are now in serious financial difficulty.\n64. Overall, the costs of holding on to the portfolio of SOEs are significant: (i) the opportunity\ncost of capital invested in SOEs (see footnote 17) amounted to $3.7 billion (Rp37 trillion) in\n2000 (Rp23 trillion is attributable to the national electric company PT PLN alone). These will\ndecline to about $2.5 billion (Rp25 trillion) in 2002, and are expected to remain at that level in", "20\nthe  foreseeable  future;  (ii)  the  past  practice  of  exchange  rate  risk  being  borne  by  the\nGovernment under two-step loans will burden the state budget with at least $1.1 billion (Rp11\ntrillion) per year during the next decade; and (iii) the direct costs of delayed interest payments\nfor loans from MOF to individual SOEs is estimated to amount to $300 million (Rp3 trillion)\nannually. The aggregate cost of (i), (ii), and (iii) is $3.9 billion (Rp39 trillion), equivalent to four\ntimes  the  expenditure  for  housing  and  human  settlement,  five  times  the  expenditure  for\neducation, and eight times the health expenditure. It does not yet include future debt-to-equity\nswaps, loan foregiveness in the context of IBRA debt restructurings, and losses from SOE\nliquidations, which may occur in any year.\n65. Despite protection, subsidies, and guaranteed access to foreign lending, investments in\nSOEs have yielded poor returns. The rupiah depreciation did improve the financial position of\nSOEs only marginally due to increases in debt servicing costs, a drop in domestic demand,\nincreases  in  the  cost  of  imported  raw  materials,  and  tightening  of  credit  availability.  The\neconomic crisis also severely affected the profitability of most SOEs and wiped out their equity.\nWhile subsidization of SOEs has been scaled down due to fiscal pressures, many SOEs have\nraised additional debt or stopped servicing their debt obligations to cover operational losses and\nmeet day-to-day obligations. This avoids tough decisions in the near-term, but raises the long-\nterm cost of SOE reform considerably and complicates the process of debt resolution, which is\ncritical to maintain momentum of the banking sector reforms.\n66. The  growing  distress  of  SOEs  and  the  need  to  address  fundamental  structural\ndistortions of the economy exposed during the economic crisis have brought to the forefront the\nurgency of SOE reforms. The Program focuses on strengthening SOE governance with the\nobjective  of  their  restructuring  and  eventual  privatization.  The  Government  has  started  to\nenforce higher corporate governance standards in the commercial enterprises under its direct\ncontrol, while reforming the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for inducing greater\ncompetition  and  market  orientation  across  sectors.  This  holistic  approach  to  corporate\ngovernance will also help introduce and enforce best corporate governance practices in the\nprivate  economy  and  provide  the  incentives  for  sound  investments.  It  will  also  improve\nprospects for the privatization of profitable SOEs and support restructuring of ailing SOEs,\nthereby  reducing  the  financial  risk  in  the  Government\u2019s  SOE  portfolio.  Sole  emphasis  on\ncorporate restructuring or privatization of SOEs without improvements in corporate governance\nis not feasible, as the restructured or privatized enterprises are not likely to reach sustainable\nprofitability or attract domestic and foreign investors. Improved profitability in the state sector\nand corporate restructuring of SOEs will reinforce the ongoing bank sector restructuring.\n67. Recognizing this, the Government has adopted privatization of SOEs as a key strategy\nto  enhance  economic  liberalization  and  generate  revenues  for  debt  repayments  and  bank\nrecapitalization. However, poor planning, weak public relations, and opposition from vested\npolitical and bureaucratic interests have delayed the privatization process. MSOE, established\nin 1998, took some time to develop its own capacity and a final and comprehensive masterplan\nfor  the  SOE  reforms  was  only  announced  in  June  2000.  To  support  this  masterplan,  the\nProgram  aims  to  introduce  corporate  governance  mechanisms  that  align  management\nincentives  with  shareholder  objectives  and  interests,  separate  PSOs  from  commercial\noperations of SOEs, and enforce SOEs\u2019 compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. These\nmeasures will facilitate financial and operational restructuring of viable SOEs and liquidation of\nnonviable  ones,  while  generating  momentum  for  privatization  of  commercially  successful\nenterprises. To support this process, the Program also calls for adopting a human resource\ndevelopment policy guaranteeing fair treatment of redundant employees, thereby accelerating\nlabor  restructuring  and  eliminating  or  reducing  opportunities  for  KKN,  particularly  in  the\nprocurement process.", "21\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n68. The proposed Program will improve resource allocation in the public sector, increase\nprofitability of Indonesia\u2019s SOEs, and promote private sector participation in the commercial\nactivities of SOEs. Reform of SOEs, involving transfer of ownership and management, and\nconfining the Government\u2019s role to policymaking and regulation, will release scarce resources\nfor poverty reduction and social programs. This will be achieved by\n(i)  subjecting SOEs to sound corporate governance practices;\n(ii)  separating commercial activities of SOEs from their PSOs;\n(iii)  restructuring and privatizing SOEs;\n(iv)  establishing fair and transparent procedures for managing labor redundancies;\nand\n(v)  strengthening and effectively enforcing guidelines for procurement in SOEs.\n69. The  proposed  Program  will  concentrate  on  restructuring  of  SOEs  incorporated  as\ncompanies with limited liability (perseros) under the authority of MSOE. It excludes banks and\nfinancial institutions that are being restructured under the FGR:SDP and other programs, and\nutilities such as the electricity supplier (PT PLN), natural gas transmitter (PT PGN), postal\nmonopoly (PT Pos), and toll road operator (PT Jasa Marga) that are supported under separate\nADB or World Bank loans and TAs.\n70. The proposed Program will be implemented over the next three years, targeting reforms\nin selected subsets of the SOE portfolio held by MSOE (for details, see Appendix 3) by\n(i)  introducing the new corporate governance standards and practices in 88 SOEs\nthat are not to be privatized in the next 3 years,\n(ii)  commercializing PSOs in selected SOEs where such obligations have been\nidentified,\n(iii)  restructuring  the  finances  and  operations  of  30  SOEs  that  are  suitable\ncandidates for rapid improvement and subsequent divestment,\n(iv)  privatizing  15  SOEs  where  access  to  equity  capital  and/or  management\nexpertise will improve prospects for profitability,\n(v)  selling the minority shareholding in 12 companies,\n(vi)  liquidating 8 unviable SOEs,\n(vii)  applying the labor retrenchment policy  to all SOEs, and\n(viii)  auditing procurement and procurement practices in 40 randomly selected SOEs.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n71. The policy framework and actions that have been agreed with the Government are\ndescribed in detail in the development policy letter and the attached policy matrix (Appendix 1).\nThe major actions are outlined here.\n1.  Corporate Governance\n72. The  introduction  of  sound  corporate  governance  standards  and  practices  involves\nsetting in place a set of structures, procedures, and incentives, that empower managers to\ncreate shareholder value under adequate supervision, in a transparent environment, and with\nadequate accountability. This includes contractual arrangements to improve accountability and\ntransparency,  as  well  as  enforcement  of  commercial  laws,  standards,  and  regulations.\nAccountability  will  be  established  through  standardized  and  formalized  contractual", "22\narrangements, which involve the Government agreeing on statements of corporate intent (SCIs)\nand entering into appointment agreements with commissioners and directors of SOEs. For\nSOEs listed on JSE, the Program prescribes the rigorous application of JSE listing rules (para.\n77) thereby giving priority to the protection of minority shareholders.\n73. The Program calls for the implementation of SCIs for at least 88 SOEs. Going beyond\nthe financial and corporate information required in the annual report of a listed company, the\nSCI provides specific and strategic directions to the BOD. The SCI defines the (i) objectives and\nscope of SOE activities; (ii) business and corporate restructuring plan and an assessment of\ncost and savings; (iii) accounting policies; (iv) performance targets in relation to prescribed\nobjectives;  (v) information  requirements  of  the  shareholding  ministry;  (vi)  compliance  with\nenvironmental legislation to be confirmed through certification by accredited agency (e.g., ISO\n14000); (vii) employment status of staff and compliance with laws and regulations regarding\nlabor relations; (viii) procedures to be followed for acquisition or sale of shares and divestment\nof  subsidiaries;  (ix) compensation  for  SOE  activities  from  the  public  sector,  if  any;  and\n(x) procedures for financial valuation of SOEs. SCIs will help alleviate the problem associated\nwith management expanding or reducing SOE activities without the appropriate mandate.\n74. In  conjunction  with  SCIs,  the  Government  as  shareholder  will  enter  into  formal\nappointment  agreements  with  all  newly  appointed  commissioners  and  directors.  These\ncontractual arrangements can be documented in the minutes of the shareholder meeting. The\nGovernment has announced the appointment criteria, roles, responsibilities, and accountability\nof  BOCs  and  BODs.37  The  appointment  agreements  will  foster  autonomy  of  SOEs  and\naccountability of supervisors and management by establishing individual and collective roles\nand responsibilities for implementing the SCI. In addition, MSOE will review and comment on\nthe composition of the BOCs and BODs, including the number of members, and their skills mix\nand qualifications.38 A new performance incentive system will be introduced for all SOEs to\nreward management and staff for improvements in defined performance indicators.\n75.      For a rigorous system of accountability to work, MSOE officials and SOE commissioners\nand directors must be highly qualified professionals. Therefore, with ADB support (footnote 5),\ntraining has been provided, in effective corporate governance mechanisms and will continue\nunder a new TA (footnote 6). So far, 60 officials and SOE management and staff have received\nthis training and another 120 will be trained by 2002. MSOE will review the performance of the\nfirst group of SOEs that have received the training and implemented SCIs and appointment\nagreements for at least one year.\n76. In  addition  to  establishing  clear  accountability,  the  Program  will  radically  improve\ntransparency  and  disclosure  of  financial  accounts  of  SOEs.  Corporate  secretaries  will  be\nresponsible for providing mandated corporate information to the public. The Government will\nenforce  strict  application  of  accounting  standards  by  SOEs  in  accordance  with  an  agreed\ntimetable. A total of 78 SOEs will be subjected to independent (non-BPKP) three-year financial\naudits.  In  addition,  it  will  encourage  rigorous  application  and  enforcement  of  disclosure\nstandards  recently  prescribed  by  the  Government.  Sound  disclosure  standards,  uniform\napplication of Indonesian GAAP for the preparation of annual reports under the supervision of\naudit committees at the BOC level, and submission of such reports in accordance with legal\nrequirements will enhance transparency and improve governance.\n                                                          \n37 Decree of the Minister of Finance No. 146/KMK.05/2001\n38The review will include the role, obligations and composition of BOC and BOD to verify whether BOC has guided\nand monitored the implementation by BOD of (i) SOE\u2019s long-term plan, (ii) annual business plan, and (iii) budget.", "23\n77. The Program recognizes the important role of listed SOEs for improving the quality of\ncorporate governance in Indonesia\u2019s private sector. MSOE will ensure that listed SOEs will\nmove to comply with the listing rules of JSE, in particular with the following provisions on\ncorporate governance:\n(i)  appointment  of  independent  commissioners  in  proportion  to  the  number  of\nshares held by noncontrolling shareholders;\n(ii)  establishment of an audit committee comprising at least three members, one of\nwhom is an independent commissioner and the others independent professionals\nin accounting and/or finance recruited from outside the company; and\n(iii)  appointment of a corporate secretary, who must be a member of the BOD or a\ncorporate officer specifically appointed to this function.\n2.  Public Service Obligations\n78. The Program supports the separation of PSOs from the purely commercial activities of\nSOEs. To this end, MSOE will (i) identify PSOs in all SOEs; (ii) quantify the monetary value of\nperforming PSOs in 15 SOEs; (iii) develop rules and regulations for contracting such services\non  a  competitive  bidding  basis,  allowing  participation  by  private  companies;  and  (iv)\ncommercialize PSOs in selected SOEs. The objective is to establish a transparent process for\nthe separation of PSOs with due consultation of all stakeholders. A precondition for carrying out\n(ii) is the introduction of cost accounting in the concerned SOEs. This helps to quantify the costs\nof providing PSOs, and will allow to estimate the value of the commercial operations of SOEs,\nthus facilitating the privatization process.\n79. MSOE will cooperate closely with relevant sector ministries to introduce these rules and\nregulations, and support the contracting out of selected PSOs to the most competitive bidder,\nwhich may not necessarily be the SOE that had previously been providing the services. The\ncontracting process will give due consideration to compliance with social and environmental\nlegislation in technical specifications. ADB is supporting these reforms with TA (footnote 7).\n80. International experience has demonstrated that PSOs can be most efficiently provided\nwhen a competitive environment exists. This requires quantification and packaging of PSOs as\nconcessions or service contracts and offering them in public tender to the most competitive\nbidder. Such a contracting process will allow the Government to accurately measure the cost of\nPSOs and ensure that their provision is contracted to the most efficient supplier. This will\nfacilitate  the  creation  of  a  transparent  system  of  (i)  subsidies  for  socially  desirable,  but\neconomically nonviable services whose cost can be fully quantified and financed explicitly from\nthe Government budget; and (ii) bidding for the provision of such services by private companies\nthrough predefined and transparent rules and procedures.\n81. The  Government  has  identified  15  SOEs  with  significant  PSOs.  Among  them  are\nIndonesia\u2019s ports, which are operated by four SOEs, each of which has one potentially profitable\nport combined with 8 to 15 smaller regional ports that operate with losses. Similarly, all airports\nare operated by either of two SOEs, with one profitable international airport each (Jakarta and\nDenpasar) and several loss-making regional airports. Privatization options for these 6 SOEs are\nto sell them entirely, which involves the risk that the new owners might close the losing regional\noperations later, with unacceptable political and socioeconomic consequences. Another option,\ncurrently pursued by the Government for the airports and already applied to the container\nterminals of the Jakarta and Surabaya seaports, is to separate the profitable operations from the\nSOE and sell them to private operators or form joint ventures with private investors to operate\nthem separately. This option has the risk that the SOEs will no longer generate sufficient profits", "24\nto cross-subsidize the loss making ports and airports. A third possibility, to be pursued under the\nproposed Program, is to separate the non-profitable operations, which are in most cases PSOs,\nfrom  the  commercial  operations,  and  find  alternative  delivery  systems  for  them,  including\ntransparent subsidization. The commercial operations can thus be sold without endangering the\nfuture provision of PSOs.\n3. Corporate Restructuring and Privatization\n82. Given the size and complexity of SOE restructuring, the Program, together with the ADB\nfinanced TA (footnote 6) applies a common analytical framework39 that (i) prescribes guidelines\nfor  assessing  the  financial  and  commercial  viability  of  SOEs,  (ii) develops  a  financial  and\noperational  restructuring  strategy  for  SOEs  with  feasible  options  for  privatization,  and  (iii)\ndetermines financial and economic costs associated with the restructuring. Based on the work\nalready undertaken by the Government, the Program calls for (i) financial and operational\nrestructuring of 30 SOEs to prepare them for privatization, (ii) privatization of 15 SOEs, (iii) sale\nof the minority shareholding in 12 companies, and (iv) initiation of liquidation of 8 nonviable\nSOEs.\n83. In contrast to this new approach, which is based on analysis and strategy, the first\nprivatization attempts in 1998 and 1999 were of an ad-hoc nature, focusing predominantly on\nfiscal considerations. The Government planned to restructure and partially privatize 12 of the\nlargest SOEs in the telecommunications, mining, cement, airport and seaport, toll road, steel,\nand plantation sectors, and to divest one minority shareholding, PT Indofood, in the first round\nbetween May 1998 and March 2000. Privatization of these large infrastructure SOEs was part of\nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Policy  Reform  Support  Program  (footnote  35).  However,  weak  market\nconditions,  the  complexity  of  various  industries,  inadequate  regulatory  structures  in\ninfrastructure sectors, and lack of experience prevented the Government from completing this\nfirst round by the end of March 2000.\n84. In recognition of these difficulties, the Government requested TA from ADB to put the\nprivatization program on a solid basis. With support of consultants under the ADB-financed TA\n(footnote 5), the Government has undertaken substantial analytical and legal background work\nto relaunch its SOE privatization and governance program. In December 1999, MSOE started to\nscreen all 117 SOEs and 21 minority shareholdings. By the end of February 2000, financial and\nbusiness plan reviews were completed for 43 SOEs and 12 minority shareholdings identified as\nprivatization targets. Based on this assessment, the quantitative targets for the Program have\nbeen developed (Appendix 3), and the Government documented its commitment by publishing\nthem in the form of a masterplan for SOE reform.\na. Corporate Restructuring\n85. The Program targets the corporate restructuring of at least 10 commercially viable SOEs\nby September 2002 and another 15 by September 2003. Financial restructuring of SOEs can\ninvolve (i) selling subsidiaries and/or surplus assets, (ii) equity injection from third parties, (iii)\nmergers of SOEs, and (iv) debt restructuring. Operational restructuring can involve changes in\n(i)  management  information  systems;  (ii)  production  and  logistics  planning;  (iii)  distribution\nnetwork; (iv) marketing strategy; (v) workforce number and composition; and (vi) organizational\nstructure. It can also involve separation of PSOs from commercial activities. The restructuring\nand eventual privatization of SOEs will be conducted in a transparent manner to attract private\nsector investors who can inject new capital in viable SOEs. MSOE will continue to develop the\n                                                          \n39 The analytical framework has been developed under a previous ADB financed TA (footnote 5).", "25\nrestructuring plans with the support of two new TAs (footnotes 6 and 7).  Where possible, the\nSCI will contain a time-bound action plan and targets for improving financial performance and\nimplementing the selected restructuring option for the given SOE. As SOEs should be able to\nattract  strategic  investors,  restructuring  will  commence  immediately  to  pave  the  way  for\nprivatization under the Program. If appropriate, MSOE will assist in improving their balance\nsheets through debt-equity swaps and similar measures, but will leave it to the private sector\ninvestors to finance new investment to expand or modernize production facilities. In the case of\nboth PT Indofarma and PT Biofarma, the proceeds from the initial public offerings remained with\nthe companies to finance modernization and expansion.\n86. Financial restructuring is expected to be facilitated by recently introduced legal reforms\nsuch as (i) removal of the Company Law restrictions on the conversion of debt to equity; (ii)\nremoval of tax disincentives for restructuring, such as the failure to recognize mergers as tax\nneutral events and limits on loss carry-forward provisions; and (iii) simplification of procedures\nfor debt restructuring of MOF, MOM, Ministry of Justice, Ministry for Industry and Trade, and\nInvestment Coordinating Board.\nb. Privatization\n87.  The Program targets satisfactory progress in the following two areas: (i) privatization40\nof 7 SOEs by March 2003 and another 8 SOEs by March 2004, and (ii) disposal of the minority\nshareholdings in 5 companies by March 2003 and a further 7 companies by March 2004. To\nensure smooth and transparent privatization, MSOE has developed an analytical framework and\nevaluation methods for SOE privatization under ADB-financed TA (footnote 5). MSOE has\nfurther reviewed the legal and regulatory environment, including the Tax Law and Land Law,\nand  prepared  procedures  for  the  various  privatization  options  such  as  IPO,\nemployee/management buy-out, strategic sale, and sale to an existing investor, as well as for\nliquidation. Together these provide MSOE with a sound legal and procedural base for SOE\nrestructuring and privatization.\n88. The ADB-financed TA (footnote 6) will assist MOF in selecting the best privatization\noption for the sale of the selected SOEs. The relative merits of each option will be weighed\nagainst  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  for  the  transaction,  which  may  include  maximizing\nrevenue; preserving employment; accessing new technologies, markets, and know-how; and\nsecuring investment commitments. In cases where the objective of the Government is to access\nnew technology/know-how and secure investment commitments, sale to a strategic investor will\nbe  the  most  appropriate  privatization  option.  Where  the  Government  seeks  to  maximize\nproceeds and foster the development of the domestic capital market, sale via IPO may be more\neffective. In all cases, the question of labor retrenchment will need to be addressed as a part of\ntransaction negotiations, because any obligations imposed on the investor to retain surplus\nlabor will depreciate the transaction value of the company. Once the privatization options have\nbeen defined and assessed for each SOE, MSOE will recommend the best sales strategy and\nan action plan and timetable for its implementation to the steering committee (para. 106). The\nrecommendation  will  be  supported  by  an  assessment  of  its  effectiveness  in  meeting  the\nGovernment\u2019s objectives for the transaction, as well as their financial, economic, and regulatory\nimplications. The implementation itself will be approved and supervised by an evaluation team\nat minister level.\n                                                          \n40Defined as a reduction in the Government\u2019s share in the voting shares of a company (held directly or indirectly) to\nless than 50 percent.", "26\nc.  Closure and Liquidation\n89. Under the Program, MSOE will provide a time-bound plan and initiate liquidation of 8\nnonviable SOEs by December 2002. The decision to close nonviable SOEs that are not of\nstrategic significance and had generated operating losses even before the 1997 financial crisis,\nwill be preceded by a thorough review. Generally, closure of SOEs will be considered if they (i)\nuse obsolete technology; (ii) lack competitive advantage; (iii) face declining demand and market\nfor products; (iv) have weak management; (v) had already performed poorly before the crisis,\nwith the result that their equity has been wiped out; (vi) would require a complete diversification\nand/or overhaul of plant, equipment, marketing strategies and management expertise to return\nto profitability; and (vii) would have a cost of rehabilitation exceeding the value of the potential\nproceeds from their privatization. Liquidation of such SOEs is the most cost efficient option.\n4. Labor Redundancies\n90. The restructuring and privatization of SOEs will entail a reduction in staffing, a process\nthat has already begun in some SOEs. According to preliminary estimates under ADB-financed\nTA (footnote 5), the level of overstaffing is about 10 percent. In most SOEs, management is\nreluctant  to  reduce  the  workforce,  particularly  skilled  workers  the  SOE  has  provided  with\nvocational  training.  However,  most  redundancies  will  be  low-skilled  workers.  In  some\nmanufacturing and agricultural SOEs, women could suffer disproportionally.\n91. The impact of corporate restructuring and privatization will differ from SOE to SOE. In\nquite a number of them, new ownership and management will lead to an expansion of activities,\nand the total workforce will increase in the longer term. Examples are the utility companies with\nrestricted access to capital markets under state ownership, plantations that will expand into\nprocessing, and companies in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Other enterprises,\nparticularly smaller ones, may be viable in the long run only with a permanently reduced\nworkforce. For some, liquidation will be the only recourse, and retrenched workers will have to\nseek employment elsewhere. The Program puts a strong emphasis on mitigating these negative\nconsequences. International experience shows that mass redundancies have to be treated\nindividually and that legal provisions can only serve as a framework for negotiations between\nmanagement and employees or their representatives. The latter have a right to full information\nand fair negotiations, which aim at creative solutions beyond severence payments to ease the\ntransition.  This  is  best  achieved  through  a  process  involving  the  provision  of  information\nfollowed  by  consultations  and  then  negotiations.  Appendix  4  gives  examples  of  recent\nretrenchment settlements and evolving best practices.\n92. The Program will support MSOE\u2019s efforts in developing a labor rationalization policy to\nensure fair treatment of redundant SOE employees by using the best practices developed in the\nSOE sector and compliance with the existing legal standards specified in Presidential Decree\n3/1996. MSOE, with assistance from ADB-financed TA (footnote 6), will ensure that adequate\ninformation  is  disseminated  to  employees  and  a  structured  process  of  consultation  and\nnegotiation is followed. For this purpose, MSOE will establish a consultative working group on\nlabor  redundancies,  with  representation  from  Government,  SOEs,  and  unions,  to  manage\nseminars and workshops on labor legislation,41 and foster dialogue between labor unions, SOE\nmanagement, and MSOE. The labor rationalization policy will cover (i) severance and service\npayments; (ii) early retirement; (iii) assistance in redeployment, training, or retraining of workers,\nand financing of entrepreneurial initiatives; and (iv) employee rights in accessing their claims\n                                                          \n41 Currently there are three new laws before Parliament, the Trade Union Act, Dispute Settlement Act, and Manpower\nDevelopment Act.", "27\nagainst pension funds. Within this policy framework, SOEs will submit their individual labor\nrationalization plans (including costs) to MOM for approval. MOM will maintain disbursement\nrecords of financial assistance provided by SOEs or by the Government through SOEs unable\nto meet the cost of redundancies, and will develop dispute procedures allowing employees to\nlodge complaints and initiate litigation where justified.\n5. Procurement\n93. The  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  campaign  through  the\napplication  and  enforcement  of  appropriate  rules  and  regulations  in  the  area  of  SOE\nprocurement. It will continue the precedents set by audits of Government business units agreed\nto under the IMF program. The first set of audits were conducted in the first half of 1999 for\nPertamina, PLN, Agency for National Logistics (BULOG), and the reforestation fund. A second\nseries of audits was started in January 2000 covering the national airline, port companies, the\ntelecommunication company, and others. SOEs\u2019 procurement is guided by Presidential Decree\n18/2000,  which  are  applicable  to  all  public  sector  projects  (and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s\nProcurement Guidelines).  MSOE  will  ensure  that  SOEs  follow  procurement  procedures  as\nprescribed by these public sector regulations. MSOE will (i) require compliance of SOEs with\ntransparent and fair procurement practices ensuring full accountability; (ii) undertake random\naudits of procurement in 40 SOEs, present audit reports to ADB, publish a summary of findings,\nand initiate measures to recover losses and prosecute culprits; and (iii) based on the results of\nthe random audits, improve the detailed procedures for the procurement by SOEs, differentiated\nby industry groups if necessary.\nD.  Economic, Social, and Environmental Issues\n1.  Economic Impact\n94. Indonesia is pursuing a structural adjustment program supported by ADB, IMF, and\nWorld  Bank,  which  covers  wide-ranging  economic  reforms  including  banking  sector\nrestructuring,  capital  market  development,  trade  liberalization,  industry  deregulation,  legal\nreform, state sector reform, and improvements in governance. The Program is an integral part\nof  this  overall  reform  agenda  as  it  introduces  and  enforces  sound  corporate  governance\npractices,  improves  the  enforcement  of  commercial  laws  and  regulations,  promotes  fair\ntreatment of redundant employees, reduces corruption in procurement by SOEs, and supports\nthe transformation of viable SOEs into modern and profitable companies.\n95. The Program will have a profound impact on the overall economy in five areas. First, by\nsetting  high  standards  in  corporate  governance,  human  resource  management,  and\nanticorruption measures, it will create a model to be emulated by the private sector. Second,\nthrough promoting best practices in debt restructuring, the Program will provide good examples\nfor the private corporate sector as well, and thereby support the work of IBRA and JITF. Third,\ncorporate restructuring of SOEs will result in the development of healthier enterprises, relieving\nthe burden on and risk for public sector finances and the banking sector, which is exposed to\nnonperforming loans to SOEs. Fourth, the proceeds from SOE privatization will benefit the\nbudget, providing funds for social projects, bank recapitalization, and debt service. Fifth, the\nprivatization of sound SOEs will attract foreign investors back to Indonesia and thereby help\nrestore international confidence.\n96. The economic impact of the Program will be monitored and assessed on the basis of\n(i) reports from SOEs to MOM on redundancy agreements with employees; (ii) procurement\naudit reports prepared by independent auditors; (iii) reports from MSOE on compliance with the", "28\ncorporate governance system; (iv) annual reports submitted by listed SOEs to JSE and by the\nother SOEs to MSOE and the Company Registrar; (v) reports from MOF on the progress of\nprivatization; and (vi) reports from the stock exchanges Jakarta and Surabaya on the success of\nIPOs of SOEs.\n2. Social Impact\n97. A detailed assessment of the Program\u2019s impact on poverty is given in Appendix 4. By\nimproving corporate governance and mitigating the impact of labor redundancies, the Program\nsupports two key pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: good governance and social\ndevelopment. Moreover, by increasing SOE efficiency and through privatization, the Program\nwill help mobilize additional fiscal resources and thereby facilitate allocation of additional public\nfunds for poverty reduction. The Program addresses also the third pillar of ADB\u2019s poverty\nreduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable economic growth. SOEs have been a drain on the\nbudget and a drag on economic growth. The inefficiency, corruption, and waste in many SOEs\nhave left the Government with insufficient resources to provide the requisite level and quality of\npublic services and to launch antipoverty programs. The Program will support the transparent\nuse of public funds and efficient delivery of public services. Their economic efficiency will be\nincreased  by  applying  a  range  of  tools  including  improved  management,  introduction  of\ncompetitive markets, public-private partnerships, and privatization.\n98. While the Program will facilitate the return to sustainable growth, it is likely to have an\nadverse social impact, at least in the short run, as SOE restructuring will result in redundant\nlabor. The 10 percent overstaffing in the SOE sector represents about 70,000 employees.\nSurplus labor exists both at the management level where firms have undergone mergers (such\nas in the plantation industry) and at lower levels where changes in technology have reduced the\nneed for low skill labor and necessitate a different skill mix. Most layoffs are likely to affect\nworkers with low level skills, who will be less likely to find equivalent employment in the formal\nsector. Legally mandated severance standards are adequate. Negotiated settlements tend to be\nin excess of these minimum standards. Compared to the private sector, SOE employees are at\na disadvantage in such negotiations, as prior to 1999 they were not allowed to unionize or\nengage in collective bargaining. As a result they have little practical experience in negotiating\ntheir interests with management. And, SOE management has had little experience in dialogue\nwith labor on employment and employment-related issues.\n99. The Program puts a strong emphasis on establishing a consultative working group on\nlabor redundancies (para. 92) comprising representatives of all stakeholders to develop the\nlabor rationalization policy for MSOE. The consultative working group will develop standards of\nbest  practices  in  negotiating  settlements,  serve  as  a  conduit  for  information  for  labor\nrepresentatives, and provide a forum for policy discussion regarding unresolved labor issues\nsuch as the treatment of contract labor.42 The Program thus provides a channel for workers and\ntheir representatives to participate more fully and in an informed way in a dialogue to ensure\ntheir  best  interest.  Similarly,  the  corporate  governance  measures  will  result  in  better\nmanagement and fairer treatment of labor and ultimately greater efficiency and returns to public\ninvestment, growth, and poverty reduction.\n100. The measures under the Program support strengthening the system for social protection\nin Indonesia. ADB, through a TA (footnote 6), will play a significant role in assisting MSOE to\ndevelop policies for a retrenchment process based on best practices evolving within the SOE\n                                                          \n42Public and private sector firms have used contract labor for routine and essential jobs. Labor regulations prohibit\nfirms from using contract labor for this purpose for longer than one year, a rule that is routinely ignored. Moreover,\nsome public sector firms such as the oil and gas industry have been exempt from this by ministerial decree.", "29\nsector  and  internationally.  This  will  help  (i)  ensure  that  workers  receive  an  equitable\ncompensation package, and (ii) resolve issues regarding entitlement to employer contribution to\npension funds, unfunded liabilities, payouts for SOEs with insufficient funds, potential burden on\npension  funds,  and  any  issues  that  may  arise  from  excessive  use  of  contract  labor.  The\nprocesses adopted by SOEs and agreements reached will provide examples for the private\nsector struggling to deal with its own retrenchment programs.\n3. Environmental Impact\n101. A detailed assessment of the Program\u2019s potential environmental impacts is given in\nAppendix 5. SOEs generally adhere to the Government's environmental regulations in their\noperations. The three mining companies, for example, have environment protection policies in\nplace,  which  are  rigorously  enforced.  These  policies  have  been  adopted  from  Australian\nstandards, and adherence to them is continuously monitored. PT Krakatau Steel and fertilizer\ncompanies  voluntarily  apply  pollution  control  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  The\nmanufacturing  companies  are  generally  certified  under  ISO  9000,  which  encourages  the\napplication of environmental standards in  production facilities and use of  efficient and clean\nproduction techniques. In some cases, SOEs are actively pursuing environmental protection\nand rehabilitation or are required to do so under PSOs. The fishing companies, for example,\nhave been assisting in the protection of marine reserves. The forestry companies support\nreforestation, forest rehabilitation, and the development of ecotourism opportunities.\n102. The TA for commercialization of PSOs (footnote 7) is designed to ensure continuing\nprovision of such beneficial environmental services in a cost efficient manner. The rules and\nregulations for contracting out such services will give due consideration to compliance with\nenvironmental  legislation  in  the  technical  specifications.  The  Program  does  not  envisage\ninvestments in additional production capacity. After privatization, the new owners may expand\nproduction,  which  may  widen  the  environmental  impact  of  the  existing  production  sites.\nHowever, any such new investment will have to comply with the existing legislation. During the\nfinancial and operational review of the SOEs, MSOE, with assistance from the ADB-financed\nconsultants, will recommend a special assessment of compliance with environmental legislation\nwhere  appropriate.  Furthermore,  in  any  privatization,  including  environmentally  sensitive\nenterprises,  the  Government  can  retain  the  so-called  golden  share,  which  will  allow  it  to\ninfluence  future  investment  decisions  or  to  enforce  environmental  regulations.  The  major\ninstrument  of  corporate  governance,  the  SCI,  will  require  all  SOEs  to  report  regularly  on\ncompliance  with  environmental  legislation,  and,  where  appropriate,  this  will  have  to  be\nconfirmed  through  appropriate  certification  by  an  accredited  agency.  Additionally,  the\nperformance incentive system can be used to improve environmental performance by basing it\non environmental indicators or achieving certification by an accredited agency. Finally, the new\nguidelines for procurement to be developed under the Program will include requirements for\ncompliance with environmental standards.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n103. A $400 million program loan is proposed from ADB's ordinary capital resources to\nsupport the Program as described in the development policy letter and the attached policy\nmatrix (Appendix 1). The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan will be utilized\nover a period of 3 years from the date of its effectiveness. The loan size has been determined\nby the complexity of the Program, its development impact, and the adjustment costs related to", "30\nthe structural reforms. The costs are conservatively estimated at  $800 million during the three-\nyear program implementation period and include\n(i )  costs for labor redundancies across SOEs that are not to be liquidated and that\nwill retrench about 10 percent of their current staff (about $170 million);43\n(ii )  unfunded pension fund liabilities of the redundant workforce to be laid off and\nemployees in companies to be liquidated or privatized (about $130 million);\n(ii i)  debt restructuring costs for up to 60 SOEs, including debt-for-equity swaps, and\nthe settlement of long-term foreign exchange debt (about $420 million); and\n(iv )  liquidation of 8 nonviable SOEs and settlement of their outstanding financial,\ntrade, and tax debts, and wage claims (about $80 million).\nThe adjustment costs significantly exceed the amount of the Program loan. The difference will\nbe financed by the Government partly out of the proceeds of privatization transactions.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n104. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of three years, an interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending\nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee\nwill be capitalized in the loan); conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the\nterms of draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines; and\nother terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB\nwith (i) reasons for Indonesia\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on\nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own\nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n105. MOF  will  act  as  the  Executing  Agency  to  coordinate  and  monitor  the  overall\nimplementation of the Program, and administer the utilization of loan proceeds. MSOE will be\nthe  Implementing  Agency  and  will  coordinate  with  other  agencies  as  required.  MSOE  will\nprovide quarterly reports on the progress of the Program.\n106. To monitor the progress, the Government will establish a high-level steering committee\nwith representation from MSOE (chairperson), MOF, the Coordinating Ministry for Economy\nAffairs, the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), and MOM. The committee\nwill review SOE restructuring and privatization strategies and endorse these or recommend\nchanges if required. The primary authority for approving the strategies will remain with MSOE.\nThe steering committee will conduct quarterly reviews of program implementation and will be\nsupported by a corporate governance and privatization working group established within MSOE\nto closely oversee the development and implementation of financial and corporate restructuring,\nprivatization,  and  the  new  corporate  governance  policy  in  the  targeted  SOEs,  as  well  as\nimplementation of TA (footnote 6). A separate working group will oversee the implementation of\nthe TA for commercialization of PSOs (footnote 7). The steering committee will be further\nsupported by a consultative working group on labor redundancies.\n                                                          \n43 Surplus labor of 10 percent in the SOE sector is equivalent to 70,000 people. Given an average wage of $186 per\nmonth and legal minimum requirements for severence payments (footnote 30), this is about $174 million. Taking\nrecent settlements of the SOEs PT Garuda (national airline) and PT IPTN (aircraft manufacturer) as a benchmark,\nthe cost may exceed $220 million. Applying the settlements reached between IBRA and the employees of closed\nbanks, the costs could even exceed $280 million.", "31\nD.  Procurement and Disbursements\n107. Upon effectiveness, ADB will have the right to withdraw from the loan account and pay\nitself, on behalf of the Government, the front-end fee charged on the loan in the amount of $4\nmillion. The proceeds of the balance of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange\ncosts of items produced in, and procured from, ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items\nspecified  in  Appendix  6  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources,\nincluding other loans made by ADB). The Government will certify that, if (i) the proceeds of the\nloan will finance imports already made, the value of eligible imports in the period concerned\nexceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) the loan proceeds are to finance goods\nto be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding year period is equal to\nor greater than the amount of the requested disbursement plus all other amounts expected to be\nwithdrawn from the loan during the succeeding one year. ADB will have the right to audit the\nuse of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\nE.  Counterpart Funds\n108. The Policy Matrix for the Program includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will\nbe used by the Government to finance the cost of such structural adjustments, as well as other\nactivities consistent with the Program.\nF.  Monitoring and Tranching\n109. The program period will be three years from December 2001 to December 2004. The\nloan will be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche of $150 million44 is expected to be\nmade  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  has  completed  all  first  tranche\nconditions prior to loan negotiations.\n110. The second tranche, amounting to $150 million, is expected to be released by July 2003,\non completing the following six actions:\n(i)  appointment agreements for all newly appointed directors and commissioners will\nhave been signed;\n(ii)  35 SOEs will have submitted SCIs to MSOE;\n(iii)  80 percent of SOEs will have filed annual reports complying fully with legal\ndisclosure  requirements  for  listed  companies  with  MSOE  and  the  Company\nRegistrar;\n(iv)  independent (non-BPKP) three-year financial audits for 30 SOEs will have been\nsubmitted to ADB;\n(v)  satisfactory progress will have been achieved in the\n(a)  privatization of 7 SOEs, and\n(b)  sale of Government shares in 5 minority shareholdings; and\n(vi)  reports of procurement audits of 20 randomly selected SOEs will have been\npresented to ADB.\n111. The third tranche, amounting to $100 million, is expected to be released by July 2004,\nupon completing the following six actions:\n                                                          \n44 Upon effectiveness, ADB will withdraw from the loan account and pay itself, on behalf of the Government, the front-\nend fee charged on the loan in the amount of $4 million.", "32\n(i)  appointment agreements will have been signed for all newly appointed directors\nand commissioners;\n(ii)  50 SOEs will have submitted SCIs to MSOE;\n(iii)  80 percent of SOEs will have filed annual reports complying fully with legal\ndisclosure  requirements  for  listed  companies  with  MSOE  and  the  Company\nRegistrar;\n(iv)  independent (non-BPKP) financial audits will have been submitted to ADB for 30\nSOEs;\n(v)  satisfactory progress will have been achieved in the\n(a)  privatization of 8 SOEs, and\n(b)  sale of Government shares in 7 minority shareholdings; and\n(vi)  reports of procurement audits of 20 randomly selected SOEs will have been\npresented to ADB.\n112. An  additional  26  monitorable  policy  actions  will  be  carried  out  during  the  program\nimplementation. Most of them are important steps toward achieving conditions for the release of\nthe second and third tranches.\n113. The steering committee will assess the implementation of the Program and, through\nMOF, provide ADB with quarterly reports on the progress in all five program areas, including the\nprogress in quantitative terms in conditions for the next tranche release. After receiving the\nsteering committee reports, ADB will send regular review missions to assess compliance with\nsuch conditions and advise on corrective actions required to keep the program implementation\non course. The Government will submit a program completion report to ADB at the end of the\nprogram period.\nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Program Benefits\n114. The proposed Program is an integral part of the Government's comprehensive efforts to\naddress the long-standing distortions in the Indonesian economy. Its central objective is to\nimprove resource allocation in the public sector by making SOEs efficient and profitable, thus\nallowing them to pay higher dividends and corporate taxes to the Government. These revenues,\ntogether  with  the  proceeds  from  the  privatization  of  SOEs,  will  help  alleviate  budgetary\npressures and allow the Government to meet priority expenditure on social programs and social\nsafety net.\n115. The  Program  prescribes  rigorous  corporate  governance  mechanisms,  based  on\ninternational best practices, and enforces legal and regulatory requirements to improve the\naccountability and transparency of SOEs. This will help the Government gain the necessary\nauthority to enforce better corporate governance throughout the corporate sector. Strengthened\ncorporate governance in SOEs will be reflected in improved transparency in dealings with\nshareholders, lenders, employees, and other stakeholders in listed companies. The listing of a\nnumber of SOEs on the JSE in the future will set good examples for observance of corporate\ngovernance, and will generate the necessary market pressure on other listed enterprises to\nimplement the same improvements.\n116. Corporate governance is not an issue of regulation, but one of enforcement. Of the\n288 companies listed on the JSE, 244 companies are majority owned by large conglomerates\nwith the attendant lack of transparency and absence of accountability to minority shareholders.\nTheir financial statements do not reflect the risk exposure as a part of the conglomerate and do", "33\nnot allow an assessment of the company's credit worthiness or of shareholder value. This has\ncontributed to a loss of confidence of international institutional investors in Indonesia. The listing\nof a large number of additional SOEs will increase the supply of quality securities on JSE and\nwill allow investors to make more informed decisions. This should enhance market discipline in\nJSE and reduce volatility in the equity market in the long run. A related benefit is that increased\ninvestor confidence will ease IBRA\u2019s task of disposing of a large part of its assets into the equity\nmarket.\nB.  Poverty Impact\n117. In the longer term, successful restructuring and privatization will increase job security for\nthe  employees  in  many  of  the  SOEs.  Without  Government  ownership,  and  resulting\nrelationships with state-owned banks, many of these companies would be bankrupt by now.\nHowever, with the new banking regulations now in place, these cozy relationships are about to\nend.  SOEs will now have to compete for credit as do their private sector counterparts. SOEs\nthat do not restructure are not likely to survive competition. A group of SOEs has been hit very\nhard by trade liberalization during the past years. In particular those active in manufacturing and\nprocessing of agricultural goods, such as sugar mills. Not only are they in a vulnerable financial\nposition, but are also not internationally competitive. Only rapid privatization, accompanied by\ninjection of capital and know how, can make them more competitive and improve their chances\nfor  survival.  The  Government  neither  has  the  capital  nor  the  capability  to  continue  their\noperation.\nC.  Program Risks\n118. The implementation of the Program can be affected by several factors. The principal\nrisk relates to political uncertainty and its effect on the pace of structural reforms. However,\nthere is a firm commitment to SOE reforms at the highest levels in the new Government, and\nconsequently, the risk of the Program being diluted or abandoned is limited.\n119. The second risk stems from the potential opposition of vested interests. For instance, all\nmembers of BOCs of SOEs are public servants\u2014many with limited relevant skills\u2014for whom\nthe monetary and fringe benefits of the position provide a source of considerable income.\nCorporate restructuring and the subsequent privatization will involve significant changes in the\ncomposition of BOCs and, hence, a loss of position, income, and associated social prestige.\nFurthermore, many sector ministries have traditionally used SOEs as an additional source of\nrevenue to finance part of their expenditures and have enjoyed wide ranging benefits which will\nbe withdrawn. To counter resistance from these vested interests, the proposed system of\ncorporate governance is designed to give BODs greater authority and autonomy, thereby\nreducing their willingness to collude with incompetent BOCs. Furthermore, the appointment\nagreements for directors and commissioners will change the incentive system for both groups\nby linking incentives to actual performance.\n120. The third risk relates to the lack of capacity within the Government to effectively oversee\nand monitor SOE reforms and restructuring, and implement them in a timely and effective\nmanner. The major bottleneck could be MSOE as it is lacking experience in these areas. To\nmitigate  this  risk,  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  enhance  MSOE's  capacity  in  financial  and\noperational analysis, corporate restructuring, legal aspects of restructuring and privatization,\nand corporate governance (footnote 5). Additional TA will be provided in conjunction with the\nProgram to ensure continued momentum in this capacity building efforts (footnote 6). The\nProgram also prescribes strict accountability on the part of members of BOCs, who have\ntraditionally  been  selected  from  the  ranks  of  bureaucrats  and  retired  military,  without", "34\nnecessarily having qualifications in accounting, management, or law. While there are examples\nof BOC members with adequate qualifications who are performing satisfactorily, many current\nmembers will not be able to cope with their new responsibilities. The Program will alleviate the\nproblem in two ways. First, MSOE will review of the capabilities of the BOC members. Those\nwith no relevant skills will be replaced. Second, necessary training will be provided to the\nremaining BOC members.\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\n121. In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of Loan Agreement, as\ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  policy  matrix\n(Appendix 1), will be in effect for the duration of the program period;\n(ii)  corporate restructuring and privatization of SOEs will be undertaken in a fair,\ntransparent, and (to the extent commercially practicable) competitive manner,\nand only after a thorough analysis of the benefits of the chosen restructuring\noption has taken place; and the Government will make the necessary funds\navailable for debt restructuring of SOEs in a timely manner;\n(iii)  the Government shall ensure that MSOE is provided with appropriate budgetary\nallocations  to  cover  expenses  relating  to  (i)  dissemination  of  corporate\ninformation from SOEs (including annual reports and SCIs) through print media\nor the Internet, (iii) dissemination of information about the Program through the\nInternet,  (iii)  engagement  of  procurement  and  financial  auditors,  and  (iv)\nengagement  of  advisors  for  privatization  transactions  and  debt  rescheduling\nnegotiations;\n(iv)  labor retrenchments will be carried out in accordance with the laws of Indonesia,\nand  the  Government  will  make  the  necessary  funds  available  for  voluntary\nretirement schemes in a timely manner;\n(v)  public awareness campaigns will be developed and implemented to advertise the\nbenefits of the privatization program; and\n(vi)  proceeds from the loan will not be utilized for SOE investment in modernization\nand capacity enlargement.\nIX.  RECOMMENDATION\n122. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of\nIndonesia for the State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program from ADB's\nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-\nbased loan facility, an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and\nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the\ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n8 November 2001", "35\nAPPENDIXES\nCited on\nNumber Title Page\n(page, para.)\n1 Development Policy Letter and Policy Matrix 36 2,8\n2 Program Framework 46 2,8\n3 Coverage and Implementation Schedule of\nthe Proposed Program and Related Technical 51 6,22\nAssistance\n4 Poverty Impact Assessment 56 26,91\n5 Matrix of Potential Environmental Impacts of\n63 29,101\nPolicy Covenants\n6 Ineligible Items 68 31,107", "Appendix 1, page 1\nMIMSTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF INCONESIA\nJakarta, October 31, 2001\nMr. Tadao China\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nManila, Philippines\nRe: Development Policy Letter\nDear Mr. President,\n1. The economic crisis that affects Indonesia since late 1997 brought to an end three\ndecades of uninterrupted economic growth. The crisis has crippled the economy. It dislocated\nthe stable macroeconomic structure before the crisis due in part to the huge debt increase\nbrought about by the currency depreciation. The crisis also triggered a political transition during\nthat period. Subsequent political changes in our difficult transition to a parliamentary democracy\nalso affected our efforts to stabilize the economy.\n2. Since the crisis, the International Monetary Fund has been assisting us in designing and\nimplementing a macroeconomic stabilization program to restructure our economy and make it\nmore open, competitive and sustainable. The Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and other\ndevelopment partners had worked closely with the IMF to support cur restructuring efforts that\nincluded substantive reforms in the real sector and public sector governance.\n3. The  Asian  Development  Bank  has  been  at  the  forefront  during  the  crisis  with  its\nassistance to the financial sector. The loan complemented the IMF and WB financial sector\nreform program, including bank recapitalization. This loan also supported efforts to improve\nfinancial governance and development of the capital market. Over the past four years, the ADB\nalso extended valuable support for our efforts in decentralization, power sector, industrial and\ntrade liberalization and in education, agriculture, and poverty programs. The ADB technical\nassistance  program  has  also  improved  governance  through  an  audit  program  in  the  state\nattorney department and legal support for establishment anti corruption and anti monopoly\ncommissions.\n4. Although it has been four years since the crisis, our economic recovery remains fragile.\nDomestic political uncertainties have contributed to delays in implementing the reform programs.\nThe election of Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri to be the fifth president of our Republic\nin late July ended domestic political uncertainties. A new cabinet was appointed on 9 August. It\nquickly concluded a Letter of Intent with the IMF and resumed our relations with the international\ncommunity including the successful conclusion of our Paris Club II arrangement. A draft FY 2002\nbudget was submitted and subsequently approved by the concerned parliamentary commission.\nHowever, the attack on US World Trade Center on 11 September and its impact on the global\neconomy has placed at risk our efforts to sustain progress in economic recovery. This has\nstrengthened our resolve to speed up our reform program including the state enterprise sector.", "Appendix 1, page 2\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA\n5. The reform of our state enterprise sector is an integral part of our overall recovery\nstrategy to improve our economy\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness. The performance of our\nSOEs  has  deteriorated  over  the  years.  Poor  financial  management  and  supervision,  weak\ngovernance structures, protected markets and monopolies are some of the reasons for the\ninefficiencies in these enterprises and many have continued to be a heavy burden on our\nbudget.\n6. The  government  has  attempted  to  deal  with  the  sector  reform  by  transferring  the\nresponsibility for SOE administration from the Ministry of Finance to a new State Ministry for\nEmpowerment in May 1998. A strategic goal of this ministry was to improve the performance of\nSOEs through restructuring and privatization. A technical assistance extended by the ADB\ncontributed to the preparation of a Master Plan for SOE Reforms that was adopted by the\ngovernment in May 2000. This Plan outlines the broad objectives, policies and guidelines on\nrestructuring and privatization of SOEs. The State Ministry was dissolved in October 1999 with a\nchange in government and the Ministry of Finance regained its supervision over SOEs. The SOE\nreform program was continued under the Ministry of Finance. The present government accorded\nhigh priority to SOE reform and a Ministry for State Owned Enterprises was reintroduced when\nthe government took office in August 2001.\n7. When the SOE reform program commenced in 1998, a group of 12 of the largest\nenterprises in the telecom, mining, cement, airports, seaports, tool roads, steel and plantation\nsectors were identified for priority restructuring and privatization. The experienced gained allows\nu~  to  accelerate  the  reform  process  to  improve  enterprise  efficiency,  promote  greater\ntransparency and accountability and corporate governance. These are reflected in our program\nfor systematic reform of the SOE sector.\n8. This program contains five components:\n(i) instilling improved corporate governance practices,\n(ii) separating public service obligations from SOEs\u2019 commercial operations,\n(iii)  implementing corporate restructuring and privatization,\n(iv)  managing social impacts of SOE reforms, and\n(v) introduce competitive and transparent processes of procurement.\n9 The specific objectives and measures to be pursued under the Program are set out\nhereunder.", "Appendix 1, page 3\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA\n10. The Program will introduce sound practices for corporate governance\u2014a broad set of\nincentives, structures, and procedures that will drive SOEs to act in the best interests of their\nultimate shareholders \u2014 the public. A Statement of Corporate Intent will be the major instrument\nto enforce accountability of SOEs and will allow the Government to effectively uphold property\nrights. The Program will improve the quality and availability of SOE corporate information. This\nincludes developing a timetable for complying with uniform accounting standards applicable to all\nSOEs, lodging timely information with the Company Register and piloting the function of a\ncorporate secretary who will be responsible for providing corporate information to the public. The\nfinancial  transparency  of  SOEs  will  be  enhanced  so  that  prospective  investors  can  readily\nassess SOE investment opportunities. The accountability of Directors and Commissioners will be\nenhanced through contractual arrangements clearly outlining their rights and obligations.\n11. The  Program  supports  the  restructuring  and  eventual  privatization  of  SOEs  in  a\nstructured and transparent manner. A systematic and analytical framework is already being\napplied to assess the financial and commercial viability of the SOEs and define their financial\nand operational restructuring needs. Based on the assessment, the Government will move to\nliquidate the commercially and financially non-viable SOEs, undertake appropriate restructuring\nof the commercially viable SOEs before privatization, and will implement plans of privatization for\nthose SOEs which need to undergo only limited restructuring prior to privatization. Under the\nProgram, the Government will continue the process of separating public service obligations from\npurely commercial  activities  of  SOEs  and  putting  in  place  a  transparent  system  of  explicit\nsubsidies for socially desired services. The Program will also develop and introduce competitive\nmechanisms for publicly tendering contracts for these services.\n12. The  SOE  restructuring  and  privatization  is  likely  to  render  a  significant  number  of\nemployees redundant. The Program will establish a systematic process of consultation and\nnegotiations  on  labor  rationalization.  A  transparent  policy  will  be  developed  to  deal  with\nredundancies, retraining and pension issues. Within the policy framework, SOEs will submit their\nindividual labor restructuring plans to the Government, which will ensure the application of best\npractices in negotiations between employees and management.\n13. The Program will have a strong anti-corruption thrust by applying and enforcing existing\nrules and regulations in the area of SOE procurement. Specifically, the Government will publicly\nannounce that SCE procurements shall comply with the national procurement guidelines. The\nGovernment will also engage external auditors to conduct random audits of SOE procurement\npractices and will publish the audit reports.", "38 Appendix 1, page 4\nMINISTER OF FINANCE\nOF THE ~EPUBL~C QF INDONECIA\n14. The State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program as summarized\nabove sets out the broad agenda for furthering the SOE restructuring and privatization. The\nGovernment  is  convinced  that  the  comprehensive  measures  to  be  implemented  under  the\nProgram along with the parallel structural reforms will pave the way for efficient and broad-based\neconomic  growth  in  the  coming  years.  The  two  ADB  technical  assistance  projects  for\nprivatization and restructuring of SOEs and commercialization of public service obligations will\nstrengthen the government\u2019s efforts to reform the sector.\n15. In addition to such advisory support, the SOE reform program will incur substantial fiscal\ncost for the reform of the sector. The fiscal constrain of the government will inhibit sustained\nefforts to reform the sector. In this connection, the government requests for a loan of $400\nmillion from ADB to support the implementation of this program.\n16. The government is committed to the timetable for implementation of the policy matrix on\nSOE Reform. The government will set up a Program Steering Committee to oversee program\nimplementation. This group will include representatives from different ministries and agencies to\nimprove coordination in the implementation of this program. The government will maintain an\nactive  policy  dialogue  with  the  ADB  during  program  implementation,  including  introducing\nadditional measures to ensure that the Program goals are met.\n17.

The State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program (SOEGPP) makes\na positive contribution to the poverty reduction objective of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nin  Indonesia  through  (i)  removing  market  distorting  interventions  to  stimulate  growth,  and\n(ii) improving the quality of governance in a critical area of the public-private sector interface.\n2. The quality of governance is critical to poverty reduction.1 Since effective and efficient\ndelivery of basic services by the public sector matters most to the poor, weak governance hurts\nthem  disproportionately.  Public  sector  inefficiency,  corruption,  and  waste  have  left  the\nGovernment  with  insufficient  resources  to  support  the  requisite  level  and  quality  of  public\nservices and targeted antipoverty programs. The SOEGPP will support the establishment of\ngood governance, giving a role model for both public and private sectors, which, if followed, will\nfacilitate  participatory,  pro-poor  policies,  as  well  as  sound  macroeconomic  management.\nSOEGPP  will  advance  the  transparent  use  of  public  funds,  encourage  sound  fiscal\nmanagement, promote efficient delivery of public services, and help establish the rule of law.\n3. Privatization  as  supported  by  the  SOEGPP  will  improve  productive  and  allocative\nefficiency.  Therefore,  prices  of  goods  and  services  produced  by  the  privatized  enterprises\nshould decline and their quality should improve. While SOEs have been heavily subsidized in\nthe past, most of the subsidies have been abolished or are in the process of being abolished.\nPrivatization  will  only  occur  after  the  enterprises  have  been  placed  into  a  competitive\nenvironment.  By  removing  economic  distortions  in  the  competitive  environment  first,  the\nGovernment increases the probability that higher productivity and allocative efficiency will be\nachieved.\n4. Privatization affects income distribution through three channels. The first channel is the\nshift of real assets from the state to the private sector, with consequences for the distribution of\ncapital income. If the price paid for the asset is close to the discounted present value of the\nfuture income stream, no negative distributive impact will arise. The problem arises where\nassets  are  sold  at  a  price  below  value,  particularly  if  due  to  corruption.  To  address  this,\nSOEGPP will establish sales procedures establishing maximum transparency, and support the\nprivatization  by  providing  privatization  experts  through  TAs.  The  second  channel  is  labor\nincome, which should generally increase over time for those retained in their job. The third\nchannel is wage differentials, which are typically wider in the private than in the public sector,\nand privatization will tend to reinforce them. However, the decompression of pay scales can be\nexpected to be phased in slowly over time.\n5. SOEs are not a major source of employment. In total, the SOEs employ about 700,000\npeople  directly  and  another  700,000  indirectly  through  contract  and  subcontract  labor\narrangements. This is less than 1.5 percent of the overall labor force2 and 4.5 percent of the\nformal labor force.3  Furthermore, wages and benefits paid by the SOEs are not significantly\ndifferent from those paid by the private sector for the most vulnerable category of worker, those\nbelow the supervisor level. Unlike some formerly centrally planned economies, the SOEs were\n                  \n1 Compare  ADB, Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Manila, page 8, 19 October.\n2 As of August 1999, this was 94 million people, and defined as those 15 years or older who were working, were\ntemporarily absent from work, or who didn\u2019t have work but were looking for work. \u201cWorking\u201d is an activity done for\npay or to assist others in obtaining pay or profit for the duration of at least one hour during the survey week.\n3 The formal labor force is defined as comprising employers and employees, and excludes the self-employed and\nunpaid family workers.", "57 Appendix 4, page 2\nnot a major source of employment and they did not provide a large range of social services.4\nNonetheless, treatment of labor by the SOEs sets an important standard of behavior for private\nsector enterprises.\n6. SOEs have about 10-20 percent surplus employment, or 70,000-140,000 people, with 20\npercent considered an outside maximum and 10 percent representing the more reasonable\nestimate.  As  national  open  unemployment  was  estimated  as  6,030,000  in  August  1999,\novernight layoffs would not result in an appreciable increase in overall numbers although the\nimpact could be significant at a local level. Surplus managerial staff exists where firms have\nundergone mergers such as in the plantation industry as well as below the supervisor level\nwhere changes in technology have reduced the need for low skill labor and necessitate a\ndifferent skill mix.  For this reason, most layoffs are likely to occur at lower levels and therefore\nwill affect people who will then be less likely to find equivalent employment in the formal sector.\nLegally mandated severance standards are considered inadequate by labor representatives.\nNegotiated settlements tend to exceed the minimum standards. Compared to the private sector,\nSOE employees are at a disadvantage in such negotiations as prior to 1999 they were not\nallowed to unionize or engage in collective bargaining. As a result they have little practical\nexperience in negotiating their interest with management. Conversely management has had\nlittle experience in dialogue with labor in employment and employment related issues.\n7. For this reason, SOEGPP puts a strong emphasis on establishing a consultative working\ngroup  on  labor  relations,  with  representatives  of  all  stakeholders  to  develop  a  labor\nrationalization policy within the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (MSOE). The consultative\nworking group is expected to develop standards for negotiating settlements, to serve as a\nconduit for information for labor representatives, and provide a forum for policy discussion\nregarding unresolved labor issues such as the treatment of contract labor. Once approved by\nthe Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), this report will be available to the\npublic  and  will  provide  information  to  labor  representatives  and  advocates  regarding  the\nGovernment\u2019s intentions and schedule for corporate restructuring and privatization. Thus, the\nSOEGPP will provide a channel for workers and their representatives to participate more fully\nand in an informed way in a dialogue to ensure their best interest.\n8. The poverty impact assessment matrixes are presented below, with a more detailed\ndiscussion of the individual conditionalities of the SOEGPP.\nA.  Policy Area A: Corporate Governance\n9. These  measures  will  result  in  (i)  the  implementation  of  new  corporate  governance\npolicies  and  procedures  for  MSOE  and  boards  of  commissioners  and  directors,  (ii) an\nindependent financial and management audit of all SOEs, (iii) a review of commissioners and\ndirectors for more than half of all SOEs, and (iv) implementation of performance incentive\nsystems for management and employees. These measures will also introduce sound corporate\ngovernance practices to empower and encourage managers to act in the best interest of their\nshareholders, the people of Indonesia.  Implementation of the statements of corporate intent will\nrequire  SOEs  to  report  compliance  on  a  number  of  regulations,  including  those  regarding\nemployment. Overall, these measures will result in better management and fairer treatment of\n                  \n4 Certain industries that developed in remote areas such as in the plantation and mining sector provided access to\nsocial services, clinics, and schools. Prior to the crisis, such services were being rationalized. Other benefits were\nlimited to specific categories of employees. Until recently in the plantation sector only employees in positions\ndesignated as staff were entitled to a pension.", "58 Appendix 4, page 3\nlabor and ultimately greater efficiency and returns to public investment, growth, and poverty\nreduction.

Policy Area B: Commercialization of Public Service Obligations\n10. The SOEs are responsible for ensuring the provision of public goods and services\nnecessary for national development purposes but have done so at high cost. At the same time,\nthe  assignment  of  monopoly  rights  and  protectionism  has  stifled  the  development  of  a\ncompetitive private sector. Cross-subsidy between profitable and unprofitable operations within\na company mask inefficiencies of operation and fails to promote the efficient provision of quality\nservices.  As a result of protectionist policies and poor management, Indonesian consumers pay\nhigher prices for a range of essential commodities, including drugs and pesticides. The efforts to\nprovide subsidies to particular sectors have resulted in market distortions, capture of subsidies\nby  unintended  groups  including  the  producers  themselves,  and  a  poor  return  to  national\ninvestment. If subsidies cannot be abolished for political reasons, their true cost should be\nexplicit and the subsidy delivered in an efficient and targeted fashion.\n11. The measures promoted under the program identify the types of SOE public service\nobligations and establish mechanisms for efficient provision by the private sector or continued\nprovision by SOEs with clear identification of costs and intended levels of subsidies. Regulated\nand  private  provision  of  public  service  obligations  or  continued  SOE  provision  with  the\nestablishment of clear cost centers and subsidy mechanisms will reduce the distorting impact of\nthese  obligations  on  SOE  operations  while  promoting  low  cost  and  efficient  provision  of\nservices.

Policy Area C:  Corporate Restructuring\n12. These measures develop guidelines, procedures, and a timetable for privatization for\ncommercially  viable  SOEs.  This  will  provide  the  MSOE  with  an  operational  procedure  for\nimplementing privatization. To reduce the drain on the budget, criteria and procedures are\nagreed upon for liquidating nonviable SOEs. To obtain the best price for SOEs slated for\nprivatization, their profitability and potential is demonstrated through the implementation of\nperformance targets as set out in the statements of corporate intent (SCIs) (see policy area A).\nThe privatization process is accelerated through the selection of the best privatization options of\nSOEs requiring limited restructuring and reduction of the shareholding of SOEs where the\nGovernment  has  decided  to  retain  some  interest.  Table  A4.3  summarizes  the  effects  of\nrestructuring SOEs.\nTable A4.3: Effects of Corporate Restructuring\nChannel Direct Indirect Macro Non-Poor\nTransfers Increased government\nrevenue for development\nexpenditures\nNet Impact Positive\nNarrative These measures are necessary to enable the Government to obtain the best return from the\ndivestiture of commercially viable SOEs and reduce the drain on the national budget from the\nsupport of non viable SOEs.\nSOE = state-owned enterprises.\nD.  Policy Area D:  Labor Redundancies\n13. The level of skill and the education profile of the SOE labor force is higher than that of\nthe formal labor force where 44 percent of the labor force has no more than an elementary\nschool education. The plantation sector, accounting for 50 percent of the labor force, is a\nsignificant exception to this. In the remaining SOEs, the proportion of low skill labor is very low\ndue to the generally higher skill requirement of the production process as well as the practice of\noutsourcing  unskilled  and  casual  work.  Low  skill  labor  for  casual  work,  stevedoring,\nlandscaping, and general cleaning services are obtained through service contracts with private\nfirms. As a result, outside of the plantation sector, SOE employees tend to be more educated\nthan the general labor force.\n14. As with the private sector, the SOE labor force tends to be segregated by gender with\nwomen clustered in occupations at the low end of the pay scale. In the plantations they tend\nnurseries, carry out maintenance, spread fertilizer, harvest cacao and tea, tap rubber, or work\nas clerics. They are seldom in supervisory positions. Outside of the plantations women tend to\nbe found in SOEs that require a high degree of customer service such as toll collection or cabin\nflight assistance.", "60 Appendix 4, page 5\n1.  Staffing issues\n15. The degree to which staffing levels, staff qualifications, and staff management are an\nissue varies significantly from company to company. Part of the overstaffing problem has arisen\nfrom the slowdown in demand and is to some extent self correcting. Some SOEs provide a\nknowledge-based product (chemicals, semiconductors) with a large investment in staff training.\nIt is in the interest of such firms to retain their employees during a downturn. Some SOEs are\noverstaffed  at  management  levels  as  a  result  of  merger  and  consolidation.  The  present\nplantation and forestry SOEs are the result of the consolidation of smaller plantations and\nrelated downstream business units. PTP Nusantara IV is the result of a merger of 25 separate\nbusiness units and consolidation has resulted in significant duplication of administrative staff\nand management staff.\n2.  Labor Relations\n16. Labor relations are in a state of change following the introduction of a new labor law that\nenabled free association and the establishment of new unions in keeping with International\nLabor Organization (ILO) convention 87. This law came into force in June 1999. Previously,\nSOE  employees  were  considered  quasi-civil  servants.  SOE  employees  were  obligatory\nmembers of Korpri (Corps of Civil Servants) and were not allowed to become labor union\nmembers. SOE employee participation in Korpri became discretionary in November 1998, after\nwhich SOE employees could join labor unions and enter into collective labor agreements.\nEstablishment of plant-level unions within the SOEs has been initiated with MSOE\u2019s blessing,\nalthough the role of these unions is curtailed by their relative lack of experience. In addition SOE\nemployees and contract workers have begun to join the established labor unions. Various\nefforts are under way to promote understanding of the role and function of unions among\nworkers and management. The Ministry of Manpower, with ILO assistance, has been training\nunions  in  how  to  function  in  both  private  and  public  sector  organizations  and  promoting\nunderstanding of labor unions and collective bargaining for personnel management. The labor\nfederations such as SPSI (All Indonesian Worker\u2019s Union), SPSI-R (All-Indonesian Workers\nUnion-Reformation), and SBSI (Indonesia Prosperous Worker\u2019s Union) have been carrying out\ntheir own outreach efforts.  While considerable work remains to develop mature labor unions,\nthese organizations agree that their own efforts will be facilitated by a policy dialogue promoting\nopen discussion of labor issues and by access to information regarding labor practices and\nplans for restructuring and privatization. The establishment of a consultative working group on\nlabor rationalization will enable such policy and access.\n3.  Labor Protection Issues\n17. Labor protection issues that are likely to arise as a result of a retrenchment process\ninclude entitlement to employer\u2019s contributions with pension fund, unfunded liabilities, payout for\nSOEs with insufficient funds, and provisions for subcontracted labor.  Support may be required\nto fulfill pension obligations for early retirement pay. While many SOEs are establishing or have\nestablished fully funded pension funds in conformity with new Ministry of Finance regulations,\nsome have not been able to meet the funding requirements and continue to hold their pensions\nin  pension  foundations.  Other  SOEs  pay  pensions  out  of  operating  expenses.  Employer\ncontributions match or exceed employee pension contributions. While most pension schemes\nhave provisions for early retirement, few have provisions for retrenchment. Clarification must be\nsought from the Ministry of Finance regarding entitlement to employer contributions. Measures\nwill be required to avoid imposing an undue burden on pension funds that have invested in long-", "61 Appendix 4, page 6\nterm instruments and may find a large and unscheduled pay-out requirement difficult to meet.\nFunding will be required for firms unable to meet severance payment obligations.  In some\ncases, additional provisions will be required for subcontracted labor.\n4.  Current Experience with Retrenchment\n18. While SOE restructuring was under way on a limited scale prior to the crisis, the need for\nrestructuring  has  intensified.  However  there  has  been  little  experience  with  large  scale\nretrenchment.  As  a  consequence,  few  company  regulations,  pension  funds,  or  labor\nagreements have provisions for retrenchment.\n19. The experience to date has been mixed. The national aircraft manufacturer (IPTN) had a\nrelatively smooth retrenchment process beginning with benchmarking and dissemination of\nbenchmarking  results,  then  discussion  and  debate  among  employees,  culminating  in  the\nformulation of a formal employee recommendation for a retrenchment plan, procedures, and\nlevel of compensation for consideration by management. The plan gave several scenarios of\nwhich one was adopted. The program was announced and a center established where workers\ncould calculate what they would get if they accepted the voluntary retrenchment and early\nretirement scheme. Programs were run for families of employees and the spouse had to agree\nfor the application to be accepted. The first wave targeted all employees with only elementary\nand junior high education. The second wave targeted employees from vocational junior and\nsenior high schools. By the time of the ADB mission appraisal, 2,500 employees had been\nretrenched through this process and a third selection wave was under way. PT Wijaya Karya\nhad undergone a 15 percent reduction in the workforce. This was facilitated by the provision for\nretrenchment in all employment agreements and a system for regular personnel review and\nassessment. Retrenched employees were provided counseling. Some outplacement assistance\nand some lower level employees were provided skills training. The 40 private banks unilaterally\nestablished a package of compensation for workers, which was not accepted, and this has led\nto acrimonious and protracted discussion. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency finally\nreached an agreement with retrenched employees of banks after 18 months of protracted\nnegotiations.\n20. The current best practices indicate the difficulty in developing rules of thumb in terms of\nmonths of pay that would constitute fair practice. Industry characteristics, state of the labor\nmarket, skill level of the employee, and length of tenure are variables to be considered. The\nultimate measure of an effective arrangement is worker and management satisfaction with the\nagreement. This is reached through a process involving the provision of information followed by\nconsultations and then negotiations.\n21. The measures under this part of the Program support strengthening the system for\nsocial protection in Indonesia. Existing legal standards are generally agreed to be adequate.\nHowever, they can only regulate minimum standards as it is difficult to develop standards that\nare adequate to cover the full range of skills, experience, and labor market segments in which\nthey are to be applied. ADB, through its technical assistance, will have a significant role in\nassisting MSOE to develop policies for a retrenchment process based on the best practices\nevolving within the SOEs and from international example. This will help ensure that workers\nreceive an equitable compensation package and to resolve issues regarding entitlement to\nemployer\u2019s  contributions  to  pension  funds,  unfunded  liabilities,  payouts  for  SOEs  with\ninsufficient funds, potential burden on pension funds, and any issues that may arise from\nexcessive use of contract labor.", "62 Appendix 4, page 7\nTable A4.4: Effects of Retrenchment Mitigation\nChannel Non-Poor\nLabor (cid:1)  Strengthens labor protection by promoting best practices in retrenchment.(1)\n(cid:1)  Ensures that retrenched workers are able to obtain the agreed payouts and benefits due.\n(2)\nCrucial (1)  Establishment of procedures and process for retrenchment that provide information,\nAssumptions communication, and negotiations through the Consultative Working Group\n(2)  Resolution of issues regarding entitlement to employer contribution to pension funds,\nunfunded liabilities, payouts for SOEs with insufficient funds, and potential burden on\npension funds.\nNet Impact Positive\nNarrative The benefits of these measures to strengthen labor protection practices goes beyond the\nprogram to benefit workers in the private sector.
