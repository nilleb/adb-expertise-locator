The transaction technical assistance (TA) is proposed to support the implementation of \nthe COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program, which provides a \n$250 million loan as budget support to the Republic of Azerbaijan. Through this TA, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will support the timely and effective monitoring of the CARES Program \nas well as the strengthening of the critical public financial management and social security \nsystems that are essential to carry out the government\u2019s countercyclical pandemic response \nmeasures without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability. The TA\u2019s outputs contribute to achievement \nof the expected development outcome of the CARES Program that the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) outbreak is more effectively managed and its adverse social and economic impacts \nare reduced.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the economy as a result of the lockdowns \nin 2020 and early 2021; business closures; a downturn in trade, tourism, and remittances; and \ndrop in consumer demand. Azerbaijan suffered from a twin supply shock with the decline in oil \nprices and cut in oil production under an agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum \nExporting Countries. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s projections indicate (i) a gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) contraction of 4.3% in 2020 and a rebound in growth to 2.3% in 2021, (ii) widening \nof the budget deficit\u2013GDP ratio to 6.4% in 2020 and 5.2% in 2021 from a surplus of 8.2% in 2019, \nand (iii) a rise in unemployment rate to 6.5% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2021 from 4.8% in 2019.1 To \nmitigate the impact of the pandemic, the government implemented countercyclical pandemic \nresponse  measures  totaling  AZN3.5  billion  ($2.06  billion)  in  2020  and  AZN3,014.6  million \n($1,773.2 million) in 2021. These measures aim at enhancing the health care system, expanding \nsocial protection, and supporting macroeconomic stabilization and job creation. \n \n3.  The COVID-19 pandemic has not only negatively impacted health care system capacity \nand exposed its weaknesses, but also constrained fiscal and debt management capacity and \ntested the effectiveness of the social security system. Although Azerbaijan had been successfully \nrecovering from the 2015\u20132016 recession and implementing debt and fiscal management reforms, \nthe COVID-19 crisis and oil price shock have increased the fiscal risks because of increased \nexpenditures,  a  sharp  fall  in  revenues,  and  growing  operational  losses  from  state-owned \nenterprises. As a result, implementation of the fiscal rule on State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan transfers \nand  budget  expenditures  had  to  be  temporarily  frozen  until  2022.  Although  public  debt  in \nAzerbaijan is low, additional vigilance is now required to monitor risks and ensure that the targets \nof the medium-term debt management strategy and fiscal consolidation efforts are not derailed. \n \n4.  In addition to supporting the timely and effective monitoring of the CARES Program \nimplementation,  the  proposed  TA  will  help  the  government  enhance  the  fiscal  and  debt \nmanagement systems as well as strengthen the social security system, recently introduced \nmandatory health insurance, and gender-based targeting and service delivery to effectively cover \nthe poor and vulnerable population when poverty incidence and unemployment are on the rise. \nThe TA will provide policy advice and capacity building. 2 \n \n1 Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 March 2021.
