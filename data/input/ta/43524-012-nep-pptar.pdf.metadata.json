Conceptual Wastewater Masterplan (2010-2025) was approved by the Government of \nNepal (the government) in 2010 and investment under Kathmandu Valley Urban Environment \nImprovement Project is envisaged in 2013. In order to carry out due diligence on technical, \neconomic, financial, social, governance, poverty and social, and safeguards for subprojects \nunder the ensuing loan, a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is necessary. The \nproposed  PPTA  will  also  suggest  the  ways  to  suitably  coordinate  with  ongoing  and  other \nproposed projects in water and wastewater sectors in Kathmandu Valley.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  Feasibility study of the project will be prepared under the PPTA. The major outputs and \nactivities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nReview of conceptual  March 2012  Inception report  February 2012 \nwastewater masterplan \nProposed solution for  April 2012   Draft final report  September 2012 \nseparation of storm water \nsystem from wastewater \nsystem. \nFinalization of Packaging and  May 2012  Final Report  October 2012 \nProcurement Plan    \nSupport for enhancement of  February\u2013 October     \nproject readiness and  2012 \nexpediting implementation \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, administered by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \nremuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, office accommodation and transport, and \ncontingencies and other in-kind contributions.
