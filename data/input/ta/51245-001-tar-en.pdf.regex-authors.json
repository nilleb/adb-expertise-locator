INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Tuvalu recognizes that improved macroeconomic sustainability and \npublic service delivery is critical given the development challenges that it faces. The knowledge \nand support technical assistance (TA) will help implement and sustain the government\u2019s medium-\nterm public sector management reform agenda by supporting efforts to improve public financial \nmanagement practices and public service delivery.  \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for 2018\u20132020, approved in September 2017, and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, \n2016\u20132020, which serves as the country partnership strategy for Tuvalu.1 The TA supports \nstrategic areas in Tuvalu\u2019s National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020 (Te \nKakeega III), notably good governance; the economy, growth and stability; infrastructure; and \nsupport services.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Development context. Tuvalu is a fragile microstate made up of a series of small, low-\nlying  coral  atoll  and  reef  islands  and  has  an estimated  population  of  11,000 (2013).  It  is \ngeographically isolated, vulnerable to adverse climatic events and economic shocks, and has a \nsmall and narrow production and export base. The country relies heavily on external sources of \nincome, and the capacity-constrained public sector is the main employer and driver of economic \nactivity, with public expenditures equivalent to about 126% of gross domestic product in 2016. \nAlmost all goods, and even many services, are imported. With few exports, the government is \nalmost entirely dependent on donor aid and unstable external income streams such as revenue \nfrom fishing-license fees, remittances, earnings from the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, and \nrent of its \u201cdot.tv\u201d internet domain name.3  \n \n4.  Macroeconomic outlook. After being hard hit by the global economic crisis in 2008, \nTuvalu has returned to a path of steady economic growth, averaging 2.5% over 2014\u20132016, and \ngrowth is projected to rise to 3.2% in 2017, driven by large government-funded capital projects. \nGovernment revenues have been supported by strong fishing-license earnings, sovereign wealth \nfund earnings, and development partner assistance, resulting in a fiscal surplus in 2016 equivalent \nto  34%  of  gross  domestic  product.4 Despite  the  favorable  performance,  the  August  2017 \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  staff  mission  concluded  that  Tuvalu\u2019s  macroeconomic  outlook \nremains  susceptible  to  risks,  and  highlighted  the  importance  of  preserving  fiscal  buffers, \nrestraining recurrent expenditures against the need for capital spending, strengthening financial \nsector oversight, and improving the financial performance of public enterprises.5  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

As of 31 March 2017, the \ninvestments of the Tuvalu Trust Fund exceeded its maintained value of A$161 million by A$5.5 million, or 3.4%, while \nthe value of savings in the Consolidated Investment Fund, projected at A$26.2 million by end-2017, is above the \n16% threshold of the Tuvalu Trust Fund-maintained value. \n5  International Monetary Fund. 2017.

Since 2012, \nthe government has targeted macroeconomic and fiscal management reforms implemented \nunder a single government-led policy reform matrix (PRM) to enhance collaboration between \ndevelopment partners, which have used the matrix as the basis for providing general budget \nsupport.6 ADB\u2019s ongoing capacity development TA7 has played a critical role in supporting several \nspecific procurement, public enterprise, and fiscal management reforms under the first three \nphases of the PRM.8 Reforms achieved under these phases triggered $13.0 million in budget \nsupport from development partners including ADB grants in 2012 and 2015 totaling $4.35 million.9 \nThe fourth phase, covering the period 2016\u20132020, focuses on preserving fiscal buffers, pursuing \nexpenditure and revenue efficiencies, and improving levels of public service delivery. Using a \nmulti-year approach, this phase maintains well-defined high-level objectives while allowing for \nsome flexibility to shape specific reforms and adjust priority activities as the situation on the \nground changes and needs evolve. \n6.  The TA is a response to the government\u2019s request to address three specific reform gaps \narticulated under phase 4 of the PRM, building on earlier reforms supported by ADB. The \nimplementation of these reforms will be anchored to ADB\u2019s pipeline policy-based operations. The \nreform areas are set out below.  \n \n7.  Strengthening procurement compliance. Public procurement has been a high priority \nfor the government, and its inclusion in the PRM has led to significant progress. From 2012 to \n2014,  ADB  supported  the  adoption  of  the  2012  National  Procurement  Policy;  the  Public \nProcurement Act, 2013; and the Public Procurement Regulations, 2014, including an established \noversight function and a two-tier complaints system backed by independent arbitration. The \ngovernment established the central procurement unit (CPU) in 2014 and ADB trained its staff to \nensure that government resources were being effectively used for procurement transactions, and \nthat procurement practitioners were using standard bidding and other documents.10 The CPU \nannual  report  and  a  centralized  procurement  website  have  also  helped  strengthen  public \nprocurement governance. However, compliance remains hindered by the lack of procurement \ncapacity and expertise across government ministries, which has significant flow-on effects relating \nto procurement planning, costing projects, alignment with budget processes, managing the \nprocurement  cycle,  monitoring  levels  of  compliance,  conducting  the  procurement  process, \nmonitoring and reporting on procurement performance, and annual reporting. CPU staff also need \nongoing training and support to manage procurement for new and large national capital projects. \n \n                                                \n6  ADB, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, the World Bank, and, recently, the European Union are \ncollectively supporting the PRM according to their areas of comparative advantage. Support is administered through \nTA and a coordinated program of budget support. The PRM outlines six priority reform areas: public financial \nmanagement, fiscal policy, public administration, public enterprise performance and rationalization, and health and \neducation management.  \n7  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nDevelopment. Manila. \n8  A summary of PRM reform measures implemented between January-October 2012 (phase 1), January 2012-June \n2013 (phase 2), and August 2014-December 2015 (phase 3) (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n3) articulates the continuity and sequencing of reform efforts supported by the respective development partners. \n9  ADB. 2012.

Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Tuvalu for the Strengthened Fiscal Sustainability Program. \nManila. \n10  The CPU has grown and now has five fulltime staff members who are qualified up to level 2 of the Chartered Institute \nof Purchasing and Supply, the UK-based internationally recognized center of excellence in procurement. All staff \nideally should be trained up to levels 3 and 4. If new staff join, they will need to be trained up to at least level 2 as \nquickly as possible. \n ", "3 \n8.  Strengthening public enterprise performance and management. The government \nhas made significant progress in improving the policy and regulatory framework for public \nenterprises. It established the Public Enterprise Reform and Monitoring Unit (PERMU) in 2009, \nenacted the Public Enterprise Act, 2009; removed politicians and civil servants from public \nenterprise boards; and ensured the timely submission of audited annual reports to Parliament.11 \nHowever, significant capacity gaps remain. The two PERMU staff need further training to ensure \nthat public enterprises are complying with the Public Enterprises Act, 2009, and other regulations. \nBecause of staff turnover, Tuvalu Post Limited and Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute accountants \nrequire further training on the use of the Mind Your Own Business (MYOB) accounting software \nto help them prepare financial statements as required under the act. There is also an ongoing \nneed for refresher training for accountants across other public enterprises, and for a training-of-\ntrainers  module  for  experienced  financial  managers  to  train  new  accountants  in  MYOB. \nGovernment efforts to pursue professional management options for the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel failed \nin 2012 because of limited private sector interest. The government granted the Tuvalu National \nProvident Fund (TNPF) a concession to operate the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel, now known as the Funafuti \nLagoon Hotel, in late 2016. As TNPF does not have experience in the hotel business, a condition \nof the concession agreement discussed with ADB is for ADB to provide advisory support to help \nTNPF improve services and explore growth opportunities. \n \n9.  Strengthening resilience through updated building codes. The government has \nasked ADB to revise and update Tuvalu\u2019s draft building code and put in place regulations to \nenforce the code. The current draft Tuvalu building code was published in 1990, but unfortunately \nit exists merely as a reference document because no regulation exists to enforce the code. The \ndestruction of public buildings and private dwellings by Tropical Cyclone Pam in April 2015 has \nadded a level of urgency to finalizing and enforcing the code and supporting regulations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: a greater level of security and prosperity for \nall Tuvaluans (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: improved public sector \nmanagement.12  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n11.  Output 1: Strengthened procurement compliance. The focus will be on improving \ncompliance and capacity of procurement officers that will translate into better procurement \nplanning,  budgeting,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  In  turn  this  will  increase \ngovernment accountability for the use of public funds, promote competition among bidders \n(resulting in better value for money), and promote public confidence in the integrity and fairness \nof public procurement practices. A public procurement specialist will train procurement officers \nacross ministries and CPU staff to ensure that existing procurement systems, processes, and \ndocumentation are understood and utilized. Specialized procurement training for current or new \nCPU staff will improve their capacity and assure Tuvalu\u2019s procurement processes comply with \nhigh international procurement and supply standards. \n \n                                                \n11  The seven public enterprises in Tuvalu are National Bank of Tuvalu, Development Bank of Tuvalu, National Fishing \nCompany of Tuvalu, Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, Tuvalu Maritime \nTraining Institute, and Tuvalu Post Limited. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n12.  Output 2: Strengthened public enterprise performance and management. A public \nenterprise reform specialist (team leader) will work with two PERMU staff members and the board \ndirectors of all seven public enterprises to ensure greater compliance with the Public Enterprises \nAct, 2009, and other regulations, with the aim of increasing the profitability, efficiency, and quality \nof services provided by public enterprises. The team leader will also undertake on-the-job training \nand train PERMU staff through mentoring. An accountant with MYOB expertise will help build the \ncapacity of financial managers in all seven public enterprises and PERMU staff on the use of the \nMYOB software. A key component of this support will be training experienced financial managers \nto train new accountants in MYOB. A hotel management adviser will support TNPF management \nand the hotel manager to improve the performance and service of the Funafuti Lagoon Hotel and \ndevelop strategic marketing and staff training plans. The accountant and the hotel management \nadviser will report to the team leader.13 \n \n13.  Output  3:  Strengthened  resilience  through  updated  building  codes.  A  team \nconsisting of a civil engineer (team leader), an architect, and a legal expert is required to revise \nand update Tuvalu\u2019s building code and put in place an act and regulations to support its \nimplementation. A taskforce established in September 2016 and chaired by the chief executive \nofficer of the Ministry of Public Utilities and Infrastructure has endorsed the terms of reference, \nand the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility will oversee the quality of this work. The architect \nand legal expert will report to the team leader. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $770,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, office space, \nsecretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  Additional \ndevelopment partner financing is expected during TA implementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB is the executing agency and will administer the TA. The Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Development will be the implementing agency for outputs 1 and 2 and the Ministry of \nPublic Utilities and Infrastructure will implement output 3. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2019 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (Outputs 1, 2) \nMinistry of Public Utilities and Infrastructure (Output 3) \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Public Procurement Specialist  Individual Consultant  ADB \nPublic  Enterprise  Reform  Individual Consultant  ADB \nSpecialist \nAccountant   Individual Consultant  ADB \n  Hotel Management Adviser  Individual Consultant  ADB \n                                                \n13 The Public Enterprise Reform Specialist (team leader) is expected to consult with experts engaged by ADB\u2019s Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative, which is supporting public enterprise reforms across ADB\u2019s Pacific developing \nmember countries, to leverage and facilitate alignment with assistance provided in other countries.
