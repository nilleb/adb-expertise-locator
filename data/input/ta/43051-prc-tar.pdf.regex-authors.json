INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  a  country  programming  mission  in  December  2008,  the  Government  of  the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) to help  the Yunnan provincial government \ndevelop a low-carbon economy in Yunnan Province. The TA was included in ADB's 2009 non-\nlending pipeline for the PRC.1 The fact-finding mission was fielded during 21\u201324 October 2009. \nThis report is based on the memorandum of understanding achieved with the government \nduring the fact-finding mission on the impact, outcome, detailed scope of works, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, key activities, and implementation arrangements of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC is the world\u2019s second largest energy consumer after the United States and has \none of the world's fastest growing energy sectors. While energy fuels economic growth and \npoverty reduction, inefficient energy use accelerates resource depletion and severely damages \nthe  environment.  It  is  hard  to  reconcile  continued  energy  consumption  growth  with \nenvironmental  sustainability.  With  a  strong  political  commitment  towards  improving  energy \nefficiency, the government has articulated a clear vision as reflected in its target of quadrupling \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita while only doubling energy use during 2000\u20132020.  \n \n3.  The PRC government has made great efforts to reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions \n2\nand  improve  energy  efficiency.  Its  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2006\u20132010  mandates  a  20% \nreduction  in  energy  intensity2 by  2010,  which  has  been  allocated  to  the  provinces  and \nmunicipalities by the government. Ten key industries have been identified for energy savings, \nand 1,000 enterprises that intensively use energy are now under tight supervision. Meanwhile, \nthe government has adopted a series of incentives, including energy-efficiency funding and \nfinancial  incentives,  and  actively  pursued  industrial  structural  adjustment,  technological \nupgrading,  improved  demand-side  management,  and  decommissioning  inefficient  facilities. \nDespite these efforts, energy intensity reduced relatively slowly in 2006 by 1.79%, 2007 by \n3.66%, and 2008 by 4.59%, leaving heavier challenges for the remaining years of the plan, \n2009\u20132010.  Barriers  to  energy  efficiency  include  shortcomings  in  the  dissemination  of \ninformation on technology and incentives and in the capacity of local government entities and \nofficials. \n \n4.  The PRC is making efforts to address global climate change. The carbon intensity3 of the \nnational economy has declined in the past 2 decades. According to International Energy Agency, \nfrom 1990 to 2004, the PRC's carbon intensity fell by 49.5%. But there is still a very large scope \nto further reduce the carbon intensity by (i) promoting a more diversified energy mix to reduce \nreliance on carbon intensive fossil fuels,4 and (ii) consistently improve energy intensity to bring it \nat par with other developed economies such as Japan and the United States.5 In 2006, the \nGovernment  initially  planned  to  develop  a  low-carbon  economy  in  the  National  Evaluation \nReport on Climate Change. In 2007, the Government declared that the PRC would promote a \nlow-carbon economy by improving energy efficiency, developing low-carbon energy technology, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 October 2009.  \n2  The amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP. \n3  The amount of carbon emitted per unit of GDP. \n4  Coal, the highest carbon fossil fuel provides more than two-third of the PRC's primary energy needs.  \n5  The PRC energy intensity at about 0.92 tons of oil equivalent (tce) is much higher compared with 0.15 tce for \nJapan and 0.21 tce for the United States. \n ", "2   \nexpanding carbon sinks,6 and developing renewable energy.7 More recently in November 2009, \nthe PRC has announced to reduce carbon intensity of its GDP in 2020 by 40%-45% compared \nwith  2005  level.8 These  have  been  recognized  as  strong  political  commitments  by  the \ngovernment to develop a low-carbon economy. However, as low-carbon economy is very new to \nthe PRC, corresponding strategies and polices are required to promote it at different levels.  \n \n5.  Yunnan is a southwestern province of the PRC, and like others, has experienced robust \neconomic growth over the past 2 decades. In 2008, its GDP was CNY570 billion, 11% higher \nthan in 2007. However, its GDP per capita in 2008 was only CNY12,547, or 60% of the national \naverage. 9 Yunnan's  economic  development  has  been  energy-intensive.  Its  total  energy \nconsumption in 2008 amounted to 76 million tons of coal equivalent (tce), up by 5.92% from \n2007. In 2008, its coal consumption was 79.5 million tons, up by 2.53% from 2007. In the same \nperiod, Yunnan's energy-intensity was 1.562 tce per CNY10,000, or 1.42 times the national \naverage,  ranking  Yunnan  21st  among  30  provinces  and  municipalities.10 Rapid  industrial \ndevelopment and urbanization in Yunnan have caused serious pollution and environmental \ndegradation. In 2008, Yunnan's emissions were 501,700 tons of sulfur dioxide, down by 6.0% \nfrom 2007; 831.6 billion cubic meters of flue gas, up by 2.9% from 2007; 280,500 tons of \nchemical oxygen demand, down by 3.29% from 2007; and 79.86 million tons of industrial solid \nwaste, up by 12.5% from 2007. Among these four indicators, only sulfur dioxide emission \nreduction  achieved  the  national  average.  It  is  expected  that  1%  of  energy  efficiency \nenhancement can reduce 1.5 million tons of CO  emissions in Yunnan Province. \n2\n \n6.  The  Yunnan  provincial  government  (YPG)  has  recognized  that  the  current  energy-\nintensive development path is neither economically desirable nor environmentally sustainable \nand is considering a transition to a low-carbon one. However, it faces several challenges for \nlack of (i) capacity or familiarity with international best practices to improve energy efficiency;   (ii) \ninvestment  or  suitable  financing  instruments;  (iii)  energy  conservation  awareness  among \nindustrial enterprises, which do not see much incentive to save energy; or (iv) a comprehensive \ndevelopment  strategy  that  could  guide  it  toward  balancing  economic  development  and \nenvironmental protection. Based on successful energy efficiency improvement interventions in \nother large energy intensive provinces, ADB is well positioned to provide such assistance to \nhelp  the  YPG  comprehensively  analyze  these  issues  and  recommend  a  low-carbon \ndevelopment strategy.11  \n \n7.  Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, currently contributes 28.2% of provincial GDP \nand  30.2%  of  provincial  industrial  production.12 In  2006,  five  energy-intensive  industries \nconsumed 8.1 million tce and accounted for 85% of energy consumption in Kunming. These five \nenergy-intensive industries are (i) iron and steel, consuming 3.09 million tce and accounting for \n33.7% of total energy consumption in Kunming; (ii) power generation, 1.61 million tce and \n                                                 \n6  A carbon sink is a natural or artificial feature, such as a forest, that absorbs and stores carbon, thereby removing it \nfrom the atmosphere.  \n7  President Hu Jintao made this declaration at the 15th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.  \n8  The announcement was made on 26 November 2009 as PRC's commitment to global climate change issues.   \n9  Yunnan Bureau of Statistics. 2009.

In Strategy 2020,14 ADB identified energy as a core operational sector and achieving \nenvironmental sustainability as a priority. ADB has introduced new initiatives to augment its \nassistance  to  developing  member  countries  for  acquiring  low-carbon  technologies  and \nimplementing  energy  efficiency  projects.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC15 \nemphasizes balanced and sustainable growth with more efficient use of resources and more \nstringent protection of the environment. One of the key priorities of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan \nis to improve energy efficiency by 20%, which is a flagship program of the PRC to address \nclimate change and environmental challenges arising from rapid economic growth. The TA is a \nclose fit with ADB and PRC priorities. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced energy security with lower CO  emissions in \n2\nYunnan  Province.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  the  improved  capacity  of  provincial \ngovernmental agencies in developing a low-carbon economy.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The successful implementation of the TA is expected to deliver three outputs:  \n \n(i)   an  investigation  of  energy  consumption,  energy  efficiency,  and  the \npotential  to  reduce  CO   emissions  from  the  five  energy-intensive \n2\nindustries  of  iron  and  steel,  power  generation,  chemicals,  building \nmaterials, and non-ferrous metals;  \n(ii)   a draft strategy and prioritized action plan to enhance energy efficiency \nand reduce emissions; and \n(iii)   training and information dissemination.  \n \n11.  For  output  1,  consultants  will  review  the  status  of  energy  consumption  by  the  five \nenergy-intensive  industries  and  the  existing  structural,  policy,  organizational,  and  financing \nsetup of the selected industries. For output 2, the consultants will estimate the potential for \nsaving  energy  and  reducing  CO   emissions  from  the  five  energy-intensive  industries  and \n2\ncompare  them  with  international  and  national  standards.  Based  on  these  analyses,  the \nconsultants will develop an applicable strategy and prioritized action plan to enhance energy \nefficiency  and  reduce  emissions  to  promote  low-carbon  energy  development  in  Yunnan \nProvince. For output 3, the consultants will introduce international and national experience in \nrelated areas and evaluate its relevance to Yunnan. The consultants will present their findings in \nworkshops and organize training. Lessons in Kunming will be summarized and disseminated to \nother cities in Yunnan.  \n \n \n                                                 \n13  Yunnan  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department.  2006.

The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.16 YPG will finance the balance of the \ncost, equivalent to $100,000, in the form of office accommodation, logistics, and remuneration of \ncounterpart staff. The Government assured the fact-finding mission that counterpart services, \nfacilities,  and  funds  would  be  available  as  required  according  to  the  TA  implementation \nschedule. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The  YPG  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the  Yunnan  Provincial  Environmental \nProtection  Department  (YEPD)  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  YEPD  has  already \ndesignated  officials  to  manage  the  TA  and  help  coordinate  other  governmental  agencies. \nConsulting firms will be invited to submit simplified technical proposals, and a consulting firm will \nbe engaged using quality- and cost-based selection at a ratio of 80:20 in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Two international \nconsultants (an energy specialist and an energy economist for 4 person-months combined) and \nsix  national  consultants  (two  energy  specialists,  two  energy  economists,  an  environment \nspecialist, and a training specialist for 25 person-months combined) are the estimated needs. \nSimilar expertise is required of international and national consultants in their respective areas. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n14.  Training, seminars, and workshops will be administered through consulting services. \nConsultants are expected to provide training materials, and important topics will be highlighted \nduring workshops and seminars. Consultants are required to summarize seminars, workshops, \nand training results and report to the YPG and ADB. Office equipment financed under the TA \nwill  be  procured  through  the  YPG  using  the  shopping  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  equipment  will  be \ntransferred  to  the  YPG  after  TA  completion.  To  facilitate  TA  implementation,  an  advance \npayment  facility  is  requested,  and  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.17 Wherever  necessary,  external  resource \npersons will be hired to provide specific training to a diverse group of industries and end users.   \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months from December 2009 to April 2011. The \nconsultants will be required to submit (i) an inception report within 1 month after signing the \nconsulting contract, (ii) a midterm report 6 months after signing the consulting contract, (iii) a \ndraft final report 1 month before TA completion, and (iv) a final report within 1 month after \nreceiving feedback from ADB and the YPG on the draft final report. All reports will be written in \nEnglish and translated into Chinese. Progress reports will address the terms of reference with \ndetails appropriate to that stage of the TA. The consultants will maintain close working relations \nwith ADB and the YPG. Tripartite meetings of ADB staff, the YPG, and the consultants will be \nheld periodically to provide guidance to the consultants and review their reports.  \n \nIV.
