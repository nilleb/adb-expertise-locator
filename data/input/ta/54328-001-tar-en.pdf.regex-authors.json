THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility for Unlocking the Potential for Climate \nChange- and Disaster-Resilient Multisector Provincial Projects will (i) provide project preparation \nsupport,  including  due diligence  assessment, for two  ensuing  projects, (ii)  prepare  climate \nadaptation  solutions for another two ensuing projects,1 and (iii) support project preparation \ncapacity building for provincial governments, including in the area of climate and disaster risks \nand various adaptation pathways. The TA facility is listed in the country operations business plan \nfor Viet Nam, 2021\u20132023.2  \n \n2.  Necessary  shift  from  multi-province  single  sector  approach  to  single  province \nmultisector solutions. Regulatory reforms in public investment and debt management in Viet \nNam have increased responsibilities of the provincial governments for managing and using official \ndevelopment  assistance  (ODA)  and  concessional  loans. 3  With  these  reforms,  provincial \ngovernments can no longer from benefit from \u201cumbrella projects\u201d in which a line ministry manages \na multi-province single sector project, and participating provinces are subsidiaries that are fully \ndependent, administratively and financially, on the ministry. Instead, each province is delegated \nto prepare, implement, and be accountable for investment projects for its local socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Following the central government\u2019s guidance to prepare the national midterm public \ninvestment plan for 2021\u20132025, provinces are requested to individually prepare province-based \nmultisector projects for increased synergy, efficiency, and impact of provincial public investments. \nSince 2020, ADB has received requests from several provinces for sovereign financing for single \nprovince multisector projects. Further, the need for a shift from a multi-province single sector \napproach to single-province multisector solutions is evident from ADB\u2019s operations experience in \nViet Nam. Multi-province projects tend to experience delays in project processing because the \ndifferent levels of readiness among provinces mean some provinces must wait for others to obtain the \nsame level of readiness. Differing capacity of participating provinces have exacerbated such delays.4 \n     \n3.  The single-province multisector project approach requires a shift in project team \ncomposition. Provincial multisector projects proposed by individual provinces are relatively small in \nscope and less complex in technical solutions and safeguards issues, and thus extensive international \nexpertise to support project design is not expected. Projects that cover multiple sectors at the \nprovincial level raise the issue of which sector division would lead the processing when each \nrespective sector is only a part of the project. These projects require  intensive and constant \ncoordination  among  different  ADB  sector  teams  and  between  ADB  and  the  relevant  local \ngovernments,  which  often  have  significant  constraints  in  communicating  in  foreign  languages. \nMoreover, in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, international travel \nrestrictions may constrain inputs from ADB staff and consultants based outside of Viet Nam, affecting \nproject readiness and processing schedules. To effectively and efficiently coordinate collaborative \nwork among  sector  divisions on crosscutting  development  issues  and integrated solutions for \nmultisector projects, it is deemed prudent to assign processing of single-province multisector projects \n \n1 List of Projects for Transaction Technical Assistance Facility Support (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 3). These projects are in Binh Phuoc, Hoa Binh, Nam Dinh and Tay Ninh provinces. These projects have \nbeen proposed by relevant provincial people\u2019s committees for the Prime Minister\u2019s approval.  \n2 ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2021\u20132023. Manila. The former title of this TA in the country \noperations business plan, 2021\u20132023 was the Integrated Provincial Infrastructure Facility.   \n3Such regulatory reforms include the Public Investment Law, 2019 (effective from January 2020) and Decree \n56/2020/ND-CP on the management and use of official development assistance and concessional loans (effective \nfrom May 2020).    \n4 ADB. 2020.

This arrangement will also help pursue a higher quality of \nengagement with local governments and maintain ADB\u2019s responsiveness in Viet Nam, especially in \ncases of future disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.5 Single-province multisector projects can be \neffectively processed by the VRM, where its international staff and/or national officers have adequate \ncapacity to lead project processing, with (i) outposted sector staff as co-lead and/or mentor, (ii) \nspecialized expertise and quality control provided by ADB headquarters staff, and (iii) respective \nsector directors\u2019 oversight. The VRM is prepared to deploy VRM in-house capacity for project \nprocessing,  including  procurement,  safeguards,  economic  and  financial  analysis  and  financial \nmanagement due diligence as required, and explore opportunities to mobilize locally-based qualified \ninternational and national consultants to reduce the risks of project processing delays from possible \ncontinued disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated project processing costs. \n \n4.  Need for support to provincial governments to identify climate adaptation  solutions. \nViet Nam is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, highly exposed to multiple \nclimate-related hazards such as floods, typhoons, and droughts.6 There are urgent needs to scale \nup  climate  change  and  disaster  resilient  investments  to  help  steer  economic  growth.  The \ngovernment has put in place robust legislation, strategies, and plans, including the National \nStrategy on Natural Disaster Prevention, Control, and Mitigation to 2020; the National Strategy \non Climate Change; and the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan.7 These directions are in \nline with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority of tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.8 National policies require all \nprovinces to develop their respective plans and associated investments, making it critical to \nsupport  provincial  governments  in  strengthening  their  climate  change  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement plans, and more importantly, designing investment projects that help strengthen \nprovincial resilience with feasible adaptation  solutions.  \n \n5.  Need  for  expertise  and  capacity  development  in  preparing  projects.  While \nresponsibilities in mobilizing and managing ODA and concessional resources for provincial \nsocioeconomic development have been strongly decentralized to provinces, most provincial \ngovernments have limited capacity to prepare projects that meet the requirements for financing \nby external development partners, including ADB. Provincial investment feasibility studies often \nlack, among others, technical viability assessment with technological innovations and green \nsolutions; financial and economic analysis; environmental impact examinations; social impacts \nassessment on resettlement, gender, poverty reduction, and disadvantaged groups of people, \nincluding  ethnic  minorities;  climate  and  disaster  risk  analysis;  and  institutional  capacity \nassessment  in  procurement,  financial  management,  and  project  management.  In  addition, \ngovernment regulations  on  processing ODA  and  concessional  loan-funded  projects  do  not \nprovide detailed guidelines on preparing project documents and submission checklists, causing \nconfusion  and  misunderstanding  among  project  proposing  agencies  and  delays  in  project \nappraisal and approval processes. Provincial governments\u2019 limited capacity in complying with \nboth ADB and government project processing requirements has significantly prolonged the \nprocessing schedules of ADB-funded projects.  \n \n \n5  ADB. 2020.

The national TA \nfacility approach is suitable for Viet Nam because it will support various provinces to identify \npotential single-province multisector projects and design specific projects for potential ADB \nfinancing.  The  TA  packages  for  each  of  these  provinces  are  expected  to  have  similar \nimplementation arrangements: The TA facility approach, therefore, will enhance the efficiency \nand effectiveness of ADB resources by mobilizing the same consultants to address common \nissues faced across provinces. Using a common pool of consultants will also create synergies \nand thus foster knowledge sharing and transfer across provinces. Finally, the TA facility approach \nwill reduce transaction costs compared to separate, stand-alone transaction TA projects for \nindividual provinces, especially in the context of Viet Nam where government procedures for \nprocessing a transaction TA are particularly complex and lengthy.9  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Due diligence assessments for ensuing projects prepared. The TA facility \nwill prioritize support to two single-province multi-sector projects (footnote 1). The TA facility will \nprovide consultants to support due diligence assessments for these two investment projects for \npotential ADB financing, including  the assessment of technical viability and suitability of the \nproposed solutions, economic and financial viability and sustainability, governance associated with \ninstitutional capacity (e.g., financial management, procurement, and policy), environmental and \nsocial safeguards, climate risk and adaptation assessment, and disaster risk assessment. The TA \nfacility will also identify risks and take risk-mitigating measures to further strengthen the project \nimplementation capacity of the executing and implementing agencies for the ensuing investment \nprojects. Activities will include, as required: (i) economic analysis; (ii) financial analysis and financial \nmanagement  capacity  assessment;  (iii)  strategic  procurement  planning  and  procurement \nmanagement capacity assessment; (iv) risk assessment and management plans; (v) safeguards \ndue diligence on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; (vi) climate \nchange assessment; (vii) gender analysis, including labor-related analysis and action plan; and (viii) \npoverty and social analysis, including labor-related analysis and strategy. \n \n8.   Output 2: Climate adaptation solutions for ensuing projects identified. The TA \nfacility will help strengthen the design of two selected provincial projects (footnote 1) to build \nprovincial  climate  and  disaster  resilience  in line with provincial priorities identified in their \nrespective climate change adaptation and/or disaster risk management plans. The TA facility will \nprovide consultants to undertake provincial climate and disaster risk assessments to identify \nadaptation  pathways,  prioritize  multisectoral  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk \nreduction interventions for strengthening resilience, and propose adaptation solutions including \nboth structural solutions (green, grey, and hybrid infrastructure) and non-structural support \nmeasures.  The TA facility will also provide selected government officials with necessary training \non climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, especially to share knowledge on \nnovel resilience measures, such as nature-based solutions.     \n \n9.  Output 3: Provincial capacity in preparing ensuing projects improved. The TA facility \nwill provide training workshops on project preparation skills and project processing procedures \nfor  ODA  and  concessional  loan-funded  projects,  following  aligned  government  and  ADB \nstandards and business processes (footnote 10), for the selected provinces with ensuing projects \npotentially funded by ADB (footnote 1). Project preparation skills will focus on participatory \nconsultation  approaches,  financial  and  economic  analysis,  strategic  procurement  planning, \nsafeguard  and  labor  issue  screening,  institutional  capacity  assessment,  climate  change \n \n9 Pursuant to Decree 56/2020/ND-CP on the management and use of ODA and concessional loans, the processing of \na transaction technical assistance project requires two submissions to the Prime Minister for approval.  \n \n  ", "4   \n   \n   \nassessment, poverty and social analysis, and gender analysis, among others. The training on \nproject processing procedures will primarily target the government\u2019s detailed business processes \nand specific requirements for government approval of project proposals, project investment policy \nreport, and project feasibility study. Targeted trainees may include provincial government officials \n(and provincial consultants) who would be directly involved in appraising and processing potential \nADB-funded projects. International and/or national experts and staff with relevant technical \nexpertise from ADB and central government agencies, including the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, Ministry of Finance, and State Bank of Viet Nam, will be invited to be resource \npersons for these training programs. Modalities of training and workshops will depend on the \nCOVID-19 pandemic situation. If a face-to-face modality is not feasible, virtual media will be used. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources)  and  (ii) \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.10 The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility will be replenished from time to time as funds are \nrequired and as additional projects are identified. \n \n11.  The  government  will  provide  in-kind  contributions  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \ncounterpart staff\u2019s travel costs for TA facility-related work, access to existing reports and data, \nand other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA facility does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA facility and will administer and implement the \nTA  facility  through  the  VRM  of  the  Southeast  Asia  Department  in  coordination  with  the \ndepartment\u2019s sector divisions and other relevant departments.11  \n13.  Activities under output 1 will start only after (i) the government approves the project proposal \nfor the ensuing project or ADB reaches an agreement with the relevant provincial government to \ncommence the activities and (ii) ADB approves the project concept paper of the ensuing project. \nConsulting services for each ensuing project will start only after an agreement with the respective \nprovincial  government  on  the  scope  of  assignments,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants, \nimplementation arrangements, and schedules, among other things, have been confirmed.  \n14.  The scope of the TA facility is expected to be expanded to support additional projects and \nprovinces as identified during ADB\u2019s upcoming country programming missions. The TA facility \nimplementation period is 5 years from the date of TA facility effectiveness.  \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the following table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2022\u2013December 2026   \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \n \n10 Established by ADB.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.12 Consultants will \nbe engaged through two selection methods: quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) (90:10) and \nindividual consultant selection. The QCBS packages will provide consulting for project preparation \nsupport (output 1) and will be procured in two steps. First, five to seven consulting firms will be \nselected as prequalified consultants that are eligible to submit proposals for the preparation of all \nensuing projects under the TA facility. Second, once a project concept is approved, relevant \nshortlisted consultants will be invited to submit proposals to prepare that project following QCBS \nprocedure. Individual consultants to implement certain activities under output 1 and all activities \nunder output 2, and resource persons to support training activities under output 3 will be engaged \nfollowing the individual consultant selection method.   \n \nE.  Governance  \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency, and thus the financial management, procurement, and \nintegrity risks during the TA facility implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA facility \nwill conduct thorough risk assessments of these governance areas for ensuing investment projects.  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.
