The first \ntranche is classified category C for all safeguards in accordance \nwith this framework. \n   \nInvestment Program  The  investment  program  is  the  first  targeted  intervention  to \nDescription  promote energy efficiency, improve environmental sustainability, \nand  improve  safety  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ntransport sector operations and in the PRC transport sector. This \nwill  be  implemented  on  the  PRC  railway  network  in  the \nsouthwestern PRC\u2014a poor and underserved area of the PRC \nconsisting of Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces, \nand Chongqing Municipality\u2014over the next 7 years (2009\u20132016). \nThe investment program is a priority investment included in the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan of the Government, 2006\u20132010, and the \nstimulus package announced in October 2008. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  This  is  the  first  time  the  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF) \nFacility  modality will be used in the PRC transport sector. The investment \nprogram will be implemented in the less developed southwestern \nregion, an area that is supported by ADB, and will form a part of \nthe  government\u2019s  railway  development  plan  and  its  stimulus \npackage. Options for possible financing modalities were explored. \nThe use of the MFF modality is considered the most appropriate \nfor financing this investment program given the need to finance \nmultiple projects under an investment program, provide flexible \ntranche financing requirements to suit the readiness of individual \nprojects, have long-term engagement; and the strong institutional \ncapacity of the Ministry of Railways (MOR), the executing agency. \nThe proposed MFF provides flexibility to the government and to \nADB. Since the development plan will be implemented over the \nnext 7 years, the government can submit the periodic financing \nrequest  (PFR)  when  the  projects  are  ready  to  use  these \nequipment  and  materials;  and  this  can  be  matched  with  the \navailability of funds on the ADB side. The framework approach \nprovided  an  opportunity  for  streamlining  domestic  procedures. \nThe  investment  program,  to  be  implemented  over  the  next  7 \nyears,  reflects  a  medium-  to  long-term  engagement.  The ", "ii   \ninvestments will be supported by a sustained medium-term policy \ndialogue in the areas of improving energy efficiency, enhancing \nrailway  safety,  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and \ncapacity development. These will be supported by providing a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant. \n   \nRationale  MOR will implement a plan for railway development (2009\u20132016) \nat a cost of about $25 billion for capacity expansion over the \nsouthwestern region of the PRC. This includes activities such as \nnew  construction,  double  tracking,  electrification,  and \nrehabilitation. Within this plan, one option was to support railway \nconstruction or capacity expansion as has been done in the past \nand another option was to support targeted areas such as energy \nefficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety,  which  are \ncritically important areas for PRC railway sector and where ADB\u2019s \ncontribution could be clearly distinguished. Within this plan, ADB \nidentified an investment program of $3.24 billion to support these \nthree areas, for which it will provide support of $1 billion through \nthe proposed MFF. The cost of the equipment is small compared \nto the cost of other capital assets or construction of a railway line, \nbut their benefits are significant and it is easy to integrate them \nwhen the government is implementing the development plan. This \nwould  have  high  value  added  with  a  smaller  investment, \nleveraging much more value addition. \n \n  The proposed investment program is consistent with two of the \nfour pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC: \n(i) inclusive growth and balanced development, and (ii) resource \nefficiency  and  environmental  sustainability.  The  investment \nprogram  reflects  (i)  network  development,  which  will  enhance \ncapacity and reduce bottlenecks; (ii) improved energy efficiency \nand environmental sustainability by providing a more efficient and \nenvironment-friendly  mode  of  transport  in  the  southwestern \nregion; (iii) enhanced safety through the provision of a reliable and \nsafe  mode  of  transport;  (iv) support  for  the  PRC  railway \ndevelopment plan and the western region development strategy; \nand  (v) promotion  of  pro-poor  economic  growth  in  the  region, \nthereby reducing poverty. The investment program will emphasize \nenergy  conservation,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety \nthrough the introduction of safe and reliable technology on the \nrailway network, which will result in improved reliability, higher \nmobility, increased network capacity, optimal use of the network \nand assets, and increased staff productivity. All of these will lead \nto higher efficiency of the railway network.  \n \n  The investment program will be implemented in the southwestern \nPRC, a relatively poor area. The region is largely mountainous \nwith  abundant  natural  reserves  of  coal,  and  other  nonferrous \nmaterials; and famous tourist sites. In spite of abundant natural \nresources,  many  people  are  poor  and  the  economic  growth \nnecessary to reduce rural poverty has been insufficient because \n ", "  iii\nof  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  costs.  The  railway \ndensity in the southwestern region is the lowest in the PRC, and \nlocal governments and people living in the southwestern region \nsee the railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. \nRailway development is part of the government\u2019s program for the \nintegrated  development  of  transportation  facilities  in  this  poor \nregion  and  MOR  plans  to  develop  6,500  kilometers  (km)  of \nrailways  in  the  southwestern  region  by  2015.  The  proposed \nsouthwestern  region  also  shares  borders  with  Viet  Nam,  and \nYunnan and Guangxi provinces are part of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. The development of railways is expected to play an \nimportant  role  in  facilitating  and  integrating  this  poor  and \nunderdeveloped  region,  and  stimulating  regional  and \ninterprovincial  trade  and  movement  of  people.  The  investment \nprogram  is  a  priority  investment  included  in  the  government\u2019s \nproposed Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the stimulus package. It is \nalso in line with the Railway Development Plan and supports the \ngovernment\u2019s western region development strategy. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  proposed  investment  program  will  be  an \nimproved transport system in the region that supports sustainable \nsocioeconomic development and the western region development \nstrategy. Providing economic railway transportation in unserved, \nless  developed,  and  poor  areas  will  create  conditions  for \ndeveloping local resources, employment opportunities, and higher \nincomes; and thus raise living standards in the project area. The \noutcome of the investment program will be an energy-efficient, \nsafe,  reliable,  affordable,  and  environment-friendly  railway \ntransport system developed in the southwestern region. \n   \nInvestment Plan   The  tentative  program  investment  cost  is  estimated  at \n$3.24 billion, including taxes and duties. The total cost includes \nprice  contingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges  during \nimplementation. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource Total  % \nInvestment Program     \nAsian Development Bank  1,000.00  30.88 \nMinistry of Railways  2,238.50  69.12 \nTotal  3,238.50  100.00 \nFirst Tranche \nAsian Development Bank  300.00  31.01 \nMinistry of Railways  667.34  68.99 \nTotal  967.34  100.00 \nSource: Ministry of Railways. \n    \n ", "iv   \nMultitranche Financing  The  MFF  will  provide  up  to  $1.00  billion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \nFacility Amount and  capital resources, with final terms and conditions to be established \nTerms  under  individual  loan  agreements  based  on  prevailing  ADB \npolicies. The financing will be subject to interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based \nlending facility, the applicable commitment charge, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the related loan agreements. The \ngovernment  has  the  flexibility  to  choose  between  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes most suitable for each loan. \nADB provides flexibility in terms of repayment and interest rate \nswaps  during  the  financing  period  in  accordance  with  the \nframework  financing  agreement,  relevant  loan  regulations,  and \ndraft loan agreements. Currency schedules can be structured in \nline with the specific needs of individual loans. \n   \nAdvance Contracting and  Because of the urgency of implementing the stimulus package, \nRetroactive Financing  the government has requested approval of advance contracting \nand retroactive financing of up to 20% of the first loan proceeds, \nfor  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  for  but  not  earlier  than \n12 months before the date of the loan agreement. This request \nwas approved on 9 September 2009. The government has been \ninformed that provision of advance contracting and procurement \nand retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \ntranches.  For  subsequent  tranches,  retroactive  financing  of \notherwise eligible expenditures may be considered and allowed by \nADB  Management  when  included  in  a  PFR.  Total  retroactive \nfinancing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the \nindividual  loan  and  must  have  been  incurred  not  more  that \n12 months before the signing of the related legal agreements. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The investment program will be implemented over 7 years. The \nnumber of PFRs will be from three to six. The disbursement of the \nfirst PFR is expected to be completed by 30 June 2016. The \ndisbursement of the last tranche will be completed no later than \n30 June 2017. \n   \nExecuting Agency and  MOR  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  the  overall \nImplementation  investment  program  implementation.  The  Foreign  Capital  and \nArrangements  Technical Import Center, under MOR, will coordinate the project \nmanagement office\u2019s tasks and be responsible for procurement, \nwithdrawals,  and  reporting  in  relation  to  ADB.  A  steering \ncommittee, headed by the director general of the Foreign Capital \nand Technical Import Center, will be responsible for the selection \nof  projects  for  subsequent  financing  by  ADB,  and  their \nimplementation. Staff employed will be experienced in technical, \nfinancial, and administrative matters; and implementing projects \nfinanced by international financial institutions.  \n   \n ", "  v\nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the MFF ADB loan will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan for \neach tranche will be discussed and finalized during the fact-finding \nmission for the respective tranche.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  investment  program  will  (i) reduce  fuel  consumption  and \nBeneficiaries  enhance energy efficiency, enabling the PRC to save valuable \nforeign  exchange,  (ii)  improve  the  environment  and  reduce \npollution; (iii) enhance railway safety, enabling railway users to \nbenefit from lower transport costs; (iv) increase the line capacity, \nbenefiting  consumers  and  producers  of  goods  and  services \nthrough the provision of timely and efficient transport services and \nlower logistics costs; and (v) improve staff productivity, enabling \nrailway users to benefit from lower costs.  \n \n  The major project beneficiaries will be (i) the government, which \nwill benefit from improved safety, reduced economic losses, and a \nreduced  energy  bill;  (ii)  passengers,  who  will  benefit  from \naffordable, environment-friendly, faster, and safer trips; (iii) freight \nshippers, who will benefit from reduced damage to shipments and \nmore affordable, faster, and safer trips; and (iv) private sector who \nwill  benefit  from  new  business  and  job  opportunities  and \nenhanced economic competitiveness. \n \n  Railway  development  generates  job  opportunities  (skilled  and \nunskilled)  for  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  women,  and  other \nvulnerable  groups,  which  helps  develop  their  job  skills.  Job \nopportunities will provide potential new sources of income for local \nresidents. An increase in female participation in the labor and \ntourism  market  increases  women\u2019s  net  income  and  savings, \nimproves  overall  family  welfare,  and  helps  improve  women\u2019s \nstatus. Women and other vulnerable groups benefit from railway \ndevelopment and have equal access to employment and wages. \nRailway  development  generates  demand  for  local  labor  and \nincreases worker productivity and wages. Expansion of secondary \nand  tertiary  industries  helps  generate  additional  employment \nopportunities for both men and women, close to their homes.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The investment program is formulated to minimize potential risks. \nSensitivity  tests  indicate  that  there  would  have  to  be  a  sharp \ndeterioration  in  economic  circumstances  for  the  investment \nprogram to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in \nimplementation,  which  would  delay  the  realization  of  benefits. \nMOR has successfully implemented ADB-financed projects. Risks \nassociated with potential changes in government policy for railway \ndevelopment are minimal. An analysis of the demand for railway \ntransport  shows  that  the  southwestern  PRC  needs  additional \nrailway transport capacity to sustain its economic development. \nMacroeconomic conditions  are expected to continue to be sound, \n ", "vi   \n  with  continuing  political  stability  in  the  PRC.  Strong  economic \nperformance is expected in the southwestern PRC based on the \ngovernment\u2019s projections and its growth trends. \n   \nThe  equipment  and  materials  to  be  procured  and  included  in \ntranche  1  are  based  on  proven  and  established  technologies. \nMOR has experience of installing new technologies successfully \nand these can be implemented within a relatively short time. For \nsubsequent tranches, equipment and material with similar proven \nenergy efficiency, environmental benefits, and safety benefits will \nbe used. Thus, the technical risks of the investment program are \nminimal.  \n \n  Successful implementation requires sound project management. \nMOR  has  strong  implementation  experience  and  adequate \ncapacity. The innovative design of the investment program will \nnecessitate  additional  training,  and  supplemental  TA  support \nprovided by ADB would further assist MOR in strengthening its \ncapacity.  MOR  agreed  to  provide  counterpart  support  for  TA \nimplementation. The key MOR personnel are well experienced in \nADB project implementation.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  government  has  requested  TA  support  for  institutional \ndevelopment and enhancing staff capacity with MOR and railway \nadministration. A TA grant of $600,000 from the TA Special Fund-\nOthers is proposed to support the government\u2019s request. The TA \nwill (i) review the existing institutional arrangements for integrating \nenergy  efficiency  and  environmental  issues  in  railway \nmanagement  and  operation,  compare  these  in  developed \ncountries, identify the gaps, and make recommendations for MOR \nto  implement;  (ii) undertake  safety  and  energy  audits  of  a \nnominated  railway  administration,  identifying  areas  where \nimprovements can be made; and (iii) undertake capacity building \nprograms to familiarize staff and create awareness about energy \nefficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety.  \n \n ", "100 o 00'E M O N G O L I A 120 o 00'E\nINNER   MONGOLIA\nRAILWAY ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nAND SAFETY ENHANCEMENT Jining\nHEBEI\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM Baotou\nHohhot\nto Urumqi PEOPLE'S REINP UTHBELIC OF CHINDHoAunagnsgh Heneg(Yellow River)Datong BEIJING Qinhuangdao\nTIANJIN\nShuoxian\nYumen Yinchuan Shenmu North Bazhou Tianjin BSoehaai\nHuanghua\nSHENMU--YAN'AN RAILWAY Yuanping Shijiazhuang\nYulin Taiyuan\nZhongwei Hengshui Yantai\nYuci Dezhou\nGantang Suide\nNINGXIA Mucun SHANXI Shehe Jinan\nSHANDONG\nXining TAIYUAN--ZHONGWEI RAILWAY Xiaoyi Tunilu Fengteng JING--JIU RAILWAY Qingdao 35 o 00'N\nQINGHAI Lanzhou\nYan\u2019an North\n35 o 00'N SHANXI--XIAOLIU RAILWAY Hancheng YuLeinshfeannJiaozuoXin Xiang Heze YanLzihnoyui ShijiuYsueollow  Sea\nZhongjiacun TongguanHouma Zhengzhou Xuzhou Lianyungang\nGANSU Baoji Xinfeng HENAN Shangqiu XinyiJIANGSU\nXi'an Qingling Tunnel\nHEFEI--XI'AN RAILWAY ZHENGZHOU--XI'AN RAILWAY Huaiyuan\nLANZHOU--CHSOINCGHQUINAGN RAILWAY YangDpianxgiagSnuaHnAAADnNAkaXXnIIAgND-a-SWnhAjaiaNnGnXgugInAckaNhon euRXnAgiIaLnWTogAnfYXgabinxaii a MLNHoisuaUnhntaaByXinnaEisanHIogluinaXningycahFnuugaynDaManbiaeg  c MhoeunLtnaHuign'seafnei CBhWaennugghfbueungNYaiHxnijaninngganYaWJnigauSpnxHiigNnSyAgaihnnNatoGnngHghAaiI\nWanzhou (Wanxian) Jingmen ANHUI Changxing\nCHONGQING-C-LhICeHnUgAdNu RAILWAY CHONGQING Lichua(nYangtze RiverY)ichang HWaunhkaonu HEFAEIn--qJiInUgJIANG RAILWAY HNainnggbzohou\nNeijiang ChongFquilningg Huaiyuan YICHANG--WANZHOU RAILWAY Jiujiang ZHEJIANG\nScenic Area\nNanchang\nYibin\nDALI--LIJIANG RAILWAY Changsha Xiangtang Yiyang Wenzhou\nZhongdian Chang  Jiang Loudi Sanjiangcheng Yingtan\nLijiang GUIZHOU--SHUIBAI RAILWAY GUIZHOU Huaihua HUNAZhNuzhou Ji'an JIANGXI FUJIAN\nLanping\nDukuo Liupanshui Henyang Nanping 25 o 00'N\nFuzhou\nZhanyi BaiguGouiyang Guiding Ganzhou GANZHOU--LONGYAN RAILWAY\nDali Hongguo Pingzha\n2B5 oa 0o0s'hNan Chuxiong KunmiQnugjing Weishe LuochenGguilin Dingnan Longyan Xiamen\nYUNNAN Yiliang Hechi GUANGXI Meizhou Zhangzhou\nSancha Longchuan\nLincang Liuzhou GUANGDONG\nKaiyuan Heshan Laibin Chaozhou\nShiping Guangzhou\nMohei Litang Sanshui Shantou\nNanning Yunfu YaCoghuangping Shenzhen GUANG--MEI--SHANR AILWAY\nJinghong Ping XiangFangQchineznhgou Hepu Hechun ZMMhauAchCaauiAU SARKHoOwNloGo nKONG SAR\nVIET NAM Beihai Zhakou Maoming\nInvestment Program Area\nLAO PEOPLE'S Zhanjiang YAOGU--MAOMING RAILWAY\nNational Capital\nDEMOCRATIC\nSantang Provincial Capital\nREPUBLIC Yangpu\nCity/Town\nHaikou\nNada Existing Railway\nChahe\nShilu Planned Railway\nBasou HAINAN\nADB--Financed Railway Projects\nSanya\nN Completed\nUnder Construction\nSouth   China   Sea\nRiver\n0 50 100150200250\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nKilometers\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n100 o 00'E 120 o 00'E\n09-2696 HR", " \nI.

Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2008, \nthe PRC has experienced sustained rapid economic growth that has resulted in a rapid increase \nin  demand  for  transportation.  Annual  growth  in  passenger  transport  was  9%  and  freight \ntransport grew at 7.6% during 1978\u20132008. Railway is the principal mode of freight transport in \nthe PRC. In 2008, the modal split for freight ton-kilometers (km) was 45.2% for railways, \nfollowed by 29.6% for inland waterways and seashore shipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for \npipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  In  2008,  road  traffic  accounted  for  53.3%  of  total \npassenger-km, followed by railways with 33.4%, civil aviation with 12.9%, and coastal and \ninland waterways with 3.5%. \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of long-distance and bulk transport. At the end of 2008, \nthe  PRC\u2019s  79,700  route-km  of  railways  comprised  64,000  km  of  national  railways  and \n15,700 km of joint venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) runs the state-\nowned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local railways, regional \nlines within provincial boundaries, are built under provincial government or MOR sponsorship to \nserve local needs and interconnect with the national railway network. Despite its large size, \nhowever, the railway network does not provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population \nand land area.1  \n \n4.  PRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and the second \nhighest passenger transport density after Japan. Locomotive turnover is the highest in the world. \nFrom 1978 to 2008, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,482 billion ton-km, or \nby 5.25% yearly, and passenger traffic grew by 6.74% yearly, from 109 billion passenger-km to \n778 billion passenger-km. For passenger trips, the average railway journey increased from \n134 km in 1978 to 536 km in 2008, compared with road travel, which grew from 35 km to 56 km \nover the same period. For freight, the average railway journey in 2008 was 778 km, compared \nwith 69 km for road transport. Yet, despite such growth rates, railway capacity has lagged \nbehind demand because of constraints in the system.2 Given the railway\u2019s important role in \nproviding economic transportation, these constraints will need to be removed. The Government \nof the PRC has therefore adopted an aggressive plan to improve the railways, and has planned \nnetwork expansion and capacity enhancements in underserved areas.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square kilometers of land is one-third that of India and one-tenth that of Japan. \n2  Between 1978 and 2007, gross domestic product (GDP) increased 67.5 times, the length of road grew 3 times, and \ncivil airlines increased 14.7 times, while the length of total railways in operation only increased 50% from \n51,700 km to 78,000 km. ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Government Strategy \n \n5.  The government\u2019s railway development policy puts emphasis on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture and local railways \nto promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices.  \n \n6.  In 2004, the State Council approved a railway development plan for the period up to \n2020, which was updated in 2008. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 120,000 km \nby 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Priority will be given to the development of \nrailways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nRoute network length in the western region of the PRC will increase by 16,000 km\u201340,000 km \nby 2020. To improve operating efficiency, MOR has begun to separate passenger and freight \ntrains on key rail corridors.3  \n \n7.  The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11th FYP), 2006\u20132010, highlights railway development \nand accelerated railway construction. It foresees (i) the construction of 17,000 km of new lines \nfor a total network length of 92,000 route-km, and (ii) the conversion of 45% of the network \nlength into double-track electrified railway. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated passenger \nrailway network through the construction of 7,000 km of passenger-dedicated lines by 2010; \n(ii) develop coal transport corridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand \nthe railway network in the poor western region (to 34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at \nthe  southwest  and  northwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container \nnetwork.  A  total  investment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  (about  $200 billion)\u2014CNY1.25  trillion  for \nconstruction and CNY250 billion for rolling stock\u2014is planned in the 11th FYP, of which a total of \nCNY765.2 billion has been spent in 2006, 2007, and 2008 (Appendix 3). \n \n8.  In  view  of  the  downturn  in  the  international  economy,  the  government  adopted  an \naggressive plan to boost internal demand and consumption, and declared a stimulus package in \nOctober 2008. The stimulus package emphasizes railway development. For 2009\u20132012, a total \ninvestment of CNY1.5 trillion is envisaged for railway development in poor, unserved areas\u2014\nparticularly  in  the  western  region. 4 These  investments  would  include  new  construction, \nupgrading of existing lines, double tracking, electrification, and upgrading and building new \nterminals. Given this background, the government requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide an investment program to support railway development in the less developed \nsouthwestern region.5 ADB proposes to provide this support by use of the MFF modality, which \nwill be used for the first time in the PRC transport sector.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB is financing the first passenger-dedicated corridor under ADB. 2005.

Manila (Loan 2182-PRC). \n4  MOR plans to invest a total of CNY600 billion in 2009 for railway development; 40% of this investment is proposed \nto be invested in the western region. This capital spending on railways is estimated to eventually boost GDP \ngrowth by 1.5 percentage points and create 6 million jobs. \n5  The  southwestern  PRC  consists  of  Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan  provinces;  and  Chongqing \nMunicipality.  \n ", "3 \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy, Sector Experience, and Development Coordination \n \n9.  The ADB strategy for the railway sector is centered on helping (i) expand the railway \nsystem by constructing new lines in unserved and less developed areas, (ii) modernize railways \nand increase safety and capacity to improve efficiency on key routes, (iii) promote energy \nconservation and environmental sustainability, (iv) commercialize railway operations to sustain \nefficient operations, and (v) increase railway competitiveness in the transport sector through \nrestructuring and reform. ADB, the lead development partner in the PRC railway sector, is \nsupporting the development of railways in poor, less developed inland provinces to promote \nsustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.6 ADB has provided 17 loans totaling about \n$3.5 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by \njoint ventures with MOR, 6,620 km of new railway lines under the eight national railway projects, \nand a sector-wide intervention to improve safety on the PRC railway network. ADB assistance \nto the sector has evolved from financing civil works on local railways to supporting major \nnational corridors with much less financing but with safety, management information system, \nenvironmental, and other technological improvements. The investment program, designed to \npromote economic growth by providing railway transportation in underserved, less developed, \nand poor areas of the southwestern PRC, is consistent with PRC\u2019s development priorities and \nthe ADB strategy. \n \n10.  In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World \nBank, in addition to the ADB, have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national \nrailways.  In  the  past  20  years,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided \n\u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal \ntransport corridors. It has also financed the development of new sections of the national railway \nnetwork  in  inland  provinces.  Since  1984,  the  World  Bank  has  provided  13  loans  totaling \n$3.2 billion for 12 national railway projects and one local railway project (Appendix 5). ADB \nintroduced  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  in  2004  to  the  PRC  railway  and \ncofinanced a railway project in Yunnan. AFD provided another loan of Euro 80 million in 2005 for \nnetwork expansion. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) has provided 6 loans for Euro 604 \nmillion and US$80 million since 2005. Austria has provided a loan of Euro 30 million in 2006 and \nSpain provided a loan for Euro 80 million in 2005. US Export Import Bank has provided two loans \nof $300 million for procurement of track equipment since 2003. ADB has coordinated closely with \nother development partners on policy dialogue and shared its development experiences with \nthem. \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue \n \n11.  Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway sector and has \neffectively complemented lending operations. Since 2002, ADB has actively engaged MOR, the \nNational Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Finance in policy dialogue \nand  discussion;  and  has  reached  broad  agreement  on  reforms  as  an  engine  for  further \ndevelopment of the railways. The railway development plan defines the major goals for the PRC \nrailways to 2020, and conforms with the strategic agenda of ADB. MOR\u2019s proposed reform \nagenda under this plan involves (i) studying and learning from the best international practices, \n(ii) separating core operations from noncore transportation businesses, (iii) streamlining the staff, \n(iv) reforming the railway investment and financing system, and (v) establishing specialized \ntransportation companies.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty \nReduction. Manila. The report concluded that completed railway projects supported general economic growth and \npoverty reduction in the region served, together with small areas of higher growth and poverty reduction in towns \nserved by railway stations. \n ", "4 \n12.  MOR  has  taken  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  under  a  new \nmanagement concept\u2014the asset operating liability system\u2014MOR entered into management \ncontracts with some railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The \ncontracts helped improve operating and financial performance, and the approach was later \nextended to all the railway administrations. The separation of core and noncore businesses is a \nkey  element  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business was reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.46 million in 2008. In the \nnoncore  transportation business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2008,  MOR  had  set  up \n2,691 diversified  businesses  (independent  of  the  core  transportation  business)  employing \n304,000 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR \nbegan a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. In 2005, \nMOR completed the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, and \n181 nursery schools, as well as 260 hospitals and medical units, to local governments. One \nhundred branch lines totaling 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce \noperating losses (the reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 4). \n \n13.  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  deals  primarily  with  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the \noverarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nsustainability,  (iii) safety  improvements,  (iv)  sector  reforms,  (v)  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment, and (vi) private sector participation and nongovernment financing. Fourteen TA \ngrants  totaling  $6.6  million  have  been  provided  since  1989  for  the  development  of  the \nemergency  management  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network,  institutional  development  of \ndedicated passenger lines and local railways, tariff and organizational studies for the Jing\u2013Jiu \nrailway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment, human resource development, and improvement of financial management and \naccounting  systems  (Appendix  5).  ADB,  as  the  lead  development  partner,  continues  to \nemphasize further progress in those areas7 and coordinates closely with other development \npartners such as the AFD, KfW, and the World Bank. In recent years, ADB policy dialogue has \nemphasized enhanced safety, environmental sustainability, and energy conservation.  \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n14.  The strategic purpose of ADB involvement in the railway sector has been to create the \nconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth  that  would  help  improve  living  standards.  The \ngovernment\u2019s investment program to be implemented in the southwestern PRC, an underserved \narea, would spur economic growth through improved, energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and \ncost-effective transport access. ADB support in railway development has had an intensifying \nimpact on poverty reduction and is an integral part of project planning and design. Provisions for \n(i) the preferential hiring of poor workers, including women, for the construction and operation of \nthe proposed railways;8 (ii) the use of locally produced materials that meet the requirements of \nquality and economy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) railway station area development; (iv) the \nbuilding of station access roads and construction access roads; and (v) support for the poverty \nreduction programs of local governments9 have led to significant impact on reducing poverty in \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008. The Railways of the People\u2019s Republic of China: An Agenda for Action. Manila \n8  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the poor composed 41% of unskilled labor on average, and 64% at the \npeak of construction (ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project.

Manila). \n ", "5 \nthe project impact areas. The railway projects also finance the construction of access roads, \nwhich are handed over to the local government after they are built. The railway investment and \nthe development of local roads increase the welfare gains of the poor, including women, and \nhelp spread the project benefits to poverty villages. \n \nb.  Energy Conservation and Environmental Sustainability \n15.  Energy conservation and environmental sustainability have been important elements of \nthe ADB policy dialogue with MOR since 2006, and are identified as the two important areas of \nsustainable development in the 11th FYP of the Government (Appendix 7). ADB dialogue has \nhelped  to  create  awareness  of  these  two  issues  and  of  factors  like  energy  savings  and \nenvironmental improvements in the performance evaluation of railway administrations and other \nentities.  The  dialogue  has  encouraged  the  use  of  clean  energy  and  energy-efficient \ntechnologies  and  environmental  improvements  in  railway  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance. ADB is assisting MOR in drawing up a strategy for making the PRC railways more \nenergy-efficient.10 In  the  past,  ADB  has  encouraged  the  use  of  fuel-efficient  locomotives, \ndouble-stack container trains, \u201cgreen corridors,\u201d environment-friendly station design and waste \ndisposal; and fuel-efficient, environment-friendly, safety, and maintenance equipment as part of \nthe ADB-financed project design. This area has been of mutual interest to other development \npartners such as the AFD, KfW, and the World Bank. Close coordination has been maintained \nwith them. \n \nc.  Enhancing Safety \n16.  Safety  is  an  integral  part  of  providing  competitive,  high  quality,  and  reliable \ntransportation  for  people  and  goods.  As  PRC  railways  have  modernized,  introduced  new \nconcepts and technologies and increased speeds, safety needs have changed. The 11th FYP of \nMOR (2006\u20132010) recognizes this important aspect and seeks to promote integrated safety \nmanagement, information network security, and an emergency management system consistent \nwith the development needs of the PRC railways. It seeks to attract foreign technology and \nexpertise  to  meet  these  needs.  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  emphasizes  the  need  for \noperational reforms for the rail network, including enhancing safety in construction, operation, \nand maintenance. MOR and ADB support the safety and security objective on PRC railways \nthrough introduction of modern technologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring, and \nenforcement and outreach activities (Appendix 6). Since 2003, ADB has supported investments \nin  railway  safety  as  part  of  ADB  financing,  and  has  worked  closely  with  the  safety  and \ntransportation  departments  of  MOR  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  on  the  institutional \ninvestment  and  training  needs  for  safety  in  PRC  railways.  ADB  also  initiated  dialogue  on \nadopting a sector-wide approach on safety rather than a project-based approach. Adopting a \nsector-wide approach is consistent with the network approach adopted for railway operations in \nthe PRC; and helps in providing economies of scale and better management of emergencies, \npreventive maintenance, and accidents.  \n \n17.  Managing emergencies and crises on a technologically advanced high-speed railway \nsystem is a new concept for PRC railways, and managing such a network is different from \nmanaging the conventional railway system. MOR has limited experience in emergency and \ncrisis management, so it sought to learn from international experience and best practices. The \ngovernment  and  MOR  requested  ADB  assistance  in  researching  and  learning  from  best \ninternational practices on an emergency management system in advanced railway systems in \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.

Manila (approved on 29 February). The \nTA is ongoing. \n ", "6 \ndeveloped countries, and help in adapting them to PRC railways. ADB has provided a TA grant \nof $500,000 to help develop an emergency management system on PRC railways.11 In 2007, \nADB approved a $100 million loan for enhancing safety on the PRC railway network,12 to help \ndevelop an emergency management system on the PRC railways. \n \nd.  Sector Reforms \n18.  ADB is supporting the institutional reform of the railway sector to separate government \nand enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of \nthe railways. ADB has actively pursued (i) the separation of the core transport business from the \nnoncore transport business, (ii) the segmentation of passenger and freight services, and (iii) the \nstrengthening of the recently corporatized  specialized transportation companies. As part of \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR, three large companies handling containers, special goods, \nand express parcel have been set up.13 The establishment of passenger-dedicated corridors \nwith  a  separate  institutional  structure  is  a  key  ADB  intervention.14 With  ADB  assistance, \ninstitutional, marketing, business development, and technical standards have been worked out \nfor such initiatives; and capacity-building support was provided to officials of MOR.15 \n \n19.  The streamlining of transportation and non-transportation staff is also being pursued. On \n18  March  2005,  under  a  major  restructuring  exercise,  MOR  abolished  41 sub-railway \nadministration bureaus, thereby doing away with one tier of railway management. By the end of \n2008, the number of stations and sections had been reduced from 1,500 to 627. This move has \ntrimmed the staff by more than 22,000 and helped rationalize operations, improve productivity, \nand  increase  efficiency.  Recent  ADB  support  for  reforms  in  operations  and  railway  safety \nincludes a sector-wide intervention for the introduction of an emergency management system, \nsafe  and  reliable  technology,  improved  speeds,  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a \nmodern dispatch control system, and high-quality information systems on the PRC railway \nnetwork. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization has intensified competition \namong the different modes of transport, and the structure of transport demand is likely to \nchange.16 ADB advisory TA for policy reform support to MOR17 analyzed (i) the conflicting roles \nof meeting social obligations and making profits, (ii) the increasing modal competition, (iii) the \nimpact of fast urbanization and economic development, and (iv) the demand for better services. \nAs a lead development partner in the sector, ADB maintains close coordination with AFD, \nGerman development cooperation through KfW, and the World Bank; and has developed with \nthese institutions a common approach to reforms and assistance (Appendix 3).  \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2007.

Marketing and Business Development \n20.  As the PRC progresses toward a market-driven economy, its railways need to compete \non  the  basis  of  price  and  service  quality  for  demand-based  transportation  services.  New \nmarketing and business development initiatives are needed for both freight and passenger \nservices to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has financed project-specific studies to create \nmarketing and business development opportunities, including the skills and knowledge needed \nfor market-oriented, profitable operations. ADB has supported the development of marketing \nand business strategies for dedicated passenger lines (footnote 15), 7,000 km of which will be \ncompleted by 2010. The first dedicated passenger line from Beijing to Tianjin started operation \nin August 2008 and has adopted recommendations of this TA.  \n \nf.  Private Sector Participation \n21.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue encourages increased private sector participation in the railway \nsector. ADB provided MOR with a policy note18 to examine opportunities for diversified financing \nsources, increased private sector involvement, and public\u2013private partnerships in the PRC \nrailways sector. In 2005, MOR issued guidelines to facilitate investment and financing system \nreforms, which seek to lower the threshold of investment, encourage the private sector to invest, \nand  attract  strategic  investors  to  railway  financing.19 Strategic  and  private  investors20 are \nparticipating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project.21 The \ninitial  public  offering  for  the  Daqin  Railway  Company  (CNY15 billion)  and  the  Guangshen \nRailway Company22 (CNY10 billion) in 2006 was heavily oversubscribed. In 2007, the China \nRailway Tielong Container Logistics Company made an additional public offering of 80 million \nshares for CNY700 million. In 2008, MOR issued railway bonds of CNY80 billion, an increase of \n33% over 2007, to raise financing for railway construction. \n \n22.  Under past ADB-financed projects, corporate entities have been set up to assist in the \nconstruction, operation, and management of the project. Activities such as consulting services \nfor  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance, commercial \nactivities, industrial sidings, loading and unloading, and other logistical facilities have been \noutsourced through open competition. Private sector involvement has been encouraged in the \ndevelopment of station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. Extra large container terminals \nand container freight stations have been established at a number of locations to facilitate the \nparticipation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in  the  business  of  rail-transported \ncontainers. All of these actions will create more opportunities for private sector participation. The \nproposed investment program will provide the opportunity for the private sector to participate in \ndeveloping modern technologies, as well as supply equipment and material that are modern and \ndifferent. These will be integrated in the national railway development program. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2006.

The evaluation of ADB assistance for the PRC transport sector concluded that the ADB \nprogram for railways has been successful. 23 The evaluation noted that in the railway subsector, \nADB strategic priorities were well aligned with PRC needs. Its overall focus of building railways \nusing  modern  technologies  addressed  needs  to  increase  railway  capacity  and  reduce  the \npersistent gap between demand and supply as quickly and efficiently as possible. ADB\u2019s priority \nof  improving  efficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and  its  emphasis  on  restructuring  and \nreforming policy, was well matched to evolving institutional reforms in railways. Experience from \ncompleted and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment \nand generally satisfactory capabilities of executing agencies for project implementation. The \nspeed of implementation has generally exceeded expectations at appraisal, and agencies have \ngenerally complied with loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management were \ncarried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants were complied with in a timely manner, and the \naudited  financial  statements  were  generally  acceptable.  Of  the  17  ADB-supported  railway \nprojects, 10 have been completed and 7 are under implementation. \n \n24.  The key lessons from the completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that \nthe executing agency\u2014established for project processing, implementation, and operation\u2014has \nadequate capacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a \nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and \nother  transportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  project  facilities;  (iv) prepare  realistic \nresettlement  projections  at  appraisal;  and  (v)  finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately \ndetermined debt\u2013equity ratios. \n \n25.  Previous  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects\u2019  influence  areas.24 The  main  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  new  railway  lines  in  less \ndeveloped regions stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth rates of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and rural incomes compared with the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario;25 \n(ii) construction activities generated demand for unskilled labor and employment of poor workers, \nincluding  women,  who  would  have  otherwise  remained  unemployed  or  underemployed;26 \n(iii) service roads built for construction activities opened up and benefited rural communities in \ninaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing additional resources \nfor  social  programs27 and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and  transportation  of  local \nmaterials generated employment; (vi) improved and lower cost transport resulted in lower prices \nof agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more \nincome  to  farmers;  increased  the  mobility  of  rural  residents;  and  allowed  access  to  more \nmarkets, employment opportunities, and social services beyond the immediate communities; \n(vii) counties provided with new railway access recorded higher GDP growth rates than other \ncounties; (viii) the investment environment was enhanced, resulting in rapid development of \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2007.

Building Railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China: Changing Lives. Manila \n25 In  the  project  area  of  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway,  the  GDP  of  10  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  increased  from \nCNY4.9 billion in 1993 to CNY15.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 25.5% compared with 10.2% for the \nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n26 During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway, a total of about 7.5 million person-days of \nemployment were generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local poor people\u2014\nthereby raising them above the poverty line. \n27 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi province that are traversed by the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \nincreased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 22.7% compared with \n12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n ", "9 \nsecondary and tertiary industries that generated employment;28 (ix) the consequent shift in the \nstructure of employment from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity agroprocessing \nand light industry increased employment opportunities for women whose incomes and social \nstatus then improved;29 (x) tourism developed because of more affordable and convenient \nrailway travel; and (xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the \nprojects as agreed at appraisal, and the environmental impacts of induced developments were \naddressed in accordance with the environmental impact assessments for the projects. The \nrailway projects have contributed to a transformation of the local economies\u2014per capita rural \nincomes increased substantially, living standards improved, and poverty reduced (Appendix 8). \nThe lessons learned and experiences gained were incorporated in the current project design.  \n \n5.  Rationale \n \n26.  MOR will implement a plan for railway development (2009\u20132016) at a cost of about \n$25 billion for capacity expansion over the southwestern region of the PRC. This includes \nactivities such as new construction, double tracking, electrification, and rehabilitation. Within this \nplan, one option was to support railway construction or capacity expansion as has been done in \nthe  past;  and  another  option  was  to  support  targeted  areas  such  as  energy  efficiency, \nenvironmental sustainability, and safety, which are critically important areas for PRC railway \nsector and where ADB\u2019s contribution could be clearly distinguished (Appendixes 6 and 7). \nWithin this plan, ADB identified an investment program of $3.24 billion to support these three \nareas, for which it will provide support of $1 billion through the proposed MFF. The cost of the \nequipment is small compared to the cost of other capital assets or construction of a railway line, \nbut their benefits are significant and it is easy to integrate them when the government is \nimplementing  the  development  plan.  This  would  have  high  value  added  with  a  smaller \ninvestment, leveraging much more value addition. \n \n27.  The proposed investment program is consistent with two of the four pillars of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy of the PRC:30 (i) inclusive growth and balanced development, and \n(ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. The investment program encompasses \n(i) network development, which will enhance capacity and reduce bottlenecks; (ii) improved \nenergy  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  by  providing  a  more  efficient  and \nenvironment-friendly mode of transport in the region; (iii) enhanced safety through the provision \nof a reliable and safe mode of transport; (iv) support for the PRC railway development plan and \nthe western region development strategy; and (v) promotion of pro-poor economic growth in the \nregion, thereby reducing poverty.  \n \n28.  The investment program will be implemented in the southwestern PRC, a relatively poor \narea. The region is largely mountainous with abundant natural reserves of coal, and other \nnonferrous materials; and famous tourist sites. In spite of abundant natural resources, many \npeople are poor and the economic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty has failed to \ndevelop because of inadequate transport services and high costs. The railway density in the \nregion is the lowest in the PRC, and local governments and people living in the region see the \nrailway as a key investment for addressing this problem. Railway development is a part of the \n                                                 \n28 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated setting up many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng county of \nJiangxi province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew from \n8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from \n18,484 in 1992 to 52,153 in 1998\u2014an annual increase of 23%. In the same county, the number of people living \nbelow the poverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n29 Beneficial income and social impacts, particularly on women, were noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu\u2013\nMaoming Railway and Guang\u2013Mei-Shan Railway. \n30 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n ", "10 \ngovernment\u2019s program for the integrated development of transportation facilities in this poor \nregion and MOR plans to develop 6,500 km of railways in the region by 2015. The region also \nshares borders with Viet Nam, and Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are part of the Greater \nMekong Subregion. The development of railways is expected to play an important role in \nfacilitating and integrating this poor and underdeveloped region, and stimulating regional and \ninterprovincial trade and movement of people. The investment program is a priority investment \nincluded in the government\u2019s proposed 11th FYP and its economic stimulus package. The \nproposed  investment  program  is  in  line  with  the  Railway  Development  Plan  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s western region development strategy. \n \n29.  The investment program is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, \noperational, safety, and economic benefits. The investment program seeks to introduce modern \ntechnology  for  enhanced  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety  on  a \nnetwork basis; increase throughput; and improve reliability\u2014all of which will lead to a more \naffordable,  faster,  cheap,  safe,  energy-efficient,  and  more  environment-friendly  mode  of \ntransport in the PRC. ADB is influencing integration of advance technology in the railway system \nand this intervention in financing energy efficiency, environmental, and safety systems is also \nexpected to play a catalytic role in facilitating the flow of further foreign capital to finance the \nneeds of PRC railways.31 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n30.  The impact of the proposed investment program will be an improved transport system in \nthe  region  that  supports  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  and  the  western  region \ndevelopment strategy. Providing railway transportation in underserved, less developed, and \npoor areas will create conditions for developing local resources, employment opportunities, and \nhigher  incomes;  and  thus  raise  living  standards  in  the  project  area.  The  outcome  of  the \ninvestment program will be an energy-efficient, safe, reliable, affordable, and environment-\nfriendly  railway  transport  system  in  the  southwestern  region.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework on the investment program is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n31.  The  investment  program  comprises  (i)  introduction  of  energy-efficient  technologies, \nenvironment-friendly equipment, and safety equipment; (ii) a review of the existing institutional \narrangements  for  integrating  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  issues  in  railway \nmanagement; (iii) conducting safety and energy audits of a nominated railway administration; \nand (iv) providing capacity building support. At an institutional level, ADB will work with MOR to \nstudy international best practices for integrating energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, \nand safety management in its operations; and provide necessary capacity building support to \nachieve this. The key inputs needed for investment program implementation include equipment, \ninstallation, and MOR staff. \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  First targeted intervention in transport sector. The investment program will be the \nfirst targeted intervention to promote energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety \n                                                 \n31 ADB financing of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an dedicated passenger line in September 2005 attracted keen interest from \nother development partners such as the World Bank, AFD, and German development cooperation through KfW, \nwhich are now financing similar dedicated passenger lines. \n ", "11 \nin ADB\u2019s transport sector operations and in the PRC transport sector. The intervention will \ninfluence  the  government\u2019s  ongoing  investment  in  the  PRC  railways.  Discussions  with  the \ngovernment,  MOR,  and  design  institutes  in  the  PRC  indicated  a  strong  support  for  the \ninvestment program. They noted that a similar approach may be adopted for other investment \nprograms. The investment support may offer opportunities for gaining access to different energy \nefficiency  funds  such  as  the  Clean  Technology  Fund,  as  and  when  these  funds  are \noperationalized. \n \n33.  Use of multitranche financing facility. This is the first time the MFF modality will be \nused in the PRC transport sector. The investment program will be implemented in the less \ndeveloped southwestern region, an area that is supported by ADB, and form a part of the \ngovernment\u2019s railway development plan and its stimulus package. Options for possible financing \nmodalities were explored. The use of the MFF modality is considered the most appropriate for \nfinancing  this  investment  program,  given  the  need  to  finance  multiple  projects  under  an \ninvestment program, provide flexible tranche financing requirements to suit the readiness of \nindividual projects, have long-term engagement; and the strong institutional capacity of MOR. \nThe proposed MFF provides flexibility to the government and to ADB. Since the development \nplan  will  be  implemented  over  the  next  7  years,  the  government  can  submit  the  periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) when the projects are ready to use these equipment and materials; and \nthis can be matched with the availability of funds on the ADB side. The framework approach \nprovided an opportunity for streamlining domestic procedures. The investment program, to be \nimplemented  over  the  next  7  years,  reflects  a  medium-  to  long-term  engagement.  The \ninvestments  will  be  supported  by  sustained  medium-term  policy  dialogue  in  the  areas  of \nimproving energy efficiency, enhancing railway safety, enhancing environmental sustainability, \nand capacity development. These are supported by providing a TA grant. \n \n34.  Energy benefits. ADB involvement in the investment program will create awareness \nabout energy efficiency in a mode of transport that is considered to be among the most energy-\nefficient and environment-friendly. The rolling resistance of a steel wheel on a rail is much less \nthan that of rubber tires on a pavement; some theoretical estimates indicate that rail transport is \n6\u201310 times more energy-efficient than road transport. The United States Department of Energy \nhas estimated32 the energy intensity of rail freight at 345 British thermal units per ton-mile and \nroad freight at 3,476 British thermal units per ton-mile. This indicates that rail is about 10 times \nas  energy-efficient  as  truck  transport\u2014a  range  similar  to  the  estimate  made  by  Canadian \nresearchers.33 \n \n35.  Energy efficiency is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest way to invest in emerging clean \nenergy options. Under the investment program, ADB will finance procurement of more energy-\nefficient equipment and materials than what is currently in use. Energy-efficient technologies \nand products will save energy and money. They will consume less energy and waste less \nenergy, and will quickly repay their investments in reduced energy bill. The benefits from greater \nenergy efficiency and the consequent modal shift (on account of reduced fuel consumption) are \nquantified and included in the economic analysis. Based on the International Energy Agency \nreport34 and fuel data from China Statistical Yearbook 2006,35 the diverted traffic from road to \nrail, and due to improvements in energy efficiency as a result of equipment included in the \n                                                 \n32 US Department of Energy. 2004.Transport Energy Data Book, Edition 24.

PRC. \n ", "12 \nproposed investment program, will result in a benefit of CNY936 million in 2016, increasing to \nCNY3.2 billion in 2035. \n \n36.  Environmental benefits. There is a direct relationship between energy consumption \nand  emission  of  harmful  pollutants,  and  rail  transport  emits  far  fewer  harmful  elements \ncompared with road transport. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen oxides, \n2\nhydrocarbons,  sulfur  oxides,  and  suspended  particles.  Under  the  provisions  of  the  Kyoto \nProtocol, a value can be placed on CO emissions. Using specific fuel usage and emission rates \n2 \nfor the PRC, the diverted traffic from road to rail will result in a reduction of 22,106 tons of CO  \n2\nemissions in 2016, rising to 1.82 million tons in 2035 (cumulative saving of 12.9 million tons \nfrom 2016 to 2035)\u2014equivalent to an annual economic benefit of CNY1.51 million in 2016 \nincreasing to CNY882.37 million in 2035. The investment program will support environmental \nimprovements in the southwestern PRC. Use of energy-efficient technologies and products will \nlead to consequent reduction in emission of harmful pollutants. \n \n37.  Network  approach  to  safety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for \nenhancing  safety,  by  introducing  safe  and  reliable  technology,  modernizing  maintenance \nsystems, and capacity building. Since 2003, ADB has supported investments in railway safety, \nboth  at  the  sector  level  and  as  part  of  ADB-financed  projects.  This  proposed  investment \nprogram also seeks to adopt a network approach to safety by providing investment support for \nenhancing safety on the railway network in the southwestern PRC. This approach will help in \nproviding economies of scale and better management of emergencies, preventive maintenance, \nand accidents; and is consistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in the \nPRC. \n \n38.  New  technologies.  The  investment  program  will  introduce  new  and  modern \ntechnologies. The equipment to be procured will be the most modern available in the market, \nconsistent with the needs of current development in PRC railways. It will be energy-efficient, \nenvironment-friendly, and enhance safety. Examples of the kind of equipment proposed to be \nfinanced under the investment program are single-phase transformers instead of conventional \ntransformers, vacuum circuit breakers instead of oil circuit breakers, infrared hot box detection \nsystem instead of the manual system of checking hot axle-boxes, and a moving train fault \ndetection system instead of manual train examination. Intelligent electronic devices such as \nelectric trip devices, protective relays, energy meters, power monitors, power analyzers, and \nprogrammable logic controllers are proposed. Greater use of intelligence provided by software \nto hardware components will promote smart power systems and energy-efficient systems, which \nwill help reduce power consumption and consequent emissions. This equipment has significant \nenergy efficiency and safety benefits compared to what is used currently on PRC railways. \nIntegrating this equipment in PRC railways would help optimize performance, ensure reliability, \nand enhance safety. The technologies will be compatible and adaptable to existing systems, \nand will be proven and scalable. A key aspect of their adoption will be having an adequate trial \nand testing period, to ensure their successful operation. Adequate maintenance spares will be \nprovided to ensure their sustainability. A number of these technologies will be sourced from \nadvanced countries, which will influence integration of advance technology in the railway system \nand offer opportunities for the private sector. \n \n39.  Institutional and capacity development. Institutional development and enhancing staff \ncapacity are key objectives of the investment program. Working with MOR, the design institutes \nand the railway administrations, the existing institutional arrangements for integrating energy \nefficiency  and  environmental  issues  in  railway  management  will  be  reviewed,  and \nrecommendations made to make these more strategic and focused. The investment program \nproposes to undertake safety and energy audits of a nominated railway administration, make \n ", "13 \nrecommendations, and undertake capacity building programs to familiarize staff and create \nawareness about energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety. About 200 staff will \nbe  trained,  and  technical  exchanges  on  advanced  technologies  and  new  maintenance \ntechniques will be organized to familiarize and educate staff in these areas.  \n \nD.  Program Investment Plan \n \n40.  The investment program cost is estimated at $3.24 billion, including taxes and duties, \nprice contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation; and the first tranche \ncost at the equivalent of $967.34 million. Table 1 summarizes the total investment plan and the \ncost of the first tranche. The first tranche will be used for Yunnan and Guangxi provinces \n(Appendix  1).  The  kind  of  equipment  to  be  financed  includes  single-phase  transformers, \nintelligent power supply panels, infrared hot box detection system, lighting arrester, tunnel \nsafety devices, computer interlocking equipment, wireless telecommunications equipment, and \nnoise barriers. Details of the investment cost for the first tranche are in Appendix 9.

Financing Plan \n \n41.  The government has requested financing of up to an equivalent of $1 billion from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the investment program. Financing will be provided in \naccordance with ADB policy.36 The MFF will extend multiple loans37 to finance tranches under \nthe investment program, subject to the submission of a related PFR by the government and \nexecution of the related loan agreements. A framework financing agreement was signed with \nthe Government. All provisions of the loan regulations applicable to loans based on the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)38 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may \nbe included under the individual loan agreement. The government has the option to choose \nbetween eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for each loan. The specific terms for \neach loan will be based on the related PFR with an interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and the applicable commitment charge, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nPursuant to the framework financing agreement, the government submitted the first PFR to ADB \nfor tranche 1 in the amount of $300 million. It will have a term of 26 years, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years. Subsequent tranches could support similar individual loans.  \n \n42.  The borrower of each loan under the investment program will be the PRC. ADB will \nfinance 100% of the contract packages procured under the ADB loan. MOR will finance the \nremaining cost. MOR will make timely budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The \nallocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement will be presented with reference only to total \nexpenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach.39 A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2 and details \nare in Appendix 9.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total   % \nInvestment Program     \nAsian Development Bank   1,000.00  30.88 \nMinistry of Railways  2,238.50  69.12 \nTotal  3,238.50  100.00 \nFirst Tranche     \nAsian Development Bank   300.00  31.01 \nMinistry of Railways  667.34  68.99 \nTotal  967.34  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 2008.

A  steering \ncommittee headed by the director general of the Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, \nwill be responsible for the selection of the projects for subsequent financing by ADB, and their \nimplementation.  MOR  confirmed  that  the  staff  employed  will  be  experienced  in  technical, \nfinancial,  and  administrative  matters;  and  implementing  projects  financed  by  international \nfinancial institutions. An assessment of the financial management of MOR was undertaken and \nMOR has adequate capacity to manage the investment program. Details of the investment \nprogram implementation arrangements are in Appendix 10. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n44.  The investment program will be implemented over 7 years (2009\u20132016). The number of \nPFRs will be from three to six. The disbursement of the first PFR is expected to be completed \nby 30 June 2016. The disbursement of the last tranche will be completed no later than 30 June \n2017 (Appendix 11).  \n \n3.  Selection Criteria \n45.  Criteria  to  select  material  and  equipment  to  be  financed  in  the  tranches  for  ADB \nfinancing were agreed with MOR. The investment program will finance proven energy efficiency \ntechnologies, safety enhancement equipment and materials, and environmental equipment. \nThese  could  be  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  electric  power  supply,  (ii) electric  traction, \n(iii) specialized track equipment, (iv) environmental equipment, (v) operation and maintenance \nequipment, (vi) signaling and communication equipment, and (vii) safety equipment. \n \n46.  The list of equipment and materials to be financed in the first tranche has been selected \naccording to the criteria set out in Appendix 12. MOR will apply the same criteria in the selection \nof subsequent proposals. A steering committee headed by the director general of MOR, with \nparticipation from the design institutes, will select the projects for subsequent financing by ADB. \nDifferent tranches could support energy efficiency, environment-friendly equipment, and safety \nequipment to different degrees. ADB reserves the right to review proposals and refuse financing \nfor any tranche that does not meet the eligibility criteria or comply with ADB guidelines. \n \n4.  Procurement \n47.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nfinance  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix 13). Contracts valued equal or greater than $1 million will be procured through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $1 million  will  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding, in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, \n1999, subject to modifications agreed with ADB as determined by the particular circumstances \nof the contract package.40 Below $100,000, procurement will follow the shopping procedure. \n                                                 \n40 National competitive bidding will not be used for the first tranche. A national competitive bidding annex will be \nattached to the procurement plan proposed for subsequent tranches, if required.  \n ", "16 \nMOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to handle international bidding. The \nrelevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in \nall documents and contracts during bidding for, and implementation of, the investment program. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Measures \n48.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with  the  government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the investment program. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the investment program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the investment program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOR, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the investment program. \n \n49.  In relation to the investment program, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is \nestablished for prevention of undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources \nare made available for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the discipline \nunit  and  supervision  department  of  MOR  is  located  in  offices  involved  in  the  bidding, \nconstruction, and other operational activities under the investment program; and (iii) periodic \ninspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements are carried \nout. MOR shall also initiate liaison meetings with the prosecutor\u2019s office, on a needs basis, \nwhere warnings about, or information on, corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund \n50.  Disbursements under each PFR will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large \ncontracts, direct payment, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used. If the \ngovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be \nfollowed.  To  facilitate  disbursements,  MOR  will  set  up  an  imprest  account41 at  a  bank \nacceptable to ADB when the loan becomes effective. The initial amounts to be deposited in the \nimprest account shall not exceed the estimated expenditures, to be financed from imprest \naccounts for the next 6 months of implementation or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure may be used for liquidation and replenishment of imprest account and \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment. \nPayments in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or \nreplenished based on full supporting documentation. The financial assessment questionnaire \nindicates that the investment program will have an adequate financial management system in \nplace.  Funds  from  the  ADB  loan  will  flow  directly  to  MOR,  which  will  be  responsible  for \ndisbursements for the contract packages financed by ADB. \n \n7.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n51.  Because of the urgency of implementing the stimulus package, the government has \nrequested approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing of up to 20% of the first \ntranche loan proceeds, for expenditures incurred and paid for but not earlier than 12 months \nbefore the date of the loan agreement. This request was approved on 9 September 2009. The \n                                                 \n41 Imprest accounts are used in five ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n ", "17 \ngovernment has been informed that provision of advance contracting and procurement and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the tranches. For subsequent tranches, \nretroactive financing of otherwise eligible expenditures may be considered and allowed by ADB \nManagement when included in a PFR. Total retroactive financing will not exceed an amount \nequivalent to 20% of the individual loan and must have been incurred not more that 12 months \nbefore the signing of the related legal agreements. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  MOR  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  investment  program  and  have  such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. MOR will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  such  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements will \ninclude (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect to investment program expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment \nof compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for project management, and (iii) an \nopinion on the use of the imprest fund and statement of expenditures procedure. MOR will \nprepare and provide ADB with semiannual progress reports on program implementation. These \nreports  will  include  a  description  of  progress  made  during  the  review  period,  problems \nencountered and remedial actions taken, and subsequent activities to be undertaken. MOR will \nsubmit a project completion report to ADB within 3 months of completion of each tranche, and a \nfacility completion report within 6 months from completion of the investment program.  \n \n9.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  MOR agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating performance in relation to its impacts, \noutcomes, and outputs. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of implementation, will \ninclude (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) railway transport volumes, \n(iii) transport costs for passenger and freight services, (iv) energy efficiency indicators (energy \nconsumption per unit of revenue), (v) environmental indicators, and (vi) accident rates. At the \nbeginning of project implementation, MOR will establish baseline and target values for the \nindicators. The indicators will be measured at inception, completion, and 3 years later; and \ncompared with the baseline (Appendix 14). The main sources of data will include secondary \ndata from government sources. MOR will submit a report summarizing the key findings of \nmonitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later to ADB. \n \n10.  Investment Program Review \n54.  ADB and MOR will carry out review of the investment program and the PFRs annually \ncovering all institutional, administrative, technical, economic, and other relevant aspects that \nmay have an impact on the performance of the investment program. The review will examine \nimplementation progress and compliance with assurances in the loan agreement. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n55.  Institutional  development  and  enhancing  staff  capacity  are  key  objectives  of  the \ninvestment program. The government has requested TA support for institutional development \nand enhancing staff capacity of MOR and railway administration in areas of energy efficiency, \nenvironmental sustainability, and safety management. A TA grant of $600,000 from the TA \nSpecial Fund-Others is proposed to support this request. The proposed TA will (i) review the \nexisting institutional arrangements for integrating energy efficiency and environmental issues in \n ", "18 \nrailway management and operation, compare these in developed countries, identify the gaps, \nand make recommendations for MOR to implement; (ii) undertake safety and energy audits of a \nnominated railway administration, identifying areas where improvements can be made; and \n(iii) undertake capacity assessment and provide capacity building programs to familiarize and \ncreate  awareness  about  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety.  About \n200 staff  will  be  trained  and  technical  exchanges  on  advanced  technologies  and  new \nmaintenance techniques will be organized to familiarize and educate staff in these areas. The \noutline of the TA is in Appendix 15.  \n \n56.  Consultants under the TA grant will be recruited by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be \nselected through international competition using the quality and cost-based selection method. \nSimplified technical proposals will be required and will be evaluated based on a quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20. TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook;42 direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n57.  The program benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith the investment program. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and \nnet benefits will accrue to the project area. \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n58.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing with- and \nwithout-project situations, using constant 2009 economic prices. The investment program will \nintroduce new and modern technology for promoting energy efficiency, improving environmental \nsustainability, and enhancing safety. Economic costs include costs for materials and equipment, \nincluding installation and commissioning. Economic benefits include (i) user cost savings for \ndiverted freight and passenger traffic; (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic \nfrom buses, trucks, and waterways; (iii) time savings for base freight and passenger traffic \ncaused  by  operational  improvements;  (iv)  pollution  reduction  benefits;  (v)  energy  savings; \n(vi) avoided road infrastructure and maintenance costs; and (vii) avoided road accidents. The \nEIRR for the investment program is estimated at 26.81% (Appendix 16). Sensitivity analysis \ntested eight scenarios to assess the robustness of the results of the economic analysis. The \ninitial capital cost would have to be more than 304% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the experience of ADB-financed projects in the \nrailway sector, this switching value is unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to \ndecrease more than 92% to make the investment program economically nonviable. A 1-year \ndelay in completion does not affect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of \nbenefits and costs were also tested. The results showed that the investment program would \nmaintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n \nB.  Sustainability \n59.  The key factors for the sustainability for the equipment and materials are (i) availability of \nfunds for operation and maintenance, (ii) availability of spare parts and consumables, and \n(iii) required skills of the staff that will operate this equipment. The investment program is part of \nthe 11th FYP for railway development, approved by the State Council, with clear targets for \nimplementation and financing allocation. MOR has confirmed the availability of counterpart \n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "19 \nfunds for the investment program. The investment program will procure 2 years of spare parts \nand  consumables  for  the  first  2  years\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  with  the  equipment \nprocurement to sustain initial operations. The government and MOR have committed to the \navailability of funds for operation and maintenance of the equipment. Enhancing staff skills is \nincluded in the project design. These include overseas training, on-site training, and training in \nthe centers set up at the railway administration level. Initially, 200 staff will be trained in the \nhandling of this equipment.  \n \nC.  Safeguard Assessment \n60.  The first tranche of the investment program has been classified category C for all the \nsafeguard aspects (environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people). Because the \ninvestment program deals with the procurement of energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and \nsafety equipment, no potential safeguard impacts are envisaged. No potential environmental \nimpacts are expected, which is indicated in the safeguards framework (Appendix 17). The \ninstallation of this equipment and materials will have significant positive environmental impacts. \nAfter installation, environmental benefits will include reduction of oil use and emission. The \nequipment to be procured utilizes energy-efficient technologies, which will significantly reduce \nregional greenhouse gas emission and the oil consumption. It also provides the capacity to \nrespond  more  effectively  to  railway  accidents  and  natural  disasters,  thereby  limiting  any \npotential pollution resulting from these causes. \n \nD.  Social, Poverty, and Gender Aspects \n61.  The links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the \nsouthwestern PRC. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse environmental and weather \nconditions and limited farmland (e.g., mountains, cold weather, water scarcity, and soil erosion); \n(ii) geographical remoteness and isolation and high transport costs; and (iii) lack of access to \nmarkets, and good social and health care facilities. Providing an energy-efficient, environment-\nfriendly, safe, and secure transportation system enables the efficient flow of people and goods; \nconserves resources; protects the environment from pollution; and is an essential component \nfor a healthy population, a high quality of life, and a prosperous economy. The investment \nprogram, when implemented, will help increase standards of living and reduce poverty in the \nsouthwestern  PRC  by  removing  a  transport  constraint  to  sustainable  economic  growth. \nProviding efficient, affordable railway transportation in underserved, less developed areas will \ncreate the conditions necessary for developing local resources and generating employment and \nincome-enhancing opportunities. \n \n62.  The investment program will (i) reduce fuel consumption and enhance energy efficiency, \nenabling the PRC to save valuable foreign exchange, (ii) improve the environment and reduce \npollution; (iii) enhance railway safety, enabling railway users to benefit from lower transport \ncosts; (iv) increase the line capacity, benefiting consumers and producers of goods and services \nthrough the provision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; and \n(v) improve staff productivity, enabling railway users to benefit from lower costs.  \n \n63.  The  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  government,  which  will  benefit  from \nimproved safety, reduced economic losses, and a reduced energy bill; (ii) passengers, who will \nbenefit from affordable, cleaner, faster, and safer trips; (iii) freight shippers, who will benefit from \nreduced damages to shipments and more affordable, faster, and safer trips; and (iv) private \nsector  who  will  benefit  from  new  business  and  job  opportunities  and  enhanced  economic \ncompetitiveness. The poor will benefit equally or more from the intervention. Energy-efficient, \nenvironment-friendly, and safe railway transport will benefit all passengers. The links between \n ", "20 \npoverty and energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety are apparent; and the \npoor are at a disadvantage in recovering from the physical and economic losses suffered \nbecause of high energy costs, poor environment, and injuries or physical loss of goods. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 18. \n \n64.  Increased job opportunities created indirectly by railway development provide potential \nnew sources of income for women. Increase in female participation in the labor and tourism \nmarket increases women\u2019s net income and savings, improves overall family welfare, and helps \nimprove women\u2019s status. Women and other vulnerable groups benefit from railway development \nand have equal access to employment and wages. Railway development generates demand for \nlocal labor and increases worker productivity and wages. Expansion of secondary and tertiary \nindustries helps generate additional employment opportunities for both men and women, close \nto their homes.  \n \nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n65.  The  investment  program  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Sensitivity  tests \nindicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \ninvestment program to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which \nwould  delay  the  realization  of  benefits.  MOR  has  successfully  implemented  ADB-financed \nprojects. Risks associated with potential changes in government policy are minimal. In fact, the \ninvestment  program  is  an  integral  part  of  MOR\u2019s  five-year  plan,  which  mandates  a  20% \nimprovement in energy efficiency during 2006\u20132010, and a 10% reduction in sulphur dioxide \nemissions during 2006\u20132010. An analysis of the demand for railway transport shows that the \nsouthwestern  PRC  needs  additional  railway  transport  capacity  to  sustain  its  economic \ndevelopment. Macroeconomic conditions are expected to continue to be sound, with continuing \npolitical stability in the PRC. Strong economic performance is expected in the southwestern \nPRC based on the government\u2019s projections and its growth trends. \n \n66.  The equipment and materials to be procured and included in tranche 1 are based on \nproven  and  established  technologies.  MOR  has  experience  of  installing  new  technologies \nsuccessfully and these can be implemented within a relatively short time. For subsequent \ntranches, equipment and material with similar proven energy efficiency, environmental benefits, \nand safety benefits will be used. Thus, the technical risks of the investment program are minimal.  \n \n67.  Successful implementation requires sound project and financial management. MOR has \nstrong  implementation  experience  and  adequate  capacity.  The  innovative  design  of  the \ninvestment program will necessitate additional training, and supplemental TA support provided \nby ADB would further assist MOR in strengthening their capacities. MOR agreed to provide \ncounterpart support for TA implementation. The key MOR personnel are well experienced in \nADB project implementation.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES  \n \n68.  Specific assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the government has given \nthe following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Reform measures. The government will take necessary measures to continue \nimplementation of the Railway Development Plan (2004), and updated in 2008. \n(ii)  Equipment  quality.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that  the \nequipment is procured and used in accordance with the government\u2019s national \n ", "21 \ntechnical  standards,  and  that  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract \nmanagement are carried out in a periodic and satisfactory manner.  \n(iii)  Capacity  expansion.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that  all \ncapacity  expansion  activities  in  southwestern  PRC  are  completed  with  due \nconsideration of their environmental and social safeguards in a timely manner. \n(iv)  Sustainability.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  (a)  adequate \ncounterpart funding, staffing, and institutional support for implementation of the \nProject financed under the investment program; (b) that necessary measures are \ntaken promptly to resolve any issues identified during operation of the project \nequipment; and (c) appropriate budgetary allocations are made for the continued \noperation and maintenance of the project equipment. \n(v)  Anticorruption. In addition to ensuring compliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy,  the  government  will  ensure,  and  cause  MOR  to  ensure,  that  (a)  a \nsupervisory body is established for prevention of undue interference in business \npractices, and adequate resources are made available for its effective operation; \n(b) a leading group of officials from the supervision division of MOR is located in \noffices  involved  in  operational  activities  under  the  investment  program;  and \n(c) periodic inspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals \nand settlements are carried out. The government will also cause MOR to initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  a  needs  basis,  where  any \nwarnings  about,  or  information  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the investment program can be discussed. \n(vi)  Supply  of  rolling  stock.  The  government  will  ensure  that  MOR  provides \nsufficient rolling stock, at all times, for effective operation of the equipment. \n(vii)  Safety. The government will cause MOR to ensure the safety of the equipment in \naccordance with relevant government laws and regulations. \n(viii)  Audited accounts and financial statements. The government will cause MOR \nto submit to ADB audited accounts and financial statements within 6 months of \nthe end of each relevant fiscal year. \n(ix)  Monitoring and evaluation. The government will cause MOR to monitor and \nevaluate impact through a performance monitoring system, as agreed to by the \ngovernment  and  ADB,  to  ensure  that  project  equipment  and  materials  are \nmanaged efficiently, benefits are maximized, and impacts are monitored. The \ngovernment will also cause MOR to collect the necessary information and data \non project performance, as agreed to by the government and ADB, before project \nimplementation, and at completion of the investment program. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $1,000,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Railway Energy \nEfficiency and Safety Enhancement Investment Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n16 November 2009 \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nTable A1.1: Multitranche Financing Facility \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved transport  GDP is forecast to  Provincial and county/city  Government investment \nsystem in the region that  increase during 2015\u2013 statistics offices  programs are implemented as \nsupports sustainable  2020 at 5%\u20136% per    planned \nsocioeconomic  annum for the  Investment program   \ndevelopment and the  southwestern region  performance management  Complementary activities are \nwestern region    system at inception,  implemented \ndevelopment strategy   Per capita rural income  completion, and 3 years   \nin the southwestern  after\u2014with emphasis on  The government is committed \nregion increased from  socioeconomic  to reducing poverty in the \nCNY3,300 in 2007 to  improvement impacts  western region, based on the \nCNY4,400 in 2015 and    western region development \nCNY4,700 in 2020  MOR statistics and  strategy \n  operating data before and   \nEnergy consumption on  after the investment \nPRC railways per unit of  program \nrevenue is reduced by   \n20% from 2009 to 2015 \n \nTotal discharge of major \npollutants by PRC \nrailways is reduced by \n10% from 2010 to 2015 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAn energy-efficient, safe,  Transport capacity  Progress reports   Assumed economic growth \nreliable, affordable, and  expanded in the    rates materialize \nenvironment-friendly  southwestern PRC to  Project administration   \nrailway transport system  470 billion ton-km for  missions and project  Traffic forecasts are realized \nis developed in the  freight and 140 billion  completion report   \nregion  passenger-km for    Passengers and freight \n  passengers, in 2015   Post-evaluation surveys  operators realize the benefit \n    and reports from MOR  of using the railways \n  Cost of travel reduced     \n  from 35 fen/km in 2008  Statistics from local  Risk \n  to 15 fen/km in 2015  environmental protection  Capacity enhancement \n    bureaus, communication  works are not completed \n  Fuel savings increased  bureaus, and MOR  timely \n  from CNY936 million in   \n \n2016 to CNY3.2 billion   \n \nin 2035 \n \nCO  emissions are \n2\nreduced by 22,106 tons \nin 2016 and 1.82 million \ntons in 2035 \n \nSO  emissions are \n2\nreduced by 10% from \n2009 to 2015 \n \n ", "    Appendix 1  23 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms \n  Recommendations of     \nenergy and safety \naudits are adopted by \n2013 \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

Railway Sector Profile \n \n1.  Key features. Despite government efforts to increase the country\u2019s transport capacity, \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the \nend of 2008, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) railway system of 79,700 kilometers (km) \ncomprised 64,000 km of national railways and 15,700 km of joint venture and local railways. \nFrom  1978,  when  economic  reforms  were  first  introduced,  through  to  2008,  the  PRC \nexperienced sustained rapid economic growth. This resulted in a correspondingly rapid increase \nin demand for transportation. Passenger transport grew by 9% yearly and freight transport by \n7.6% yearly during the period. Railways are the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, \naccounting for 45.2% of total freight ton-km in 2008, followed by 29.6% for inland waterways \nand seashore shipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. Road \ntraffic accounted for 53.3% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with 33.4%, civil aviation \nwith 12.9%, and coastal and inland waterways with 3.5%.  \n \n2.  Recent  developments.  To  minimize  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  of  the  PRC \nincreased its investment in transport infrastructure in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2001\u20132005, and \nthe Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11th FYP), 2006\u20132010. Investment in transport infrastructure as a \nshare of gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled in the last decade. The PRC had \ninvested CNY308 billion in capital construction to build 6,458 km of new lines, provide 3,275 km \nof double lines, and electrify 6,259 km of tracks in the Tenth Five-Year Plan. A World Bank \nstudy1 indicates that total transport investment should increase to at least 3.8% of GDP to avoid \nthe economic costs associated with transport constraints. The government continues to accord \nhigh priority to transport infrastructure investments to meet the increase in transport demand. \n \n3.  Future development priorities and outlook. Substantial investments in the road and \nrailway sectors from both domestic and international financing sources, including the private \nsector, are envisaged in the 11th FYP. The plan continues to emphasize railway development, \nand seeks to accelerate railway construction. It envisages (i) the construction of 17,000 km of \nnew lines, and (ii) the double tracking and electrification of 45% of the network length. The plan \nseeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway  network  by  constructing  7,000 km  of \npassenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport  corridors  by  increasing  the \ncapacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the poor western region (to \n34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at the southwest and northwest borders; and (v) \ndevelop a nationwide intermodal container network. A total investment of CNY1.5 trillion, or \nabout $200 billion (CNY1.25 trillion for construction and CNY250 billion for rolling stock) is \nplanned in the 11th FYP, of which a total of CNY765.2 billion has been spent in 2006, 2007, and \n2008. \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020), \nwhich was updated in 2008. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in \n2004 to 120,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to \ndeveloping railways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less \ndeveloped. The route network length will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the \nwestern region of the PRC by 2020. The plan also calls for separating passenger and freight \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998. China: Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the Transport Sector. Washington, DC (Report \nNo. 1595-CHA Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office).  \n2  By April 2007, train speed had been increased to over 160 kilometers per hour (km/h) on 14,000 km, and          \n200\u2013250 km/h on 6,000 km of railway lines. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \ntraffic in heavily trafficked corridors and for developing 12,000 km of passenger-dedicated \ncorridors by 2020. \n \n5.  Other development partner operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to \nexpand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed \nthe development of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, \nthe World Bank has provided 13 loans totaling $3.2 billion for 12 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. ADB introduced the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) in 2004 to \nPRC railways and it has provided two loans for about $140 million (\u20ac113 million) for network \nexpansion.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  has  provided  six  loans  for \n\u20ac604 million and $80 million since 2005. Austria provided a loan of \u20ac30 million in 2006 and Spain \nprovided a loan for \u20ac80 million in 2005. Export-Import Bank of the United States has provided two \nloans of $300 million for procurement of track equipment since 2003.  \n \nB.  ADB Experience \n \n6.  Assistance  to  the  sector.  ADB  is  the  lead  lender  and  has  focused  on  improving \ninfrastructure in less developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 17 loans totaling about $3.5 billion to help \nfinance the construction of 1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, \n6,620 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  eight  national  railway  projects,  and  a  sector-wide \nintervention to enhance safety on the PRC railway network. These projects have introduced \nmodern technology and improved the efficiency of railway operation through institutional and \nstructural reforms. ADB has also provided 14 technical assistance (TA) initiatives totaling about \n$6.6 million to promote the commercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, \nachieve cost recovery, and improve railway management.  \n \n7.  Evaluation of assistance. The evaluation3 of ADB assistance to the transport sector in \nthe PRC concluded that ADB\u2019s program for railways was a success. The evaluation noted that \nADB strategic priorities were well aligned with the PRC\u2019s needs in the rail transport subsector. \nIts overall focus on building railways using modern technologies addressed needs to increase \nrailway capacity and reduce the persistent gap between supply and demand as quickly and \nefficiently  as  possible.  The  priority  given  by  ADB  to  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation,  and  its  emphasis  on  restructuring  and  reforming  policy,  was  well  matched  to \nevolving institutional reforms in railways. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe executing agencies for project implementation. The speed of implementation has often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies have generally complied \nwith the loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been carried out \nsatisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  audited \nfinancial statements have been found to be generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 17 railway projects, \n10 are complete and 7 are under implementation. The projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency established for project processing and implementation has adequate \ncapacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints on traffic throughout the \nnetwork, and the impact on project viability of existing and planned railway lines and other \ntransportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway \nprojects with appropriately determined debt\u2013equity ratios. The railway projects have contributed \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Living standards have gone up and poverty has been reduced. The \nproject  performance  audit  report4 for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in  the  PRC \nconcluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n \n8.  Strategy  and  priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce poverty, and (iii) protect the environment and manage natural resources. In pursuit of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  the  development  of  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport  networks  to meet  the  needs  of  a growing  market  economy  and  to  contribute  to \nreducing poverty through investment targeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional \nreforms. Because of the importance of railway transport for the development of the national \neconomy, ADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector is focused on (i) expanding the railway system \nby constructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing \nand increasing safety and capacity to improve transport efficiency of the national railway system, \n(iii) promoting  energy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability,  (iv)  commercializing \nrailway operations to sustain efficient operations, and (v) increasing railway competitiveness in \nthe transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9.  Poverty reduction. To heighten the poverty reduction impact of transport investments, \nADB  pays  particular  attention  to  four  issues:  (i) locating  ADB-financed  projects  in  less \ndeveloped  and  poor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development, \n(ii) encouraging the maximization of employment of poor people during project construction and \noperation, (iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from \npoor villages, and (iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen the reach of \nproject benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10.  Governance and policy reform agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  the  restructuring  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  the \ncommercialization of operations, the increased management autonomy of railway operations, \nhuman resource  development, and improvements in financial management and accounting \nsystems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  promoting  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  enhancing \nsafety in construction, operation, and maintenance.5 ADB supports the safety and security \nobjective on PRC railways through the introduction of modern technologies, policy development, \nlegislation, monitoring, and outreach activities. \n \n11.  Private  sector  development.  The  PRC\u2019s  large  infrastructure  needs  require  local \ngovernments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include the construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12.  Regional cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives: (i) the Greater Mekong Subregion, through Yunnan and Guangxi province; (ii) the \nCentral Asian Regional Economic Cooperation initiative, through Xinjiang Autonomous Region; \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

The improvement of cross-border trade regimes \nis a common feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the \nPRC, expanding regional markets and options could help reduce poverty. The Greater Mekong \nSubregion  and  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  programs  are  developing \nstrategies for cooperation in transport, of which rail transport is an important subsector. Steps \nare being taken to develop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional \ntransport projects, e.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC railway development and the Pan-\nAsian railway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring targets, indicators, modality, and processes. The Government monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  ADB  reviews  this  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry partnership strategy. Indicators for evaluating sector performance include (i) economic \ndevelopment and poverty indicators for the western region; (ii) transport density in relation to \nland area and population; (iii) public and private investment in railways; (iv) transport demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges, etc.); and (vi) cross-border traffic volumes with the Central Asian republics, the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n \nIndicators \nItem \n2000  2008  2010  2015\nA.

In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World \nBank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have been mainly involved in expanding \nthe  capacity  of  national  railways.  In  the  past  20  years,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transport capacity, \nparticularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed the development of new sections \nof the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided 13 \nloans totaling $3.2 billion for 12 national railway projects and one local railway project. ADB \nintroduced  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  in  2004  to  the  PRC  railway  and \ncofinanced a railway project in Yunnan.

Managing safety is an important aspect of reliable transportation and critical to providing \na competitive, high quality, and safe mode of transport to people and goods. The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), a country with diverse geology and a challenging environment, has \ntwo-thirds of its area threatened by floods, nearly half of the cities located in the seismic belt, \nmore mountainous areas than plain areas, great elevation differences between east and west, \nfrequent geological disasters such as landslides and flow of debris, frequent typhoons in the \nsouthern part, frequent sandstorms and windstorms in the western part, and snowstorms in the \nnorthern part. PRC railways crisscross the length and breadth of the country, and this working \nenvironment makes managing safety on the PRC railways a technical and human challenge.  \n \n2.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  and  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  attach  great \nimportance to rail transport safety, and it is an important cornerstone of the PRC railway \ndevelopment strategy. Safety is an inherent element underlying all planned modernization and \ntechnological upgrading on PRC railways. It is supported through various development plans, \nsuch as the five-year plans, annual development plans, and the long-term railway network \ndevelopment plan 2020, which include strategy and investments in the important area of railway \nsafety.  \n \n3.  The  railway  development  plan,  which  lays  down  an  ambitious  blueprint  of  railway \nnetwork  development  until  2020,  envisages  that  safety  of  rail  transport  services  shall  be \nensured by (i) strictly adhering to safety regulations, (ii) improving staff education and technical \nskills  through  training,  (iii)  upgrading  technology  and  modernizing  equipment  for  railway \noperation and safety, and (iv) strengthening responsibility and accountability for safety in railway \ntransport. \n \n4.  The plan also envisages that information technology and computerization will cover all \nfacets of railway operation and management\u2014particularly transport safety and operations. It \nalso recognizes that expansion of the railway network and technological upgrading have not \nbeen accompanied by investments and development in human resources, and seeks to provide \nimpetus by increased investment support. MOR has adopted a proactive strategy for safety \nmanagement and adopted initiatives that cover technology, equipment, and human resource \ndevelopment through training and education under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.  \n \n5.  PRC  railways  have  a  well-established  three-level  organizational  structure  (ministry, \nrailway administration, and station) for the management of safety on the railways (Figure A6.1).  \n \n6.  Within MOR, the supervision of safety is the responsibility of the Safety Supervision \nBureau (SSB), which has three divisions. SSB is headed by a director general, and has the \nfollowing responsibilities: \n \n(i)  supervise the execution by railway administrations and related departments of \nthe directions, policies, laws, regulations, and instructions on safety of production \nissued by the state; \n(ii)  supervise  the  implementation  of  regulations,  acts,  and  measures  relating  to \noperational safety, non-railway personnel safety, and accident treatment; \n(iii)  supervise maintenance and repair, and periodical repair of all train operation \nequipment; \n ", "  Appendix 6  35 \n(iv)  monitor  and  check  the  training,  education,  and  examination  of  staff  directly \ninvolved in train operation; urge the relevant department and unit to take effective \nmeasures to improve the quality of operation staff; \n(v)  assist in the preparation and modification of Railway Technical Management \nRegulations and other codes, regulations, instructions, and the train working \ndiagram; \n(vi)  prepare  regulations  for  treatment  of  railway  operation  accident  and  train \noperational safety supervision work; and \n(vii)  organize the relevant railway entities to carry out investigation and treatment of \nvery large train operation accident and large accidents of a serious nature; and to \nreview  and  propose  follow-up  measures  in  the  case  of  very  large  or  large \naccidents that are controversial or those that are not properly treated. \n \n7.  The three divisions of SSB have the following functions: \n \n(i)  General Division: (a) general administration of SSB; (b) carry out analysis of \naccidents on all railways, including the national railway, joint venture railway, and \nlocal railways; and (c) any other matter not covered by the other two divisions. \n(ii)  Operation Safety Division: (a) carry out investigation, determine cause(s) and \nresponsibility for operational accidents; (b) arrange and oversee training of staff \nin areas of operation safety; and (c) oversee preventive actions to be taken by \nrailway  administrations  based  on  the  recommendations  made  in  accident \ninvestigations.  \n(iii)  Labor Safety Division: (a) supervise the operational departments and entities of \nPRC  railways  with  regard  to  their  implementation  of  national  policies,  laws, \nregulations, and instructions on safety; (b) supervise the performance of staff \nresponsible for operational safety; (c) supervise labor and operational discipline \nrelevant for operational safety; (d) organize investigations and determine cause(s) \nin  the  case  of  extra  large  accidents  and  any  other  fatal  accident  that  is \nconsidered important, as a special case; and (e) carry out analysis of accidents \ninvolving staff. \n \n8.  The staff of SSB has expertise in railway operation and safety, including the disciplines of \ntransportation, locomotive, rolling stock, permanent way, and signaling and communications. \nStaff from any of the three divisions may be specially appointed inspector of safety supervision \nfor participation in investigations of accidents in accordance with the regulations for safety and \naccident treatment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \n \nFigure A6.1: Safety Organization for Ministry of Railways \n \n \n \n  Ministry of  Director General \n  Railways \n  Safety \n  Supervision \nDeputy Director-\n  Bureau \nGeneral \n \n \n \n \n \nGeneral Division:  Operation Safety  Labor Safety \n \nChief (1),  Division: Chief (1),  Division: Chief (1),  \n \nMembers (2)  Deputy Chief (2),  Members (2) \n \nMembers (4) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemaining 17 railway \nRailway Administration \n \nadministrations  \n \nhave similar setup \n \n  Railway Administration Safety \n  Supervision Office \n \n \n \nSafety Supervision Branch \n \nOffice (one or three offices \n \nunder each railway \n \nadministration) \n \n \n  Safety section at every station \n  and depot  \n \n \n \n  Source: Ministry of Railways. \n \n9.  The second level of safety management is at the railway administration level. Within the \nrailway administration, a safety supervision office is responsible for monitoring safety in the \njurisdiction of the railway administration. The safety supervision office has a dual reporting \nfunction\u2014it reports to the director general of the railway administration and submits direct \nreports to SSB. Following the dissolution of 41 sub-railway administrations in April 2005 as part \nof  the  organizational  reform,  the  safety  supervision  offices  in  the  former  sub-railway \nadministration have been reorganized into safety supervision branch offices to monitor the \nsafety functions. Strengthening of the safety supervision branch offices was done by assigning \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nadditional staff from those rendered surplus in the former sub-railway administrations. The \nsafety supervision branch offices monitor and supervise the safety functions of railway operation \nstaff in the field units (i.e., stations and depots).  \n \n10.  The third level of safety management is the field level, where every station and depot \nhas a safety section for monitoring and supervising railway operation safety functions in the field \nunit.  \n \n11.  Every year, MOR organizes a National Safety Work Meeting that reviews the work done \nin the field of safety in the past year and prepares a program of work to be done in the future for \nenhancing safety. MOR also conducts urgent inspections of railways and related facilities to \nensure safe transportation;1 and regularly issues directions to the railway administrations and \nstations for safety drills, inspections, and undertaking special preventive measures to avoid \naccidents.  \n \n12.  The structure for implementing and monitoring the safety of railway operations has \nworked  well.  Continual  improvement  in  railway  operational  safety  is  evidenced  by  the \ncontinuous declining trend in all accident statistics (Table A6). This is indicative of the efficacy of \nthe  safety  organization.  Following  the  dissolution  of  the  sub-railway  administrations,  the \nstrengthening of the safety function in the newly constituted safety supervision branch offices \nwas a step in the right direction.  \n \nTable A6: Accident Statistics of Railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nNumber of Accidents  Accident Losses \nExtra Large, \nAssets  Grievous \nYear  Total  Very Large,  Loss of life \n(CNY million)  Injuries \nand Large \n1990  4,126  64  40.00  166  317 \n1995  3,010  19  31.58  91  176 \n2000  827  19  44.15  65  106 \n2005  1,142  11  34.07  39  59 \nSource: Ministry of Railways. \n \n13.  With respect to the handling of accidents, a detailed procedure has been laid down for \nreporting  railway  accidents  and  incidents  to  various  levels  of  management  within  the \ngovernment and MOR. The procedure2 stipulates that the occurrence of an extra large accident \nis to be reported to the State Council within 24 hours of its occurrence. Within MOR, the \nGeneral Division of SSB is responsible for collating statistics and preparing analysis of all \naccidents on the national, joint venture, and local railways in the PRC. The regulations3 lay \ndown in detail the procedure and responsibilities for reporting accidents, and require swift \nmeasures to be taken for rescue and relief after the occurrence of an accident to minimize \nlosses.  \n \n                                                 \n1  In the summer of 2000, there was a nationwide push for transportation safety after several serious accidents \nresulted in loss of life. MOR issued directions to the railway administrations and stations to check rail conditions \nwithin their areas carefully, including fire-and-flood control measures along railways; and strict regulation of \nconstruction sites and on-the-job safety. MOR issued instructions to stop any overloading of freight and passenger \ntrains and to punish those responsible severely. \n2  State Council regulation no. 34, issued in 2000 for extra large accidents and MOR Regulation No. 3 (2000) for all \nother accidents. \n3  MOR Regulation No. 3, 1 July 2000. \n ", "38  Appendix 6 \n14.

Introduction \n \n1.  Enhancing energy efficiency and promoting environmental sustainability are critically \nimportant for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) transportation sector. The PRC has the \nsecond highest energy consumption in the world, next only to the United States, and the \nconsumption is growing at a high rate. In 2007, the PRC consumed 2.65 billion equivalent coal \ntons,  an  increase  of  almost  100%  compared  to  1.39  billion  tons  equivalent  coal  in  2000 \n(Table A7). Energy consumption in the PRC is expected to grow at 8% annually up to 2020.  \n \n2.  The PRC has limited energy resources and is therefore dependent on imports to meet \nthe domestic demand, particularly petroleum products. It is one of the largest importers of \npetroleum and volumes of imports have been growing at a steady pace. In 2007, the PRC \nimported 163 million tons of petroleum compared to 70 million in 2000, an annual increase of \n12.8% (Table A7). \nTable A7: Energy Consumption in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n \nEnergy Consumption in  Amount of  Imports to Total \nYear  Equivalent Coal   Petroleum Imported  Consumption \n(billion tons)  (million tons)  (%) \n2000  1.39  70.27  33.8 \n2001  1.43  60.26  31.0 \n2002  1.52  69.41  32.8 \n2003  1.75  91.02  39.3 \n2004  2.03  122.70  47.5 \n2005  2.25  126.80  43.9 \n2006  2.46  145.20  48.2 \n2007  2.65  163.16  50.5 \n  Source: China Statistical Year Book (various years). Beijing. \n \n3.  The Government of the PRC and the Ministry of Railways (MOR) attach high importance \nto energy conservation and environmental sustainability in the PRC railway sector, and have \nincluded energy efficiency and environmental sustainability as key priorities in the Eleventh \nFive-Year Plan (11th FYP). MOR highlights energy efficiency and environmental sustainability as \nessential elements underlying all planed modernization and technological upgrading on PRC \nrailways. This is supported through various development plans, such as the long-term railway \nnetwork  development  plan  (2020),  five-year  plans,  annual  development  plans,  and  energy \nsaving and environmental protection annual plans. \n \n4.  The long-term railway network development plan lays down an ambitious blueprint of \nrailway network development until 2020. It envisages that energy efficiency and environmental \nsustainability in the railway sector shall be achieved by (i) strictly complying with energy saving \nand environmental protection regulations, and accomplishing the indicators of energy saving \nand environmental protection; (ii) upgrading technology and modernizing equipment for railway \noperation, and promoting application of advanced energy-efficient and environmental equipment; \n(iii) enhancing management of energy efficiency and reducing emissions; (iv) improving staff \nprofessional knowledge and technical skills, and fostering staff awareness of energy saving and \nenvironmental sustainability; and (v) encouraging and spreading the adoption of new energy \nand renewable energy. \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \nB.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n5.  PRC  railways  have  a  well-established  three-level  organizational  structure  (ministry, \nrailway administration, and station) for management of energy conservation and environmental \nsustainability on the railways (Figure A7). \n \n  Figure A7: Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Organization \n  for the Ministry of Railways \n \n \n \n \n  Director General \n \n \n \nDeputy Director \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \n   \nEnergy Conservation and Environmental Protection Division \n \n \n \n \nEnergy Conservation and Environmental Offices \n \nin 18 Railway Administrations \n \n \n \n \n \nEnergy Conservation \nEnvironmental \n \nand Environmental \nProtection Monitoring \n \nProtection Units \nStation\n \n \n \n  Energy Conservation \nEnvironmental \n  and Environmental \nProtection Monitoring \n  Protection Units \nStation\nXXXX Environmental Protection Monitoring Station \n \n \nEnvironmental  Energy Conservation \n \nProtection Monitoring  and Environmental \n \nStation Protection Units \n \n \n \n  Environmental  Energy Conservation \n  Protection Monitoring  and Environmental \n  Station Protection Units \n \nSource: Ministry of Railways. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 7 \n6.  At MOR level, the supervision of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability is the \nresponsibility of the Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Division (ESCPD) in the \nDevelopment and Planning Department. ESCPD is headed by a director, supervised by a \ndeputy director general and a director general, and has the following main responsibilities: \n \n(i)  prepare the regulations of energy conservation, environmental sustainability, and \nresource utilization in the railway sector; \n(ii)  prepare railway conservation and environmental mid-long term development plan, \nenergy conservation annual plan for railway entities, annual plan for controlling \nemission and pollution; and issue the status and indicators bulletin of energy \nconservation and emission reduction; \n(iii)  organize  review  of  environmental  impact  assessment  reports  of  large  and \nmedium size railway construction projects; appraise design documents of the \nlarge and medium construction projects and conduct acceptability examination \nfor completed projects; \n(iv)  supervise the execution by railway administrations and related departments of \nthe directions, policies, laws, regulations, and instructions on energy efficiency \nand environmental sustainability issued by the state; \n(v)  supervise  the  implementation  of  regulations,  acts,  and  measures  relating  to \noperational energy efficiency and environmental sustainability; \n(vi)  direct and supervise the treatment of railway environmental pollution accidents; \nand \n(vii)  advertise  national  and  MOR  policies  of  energy  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability; educate the energy and environmental staff of MOR. \n \n7.  The staff of ESCPD has expertise in railway operation, energy efficiency, environmental \nengineering, and transportation.  \n \n8.  The second level of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability management is at \nthe railway administration level. At railway administration level, an Energy Conservation and \nEnvironmental Protection Office (ESCPO) is set up to coordinate and undertake actions for \nenergy efficiency and environmental sustainability. The ESCPO has dual reporting functions; it \nreports to the director general of the railway administration and submits direct reports to ESCPD. \nESCPOs monitor and supervise the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability functions \nat the railway administration level. \n \n9.  ESCPOs at the railway administration level have the following main responsibilities: \n \n(i)  carry out the state and ministry regulations and laws related to energy saving and \nenvironmental  sustainability  and  local  government\u2019s  energy  saving  and \nenvironmental  rules,  prepare  railway  administration\u2019s  operational  and \nmanagement  rules  of  energy  saving  and  the  environment  based  on  the \nregulations and policies above; \n(ii)  prepare railway administration\u2019s annual plan of energy saving and environmental \nprotection indicators, update annual plan, and organize their implementation; \n(iii)  organize  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and  prepare  soil  erosion \nprevention plan of construction projects; \n(iv)  monitor and supervise the implementation of environmental mitigating measures \nof railway construction projects in their jurisdiction; \n(v)  mitigate environmental pollution; \n ", "  Appendix 7  43 \n(vi)  monitor, collect, and analyze the indicators of the railway administration\u2019s energy \nsaving and environmental protection; \n(vii)  prepare  the  emergency  plan  on  environmental  accidents  and  respond  to \naccidents; and \n(viii)  coordinate and resolve environmental dissensions, and receive complaints from \naffected people and entities. \n \n10.  The third level of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability management is at \nthe field level and includes two kinds of units: (i) an independent environmental protection \nmonitoring station, and (ii) an energy conservation and environmental protection unit. \n \n11.  Each  railway  administration  has  three  to  five  environmental  protection  monitoring \nstations,1 depending on the size and scale of the area. It has about eight to 12 environmental \nprofessional  and  technical  staff,  and  is  equipped  with  special  environmental  monitoring \nequipment and inspecting instruments. \n \n12.  The environmental protection monitoring station has the following functions: \n \n(i)  inspect  periodically  the  indicators  of  noise,  water,  gas,  and  radiation  of \nelectromagnetism from the environmental sensitive spots, and provide quarterly \nmonitoring reports to railway administrations; \n(ii)  monitor and supervise the operation of environmental equipment; \n(iii)  participate in the investigation of accidents in accordance with the regulations for \nthe treatment of environmental accidents and provide quantitative analyses on \nthe accidents; \n(iv)  provide technical training and professional education regularly for staff in the \nrailway administration; and \n(v)  assist MOR and the railway administration to conduct a periodic environmental \nexamination. \n \n13.  Energy conservation and environmental protection units are located in every station and \ndepot,2 and each unit has one to five experienced staff. Their functions are as follows: \n \n(i)  carry out the MOR and railway administration regulations on energy saving and \nenvironmental sustainability; \n(ii)  report  indicators  of  energy  saving  and  environmental  protection,  and  update \nannual plan of stations and depots; \n(iii)  operate, manage, and maintain the energy saving and environmental equipment \nin the stations and depots; \n(iv)  implement  the  annual  plan  of  station  energy  saving  and  environmental \nsustainability,  enhance  energy  saving  and  ensure  the  implementation  of \nenvironmental mitigating measures; \n(v)  conduct  data  collection  of  statistical  information  on  energy  saving  and \nenvironmental protection, and analyze status of energy saving and environmental \nsustainability; \n                                                 \n1  For example, Chengdu Railway Administration has four environmental monitoring stations, located in Chengdu, \nChongqing, Guiyang, and Yinchuan. \n2  For example, Chengdu Railway Administration has 50 stations and the energy saving and environmental protection \noffice of Chengdu Railway Administration supervises 50 energy saving and environmental units. \n ", "44  Appendix 7 \n(vi)  promote  advanced  energy-efficient  and  environment-friendly  technology  and \nequipment; and  \n(vii)  provide  training  to  the  staff  in  the  stations  and  depots  and  promote  staff \nawareness of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. \n \n14.  The above organization structure for management and monitoring energy efficiency and \nenvironmental sustainability has worked well. Every year, MOR organizes an annual meeting to \ndiscuss achievements in railway energy efficiency and environmental protection. The meeting \nreviews the progress made and discusses the targets and plan for the next year. A mid-year \nmeeting is also held to take stock of the progress achieved in the first 6 months and necessary \nadjustments are made to achieve the annual targets. Annual training sessions are organized for \nthe staff working in energy conservation and environmental offices as well as related institutes \nevery year. Each railway administration also organizes one or two training sessions for the staff \nfrom the stations and depots. \n \nC.  Targets and Actions \n \n15.  MOR  has  set  measurable  targets  for  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nsustainability for the 11th FYP, 2006\u20132010. In comparison to 2005, by 2010 the plan seeks the \nfollowing reductions: (i) energy consumption per unit revenue reduced by 20%; (ii) fresh water \nusage  per  unit  revenue  reduced  by  10%;  (iii)  chemical  oxygen  demand  per  unit  revenue \nreduced by 10%; and (iv) sulfur dioxide emission reduced by 10%.  \n \n16.  MOR  attaches  high  importance  to  achieving  these  targets.  It  has  taken  steps  for \ncontrolling energy consumption, reducing pollution emission, and creating awareness; and has \ninstituted systems for monitoring and management of entities at the three levels. Introducing \nnew products, new technologies and expertise, new methods of investment, and clean energy \nsuch as geothermal energy are areas where some progress has been made. MOR plans to \nundertake innovation in maintenance and sulfur dioxide treatment to achieve targets of the 11th \nFYP.  In  addition,  MOR  plans  to  strengthen  transportation  and  organization  management, \noptimize asset and rolling stock utilization, improve equipment quality, enhance driving skills \nand techniques, and achieve higher operational efficiencies. MOR also seeks to enhance the \noutreach activities and create awareness about energy conservation measures to the traveling \npublic and MOR employees. \n \n ", "Appendix 8  45\nLESSONS FROM ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK-FINANCED \nRAILWAY PROJECTS \n \nLoan/TA  Objectives  Major Accomplishments and Lessons Learned \nShanxi\u2013Xiaoliu  (i) Promote efficient and  The project was deemed unsuccessful because of a \nRailway (Loan 948)  economic transport of  shortfall in traffic and resulting low economic internal rate \n  minerals and agricultural  of return, poor institutional setup, and operational \nEA: Shanxi\u2013Xiaoliu  outputs  constraints on the adjacent locally funded section.a The \nRailway Company  (ii) Facilitate industrial  post-evaluation highlighted the need to (i) have a fully \n  development in the poor  functional and committed EA responsible for both \nproject area   construction and operation at the project planning stage, \n(iii) Provide efficient  (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts, and (iii) ensure an \npassenger services linking  adequate institutional setup.

Investment Program Management \n \n1.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR) will be the executing agency responsible for the overall \ninvestment program implementation. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, under \nMOR,  will  coordinate  the  investment  program  management  task  and  be  responsible  for \nprocurement, withdrawals, and reporting in relation to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nMOR confirmed that the staff employed will be experienced in railway engineering, financial, \nand  administrative  matters;  and  implementing  projects  financed  by  international  financial \ninstitutions. \n \nB.  Implementation Period \n \n2.  The  investment  program  will  be  implemented  in  about  7  years  (2009\u20132016). \nProcurement for the first tranche loan will start in January 2010 and the disbursement will start \naccordingly after loan effectiveness. Periodic financing requests for subsequent tranches are \nexpected in late 2010 and in early 2011. The installation of equipment for the last tranche will be \ncompleted by January 2016. Final acceptance will be completed by December 2016 (Appendix \n11). Disbursement of the last tranche will be completed no later than 30 June 2017. \n \nC.  Procurement \n \n3.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance procurement of energy efficiency, environmental, \nand  safety  enhancement  equipment  and  systems  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix 13). Contracts valued equal to or greater than $1 million will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding. Contracts valued at less than $1 million will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding or national competitive bidding, in accordance with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications \nagreed with ADB as determined by the contract package. Below $100,000, procurement will \nfollow the shopping procedure. MOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to \nhandle international bidding. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1997, as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during  bidding  for  and \nimplementation of the investment program. \n \nD.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the investment program. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nbidding documents for the investment program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the investment program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the investment program. \n \n5.  In relation to the investment program, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is \nestablished for prevention of undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources \nare made available for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \ndivision of MOR is located in offices involved in bidding, installation, and other operational \nactivities  under  the  investment  program;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements are carried out. MOR shall also initiate \nliaison meetings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, as needed, to discuss any warnings about, or \ninformation  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \ninvestment program. \n \nE.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n6.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large \ncontracts, direct payment, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used. The \ngovernment will be reimbursed, according to ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure, for any eligible \nexpenditure it initially funds. To facilitate disbursements, MOR will set up an imprest account1 at \na bank acceptable to ADB after the loan becomes effective. The ceiling of the imprest account \nwill be either the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure may be used in liquidating and replenishing the imprest account and \nreimbursing eligible expenditures of not more than $200,000 per payment. Payments over the \nstatement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished on the basis of \nfull  supporting  documentation.  The  financial  assessment  questionnaire  indicates  that  the \ninvestment program will have an adequate financial management system in place. Funds from \nthe ADB loan will flow directly to MOR, the executing agency, which will be responsible for \ndisbursements for the contract packages financed by ADB. \n \nF.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n7.  MOR  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  investment  program,  and  have  such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. MOR will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the \nend of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited investment program accounts and MOR \nfinancial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements \nwill include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect to investment program expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment \nof compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for investment program management, \nand (iii) an opinion on the use of the imprest fund and statement of expenditures procedure. \n \n8.  MOR  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  semiannual  progress  reports  on  program \nimplementation and on each tranche. The reports will include progress made during the review \nperiod, changes in the implementation schedule, problems encountered and remedial actions \ntaken, and subsequent activities to be undertaken.  \n \n9.  MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB within 3 months of the completion of \neach financing tranche, and a facility completion report to ADB within 6 months from physical \ncompletion of the investment program. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Imprest accounts are used in five ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n ", "    Appendix 10  53 \nG.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n10.  The  investment  program  performance  and  monitoring  system  indicators  and  their \nrelevance  were  discussed  with  MOR  during  project  preparation.  MOR  agreed  to  a  set  of \nindicators for evaluating performance in relation to its impacts, outcomes, and outputs. The \nindicators, to be reviewed at the start of implementation, will include (i) economic development \nand socioeconomic indicators, (ii) railway transport volumes, (iii) transport costs for passenger \nand freight services, (iv) energy efficiency indicators (energy consumption per unit of revenue), \n(v) environmental indicators, and (vi) accident rates. At the beginning of project implementation, \nMOR will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured \nat inception, completion, and 3 years later; and compared with the baseline (Appendix 14). The \nmain sources of data will include secondary data from government sources. MOR will submit a \nreport summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later to \nADB. \n \nH.  Investment Program Review \n \n11.  ADB and MOR will carry out review of the investment program and the periodic financing \nrequests  annually  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  economic,  and  other \nrelevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the investment program. The \nreview  will  examine  implementation  progress  and  compliance  with  assurances  in  the  loan \nagreement. \n \n ", " \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  5\n4\n   \n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nA\nItem p\np\ne\nn\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 d\nix\n 1\n1\n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The impact of the proposed investment program will be an improved transport system in \nthe region that supports socioeconomic development and the western region development \nstrategy of the Government. Providing railway transportation in underserved, less-developed, \nand poor areas will create conditions for developing local resources, employment opportunities, \nand higher incomes; and thus raise living standards in the project area. The outcome of the \ninvestment program will be an energy-efficient, safe, reliable, affordable, and environment-\nfriendly railway transport system in the southwestern region. The investment program comprises \n(i) the introduction of energy-efficient technologies, environment-friendly equipment, and safety \nequipment;  (ii)  a  review  of  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  for  integrating  energy \nefficiency and environmental issues in railway management; (iii) conducting safety and energy \naudits of a nominated railway administration; and (iv) providing capacity building support.  \n \n2.  Institutional  development  and  enhancing  staff  capacity  are  key  objectives  of  the \ninvestment program. The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) support for institutional \nand capacity development of the Ministry of Railways (MOR) and railway administration in areas \nof energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety management.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n3.  The  TA  will  (i)  review  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  for  integrating  energy \nefficiency and environmental issues in railway management and operation, compare these in \ndeveloped countries, identify the gaps, and make recommendations for MOR to implement; \n(ii) undertake safety and energy audits of a nominated railway administration, identifying areas \nwhere improvements can be made; and (iii) undertake capacity building programs to familiarize \nstaff and create awareness about energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety.  \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n4.  International consultants, supported by national consultants, will be hired to implement \nthe study. The consultants will (i) make use of similar studies undertaken by MOR; (ii) make use \nof experience in other railways (international); (iii) make use of the result of TA financed by ADB \nand  other  international  organizations;  and  (iv)  ensure  the  active  participation  of  railway \nmanagement. The consultants will undertake consultations with key stakeholders and discuss \ntheir recommendations for proposed institutional changes. For energy and safety audits, the \nconsultants will work closely with MOR and the nominated railway administration to identify the \ngaps, and make recommendations that can be adopted. Training programs, with participation \nfrom the government departments, will be organized to learn from the experience of other \nrailways abroad and create awareness about energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, \nand safety. Workshops and seminars will be organized to review and disseminate the findings of \nthe TA. The TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the government, MOR, and other \nrelevant agencies. The TA will build on ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue and will consider all \nprevious studies by the government, ADB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), the \nWorld Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral agencies.  \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n5.  The total cost of the study is estimated at $720,000. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 from the TA Special Fund-Others. MOR will finance the remaining \n ", "60 Appendix 15 \n$120,000, which will cover office accommodation and counterpart staff required to implement \nthe study.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  MOR, the executing agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring the study \nactivities. A steering committee, comprising representatives of relevant departments of MOR, \nwill be set up to oversee implementation, and provide guidance and direction to the consultants. \nIn addition, MOR will appoint a project coordinator to supervise and coordinate day-to-day \nactivities,  including  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging  meetings,  and \ncoordinating with concerned government agencies. To facilitate the work of the consultants and \nensure that MOR benefits from their experience, MOR will also provide adequate counterpart \nstaff with relevant work experience during implementation.  \n \n7.  A  team  of  international  consultants  in  association  with  national  consultants  will  be \nengaged by ADB through simplified technical proposals and quality and cost-based selection \n(80:20) according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. The TA \nwill require about 14 person-months of international and about 16 person-months of national \nconsulting services. The consultants will have expertise in institutional issues relating to energy \nefficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety as applied to the rail transport subsector. The \nconsultants will provide capacity building support through staff training, exchange visits, and \nknowledge sharing. The TA is expected to begin in May 2010 and be completed by June 2012. \nThe procurement of equipment, supplies, and materials by consultants under the study will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will \nbe turned over to MOR after the study. \n ", "    Appendix 16  61 \nTRAFFIC FORECAST AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  Since the Railway Energy Efficiency and Safety Enhancement Investment Program will \nsupport the entire railway network of the southwestern People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), its \nanalysis requires assessment of system-wide traffic forecasts for passengers and freight over \nthe  20-year  (2016\u20132035)  evaluation  period.  Rail  traffic  for  the  southwestern  region,  which \ncomprises  four  provinces  (Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan)  and  Chongqing \nMunicipality, was forecast for freight and passengers in two categories differentiated by their \neconomic impact: (i) base (normal) traffic that will benefit from improved operational efficiency, \nrepresented by an increase in the average speed of freight and passenger trains as a result of \nthe new technologies introduced by the investment program; and (ii) freight traffic diverted from \nroads and waterways, and passenger traffic diverted from roads as a result of additional line \ncapacity  available  in  the  southwestern  region  railway  network  as  a  result  of  the  new \ntechnologies introduced by the investment program. The traffic forecast was based on a two-tier \nanalysis: (i) regional transport demand, based on the relative network rail line share of the total \nnational  rail  network,  and  (ii)  estimated  traction  power  needed  and  its  energy  source \n \ncomponents.Traffic projections considered expected economic growth, increase in new rail line \ndevelopment in the southwestern region as part of the economic stimulus program, and market \nsurveys and assessments of technical assistance consultants and the Asian Development Bank \nmissions.  \n \n2.  The railway network length in the southwestern region is forecast to increase from \n11,344 kilometers (km) as of the beginning of 2008 (14.6% of the national railway network) to \n17,939 km (18.7% of the national network) by 2015 (Table A16.1). This represents annual \ngrowth of 5.9% compared to the national rail network growth of 2.6% per year during the same \n2008\u20132015 period. After 2015, the national network length is expected to grow by 0.8% annually \nwhile the regional network length is projected to grow by 2.5% per year. As a result, the base \n(normal) traffic in the southwestern region will increase from 271.16 million tons in 2007 to \n492.79 million tons in 2015. The share of the southwestern region in national railway freight \ntraffic will increase from 10.3% in 2007 to 13.3% in 2015 in terms of tons and from 11.0% to \n14.2% in terms of ton-km. By 2035, freight traffic in the region is forecast to reach 1.18 billion \ntons (18.4% of total railway freight traffic). \n \n3.  Regional passenger traffic will experience similar growth from 147.7 million passengers \nin 2007 to 1.71 billion passengers by 2035. The share of passengers in the national railway \ntraffic is expected to increase from 11.5% in 2007 to 14.8% in 2015 and 20.5% in 2035. In terms \nof passenger-km, the corresponding values are 9.3% in 2007, 11.9% in 2015, and 16.5% in \n2035. These growth trends are consistent with the government\u2019s western region development \nstrategy.  \n \n4.  Diverted freight traffic is expected to be 19.05 billion ton-km in 2016, increasing to \n26.61 billion ton-km by 2020 and 70.78 billion ton-km by 2035. Some 80% of the diverted traffic \nis assumed to be from roads, with the remaining amount from waterways. In terms of passenger \ntraffic,  the  diversion  is  assumed  to  be  from  roads  only  since  the  share  of  waterways  in \npassenger  transport  is  negligible.  Diverted  passenger  traffic  is  forecast  at  6.69  billion \npassenger-km  in  2016,  increasing  to  7.91  billion  passenger-km  in  2020  and  26.22  billion \npassenger-km in 2035.  \n \n5.  In terms of traction power, the southwestern region is unique: currently, 30% of traction \nis  by  electric  locomotives  and  70%  by  diesel.  Electric  locomotives  are  preferred  because \n(i) higher traction power is generated by electric locomotives in the largely mountainous terrain; \n(ii) 70% of electricity generation in the region is through hydroelectric power, whereas the \n ", "62  Appendix 16 \nnational  average  is  only  16%;1 and  (iii)  electric  locomotive  is  more  environment\u2013friendly, \nespecially in the southwestern region where (a) 50% of the mainline is in tunnels with diesel \nlocomotives  causing  serious  emission  problems  and  ventilation  challenges,  (b)  diesel \nlocomotives leak fuel and lubricants causing serious environmental damage and high clean-up \ncost, (c) diesel fumes in tunnels cause irritation to passengers, and (d) diesel locomotives \ndischarge  air  pollutants.  As  a  result,  the  southwestern  region  railways  (Chengdu  railway \nadministration,  Kunming  railway  administration,  and  Nanning  railway  administration)  have \nadopted a goal of increasing electric power traction to 50% by 2020 and 90% by 2035. As \nshown in Table A16.1, diesel freight locomotives will increase from 538 in 2007 to 1,094 by \n2020, and decrease to 502 by 2035, fewer than the level in 2007. Diesel-powered passenger \nlocomotives and diesel multiple units will increase from 276 in 2007 to 637 in 2020, and \ndecrease to 363 in 2035. On the other hand, electric freight locomotives will increase steadily \nfrom 122 in 2007 to 580 in 2020 and 2,394 in 2035; passenger locomotives will increase from \n64 in 2007 to 343 in 2020 and 2,762 in 2035. \n \n6.  Traffic forecasts are considered reasonable, given that (i) the regional railway network is \nan important transport corridor connecting the western PRC with the east as well as serving as \na gateway to the PRC\u2013Eurasian and Greater Mekong Subregion rail network for intermodal and \ninternational transport; (ii) railways in the PRC have experienced high annual traffic growth, with \nrecent rates higher than the assumed growth rates for freight and passenger traffic; (iii) the new \naccelerated investments in the southwestern railway network will reduce the widespread line \ncapacity constraints that have limited the growth potential of railway transport in the past, \nallowing the railway to carry more freight and passengers; and (iv) operational improvements in \npassenger and freight train speeds will continue to encourage more passenger and shipper \npreference for rail transport in the southwestern region.  \n \nB.   Economic Evaluation \n \n7.  Alternative analysis. Possible alternative interventions were considered to meet the \ngrowing transport demand in the southwestern region as part of the national and regional \ntransport network plans. Alternative analysis reviewed various options in terms of transport \nmodes and technical characteristics. While enhancing the existing road capacity may be an \noption to partly meet the increasing demand, it will not completely satisfy the various kinds of \ntraffic, particularly bulk cargo such as coal, over long distances to meet the needs of a growing \neconomy.  Besides  the  higher  initial  cost,  increased  land  requirements,  high  air  pollution \nimpacts, fuel consumption, and user costs make the road alternative less viable. The technical \ncharacteristics  of  the  equipment  were  considered  based  on  safety  and  energy  efficiency \nimprovements, consistency with the standards, forecast traffic, and plans of the regional railway \nadministrations to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact.  \n \n8.  The economic evaluation comprises a \u201cwith-project\u201d scenario that includes the initial \ninvestment in the first and subsequent tranches of the investment program, and annual fixed \nand variable operating costs including regular and overhaul maintenance of equipment. The \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario is implicit to the analysis. The with-project scenario is based on the \nanalysis of equipment included in the investment program, including rail grinding machinery, \ntelecommunication system equipment, intelligent power supply system for signaling, overhead \ncatenary and traction substation systems, electric power supply equipment, noise barriers, \ninfrared hot box detection system, and track car sets. The with-project scenario is based on the \nimproved  response  and  restoration  times  resulting  from  the  proposed  investment  program \ncompared to current response and restoration capabilities. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  McKinsey and Company. 2009. China\u2019s Green Opportunity. Beijing (May). \n ", "    Appendix 16  63 \n9.  Cost. The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of with- and without-project \nscenarios,  using  constant  2009  economic  prices.  Under  the  without-project  scenario,  it  is \nassumed that the diverted traffic estimated under the with-project scenario would continue \nmoving by road and waterway (for freight) and by road (for passengers).  \n \n10.  The analysis is based on passenger and freight traffic that would be diverted from bus \ntransport for passengers, and truck and waterway transport for freight. The project benefits and \ncost were revalued in economic prices by separating the cost items into tradable materials and \nequipment, non-tradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan (CNY) \nusing the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign \nexchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to put an economic value on the \nwages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled \nworkers exists. \n \n11.  Benefits.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for  diverted  freight  and \npassenger traffic; (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic from buses, trucks, \nand waterways; (iii) time savings for base freight and passenger traffic resulting from operational \nimprovements;  (iv)  pollution  reduction  benefits;  (v)  energy  savings;  (vi)  avoided  road \ninfrastructure and maintenance costs; and (vii) avoided road accidents.  \n \n12.  For diverted passenger traffic from road (5.69 billion passenger-km in 2016), the user \ncost saving (CNY270.41 million in 2016) is the difference in the passenger economic fare \nbetween road and rail transport (CNY0.0475 per passenger-km). Passenger traffic time savings \n(CNY227.14  million  in  2016)  are  computed  for  base  and  diverted  traffic  (160.18  billion \npassenger-km in 2016). Time savings are due to the response and restoration time of safety \nequipment, which is estimated at 4.61 hours per incident for estimated 70 incidents in 2016 \n(73 in 2020, 85 in 2035). New safety equipment included in the investment program allows \nfaster  response  time  to  accidents  and  shorter  time  to  clear  the  track  under  with-project \nconditions. When additional track access is provided, line capacity is increased, allowing the \nrailway to move more freight and passenger trains through the network. This is the diverted \ntraffic  under  with-project  conditions,  which  is  multiplied  by  the  economic  price  difference \nbetween rail and road transport to estimate safety enhancement benefits. In addition, safety \nenhancement benefits include time savings to passengers and freight as a result of faster \ntransport under with-project conditions. \n \n13.  For  freight traffic  diverted  from  trucks  (15.24 billion  ton-km  in  2016),  the  economic \nbenefit (CNY1.75 billion in 2016) is the difference in shipper economic costs between truck and \nrail  transport  (CNY0.115  per  ton-km).  For  freight  traffic  diverted  from  inland  waterway \n(3.81 billion ton-km in 2016), the economic benefit (CNY\u201345.73 million in 2016) is the difference \nin shipper economic costs between inland waterway and rail transport (CNY\u20130.012 per ton-km). \nFor freight time savings benefit (CNY2.90 billion in 2016), an adjusted economic value added \nranging from CNY2,610 per ton for non-containerized bulk cargo (coal, fertilizer, crude oil, \npetroleum  products,  steel,  and  grains)  to  CNY16,063  per  ton  for  containerized cargo  was \ncomputed based on current financial value, non-tax elements, and shadow exchange rate \nfactor. The adjusted economic values per ton represent the net economic value, i.e., the value \nof output at economic prices less the costs of production (sum of all intermediate input costs, \nwages, and annualized investment costs). \n \n14.  The diversion of traffic under the with-project conditions will help avoid some costs that \nwould not be possible in the absence of the proposed investment program. The economic \nanalysis estimated three such cases of cost avoidance: (i) avoided highway investment costs \n(initial investment of CNY578.50 million in 2016, with annual incremental investments ranging \nfrom CNY34.46 million in 2017 to CNY69.36 million in 2035 to accommodate increased traffic \n ", "64  Appendix 16 \nevery year); (ii) avoided highway routine and periodic maintenance costs (CNY132.80 million in \n2016  increasing  to  CNY525.67  million  in  2035);  and  (iii)  avoided  road  accident  costs \n(CNY11.83 million  in  2016  increasing  to  CNY46.84  million  in  2035).  Under  without-project \nconditions,  there  would  be  no  traffic  diverted  from  road  to  rail.  Therefore,  additional  road \ncapacity in the form of either new roads or expansion of existing roads would be required, \nresulting in additional initial investment and recurring maintenance costs. These costs under \nwithout-project conditions are avoided under with-project conditions.  \n \n15.  Energy and pollution benefits have also been estimated for the proposed investment \nprogram. The project components include investment in machinery and new technology that are \nmore energy efficient than the current rail transport technology. Therefore, for the base traffic, \nthe energy savings represent the difference between the existing and new rail technology. With \nrespect to diverted traffic from road to rail, the energy savings represent the difference of energy \nefficiency between road transport and improved rail transport under with-project conditions. With \nthe diversion of freight and passengers from road to rail, there will be benefits from reduced \npollution from trucks, buses, and cars as well as less energy used by the transport sector. \nBased on recent research conducted by the International Energy Agency, the traction power mix \nin the region, and the regional electricity production mix between hydro and thermal coal, the \nnumber of tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) per traffic unit for road and rail were computed for the \n2\nsouthwestern region (Table A16.2). These savings for rail compared with road were found to be \n21.4 tons of CO  per million traffic units in 2007 and 22.6 tons of CO  per million traffic units in \n2 2\n2020 for electric locomotives. This value has been included in the benefit stream (CNY1.51 \nmillion in 2016, increasing to CNY882.37 million in 2035). In addition, the savings of reduced \ntotal fuel consumption as a result of diverting traffic from road (CNY25.81 million in 2016, \nincreasing  to  CNY99.91  million  in  2035)  and  base  traffic  due  to  improvements  in  energy \nefficiency  as  a  result  of  the  equipment  included  in  the  proposed  investment  program \n(CNY910.19 million in 2016, increasing to CNY3.08 billion in 2035) have been computed and \nincluded in the benefit stream. Unit operating costs for rail transport have been adjusted to \nexclude fuel costs in order to eliminate double counting of this benefit. \n \n16.  Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the proposed investment \nprogram is 26.81%, with the net present value using a discount rate of 12% amounting to \nCNY40.41 billion  (Table  A16.3).  Sensitivity  analysis  tested  eight  scenarios  to  assess  the \nrobustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A16.4). The initial capital cost would \nhave to be more than 304% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of \n12%. Considering the experience of Asian Development Bank-financed projects in the railway \nsector, this switching value is unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to decrease \nalmost  92%  to  make  the  investment  program  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in \ncompletion does not affect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and \ncosts  were  also  tested.  The  results  showed  that  the  proposed  investment  program  would \nmaintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n ", "    Appendix 16  65 \nTable A16.1: Traffic

Appendix 17  67 \nSAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  This safeguards framework was prepared for the proposed Railway Energy Efficiency \nand  Safety  Enhancement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. The investment program proposes utilizing multitranche financing facility of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). This framework is to guide the Ministry of Railways (MOR), \nthe executing agency, in the safeguard assessment of tranches included under the investment \nprogram to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \nB.  Types of Schemes to be Assessed \n2.  The IP comprises (i) introduction of (a) energy-efficient technologies, (b) environmentally \nfriendly  equipment,  and  (c)  safety  equipment;  (ii)  a  review  of  the  existing  institutional \narrangements for integrating energy efficiency and environmental issues in railway management; \n(iii)  conducting  safety  and  energy  audits  of  a  nominated  railway  administration;  and \n(iv) providing  capacity  building  support.  ADB  will  finance  (i)  procurement  of  more  energy-\nefficient  equipment  and  material  than  that  is  currently  in  use;  (ii)  procurement  of  modern \nenvironmental equipment; (iii) procurement of equipment that will enhance maintenance and \nsafety  and  can  respond  to  emergencies  more  quickly,  efficiently,  and  effectively;  and \n(iv) capacity building, including staff training.  \n \nC.  Safeguard Review Procedure \n3.  Responsibilities  and  authorities. MOR will be responsible for the overall program \nimplementation. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, under MOR, will coordinate \nthe project management office's tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and \nreporting vis-\u00e0-vis ADB. A steering committee headed by Director General, Foreign Capital and \nTechnical Import Center will be responsible for the selection of the projects for subsequent \nfinancing  by  ADB,  and  their  implementation,  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  in \nSchedule 4 item 1(iv) and (v).  \n \n4.  The investment program will consider only proven energy efficiency technologies, safety \nenhancement  equipment  and  materials,  and  environmental  equipment  conforming  to  the \nselection criteria. These could include: (i) electric power and traction equipment; (ii) railway \nelectrification  equipment;  (iii)  traction  substation  system;  (iv) signaling  system; \n(v) telecommunication  system;  (vi) environmental  protection  equipment;  (vii)  operation  and \nmaintenance equipment; (viii) specialized track materials and equipment; and (ix) any other \nmaterial  or  equipment  that  will  improve  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability  and \nsafety.  \n \n5.  Safeguard assessment. The investment program section criteria in Schedule 4 requires \nthat equipment installation should not involve land acquisition, or have adverse impacts on \nethnic minorities, or have negative environmental impacts. The first tranche of the investment \nprogram is classified as category C for all the safeguard aspects (environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and ethnic minorities).  \n \n6.  During preparation of subsequent tranches, MOR will assess the potential safeguard \nimpacts from the tranche to ensure they are category C for all the safeguard aspects. The \ncategorization will be confirmed by ADB before approval of the tranche. \n ", "68  Appendix 18 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Railway Energy Efficiency and Safety Enhancement Investment \nProgram \n \nLending/Financing  Project \u2013 Multitranche Financing  Department/  East Asia Department/ \nModality:  Facility  Division:  Transport Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe proposed investment program is consistent with two of the four pillars of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):a (i) inclusive growth and balanced development, and \n(ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. The investment program reflects (i) network development, which will \nenhance capacity and reduce bottlenecks; (ii) improved energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, by providing a \nmore efficient and environment-friendly mode of transport in the region; (iii) enhanced safety through the provision of a reliable \nand safe mode of transport; (iv) support for the PRC railway development plan and the western region development strategy; \nand (v) promotion of pro-poor economic growth in the region, thereby reducing poverty. The investment program emphasizes \nenergy conservation, environmental sustainability, and safety through the introduction of safe and reliable technology on the \nrailway network, which will result in improved reliability, higher mobility, increased network capacity, optimal use of the \nnetwork and assets, and increased staff productivity. All of these will lead to higher efficiency of the railway network.  \nEnergy-efficient, environment-friendly, and safe railway transport will benefit all passengers. The poor will benefit equally or \nmore from the intervention.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                       Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the southwestern PRC. Poverty in this \narea is caused by adverse environmental and weather conditions and limited farmland (e.g., mountains, cold weather, water \nscarcity, and soil erosion); geographical remoteness and isolation and high transport costs; and lack of access to markets, \ngood education, and health care facilities. Railway network development has direct and indirect impacts for poor families to \n(i) move away from unsustainable, mountainous farmlands; (ii) have better access to markets, and advanced educational and \nhealth facilities, especially for women; and (iii) build a sustainable future in centers of economic activity. \n \n2.  Design Features  \nThe investment program will be implemented in the southwestern PRC, a relatively poor area. The region is largely \nmountainous with abundant natural reserves of coal, and other nonferrous materials; and famous tourist sites. In spite of \nabundant natural resources, many people are poor and the economic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty has failed to \ndevelop because of inadequate transport services and high costs. The railway density is the lowest in the region and local \ngovernments and people living in the region see the railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. Railway \ndevelopment is part of the government\u2019s program for the integrated development of transportation facilities in this poor region \nand the Ministry of Railways (MOR) plans to develop 6,500 kilometers (km) of railways in the region by 2015. The proposed \nregion also shares borders with Viet Nam, and Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are part of the Greater Mekong Subregion. \nThe development of railways is expected to play an important role in facilitating and integrating this poor and underdeveloped \nregion, and stimulating regional and interprovincial trade and movement of people. The investment program is a priority \ninvestment included in the government\u2019s proposed Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the stimulus package announced in October \n2008.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe interior regions of the PRC have not benefited as much from economic growth and reforms as the east coast; in fact, the \ngap between economic and social development in those regions has increased. Transport constraints and high logistics costs \ncontribute to the economic disparities between the regions and prevent the southwestern region from capitalizing on its \ncomparative advantages. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  investment  program  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the  region  that  supports \nsocioeconomic development and the western region development strategy. Providing economic railway transportation in less \ndeveloped and poor areas will create conditions for developing local resources, employment opportunities, and higher \nincomes; and thus contribute to improved living standards for people in the southwestern PRC. \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations with the government and other stakeholders indicate strong support for the investment program.

Manila. \n ", "    Appendix 18  69 \nthe region see the railway development as a key investment in integrating this poor and underdeveloped region with the rest \nof the country. As noted above, all railway users will benefit from improved reliability, safer, cleaner, and more affordable \nmode of transport. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe investment program will positively impact the national railway network, and all railway users will benefit. Therefore, a \nparticipation strategy is not necessary. \n \nC.  Gender and Development\n \n1.  Key Issues  \nRailway development generates job opportunities (skilled and unskilled) for the poor, ethnic minorities, women, and other \nvulnerable groups, which helps develop their job skills. Job opportunities provide potential new sources of income for local \nresidents. Increase in female participation in the labor and tourism market increases women\u2019s net income and savings, \nimproves overall family welfare, and helps improve women\u2019s status. Women and other vulnerable groups benefit from railway \ndevelopment and have equal access to employment and wages. Railway development generates demand for local labor and \nincreases  worker  productivity  and  wages.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  helps  generate  additional \nemployment opportunities for both men and women, close to their homes.  \n \n2.  Key Actions  \nMeasures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use of relevant \nservices, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n  Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nIII.
