The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will build financial management \ncapacity and help boost the quality of financial due diligence (FDD) to improve the financial \nsustainability of projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It will also help improve \nfinancial management throughout the project cycle in ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia developing \nmember countries (DMCs).1 This will be achieved through enhanced guidance to project teams \nand hands-on support to executing and/or implementing agencies, through strategically placed \nregional consultants2 in ADB\u2019s resident missions who will support ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment Office of the Director General, Portfolio, Results, Safeguards, and Gender Unit \n(CWOD-PSG) to ensure FDD quality. This TA broadly complements efforts of ADB\u2019s Public \nFinancial Management Division under the Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management \nDepartment (PFFM) to strengthen institutional financial management practices through capacity \nbuilding activities, integrated fiduciary risk assessments, and strengthening of country systems.3 \n \n2.  The  2019  Annual  Portfolio  Performance  Report4  highlighted the  need to  strengthen \nfinancial management in the project cycle and continue to build DMCs\u2019 financial management \ncapacity.  The  2019  Annual  Financial  Management  Report5  details  how  robust  financial \nmanagement practices contribute to ADB executing its fiduciary responsibility effectively and \nimplementing projects and programs successfully. It concludes that ADB\u2019s financial management \nfunction has been strengthened from 2017 to 2019, but momentum must be maintained to \nmainstream financial management practices in ADB operations. Through the proposed TA, ADB \nwill work closely with DMCs and continue to provide hands-on support to project team leaders \nand executing and/or implementing agencies to improve project FDD during processing and \nstrengthen the monitoring of financial compliance. \n \n3.  The TA is not included in the country operations business plans as it is regional. It is well \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20306  operational  priority  for  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity of DMCs. The TA will also continue to address the request7 of the Office of \nthe President to heads of departments to strengthen financial management.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Robust FDD during project processing will help DMCs strengthen their decision-making \ncapacity to design, finance, and implement ADB-funded projects and programs; improve the \nfinancial compliance, sustainability, and viability of the implementing projects; contribute to more \nsuccessful outcomes; and provide a greater development impact. Increased attention to the \neffectiveness  of  financial  support  and  financial  sustainability  requires  enhanced  fiduciary \noversight of funds, and increased fiduciary accountability and responsibility of DMCs, to manage \nfinancial risks better.  \n \n \n1 ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department covers Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  The TA may recruit regional consultants with specific expertise in ADB public financial management, auditing, and \nfinancial reporting requirements in groups of countries under ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department. \n3  ADB. 2020.

From  2016  to  20019,  the  region  has  experienced  significant  structural  reforms  by \nunbundling  entities  and  creating  new  companies  in  revenue-generating  segments.  These \nchanges require comprehensive FDD and the development of robust financial management \naction plans (FMAPs) to mitigate financial risks. Such structural changes will necessitate deeper, \ncomprehensive, and more frequent engagement and hands-on support by financial management \nexperts  with  executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  and  auditors  during  project  design, \nprocessing, and implementation.  \n \n6.  Most Central and West Asia DMCs are in transition to adopting the International Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRS) or the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and \naligning their national accounting standards with the IFRS and/or IPSAS. This transition is \nchallenging because of limited local expertise and lack of comprehensive manuals for executing \nand/or implementing agencies. Additionally, many governance risk assessments for Central and \nWest Asia DMCs have identified weak internal audit and internal control country systems. To \nmitigate the risks, the TA will enable the recruitment of consultants to provide (i) hands-on support \nto executing and/or implementing agencies  in setting up project implementation units, and \n(ii) guidance throughout the projects to ensure adequate financial compliance. \n \n7.   ADB  has  previously  made  efforts  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  executing  and/or \nimplementing agencies and external auditors in DMCs through targeted  training programs, \nresulting in improved timely submission of audited project financial statements (APFSs) and \naudited entity financial statements (AEFSs). However, challenges remain to ensure acceptable \nquality, improve compliance with financial covenants, and enhance the monitoring of financial \nmitigating measures for better project outcomes.  \n \n8.  Finally,  many  financial  management  assessments  result  in  pre-mitigated  substantial \nfinancial management risks, and require the implementation of time-bound FMAPs that need \nclose monitoring and require strong guidance to executing and/or implementing agencies on their \nimplementation.  The  TA  consultants  will  provide  hands-on  guidance  to  executing  and/or \nimplementing agencies to strengthen the monitoring of FMAPs under the projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improvements in public expenditure efficiency \nin Central and West Asia DMCs. The TA will have the following outcome: portfolio performance \nin Central and West Asia DMCs improved.  \n \nB.   Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Financial due diligence strengthened. This output will (i) improve quality \nassurance processes for FDD during project processing, including conducting comprehensive \nreviews and updates of financial management assessments, and financial analysis and financial \nevaluations, for better financial sustainability; and (ii) provide quality assurance review for entities\u2019 \nfinancial information for better quality FDD.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Financial  reporting  compliance  improved.  This  output  will  (i)  provide \nguidance to executing and/or implementing agencies on ADB-funded projects\u2019 financial reporting \nrequirements; (ii) monitor FMAP implementation and updates; (iii) ensure that APFSs and/or \nAEFSs are submitted on time and are of acceptable quality; (iv) provide advisory services to the \n ", "  3 \n \nentities in the conversion of national accounting standards to IFRS reporting, as needed; and (v) \nprovide specialized guidance to new executing and implementing agencies on the IPSAS, project \nfinancial management, and project internal audit and internal control requirements. \n \n12.  The TA will (i) strengthen executing and/or implementing agencies\u2019 capacity by providing \nguidance on project financial management, (ii) support quality assurance processes for FDD \nduring project processing, and (iii) enhance the monitoring of FMAPs and the timely submission \nof APFSs and/or AEFSs during implementation. The TA will also ensure the participation of \nfemale staff during executing and/or implementing agencies\u2019 guidance and advisory sessions, \nwhich will be monitored as part of the design and monitoring framework. In addition, it will enable \ncentralized quality assurance, focusing on the FDD and financial compliance of all DMCs, which \nwill improve project implementation financial management aspects as well as mitigating financial \nmanagement risks for future projects. \n \n13.  TA  management  activities  will  be  continuous  throughout  the  TA,  including  the \nadministration and management of consulting contracts, TA reviews, and monitoring. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($250,000 from the TASF 6 and $50,000 from TASF-other \nsources). \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  Under the close guidance and supervision of the CWOD-PSG financial management due \ndiligence group, three individual regional consultants will be recruited on an intermittent basis for \n12 person-months each, with possible extensions. The consultants will be placed in ADB\u2019s \nresident missions to (i) support quality assurance processes for FDD during project processing; \n(ii) conduct FDD, on a needs basis; and (iii) provide support to project implementation units for \nsetting up financial management systems and monitoring of FMAP actions. \n \n16.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  implementation  November 2020\u2013November 2023 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  CWOD-PSG \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual Selection  Regional Experts  $ 270,000 \n \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time \nto time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CWOD-PSG = ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department\u2019s Office of the Director \nGeneral, Portfolio, Results, Safeguards, and Gender Unit; FDD = financial due diligence; ICS = individual consultant \nselection; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n ", "4 \n17.  Consulting services. The individual consultants will be engaged competitively. ADB will \nengage the consultants8 following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and its associated staff instructions. The TA will commence in the respective DMCs upon \nwritten confirmation that the government does not object to ADB financing of the TA.9  \n \n18.  The TA scope will be reassessed in 2021. Subject to the results of this assessment and \nfunding availability, potential avenues for expansion include (i) additional consultants; (ii) the \ndevelopment of specialized project financial management manuals to provide guidance on ADB \nrequirements  in  English,  with  translations  to  local  and/or  regional  languages;  and  (iii)  the \ndevelopment of an internal audit manual.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Financial Management in Central and West Asia,  and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n \n8 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n9 ADB. 2019.
