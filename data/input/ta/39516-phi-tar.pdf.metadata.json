INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strengthening of decentralization policy and enhancing the ability of local government \nunits  (LGUs)  to  deliver  services  are  core  elements  of  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term \nPhilippine Development Plan, 2004\u20132010.1 These objectives also represent one of the key \npillars of the country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 and country operations business plan \n2010\u20132012  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).2 This  policy  and  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) falls under the long-standing Local Government Financing and Budget Reform \n(LGFBR) Program and is linked to supporting achievement of important policy actions for the \nproposed  Second  Local  Government  Financing  and  Budget  Reform  Program  (LGFBR  2) \nscheduled in 2012. The TA follows on from several earlier TA projects under the LGFBR series \nof programs, with additional support warranted by the breadth and depth of the decentralization \nreform  program  being  pursued.  Preparation  of  this  TA  is  referenced  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation  of  the  President  for  the  proposed  LGFBR  subprogram  2,  which  will  be \ndiscussed by the ADB Board of Directors in November 2009.3 A fact-finding mission for the TA \nwas fielded from 8 to 19 June 2009, and agreement was reached with the Government on the \npurpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  financing  of  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since the 1990s, the Government has pursued major decentralization reforms through \ndevolution of authority, functional assignments, and funding to LGUs. An estimated 25% of all \npublic expenditures in the Philippines are now managed directly by LGUs. Since 2004, one ADB \nloan, along with several TA projects, has been approved to support decentralization efforts.5 A \njoint study on decentralized service delivery was conducted by ADB and the World Bank, which \nestablished the issues that served as a basis for support through the LGFBR program.6 The \nLGFBR  subprogram  1  loan,  covering  2006\u20132007,  focused  on  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy \nreforms in five core areas: (i) intergovernmental fiscal relations; (ii) fiscal management, planning, \nand  expenditure  management;  (iii)  LGU  performance  measurement  and  service  delivery; \n(iv) credit financing; and (v) local own source revenues. A single tranche program loan of \n$300 million was disbursed in late 2007 based on achievement of agreed actions over 2006\u2013\n2007.  \n \n3.  The  LGFBR  program  contributed  to  fiscal  consolidation,  good  governance,  and \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by (i) lessening LGU dependence on national \ngovernment  transfers  through  enhanced  predictability  of  resource  flows  and  improved \nmobilization of own source revenues, (ii) supporting improved delivery of essential services \nthrough better LGU access to developmental credit, and (iii) supporting improved governance \nby establishing transparent and accountable LGU financial and administrative management \n                                                                                                          \n1  Government  of  Philippines,  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority.  2004.

Manila. \n ", "2     \nsystems for coordinated development planning. One of the key lessons coming out of the \nLGFBR program is the need for continuous capacity building through new TA projects for local \nfinance reforms to take hold. A new approach would be to establish LGU learning networks that \nwill allow stronger LGUs to mentor weaker ones through structured training programs. The \nMayor\u2019s Development Center (MDC) established by the League of Municipalities has already \ntaken steps in this area by sharing the expertise of ex-mayors who have performed well to its \nmembers through funding by various development partners. The proposed TA will work with \nMDC and examine the feasibility of establishing and utilizing such networks for a program of \ntraining  and  mentoring.  Such  programs  can  also  result  in  the  institutionalization  of  formal \nperformance improvement contracts similar to those used in Naga City.7 \n \n4.  The LGFBR subprogram 2 loan covering 2008\u20132009 was approved on 26 November \n2009. The regulatory framework, including lower-level instruments, has almost been finalized, \npolicy reform has been enhanced to remove distortions and anomalies, and local capacity \nbuilding programs have been launched. Various TA projects have helped continue the policy \ndialogue, addressing gaps and constraints in the five LGFBR core areas as well as building \ncapacity.8 On local own-source revenues and credit financing, Local Government Finance and \nBudget Reform TA laid a firm foundation for fiscal management tools and systems to be used by \nthe  Bureau  of  Local  Government  Finance  (BLGF)  and  LGUs  to  improve  LGU  access  to \nfinancing. Key among these is refinement of the statement of receipts and expenditures (SRE), \nwhich  is  part  of  the  creditworthiness  indicators  system  and  is  used  for  creditworthiness \nevaluation by public and private creditors.  \n \n5.  On  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  local  resource  mobilization,  expenditure \nmanagement, and LGU performance measurement, the TA on Local Governance and Fiscal \nManagement  significantly  reduced  the  release  time  for  LGU  shares  in  national  wealth, \nrecommended  improvements  in  the  use  of  the  Special  Education  Fund,  and  refined  the \narchitecture  of  the  Local  Governance  Performance  Management  System  (LGPMS).  On \nplanning, Strengthening Provincial and Local Planning and Expenditure Management TA is \nsupporting implementation of Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 of 2007.9 The TA will use \nprovincial and local planning and expenditure management guidelines to produce outputs, i.e., \nprovincial  development  and  physical  framework  plans,  provincial  development  investment \nprograms, and feasibility studies of important projects. The Local Government Finance and \nBudget Reform TA is addressing gaps in planning and performance measurement by training \ntrainers for cities and municipalities and improving the reporting system for the LGPMS. In \naddition, the TA facilitated formalization of the Coordination Committee on Decentralization \n(CCD), which is now the national and local forum for brainstorming policies and programs in the \nLGU sector.  \n \n                                                                                                          \n7  Naga City is a first income class city in the Bicol Region (Region 5) of the Philippines. It has the most advanced \nand transparent governance monitoring of any local government in the country. The local government entered into \na customer service covenant with it\u2019s constituents and regularly posts the achievements of the service delivery \noutcome such as infrastructure and business and investments as well as financial and expenditure data on their \nwebsite.

Manila (TA 4778-PHI, for $1.8 million, \napproved on 3 April); and ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening \nProvincial and Local Planning and Expenditure Management Phase 2. Manila (TA 7074-PHI, for $650,000, \napproved on 4 April). \n9  The  joint memorandum circular cosigned by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), \nDepartment of Finance (DOF), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and National Economic and \nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA)  provides  guidelines  on  LGU  planning,  investment  programming,  revenue \nadministration, budgeting, and expenditure management. \n ", "      3 \n6.  The proposed LGFBR 2 focuses on central government institutional strengthening and \nlocal  government  capacity  building,  and  deepening  reforms  in  four  core  areas:  (i)  fiscal \nmanagement, planning, and public expenditure management; (ii) performance measurement \nand service delivery; (iii) credit financing; and (iv) local own source revenues. Building on the \nresults of the previous TA projects, the proposed TA will facilitate completion of the LGFBR 2 \npolicy triggers, which are designed to address remaining gaps and constraints. On financial \nmanagement, the TA will refine the SRE by developing cash flow forecasting templates for \nLGUs and implementing a competency certification system. On credit financing, the TA will \nenhance the use of creditworthiness indicators by drafting guidelines for its use in prioritization \nand investment programming. On own source revenues, the TA will improve collection of local \nbusiness taxes by using presumptive business tax methods. The TA will continue to assist the \nCCD in addressing policy issues and constraints not only related to the LGFBR program but \nalso for the broader LGU medium-term agenda of the next administration (Appendix 4 maps the \ncapacity-building areas of the ongoing and proposed TA projects to LGFBR 2).    \n \n7.   Development partner coordination was achieved through participation in the Philippines \nDevelopment  Forum  and  consultation  with  key  government  agencies  (footnote  8).  Forum \ndiscussions provided the spectrum of projects related to the four core areas in which other \ndevelopment partners are working (Appendix 4, Table A4); the government agencies provided \nrecommendations for priority activities within the four core areas. Participation in the forum and \nconsultation with key agencies has not only prevented duplication of effort but also ensured best \nvalue addition. The support to the CCD also ensured that development partner interventions in \nthe same policy area are complementary. For example, the CCD is discussing measures to \nadvance LGU credit access reforms identified in the official development assistance study of \nADB10 and the policy-based grant system report of the World Bank.11 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be increased efficiency and effectiveness of basic public \nservices delivered by LGUs to their constituent communities. The expected outcome of the TA \nis to assist LGUs to develop enhanced capacities to plan and budget for the general welfare of \ntheir constituent communities in a transparent and accountable way. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented with intermittent inputs over 18 months, commencing in \nApril 2010. It will provide analytical inputs, system development, and institutional capacity-\nbuilding support to BLGF and Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO), Department of \nBudget and Management (DBM), and Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), \nas  CCD  chair,  to  further  strengthen  their  capabilities  to  support  LGUs  in  improving  local \nresource mobilization, expenditure management, and service delivery reforms.

Improving Access to Public and Private Sources of Capital for Financing of \nPolicy Reforms and Development Projects \n \n11.  This component will assist BLGF and MDFO to \n(i)  design  and  conduct  a  regional  office-based  trainers\u2019  training  involving  BLGF \nregional staff on the use of financing modalities and debt management manuals \nand BLGF\u2019s creditworthiness and debt capacity certification process; \n(ii)  prepare  guidelines  on  the  use  of  creditworthiness  indicators  as  prioritization \ncriteria for development investment programming; \n(iii)  support the system design and programming services for computerization of all \nMDFO administrative and operational functions, including loan applications and \nprocessing; \n(iv)  train MDFO personnel on the application of the financing modalities manual, debt \nmanagement  manual,  and  on  the conduct of project  financial  and  economic \nevaluation for prototype projects; and \n(v)  provide  technical  advisory  services  to  MDFO  Program  Governing  Board  for \npolicy formulation and review, especially covering (a) policy for syndication of \nLGU loans with private financial institutions, (b) revised interest rate policy, and \n(c) policy for addressing delinquent LGUs. \n \n3.  Reducing  Dependency  on  Internal  Revenue  Allotment  by  Developing \nBuoyant Sources of Revenue at the Local Level \n \n12.  This component will support BLGF and DBM to \n(i)  develop guidelines for building a local business taxpayer database to be issued \nto LGU treasurers; the guidelines will be field validated in a province, a city, a \nfirst\u2013second class municipality, and a third\u2013sixth class municipality;12 \n(ii)  develop guidelines on the use of presumptive gross sales figures to calculate the \nbusiness tax liability of business establishments to be issued to LGU treasurers;  \n                                                                                                          \n12 LGUs are categorized into six classes on the basis of income; first class being the richest. \n ", "      5 \n(iii)  develop a prototype program for LGUs for the local business taxpayer database \nand for application of the presumptive business income tax at the LGU level; and \n(iv)  develop a technical supplement to the UBOM setting out implementation details \nfor establishing local government economic enterprises. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe government will finance the remaining $300,000 equivalent in kind as office space and staff \ntime. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The executing agency for the TA will be BLGF whereas DBM, MDFO, and DILG (as \nCCD chair) will be the implementing agencies. An interagency project steering committee (PSC) \nwill be organized to coordinate the TA activities; its membership will be drawn from BLGF, DBM, \nMDFO, DILG, LGU leagues, and participating LGUs. The PSC, together with the ADB project \nofficer and project team leader, will meet at least quarterly to review written project assessments \nof  implementation  progress,  including  actions  to  rectify  problems  as  recommended  by  a \ntechnical review committee (TRC) comprising four senior staff members\u2014one each from DBM, \nBLGF, DILG, and MDFO. The TRC will also conduct the staff review of the TA outputs prior to \nthe meeting with the PSC. \n \n15.  To implement the TA, the following consulting services will be required: 52 person-\nmonths of national consultants will be hired through a firm selected on a quality (80%) and cost \n(20%) basis in the areas of LGU finance, including debt management; accounting and financial \nmanagement;  human  resource  management,  including  training  design  and  execution; \ndevelopment  financing;  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology. Two consultants (for 12 person-months) will be hired on an individual basis, as the \ndistinct areas of expertise involved may not be available through a single firm. The individual \nconsultants  will  be  the  LGU  finance  adviser  (6  person-months)  and  the  adviser  on  debt \nmanagement (6 person-months). The outputs of the TA will be monitored on the basis of \nprogram indicators and TA-specific output milestones. All the consultants will be national, as \nexpertise needed in the output areas is nationally available. The outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 2. ADB will engage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the simplified technical proposal for the \nrecruitment  of  firms.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.13 Any  equipment  assets  purchased  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime); upon completion of the TA, they will be handed over to BLGF.  \n \n16.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 18 months, commencing around April 2010 \nwith completion expected in October 2011. The outputs of the TA will be monitored on the basis \nof TA-specific output milestones. TA outputs will be disseminated mainly in the form of study \nand policy reports and policy-related seminars and workshops that will be held. The outputs will \nalso be uploaded on the BLGF website. The team leader will assist ADB to provide quality \ncontrol and outcome evaluation. In consultation with the government, the more significant policy \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nreports may be published for dissemination to a wider audience including national and regional \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \npolicy makers, academia, and development partners. \n \n                                                                                                          \n13 ADB. 1998.

BLGF has agreed to identify adequate furnished office accommodation for the TA team, \nincluding telephone and fax lines and internet connection facilities. In total, the TA will employ \nnine national consultants. All consultants will to a significant extent work intermittently and some \nconsultants will spend considerable time in BLGF, DBM, DILG, and MDFO. Accordingly, it was \nagreed  that  office  accommodation  and  furniture  in  BLGF  would  adequately  cater  for  five \npersons while DBM, DILG, and MDFO would provide adequate desk space for consultants \nworking from there from time to time.   \n \nIV.
