INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will continue Asian Development \nBank (ADB) support for the Government of Azerbaijan\u2019s efforts to diversify the economy and \npromote sustainable, non-oil economic growth. It is part of a package of financial and technical \nsupport  for  macroeconomic  and  structural  reforms  that  help  address  key  constraints  to \neconomic diversification through knowledge support, policy advice, and capacity building. The \nTA will assist the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FIMSA), the financial sector regulator \nand supervisor, to develop policies that promote nonbank and alternative financial services to \nimprove financial intermediation and inclusion in the economy, strengthen FIMSA\u2019s capacity to \nregulate and supervise these services, and assist FIMSA in developing and conducting financial \nliteracy and education programs that help improve consumer demand for these services. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the ADB country operations business plan for Azerbaijan, 2018\u2013\n2020.1 It is aligned with the Strategic Road Map on National Economic Perspectives, which was \ninstitutionalized by a presidential decree in 2016 and contains three strategic components: (i) an \neconomic development strategy and action plan for 2016\u20132020, (ii) a long-term vision for 2025, \nand  (iii)  a  post-2025  aspirational  vision.2 The  Strategic  Road  Map  on  National  Economic \nPerspectives sets the direction for 11 strategic road maps, which include facilitating access to \nfinance (strategic road map 11 on financial services development) and agricultural development \n(strategic road map 3 on the production and processing of agricultural products). The TA will \ndirectly contribute to the Strategy 2030 operational priority of strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity and to the economic diversification objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Azerbaijan, 2019\u20132023.3, 4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. The Asian Development Outlook 2018 noted the Azerbaijan \neconomy\u2019s rapid growth during 1995\u20132013, which averaged 11% per year and was driven by \nhigh foreign direct investment in the oil industry, and by growing oil production and exports and \nthe expansionary fiscal policy that these enabled.5 However, oil production started to peak in \nmid-2014. The subsequent decline in oil prices during 2014\u20132016 led to a significant reduction \nin economic growth; oil and gas revenues accounted for about 30% of gross domestic product \n(GDP),  60%  of  budget  revenues,  and more than  90%  of  export  revenues. Two  waves  of \ncurrency devaluation in 2015 raised credit risks and led to deterioration in asset quality, with \nseveral  banks  and  nonbank  credit  institutions  (NBCIs)  subsequently  closing.  After  the \ndevaluation, commercial banks changed their lending policies and pursued more United States \ndollar lending. This led to a drastic decline in local currency deposits and an increase in \ndollarization. As a result, credit to the economy, which was already low by regional standards, \ndeclined by 28.5% in 2017. \n \n4.  Economic diversification. The government recognizes that the finance sector can play \na more transformative role in non-oil productive sectors of the economy, especially for small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  in  the  regions  outside  Baku,  the  capital.  As  a  key \nstrategy to enable this, the government wishes to promote nonbank and alternative financial \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nservices, such as financial leasing, pawn shopping, credit union and cooperatives services, \npostal  financial  services,  and  some  forms  of  uncollateralized  lending.  In  addition,  the \ngovernment wants to see substantially increased lending to sectors such as agriculture, which \nemploys 38% of the workforce but only contributes 7.5% to GDP.6 The biggest constraints to \nagricultural financing are repayment schedules that are not aligned to the harvest cycle, high \ninterest rates, and lack of collateral.7 NBCIs and alternative financial services can help address \nthese challenges, particularly in those geographical areas and sectors that have been largely \nbypassed by the banking system. \n \n5.  Bank and nonbank industry profile. Banks and NBCIs are the primary sources of \nfinancial services for SMEs. However, the finance sector is dominated by banks and traditional \nlending  products,  such  as  retail  banking  services  and  short-term  trade  financing,  that  are \noverwhelmingly focused on Baku and are largely directed toward established medium and large \nenterprises.8  Non-oil productive sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and agriculture, \nare largely credit rationed as a result; in 2016, manufacturing comprised only 8% of total lending \nand agriculture made up 3%. Similarly, although regions outside Baku represent 78% of the \npopulation  and  62%  of  entrepreneurs,  in  2016  they  received  only  17%  of  total  lending. \nNonbanking services are dominated by microfinance institutions, which comprise about half of \nall NBCIs, and two providers, Access Bank and FINCA Azerbaijan, which account for 46% of \nthe market.9 The combined microfinance loan portfolio is only about 1% of GDP. NBCIs, such as \nfinancial  leasing,  pawn  shopping,  credit  union  and  cooperatives  services,  postal  financial \nservices, and some forms of uncollateralized lending, are not well developed but hold significant \npotential. The target market for NBCIs include small farmers, trade and service SMEs, and \nindividual  enterprises,  which  mostly  produce  consumer  goods.  This  situation  is  unlikely  to \nimprove in the short term given that (i) devaluation led to a reduction in the number of NBCIs \nfrom  157  in  2015  to  123  in  2017,  (ii)  there  was  a  subsequent  decline  in  demand  from \nmicrofinance customers from 600,000 in 2015 to 181,400 by June 2018, and (iii) there is \ninadequate financial infrastructure in the regions outside Baku. \n \n6.  Enabling environment. Despite these challenges, the government believes nonbank \nand alternative financial services could become an essential source of local currency financing \nfor SMEs and rural economic activity, provided that (i) appropriate policy, legal, and institutional \nreforms are developed and implemented; and (ii) financial literacy and education programs and \noutreach are improved. Banking policies, laws, and institutions are considered adequate, and \nADB, the International Finance Corporation, and the World Bank provide financing and TA to \nhelp address the lack of capital and improve the enabling environment. However, the same \ncannot be said of the nonbank industry.10 No policies exist for nonbank and alternative financial \n                                                \n6  G. Ibadoghlu. 2018.

Tokyo: Asian Development Bank Institute. \n7  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 2016. Constraints of Agricultural Finance in Azerbaijan. \nLondon. \n8  Of the 30 banks in operation in Azerbaijan, two are state banks, although the government announced the \nprivatization of the International Bank of Azerbaijan in 2018. Azerbaijan has 15 foreign capital banks, including \nlocal branches of foreign banks. The government lifted all restrictions on foreign capital in the finance sector in \n2005, but large foreign banks have yet to penetrate the market. \n9  More than 150 NBCIs operate in Azerbaijan. As of 1 April 1 2018, their aggregate loan portfolio totaled AZN413.9 \nmillion, or about 3.3% of the total portfolio of all credit institutions, according to the Central Bank of Azerbaijan. \n10 ADB policy financing is helping the government (i) enact key finance sector laws such as the Guarantee of \nMortgage Loans Law, 2018; (ii) approve amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Law, 2018; (iii) establish a \nstate register of movable property; and (iv) operationalize the Azerbaijan Credit Bureau. The International Finance \nCorporation is supporting the development of some agent banking regulations. The World Bank is providing TA to \nstrengthen banking laws and regulations, as well as FIMSA\u2019s finance sector stability mandate. \n ", "3 \nservices. Although laws such as the Law on Credit Unions, 2000 and the Law on Non-Bank \nCredit Institutions, 2010 are considered adequate and in line with international standards, the \nregulatory environment is fragmented, compliance with reporting requirements is weak, and not \nall NBCIs are covered.11 In addition, FIMSA is a new institution and its capacity to develop \nappropriate policies and to adequately regulate and supervise NBCIs under its mandate is still \ndeveloping. These developments have constrained financial intermediation and inclusiveness, \nas well as productivity levels in non-oil sectors of the economy. There is considerable scope, \ntherefore, for ADB to help FIMSA address these challenges (paras. 4\u20135) and demonstrate \nstrong value addition. \n \n7.  Enabling environment reforms. The government has addressed some of the most \npressing  weaknesses  in  the  finance  sector  in  response  to  these  challenges.  Major \nachievements include (i) the establishment of FIMSA in 2016 and its mandate under its charter \nto develop, regulate, and supervise the Azerbaijan financial market; (ii) the creation of a credit \nguarantee fund for SMEs; (iii) the establishment of a secured transactions registry; (iv) the \nenactment of legislation to establish the legal framework for setting up a credit bureau; (v) the \nestablishment of the Financial Literacy Council; (vi) the integration of digital financial services \ninto bank operations; and (vii) the enactment of banking law amendments in 2017, including \ncritical  provisions  for  appointing  temporary  administrators  for  distressed  banks.  The  next \nreforms will accelerate efforts to address supply- and demand-side issues. Amendments to the \nLaw on NBCIs and new laws for leasing services, pawnshops, and credit unions have been \nprioritized.  FIMSA  is  well  positioned  to  lead  and  coordinate  these  reforms  given  its  dual \ndevelopment  and  regulatory  mandates.  It  also  leads  government-established  multiagency \nworking groups to improve financial intermediation and inclusion, and it shares the mandate for \nfinancial education and literacy with the Central Bank of Azerbaijan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: availability of finance in local currency in \nnon-oil productive sectors of the economy improved.12 The TA will have the following outcome: \nappropriate nonbank and alternative financial services in local currency improved.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Policy, regulatory, and institutional framework for appropriate nonbank \nand alternative financial services improved. The TA will assess (i) the enabling environment \nfor delivering nonbank and alternative financial services in Azerbaijan manat and (ii) FIMSA\u2019s \ninstitutional and organizational capacity to regulate and supervise these services and draw from \ninternational best practices to recommend areas where reforms are needed. In particular, this \nwork will include (i) assessment of relevant policies, laws, and regulations; (ii) assessment of \nthe mandates, functions, and organizational capacity of FIMSA, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, \nand other development and regulatory entities; (iii) assessment of the financial infrastructure \nand  capacity  to  deploy  more  digitized  services;  and  (iv)  identification  of  international  best \npractices and solutions that could work in the Azerbaijan context. \n                                                \n11 Financial leasing companies and pawnshops, for example, are regulated based on several provisions and articles \nof the Civil Code of Azerbaijan, 1999. \n12 Footnote 2, strategic road map 11 on financial services development. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n \n10.  Output 2: Consumer demand for appropriate nonbank and alternative financial \nservices improved. The TA will assess consumer and creditor protection policy and legislation \nand draw from international best practices to recommend areas where reforms are needed. This \nwork will cover strengthening legislation on creditors\u2019 rights in uncollateralized lending, including \nassessing  relevant  laws  and  regulations  and  their  integration  with  Azerbaijan\u2019s  insolvency \nframework. Under this output, the TA team will develop a financial literacy and education \nprogram  that  will  help  FIMSA  improve  consumer  demand  for  appropriate  nonbank  and \nalternative financial services. \n \n11.  The TA will support the engagement of a firm with international and national experts in \nnonbank  financial  supervision  and  regulation,  pawnshop  regulation,  credit  union  and \ncooperatives services, financial leasing, postal financial services, and rural agricultural financing. \nThe TA will build on long-standing engagement in finance sector development in Azerbaijan that \nbegan in 1996 with the Private Banks and Leasing Companies project.14 In addition, the TA will \nprovide analytical inputs to strengthen the policy content of subprogram 2 of the Improving \nGovernance and Public Sector Efficiency Program earmarked for Board consideration in 2019,15 \nand prepare the scope for the next phase of the programmatic policy-based lending schedule \nfor 2021. Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s engagement include (i) the need to make sure that \nengagement  between  ADB  and  the  government  includes  dialogue  and  coordination  with \nappropriate agencies to provide a stronger framework for competition and doing business, (ii) \nthe importance of close investigation and scrutiny of the implementing agency\u2019s commitment \nand capacity to implement the TA, and (iii) the need to promote interagency coordination. These \nlessons have been incorporated into the design of the TA. For example, FIMSA is coordinating \nand  collaborating  with  other  relevant  government  agencies  through  working  group \narrangements  to  gain  adequate  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  TA  effectively  and \nefficiently (para. 7). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. FIMSA will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, \noffice space, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  The  TA  will  also  explore  opportunities  to  improve  development  partner \ncoordination through cofinancing and joint analytical work. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA through its Central and West Asia Department\u2019s Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division, which will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants, organize discussions, and provide staff to act as resource persons as required. \nADB\u2019s Azerbaijan Resident Mission will assign staff to join the TA implementation team. To \nfacilitate the One ADB approach, TA implementation will be coordinated with the Private Sector \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2011.
