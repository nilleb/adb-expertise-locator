The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) was established in July 1999 \nat the initiative of the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom, working closely with the \nWorld Bank. This multidonor technical assistance (TA) facility was set up to assist developing \ncountries to improve the quality of their infrastructure through private sector involvement. PPIAF \nassistance helps  to  facilitate  private  sector  involvement  in  financing,  ownership,  operation, \nrehabilitation,  maintenance  or  management  of  infrastructure  services.  Eligible  infrastructure \nservices  assisted  by  PPIAF  are  roads,  ports,  airports,  railways,  electricity  supply, \ntelecommunications,  solid  waste,  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) joined PPIAF in 2001 by contributing an initial \n$250,000 to the trust fund to cover the 12 months from 1 January 2001.1 Thereafter, ADB \nrenewed its funding support for 5 years to the end of 2006.2 The present TA for $500,000 \nrepresents a fourth cash contribution to the PPIAF trust fund, covering membership for 2 years \nfrom 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008. As a partner in the facility, ADB strengthens its role \nin mobilizing private resources for infrastructure development in the Asia and Pacific region.3 \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Mission and Organization. PPIAF\u2019s mission is to help to eliminate poverty and achieve \nsustainable development in developing countries by facilitating private sector involvement in \ninfrastructure. PPIAF pursues its mission through two mechanisms: (i) technical assistance to \ngovernments in developing countries on strategies and measures to tap the full potential of \nprivate involvement in infrastructure, and (ii) identification, dissemination and promotion of good \npractices on matters related to private involvement in infrastructure in developing countries. \n \n4.  As a member, ADB is represented on the PPIAF Program Council (PC), which includes \nrepresentatives of all contributing donor agencies. As of June 2006, there were 15 members \nincluding ADB. The Program Management Unit (PMU) manages the day-to-day operations of \nPPIAF in accordance with a general strategy and annual work programs approved by the PC. \nThe  PC  meets  once  a  year  to  review  the  strategic  direction  of  the  PPIAF  program, \nachievements  and  financing  requirements.  The  World  Bank  acts  as  the  PPIAF  trust  fund \nadministrator. PPIAF has established four field-based regional coordination offices to assist in \nexecuting the PPIAF work program in Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Manila, Philippines; and \nNew Delhi, India. An independent Technical Advisory Panel, comprising leading international \nexperts in different aspects of private provision of infrastructure, supports the PC. \n \n5.  Resources and Projects Approved. As of 30 June 2006, donors have contributed a \ntotal of $122 million to PPIAF, including more than $2.1 million of net investment income. \nInformation on donor contributions in core funds and noncore funds is in Table 1.  The noncore \nfunds focus on the donors\u2019 agenda in either a particular country or a particular activity. The core \nfunds can be used for general PPIAF activities. The World Bank and the governments of Japan \nand the United Kingdom have accounted for the bulk of resources to support PPIAF programs.  \n                                                 \n1   PPIAF follows the financial year of the World Bank Group, which runs from 1 July to 30 June. \n2  ADB. 2002.

From its inception to 30 June 2006, PPIAF approved 505 grants amounting to more than \n$111 million. As of 30 June 2006, the PPIAF portfolio included activities in 108 countries as well \nas 90 regional activities. In addition, PPIAF mobilized additional cofinancing of $8.4 million from \nother donors and through contributions from governments. A review of PPIAF-funded activities \nat the end of 20064 showed the following outcomes: (i) 83 infrastructure investment transactions \nwere facilitated; (ii) 43 public-private partnership (PPP) laws and regulations were drafted, of \nwhich 29 were enacted; (iii) 40 regulatory institutions were established or strengthened; (iv) \nimplementation  of  sector  reform  programs  was  supported;  and  (v)  best  practices  were \ndisseminated to more than 15,000 people through attendance at international and regional \nconferences and workshops. \n \n7.  PPIAF\u2019s FY2006 Program. Fiscal 2006 saw continued demand for PPIAF assistance as \nthe experience with private participation reinforced the critical importance of sector reform, \nenabling environments and government capacity to ensure effective results from PPPs. In \nresponse, PPIAF approved funding for 93 activities for a total of $17.4 million in TA grants, \nmaintaining its performance levels from the previous fiscal year. Significant elements of the \nwork  program  reflected  three  major  trends,  as  follows:  (i)  PPP  arrangements  reflect  great \ndiversity  ranging  from  concessions  to  nonequity  models  such  as  leases  and  management \ncontracts, (ii) reform efforts are increasingly taking into account the need for building consensus \nand recognizing transition costs, and (iii) reinforcement of the basics of sector reform and \nproject preparation is critical in realizing the full benefits of PPPs.  \n \n                                                 \n4   PPIAF. 2006. Annual Report. World Bank.  \n ", "  3\n8.  Emerging  Best  Practice.  The  objective  of  disseminating  knowledge  and  the  main \nlessons emerging in the private infrastructure market in recent years drives PPIAF\u2019s knowledge \nmanagement portfolio. Resources are directed to (i) providing ongoing support to activities \naimed  at  improving  regulatory  systems  for  infrastructure  provision,  and  (ii)  analyzing  the \nincreased activity by \u201cnontypical\u201d private investors and operators, to highlight the wider array of \ninvestment  options  made  apparent  by  this  emerging  trend.  To  strengthen  outreach  and \ndissemination, PPIAF launched Gridlines in 2006, a series of four-page notes that provide \nexamples of best practice on emerging and important themes in the environment for PPPs.  \n \n9.  Rationale for Continued ADB Membership in PPIAF. The infrastructure demands of \nthe Asia-Pacific region are immense and the public sector alone cannot bridge the financing and \nefficiency gaps. Development of private sector involvement in infrastructure is crucial to the \nsustained economic growth of the region. Continued membership of PPIAF allows ADB to \naccess an existing partnership of all major donors that will enhance the knowledge content of \nongoing and proposed private sector participation (PSP) projects. An active partnership with \nPPIAF provides a significant opportunity to keep abreast of major initiatives in the private \ninfrastructure sector. \n \n10.  There is strong demand for PSP support among ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs). Demand is indicated by PPIAF\u2019s 160 TA projects valued at $37.2 million,5 which \nrepresent about 34% of all PPIAF activities. PPIAF\u2019s activities play an important role in assisting \nDMCs to meet their needs. Through continued membership, ADB can further enhance its role in \npromoting private sector development of infrastructure in the region, allowing it to leverage its \nresources to carry out critical studies on private sector and infrastructure development, and to \nprovide staff with continued access to valuable global knowledge. ADB acts as a donor to \nPPIAF and also as an important user of the facility\u2019s resources. Since it joined PPIAF, ADB has \nmade use of $2.2 million of PPIAF funding support for 10 TA projects to promote private \ninfrastructure. (The ratio between ADB\u2019s contribution and PPIAF funding is about 2:1.)  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  In pursuit of ADB\u2019s overarching objective to reduce poverty in DMCs through sustainable \neconomic  development,  the  TA  aims  to  support  PPIAF  in  facilitating  greater  PSP  in \ninfrastructure in accordance with ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy and the broad \ndirections under ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II. The TA will allow ADB to continue to be an \nactive member of PPIAF, to build on its partnership with other major donors in this area, and to \nassist DMCs in resource mobilization. It will also help ADB achieve knowledge sharing through \naccess to studies on PSP in infrastructure projects conducted under PPIAF. As an active \nmember of the PC, ADB also reviews all private infrastructure TA projects funded through \nPPIAF (which are largely from the World Bank), provides comments, and prevents duplication \nby other donors. (The TA framework is in Appendix 1.) \n \n                                                 \n5   South Asia, 59 projects for $12.6 million; East Asia and the Pacific, 89 projects for $20 million; Eastern Europe and \nCentral Asia (ADB DMCs only), 12 projects for $4.6 million. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Funding support from this TA will enable ADB to continue its important partnership with \nPPIAF. ADB\u2019s continued membership will provide additional benefits to ADB\u2019s DMCs as well as \nadditional resources for focusing on promoting private infrastructure sector development in \nDMCs.  Overall,  the  TA  supports  a  range  of  advisory  and  related  activities,  including  the \nfollowing. \n \n(i)  Framing  infrastructure  development  strategies  to  take  full  advantage  of  the \npotential for private involvement. \n \n(ii)  Building consensus on appropriate policy, regulatory and institutional reforms. \n \n(iii)  Designing and implementing specific policy, regulatory and institutional reforms. \n \n(iv)  Supporting  the  design  and  implementation  of  pioneering  projects  and \ntransactions. \n \n(v)  Building  government  capacity  to  design  and  execute  private  infrastructure \narrangements and regulate private service providers. \n \n13.  The TA will provide membership contribution to PPIAF\u2019s core funds. It will thus help \nmeet the cost of consulting services recruited by ADB as well as other eligible expenses for \nundertaking ADB-initiated PPIAF projects designed to encourage PSP in infrastructure and \ncreate an enabling environment for PPPs. Through its membership in the PC, ADB will also play \nan important role in selecting PPIAF project activities. In most cases, these projects will further \nthe poverty reduction objectives of ADB and generally complement the studies proposed by \nADB in its private sector development strategy. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  ADB will contribute $500,000 to PPIAF, which will be used to finance consulting services \nand other costs.6 The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nDisbursements  against  the  trust  fund  account  will  have  the  prior  approval  of  the  ADB-\ndesignated task manager. The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2007 to 31 October 2009, \nthe latest agreed utilization closing date. ADB\u2019s contribution will be provided after the successful \ndiscussion and signing of the letter of agreement between the trust fund administrator (the \nWorld Bank) and ADB for the period covered. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The implementation arrangements for ADB\u2019s involvement in PPIAF are set forth in and \ngoverned by the PPIAF trust fund agreement and the guidelines signed by PPIAF and ADB on \n29 June 2005, as amended by the amendment letter signed on 5 October 2006 (see Appendix \n2). Under the amended agreement, overall project management of ADB-initiated PPIAF projects \nis delegated to ADB. As such, procurement of goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n                                                 \n6  Eligible categories of expenditures include associated overheads; short-term consultant fees; contractual services; \ntravel, media and workshop costs (para. 15, Annex 4, Amended Trust Fund Agreement dated 5 October 2006). \n(Amended Trust Fund Agreement available as a Supplementary Appendix which can be obtained on request.) \n ", "  5\non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. Administration of the TA is expected to be coordinated with \nthe Energy, Transport and Water Division (RSID) of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment,  which  will  assist  the  regional  departments  and  facilitate  the  preparation  of \napplications  for  PPIAF  grants  that  support  promotion  of  private  sector  investment  in \ninfrastructure. RSID will coordinate ADB-initiated PPIAF projects, act as an intermediary with \nPMU, and also work with PMU to monitor closely all ongoing ADB-initiated PPIAF projects. \nOnce individual projects are approved, responsibility for implementation will lie with the division \nthat initiates the PPIAF proposal. \n \n17.  Governance and Organization Structure. PPIAF is governed by the PC, consisting of \nrepresentatives from contributing donors. The PC is responsible for defining PPIAF policies and \nstrategies, approving the indicative annual work program and financial plan, and reviewing PPIA \nperformance. The PC also is responsible for approving individual project submissions. The PC \nmeets once a year to review the strategic direction of the PPIAF program. The Technical \nAdvisory  Panel,  composed  of  up  to  six  independent  experts  in  matters  related  to  private \ninvolvement in infrastructure in developing countries, ensures the quality and relevance of \nPPIAF-financed activities. PMU is responsible for the day-to-day management of PPIAF in \npursuit of its mandate. PMU reports to the PC at least quarterly through the PC chair. The World \nBank\u2019s Vice-President for Sustainable Development chairs the PC. The details are in Appendix \n2. \n \n18.  Financial Arrangements. PPIAF has a two-tier financial structure comprising a core \nfund and noncore funds. The core fund contains a pool of resources that can be used for any \nactivity falling within the work program approved by the PC. The funds may be applied to \ngovernance costs, country-specific activities and activities across several countries. Noncore \nfunds include donor agency restrictions relating to specific themes or activities. ADB will enter \ninto an agreement for its contributions to PPIAF with the World Bank. \n \n19.  Past Performance. Since its membership in PPIAF, ADB has made a total contribution \nof $1.25 million and was granted a total of $2.2 million for 10 ADB-initiated PPIAF projects. \nADB-initiated PPIAF projects are listed in Appendix 3. ADB has not only participated in an \nimportant  global  initiative  supporting  infrastructure  development,  but  it  also  has  leveraged \nresources to support its program in this area. \n \n20.  Results from the independent strategic review of PPIAF operations in the past 5 years \n(1999\u20132004) validated the relevance of the facility\u2019s core mandate of supporting infrastructure \nservices  through  PPPs.  With  strong  donor  support,  PPIAF  is  a  good  example  of  global \npartnership working to catalyze private sector investments in infrastructure. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \n     \nImproved quality and  Increased number of  Annual reports of Public-\nquantity of  DMC infrastructure  Private Infrastructure \ninfrastructure in  development  Advisory Facility (PPIAF) \ndeveloping member  strategies   \ncountries (DMCs)    World Bank private \nthrough private sector  Improved consensus  participation in \ninvolvement  for policy, regulatory  infrastructure database \nand institutional   \nreforms within DMCs   \n  Specific technical \nIncreased number of  assistance (TA) project \npioneering projects  completion reports \nand transactions \ninvolving the private \nsector \n \nImproved capacity of \nDMC governments to \ndesign and execute \nprivate infrastructure \nprojects and regulate \nthe private sector \n \nOutcomes      Assumption \n       \nAssist governments to  TAs initiated by the  Project progress reports  Written commitment of \nmobilize additional  Asian Development    government departments is \nresources to initiate  Bank (ADB), enabling    required to ensure \nstudies on private  PSP in infrastructure    commitment to carry out a \nsector participation  projects and    specific study\u2019s \n(PSP) in infrastructure  promoting private    recommendations \n  sector involvement     \n      Risks \n  Dissemination of  Project completion   \n  studies through sector  reports  Other government agencies \n  network mechanisms    may hinder implementation \n  and other electronic    of a study\u2019s \n  forums    recommendations \n     \nProvide ADB access    Insufficient internal interest \nto PSP studies  PPIAF quarterly review \nconducted under  reports \nPPIAF   \nInterdepartmental \ncoordination meetings, \nseminars, and websites \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Risk \n       \nSpecific TA projects to  Complete studies and  ADB to develop a  The approval process is \nsupport promotion of  implement  tracking mechanism to  delayed \nprivate sector  recommendations  monitor ADB proposals   \ninvestment in  submitted for PPIAF \ninfrastructure  funding \n \n \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \nRemittance of PPIAF membership fee for 2007 by October 2007, and for  ADB contribution to PPIAF \n2008 by June 2008  trust fund \n   \nReview and approval of proposals submitted for PPIAF funding  $500,000 \n   \nFormulation of infrastructure development strategies for expanding private  Staff inputs \nsector investment in infrastructure   \nConsulting services \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8    Appendix 2 \nGOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE \nINFRASTRUCTURE ADVISORY FACILITY \n \nA.  Program Council \n \n1.  The Program Council (PC) includes all agencies contributing to PPIAF. It is responsible \nfor (i) defining the policies and strategies of the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility \n(PPIAF), (ii) approving the indicative annual work program and financial plan, and (iii) reviewing \nPPIAF performance. The PC generally meets once a year, but it approves PPIAF proposals \nthroughout the year on a \u201cno-objection\u201d basis. As a member of the PC, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has authority to approve or object to each PPIAF proposal. PPIAF has established \nfour  field-based  regional  coordination  offices  in  New  Delhi,  India;  Nairobi,  Kenya;  Manila, \nPhilippines; and Dakar, Senegal.  \n \nB.  Program Management Unit  \n \n2.  The Program Management Unit (PMU) is responsible for PPIAF\u2019s day-to-day operations. \nPMU reports to the PC at least quarterly through the PC chair. PMU\u2019s staff members are \nrecruited internationally for their relevant expertise. The unit\u2019s main responsibilities include (i) \nreviewing  proposals  for  PPIAF  assistance;  (ii)  recommending  approval  to  the  PC;  (iii) \nmaintaining effective relationships with contributors, recipient governments, the private sector \nand  stakeholders;  (iv)  proposing  and  administering  the  PPIAF  work  plan  and  budget;  (v) \nmanaging the disbursement of funds; and (vi) overseeing the operations of regional coordination \noffices. The regional coordination offices assist PMU to execute the PPIAF work program in \ntheir respective jurisdictions. \n \nC.  Technical Advisory Panel  \n \n3.  The Technical Advisory Panel comprises up to six independent specialists with expertise \nin matters related to private involvement in infrastructure in developing countries, and ensures \nthe quality and relevance of PPIAF-funded activities.  \n \nD.  PPIAF Governing Structure \n \n4.  PPIAF is a partnership technical assistance facility that is governed by the PC. Each \nagency contributing to PPIAF has an equal seat on the PC, regardless of that agency\u2019s level of \ncontribution. This means all contributors receive the same information about PPIAF activities, \nfunds management and impacts. All contributors on the PC receive every application valued at \nmore than $75,000, along with a summary describing the proposed activity, and may approve or \nreject the project. All applications below $75,000 go to PMU for approval. An application is \nrejected if any one contributor rejects it. These rights and responsibilities are set out in PPIAF\u2019s \nCharter (see http://www.ppiaf.org). \n \n5.  PMU is tasked with day-to-day management of PPIAF, monitoring funds and activities, \ncoordinating  the  PC  and  the  Technical  Advisory  Panel,  and  preparing  the  summary  and \npresentation of applications for approval. A program manager was hired by the PC, which \nconducted interviews and ranked candidates in joint session. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nE.  Eligibility for PPIAF Products \n \n6.  Countries eligible to receive PPIAF assistance are those in the list of aid recipients of the \nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Development Assistance \nCommittee. However, as required by PPIAF trust fund documents, only member countries of \nADB  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  are  eligible  to  receive  assistance  from  the  ADB  technical \nassistance (TA) grant. Project activities submitted for approval must (i) be consistent with the \nPPIAF mission; (ii) have government commitment; (iii) provide an additional flow of resources; \n(iv)  have  quality  assurances;  and  (v)  meet  regional,  sectoral,  environmental  and  social \nresponsibilities. \n \nF.   Criteria for Approval of Activities \n \n7.  As stated in PPIAF\u2019s Charter (Article 17), activities must meet strict criteria before they \ncan  be  approved.  The  criteria  include  demonstrated  commitment  from  the  beneficiary \ngovernment in the case of country-specific activities, and proof of aid coordination. Specifically, \nthe activity must \u201cnot conflict with programs of activities being undertaken\u201d by any of PPIAF\u2019s \ncontributors.  Article  17  also  restricts  PPIAF  funding  to  those  activities  that  require  a  \u201cnet \nadditional flow of resources,\u201d meaning that PPIAF does not fund projects that could receive \nfunding from another source. For example, if an application involves the preparation of a project \nthat will eventually be funded from loans from the World Bank or ADB, PPIAF will not accept the \napplication. It would be assumed that the project preparation budget should be available from \nthe lending institution. To be clear, this means PPIAF does not contribute grant funds to World \nBank projects, and would not do so for any other aid agency. A main reason for PMU rejection \nof an application is due diligence showing the availability of other more suitable sources of \nfunding, including credit lines from aid agencies.  \n \n8.  Proposals for PPIAF assistance that meet the threshold eligibility requirements of the \nTechnical Advisory Panel shall be assessed against the following criteria. \n \n(i)  Consistency  with  PPIAF  mission.  All  activities  must  be  consistent  with \nPPIAF\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  helping  to  eliminate  poverty  and  achieve \nsustainable development. \n \n(ii)  Government  commitment. Country-specific activities may be undertaken \nonly where there is clear evidence of government commitment to the activity. \nThe government in question must approve of the proposed activity in writing.1 \n \n(iii)  Donor  coordination.  PPIAF  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  a  way  that \npromotes effective coordination with the activities of official donors. In particular, \ncountry-specific activities may be undertaken only if PMU is satisfied that the \nproposed activity does not conflict with programs or activities being undertaken \nby the World Bank Group, other PPIAF contributors or, to the extent this is easily \nverifiable, by other donors. \n \n(iv)  Additional resources. PPIAF is intended to result in a net additional flow of \nresources to relevant activities. Accordingly, funding for a proposed activity \n                                                 \n1   Activities involving multiple countries will not be required normally to meet this criterion. However, the criterion \nmay be applied to activities across countries that are designed to benefit directly a small number of easily \nidentifiable countries. \n ", "10   Appendix 2 \nshould not be available more conveniently from other sources, including loans \nfrom  international  financial  institutions,  grants  from  other  programs  or  a \ngovernment\u2019s own resources. \n \n(v)  Cofinancing.  PPIAF is able to pay up to 100% of the costs of an activity. \nHowever,  cofinancing  from  a  recipient  government  and  other  sources  is \nencouraged. \n \n(vi)  Value  for  money.  PPIAF  activities  should aim  to  ensure  value  for  money, \nincluding  adopting  the  lowest  cost  strategies  consistent  with  appropriate \nstandards of quality. \n \n(vii)  Quality  assurance. Applications for PPIAF funding should contain indicators \nagainst which activity quality can be assessed. Larger activities should usually \ninclude appropriate consultative and quality review mechanisms. \n \n(viii)  Regional and sectoral balance. Subject to the work program approved by the \nPC, activities financed from the core fund should aim to maintain a reasonable \nbalance across developing regions and across eligible infrastructure sectors. \n \n(ix)  Environmental and social responsibility. Where a project to be supported by \nPPIAF is anticipated to have significant potential adverse environmental or social \nconsequences, appropriate measures must be adopted to ensure an objective \nand  transparent  assessment.  When  required,  PPIAF  can  finance  such \nassessments. \n \n(x)  Expenditures.  Eligible  expenditures  for  PPIAF  activities  may  include  the \nfollowing. \n \n(a)  Costs associated with identifying, supervising and delivering the activity. \n(b)  Costs associated with preparing and disseminating information produced \nby PPIAF. \n(c)  Costs associated with organizing workshops, seminars or conferences, \nincluding costs related to participation by relevant international experts \nand, in appropriate cases, representatives of recipient governments. \n(d)  Costs of visit programs for appropriate developing country personnel. \n(e)  Other expenditures related directly to the fulfillment of PPIAF\u2019s mandate. \n \nG.  Administrative and Procurement Procedures for ADB-Initiated PPIAF TA Projects \n \n9.  All members of PPIAF sign a trust agreement with the World Bank, the depository of all \nPPIAF funds. Trust fund agreements for the first three ADB contributions were completed in \n2001, 2003 and 2005. On 12 March 2003, ADB and the World Bank signed the \u201cNotes on \nadministrative and procurement procedures for PPIAF-approved activities co-tasked managed \nby the ADB and the World Bank.\u201d This document provided guidelines for implementing ADB-\ninitiated PPIAF projects. However, the implementation procedures proved to be complicated \nand  inefficient  due  to  differing  processes,  causing  delays  in  project  implementation.  To \nstreamline procedures, an amendment to the trust fund agreement for the third ADB contribution \nwas signed by ADB and the World Bank on 5 October 2006. Under the amended agreement, \nproject management of ADB-initiated PPIAF projects will be delegated to ADB and procurement \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nof  goods  and  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nH.  Reporting and Audit Requirements \n \n10.  PC  members  receive  a  quarterly  financial  statement  (unaudited)  and  a  quarterly \nprogress report on the status of approved activities. They also receive an annual report on all \nPPIAF activities and summary financial statements, no later than 6 months after the end of \nPPIAF\u2019s fiscal year. The World Bank, as trust fund administrator, will provide members an \nannual  management  statement,  together  with  attestation  from  the  external  auditor  of  the \nsatisfactory performance of the procedures and controls used in administering PPIAF funds. \nExternal reviews and financial audits of PPIAF activities may be performed at the request of the \nPC and contributors with respect to their contributions. ADB will request an annual review and \nfinancial audit of its contributions, and expenditures incurred. \n ", "12  Appendix 2     \n  ADB TA PROJECTS   \n(as of 31 December 2006) \n     \nStatus  Title  Amount \n($\u2019000) \n   \nCompleted  1.
