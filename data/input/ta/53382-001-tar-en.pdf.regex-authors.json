Road transport in Bangladesh. Road is the dominant transport mode in Bangladesh, \nwith a modal share of over 70% of passenger traffic and 60% of freight traffic.1 Road traffic has \nbeen growing at an average rate of over 6.6% per year between 2016 and 2020.2 The number of \nvehicles has also increased by 15% annually since 2015, reaching 4.4 million in 2020.3 The key \nchallenges for Bangladesh\u2019s roads are limited capacity, deteriorating conditions, missing links \nacross the country\u2019s many rivers, and the mixture of traffic of differing speeds.4 \n \n2.  Dhaka\u2013Sylhet  corridor.  Upgrading  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Sylhet  corridor\u2014the  main  part  of \nNational Highway No. 2 (N2) and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) \nRoad Corridor No. 5\u2014has been the government\u2019s top priority for completing the country\u2019s \nmultimodal transport system.5 Once completed, the corridor will open up a new trade route \nconnecting Chattogram via Dhaka and Sylhet to the border with the northeastern states of India \nthrough the land ports of Akhaura, Sheola, and Tamabil, and thereby to Bhutan and Myanmar. It \nwill also improve the connectivity of SASEC Corridor No. 2, passing from Kolkata in India through \nBenapole, and Corridor No. 5 that connects Dhaka to Sylhet. This will decongest the Dhaka\u2013\nChattogram corridor on National Highway No. 1 by allowing more goods, especially raw materials, \nto be imported via Tamabil and transported along the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor. \n \n3.  However, the Dhaka\u2012Sylhet road has only two lanes with no provision for slow-moving \nand light traffic, leading to capacity constraints and significant safety risks. This has prevented \nthe Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor from meeting the need for a vital subregional trade corridor and \nproviding inclusive mobility to the poor and vulnerable living along the corridor. The situation is \nfurther  exacerbated  by  climate  change,  which  increases  flooding  risks,  particularly  in  the \nnortheastern wetland districts where low-lying areas remain submerged for 4\u20136 months during \npre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. \n \n3.  The proposed SASEC Dhaka\u2013Sylhet Corridor Road Investment Project will finance the \nimprovement of about 210 kilometers (km) of the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet section of the N2 from a two-lane \nroad to a four-lane road with slow-moving vehicular traffic service lanes, and with design features \nthat take into account the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the differently abled, and \ndisaster and climate risks.6 By connecting to the borders with India via the Sylhet\u2013Tamabil section, \nthe project road will improve efficiency, connectivity, and safety of the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet trade corridor. \n \n4.  The investment project is aligned with the following impact: an efficient, sustainable, safe, \nand regionally balanced transportation system developed.7 The investment project will have the \nfollowing outcome: mobility, safety, and regional trade along the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor improved. \nThis will be delivered through the following outputs: (i) the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor road upgraded \nwith enhanced road safety; elderly, women, children, and differently abled-responsive; and \nclimate- and disaster-resilient features; and (ii) institutional capacity of the Roads and Highways \nDepartment (RHD) enhanced. \n \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2015.

The investment project is estimated to cost $2,691.0 million, including taxes and duties, \nland acquisition and resettlement costs, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges during implementation. The government has requested a multitranche financing facility \nin  an  amount  of  up  to  $1,780.0  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help finance part of the investment project. The investment project \nis included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2021\u22122023.8 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n6.  Road  safety.  The  World  Health  Organization  estimates  road  traffic  fatalities  in \nBangladesh total almost 25,000 annually, while the figure reported by the government is about \n2,000.9 The significant discrepancies between official statistics and independent estimates point \nto possible underreporting, attributable to deficiencies in data collection, management, and \nutilization. This could constrain the RHD and other road safety agencies as they seek to formulate \neffective road safety actions. Accidents are increasing in severity, with a high proportion of road \nfatalities involving collisions between heavy and/or high-speed vehicles such as buses and trucks \nand pedestrians.10 The annual national economic loss related to road casualties is estimated to \nbe about $715.0 million, or nearly 2% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \n \n7.  Limited capacity of the Roads and Highways Department. The RHD\u2019s capacity for \ncollecting, managing, and analyzing accident data is limited. It lacks the capacity to collect \naccident data, and instead relies on the Bangladesh Police for data collection, but which has \nprovided no official accident data since 2015. The Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package 5 \ndatabase, the current accident report and management format used by the RHD and other \nagencies responsible for road safety, including the Bangladeshi Police and Accident Research \nInstitute at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, is obsolete, and the lack \nof access to data is causing inconvenience. The RHD lacks an institutional mechanism to analyze \nand use accident data for road network development, and road safety audit guidelines have not \nbeen incorporated effectively in planning and design. These limitations can prevent the RHD from \nfulfilling  its  mandate  of  planning  and  implementing  infrastructure  solutions  for  road  safety, \nespecially to prevent fatal and severe accidents. \n \n8.  Challenges in operation and maintenance. Globally, Bangladesh ranks 100th out of \n141 countries in terms of the quality of its overall transport infrastructure, and 108th in the quality \nof its roads,11 lagging behind neighboring countries in the region.12 The suboptimal quality of its \nroad network is affecting the country\u2019s logistics performance. Bangladesh ranks 100th out of 160 \ncountries in the Logistics Performance Index, with an infrastructure indicator of 2.39 below the \ncountry\u2019s overall average score of 2.58.13 Logistics service providers overwhelmingly point to \ninadequate road conditions and congestion as main reasons for delays in shipment in the \ncountry.14 \n \n \n8  ADB. 2020.

Remaining challenges to sustainability. The RHD is aiming to maintain a good-to-fair \nassessment for 95% of its total road network. It has implemented various reforms to reach this \ngoal: (i) introducing an annual road condition and service-level assessment process for projecting \n5-year investment needs, (ii) establishing the Road and Bridge Asset Management System \n(2004\u20122005),  (iii)  piloting  performance-based  maintenance, 15 and  increasing  maintenance \nspending on national highways. While these actions have resulted in steady improvement in the \ncondition of its road network, the RHD needs further efforts to improve its maintenance framework \nand ensure sustainability of its expanding road network. The maintenance budget framework must \nbe reformed to adequately reflect assessed road conditions in the maintenance budget proposals. \nThe outdated road asset database and limited field validation of assessed needs, with consequent \nlow reliability of information on road conditions, also need to be improved. Strategies for long-\nterm sustainability must also be in place. The Road Maintenance Fund Board Act, enacted in \n2013, has to be made functional with assured funding and arrangements for transferring proceeds \nof the fund to maintenance operations. The RHD\u2019s capacity for enforcing the Motor Vehicle Axle \nLoad Control Regulations enacted in 2012 also needs to be strengthened.16 \n \n10.  Gender  equality  and  social  inclusion.  Women\u2019s  mobility  needs  have  risen  in \nBangladesh as more women have entered the workforce at pace with the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth. However, the road sector has faced constraints in responding to women\u2019s needs, which \ndiffer from those of men. In particular, the poor condition of roads and lack of features for gender \nequality and social inclusion (GESI) in the current road design make it unsafe to travel for \nvulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and the differently-abled. To address \nthese issues, strengthening of the RHD\u2019s GESI institutional capacity is essential. \n \n11.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the RHD address the key challenges \nfor the road subsector through the following outputs: (i) improving the RHD\u2019s capacity in collection \nand management of road accident data, (ii) enhancing its capacity in road safety audit and \nformulation of a road safety road map, (iii) strengthening its capacity in planning and implementing \nroad maintenance, and (iv) improving its institutional capacity on GESI. The transaction TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2021\u22122023 (footnote 8). \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n12.
