The  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim  Mindanao  (ARMM)  is  midway  into  its  fourth \nadministration  since  being  created  by  Republic  Act  (RA)  6734  in  1989.  The  current \nadministration recently released the Regional Executive Agenda for Peace and Development, \nbased  on  fundamental  political,  economic,  and  institutional  reforms.  Subsequently,  the \nGovernment of the Philippines requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance during the \n2002  Country  Programming  Mission  for  supporting  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nregional capability building and governance in the ARMM. A fact-finding mission was fielded in \nSeptember 2002 and reached broad understanding with the Government on the goal, purpose, \nscope, implementing arrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, and terms of reference for \nthe TA. The TA framework is attached as Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The ARMM continues to be plagued by a high incidence of poverty, underdevelopment, \nand inefficient and ineffective service delivery to constituents. The five provinces of the ARMM \nwere among the six lowest ranking provinces in the country in terms of the human development \nindex, measured in 1997.2 The incidence of poverty in ARMM was 68.6% in 2000, compared to \n42.2% for the rest of Mindanao and 34.2% for the country as a whole. The ARMM performs \nworse on component measures such as literacy rate, infant mortality, maternal mortality and \naccess to safe water. The ARMM has underdeveloped infrastructure, with only 50% of villages \nhaving access to electricity and only 62% with access to potable water. The ability of the region \nto generate investment has been falling since 1997, as has agricultural production, which is the \nmainstay  of  the  rural  economy.  Continued  security  concerns  arising  from  the  activities  of \nterrorist groups and unpredictable peace negations between Government and the Moro-Islamic \nLiberation Front have further dampened investment and trade. \n \n3.  Although the ARMM remains an integral part of the Philippines, and the President \nexercises supervision over the regional governor, RA 6734 (1989), as amended by RA 9054 \n(2000), provides the basis for autonomy and governance in the region giving wide-ranging \npowers and functions to the ARMM regional government. These include its own executive, \nlegislative, and judicial powers to impose and collect certain taxes and to exercise powers for \nthe proper governance and development of the ARMM. In line with this, the ARMM government \nenacted a regional local government code (1993) to further define and enhance autonomy and \ngovernance within the region, particularly by local government units. Neither of these founding \nlaws is well understood by LGU officials or citizens, nor fully implemented. For example, service \ndelivery responsibilities have not been fully devolved and powers and functions remain vested in \nthe regional government. The local government code has not been updated to reflect RA 9054, \nnor is it widely implemented, with most LGUs still using the national Local Government Code of \n1991.  One  reason  cited  for  the  incomplete  implementation  of  the  legal  framework  is  the \ninexperience of officials in both the regional government and the Regional Legislative Assembly \n(RLA) in translating the framework into policies and enabling regional legislation. The ARMM \nregional  government  is  constrained  in  implementing  its  mandates  under  these  laws  by \ninsufficient financial resources, weak institutions and processes, and limited human resource \ncapacity.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 August 2002. \n2 Presentation on the Regional Executive Agenda, by Executive Secretary Nabil Tan, at the Donor Forum on \nCapacity Building for ARMM 31 July 2002. Statistics are drawn from the National Statistics Office. ", "2 \n4.  The regional government currently allocates 86% of its budget to cover personnel costs, \nsqueezing out much needed development expenditures. However, this expenditure does not \ntranslate into service delivery owing to inefficiencies in systems and procedures for human \nresource management, insufficient focus on performance, and a tendency for appointments to \nbe politically influenced. In addition, the functions, responsibilities, and capacity building needs \nof staff should be determined against a revised organizational structure, based on the mandated \nresponsibilities of the regional government under law. The regional agencies have limited skills \nand experience in project identification, planning, project implementation, and monitoring and \nevaluation, which also limits their ability to absorb overseas development assistance (ODA). \nLinkages between regional agencies and local government units and with national agency \ncounterparts are weak, hindering efficient service delivery and coordination on policies and \nprograms. Consequently the regional executive agenda emphasizes the need to professionalize \nthe regional bureaucracy, introduce a more performance-oriented public administration, and \nenhance capacity to enable true autonomy and more efficient service delivery. \n \n5.  The  regional  government  receives  approximately  97%  of  its  budget  as  national \ngovernment transfers, despite the generous provisions under RA 9054 for revenue sharing. \nThese provisions include the retention of 70% of internal revenue taxes generated in the region, \nplus an additional proportion of the national Government share of taxes on natural resources \nand increases in value added tax collections. The regional government enacted its own local \nrevenue code to operationalize these powers, but it is not fully implemented. Most LGUs fall into \nthe lowest two income classes and depend on national government transfers for 90-95% of their \nrevenues. A primary source of local government revenue is the real property tax, but a thorough \nassessment of this has not been carried out for the past 8 years. The ability of local government \nto generate other sources of income, and to attract investment, is limited by security concerns, \nlow economic development, and weak institutional systems and processes. In addition, low \nawareness and compliance with tax laws limits collections.  \n \n6.  The regional executive agenda has peace and confidence building at its core, and \nidentifies clear strategic directions and policy priorities for the regional government. These \ninclude (i) the delivery of basic services, notably education, health, and nutrition and social \nprotection; (ii) livelihood projects for marginalized communities; (iii) modernization of agriculture \nand  fisheries;  (iv)  the  provision  of  strategic  infrastructure;  (v)  the  restructuring  and \nreorganization of the ARMM bureaucracy to create a more development-oriented, results-driven \ngovernment  machinery;  (vi)  sustainable  fiscal  administration  through  strengthened  revenue \npolicies  and  administration;  (vii)  acceleration  and  improvement  of  implementation  of  ODA \nprojects  focused  on  institutional  and  capacity  building,  human  resource  development,  and \ngovernance; and (viii) building effective partnerships. \n \n7.  The ARMM is receiving significant assistance from international development partners to \nimplement priority reforms for institutional strengthening and capacity building. The second \nphase of the ARMM Social Fund for Peace and Development is expected to commence early in \n2003,  for  5  years  funded  by  the  World  Bank  ($34million)  and  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency (CIDA) ($10 million). It focuses on sustaining peace-building through \ncommunity-driven development. CIDA-LGSP is providing further capacity building assistance to \n23 LGUs within the ARMM. Extensive consultations have been held between ADB, the ARMM \ngovernment, the World Bank, and CIDA-LGSP to ensure that assistance is complementary. This \nTA will focus on capability building at the regional level to enhance governance. Other ADB \nassistance in the ARMM focuses on enhancing service delivery in specific sectors, such as \neducation. ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  long-term  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  to  enhance  decentralization  and  good \ngovernance in the ARMM through institutional strengthening, capacity building, and increased \npublic participation. The purpose of the TA is to raise the capability of the ARMM in public \nadministration, revenue generation, and good governance. This will contribute ultimately to the \nenhancement of service delivery in this impoverished region. \n \n9.  The TA consists of four components: (i) policy and legislative review, (ii) human resource \ndevelopment,  (iii)  revenue  analysis  and  enhancement,  and  (iv)  public  awareness  and \ncommunications. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Component 1:  Policy and Legislative Review. The legal framework within the ARMM \nhas not been reviewed or amended to take account of the expansion of the region and other \nnew  provisions  under  the  revised  RA  9054.  Likewise,  a  thorough  assessment  of  the \nimplementation experience of the regional local government code has not been conducted.  A \ncomprehensive review of both laws is necessary to (i) evaluate if the provisions adequately \nsupport the regional autonomy of ARMM, (ii) ensure consistency between the two laws, (iii) \nidentify provisions of the regional local government code that require amendment, (iv) provide \nthe basis for clarifying the roles and functions of regional government, and (iv) help assess \ncapacity within the regional government to meet its mandates. Assistance will be given in \ndrafting necessary amendments. The policy and legislative review phase will precede other \nactivities as it sets the framework for other TA activities, although drafting of legal amendments \nwill be undertaken after completion of component 3. \n \n11.  Both  the  regional  government  and  local  government  units  are  advocating  greater \ndevolution of service delivery functions within the ARMM. This is supported by executive order \n125  (2002) of the national Government, which enhances the devolution of powers and functions \nof national Government agencies to the ARMM, particularly those related to implementation of \nODA projects. Policy recommendations on enhancing devolution and service delivery will be \nbased on (i) an assessment of implementation of the local government code in ARMM; and (ii) \ncase studies of Basilan and the City of Marawi, which were operating under the national local \ngovernment code, before joining the ARMM in 2000. \n \n12.  The Office of the Regional Governor (ORG) produced the Executive Agenda for Peace \nand Development, which sets the strategic directions of the administration and identifies priority \nreforms. However, to give life to these priorities they need to be translated into a comprehensive \naction plan, that sets policy priorities, identifies an appropriate sequencing of reforms, and sets \ninterim and long-term performance targets. Assistance will be given to prepare the action plan \nand to draft enabling laws. The ORG\u2019s capacity for policy analysis, policy formulation, and \nadvocacy will be strengthened through this process. Assistance will be provided to both ORG \nand permanent RLA staff to draft priority bills.  \n \n \n \n  ", "4 \n13.  Component  2:  Human  Resource  Development.  The  regional  government  in \nconjunction  with  other  development  partners  is  reviewing  its  organizational  structures, \nprocesses, and procedures to enhance its ability to meet its mandates under RA 9054 and to \nincrease transparency and accountability. To complement this, a thorough assessment will be \ndone  of  the  current  human  resource  capacity  including  the  systems  and  procedures  for \nrecruitment, promotion, personnel management, and capacity building. The TA will provide \nrecommendations  on  (i)  a  comprehensive  human  resource  development  plan,  taking  into \nconsideration the legal mandates clarified in component 1; (ii) organizational restructuring; (iii) \nthe priorities of the Regional Executive Agenda; and (iv) measures to reduce personnel costs. \nRecommendations will focus on measures to enhance the professionalism and performance \norientation of the bureaucracy. The capacity of the RLA to draft enabling legislation will also be \nassessed, as many members of the RLA are newly elected. \n \n14.  An essential component of the human resource development plan will be an assessment \nof the capacity building requirements of all regional agencies and RLA legal staff. In particular \ncapacity building will focus on  (i) building capacity within ORG to formulate, analyze, and \nadvocate policies; (ii) building capacity in the proposed ODA unit within ORG to coordinate, \nmanage, and monitor ODA projects; (iii) strengthening regional agencies\u2019 capacity for project \nidentification, planning, implementation, and evaluation; and (iii) strengthening RLA\u2019s capacity \nfor drafting legislation. Training programs and materials will be designed, taking into account \nprograms available through other training providers such as the Local Government Academy of \nthe Philippines and local academic institutions, in order to enhance sustainability. \n    \n15.  Component  3:    Revenue  Policy  and  Administration.  As  highlighted,  RA  9054 \nprovides significant opportunities for the ARMM to generate revenues, but these are not being \nfully exploited. Policy studies will be undertaken to evaluate the revenue generation capacity of \nthe ARMM and to identify new avenues for enhancing revenue mobilization. The scope of the \nstudies will be based on information from component 1, but will include taxes, borrowing, issuing \nbonds, and other revenue sources. The studies should also identify the costs associated with \nrevenue-raising measures, the effectiveness of each revenue source, and sustainability. Current \nprocedures and systems for revenue administration will be reviewed to identify weaknesses and \ngaps.  These  reviews  will  serve  as  inputs  to  the  review  of  the  local  revenue  code.  A \ncomprehensive assessment of the ARMM Local Revenue Code is required to make it consistent \nwith RA 9054, strengthen provisions on revenue administration, and incorporate newly devolved \nand soon-to-be devolved revenue generating agencies such as the Regional Port Management \nAuthority.    \n \n 16.  The primary tax source of LGUs is the real property tax, yet real property assessments \nin the ARMM were last updated about 8 years ago. An assessment of the real property tax and \nits administration will be conducted, and recommendations made as to how the calculation and \nadministration can be improved. \n     \n 17.  Component 4:  Public Awareness, Communications and Dissemination. There is a \nlow level of awareness by officials and the public of RA 9054, the regional local government \ncode, and the Local Revenue Code, and consequently of the rights and responsibilities of all \nstakeholders  in  terms  of  these  laws.  The  regional  executive  agenda  should  be  widely \ndisseminated to generate public support for the reforms being advocated. The TA will develop \naccessible information materials for the public regarding their rights and responsibilities and will \nundertake consultation and dissemination activities with stakeholders. These activities will assist \nin the development of a strategy for enhancing public awareness and consultation on policy ", "    5 \nissues. Assistance will be given to the regional government to develop a taxpayer education \ncampaign, to encourage the payment of correct taxes. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent, comprising $225,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $635,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$600,000  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $375,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance $260,000 equivalent of the local costs, through the provision of office \naccommodation and facilities, use of equipment, administrative support, remuneration and per \ndiem of counterpart staff, counterpart staff travel, and staff training. A detailed cost estimate is \nprovided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Executing Agency will be the ARMM Regional Government. The Regional Planning \nand Development Office (RPDO) will be the implementing agency for day-to-day supervision of \nthe TA, under the supervision of the Director, RPDO. RPDO will provide logistical support to the \nconsultants  and  facilitate  access  to  information.  Relevant  national  government  agencies, \nspecifically the Department of Finance, the National Economic Development Authority, the \nDepartment of Budget and Management and Department of Interior and Local Government, will \nbe consulted as necessary to address inter-agency issues and to ensure policy consistency. \n \n20.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2003 and be implemented over 12 months. \nIt will require inputs of approximately 8 person-months of international and 35 person-months of \ndomestic consultants with expertise in public administration, local government, taxation and \nfiscal policy, communications, human resource development, and legislation drafting. Using the \nsimplified technical proposal format and quality and cost-based selection, the consultants will be \nengaged by ADB as a team in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \nTA consultants will be based in Cotabato City and will be required to travel to other parts of the \nARMM as necessary. Equipment for use of the consultants will be purchased in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and transferred to RPDO on completion of the TA. The \nproposed outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are included in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  Regional  Capacity  Building  and  Governance  for  an \nExpanded Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1
