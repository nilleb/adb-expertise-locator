Pakistan\u2019s  Balochistan  Province  has  an  area  of  347,190  square  kilometers  and  a \npopulation of 12.34 million. Over 75% of the population lives in rural areas, where agriculture is \nthe main source of livelihood, but agriculture is affected by water shortages, frequent droughts, \nand  poor  agricultural  infrastructure,  exposing  rural  communities  to  high  vulnerability.  The \nproposed Balochistan Water Resources Development Sector Project will be implemented in the \nZhob and Mula river basins of Balochistan, and will comprise three outputs: (i) the construction \nand/or rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and watershed protection, (ii) establishment and/or \nimprovement of command area, and (iii) strengthening of institutional capacity. The project \noutcome will be increased agriculture productivity in the project area. The project will be aligned \nwith  the  following  impacts:  (i)  increased  farm  income,  and  (ii)  improved  water  resource \nmanagement (WRM). The project is estimated to cost $136.14 million, of which $100.00 million \nwill be financed by Asian Development Bank (ADB) concessional ordinary capital resources, \n$31.14 million by the government, $3.00 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR), and $2.00 million from the High-Level Technology Fund. \n \n2.  The project will adopt an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach for \nthe irrigation development activities. It will support implementation of the IWRM policy, and in turn \nsupports  and  strengthens  several  principal  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  water  policy,  including:  (i) \nimproving  the  efficiency  of  water  use  and  delivery,  (ii)  fostering  water  conservation  and \nsustainability of infrastructure, and (iii) improving governance through beneficiary participation \nand capacity building.1 In addition to irrigation infrastructure, the project will help establish a water \nresource information system (WRIS) for improved WRM and monitoring, and address watershed \ndegradation by improving vegetative cover and undertaking physical interventions to reduce \nerosion in critical areas through integrated and participatory approaches.   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Balochistan is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts that threaten resource-poor \nfarmers and women in rural communities. The Government of Balochistan (GOB) adopted the \nIWRM policy in 2006 with ADB\u2019s support.2  The policy provides a comprehensive framework for \nthe province to address water management and development using the basin approach, with \nwater harvesting and groundwater recharging an integral part of watershed management. Since \nthen, useful progress has been made in implementing the policies, but expected outcomes \nindicated in the policy have not been achieved due to lack of funds, weak institutional capacity, \nand poor data support.  \n \n4.  The effective implementation of the IWRM policy requires quantitative, reliable surface \nwater and groundwater data, which are extremely limited in Balochistan. Moreover, there is no \nWRIS in Balochistan. The coverage and reliability of hydrological data are particularly poor, \npreventing well-informed planning and management of water resources. The province formerly \nhad a network to monitor scarce and depleted groundwater resources in Pishin\u2013Lora basin and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of ADB. Manila. \n2  GOB, Department of Irrigation and Power. 2006. Integrated Water Resources Management Policy Balochistan: \nApproved Policy Document. Quetta. The policy was prepared under TA for Supporting Public Resource Management \nReforms in Balochistan financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grants to the Islamic Republic \nof Pakistan for the Balochistan Resource Management Program. Appendix 8. Manila). \n ", "2 \nsurface water in major river basins, but most of the monitoring network is no longer functional \nbecause of inadequate funding support.  \n \n5.  Balochistan lacks a provincial climate change policy, despite facing increased impacts \nfrom climatic variability coupled with extreme drought and flood events; meanwhile, the existing \nIWRM policy does not address potential risks, including droughts, floods, and groundwater \ndepletion. The technical assistance (TA) will help strengthen Balochistan\u2019s institutional capacity \nto address exposed climate change impacts and risks and build climate-resilient and sustainable \nWRM mechanisms that apply innovative, high-level WRIS technology. The TA is listed in the \nPakistan country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.
