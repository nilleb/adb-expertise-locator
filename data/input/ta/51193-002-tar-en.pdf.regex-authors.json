INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to enhance the capacity of \nthe national statistical systems (NSSs) of selected developing member countries (DMCs). The \nDevelopment Economics and Indicators Division (ERDI) of the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation  Department  (ERCD)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  undertaken \nstatistical capacity building initiatives, and this TA, as one of these initiatives, supports the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through technology-focused capacity building.1  \n \n2.  The project is part of the approved 2018 ERCD work plan2 and is linked to the Global \nAction Plan for Sustainable Development Data through SDG target 17.19, which aims to \u201cbuild on \nexisting  initiatives  to  develop  measurements  of  progress  on  sustainable  development  that \ncomplement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity building in developing \ncountries\u201d by 2030.3 The project is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030, wherein both DMCs and ADB \npledge support to the SDGs and the related Financing for Development agenda, among others.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  High-quality data are important to monitor the progress made toward the objectives of the \nSDGs. The use of technology in statistics can significantly improve the timeliness and efficiency \nof collecting, processing and disseminating SDG data, besides reducing costs and facilitating \nseamless information flow across multiple data stakeholders. \n \n4.  While national statistics offices (NSOs) in Asia and the Pacific have made significant \nprogress in compiling data relevant to the SDGs, they have not been fully harnessing the power \nof technology for such purposes. DMC NSOs continue to compile and disseminate statistics \nthrough  relatively  outdated  and  inefficient  means,  adversely  affecting  data  quality.  Many \ninternationally mandated statistical standards are yet to be fully implemented in the DMCs. \n \n5.  The TA\u2019s objective is to contribute to the advancement of NSOs and other line ministries \ncomprising of the NSS through statistical and technological capacity building initiatives to meet \nthe increased data requirements of the SDGs. It will also facilitate adoption of international \nstatistical standards and enhanced dissemination of data.  \n \n6.  To achieve this objective, the TA will focus on technological solutions to improve the \nquality and costs associated with producing SDG statistics across five areas: (i) the development \nof customizable software to digitize sampling frames for administrative and survey data; (ii) the \nenhancement of national accounts and statistical infrastructure; (iii) accurate and detailed labor \nstatistics using updated standards and advanced computing methods; (iv) dissemination of data \nusing modern tools; and (v) knowledge sharing on innovations in statistics to improve the quality \nof official statistics. \n \n7.  Selection of the DMCs will vary by TA component and will be broadly based on the \nfollowing criteria: the DMC should (i) currently be engaged in at least one of the five areas listed \nin para. 6; (ii) have access to relevant survey, census, administrative, or nontraditional data; (iii) \nhave a qualified pool of staff, including both men and women, who can be trained in the relevant \n                                                \n1 Phase 1 of Data for Development, which is currently ongoing, covers three main components: (i) subnational \ndisaggregation of the SDGs, (ii) enhanced compilation of national accounts, and (iii) provision of strategic inputs for the \nmodernization of NSSs. ERDI has completed the inception workshop and ERDI is conducting a series of training \nactivities on small area estimation, big data, and national accounts. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 October 2018. \n3 United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for SDGs.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: data-driven monitoring of development goals \nand evidence-based policy making increased.5 The TA will have the following outcome: capacity \nof  NSSs  to  meet  increased  data  requirements  of  SDGs  enhanced.6 The  TA  will  support \nknowledge outputs through innovative technology infrastructure, data sources, and methods to \nstrengthen capacity of NSSs in five areas: (i) sampling frames; (ii) national accounts and statistical \ninfrastructure; (iii) labor force statistics; (iv) data visualization, anonymization, and exchange; and \n(v) knowledge sharing to enhance the quality of official statistics. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n1.  Sampling Frames \n \n9.  Output 1: Customizable software to digitize sampling frames developed. The TA will \nintegrate different data sources to develop customizable applications to digitize existing sampling \nframes in three selected DMCs. This builds on previous statistics capacity building projects on \ntechnological innovations supported by ERDI.7 Staff from NSOs and other line ministries will \nparticipate in field-based pilot testing activities to fine-tune the software to meet the specifications \nof their respective DMC. ERDI will prepare a technical report on the benefits of digitization. \n  \n10.  Output 2: Online course on digitizing sampling frames developed. The TA team will \ndevelop a freely accessible online training course using the massive open online courses format \nto disseminate the software applications developed as part of output 1 to other DMCs. ERDI will \nmake  the  digitization  software  publicly  available  along  with  an  instruction  manual,  helping \ndisseminate the know-how, skills, and experiences of participating DMCs to other DMCs. \n \n2.  National Accounts and Statistical Infrastructure \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity in compiling the System of National Accounts enhanced. ERDI \nwill facilitate the production of high-quality economic statistics by the NSOs of at least three DMCs \nadhering to the System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 recommendations.8 Some DMCs \nparticipating in previous projects have expressed interest in the compilation of SNA-consistent \ndatasets.9 ERDI and NSOs will construct at least one of the SNA components. \n               \n12.  Output 4: Statistical business register system installed and operationalized.10 ERDI \nwill install the ADB\u2019s statistical business register (SBR) system in at least three DMCs. ERDI will \nalso conduct training to enhance the technical capacity of the NSOs in using the SBR.      \n \n                                                \n5 Project defined. \n6 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n7 ADB. 2013.

Output 5: Workshops on latest standards in compiling labor statistics conducted. \nThe 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) recommended more refined \ndefinitions for \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cemployment.\u201d Further, ICLS proposed a set of new measures of labor \nunderutilization to complement the data on unemployment rates, particularly targeting gender. \nERDI, through a strategic partnership with the International Labour Organization, will conduct \nworkshops to build the statistical capacity of NSOs on the production of labor-related SDG \nindicators.11 ERDI will prepare a report on lessons learned in adopting the new definitions.  \n \n14.  Output 6: Global standards for enhanced compilation of labor force statistics \nimplemented. The TA will provide technical and financial assistance to one DMC in redesigning \na labor force survey to align it with the new definitions recommended by the 19th ICLS and explore \nadding policy-relevant information such as details on job turnover, workplace benefits, and \nenterprise characteristics (for wage and salaried workers). This output is in line with the Asian \nDevelopment Outlook 2018, which highlights the need for a well-designed labor force survey that \ncan capture emerging trends in the labor market.12 ERDI will prepare a technical report on the \nsurvey implementation and lessons learned. \n \n15.  Output 7: Administrative data to complement labor force survey data assessed. \nERDI will assess administrative labor data collection systems in the DMCs and provide training \nto NSOs on using administrative data collection systems to address the data gaps in labor force \nand household surveys. ERDI will develop a road map for DMCs to assess administrative data \nsources and determine a plan of action for these data sources to be utilized to enhance the \ncompilation of labor- and employment-related indicators. \n \n4.  Data Visualization, Anonymization, and Exchange \n \n16.  Output 8: Training on data visualization and anonymization conducted. ERDI will \ntrain NSO officials from at least one DMC on data visualization and microdata anonymization. \n \n \n17.  Output 9: Implementation of Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange standards \nenhanced. The TA will assist one DMC in implementing Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange \n(SDMX), an international initiative aimed at standardizing the mechanisms and processes for the \nexchange of statistical data and metadata. \n \n18.  Output 10: Training on the adoption of Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange \nstandards  conducted.  The  TA  will  facilitate  strategic  partnerships  with  SDMX  sponsor \norganizations13 and DMCs to develop the capacity of NSOs in implementing SDMX standards. \nERDI will conduct workshops to support the implementation of SDMX. ERDI will prepare a report \non the feasibility of the implementation of SDMX in the DMCs. \n \n5.  Knowledge Sharing to Enhance the Quality of Official Statistics \n \n19.  Output  11:  Capacity  developed  through  participation  in  conferences  and \nworkshops.14 The TA will support ADB staff, and selected government officials and researchers \n                                                \n11 ERDI will explore collaboration with the International Labour Organization and other development partners in \nconducting workshops and producing joint publications. \n12 ADB. 2018.
