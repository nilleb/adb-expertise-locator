INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to improve the quality of \neducation in Mongolia by (i) strengthening institutional systems and capacity to implement the \neducation sector  medium-term  development  plan  (ESMTDP),  (ii)  enhancing  online  learning \nsystems and resources, and (iii) improving the professional development systems and capacity \nof teachers. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan  for  Mongolia,  2021. 1  It  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  plans  for  \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality, and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In 2017, ADB approved a TA project to support the development of an education sector \nmaster plan, 2021\u20132030 for Mongolia.3 The TA aimed to strengthen planning and management \nof the education system through three outputs (i) establishing management and coordination \nmechanisms,  (ii) completing  in-depth  education sector studies  and  reviews  of international \nexperience and lessons, and (iii) developing the ESMTDP and expenditure framework. The TA \nachieved its objectives, and the Government of Mongolia approved the ESMTDP in November \n2020.4 The ESMTDP is aligned with Mongolia\u2019s Vision 20505 and the Government Action Plan \nfor 2020\u20132024.6 The ESMTDP priorities are: (i) to improve education quality and relevance; (ii) to \npromote  equal  access  and  inclusiveness;  and  (iii)  to  enhance  efficiency  of  governance, \nmanagement, and administration. The ESMTDP aims to develop system of open, distance, online \nand flexible learning pathways through the information and communication technologies that \nensures education quality and relevance at all levels with shared responsibilities and efficient \nmanagement and administration. \n \n4.  Implementation challenges. Implementation of the ESMTDP started in 2021. However, \nimplementation has been hampered by (i) inadequate institutional mechanisms and systems, \nincluding  the  absence  of  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  system,  and  \n(ii) understaffing and frequent turnover of management and staff at the Ministry of Education and \nScience (MES) and associated educational institutions.7 Therefore, comprehensive support is \nneeded to strengthen the institutional capacity of the MES; the Mongolia Institute of Education \nResearch (MIER), which is responsible for ESMTDP implementation and monitoring; and the \nInstitute of Teacher\u2019s Professional Development (ITPD), which is responsible for teachers\u2019 training. \nThe ESMTDP  implementation  has  been  also facing challenges caused  by the  unpredicted \nimpacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The poor learning outcomes that \nexisted before the COVID-19 outbreak have been exacerbated by the pandemic. \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2021. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 October 2021. \n2  ADB. 2019.

While MES has been implementing \nmeasures to sustain the quality of and access to education during lockdowns through e-learning \nplatforms  and/or  classes  on  television,  both  access  and  quality  have  been  affected  by  \n(i) inadequate information and communication technology infrastructure, especially in remote \nareas with poor access to electricity and the internet; (ii) a lack of sustainable and efficient online \ndistance learning platforms and resources; and (iii) teachers\u2019 unpreparedness for online distance \nlearning. A survey by MES and MIER found that 40%\u201350% of students are not being able to cope \nwith their curriculum and learning loads.8 Based on the \u201cAll for Education!\u201d National Civil Society \nCoalition\u2019s survey, 77.3% of teachers indicated that their workload was higher than before. The \nteacher training is generally limited due to budget constraints and insufficient capacity of ITPD. In \naddition,  limited  continuing  professional  development  opportunities  are  provided  for  school \nteachers and managers. Therefore, teachers need better methodological and technical support \nfor online teaching and formative assessment to track student progress in learning and target \nlagging students.9 \n \n6.  Gender impacts. The disruption to education systems has had a huge impact on the \neducation of girls, given limited access to online distance learning during school closures. Even \nbefore COVID-19, about 73% of the primary school aged children who were out of school in \nMongolia were girls. COVID-19 is expected to exacerbate this trend.10 A well-established M&E \nsystem is needed to regularly collect relevant sex-disaggregated data and analyze the situation \nto come up with comprehensive solutions for addressing the problem. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: education sector performance improved \n(footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: enhanced institutional capacity in managing \nquality education system applied.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Institutional mechanisms and capacity to implement the education sector \nmedium-term development plan strengthened. This output will support the following activities: \n(i)  Enhanced  web-based  M&E  system  for  the  education  sector  medium-term \ndevelopment plan established. The system will be developed to track the progress \nof ESMTDP implementation. TA consultants will review and finalize the list of \nESMTDP key performance indicators, which are consistent with the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4. The web-based system will be \nsynchronized with the education sector information system. \n(ii)  Capacity of the management and staff of the Ministry of Education and Science, \nits associated institutions, and local education departments improved. The TA \n \n8  MES and MIER. Mongolia: Survey on Student Learning Gap. Unpublished. \n9 The proposed TA for Mongolia on Supporting the Implementation of Education Sector Medium-Term Development \nPlan will be supporting the implementation of the MES Comprehensive Plan for Learning Loss Recovery in Primary \nand Secondary Education, 2021\u20132023. This focuses on capacity building of school managers and teachers through \nstudents\u2019  assessment,  blended  learning  methods,  and  post-COVID-19  recovery  through  the  design  and \nimplementation of continuing professional development program. \n10 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). 2019.

Bangkok. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nconsultants  and  resource  persons  will  conduct  training  and  workshops  with \nmanagement and staff to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ESMTDP \nimplementation, and M&E. Capacity building will be in the form of blended training \n(both online and in-person learning experiences when teaching students) and \nother activities, such as exchanges of experience and institution-based mentoring.  \n(iii)  Education sector partner coordination mechanism improved. The MES-Education \nDonors\u2019 Consultative Mechanism reviews the progress of the implementation of \nthe education sector master plan and discuss issues related to the education \nsector  development  partners.  This  mechanism  was  re-activated  during  the \nESMDTDP  development  and  renamed  to  local  education  group.  The  local \neducation group helps to reduce overlaps and ensures synergies between different \ninterventions supported by development partners. \n(iv)  To improve coordination, a local education group communication plan will be \ndeveloped for ESMTDP implementation. The MES will lead and co-chair the local \neducation group and report on ESMTDP implementation progress. \n \n9.  Output 2: Online distance learning and evaluation systems and resources enhanced. \nThis output will focus on improving gender-sensitive online distance learning through the following: \n(i)  Online distance learning resource development framework designed, and online \ncontent  and  learning  materials  in  two  subjects,  Mongolian  language  and \nmathematics, collected and prepared.12 A conceptual framework will be prepared \nfor the  development  of online  distance  learning content  and materials for  all \nsubjects and grades. The TA will also support the national specialists in developing \nonline  gender-sensitive  learning content focusing  on two  subjects, Mongolian \nlanguage and mathematics, at primary grades (2, 3, and 5) and secondary grades \n(6, 9, and 10) based on the framework. The online content will include (a) teaching \ndemonstrations of the subjects, supplementary exercises, and assignments for \nreinforcing students\u2019 learning in the classroom; (b) formative self-assessment tools \nand tasks;13 and (c) project-based learning activities.14 \n(ii)  Framework of education evaluation online platform developed. The TA team \nwill conduct a comprehensive assessment of the existing education evaluation \nsystem, along with its online elements, to identify gaps, needs, and the resources \nrequired to develop a comprehensive online platform that covers pre-primary, \nprimary, secondary, and higher education. \n \n10.  Output 3: Teachers\u2019 professional development strengthened. The TA consultants and \nresource persons will train 30 ITPD trainers with module trainings. The ITPD trainers will then \ndeliver  a module  training  on Mongolian  language  and mathematics  to 16,987  primary  and \nsecondary school teachers. The training will cover managing online or hybrid learning systems \nand developing and using online distance learning resources. One module will help parents \nsupport their children\u2019s learning.15 \n \n12 In 2019, the results of the Education Evaluation Center of Mongolia\u2019s assessment of early grade reading, and \nmathematics were quite poor. \n13 Assessments carried out during a learning\u2013teaching process, while still in progress, are usually referred to as \nformative assessments. \n14 According to MES assessment, grades 5, 6, 9, and 10 are considered as transition grades where students tend to \nstruggle more in learning. \n15 ITPD will also consult with the Federation of\u202fMongolian\u202fEducation and Science\u202fUnions and the Parent-Teacher \nAssociation of Mongolia during the design and implementation of the trainings.  \n \n ", "4 \n11.  Innovation and value added. The TA will introduce innovation to Mongolia\u2019s education \nsector by (i) introducing a web-based M&E system for ESMTDP implementation; (ii) designing an \nonline distance learning resource development framework, including quality criteria and technical \nspecifications for the development of online distance content, and learning materials for all \nsubjects and grades; and (iii) developing a framework of an education evaluation online platform. \nSince 1992, ADB has provided knowledge and investment support to Mongolia\u2019s education sector \nincluding development of education sector master plans. This TA will support implementation of \nESMTDP which was developed with support of donor community.16  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $605,000, of which (i) $50,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($4,000 from TASF 6 and $46,000 from TASF-\nothers); and (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation \nfor consultants, venues for meetings, and miscellaneous administrative expenses. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The ADB East Asia Department\u2019s Urban and Social Sectors Division will administer the \nTA and recruit and supervise consultants. The MES will be the executing agency and the Policy \nPlanning Department, MES will be the implementing agency. For day-to-day administration, the \nTA will recruit an education specialist (who will also be the TA coordinator) and a finance and \nadministration specialist. The two specialists will help the consultants produce the TA outputs and \ndeliverables in a timely and effective manner, as well as organize and carry out all TA activities. \nThe TA coordinator and the finance and administration specialist will report to the ADB project \nofficer and the MES. \n \n15.
