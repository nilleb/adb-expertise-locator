Initial environmental examinations \nAssessment  (IEEs) for the Project have been completed. The summary IEE is in \nAppendix 15.  \n   \nProject  The Project has four components: (i) construction of 353 kilometers (km) \nDescription  of gas transmission pipelines for transporting 360 million cubic feet per \n  day (MMCFD) of natural gas to expand the gas supply network to the less \n  developed region of the country, (ii) field appraisal and survey of an area \n  of about 1,250 km2 encompassing five gas fields to delineate available \n  reserves, (iii) 200 km gas distribution network in Rajshahi area, and (iv) \n  support for building the capacity of gas sector agencies.  \n   \nRationale  The relatively low utilization of natural gas in Bangladesh has constrained \nthe commercial, industrial, and rural development of the country. The \ncountry\u2019s  gas  infrastructure  is  in  poor  condition  due  to  a  lack  of \ncommercial  orientation  and  inadequate  funding  for  maintenance  and \nexpansion.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  emphasizes \nimplementation of policies directed toward expanding the national gas grid \nto  cover  less  developed  regions  of  the  country,  and  to  promote \nindustrialization and accelerate balanced regional development that would \nhelp reduce widespread poverty. In this regard, further development of the \nmain  natural  energy  resource  in  Bangladesh  to  meet  the  increasing \ndemand for primary commercial energy is vital. Natural gas provides 90% \nof  fuel  for  power  generation.  It  is  a  clean  source  of  energy  bringing \nsignificant environmental and social benefits through reduced ambient \nand indoor air pollution. \n \nPetrobangla has formulated an investment plan for oil, gas, and mineral \nresources for the period 2002\u20132020 that envisages investments of $3 \nbillion  for  the  gas  sector  including  exploration,  field  development, \ntransmission, and distribution. The investment plan, which is based on a \nstudy financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), includes several \nprojects  likely  to  be  taken  up  by  the  private  sector.  To  support  the \ninvestment plan, the Government developed a gas sector reform road \nmap (GSRR), which will be implemented over 5 years. The GSRR covers \n(i)  institutional  and  financial  restructuring  of  gas  sector  companies  to \nensure  long-term financial  sustainability; (ii) strengthening  public\u2013private \npartnership in the gas sector aimed at creating an environment for private \nsector-led  growth;  (iii)  transformation  of  gas  companies  to  diversify \nownership involving private investors; (iv) restructuring and unbundling \ngas  sector  institutions  and  enterprises;  and (v) market-oriented  energy \n ", "ii   \n  pricing  reflecting  energy  parity,  eliminating  noneconomic  factors  and \nlevies,  and  equating  gas  prices  from  the  state-owned  gas-producing \ncompanies with those from international oil companies. ADB has worked \nextensively with the Government on developing the GSRR. \n \n  ADB support is considered crucial for three main reasons: (i) to maintain \ncontinued policy dialogue on the development and implementation of the \nGSRR in support of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy; (ii) to \ncontinue dialogue on improving sector governance; and (iii) to introduce \nbest practices on safeguard issues such as environment, resettlement, \nand other social matters.  \n   \nImpact and  The main impact of the Project is meeting gas requirements to support the \nOutcome  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  The  primary  outcome  is  to  improve  and \nexpand the natural gas infrastructure, in particular gas transmission and \ndistribution network systems, by providing the most needed investment \nand field appraisal support for gas sector companies. The Project will also \nimprove sector governance and ensure long-term financial viability and \nimprove efficiency indicators of gas sector entities through institutional \nstrengthening and implementation of the GSRR. \n \nThe Project and the associated GSRR will enhance the role of the private \nsector  in  natural  gas-related  activities  including  (i)  upstream  gas \ndevelopment;  (ii)  gas  transmission  and  distribution;  and  (iii)  metering, \naudit, and operation and maintenance activities.  The private sector will \nalso have an enhanced role in gas-based or related industries, power \nplants, and other manufacturing and processing activities. The Project\u2019s \nphysical  investments  are  the  most  urgent  requirements  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s gas sector investment program. The Project will have the \nfollowing components: \n \nPart A: Gas Transmission \n \n(i)  Ashuganj  west-Jamuna  Bridge  east  bank  gas  transmission \npipeline:  construction  of  a  30-inch-diameter,  51  km  gas \ntransmission pipeline from Manohardi to Dhanua and Elenga to the \neast  end  of  Jamuna  Bridge  and  installation  of  compression \nfacilities at Ashuganj (west) and Elenga with a throughput of 390 \nMMCFD. \n \n(ii)  Hatikumrul-Ishwardi-Bheramara  gas  transmission  pipeline: \nconstruction  of  a  24-inch-diameter,  87  km  gas  pipeline  from \nHatikumrul  to  Bheramara  through  the  Sirajganj,  Natore,  Pabna \nand Kushtia districts to transmit 235 MMCFD of gas. (The pipeline \nsize  may  be  increased  to  30-inch-diameter  during  the  detailed \ndesign stage if such change is proven prudent). \n \n(iii)  Bonpara-Rajshahi gas transmission pipeline: construction of a 12-\ninch-diameter, 60 km gas pipeline from Bonpara to Rajshahi with a \nthroughput of 25\u201330 MMCFD. ", "  iii\n  (iv)  North\u2013south  system  expansion:  installation  of  compressors  at \nMuchai  and  Ashuganj  (south)  with  throughputs  of  370\u2013890 \nMMCFD. \n \n(v)  Bheramara-Khulna gas transmission pipeline: construction of a 20-\ninch-diameter, 165 km gas pipeline from Bheramara to Khulna \nthrough Kushtia, Jessore, and Khulna districts, with a throughput \nof 75\u2013125 MMCFD.  \n   \nPart B: Field Appraisal  \n \nFive producing gas fields will be appraised to update information on the \nestimated gas in place, and to determine the optimum location for future \nproduction drilling activities. The three-dimensional survey is expected to \nresult  in  upgrading  proven  reserves  estimates.  No  new  exploration \nactivities are involved. \n \nPart C: Rajshahi Area Gas Distribution \n \nConstruction of about 320 km of 1- to 8-inch-diameter gas distribution \nnetwork in the Rajshahi area, western Bangladesh.  \n \nPart D: Capacity Building \n \nStrengthen  policy-making  capabilities  of  the  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources Division (EMRD) of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral \nResources (MPEMR). Capacity building will include training EMRD and \nPetrobangla  and  its  companies  on  corporate  governance,  financial \nmanagement, e-governance, and gas system management. In addition, \nthis component will support the implementation of the gas sector system \nloss reduction plan. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies \nand  financing  charges,  is  estimated  at  $413  million  equivalent.  The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $235 million and the local currency \ncost at $178 million equivalent.

The Bangladesh Petroleum \nExploration  Company  Limited  (BAPEX)  will  act  as  the  Implementing \nAgency for Part B.  \n   \nImplementation  The  day-to-day  project  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  project \nArrangements  management units (PMUs) already set up specifically for the Project by \nthe EAs. Petrobangla will establish a project coordination unit (PCU) for \ncoordinating matters related to the project components. MPEMR has a \nsteering committee to coordinate and guide all foreign-funded projects \nand the Project will be guided by this interministerial steering committee at \nthe national level. \n   \nProcurement  Equipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of the \nADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  A  supply  contract,  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of \n$500,000  or  more,  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB);  a  contract  estimated  to  cost  less  than  the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  can  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping  (IS).  A  turnkey  contract  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of \n$500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB; one estimated to \ncost less than $500,000 can be awarded on the basis of IS.    \n   \nConsulting  To  ensure  timely  project  implementation,  consulting  services  will  be \nServices  required for assisting GTCL (part A), and BGFCL and SGFL (part B) in \nvarious  implementation  activities  including  design,  engineering, \nprocurement, construction, and training. Consulting services will also be \nrequired to build the capacity of EMRD, Petrobangla, GTCL, and other \nstate  gas  companies  (part  D).  The  EAs  will  engage  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants. \nConsultants will be engaged as a firm or on an individual basis.    \n   \nProject Benefits  The Project will create an efficient and viable gas sector infrastructure for \nand Beneficiaries  extending gas access to less developed areas of the country, promoting \nbalanced regional development.  It will also strengthen the capacity of gas \nsector-related entities to sustain efficiency improvements. The Project will \nmake clean energy available to a region with a population of nearly 15 \nmillion, creating positive impacts on the environment and public health, \nparticularly  for  women  and  the  poor  who  are  most  vulnerable  to  the \nharmful effects of fossil fuel and polluting biofuel use.  \n \n ", "vi   \n  Poverty analysis was undertaken during project preparation. The Project\u2019s \npoverty reduction impacts will be significant, particularly in less developed \nregions. Income levels are likely to increase due to new opportunities that \nare  expected  to  be  opened  up,  and  the  increase  in  employment \nopportunities  from  industrial  development and  other activities  related to \n  economic diversification. \n   \n  The Project will create about 3,000 person-months of job opportunities for \nunskilled  labor  and  will  increase  access  to  cleaner  fuel  for  power \ngeneration,  transport,  and  household  use.  Air  quality  improvement  in \nurban centers and indoors will be substantial. \n \nThe Project is financially sound and economically viable, with a financial \nrate of return of 12% and a minimum economic internal rate of return of \n28.1%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project remains viable under \nadverse conditions. \n   \nRisks and  Project  components  are  not  subject  to  any  unusual  technical  or \nAssumptions  commercial risks. Technical design has included adequate precautions \nsuch as concrete lining and reinforcements. Assurance for counterpart \nfunding arrangement ensures availability of local currency. Participating \ncompanies  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  loan.  The  gas \ncompanies (GTCL, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company \nLimited [TGTDCL], BGFCL, and SGFL) have the capacity to manage \nforeign exchange risks as their revenues are adjusted to foreign exchange \nrate fluctuations. \n \nThe  potential  policy  risk  relates  to  failure  or  delay  in  implementing \nrequired reform and restructuring measures. Continued policy dialogue \nwith the Government on the agreed upon time frame to implement the \nGSRR would alleviate this risk. Another concern is the availability of the \nrequired  gas  supply  during  the  Project\u2019s  economic  life.  Bangladesh\u2019s \nexploration-to-discovery  ratio  is  significantly  high.  With  adequate \ninvestments, such risk can be mitigated. Furthermore, the Government \nhas agreed to encourage and accelerate exploration activities in both \npublic and private sectors to ensure timely replacement of reserve and \ngas availability.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, for the Gas Transmission and Development Project. \nThe project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Natural Gas Resources \n \n2.  Natural  gas  was  discovered  in  Bangladesh  in  1955.  Opening  gas  exploration  and \nproduction to international oil companies (IOCs) started in the early 1990s through production \nsharing contracts (PSCs). The arrangement has contributed immensely to improved gas supply \nin recent years. Total proven and recoverable gas reserves from 22 fields (18 public sector and \n4 private sector fields) are estimated at 20.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 5.09 TCF has \nbeen  consumed.  Taking  discovered  and  undiscovered  reserves  together,  there  is  a  90% \nprobability that Bangladesh\u2019s gas resource will exceed 30 TCF. A recent study confirms these \nfigures.1 IOC production is predicted to comprise 30\u201345% of supply, with the balance from state-\nowned gas companies (SGC) during the next 12 years.  \n \n3.  In the last decade, gas consumption in Bangladesh rose from 172.7 billion cubic feet \n(BCF) to 331.2 BCF at an annual growth rate of 7%. From 2000 to 2004, gas consumption grew \nat an annual rate of 8%. The country\u2019s total present gas demand is about 1,350 million cubic \nfeet per day (MMCFD). Government estimates show that this will increase to 2,420 MMCFD in \n2015 and 3,785 MMCFD in 2025. On a cumulative basis, this is equivalent to a 5% annual \ngrowth rate and is considered conservative. If this trend persists, Bangladesh will require 105 \nMMCFD in 2018 and 4.47 TCF of additional gas from new discoveries by 2025 to meet the \ncommercial energy demand. Petrobangla has taken steps to increase the additional available \ngas up to 580 MMCFD by 2008, signing agreements to purchase and save gas from fields of \nSangu and Moularibazar and Bibiyana. All technical and geological exploratory studies indicate \nthat new discoveries will be available to meet the growing gas demand. Current discussions \namong governments on subregional cooperation on natural gas exploration, transmission, and \ndistribution would be beneficial to Bangladesh. Additional information on gas supply, demand, \ntariff,  institutions,  policies,  and  a  sector  assessment  is  in  Appendix  2  and  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n2.  Institutional Framework \n4.  In Bangladesh, the oil and gas sector is regulated and administered by the Government, \nbut there have been many initiatives for private sector participation (PSP) in some gas sector \nentities and activities during the last few years. The Government, through the Energy and \nMineral Resources Division (EMRD) of the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources \n(MPEMR), has the authority for policy formulation, investment decision, and regulation. In 1972, \nthe Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals Corporation (Petrobangla) was created as a state agency \nfor oil and gas exploration, production, transmission, and distribution. Over time, an unbundling \nprocess was completed by establishing separate companies for production, transmission, and \n                                                 \n1  Hydrocarbon Unit, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2002. Bangladesh Petroleum and Resource \nAssessment 2001. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \ndistribution. Today, Petrobangla as an umbrella agency directs day-to-day activities of nine \noperating companies.2 These SGCs are incorporated as public limited companies under the \nCompanies Act of 1994 and are governed by their own boards of directors. While the reform \nand  restructuring  process  of  gas  sector  entities  started  much  earlier  than  that  of  their \ncounterpart power sector entities, initial progress has not been maintained. The directors of \nthese companies include representatives from different chambers of commerce and industries, \nthough they are appointed by EMRD. The organization chart of Petrobangla and its linkages to \nthe SGS are given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  In the mid-1970s, the Government signed six PSCs with IOCs under the supervision of \nPetrobangla. Since 1994 when the second round of PSCs were entered into with the IOCs \nresponsible  for  drilling,  Petrobangla  has  served  as  supervisor  and  sole  purchaser  of  IOC \noutputs.  Due  to  IOC  involvement  in  production,  gas  supply  has  increased.  However,  the \nincreased supply is believed to have resulted in less pressure on authorities to continue with the \nneeded reforms in SGCs. Meanwhile, deficiencies in the gas supply in relation to demand as \nexperienced  in  recent  years  have  once  again  underscored  the  need  for  augmenting  gas \nexploration and production. A recent trend is creating an enabling environment for mobilizing \nprivate sector resources to finance required investments in these areas. A problem tree analysis \nis given in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n6.  Private sector involvement in marketing and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas and \ncompressed natural gas (CNG) has been initiated and is gathering momentum. Proposals for \nrestructuring  two  SGCs  (the  Bakhrabad  Gas  Systems  Limited  [BGSL]  and  Titas  Gas \nTransmission and Distribution Company Limited [TGTDCL]), and offloading shares of the Gas \nTransmission Company Limited (GTCL) are under consideration. The Government is aware that \nfuture sector governance strategies should emphasize mobilizing the private sector to support \nthe demand side of gas development, and increase production and supply. It is also aware of \nthe  importance  of  streamlining  the  Government\u2019s  role  in  ensuring  efficient  regulation  and \nresponsiveness to various stakeholder interests, expectations, and inputs.  \n \n7.  The legal framework for establishing the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC)3 was \nenacted on 13 March 2003. ERC became effective on 27 April 2004 with the appointment of two \nmembers, one of them acting as chairman. A recent amendment to the Act is designed to \nstreamline the selection process. ERC has neither an approved organizational structure nor \nstaff to undertake expected tasks. Thus far, ERC has not achieved expected results. In this \nregard,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  appoint  the  two  remaining  members  of  ERC,  and \nthereafter it must be able to function fully. The long-term funding of ERC should be settled \nquickly in a manner that will make it become, and remain, effective. ERC will take over the \nresponsibility of tariff setting and other regulating activities.  \n \n                                                 \n2  The nine companies are (i) Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited, (ii) Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and \nProduction Company Limited, (iii) Bakhrabad Gas Systems Limited, (iv) Gas Transmission Company Limited, (v) \nJalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution Systems Limited, (vi) Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited, (vii) \nRupantarita  Prakritik  Gas  Company  Limited  (RPGCL),  (viii)  Sylhet  Gas  Fields  Limited,  and  (ix)  Titas  Gas \nTransmission and Distribution Company Limited. \n3  ADB\u2019s support in conjunction with the Third National Gas Development Project (TNGDP) subsequently helped the \ninitial drafting of the regulatory framework and key regulations that led to the creation of ERC (ADB. 1993. \nTechnical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Preparation of a Gas System Development \nPlan and the Strengthening of the Organizational and Regulatory Framework for the Oil and Gas Sector.

The Hydrocarbon Unit (HCU) was established in 1994 as a condition for the Third \nNatural Gas Development Project (TNGDP).4 It acts as the technical arm of EMRD for upstream \ngas activities and has the following objectives: (i) assessment of reserve and undiscovered \nresource  at  regular  intervals,  (ii)  data  management  in  the  gas  sector,  (iii)  overview  and \nobservation  on  PSCs,  (iv)  internal  and  regional  gas  market  analysis,  (v)  formulation  of \nexploration and depletion policy, and (vi) establishment of contact forums for the private sector. \nSince 1999, the Norwegian Government has been supporting HCU in capacity building.5 To \nstrengthen overall gas sector planning and policymaking, the Government intends to make HCU \na regular part of EMRD. The Bangladesh Petroleum Institute (BPI), established as a project in \n1981 and converted into a legal entity in June 2004, gives training to gas sector entities. HCU \nand BPI require further capacity building to promote gas sector development. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.  System Loss \n \n9.  Under the TNGDP that closed on 23 Oct 2003, the Government agreed that BGSL and \nthe  Jalalabad  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Systems  Ltd  (JGTDSL)  maintain  system \nlosses in their respective franchise areas at 2% or less for the duration of the Project. BGSL \nmaintained system losses less than 2% up to 1999. The losses went up to 4.08% in 2001/02 but \nhave come down to about 1% in the past 2 years. JGTDSL maintained system losses less than \n2% throughout the project life except in 1994. In recent years the losses came down to less than \n1%. The Government also agreed that TGTDCL, with advice from consultants appointed under \nthe safety and efficiency technical assistance (TA),6 would maintain the level of system losses in \nits franchise area to 2% or less by 30 June 1995 and beyond. However, TGTDCL could not \nmaintain system loss to the stipulated level. Its system losses ranged from 6 to 9%. \n \n10.  A 2% transmission and distribution loss is an acceptable norm in the gas industry. The \ncost of gas system loss is substantial, estimated at about Tk2.4 billion. In addition, the cost of \ncollection inefficiency is also sizable. Assuming a norm of 98% collection-billing ratio, the cost of \ncollection shortfall is estimated at Tk1.8 billion. The TA made several recommendations and \ndeveloped a plan for reducing system loss that includes installation of meters, and privatization \nof meter reading and billing. The plan developed under the TA has been revised and was \nrecently adopted by TGTDCL under the supervision of Petrobangla. It is a comprehensive \nefficiency improvement and system loss reduction plan valid for the entire gas sector (Appendix \n3). The plan will be implemented during 2005\u20132010 in conjunction with the Project, to contain \nsystem losses at 2% or lower by 2010. (Further details on the system loss reduction plan are in \nSupplementary Appendix D.) Moreover, the Government intends to restructure TGTDCL in a bid \nto improve its management efficiencies. \n \n  2.  Financial Management  \n \n11.  During project processing, the financial management structure of SGCs was assessed. \nTheir financial accounting systems are computerized, with confidentiality and integrity at various \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1993.

Existence  of  well-defined  charts  of  accounts  allows  proper  recording  of  financial \ntransactions. Accounting policies, based on standards issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of Bangladesh, which are acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have \nbeen framed for accounting and preparation of financial statements. Responsibilities related to \naccounting and financial reporting are carried out based on delegation of powers defined and \napproved  by  SGCs\u2019  board  of  directors.  Their  finance  departments  have  developed  written \nprocedures and guidelines for reporting. \n \n3.  Financial Performance of Gas Sector Companies \n \n12.  Petrobangla obtains the bulk of its revenues from a management service charge levied \non SGCs. It earns interest income used to offset any operating deficit. In recent years, it has \nshown a net surplus on its activities. GTCL\u2019s revenues from gas transmission activities have \nincreased as a result of doubling gas transmission over the period 1999\u20132004. Although its debt \nservice coverage ratio (DSCR) exceeded 1.2 times debt obligations, the rate of return (ROR) \nwas 6% in 2004. GTCL was unable to make any significant contribution to its own capital \nexpenditure program out of revenues and is highly dependent on Government funds for major \ncapital expenditures. Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited\u2019s (BGFCL\u2019s) and SGCL\u2019s RORs \nin 2004 were 21% and 13%, respectively, while their DSCRs were well in excess of 1.2 times \ndebt obligations. Self-financing ratios (SFRs) for both companies exceeded 30% of annual \ncapital expenditure. Their capital structures are consistent with that expected for production \ncompanies. The high level of past ROR reflects mostly gas reserve assets at very low historic \ncosts, resulting in overstated returns. ROR for Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL) \nwas 16.7% in 2002, the second year of operation, but has been lower in succeeding years and \nin 2004 was 8.9%. The DSCR exceeded 1.2 times debt obligations over 2001 and 2003, but \nwas less than 1.0 in 2004. PGCL\u2019s capital structure is consistent with that expected for a \ndistribution company, with debt financing in its capital structure now in the order of 60%.  \n \n4.  Government Policies and Plans \n13.  The Government\u2019s overarching goal, as articulated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (PRSP) is to substantially reduce chronic poverty and invigorate social development in \nthe shortest possible time.7 In addition to specifying social targets in line with the country\u2019s \nmillennium  development  goals  (MDG),8  the  PRSP  commits  the  Government  to  halve  the \nproportion of population living below the poverty line from 50% in 2000 to 25% by 2015. To \nattain this target, Bangladesh needs to accelerate the pace of poverty reduction from 1.5% per \nyear observed in the 1990s to 3.3% for the period 2000\u20132015. The strategy recognizes the \nneed for accelerated economic growth as the main vehicle for reducing poverty. If the past \ntrends  of  income  inequality  persist  in  the  next  decade, Bangladesh  will  have  to  raise  the \neconomy\u2019s growth from about 5% per annum in recent years to 6\u20137% and sustain this growth \nrate over the next 15 years to reach the poverty reduction targets.  \n \n14.  Petrobangla\u2019s investment master plan for oil, gas, and mineral resources for the period \n2002\u20132020 envisages investments of almost $3 billion in the sector including exploration, field \ndevelopment, transmission and distribution.9 The plan includes several projects likely to be \n                                                 \n7  The PRSP is currently being finalized by the Government and development partners. The updated PRSP will \nprovide the basis for ADB-CSP, World Bank-Credit Authorization Scheme (CAS), Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) and Japan's support to Bangladesh over the medium term. \n8  World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 2003.

Washington DC \n(joint poverty assessment by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank). \n9  Prepared in 1997, under an ADB TA (footnote 3) attached to the TNGDP. \n ", "5 \ntaken up by the private sector. An investment of nearly $600 million is envisaged for oil and gas \nexploration, of which $200 million will be from the private sector, $470 million will be for field \nappraisal,  and  $93  million  for  workover  of  wells  to  sustain  production.  Gas  transmission \npipelines will require about $1.2 billion and distribution pipelines will require $33 million. It would \nbe  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for  Petrobangla  or  its  subsidiaries  to  mobilize  the  required \nresources to finance the envisaged investments unless adequate measures are in place to \npromote and encourage domestic and foreign private investment in the gas sector.  \n \n15.  Infrastructure,  particularly  energy,  will  play  a  very  significant  role  in  achieving  the \nenvisaged economic growth. Sustained economic growth will contribute to poverty reduction. \nInfrastructural  deficiencies  continue  to  act  as  a  major  impediment  to  Bangladesh\u2019s \ndevelopmental efforts. Reliable access to energy is essential for economic growth and hence \npoverty reduction. Noncommercial energy, mostly biomass, accounts for almost two-thirds of \nthe total energy consumption. Commercial energy is available to about 30% of the population as \nelectricity, and to about 8% of the population as hydrocarbons, liquid fuels, natural gas, or \nliquefied petroleum gas. Natural gas accounts for almost 70% of the commercial energy and \nabout 90% of electricity generation. Bangladesh\u2019s per capita consumption of commercial energy \nin various forms has improved rather slowly, from 126 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) in 1980 \nto 159 kgoe in 1998.10 To this end, the Government is implementing comprehensive sector \nreforms in energy development and management through a carefully sequenced approach to \nensure reduced physical distribution costs and improve service delivery to the poor areas.  \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \na.  Gas Sector Reform and Governance \n \n16.  According to the PRSP, the Government\u2019s sectoral development goals are to (i) provide \nenergy for sustainable economic growth and for maintaining energy security in the country; (ii) \nprovide energy to all socioeconomic groups in the country, especially to the less developed \nareas; (iii) diversify the use of indigenous energy; and (iv) contribute to the protection of the \nenvironment.  The  Government\u2019s  gas  sector  policy  also  provides  that  new  exploration  and \nproduction of oil and gas will predominantly be by the private sector through PSCs. While GTCL \nwill be responsible for gas transmission, PSP will be encouraged by allowing construction of \npipelines through build-own-operate-transfer contracts, with operations managed by GTCL. In \nSeptember 2004, the Government announced the private sector infrastructure guidelines that \nprovide for PSP in exploration, production, transmission, and distribution of oil and gas. Such \nprojects could be undertaken under build-own-operate (BOO) and build-operate-transfer (BOT). \nIn addition, the private sector\u2019s minority equity participation in GTCL will be encouraged. Gas \nmarketing and distribution will be commercialized and gradually privatized. The Government\u2019s \ngas sector reform road map (GSRR) is in Appendix 4. The GSRR, to be implemented over 5 \nyears, covers a wide range of important policy activities including revisions to the energy policy, \ndraft Gas Act, gas tariff setting, and sector regulatory mechanism. ADB has worked with the \nGovernment extensively on developing the GSRR.  \n \n17.  The Project addresses governance issues at two levels: first, at the sector level and \nsecond, at the enterprise level. Sector-level governance issues focus on sector reforms, tariff \ndetermination, setting up a regulator and defining its functions, and sustainability of energy \nsector operations. These are addressed by streamlining the approval process and implementing \n                                                 \n10 Both India and Pakistan, for instance, increased per capita energy consumption by 133 kgoe or four times \nBangladesh\u2019s improvement during the same period. \n ", "6 \nthe (i) energy policy, and (ii) Gas Act. Formal approval and adoption of the energy policy and \nthe Gas Act will provide a stronger legal basis for implementing sector governance issues in a \ntransparent and efficient manner. Implementation of the GSRR is the key to resolve many \nenterprise-level governance problems. Under the GSRR, several gas sector enterprises are \nrequired to undergo restructuring and establish accounting and business autonomy. The entities \nwill be accountable for their finances as well as their decision-making process. As stated in the \nGSRR, the Petrobangla Act will be reviewed to redefine the role of Petrobangla to suit the \nchanging business environment. The gas sector entities will also implement the gas system loss \nreduction plan (GSLRP) where gas theft and malpractices of meter reading will become illegal. \n \nb.  Private Sector Participation \n18.  The Government recognizes that the natural gas sector, with its large potential for \ncontributing  to  the  development  of  the  economy,  will  have  to  be  effectively  managed  to \nmaximize its role in poverty reduction and generation of equitable benefits. However, sector \nreforms have been implemented in an ad hoc manner, making it difficult for development \npartners and private investors to boost their contribution to the sector\u2019s substantial investment \nneeds. Efforts to expand energy coverage for the population will be accelerated to improve the \npoor\u2019s access to natural gas. The exploration and utilization of oil, gas, coal, and mineral \nresources will be expedited; foreign and private investment in these sectors will be encouraged; \nand capabilities of the relevant agencies will be built to achieve the goals.  \n \n19.  Public sector resources are limited to provide adequate support to meet the gas sector\u2019s \nessential investments such as increasing gas exploration, further expanding gas transmission \npipelines, and reactivating abandoned gas fields. The scale of the required investments in \nexploration implies a significant role for the private sector in this area, provided that right \nincentives  are  made  available  to  investors  such  as  an  adequate  business  environment. \nSubsequent to discussions with the Government, ADB approved TA to assist the Government in \npromoting  PSP  and  assuring  sustainable  development  in  the  gas  sector.11  A  detailed \nexamination of sector structure, unbundling of companies, and investment planning will be \nundertaken to meet the reform objectives and to facilitate greater PSP in the gas sector.  \n \nc.  Lessons Learned  \n20.   Since Bangladesh joined ADB in 1973, its energy sector has received 8 public sector \nloans for a total of about $446 million, and 16 TA grants totaling about $4.9 million from ADB. \nRecently ADB evaluated its power assistance program12 in Bangladesh and several key lessons \nwere drawn. They include the need to (i) minimize delays in project implementation; (ii) improve \nlocal  capacities  in  project  preparation,  implementation,  and  operation  and  selection  of \nappropriate technology; (iii) improve ownership of TAs; and (iv) improve financial management \ncapacities of the project implementing agencies. These lessons, which are typical of the energy \nsector as a whole, have been incorporated in designing the Project. More details on the lessons \nlearned and external assistance are in Appendix 5. \n \nd.  ADB Sector Strategy \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s strategy for developing the gas sector covers three main areas. The first is \nimproved  commercialization  including  PSP,  continuous  progress  in  sector  reforms,  and \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Energy Sector. Manila. \n12  ADB. 2003. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation of Asian Development Bank Assistance to Bangladesh Power \nSector. Manila. \n ", "7 \nunbundling of sector activities. Critical to this effort is the autonomy of the sector operations \nfrom the social obligations of the Government. Sector and enterprise, level governance is also a \nkey issue of ADB\u2019s strategy. Second is the increased access to natural gas at affordable prices \nacross the country. Nonavailability of energy is a major constraint to the development of the \neconomy. Hence, efforts to increase energy coverage for the population must be accelerated so \nas to reduce the disparity in development between eastern and western regions. With the \ncommissioning  of  the  Jamuna  Bridge  and  the  30-inch  gas  pipeline  across  it,  there  is  the \nopportunity to develop gas markets in the western areas.  \n \n22.  Environmental sustainability is the third pillar of ADB\u2019s strategy in the gas sector. Losses \nin distribution, especially to the commercial and domestic sectors, remain high. Leakage of \nnatural  gas  not  only  wastes  resources  but  also  pollutes  the  environment.  System  losses \njeopardize the financial health of the sector entities. Promoting CNG use for transport purposes, \nand reducing pollution in urban and industrial areas are also within ADB\u2019s sector strategy. \nADB\u2019s support for the proposed Project is considered crucial, for there is a need (i) to maintain \ncontinuous  policy  dialogue  on  the  implementation  of  the  GSRR;  and  (ii)  to  assure  good \npractices on safeguard issues such as the environment, resettlement, and other social matters. \nADB\u2019s involvement will also help increase the supply of natural gas to meet the growing energy \nneeds in less developed areas while improving the efficiency of gas production, transmission, \nand distribution companies.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The low utilization of natural gas in Bangladesh has constrained commercial, industrial, \nand rural development. To improve the situation, several major initiatives are being taken in the \ngas sector. Petrobangla\u2019s investment plan for oil, gas, and mineral resources for 2002\u20132020 is \none initiative. Another is the implementation of the GSRR. The GSRR covers (i) institutional and \nfinancial restructuring of gas sector companies to ensure long-term financial sustainability, (ii) \nrestructuring of gas sector entities, (iii) strengthening of public\u2013private participation aimed at \ncreating an environment for private sector-led growth, (iv) diversification of the ownership of gas \nsector  companies,  (v)  market-oriented  energy  pricing,  and  (vii)  promotion  of  sectoral  e-\ngovernance. The GSRR will be implemented in conjunction with the Project. \n \n24.  The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy emphasizes implementation of policies \ndirected toward expanding the natural gas grid to cover less developed areas, particularly in the \nwestern region of the country. The strategy will also accelerate balanced regional development \nthat would help reduce widespread poverty. The Project aims to further develop the main \nindigenous  energy  resource  in  Bangladesh  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  primary \ncommercial  energy.  It  will  increase  the  pace  of  economic  development  in  less  developed \nregions of the country by expanding the sustainable supply and use of natural gas to replace \npolluting fossil and biomass fuels. Use of natural gas will also improve indoor and outdoor air \nquality and reduce respiratory diseases. \n \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The project output is improved and expanded natural gas infrastructure and delivery \nsystem through an improved and expanded transmission and distribution network and field \nappraisal  support  for  gas  sector  companies.  The  Project  will  also  enhance  financial \nperformance,  governance,  and  efficiency  indicators  of  gas  sector  entities  through  capacity \n ", "8 \nbuilding and implementation of the GSRR. The Project will increase the pace of economic \ndevelopment in less developed regions of the country by expanding sustainable gas supply. \nWider use of natural gas resources to replace fossil and polluting biofuels will improve ambient \nair quality in urban centers as well as indoor air quality in many households. The Project and the \naffiliated GSRR will enhance the role of the private sector in natural gas-related activities, \nincluding (i) gas exploration and development; (ii) transmission and distribution; and (iii) gas \nmetering, audit, and operation and maintenance (O&M) activities. The private sector will also \nhave  an  enhanced  role  in  gas-based  or  related  industries,  power  generation,  and  other \nmanufacturing and processing activities.  \n \n26.  The  Project  will  have  three  investment  components\u2013gas  transmission  (five  sub-\ncomponents),  field  appraisal,  and  gas  distribution  network\u2013and  one  capacity-building \ncomponent. The specific activities of the Project are as follows: \n \n(i)  Part A. Gas transmission expansion and reinforcement. Five subcomponents \nwill transmit gas to the consumption centers including less developed regions of \nthe country.  \n \n(a)  Part A-1. Ashuganj-Manohardi-Dhanua-Elenga-Jamuna Bridge east \nbank  gas  transmission  pipeline  (AJGTP).  The  subcomponent  will \ninvolve the construction of a 30-inch-diameter, 51 km gas pipeline from \nManohardi through the Narsingdi, Ghazipur, and Tangail districts to the \neast  bank  of  the  Jamuna  bridge  (excluding  the  36  km  Ashuganj-\nManohardi section, which is under construction using Government funds \nand the existing 24-inch, 52 km Dhanua-Elenga section) and installation \nof compression facilities at Ashuganj (west) and Elenga with a throughput \nof 390 MMCFD. \n(b)  Part A-2. Hatikumrul-Ishwardi-Bheramara gas transmission pipeline \n(HBGTP). To expand the gas transmission network to the western region \nof the country, the subcomponent will involve the construction of a 24-\ninch-diameter, 87 km gas transmission pipeline from Hatikumrul about 14 \nkm from the Jamuna Bridge west to Bheramara through the Sirajganj, \nNatore, Pabna, and Kushtia districts to transmit 235 MMCFD of gas. (The \npipeline size may be increased to 30-inch-diameter during the detailed \ndesign stage if such change is proven prudent). \n \n(c)  Part  A-3.  Bonpara-Rajshahi  gas  transmission  pipeline  (BRGTP). \nConstruction of a 12-inch-diameter, 50 km gas transmission pipeline from \nBonpara to Rajshahi for transmitting 25 MMCFD. \n \n(d)  Part  A-4.  Bheramara-Khulna  gas  transmission  pipeline  (BKGTP). \nConstruction of a 20-inch-diameter, 165 km gas transmission pipeline \nfrom Bheramara to Khulna through Kushtia, Jessore, and Khulna districts, \nwith a capacity of 75\u2013125 MMCFD. \n \n(e)  Part  A-5.  North  south  system  expansion  (NSSE).  Installation  of \ncompressors at Ashuganj South and Muchai with throughputs ranging \nfrom 370 to 890 MMCFD. \n \n ", "9 \n(ii)  Part B. Field appraisal. Five producing gas fields will be appraised to upgrade \nthe estimated gas in place and also to determine the exact location for future \ndrilling activities. A three-dimensional (3-D) survey of the existing gas fields at \nRashidpur, Kailastila, and Sylhet in the northeast (owned by the SGFL, and Titas \nand Bakhrabad gas fields (owned by the BGFCL) in the east will be undertaken. \nNo new exploration activities will be involved.  \n \n(iii)  Part C. Rajshahi gas distribution network. Construction of a gas distribution \nnetwork  about  320  km  of  1-  to  8-inch-diameter  gas  distribution  pipelines  in \nRajshahi area. This network will subsequently be expanded to 350\u2013400 km. \n \n(iv)  Part  D.  Capacity  building.  Strengthen  the  policy-making  and  technical \ncapabilities of EMRD and assist gas sector institutions to undertake reform and \nrestructuring  while  ensuring  efficient  implementation  of  the  Project.  This \ncomponent  will  support  corporate  governance,  institutional  strengthening, \nfinancial management, operational improvement, human resource development \nand  technical  expertise  of  gas  companies  to  improve  sector  efficiency  and \nperformance. In particular, it will encourage private sector involvement in the gas \nsector though regulatory reforms. The gas system loss reduction plan will also be \nimplemented in part D. More details on the capacity building component are in \nSupplementary Appendix E.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n27.  Geographical  Focus.  The  project  scope  was  determined  on  the  basis  of  a \ncomprehensive  demand-supply  assessment,  including  regional  demand  analysis,  and \ntechnically full-fledged network analysis. The gas transmission component of the Project has \ntwo distinct parts: (i) the north-south system expansion (NSSE), designed to remove the supply \nbottlenecks  in  the  entire  network  including  the  existing  eastern  network;  and  (ii)  the  four \nextension pipelines, which will meet the projected demand in the less developed western region \nof the country. The western region has a weak industrial base, poor infrastructure, lower social \nindicators despite a rich agricultural base. The Project provides the opportunity for the first time \nin western part of Bangladesh to receive natural gas on a large scale to boost its economic \ndevelopment and alleviate regional disparities in the long run.  \n \n28.  Technology Transfer. Network analysis demonstrates the constraints in the existing \ngas supply system. Facilities that would help overcome these constraints include installation of \ncompressors at selected transmission points, and looping, depending on the growth in demand. \nThe existing network will not be able to meet the demand beyond 2007, when demand would \npeak  at  1,796  MMCFD.  To  address  this  constraint,  the  NSSE  involves  installation  of \ncompression facilities at Muchai and Ashuganj south, together with the recently commissioned \nRashidpur-Habiganj  loop,  to  augment  the  throughput  from  650  MMCFD  in  2004  to  1,564 \nMMCFD in 2009. The Project supports the use of compressors in the gas sector for the first time \nin  the  country  and  promotes  state-of-the  art  technology  transfer.    The  newly  introduced \ninnovative  technology  will  continue  to  help  the  gas  sector  of  the  country.  An  additional \ncompressor  facility  at  Ashuganj  west  will  be installed  to  maintain  the  supply  to  the  major \nconsumption centers in the eastern regions. An additional loop line and compressor at Elenga \nwill be installed to ensure an adequate supply to the western region, with or without the three \nextensions to Bheramara, Rajshahi, and Khulna.  \n \n ", "10 \n29.  Sector Governance.  Sector-level governance issues focus on sector reforms, tariff \ndetermination, setting up a regulator and defining its functions, and sustainability of energy \nsector operations. These are addressed by streamlining the approval process and implementing \nthe energy policy and Gas Act, and (iii) preparing the GSRR. Implementation of GSRR is key in \nresolving many enterprise-level governance problems. Under the GSRR, several gas sector \nenterprises  are  required  to  undergo  restructuring  and  establish  accounting  and  business \nautonomy. The entities will be accountable for their finances as well as their decision-making \nprocess.  The  gas  sector  entities  will  also  implement  the  gas  system  loss  reduction  plan \n(GSLRP) where gas theft and malpractices in meter reading will become illegal. The Project and \nthe affiliated GSRR will enhance the role of the private sector in the gas sector. The private \nsector will have an enhanced role in gas-based or -related industries, power generation, and \nother manufacturing and processing activities.   \n \n30.  Air Quality Improvement. The Project will support the use of natural gas, which is a \nmuch cleaner fuel, for power generation, and industrial and transport purposes. Making gas \nwidely available, it will also promote use of a cleaner fuel in households in place of more \npolluting crop residues or animal waste. The Project will also support the implementation of the \nGSLRP, a nationwide plan that Petrobangla will implement. The GSLRP will help reduce gas \nsystem losses to 2% by 2010. Wider use of natural gas will improve ambient air quality in urban \ncenters and indoor air quality in households. Beside on-site economic, environmental, and \nhealth  benefits,  the  expected  global  environmental,  and  benefits  associated  with  reduced \ngreenhouse gas will also be significant.   \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n31.  The total project cost is estimated at $413 million equivalent comprising $235 million in \nforeign exchange, and $178 million equivalent in local currency. The cost includes physical and \nprice  contingencies,  and  financing  charges  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nprocedures. The cost estimates by component and subproject are summarized in Table 1; \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6.   \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n32.  A loan of $225 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR loan) will finance the \ninvestment components (parts A, B, C, and D.2) and will have a 20-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based varying lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75%,13 and the \nusual conversion options, and other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project \nagreements (in amounts as indicated in Table 1) under subsidiary loan agreements, with terms \nand conditions acceptable to ADB. The OCR loan will be re-lent to the executing agencies (EAs) \nin local currency at a rate of 5% for a period of 15 years inclusive of a grace period of 5 years. \nThe foreign exchange risk of the loan will be assumed by the EAs during the life of the \nrespective subsidiary loans, and thereafter by the Borrower. The EAs have the capacity to \nmanage  the  foreign  exchange  risk,  as  their  revenues  are  adjusted  to  foreign  exchange \nvariations. The Government will provide the local currency cost of $178 million through loan and \nequity contributions. The financing plan is in Table 2. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \n                                                 \n13 If the loan is approved by the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors before March 2006, no front-end fee, usually charged at 1% \non OCR loans, will be applicable.  \n ", "11 \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication of advice from ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  Part A will be executed by the Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL); part B by \nSylhet  Gas  Fields  Limited  (SGFL)  and  Bakhrabad  Gas  Systems  Limited  (BGFCL),  with \nBangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company Limited (BAPEX) as Implementing Agency (IA); \npart C by Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL); and part D (including the Norwegian \ngrant GSLRP) by Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Minerals Corporation (Petrobangla) in coordination \nwith  EMRD  and  the  concerned  entities.  The  day-to-day  project  implementation  will  be \nundertaken/supervised  by  the  project  management  units  (PMU)  set  up  specifically  for  the \nProject  by  the  EAs  and  headed  by  senior  officers.  Petrobangla  will  establish  a  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) to coordinate all project-related matters in association with PMUs. The \nexisting  steering  committee  in  EMRD,  which  monitors  and  supervises  all  foreign-funded \nprojects,  will  also  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project.  PMUs  have  already  started  their \noperations with sufficient number of staff on a full-time basis, and steps are under way to \nconstitute  the  PMUs.  The  Project  will  be  completed  in  5  years.  It  is  envisaged  that \nimplementation will begin in early 2006, and the last subcomponent will be completed in mid-\n2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n1.  Procurement \n35.  The equipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loans \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement on the basis of either \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) or international shopping (IS), depending on the contract \nsize. Procurement will be carried out separately for each part of the Project by the concerned \nEA/IA. Each supply contract, estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more, will be \nawarded on the basis of ICB.  Each supply contract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of \n$500,000  can  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping  (IS).  Turnkey  contracts \nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB, and \nturnkey contracts with an estimated cost of less than $500,000 can be awarded on the basis of \nIS. A tentative procurement package has been prepared and will be finalized after detailed \ndesign has been completed (Appendix 8). ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents will be used in \nprocuring  ADB-financed  goods  and  services.  The  Government  is  aware  that  that  ADB \nManagement has authorized advance action but without any commitment to financing this \nProject. With ADB\u2019s support, GTCL has initiated recruitment of consultants to prepare bidding \ndocuments  for  the  compressor  stations.  Petrobangla  has  developed  a  website \n(http://www.petrobangla.org.bd/GTDP) to facilitate more efficient e-procurement where ADB will \nhave common access to review the draft bidding documents on-line. \n \n2.  Consulting Services  \n36.  All consultants will be engaged by the EAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used. Consultants will be \nengaged as a firm or on an individual basis, as necessary. Consulting services will be required \nfor (i) project implementation support in the installation of compressors and the Supervisory \nControl and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system; (ii) support for 3-D field survey in part B; and (iii) \ncapacity building and training of relevant gas sector entities in part D. Part C will not require any \nconsulting services. The Project will require a total of 262 person-months of international and \n305 person-months of domestic consulting services. The EAs will be allowed to initiate advance \nrecruitment action, which however, will not commit ADB to approve the Project or to finance the \n ", "13 \nrecruitment costs. Appendix 9 gives an outline of the terms of reference (TOR) for consulting \nservices expected under the Project. The more detailed TOR is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n3.  Disbursement Arrangements \n37.  Disbursement  of  loan  funds  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Disbursement. ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be \nutilized.  Disbursement  for  part  B  will  be  allowed  after  submission  to  ADB  of  the  signed \nagreement  on  implementing  arrangements  between  BGFCL,  SGFCL,  and  BAPEX. \nDisbursement for the BKGTP subcomponent (part A4) will be allowed only after the EA has \ncomplied with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements relative to a resettlement plan (RP).  \n \n4.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n38.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. The \nEAs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project  components.  Independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts and related financial statements annually. \nCertified copies of such audited accounts and financial statements of each EA in English will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the financial year to which they relate. \nThe annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the other expenditure \nprocedures. All EAs were informed about ADB's policy on submission of audited financial \nstatements and possible penalties for delayed submission. The PMUs will submit to ADB (i) \nquarterly progress reports on project implementation, (ii) annual reports, and (iii) a project \ncompletion report no later than 3 months after project completion.  \n \n5.  Project Review, Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n39.  A project performance monitoring system will be established to assess progress and \nimplementation of the Project and to measure impacts and outcomes. A set of indicators for \nevaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, outputs, and conditions will be \ndeveloped. A report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 \nyears later will be submitted. ADB will monitor implementation of all components of the Project \nthrough quarterly progress reports. In addition to the normal periodic reviews, ADB and the \nGovernment will undertake a midterm review 2 years after project implementation begins. The \nmidterm  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, consultation with affected persons, and achievement of scheduled \ntargets, progress on policy reforms, and capacity-building measures. \n \n6.  Governance and Corruption \n40.  ADB has been addressing governance constraints in both core and sectoral areas in \nBangladesh.  ADB  was  also  at  the  forefront  in  extending  support  to  the  Government  for \nestablishing  an  independent  Anti-Corruption  Commission  in  the  country.  At  the  end  of \nNovember 2004, the Government established the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) following \nlegislation passed in February 2004. Now through its core governance intervention in the form \nof the TA supporting good governance initiatives, ADB is working for operationalization of ACC \nto foster an independent mechanism for anticorruption and development of a national integrity \nstrategy  to  provide  a  strategic  policy  framework  for  anticorruption  in  Bangladesh.  Public \nprocurement,  which  is  an  area  generally  associated  with  a  high  level  of  corruption,  is \nundergoing a major reform program supported by ADB, World Bank, and other development \n ", "14 \npartners following the new public procurement regulations that became effective in October \n2003.  The  proposed  Project  also  incorporates  several  specific  anticorruption  measures, \nincluding  (i)  strict  financial  management  with  strengthened  Government  monitoring  and \nindependent monitoring, (ii) strong project supervision with appropriate consultancy input, (iii) \nregular independent performance auditing to monitor project implementation, and (iv) random \nand independent spot checks. \n \n7.  Executing and Implementing Agencies \n41.  The EAs and IAs form part of the Petrobangla group of companies, incorporated under \nthe Companies\u2019 Act. The organization structure of the SGCs involved in the Project is similar. \nEach EA and IA is managed by a board of directors, representing the Government, Petrobangla, \nand external institutions and individuals. Each is headed by a managing director reporting to the \nboard, and assisted by a number of senior managers for operation, planning and finance, as \nwell as construction and other technical matters.  \n \n42.  Pursuant to a loan covenant under ADB\u2019s Dhaka Clean Fuel Project in each SGC, three \ntop executives responsible for management, operation, and finance, particularly for GTCL, are \nappointed through competitive selection. Most of the higher level operational and management \nstaff have university degrees and most technicians have attended technical schools. The SGCs \nhave  operational  autonomy  in  managing  their  affairs  under  the  direction  of  the  respective \nboards.  However,  technical  and management  training  is  needed  to  upgrade  the  technical, \nfinancial, and management expertise and to enable managers to adapt to a changing business \nenvironment. Under the Project, selected personnel of the SGCs will undergo human resource \ndevelopment and international training in financial management, operation and maintenance of \nnew facilities, and efficient use of new technologies.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Technical Aspects \n43.  The total present gas demand in the country is about 1,350 MMCFD. Government \nestimates show that this will increase to 2,420 MMCFD in 2015 and 3,785 MMCFD in 2025. If \nthis trend persists, Bangladesh will require 105 MMCFD in 2018 and 4.47 TCF additional gas by \n2025 from new discoveries to meet its commercial energy demand. All technical exploratory \nstudies indicate that Bangladesh has adequate gas reserves to meet its requirements.  \n \n44.  Network analysis demonstrates the constraints in the existing gas supply system. The \nleast-cost  analysis  shows  that  overcoming  those  constraints  will  involve  installation  of \ncompressors at selected transmission points, and looping, depending on the growth in demand. \nThe existing network will not be able to meet the demand level beyond 2007, when the peak \ndemand would be 1,796 MMCFD. To address these constraints, the NSSE involves installation \nof  compression  facilities  at  Muchai  and  Ashuganj  South.  These  together  with  the  recently \ncommissioned Rashidpur-Habiganj loop will augment the throughput of 1,564 MMCFD in 2009. \nAdditional compressor facility at Ashuganj west will have to be installed to maintain the supply to \nthe major consumption centers in the eastern regions. An additional loop line and compressor at \nElenga will be installed to allow an adequate supply to the western region, with or without \nextensions to Bheramara, Rajshahi, and Khulna. Such improvements will enable the present \nproject design to serve for the natural gas system for the next 25 years or more. \n ", "15 \nB.  Financial Viability \n45.  Financial evaluation of the Project was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for \nthe Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. The analysis and computation of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), \nincluding sensitivity analysis, were carried out for the (i) pipeline extensions, (ii) existing system \nreinforcement,  and  (iii)  overall  system  including  expansions  and  extensions.  For  the  field \nappraisal component, no FIRR was calculated since there is no revenue stream associated with \nthis component and the investment provides a clearer delineation and an increase in reserves \nthat have future economic benefit. Financial analysis was undertaken in real terms using 2005 \nprices. The without-project and with-project scenarios were compared.  Without the project, the \nongoing gas shortages in Bangladesh, with frequent power brownouts, would continue. With the \nproject, the available gas supply northeast of Bangladesh from newly discovered fields that are \nbeing developed would be available to meet shortages in the existing gas supply area and also \nto supply the new market areas on the west side of the Jamuna bridge. A summary of the past \nand projected financial performance of the EAs is attached as Appendix 10. More details on \nfinancial management are given in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n46.  The overall pipeline and compressor option combined with the extension projects has a \nFIRR of 12.0% computed on an after-tax basis. This FIRR compares favorably with the WACC \nof 3.79%, also computed after tax. Sensitivity analysis was run for increases (+10%) in capital \nand operating and maintenance costs, and a reduction in project benefits (-10%). A combination \nof the increases in costs and decreases in benefits was also tested, together with project delays \naccompanied by increases in project costs. In addition a number of specific sensitivities were \nalso analyzed: (i) reduction in wheeling charges to Tk 0.36/thousand cubic feet (MCF) by 15%, \nimplying only half real increases prior to July 2008; (ii) increase in compressor fuel consumption \nfrom 1.5% to 2.5% of gas volumes; (iii) increase in compressor fuel costs from current average \ncosts of $0.55/MCF to $1.32/MCF; (iv) reduction in salvage value of pipelines by 50%, reflecting \na 25-year rather than 40-year life; and (v) a 2-year delay in construction and a 20% increase in \noverall  project  costs. Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  suggests  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under \nadverse conditions. Therefore, the Project is considered financially viable. A summary of the \nProject\u2019s financial evaluations is given in Appendix 11 and a more detailed analysis is in the \nSupplementary Appendix H.  \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n47.  Demand Analysis. Future gas demand was analyzed for the area covered by the \nexisting pipeline system and for three possible west zone pipeline expansion projects. The \nforecast gas sales level for the existing network area was the basis for estimating increased \nvolumes and benefits from network expansion. The analysis assumed that the present network \nsystem would not meet demand above the 2007 level, and that increased gas sales above at \nlevel would be due entirely to investment in the network. The capital and operating costs of the \nmain transmission system project investments were allocated among the subprojects on the \nbasis of future gas sales over the evaluation period, with sales held constant from 2017 to 2027. \nMost of the existing system and extensions were expected to be at capacity by 2017. The \nexpected increase in gas consumption over the next 22 years (with consumption constant from \n2017) would be 8.5 million MMCF. Of this, 80% is related to growth within the existing network \nand 20% from the proposed extensions (Appendix 12). \n \n48.  Least-Cost Analysis. The network analysis has been validated for the entire system, \nand changing any one element may affect the entire system. However, between any two points, \n ", "16 \ncompressors or looping alternatives can be compared. The planned investment program is \nbased on numerous simulation runs to identify the locations where bottlenecks develop as \nthroughput increases and to remove those bottlenecks with compressors or looping. For all \ncompressor locations identified as bottlenecks, costs of the pipeline looping alternative were \nestimated. Capital costs differenced by about $189 million between the two proposals in favor of \ncompressors. The operating and maintenance (O&M) costs per year for pipe and compressors \nare typically about 1% and 2.5% of the installed costs, respectively. The various pipeline size \noptions for the extensions on the west side of the Jamuna Bridge, based on demand forecasts \nwere also evaluated. The length of the extensions and pressure regime on the main line and \neconomies  of  scale  on  compressor  utilization  resulted  in  the  least-cost  solution  for  the \nextensions at $169.2 million compared with the option ($253.7 million) originally proposed by \nGTCL. Details are given in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n49.   Economic Rate of Return. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated \nfor the Project to assess its economic viability. The costs considered were capital costs, and \nO&M costs. Appropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial values into economic \nvalues. Values are expressed in 2005 prices. The main economic benefit of the Project is the \nvalue of future imported petroleum fuels and indigenous energy sources that gas would displace \nwith the extension of the transmission pipeline into the less developed areas of the country, and \ngrowth in demand from new and existing customers in the existing gas supply area. The EIRR \nwas computed at 28.1% for the Project (Appendix 12). Sensitivity and risk analyses simulating \nadverse  scenarios  showed  the  project  EIRR  to  be  stable  and  robust.  More  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix J.  \n \nD.  Social Assessment \n \n1.  Poverty Assessment  \n50.  The Project will have a poverty reduction impact in the project areas. The positive effects \nare  expected  to  be  multidimensional.  Poverty  analysis  was  carried  out  during  the  project \npreparatory phase. Details of the stakeholder consultation are in Supplementary Appendix K. \nThe levels of income are likely to increase due to new opportunities that are expected to open \nup, and the increased employment opportunities due to economic diversification. The channels \nthrough which the income of the poor would increase are (i) expansion in nonfarm economic \nactivities; (ii) growth in agricultural income, mainly due to access to cheaper fertilizers and \nirrigation costs; (iii) changes in markets and the land tenure system; (iv) expansion of markets \nand institutions due to availability of gas and electricity; (v) time saved that could be devoted to \nother pursuits, particularly for women, who would be involved in extra economic activities; and \n(vi) low cost of natural gas compared with other sources of energy. Nonincome poverty can be \nreduced by (i) controlling depletion of forest resources and reducing health risk and diseases; \n(ii) empowering women through new income opportunities; (iii) establishing social infrastructure \nthat  would  provide  better  services  (e.g.,  health  centers,  educational  institutions);  and  (iv) \nbuilding social relations and status, etc. Moreover, the Project will create about 3,000 person-\nmonths of job opportunities for the unskilled labor category. A summary of the poverty and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. More details are given in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n2.  Resettlement  \n51.  Field studies were carried out to assess the exact situation of persons likely to be \naffected by the Project. Part A will involve mostly strip acquisition, and impacts are expected to \nbe both temporary and permanent, though not extensive (alignment corridor will require 8 \n ", "17 \nmeters of permanent and 15 meters of temporary land acquisition). The corridor will mainly pass \nthrough cultivated land. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts would be minimized by \naligning the pipelines away from areas with high population density. Total land acquisition for \ngas pipes alignment is 159 hectares (ha) on a permanent basis and 336 ha on a temporary \nbasis.14 Although little displacement is required, the EAs have prepared resettlement plans \n(RPs) for all project components. A total of 64 families will lose their homestead. For part B, the \nfield appraisal component, land acquisition of 270 ha will only be on a temporary basis. For part \nC,  the  distribution  component,  no  land  is  expected  to  be  acquired  from  private  owners. \nNevertheless, given the high population density, an assessment of all affected persons (APs), \ntitled  and  nontitled,  was  carried  out.  No  resettlement  issues  were  found.  The  summary \nresettlement plan is in Appendix 14. Details on the summary RP are given in Supplementary \nAppendix M. The full RPs by project components are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n52.  The EAs have been disclosing RP-related information to APs on a continuous basis \nthrough various means including pamphlets, brochures, and newspapers in the local language. \nAll  RPs  were  submitted  to  ADB  on  2  April  2005,  except  that  for  the  Bheramara-Khulna \nsubcomponent.  ADB  reviewed  the  RPs.  The  Government  assured  the  ADB  Mission  that \ncompensation to all APs will be paid according to ADB\u2019s guidelines and the Acquisition and \nRequisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982 and subsequent amendments to it. The \nRP for the Bheramara-Khulna subcomponent (Part A4) will be prepared upon finalization of the \npipeline route, detailed survey for which is under way. GTCL will submit the draft RP to ADB by \n31 December 2005 according to the resettlement framework (RF), which was submitted by the \nGovernment on 8 April 2005. No disbursement for the subcomponent will be allowed prior to \nmeeting the requirements.  \n \nE.  Environmental Analysis \n \n53.  The  EAs  have  prepared  initial  the  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  the \ncomponents. The IEEs analyzed data collected through reviews of available reports, maps, \ndiscussions with stakeholders, and field visits to the project areas. The IEEs were prepared \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  impact \nassessment guidelines for industries, and related national policies and legislation. The lEEs are \ndetailed and well prepared. They identify the potential impacts, their severity, and duration. The \nIEEs also provide mitigating measures for the impacts and a monitoring plan. The IEEs show \nthat the proposed Project will be passing through farmlands, rural areas, peri-urban areas, and \nsecondary cities. It will not pass through any socially, archeologically, or ecologically sensitive \nareas. In addition, potential impacts will mostly be temporary and will not have lasting impacts if \nmitigating measures outlined in the environmental management plan are followed. A summary \nIEE for the entire Project highlighting the findings of IEEs has been found acceptable by ADB \n(Appendix 15). Based on the IEEs, the Project is in environment category B. Therefore, a full \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  will  not  be  required.  More  detailed  IEEs  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix O.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 Permanent land acquisition will be 46, 72, and 41 ha for Monohardi-Jamuna Bridge East Bank, Nalka-Bheramara, \nand Bonpara-Rajshahi, respectively. Temporary land acquisition will be 130, 131, and 75 ha for Monohardi-Jamuna \nBridge East Bank, Nalka-Bheramara, and Bonpara-Rajshahi, respectively. No land acquisition from private owners \nis expected for compression stations. \n ", "18 \nF.  Risks \n \n54.  Project  components  are  not  subject  to  any  unusual  technical  or  commercial  risks. \nTechnical  design  has  included  adequate  precautions  such  as  concrete  lining  and \nreinforcements. Assurance for counterpart funding arrangement ensures the availability of local \ncurrency. Participating companies will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan. The gas \ncompanies  (GTCL,  TGTDCL,  BGFCL,  and  SGFL)  have  the  capacity  to  manage  foreign \nexchange risks, as their revenues are adjusted to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The \npotential policy risk relates to the failure or delay in implementing the required reform and \nrestructuring measures. Continued policy dialogue with the Government on the agreed-upon \ntime frame to implement the GSRR would alleviate this risk. Another concern is the availability \nof the required gas supply during the Project\u2019s economic life. Bangladesh\u2019s exploration-to-\ndiscovery ratio is significantly high. With adequate investments, such a risk can be mitigated. \nFurthermore, the Government has agreed to encourage and accelerate exploration activities in \nboth public and private sectors to ensure timely reserve replacement and gas availability. This is \na loan assurance in implementing the GSRR. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n55.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  implement  the  GSRR  in  accordance  with  the  outlined \nschedule, will consult ADB before making any adjustments, and will keep ADB \ninformed of its action program for natural gas exploration and development, and \nmajor investment programs; by 30 June 2006 draft Gas Act and revised Energy \nPolicy  will  be  submitted  to  the  Parliament  and  Government  for  approval, \naccordingly. \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that, by 31 December 2005, tariff determination at \nthe end user level will be transferred to ERC, according to Chapter 7, Section 34 \n(1) Tariff of the ERC Act 2003, and gas tariffs for gas transmission, operation, \nand distribution companies are set at an adequate level to cover operating costs, \nmaintenance and depreciation, and financing costs. \n \n(iii)  Consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate directly, or through its agents, \nany possible financial or management impropriety in conducting the Project.

Total proven and probable recoverable gas reserves from 22 fields in Bangladesh are \nestimated at 20.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 5.09 TCF has so far been consumed. The \ncurrent net recoverable reserves stand at 15.3 TCF. Of the 22 gas fields, 20 have so far been \nbrought under production. Fourteen of them are currently under production, and six are not \nproducing at this time. A recent study conducted by the Hydrocarbon Unit in cooperation with \nthe  Norwegian  Petroleum  Directorate  has  estimated  Bangladesh\u2019s  remaining  recoverable \nproven and probable gas reserves at just over 16 TCF. 15 The study concludes that, taking the \ndiscovered and undiscovered reserves together, there is a 90% probability that Bangladesh\u2019s \ngas resource will exceed 30 TCF. Some estimates indicate an undiscovered potential of up to \n88 TCF,16 about 5.5 times the reserves of 15.9 TCF proven and probable recoverable gas \ndiscovered to date that has been in production. \n2.  A study17 in 2001 presents a base case with a growth rate of 4.7% between 2004 and \n2020, a high growth rate case of 6.5% and a low growth rate case of 3.4%. The forecast \ndemand for 2020 corresponding to these assumed growth rates has a plus 38% minus 33% \nrange around the base case. The difference between the high and low cases represents the \ndemand of 1,692 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD), which is greater than the total present \ndemand of 1,240 MMCFD. Gas consumption in Bangladesh in the last decade rose from 172.7 \nbillion cubic feet (BCF) to 331.2 BCF at an annual growth rate of 7%. However, in 2000\u20132004, \ngas consumption increased at an annual growth of 8%. Average consumption in the different \nsectors was 8% for power (from 399 MMCFD to 544.4 MMCFD), 2% for fertilizer (from 232.6 \nMMCFD to 254.3 MMCFD), and 13% for all the nonbulk sectors (from 278.2 MMCFD to 448.4 \nMMCFD). In the nonbulk sectors, captive power has marked the highest growth of 33% (27.3 \nMMCFD to 84.5MMCFD) followed by domestic use of 13% (81.3 MMCFD to 134.9 MMCFD), \nindustry 10% (98.3 to 141.3MMCFD), and commercial use 6% etc. \n \n3.  The forecast balance between peak gas demand and peak gas supply indicates that the \ncurrent deficit of 103\u2013200 MMCFD will change to a surplus of about 200 MMCFD during 2007\u2013\n2010. This will, however, change to a deficit of increasing size after 2013. If no new reserves \nare added to the existing ones, the country will encounter a net deficit of about 249 MMCFD in \n2016, which will rise sharply to 4,421 MMCFD by 2025. About 23.225 TCF gas would be \nrequired to meet the gas demand (high case scenario) over the projection period, of which \n14.871 TCF would be met from the existing reserve and 8.354 TCF would be required to be \nreplenished through new discoveries or from alternative sources. All technical assessments \nindicate that new reserves could be discovered with adequate investments. \n \n4.  The  scale  of  the  required  investments  implies  that  the  private  sector  can  have  a \nsignificant  role  in  the  gas  sector  provided  that  the  right  incentives  are  made  available  to \ninvestors. After discussions with the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \ntechnical assistance (TA)18 to assist the Government in promoting private sector participation \nand assuring sustainable development in the gas sector. A detailed examination of sectoral \nstructure, unbundling of transmission and distribution companies, and investment planning will \nbe undertaken to meet the reform objectives and to facilitate greater private sector participation \nin the gas sector. TA implementation will start soon.   \n                                                 \n15  Hydrocarbon Unit. 2001. Bangladesh Petroleum and Resource Assessment.

The Third Natural Gas Development Project19 financed by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in 1993 required that the system loss of gas distribution companies be reduced from \nabout  8\u20139%  in  1992/93  to  less  than  2%  by  30  June  1995.  Two  distribution  companies, \nBakhrabad Gas Systems Limited and Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution Systems \nLimited  (JGTDSL),  managed  to  bring  down  system  loss  to  the  desired  level.  The  largest \ndistribution company, Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL), \nimplemented two time-bound action programs, one in 1993 and another in 2001, for reducing \nsystem loss to a level of 2% by June 2005.  \n \n2.  Both programs were unsuccessful in meeting the objectives. During the last 5 years \n(1999\u20132004), the overall system loss of gas companies ranged from 4.47% to 6.49%. During \nthe same period, system losses for the nonbulk sector (mostly from distribution) ranged from \n13.6% to 23.23%. The nonbulk sector accounts for about 18% of total gas consumption in the \ncountry. Transmission subsector gas system losses are about 1% and proper management of \nthe nonbulk subsector is the key to gas system loss reduction in the country. Taking into \naccount the lessons learned, a comprehensive gas system loss reduction plan (GSLRP) was \ndeveloped  for  implementation  in  conjunction  with  the  Gas  Transmission  and  Development \nProject. The goal of GSLRP is to reduce system loss to less than 2% by 2010. The plan will be \nin place by 2007. The key measures in the GSLRP are summarized in Table A3.

External Assistance \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been involved in the gas sector intermittently \nover the last 30 years and provided eight loans totaling $446 million. The role of ADB has \nevolved from provider of funds for individual products to a more proactive one that is more \ncomprehensive, involving technical advice for project preparation (since the 1980s) and policy \nadvice in implementing sector reforms (since the 1990s). ADB has also given 16 technical \nassistance (TA) grants worth $4.9 million for improving operational efficiencies, preparing a gas \nmaster plan, drafting a gas law, developing a policy on private sector participation (PSP) in gas \npipeline construction evaluating options for PSP in the Rashidpur-Ashuganj gas pipeline, and \nexamination of personnel-related issues in the sector. Development of the downstream market \nin promoting the use of natural gas for the transport sector has also been supported through the \nDhaka Clean Fuel Project.20  \n \n2.  The World Bank entered the sector in 1980, and during 1980\u20131995, provided four loans \ntotaling $344 million. World Bank support was extended for developing transmission systems, \ndeveloping gas fields, and preparing a package for attracting PSP in oil and gas exploration. \nWorld  Bank  also  supported  Petrobangla  and  gas  sector  entities  in  developing  financial \nmanagement and a management information system. It is currently supporting Petrobangla in \npreparing a gas sector master plan. Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Netherlands, and United \nKingdom also supported the sector intermittently in exploration, production, transmission, and \ndistribution. In addition to ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Authority (JICA) and US \nTrade Development Agency (USTDA) have supported studies on optimization of gas use; the \nNorwegian Agency for Development is assisting in establishing and supporting the hydrocarbon \nunit (HCU), a think tank for policy advice within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n(MEMR);  and  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  has  supported  the \nintroduction of vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG). External assistance to the gas \nsector from ADB and other sources such as the World Bank, Japan, and the United Kingdom \nfrom 1993 to 2002 are in Table A5. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n \n3.  Since Bangladesh joined ADB in 1973, its power sector has received 18 public sector \nloans and one private sector investment totaling about $1.4 billion, and 20 TA grants totaling \nabout  $9.6  million  from  ADB.  ADB  recently  evaluated  its  power  assistance  program21  in \nBangladesh and several key lessons were drawn. At the project level, there is a need to (i) \nminimize delays in public sector project implementation; (ii) improve local capacities in project \npreparation, implementation, and operation and selection of appropriate technology; (iii) improve \nownership of TAs; and (iv) improve financial management capacities. \n \n4.  At the strategic level, first, ADB\u2019s approach to sector reform, which is based on piloting \nchange and learning by doing, succeeded in facilitating change. With the success of individual \nprojects and newly created entities, the approach clearly demonstrates the direction that future \nreforms should take. Second, the pace of privatization in an environment such as that in \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2002.

Recent  achievements  to  improve  sector  efficiency  with  ADB  support  include  (i) \nenactment of legislation to establish an independent regulatory body to regulate the unbundled \npower and gas sectors; (ii) corporatization of power sector entities; (iii) allowing full autonomy to \nkey  gas  sector  entities;  (iv)  adoption  of  a  pricing  framework  for  oil  and  gas,  and  tariff \nrationalization for power and gas; and (v) the Government\u2019s recent decision to privatize the \nmarketing of petroleum products and induct the private sector into the business of power \ngeneration, oil and gas exploration, and CNG. Poverty reduction being ADB\u2019s overarching \ndevelopment goal, improving the poor\u2019s access to natural gas would be supported. Optimization \nof use, reducing waste of gas in all segments of the sector, and appropriate tariffs would be \nsupported  to  ensure  distribution  of  the  benefits  of  development.  Improving  corporate \ngovernance in the sector would be crucial in implementing the Government\u2019s Interim Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper. Critical to this effort is the autonomy of the operations of the sector, \nprotecting the managements of sector entities from government interference. Restructuring of \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \n  \n \nsector entities would be pursued. In tandem, efforts for increasing PSP in the sector would be \nstrengthened. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s Country Assistance Program Evaluation22 notes that, as the lead funding agency \nin the energy sector, ADB has had a central role in promoting institutional reform to enhance the \ncost-effectiveness of sector operations, and allow greater PSP. This approach has led ADB to \npursue a strategy of continued investment combined with pressure to reform, through both loan \ncovenants  and  extended  policy  dialogue.  One  result  has  been  long  delays  in  project \nimplementation in both the power and the gas sectors. Despite early corporatization, adoption of \ncommercial management practices has also been slow in the gas sector.  \n \n7.  In the past, ADB implemented the following loan projects; Natural Gas Development \nProject23 , Second Natural Gas Development Project24 and Greater Dhaka Gas Distribution \nProject.25 All three projects were rated generally successful. The key lessons learned from \nimplementing these projects are the need (i) at project preparation to pay more attention to \ntechnical risks and engineering evaluations associated with well development; (ii) at project \ndesign  to  implement  procedures  for  fast-tracking,  thus  avoiding  unnecessary  delays  in \nprocessing and administration of contracts and the timely availability of Government funding; \nand (iii) at implementation to ensure that transmission, treatment, and processing designs do \nnot limit flexibility of operations, and/or reservoir management practices. Reflecting the current \noperational  status  of  executing  agencies  (EAs),  a  continuing  need  exists  to  (i)  pay  more \nattention to improving the flexibility of sourcing gas supplies from different fields by unifying the \nmanagement of transmission operations; (ii) improve institutional efficiency by strengthening \nmonitoring capabilities at the different functional operations for well development, transmission, \nand  distribution;  (iii)  reduce  system  losses  at  distribution;  and  (iv)  enhance  the  financial \nperformance of EAs through increasing end-user tariffs.  \n \n8.  Of  two  recent  loans,  the  Third  Natural  Gas  Development  Project  (TNGDP)  was \ncompleted in October 2003, more than 4 years behind schedule due to procurement delays. \nThe Dhaka Clean Fuel Project (footnote 1) was declared effective 1 year after loan approval. \nSeveral major initiatives were, however, taken under the TNGDP. These are (i) allowing full \nautonomy to gas sector entities; (ii) reduction of system losses through various measures, \nincluding introduction of meters for domestic consumers; (iii) rationalization of the gas tariff, \naligning  it  with  international  fuel  oil  price;  (iv)  introduction  of  gas  legislation;  (v)  eventual \nprivatization of gas sector entities by initiating off-loading of shares; and (vi) establishment of the \nHydrocarbon Unit. Revision of the gas tariff four times during 1998\u20132000 and adoption in \nOctober 2003 after project completion of a gas-pricing framework linked to international fuel oil \nprices could be considered largely in compliance with the related covenant of TNGDP. Other \nmajor policy covenants, particularly those relating to autonomy to gas sector entities, have been \nsubstantially  complied  with.  Gas  sector  entities  are  now  enjoying  full  financial  powers  in \ndeciding on procurement cases. These policy measures will be further pursued under the Dhaka \nClean Fuel Project and the proposed Gas Transmission and Development Project.  \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2003.

Past Financial Performance \n1.  Petrobangla obtains the bulk of its revenues from a management service charge levied \non state-owned gas companies (SGCs). It also earns interest income, which is used to offset \nany operating deficit so that, in recent years up to 2003, it had shown a net surplus on its \nactivities. In 2004, operating cost increases resulted in a higher operating loss, which was not \noffset by interest income. The result was a deficit of Tk7.5 million compared with a net surplus in \n2003 of Tk0.3 million. Higher payments to international oil companies (IOCs) compared with \nreceipts from overall gas sales increased the price deficit and eroded Petrobangla\u2019s balance \nsheet. As a result, payments to IOCs are delayed as Petrobangla does not have the cash to \nmeet payments. Thus, by the end of 2003, the cumulative deficit of payments to IOCs above the \nPrice Deficit Fund was Tk4,835 million. In 2004, however, the cumulative deficit was sharply \nreduced as a result of a small surplus on production sharing contract (PSC) operations, so that \nthe cumulative deficit stood at Tk845 million on 30 June 2004. Table A10.1 is a summary of the \nfinancial performance of SGCs. \n \n2.  The gas transported by Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) doubled from 3,262  \nmillion  cubic  meter  (MMm3)  in  1999  to  6,603  MMm3  by  2004.  The  gas  wheeling  charge \nremained at Tk0.22/cubic meter (m3) from 1999 to January 2002, and then at Tk0.25 until June \n2004. Thus, GTCL\u2019s increased revenues had been due mainly to increases in volumes, with net \nrevenues also growing by approximately 20% per annum, and net profit reaching Tk424 million \nin 2004. Since July 2004 the wheeling charge has increased in two steps to Tk0.36/ m3.  Return \non net fixed assets (RNFA) reached 6.1% in 2004 and is projected at 6.1% in 2005. Thus, \nalthough GTCL\u2019s return is below the covenanted rate of 10%, over the whole period 1999\u20132004, \nit has shown marked improvement in the past 2 years. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) \nexceeded  1.2  times  debt  obligations.  The  self-financing  ratio  (SFR)  in  most  years  is  low, \nindicating GTCL is unable to make any significant contribution to its own capital expenditure \nprogram out of revenues and is totally dependent on government funds for any major capital \nexpenditure  program.  GTCL\u2019s  capital  structure  is  consistent  with  that  expected  for  a \ntransmission utility company, with the debt financing in its capital structure now in the order of \n55%. Accounts receivable have exceeded 3 months of sales since 2001. Accounts receivable \ndo not translate into bad debts, with GTCL paid by Petrobangla once payment is received by \ndistribution companies.  \n \n3.  Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL)\u2019s revenue has steadily increased, \nwith net revenues growing by approximately 8% per annum, and net profit reaching Tk1,055 \nmillion in 2004. RNFA reached 24.1% in 2004 and is projected at 18.3% in 2005. The DSCR is \nwell in excess of 1.2 times debt obligations, and the SFR exceeds 30% of annual capital \nexpenditure.  BGFCL\u2019s  capital  structure  is  consistent  with  that  expected  for  a  production \ncompany with debt at or below 30% of the company\u2019s financing in all years of the review period.  \nThe  good  performance  of  BGFCL  reflects  the  very  low  cost  of  gas  from  SGCs\u2019  fields: \n$0.118/thousand cubic feet (MCF), compared with an average $1.610/MCF from international oil \ncompanies (IOCs). The RNFA reflects assets at very low historic costs, resulting in overstated \nreturns compared with present-day costs of exploration. BGFCL generates strong cash flows \nand  has  high  cash  reserves,  meaning  it can  meet  its short-term  development  and  drilling \nexpenditures.  \n \n4.  Sylhet  Gas  Fields  Company\u2019s  (SGFL\u2019s)  revenue  has  increased,  with  net  revenues \ngrowing by approximately 2% per annum, and net profit reaching Tk714 million in 2004. The \n ", "40  Appendix 10 \n  \nRNFA in 2003 was 12.1%, but declined to 11.4% in 2004 and is projected at 15.1% in 2005. \nThe DSCR is well in excess of 1.2 times debt obligations, and the SFR exceeds 30% of annual \ncapital expenditure. SGFL\u2019s capital structure is consistent with that expected for a production \ncompany with debt at or below 30% of the company\u2019s financing in all years of the review period. \n \n5.  Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company (BAPEX) derives the bulk \nof its revenues from the gas tariff exploration levy or BAPEX margin, which is currently Tk0.076/ \nm3. But since January 2005, Petrobangla has proposed that the margin be reduced to Tk0.048/ \nm3, as part was related to repayment of past foreign development loans. In 2004, 80% of \nrevenues were derived from this source. In the future, BAPEX is expected to have increased \nrevenues from gas sales, with gas production estimated at 300 million cubic feet (MMCF) for \n2005. The RNFA in 2004 was 2.5%. In the past, BAPEX has not been able to meet its DSCR on \nforeign loans; however, the loans have now all been repaid or converted to equity as they \nrelated to past development where fields were handed over to BGFCL or SGFL for operation, \nbut BAPEX retained the liabilities.  BAPEX debt-equity ratio is very low at 8:92, which is \nconsistent with an exploration company. \n \n6.  Revenues from gas sales activities of Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL) \nhave  increased,  with  total  revenues  growing  by  approximately  15%  per  annum.  Net  profit \nreached Tk65 million in 2001, its first year of operation, and then declined over the next 2 years \nbefore recovering to Tk51 million in 2004. The RNFA was 16.7% in 2002, the second year of \noperation, but since then has been lower in all the following years. It was 8.9% in 2004 and is \nprojected at 6.0% in 2005. The DSCR exceeded 1.2 times debt obligations in 2001\u20132004. The \nSFR is greater than 100%, with all development in fact financed by government loans and \nequity on a 60:40 basis through the Annual Development Program (ADP). \n \nB.  Financial Projections  \n7.  General.  Domestic  and  international  inflation  rates  as  projected  by  the  Economic \nRelations  Division  (ERD)  and  posted  on  the  ADB  intranet  were  used  for  the  projections. \nDomestic inflation is assumed at 5% for 2005, 4.5% thereafter throughout the forecast period. \nForeign inflation is assumed at 0% for all years. Capital costs incurred in foreign exchange \nincorporating  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  financing  charges  are  converted  to \ndomestic currency at the exchange ruling in the year of expenditure/drawdown. For operating \ncosts, where applicable, these are adjusted by the domestic rate of inflation year on year. \nSimilarly, it is assumed that revenue streams are maintained in real terms and rise at least by \nthe rate of projected inflation in each year. \n \n8.  Income Statement Assumptions.  Revenue was projected using the wheeling margin \nfor 2005 as a base, which is Tk0.36/m3, and condensate transmission charges of Tk1.0/liter for \n2005. The project financial analysis assumes that the current wheeling charge of Tk0.36/m3. will \nbe increased by 5% every 6 months, or 10.25% per annum. The new national pay scale, which \nwas introduced by the National Pay Commission in January 2005, was taken into account for \nprojections. Compressor operating costs other than fuel, to cover fixed overhauls, inspection, \nand variable costs are estimated at 2.5% of compressor capital costs. The workers share of \nprofits is assumed at 1/21 of net operating profit before tax. Future depreciation was based on \nGTCL average depreciation charge of 3.0% per annum. This is similar to that for the project \npipeline assets and compressors. Thus, a depreciation charge of 3.0% per year was assumed \nfor general additions over the forecast period. \n \n ", "Appendix 10          41 \n  \n \n9.  Interest charges are based on the funding assumptions set out for the project assets, \nadditional  GTCL  expenditures  loan  financing  over  2009  to  2015,  and  interest  charges  on \nexisting loans. Income tax on net profits is assumed at 37.5%. Although GTCL assessed tax \nlosses of Tk2,410 million at the end of 2004, the projections were prepared following provisional \ntax charges on the reported net operating profit for the year. Thus, actual tax payments will take \ninto account the accumulated losses. The financial projections assume that 40% of the after-tax \nincome is paid out to the Government annually as dividend. It is assumed that dividends would \nonly be paid out where cash flow permits. \n \n10.  Balance Sheet Assumptions.  Debtors are assumed at 3 months of sales up to 2008 \nand declining to 2.0 months by 2010. Creditors are set at 3 months of the year\u2019s expenditure on \nfuel, chemicals, repairs, and materials. Inventories are set at 3 month\u2019s expenditure on fuel and \nother  materials,  plus  a  percentage  of  fixed  asset  additions  of  0.1%.  Prepayments  where \napplicable are assumed to increase from their present level in line with inflation. Assumptions \nfor the field appraisal and Rajshahi area gas distribution components of the Project generally \nfollow those set out for GTCL.  \n \nC.  Projected Financial Performance  \n \n11.  GTCL\u2019s financial projections indicate GTCL\u2019s DSCR exceeds 1.2 in all years and its SFR \n20% in all years except 2007 (Table A10.2). The rate of return (ROR) covenant is not achieved \nuntil 2014. Given the size of GTCLs future investment plan, a SFR of 30% is covenanted, and \nthe ROR covenant is discontinued as it has not been met over the last 5 years.  \n \n12.  The financial projections indicate that BGFCL\u2019s DSCR exceeds 1.2 in all years and its \nSFR 20% in all years except 2005 (Table A10.2). Given the size of BGFCL\u2019s future investment \nplan, a SFR of 30% is covenanted, and the ROR is discontinued. BGFCL is a state company \ndependent on the ADP for funding. The ROR does not reflect the cost of capital and is artificially \nhigh because gas reserves have not been revalued in recent years. If gas reserves reflected \nreplacement costs based on current field production costs, rather than development costs in the \nearly  1970s,  then  the  ROR  would  fall  dramatically.  For  this  reason  the  covenant  is  not \nconsidered to have any real relevance to BGFCL.  \n \n13.  SGFL\u2019s DSCR is 1.2 and SFR is 30% in all years. Given the size of SGFL\u2019s future \ninvestment  plan  which  operationally  is  three  times  the  size  of  SGFL,  a  SFR  of  30%  is \ncovenanted,  and  the  ROR  covenant  is  discontinued.  Similar  to  BGFCL,  SGFL  is  a  state \ncompany dependent on the ADP for funding. The ROR does not reflect the cost of capital and is \nartificially high because gas reserves have not been revalued in recent years. If gas reserves \nreflected replacement costs based on current field production costs, rather than development \ncosts in the early 1970s then the ROR would fall dramatically.  \n \n14.  The DSCR of BAPEX exceeds 1.2 in all years (Table A10.2) from 2006 and on. All \nexploration and development expenditures are financed by the Government. It is assumed that \nroutine capital expenditures are funded by internal funds. Where possible, some exploration \nactivities  such  as  seismic  surveys  may  be  financed  out  of  revenues.  No  covenants  are \napplicable to BAPEX because its primary role is to explore in concession areas allocated to \nBAPEX and to find and develop new gas fields.  \n \n15.  PGCL\u2019s DSCR exceeds 1.2 in all years and its SFR 20% in all years after 2005. Similarly \nthe  ROR  exceeds  16%  from  2006  onward.  This  reflects  the  low  investment  necessary  in \ndistribution, with a large proportion of sales going directly to power plants.  \n ", "42  Appendix 10 \n  \nTable A10.1: Summary Audited

11 \n  \nFINANCIAL EVALUATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The financial analysis (FA) of the Project has been carried out in accordance with the \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nthe Asian Development Bank. The FA was conducted for only the gas transmission component \nof the Project. The evaluation and computation of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), \nincluding sensitivity evaluation, were carried out for the (i) pipeline extensions, (ii) existing \nsystem reinforcement, and (iii) overall system including expansions and extensions. The FA is \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the assumptions in the economic analysis. FA for each \nsubproject compared the FIRR with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Sensitivity \ntests were undertaken to assess the impact on the FIRR of project risks as reflected in cost \nincreases,  revenue  decreases,  and  construction  delays.  Without-project  and  with-project \nscenarios were compared. Without the Project, the ongoing gas shortages in Bangladesh with \nfrequent power brownouts would continue. With the Project, the available gas supply in the \nnortheast of Bangladesh from newly discovered fields, which are being developed, would be \navailable to meet gas shortages in the existing gas supply area and also serve the new market \nareas on the west side of the Jamuna bridge.  \n \nB.  Assumptions \n2.  The Project was evaluated over a 20-year period based on a 15-year design horizon to \n2017. Project benefit and cost streams were held constant from 2017 to 2027. The financial \nevaluation considered only the incremental revenues and costs directly associated with the \nProject. All costs and revenues are expressed in 2005 prices. Capital costs included physical \ncontingencies, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction for the period \n2005\u20132009.  An  average  exchange  rate  of  Tk60.0  per  $1.00  was  used  to  convert  foreign \nexchange costs to local currency equivalent in January 2005. Repair and maintenance costs of \nproject assets were based on estimates adopted in the economic evaluation. The allowance of \n2.5% of capital costs for compressor maintenance other than fuel included annual overhauls \nand any major overhauls that would maintain the life of the asset for 20 years. Proper routine \nmaintenance was assumed.  \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n3.  The risk-free interest rate for Bangladesh is a government-guaranteed 10-year bonds \nand they have an interest rate of 10%. For shorter terms, interest rates are up to 13%.  A 5% \nspread for sector and company risk was assumed for the indicative borrowing rate of 15% for \nlong-term  borrowings.  Given  the  relatively  stable  cash  flows  that  can  be  expected  from \ntransmission operations, a return to equity of 2% over corporate borrowing rates was assumed. \nRather than apply a beta factor, a further interest rate spread of 1% was assigned. When \ncombined with the risk-free interest rate, the cost of equity was 18%. The Government-set \nonlending rate on local loans was 4% with repayment over 15 years plus a grace period of 3\u20135 \nyears. The financial evaluation undertaken for individual gas supply subprojects represented the \nleast-cost options identified in the economic evaluation. Revenues were incremental revenues \nderived  from  the  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL)  wheeling  charges  on  the \nadditional gas volumes transported.

Sensitivity Analysis  \n \n5.  The sensitivity of the estimated FIRR of the gas transmission subprojects and the overall \nproject  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables  was  tested  (Table  A11.3).  The  variables  are \nincreases (+10%) in capital and operating and maintenance costs, and a reduction in project \nbenefits  (-10%).  A  combination  of  the  two  was  also  tested,  together  with  project  delays \naccompanied by increases in project costs. The sensitivity indicator and switching value were \ncalculated.  In  addition  a  number  of  specific  project  sensitivities  were  also  tested:  (i)  15% \nreduction in wheeling charges to Tk 0.36/thousand cubic feet (MCF), implying only half real \nincreases prior to July 2008; (ii) increase in compressor fuel consumption from 1.5% of gas \nvolumes to 2.5% of gas volumes; (iii) increase in compressor fuel costs from current average \ncosts of $0.55/MCF to $1.32/MCF; (iv) reduction in salvage value of pipelines by 50%, reflecting \na 25-year rather than a 40-year life; (v) 2-year delay in construction and a 20% increase in \noverall project costs. \n \nTable A11.3: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return (%) \n  \n  Financial Internal Rate of Return \nExisting \n   Overall  System  Expansion \nPipeline and  Pipeline and  Nalka- Bheramara- Bonpara-\n Parameter  Compressors  Compressors  Bheramara  Khulna  Rajshahi \nCapital +10%  11.1  14.1  8.1  5.5  5.5 \nOperating Costs +10%  11.8  14.8  8.8  6.1  6.1 \nBenefits -10%  10.7  13.6  7.8  5.2  5.3 \n2-year delay plus 20% capex  10.2  12.5  7.8  6.1  5.8 \ncapex = capital expenditure. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Increase  in  Fuel  Consumption  to  2.5%  of  Gas  Volumes.  An  increase  in  fuel \nconsumption to 2.5% rather than 1.5% of gas volume results in a FIRR in excess of the WACC \nin all the expansion projects, mainline project, and the overall project.  \n \n7.  Gas Price for Compressor Fuel, $1.74/MCF. Where the gas fuel cost is related to \ncontract prices of international oil company (IOC) and GTCL was required to meet this cost, \nthen the FIRR for Bonpara\u2013Rajashahi falls to 5.8% but is still well above the WACC. This \nsuggests that the expansion and mainline projects are robust.  \n \n8.  GTCL Wheeling Charge Only up to Tk0.42/m3 by July 2008. If the gas wheeling \ncharge does not increase in line with current 2003 \u201cinterim pricing framework\u201c and achieves only \nhalf the real increase anticipated by July 2008, then the FIRR for Bheremara\u2013Khulna in the \nworst case falls to 4.9%. Accordingly the projects are robust.  \n \n9.  Reduction in Residual Value of Pipeline Assets.  Where the economic life of pipeline \nassets assumed is 25 years, the FIRR still exceeds the WACC. However, the assuming a 40-\nyear life for pipelines in Bangladesh is regarded as reasonable, with pipelines in operation for 41 \nyears now  showing no sign of deterioration.  \n \n10.  Two\u2013Year Delay in Commissioning Associated with a 20% Increase in Project \nCosts. The extension projects would be sensitive to such results, with the worst case for \nBonpara-Rajshahi whose FIRR falls to 5.8%. . \n ", "Appendix 12          47 \n \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Estimation of Costs \n \n1.  Economic costs are in 2005 prices. Tradable commodities were valued at border prices \nat the prevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were valued through shadow prices \nusing a standard conversion factor. The capital costs, based on least-cost analysis, were also \nadjusted to eliminate inflation, interest during construction, and taxes. Capital costs include \ninvestments required in facilities to provide incremental gas sales and maintenance of the \nexisting gas system, and in gas distribution networks to support nonbulk customer sales of gas. \nThe estimation of costs also includes the calculation of a depletion premium. \n \nB.  Estimation of Benefits \n2.  The main economic benefit of the Project is the value of future imported petroleum fuels \nand indigenous energy sources that gas would displace with the extensions of the transmission \npipeline into the less developed areas, and growth in demand from new and existing customers \nin the existing gas supply area. The demand for gas was projected by taking into account all \nnew end users, the growth in demand from existing gas consumers, and the substituted gas \nconsumption by self-generated power using gas oil and gasoline (because of gas supply and \ntransmission  deficiencies).  The  demand  projections  are  based  on  a  conservative  growth \nscenario and include the likely completion of power plants planned on the basis of the power \nsector master plan. More details of the least cost analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n3.  The bulk of the additional gas volume consumed as a result of the pipeline will be non-\nincremental  sales  to  new  customers.  For  the  expansion  and  reinforcement  of  the  existing \nnetwork,  all  sales  are  also  nonincremental  in  nature.  No  major  incremental  benefits  are \nexpected from the Project, with all economic benefits valued as nonincremental sales in terms \nof resource cost savings. Quantifiable benefits in terms of resource cost savings are derived \nfrom international border prices adjusted for local transport to project locations, and for fuels \ndisplaced by gas over the forecast period. The quantity of heavy fuel oil (HFO) required for \npower stations in the absence of gas supply is reduced by 50% to reflect the practicality that \nthese would not be built if HFO was the only source, or, alternatively, further mine-mouth coal \nfired power stations would be built in preference to importing HFO. \n \n4.  Based  on  the  economic  fuel  costs  assuming  90%  of  the  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (IBRD) oil projections, the value of benefits based on the \neconomic value of fuels displaced by gas in the main line market growth and three western zone \nexpansion  projects  is  estimated  at  $643  million  in  2010  and  $2,220  million  in  2017  (at \n$4.14/thousand cubic feet [MCF] and $4.31/MCF, respectively). Bulk fuel substitution represents \n79% of the economic benefits and nonbulk comprises 21% (predominantly domestic substitution \nof  cooking  fuel  sources)  of  economic  benefits.  In  2017,  the  mainline  expansion  and \nreinforcement projects will provide 85% of the overall economic benefits.  \n \nC.  Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n5.  The basis for project evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the \nproject (base) case and the without-project (alternative) case. The project analysis period is 22 \nyears following expected full operation by 2011. The project construction period is 5 years from \n2005 to 2010. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated at 28.1%, indicating \nthat the Project is economically viable (Table A12.1). \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \n  \n6.  A complete quantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project was not possible \ndue to various factors including time and resources. Thus, the total benefits estimated in this \nanalysis  can  be  interpreted  as  conservative  estimates.  The  improvements  in  the  Gas \nTransmission Company Limited (GTCL) system and increased upstream gas supply will have a \nmaterial economic impact on Bangladesh\u2019s industry sector through improved electricity supply.  \nEliminating the use of more expensive fuels in standby generation and additional investment in \nstandby generation will be of great benefit. Operation of the pipeline system at higher pressures \nwill  lead  to  higher  gas  content  in  the  line  pack  and  reduce  short-term  reductions  in  gas \npressures. This will be particularly significant to fertilizer plants where a plant upset due to a \ndecline in pressures can require a number of days to restore the plant to efficient operations.  \n \n7.  The Project augurs well for the poverty reduction strategy of the Government. There will \nbe positive impacts to (i) households in terms of clean energy, reduced health hazards, reduced \nrespiratory diseases, reduced infant mortality, reduced cooking time, increased leisure/work \ntime, and savings in cost of energy; (ii) agriculture in terms of saved fuel sources (cow dung, \njute  sticks,  firewood,  and  tree  leaves),  reduced  trees  planted  and  harvested  in  firewood  \nplantations, and increased hardwood and fruit trees; and (iii) industry in terms of reduced time \nand costs in the weaving industry (yarn production and dyeing), greater cost competitiveness, \nand increased employment. \n \nTable A12.1: Economic Analysis ($ million) \n \nYear  Capital Cost  O&M Costs  Total Cost  Benefits  Net Benefits \n2005          0.0                0.0                0.0                0.0                      0.0    \n2006      108.0              0.0            108.0              0.0                (108.7) \n2007      220.5              0.0            220.5              0.0                (220.5) \n2008      223.0          119.9          342.9          189.1              (153.7) \n2009      211.3          169.7          381.0          282.9                (98.1) \n2010      155.4          219.2          374.6          377.7                    3.2  \n2011      119.0          390.0          509.0          670.7                161.7  \n2012        60.9          459.3          520.2          789.4                269.2  \n2013        69.8          544.5          614.3          930.8                316.5  \n2014        75.5          635.1          710.6       1,070.9                360.3  \n2015        98.7          740.9          839.6       1,226.9                387.4  \n2016        11.3          868.9          880.2       1,405.8                525.6  \n2017          9.6       1,015.8       1,025.4       1,597.6                572.1  \n2018          9.4       1,059.9       1,069.3       1,603.1                533.7  \n2019        15.5       1,110.5       1,126.0       1,610.5                484.5  \n2020          2.6       1,165.3       1,167.9       1,615.2                447.4  \n2021          5.2       1,226.6       1,231.8       1,619.5                387.7  \n2022          0.0         1,295.2       1,295.2       1,623.7                328.5  \n2023          0.0         1,372.1       1,372.1       1,627.9                255.9  \n2024          0.0         1,458.1       1,458.1       1,632.7                174.4  \n2025          0.0         1,554.5       1,554.5       1,637.4                  82.8  \n2026          0.0         1,662.4       1,662.4       1,641.7                (20.9) \n2027          0.0         1,783.2       1,783.2       1,645.9              (137.5) \nNPV      750.7      3,395.3      4,146.0      4,954.1               808.1 \n              EIRR                28.1% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh:  \nNatural gas accounts for about 70% of the total commercial energy consumption. It is still underutilized and inequitably \ndistributed throughout the country. Households\u2019 access to gas is even more limited. Throughout the country only 6% of the \npopulation is connected to pipelines, mainly in urban areas. Moreover, on the western side of the country, the energy \nconsumption ratio between poor and rich population is as high as 65%, while on the eastern side it is 30%. As gas can be \nused to produce electricity, one needs to take into account all positive effects, at both micro and macro levels, that greater \naccess to electricity is likely to produce. At the micro level, effects are very likely to be positive on agricultural productivity \n(e.g., for the use of irrigation pumps). Households are also known to diversify their sources of income once they are \nconnected to the grid. Education quality as well as health care services also tends to improve in electrified villages. At the \nmacro level, industrial productivity is also expected to drastically increase. The only negative effects that are presently \nforeseeable concern suppliers of alternative sources of energy, who are expected to incur income losses due to changes in \nhouseholds\u2019 preference patterns. Ultimately, however, the Project is expected to have an overall positive effect on poverty \nreduction in the project areas.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Project will make clean energy available to the less developed region of 15 million people (about 10% of the country\u2019s \npopulation). The analysis conducted during project preparation indicates that about 30% of total beneficiaries (about 4.5 \nmillion) are poor persons who will directly or indirectly benefit from the Project. Access to gas could reduce poverty by raising \nper capita available income of the households. The channels through which income of the poor would potentially increase are \n(i) expansion in nonfarm activities through diversified income generation activities; (ii) growth in agricultural income, mainly \ndue to access to cheaper fertilizers and irrigation pumps; (iii) changes in markets and the land tenure system (rise in wage \nrate, low water price, etc.); (iv) expansion of markets and institutions due to the availability of gas and electricity; (v) savings \nof time that could be devoted to other pursuits, particularly for women, who could be involved in extra economic activities; and \n(vi) low cost of natural gas compared with other sources of energy. Nonincome poverty can be reduced by (i) controlling \ndepletion of forest resources for environmental protection, reducing health-related diseases; (ii) empowering women by \ncreating income opportunities in different nonfarm activities; (iii) establishing social infrastructure that would provide better \nservices (e.g., health centers, educational institutions); and (iv) building social relation and status, etc. The Project will create \nabout 3,000 person-months of job opportunities for the unskilled labor category. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nDuring project preparation, all executing agencies (EAs) undertook consultations with local officials and village leaders that \nraised the level of awareness, gained local support, and enabled affected people to voice opinions and suggestions for \nproject design and implementation. The EAs particularly recognize the importance of the participatory approach for the \nresettlement issues, to reduce the risk of grievance by affected persons (APs) and will therefore work with local organizations \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to assure a correct communication stream with all the stakeholders. More details \nare in Supplementary Appendixes K and L. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nAll stakeholders will be actively involved to reduce the risk of grievance and to make sure that benefits are fairly distributed. \nHigh rates of participation are also known to increase a sense of ownership. In addition, in selecting unskilled labor in the \nproject area, the contractors will discuss with local towns\u2019 labor officials and local village leaders and they will also make sure \nthat labor will be hired on a nondiscriminatory basis. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nImpact on women is expected to be positive.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  Project  has  four  components:  part  A:  gas  transmission  expansion  and \nreinforcement, part B: field appraisal, part C: Rajshahi gas distribution, and part D: Building the \ncapacity of the gas sector. The Project will involve land acquisition for parts A, B, and C, but not \nfor part D. For part A, total permanent land acquisition is 159 hectares (ha); temporary land \nacquisition, 282 ha.26 Land acquisition will have permanent impacts on 305 households and \ntemporary impacts on 230 households. The resettlement plan (RP) for the Bheramara-Khulna \ntransmission pipeline (part A4) will be prepared upon finalization of the pipeline route, the \ndetailed survey for which is currently under way. The Executing Agency will submit a draft RP to \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  by  31  December  2005,  and  no  disbursement  for  the \nsubcomponent will be allowed prior to meeting requirements. Part B will involve temporary \nacquisition of 270 ha affecting 800 households. For part C, no individual owners will be affected \nsince the proposed gas distribution network will be aligned along the roadside and the proposed \ndistrict  regulating  stations  will  be  constructed  on  vacant  government  land  near  the  road \nalignment.27 More details on affected persons (AP), structures, common property resources, \nand  land  use  are  in  part  1  of  Supplementary  Appendix  O.  The  Government-endorsed \nresettlement framework (RF) is in part 2 of Supplementary Appendix O. The full RPs are in \nSupplementary Appendix N. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n2.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  are  based  on  national  law  (Acquisition  and \nRequisition of Immovable Property Ordinance [ARIPO], 1982) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995).

Information Dissemination, Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n3.  The preparation of the RP involved consultations with stakeholders, particularly APs. A \nsocioeconomic survey of APs was undertaken. Information campaigns were held for APs to \nprovide inputs to the RP. A resettlement information leaflet containing details on compensation \nand resettlement options was made available in the local language and distributed to APs. In \ncoordination with village and religious leaders, the project management unit (PMU), through \nstaff of its resettlement unit (RU), conducted consultations in affected villages to explain the RP. \nEach  AP  was  given  information  regarding  specific  entitlements.  The  summary  RP  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB web site, and information dissemination and consultation will continue \nthroughout project implementation. Grievance redress committees (GRCs) will be established \nfor project components with representation from the EA, APs (including vulnerable groups), \nlocal government, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Other than disputes relating to \nownership  rights  under  the  court  of  law,  the  GRC  will  review  grievances  involving  all \nresettlement benefits, relocation, and other assistance forwarded by the RU or APs. Grievances \nwill be redressed within 2\u20134 weeks from the date of the complaints. Appeals against GRC \ndecisions can be addressed by APs in appropriate courts of law. \n \nD.  Compensation and Income Restoration \n \n4.  Loss of land will be compensated at replacement cost. A cash grant will be provided to \naccount  for  the  difference  between  compensation  provided  under  the  Acquisition  and \nRequisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (ARIPO)  and  the  replacement  value.  The \nreplacement value will be based on the market value determined through a land market survey \nby the Joint Inventory Verification Team (JIVT). Replacement land for loss of land is not feasible \nbecause  very  small  land  areas  are  acquired  from  each  AP.  Loss  of  structures  will  be \ncompensated  in  accordance  with  the  compensation  provided  under  ARIPO  plus  a  house \nconstruction grant of Tk2,000 or 1/8th of the value of the ARIPO compensation (whichever is \nhigher), and a Tk3,000 transfer grant. APs renting affected structures are entitled to a transfer \ngrant of Tk3,000. Households owning homesteads of less than 100 square meters and losing \ntheir homesteads will be provided with a minimum of 100 square meters of land through private \nland purchase. APs losing wage labor or employment will receive a one-time maintenance grant \nof Tk100 per day for 90 days and will be provided vocational training. Preference will be given to \nAPs in labor for subproject activities. Practice in other pipeline sections allowed permanently \nacquired land in the pipeline corridor to be used by permanent land losers for agricultural \npurposes after civil works (use is restricted to cultivation of perennial crops, particularly trees). \nThis  gives  permanent  land  losers  a  continued  source  of  income.  Moreover,  there  is  no \nrestriction on the use of land beyond the acquired right-of-way width. Compensation for other \ncategories of losses is in the entitlement matrix.28  \n \n5.  APs without a definite means of livelihood are entitled to vocational training. Programs \nare specifically aimed at landless households, wage laborers, and sharecroppers affected by \nthe Project. Long-term training (2\u20136 months) will be provided on motor mechanics, driving, \nrickshaw assembly and repair, secretarial skills/word processing, plumbing, electrical and metal \nworks, and manufacture of rural sanitary equipment. Short-term (3\u20135 days) skills training for \nthose engaged in low-skill activities will be provided in fisheries, animal husbandry, vegetable \nraising and crop diversification, low-cost house construction and carpentry, and operation of hand \n                                                 \n28  Losses due to part B will also be compensated based on replacement cost. Replacement value will be based on \nthe market value determined by the joint impact verification team (JIVT). No compensation will be paid for shot \nholes in already harvested or barren land. However, shot holes will not be drilled in front of or in backyards of \nhouses, even if they are found to be barren. \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \n  \nlooms. Training, credit, and equipment provision for supplementary income-generating activities will \nalso be provided to target groups such as women for plant nurseries, tailoring and handicrafts, bee \nkeeping, and homestead gardening. Skills training on community health and hygiene, family welfare, \nand use of fuel-efficient ovens will also be provided to women to improve their quality of life. \nVocational training packages will be contracted out to NGOs.  \n \nE.  Institutional Framework and Resettlement Costs \n \n6.  The  EAs  are  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  for  part  A,  Bangladesh  Gas  Fields \nCompany Limited for part B, Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited for part C, and Petrobangla in \ncoordination with concerned agencies for part D. Implementing Agencies (IA) will be from the \nPetrobangla  group  of  companies.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  processing,  coordinating,  and \nsupervising all subprojects. The PMU, through its RU, will have overall coordination, planning, \nimplementation, management and monitoring, and financing responsibilities for the RP. The EA will \nensure that key institutions including the local government are involved in RP implementation. \nFurther, experienced NGOs will be hired for RP implementation with clearly defined tasks, including \ntraining and community-based social development programs as appropriate.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n7.  Implementation  of  the  RP  will  be  monitored  regularly.  A  computerized  management \ninformation system (CMIS) will be established to provide integrity of data records, better planning \nand decision making, improved resettlement services, problem detection on resettlement issues, and \nproject expenses and implementation within limits and schedules. The CMIS will provide household \nfiles for APs containing losses and entitlement, scheduled monitoring reports, progress reports, and \nfinancial reports. The PMU will establish a quarterly monitoring system involving staff of the IAs and \nimplementing NGO staff. The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports on all aspects of land \nacquisition and resettlement activities. The report will contain progress made in RP implementation \nwith particular attention to compliance with the principles and matrix set out in the RP. With ADB \nconcurrence, the EA will engage in an independent monitoring agency to carry out annual external \nmonitoring of the resettlement operations. The external monitor will be selected within 3 months of \nloan approval. \n \n ", "Appendix 15          57 \n  \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.    Introduction \n \n1.

Disclosure, Consultation and Grievances \n \n6.  Government  authorities,  local  community  groups,  and  members  of  the  public  were \nconsulted during preparation of the IEEs. The ADB team also visited project sites and held \nconsultations with local communities whose land will be affected during construction and with \nlocal business leaders. Further structured consultations will continue, and the EMP will be \nimproved accordingly. For the resettlement work, a Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) has \nbeen set up to address all concerns and grievances.  \n \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n7.  The  EMP  will  include  both  internal  and  external  monitoring.  The  environmental \nspecialists in the project management units (PMUs) will be responsible for internal monitoring of \nEMP implementation, and will forward quarterly progress reports to the EA. The reports will \ncontain progress made in EMP implementation, with particular attention to compliance with the \nprinciples and matrix set out in the EMP. The Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) and \nPashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL) will submit semiannual monitoring reports to \nADB. With ADB concurrence, GTCL and PGCL will hire an independent individual expert to \nundertake  external  monitoring  of  the  entire  Project.  The  independent  monitor  who  will  be \nselected within 3 months of loan approval, will report on a semiannual basis directly to ADB, \ndetermine  whether  sound  environmental  management  practices  have  been  achieved,  and \nsuggest  suitable  recommendations  of  remedial  measures  for  midterm  correction  and \nimprovement.

Conclusion \n9.  The  Project  will  have  minimal  negative  environmental  impacts,  which  can  be \nsuccessfully mitigated by implementing the component-specific EMPs. On the basis of the IEEs, \nthere is no need for a full environmental impact assessment. However, the EAs will need to \nstrengthen their capabilities to implement and monitor the EMPs. This need has been designed \ninto  the  project  by  requiring  environmental  specialists  in  the  PMUs  and  the  hiring  of  an \nindependent monitor. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051027180725+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051004171214+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R257-05.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "AJ3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "  PCU  \u2013  project coordinating unit \n  PGCL  \u2013  Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited \n  PMU  \u2013  project management unit \n  PRSP  \u2013  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n  PSC  \u2013  production sharing contract \n  PSP  \u2013  private sector participation \n  ROR  \u2013  rate of return \n  RP  \u2013  resettlement plan \n  RU  \u2013  resettlement unit \n  SCADA  \u2013  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition \n  SFR  \u2013  self-financed ratio \n  SGC  \u2013  state-owned gas company \n  SGFL  \u2013  Sylhet Gas Fields Limited \n  SIEE  \u2013  summary initial environmental examination \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TGTDCL  \u2013  Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited \n  TNGDP  \u2013  Third Natural Gas Development Project \n  TOR  \u2013  terms of reference \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n  BCF  \u2013  billion cubic feet \n  kgoe  \u2013  kilogram oil equivalent \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  m3    cubic meter \n  MCF  \u2013  thousand cubic feet \n  MMCF  \u2013  million cubic feet \n  MMCFD  \u2013  million cubic feet per day \n  TCF  \u2013  trillion cubic feet \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year FY of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of P.
