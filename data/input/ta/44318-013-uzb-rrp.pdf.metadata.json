I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Housing for Integrated \nRural Development Investment Program.1 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Uzbekistan has achieved high rates of economic growth in recent years (with gross \ndomestic  product  growth  of  8.5%  in  2010),  led  by  services  (13.2%),  industry  (8.3%),  and \nagriculture (7.1%).2 Although growth is geographically widespread, rural development has not \nkept pace with urban development. Over 70% of the poor live in rural areas and, while declining, \nrural poverty remains higher (22.2% in 2009) than urban poverty (15.2% in 2009). \n \n3.  Rural livelihoods. Increases in the working age population (up from 54% in 2001 to \n61%  in  2007),  higher  population  growth  in  rural  areas,  and  significant  retrenchment  of \nagricultural jobs due to ongoing market reforms, are putting pressure on rural employment and \njobs. As a result, migration to cities is on the rise, as is the share of people in seasonal jobs and \ninformal employment. Changing this trend requires economic transformation, diversification, and \nindustrialization, and a focus on private sector development and accelerated expansion of micro \nand small enterprises (MSEs) responsible for generating over 50% of rural jobs nationwide. \nInputs to attract and retain professionals with the skills needed to drive this transition include (i) \nquality education and health, (ii) better telecommunications and reliable infrastructure services, \n(iii) regional investment promotion and development of regional industrial hubs, (iv) access to \nbetter housing and living standards, and (v) increased access to finance. \n \n4.  Rural housing. Most rural houses were built during the Soviet period and are occupied \nby  extended  multigenerational  families. While  rural  access  to  basic  utilities  is  widespread, \nservices are inconsistent and unreliable. The 60,000 new houses that are constructed annually \nare insufficient to keep up with population growth (1.5% per year) and the needs of the 200,000 \nyoung families ready to leave the parental home each year. About 1.5 million households are in \nneed of new housing or major renovation annually, and finance to underpin this investment has \nnot been available. \n \n5.  Housing finance. The housing finance market is nascent. In 2009, the housing finance \nmarket amounted to about 1% of gross domestic product, with less than 10% of real estate \ndeals financed through bank loans. Expansion of housing loan portfolios is constrained by lack \nof access to cost-effective long-term funding and high inflation risk.3 Affordable housing finance \nis almost nonexistent,4 and personal savings and informal loans remain the main source for new \nhousing. \n \nTable 1: Residential Housing Loans (SUM billion) \n  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nItem  No.  SUM  No.  SUM  No.  SUM  No.  SUM  No.  SUM  No.  SUM \nRural  28  0.4  97  1.2  1,272  20.1  2,258  42.5  2,471  59.6  7,818  267.3 \nUrban  172  2.2  672  9.7  4,434  99.7  6,360  208.4  3,952  128.5  2,064  75.2 \nTotal  200  2.6  769  10.9  5,706  119.7  8,618  250.9  6,423  188.1  9,882  342.5 \nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  Inflation reached 14.1% in 2009, and is estimated at 9.3% for 2010 and 9.5% for 2011. Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). 2010. Asian Development Outlook 2010 Update. Manila. \n4  For creditworthy borrowers, interest rates for housing finance range from 12% to 20%, with a tenor of 5 to 15 years. \nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). ", "2 \n \n6.  As a strategic focus of the government\u2019s Rural Development Program (RDP), the Rural \nHousing Scheme (RHS) was initiated in 2009 to launch the rural housing finance market. One \nthird of all rural housing loans issued in 2009 and 85% of those issued in 2010 fall under the \nRHS. The Qishloq Qurilish Bank (QQB), a majority state-owned bank with an extensive national \nbranch network, is solely mandated to provide rural housing loans under the RHS. Under the \nRHS, the maximum loan size is 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage with a repayment \nperiod of 15 years (including a 6-month grace period), and an annual interest rate equal to 50% \nof the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) refinancing rate (12% effective as of 1 January 2011). \nRHS borrowers are required to make a minimum down payment of 25% and purchase mortgage \ninsurance. \n \n7.  Strategic  context.  The  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  2008\u20132010  (WIS)5 sets  out \ngovernment priorities for inclusive economic growth and the context for the RDP and RHS. \nUnder the RDP, which focuses on stimulating rural economic opportunities, 500,000 rural jobs \nhave  been  created,  7,647  new  rural  houses  built,  and  rural  infrastructure  and  social  and \ncommunity facilities expanded and improved. The RHS, a critical pillar of the RDP, channels \nrural savings and remittances into investment in new housing and construction, and engages \nlocal contractors and uses local construction materials for RHS house construction to generate \nrural jobs. In 2011, building on the achievements of the RDP and the RHS, the government \nadopted the multisector Housing for Integrated Rural Development Strategy (HIRDS). \n \n8.  Housing for Integrated Rural Development Strategy. Under the HIRDS, integrated \nrural development will be supported through expanded access to affordable housing finance, \nnew  and  improved  rural  housing  and  associated  infrastructure  and  services,  strengthened \nhokimiyat (local  government)  capacity,  and  MSE  development.  The provision  of  affordable \nmodern rural housing is the strategic driver for accelerating rural development nationwide. The \nexpansion of improved rural infrastructure, provided in conjunction with the RHS and close \nintegration with the MSE strategy, will help address key constraints to MSE development and \nthe generation  of  new livelihoods  and  employment  opportunities. In addition  to  reforms  to \nimprove  the  enabling  environment  for  MSEs,  new  modern  homes  with  reliable  access  to \nelectricity and water stimulate rural home-based microenterprises and cottage industries often \nrun by women. The development of modern rural housing and expanded access to affordable \nhousing finance supports MSE development to promote more inclusive growth. \n \n9.  The HIRDS encompasses a 5-year extension of the RHS from 2011 to 2015, under \nwhich an additional 40,800 houses will be built and over 40,000 construction jobs will be created \nannually.  To  accelerate  the  development  of  the  rural  construction  sector,  while  increasing \naccess to affordable housing finance and newly constructed RHS houses, government interest \nrate support and a number of tax concessions (offered to QQB, contractors, and construction \nmaterial  suppliers)  will  continue  to  be  provided.6 Critical  professionals\u2014doctors,  nurses, \nteachers, and entrepreneurs\u2014who are needed to advance social welfare in rural areas and \nstimulate  rural  economic  opportunities  and  growth,  will  be  targeted  for  RHS  housing  and \nhousing finance. While the HIRDS supports further downstreaming and greater outreach to \nmoderate and low-income households, RHS beneficiaries who satisfy credit appraisal criteria \nwill not be the poorest of the poor.7 Building on lessons and experiences from the RHS to date, \n                                                \n5  With ADB support, the government is preparing a new WIS for 2013\u20132015. In the interim, the WIS (2008\u20132010) \ncontinues to guide the government\u2019s development and investment programs. \n6  Governments globally support housing subsidies: supply-side (to incentivize lenders, developers, builders, etc.) \nand demand-side (to ensure housing/housing finance is affordable to targeted groups). See Global Comparison of \nHousing Subsidies (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  During the first year of the RHS, without selection criteria, 99% of the 847 RHS homebuyers were households from \nthe highest income quartile. Downstreaming was initiated in 2010 following intensive policy dialogue with ADB on \n ", "3 \nas well as those from previous housing programs (focused on urban areas), public awareness, \ntransparency, and accountability of site, beneficiary and contractor selection processes are \nbeing improved, inventories of non-agricultural land for rural housing are being developed, and \npricing of new houses and housing construction costs are being closely monitored. \n \n10.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE),  which  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  HIRDS, \nsupports close coordination and better integration of the RHS and the RDP with the Financial \nSector  Development  and  MSE  strategies  to  leverage  synergies  and  improve  development \noutcomes.  Under  the  HIRDS,  hokimiyats  play  a  central  role  in  preparing  integrated  rural \ndevelopment plans and regional investment strategies in close consultation with the private \nsector. Local governments are also important RHS and RDP stakeholders. District hokimiyats \nare required to provide RHS housing sites from state-reserved lands, assure that the sites are \napproved for residential use in accordance with state regulations, and coordinate the sites\u2019 \naccess to basic infrastructure and utility services. Provincial hokimiyats engage local contractors \nto construct new RHS houses. District hokimiyats, in consultation with mahallas (citizen-based \norganizations) and local women\u2019s committees, are responsible for screening RHS applicants. \n \n11.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  strategy.  Rural  development  is  a  priority  for \npromoting pro-poor growth under both the WIS and the ADB country strategy and program \n(CSP).8 By helping to improve rural living conditions and livelihood opportunities, the investment \nprogram  is  consistent  with  both  the  government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives,  and \ncomplements past and current ADB programs to improve rural and MSE development. 9 ADB\u2019s \ncurrent country strategy, anchored on the WIS, focuses ADB assistance on energy, transport, \nbasic  services  (education,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation),  and  agricultural \ndevelopment  (including  water  management  and  irrigation),  as  well  as  private  sector \ndevelopment and access to finance. \n \n12.  Multitranche financing facility (MFF). The government has requested ADB support \nthrough an MFF to help finance housing loans for moderate- and low-income households and \nsupport capacity development to strengthen implementation of the HIRDS. The MFF enables \nADB to enter into a partnership with a longer-term government commitment built upon shared \nprinciples. The MFF also helps ADB sequence and link investment support to the HIRDS road \nmap and policy framework, and implementation of programmed reforms, institutional change, \nand  critical  improvements  in  fiduciary  oversight.  Other  ADB  modalities  considered  did  not \naddress the requirements of the government. All MFF preconditions are in place: a strategy and \nroad map, a policy framework, and an investment program and financing plan. \n \n13.  Policy framework. The HIRDS road map and policy framework provides a basis for an \nin-depth policy dialogue on the investment program, and enables ADB investment support for \nrural  housing  to  be  transparently  structured  and  results-based.  During  tranche  1,  public \nawareness and transparency of RHS beneficiary selection and procurement processes will be \nimproved. RHS beneficiary selection criteria and selection process will be strengthened to reach \nmoderate- to low-income borrowers (young families and first-time homeowners, teachers, and \nhealth  care  workers  [two  occupations  in  which  women  predominate])  and  other  skilled \nprofessionals,10 and targets will be set for subsequent tranches to improve outreach of the RHS \n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe investment program, and about 74% of RHS beneficiaries for 2010 are from the third income quartile. For 2011, \nabout 85% of RHS beneficiaries are within the third (75%) and second (8%) income quartiles. \n8  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Uzbekistan, 2006\u20132010. Manila.

Refer to the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "4 \nto low-income households. To mitigate real estate or land speculation, RHS homebuyers will be \nrequired to make significant down payments and maintain houses financed under the RHS as \ntheir primary residence. RHS site selection will be undertaken in full accordance with national \nand ADB safeguard policies. Measures to address fiduciary and governance concerns will be \nstrengthened to ensure transparency and accountability for land acquisition, the selection of \ncontractors, and procurement of construction materials. Additional measures will be adopted to \nensure the quality of new houses and value for money. Programs to improve hokimiyat capacity, \nand address constraints to rural and MSE development, will be developed and rolled out. \n \n14.  Critical policy actions and reform measures will be preconditions for ADB finance post-\ntranche 1. For tranches 2 (2013), 3 (2014), and 4 (2015), benchmarks have been defined for \nphasing out interest rate support11 and promoting greater competition and efficiency. By 1 \nJanuary 2013 (tranche 2), the RHS will be open to other participating commercial banks (PCBs) \non the same concessional terms. The multiple roles of the Qishloq Qurilish Invest (QQI), which \ncurrently acts as a construction supervisor and, through its subsidiaries, as a supplier of some \nRHS  construction  materials,  will  be  phased  out.  By  1  January  2013  (tranche  2),  QQI \nconstruction material factories will be spun off. By 1 January 2014 (tranche 3), QQI will be \nestablished as an independent legal entity, and the RHS will be open to other developers and \nconstruction supervisors on the same concessional terms. Based on a study undertaken during \ntranche 2, the government will pilot viable options for sustainable public support for low-income \nrural housing during tranche 3 and 4, and develop a strategy to expand outreach to low-income \nrural households for the next phase of the RHS. During subsequent tranches, training programs \nfor hokimiyats will be enhanced, and key legislation and regulations needed to improve the \nenabling environment for housing finance and MSEs will be adopted. \n \n15.  Capacity development. MOE will strengthen intergovernmental coordination to achieve \ngreater integration and synergies of government strategies and programs that support rural \ndevelopment.  Training  programs  will  be  improved  to  strengthen  hokimiyat  capacity  for \nintegrated  rural  development  planning  and  investment  promotion.  Rural  job  creation  and \ndemand-driven skills training and re-skilling programs will be closely coordinated with the private \nsector  and  with  regional  investment  promotion  strategies  to  generate  sustainable  rural \nemployment opportunities. A review of global approaches and best practices will determine next \nsteps for further enhancement of the MSE enabling environment and expansion of rural MSEs. \n \n16.  Opportunities will be explored to further improve the impact of the RHS. A results-based \nmonitoring and evaluation framework will be developed and implemented to track outreach to \ntargeted beneficiaries of RHS houses and mortgages, as well as rural growth, investment and \njob creation. Studies will be undertaken to evaluate: (i) sustainable options for extending public \nsupport for housing (particularly for lower-income housing); (ii) alternative energy and energy \nefficient options for improving RHS house designs; and (iii) measures to strengthen government \nprocurement processes (and the oversight role of the State Committee of Architecture and \nConstruction [SCAC] and related agencies. To ensure prudent expansion of rural mortgage \nportfolios, credit appraisal processes and portfolio risk management procedures and systems of \nPCBs will be strengthened.12 An independent technical and financial performance audit will be \n                                                \n11 With  no  established  pricing  benchmark  for  long-term  mortgage  loans  to  moderate  and  low-income  rural \nhouseholds, the CBU refinancing rate serves as a proxy for the market rate. By tranche 4 (2015), the weighted \naverage RHS interest rate will equal the market interest rate assuming the CBU refinancing rate falls to 7% in \naccordance with current government forecasts. For details of specific benchmarks see footnote 19. \n12 In addition to PCBs\u2019 own capacity strengthening programs (for which SUM5.8 billion [$3.4 million] is allocated), \nstandardized approaches for credit evaluation and portfolio risk management, in accordance with best practices, \nwill  be developed  and  adopted under  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy.  For  the  latter,  technical \nassistance (TA) support to the CBU and PCBs is being considered under ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for \nFinancial Sector Development in Central and West Asia.

Impact and Outcome \n17.  In support of greater inclusive economic growth, the expected impact of the investment \nprogram is improved living standards for rural communities. With more and better rural housing, \nthe outcome of the investment program is improved rural housing for targeted beneficiaries.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  The investment program will deliver three outputs: (i) finance for approximately 40,800 \nnew  rural  houses  through  loans  extended  by  PCBs  to  targeted  RHS  homebuyers,  and \nstrengthened investment program implementation to achieve greater development impact; (ii) \ncapacity development for hokimiyats in project areas to prepare and better implement their \nintegrated rural development plans and investment promotion strategies; and (iii) reforms to \nsupport  an  improved  enabling  environment  to  encourage  and  accelerate  rural  MSE \ndevelopment. Project 1 will finance approximately 10,300 houses, capacity development for \nhokimiyats, MOE, QQB and related bodies, and project management support.  Other investment \nprogram outputs are detailed in Appendix 1. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n19.  The total cost of the investment program is $3.0 billion, most of which will be financed by \nthe  government.  An  MFF  of  up  to  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  is \nrequested  to  enable  the  government  to  address  demand  for  housing  finance  by  targeted \nbeneficiaries and to strengthen the investment program\u2019s development impact.  \n \nTable 2: Investment Program, FY2011\u2013FY2015 \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nComponent 1:  Rural housing loans for new rural housing      3,028.5a, b \nComponent 2:  Improving hokimiyat (local government) capacity          2.0 \nComponent 3:  Improving the enabling environment for micro and small enterprises        24.0 \n  Total   3,054.5 \na  Includes $2.31 billion for new rural housing ($1.48 billion for rural housing loans and $833.5 million in homebuyer \ndown payments); $323 million for related utilities and social services; $386 million for community and commercial \nfacilities; and $4.4 million for capacity development. \nb  Does not include land, taxes, duties, interest, and other in-kind government contributions or incentives (tax \nconcessions for RHS participating banks, contractors, and suppliers, and mortgage tax credits for homeowners). \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Uzbekistan. \n \n20.  The MFF will consist of approximately four tranches, each conditioned on submission of \nrelated periodic financing requests, execution of related loan and project agreements for each \ntranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement.13 Tranche 1 of $200 million will be provided as a loan with an 18-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \nFurther tranches will be subject to the availability of finance and allocation arrangements under \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.\n \n                                                \n13 The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Financing Plan for the Investment Program, FY 2011\u2013FY2015 \n  Component 1   Components 2 and 3  Total Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  500.0a  \u2026  500.0  16.4 \nParticipating commercial banks  536.3b    536.3  17.5 \nRHS homebuyers (down payments)  833.5  \u2026  833.5  27.3 \nGovernment of Uzbekistan  773.1c  26.0  799.1  26.2 \nPrivate sector  385.6  \u2026  385.6  12.6 \nTotal  3,028.5  26.0  3,054.5  100.0 \n\u2026 = not available, RHS = Rural Housing Scheme. \na  Includes $1 million for capacity building under the investment program. \nb  Includes $3.4 million for capacity building under the investment program. \nc  Includes $450 million in concessional financing ($90 million annually) to participating commercial banks. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Uzbekistan. \n \n21.  Relending, foreign exchange risk, and interest rate support. The ADB loans will be \nlent to the government in US dollars for 18 years (including a 3-year grace period). The ADB \nloans (less $1 million for capacity development) will be relent to PCBs in SUM under the same \nterms. Recognizing the social focus of the RHS and without an established pricing benchmark \nfor raising long-term SUM, the government will assume the foreign exchange risk14 and relend \nthe SUM equivalent under subsidiary loan agreements to PCBs at an annual interest rate \nsatisfactory to ADB.15 PCBs will onlend to RHS homebuyers (subborrowers) subloans in SUM at \nan annual interest rate to be determined in consultation with ADB, that allows for a sufficient \noperating and profit margin and supports the phase out of interest rate support.16 The maximum \nsubloan size will be the lower of 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage or the SUM equivalent \nof $50,000, offered for a term not exceeding 15 years (including a 6-month grace period).17 \nUnder Tranche 1, $199,600,000 will be relent by the government to QQB for onlending to the \nRHS homebuyers, and $400,000 will be made available to MOE for implementing the capacity \ndevelopment and project management support activities. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The investment program will be implemented during 2011\u20132016, in accordance with \narrangements and procedures outlined in the facility administration manual (FAM). MOE will be \nthe executing agency, and MOE and PCBs will be the implementing agencies. The procurement \nprocess for selection of RHS contractors will follow established national commercial practices \nand procedures acceptable to ADB. Due to the remoteness and geographical scattering of rural \nhousing sites, and relatively small values of civil work contracts, the works are likely to be \ncarried out by local contractors using locally sourced construction materials and supplies.18 \n                                                \n14 The cost of the foreign exchange risk is estimated at 8%\u20139% (CBU\u2019s forecast for SUM depreciation against the US \ndollar is used as a proxy). In accordance with ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM \nD6/BP. Manila (part D.4, paras. 17\u201319); and ADB. 2008. Foreign Exchange Risk. Operations Manual. OM H7/BP. \nManila (part C.2, paras. 11\u201313), \u2015ADB may consider subsidization of foreign exchange risk if warranted by country \nor project-specific considerations\u2016. \n15 This arrangement assumes government interest rate support to PCBs for foreign exchange risk. ADB policies back \nsuch support provided that it is targeted, transparent, fiscally sustainable, and includes an exit strategy. In addition, \nthe government provides a number of tax incentives and tax credits. \n16 For tranche 1 (2012), the RHS interest rate will be fixed at 7%. For tranche 2 (2013), the RHS interest rate will be \nthe weighted average of: 7% applied to years 1\u201310, and 100% of the CBU refinancing rate applied to years 11\u201315. \nFor tranche 3 (2014) and tranche 4 (2015), the RHS interest rate will be the weighted average of: 7% applied to \nyears 1\u20135, and 90% and 100%, respectively, of the CBU refinancing rate applied to years 6\u201315. \n17 For 2011, ADB\u2019s financing share for each subloan is 0%. ADB\u2019s financing share for each subloan is 65% in 2012, \n45% in 2013, 40% in 2014, and 35% in 2015. Over the 5-year MFF term, ADB\u2019s average financing share is 35%. \n18 While international competitive bidding is not precluded, it is unlikely that foreign bidders will be attracted to the \nlabor-intensive residential construction works to be undertaken at 300\u2013400 sites across the country. \n ", "7 \nProcurement  arrangements  have  been  defined  in  the  FAM  in  full  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s \nCentral Operations Services Office. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2011\u2013July 2016 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2016 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Ministry of Economy  \n(ii)   Implementing agencies  Ministry of Economy, participating commercial banks  \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Ministry of Economy project implementation unit \nProcurement  Advance action for procurement will be undertaken. \nDisbursement   Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  Single Source Selection of Qishloq Qurilish Invest.    ADB requires PCBs to ensure \nthe construction of RHS houses financed by PCB loans are contracted for in accordance with \nprocurement processes acceptable to ADB. While construction contracts will be awarded based \non competitive bidding procedures, all RHS homebuyers are required to contract solely with \nQQI for the purchase of RHS houses. For QQI services, homebuyers will be directly responsible \nfor all payments related to QQI\u2019s services.19 Thus, while costs related to QQI\u2019s services will not \nbe  financed  by  ADB,  ADB  procurement  guidelines  require  that  ADB  satisfy  itself  that  the \nprocedures  employed  will  result  in  the  selection  of  a  construction supervisor  that  has the \nnecessary professional qualifications and will carry out the assignment in accordance with the \nagreed schedule; and that the scope of the assignment is consistent with the needs of the \ninvestment program. ADB is satisfied that the selection of QQI meets these criteria. \n \n24.  QQI was established to  oversee and supervise the construction of RHS houses to \nensure that the nationwide RHS is properly managed, transaction costs are minimized, and \nconstruction is timely and in accordance with state building and construction standards. In \nfulfilling  its  multiple  roles,  QQI  has  gained  considerable  experience  and  demonstrated \nsatisfactory capacity to implement these tasks. Moreover, the quality and pace of the RHS will \nbe difficult to ensure without the services of QQI and, as such, its involvement under initial \ntranches remains necessary. ADB procurement procedures allow for single source selection (by \nRHS homebuyers) under specific circumstances and will be applied with exclusivity to QQI only \nfor tranches 1 and 2. Thereafter, QQI will be restructured as an independent legal entity, and \nthe RHS program will be open for homebuyers to buy from other developers or construction \nsupervisors. Subsequent to tranche 2, QQI will remain eligible to participate as long as it \ncontinues to meet program criteria, but will no longer be engaged on a single source basis. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Economic impact. Housing investment stimulates economic activity and creates jobs. \nLong-term funding reduces liquidity risk for banks and boosts overall bank lending. Savings for \ndown payments and loan repayments from homebuyers increase available financial assets and \ndemand for financial services. \n                                                \n19 The government is the RHS \u2015developer\u2016. The state owns the proposed housing sites and, together with relevant \nutility agencies, provides sites with access to basic services. QQI, a wholly owned subsidiary of QQB, is mandated \nas the sole construction supervisor for the RHS. As an agent for both hokimiyats and RHS homebuyers, QQI \nsupervises construction quality and building standards of RHS houses. QQI also owns a number of construction \nmaterial factories from which RHS contractors may procure supplies when they are not otherwise available. \n ", "8 \n \n26.  Demand and affordability. Thus far, more than 65,000 inquiries have been registered \nfor the RHS, with more than 10,000 applications received for the 7,400 houses to be built in \n2011. There is significant demand by creditworthy beneficiaries, which will increase with broader \npublic communication of the RHS (footnote 7). The price for RHS new houses built in 2011, \nbroadly ranges from $41,143 to $52,898 (SUM70 million\u2013SUM90 million). With less than 35% of \nhousehold income in the form of formal wages, the annual income for targeted beneficiaries is \nestimated at $7,656 to $20,902. Assuming a minimum down payment of 25% and mortgage \npayment to income ratios (as is currently applied to rural households), house prices that range \nfrom $25,513 to $104,479 (SUM42 million\u2013SUM173 million) are within the generally affordability \nof RHS targeted beneficiaries.20 Specific targets for subsequent tranches will be defined during \ntranche 1 to ensure an increasing proportion of low-income households are reached. Viable \noptions will be explored to expand outreach to lower-income beneficiaries over the longer term. \n \n27.  Price setting and value for money. The contract price for houses constructed under \nthe RHS is cost-based and based on the final bid from the winning contractor. Costs additional \nto  contractor  costs  are  detailed  in  the  homebuyer\u2019s  purchase  agreement.  A  number  of \nsignificant cost-containment measures have been adopted and will remain in place. \n \n28.  Financial viability and sustainability. The investment program is financially viable and \nfiscally sustainable. QQB and other prospective PCBs have experience in housing finance and \nare  committed  to  expanding  rural  mortgage  lending  portfolios  in  a  prudent  manner,  and \nupgrading rural credit appraisal and mortgage portfolio risk management systems. Sustainability \nwill be supported by opening the RHS to other PCBs and developers, phasing out interest rate \nsupport, and adopting measures to improve public support to the sector. \n \nB.  Governance \n29.  The  investment  program  features  important  design  elements  to  support  good \ngovernance and ensure accountability and transparency: (i) adopting and broadly publicizing \nwell-defined beneficiary selection criteria; (ii) implementing an accountable beneficiary selection \nprocess with coordinated involvement of district hokimiyats, mahallas, and branch offices of the \nwomen\u2019s committee; (iii) publicizing the RHS pricing mechanism, cost saving measures, and tax \nconcessions;  (iv)  providing  accessible  recourse  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms;  (v) \nundertaking of a technical\u2013financial performance audit and value for money assessment; (vi) \npublishing a results-based performance report annually on the investment program; and (vii) \nsupporting accelerated market development and greater competition with implementation of \nimportant measures under the policy framework (as outlined in para. 14). \n \n30.  The  government  and  QQB\u2019s  financial  management  capacity,  and  policies  and \nprocedures,  have  been  assessed  as  satisfactory.  A  FAM  outlining  investment  program \nimplementation  arrangements  including  additional  measures  to  strengthen  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  will  be  adhered  to  throughout  implementation.  Legal \nagreements include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit government and PCBs\u2019 records \nand  accounts  related  to  the  investment  program.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and QQB. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \n                                                \n20 For 2011, the average down payment made by approved RHS applicants (of which more than 80% are within the \ntargeted income threshold [i.e., within the second and third income quartiles]) is more than 35%. The affordability \nassessment is outlined in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The investment program, while not a targeted intervention, is aligned with the CSP and \nsupports the government\u2019s goal of reducing poverty to 20% by 2015. By providing access to \naffordable housing finance and modern new rural housing, the program plays an important role \nin  greater  inclusive  economic  growth,  improving  rural  living  standards,  and  meeting  the \nMillennium Development Goals. The investment program will contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough employment generation in the rural construction sector and ancillary industries and by \nenabling development and expansion of rural entrepreneurs and MSEs.  \n \n32.  While Uzbekistan has a good record in gender equality, inequalities remain. Without \nregular income or collateral, women are constrained and unable to access finance for housing \nor  business  startups.  Legally,  men  and  women  have  equal  access  and  property  rights  to \nhousing and land. Traditionally, however, title is issued in the name of the registered borrower \nwho, in most cases, are men. The investment program is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming because it aims to promote better outreach and access to rural housing finance \nand improved rural housing and employment opportunities for women. \n \nD.  Technical \u2013 Construction Sector \n33.  Uzbekistan\u2019s construction sector is well established and comprises engineering and \ndesign services, builders and contractors, and construction equipment and construction material \nfactories. In 2009, over 20,000 construction companies were registered, of which more than \n90% are privately owned. Construction firms have broad experience with infrastructure projects \nand public and commercial buildings. While there are few small residential housing developers, \nwhich generally focus on urban areas, a large number of contractors  exist with significant \ninterest and capacity to build RHS houses. At 10% of the total value of civil works undertaken \nannually, the investment program will significantly stimulate the rural construction sector. \n \n34.  To ensure transparency and accountability of construction quality assurance processes, \nthe government has mandated oversight roles to SCAC and other key agencies. The SCAC \nassesses  RHS  house  designs,  engineering  specifications,  and  unit  costs,  and  oversees \ncompliance  with  state  building  and  construction  standards.  The  SCAC  also  monitors \nconstruction compliance with state norms and standards, and ensures inspection requirements \nare adhered to. Adherence to requirements will be closely monitored, and assessed as an \nintegral component of the annual independent technical\u2013financial performance audit. \n \nE.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n35.  Tranche 1 is classified as category FI (financial intermediary) and treated as impact \ncategory C for all safeguards. Environmental impacts are anticipated to be insignificant and only \nland sites with no involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples' impacts will be considered. \nEach PCB will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) with screening \ncriteria and monitoring procedures to ensure that (i) subprojects have minimal or no adverse \nenvironmental or social risks; (ii) none of the housing sites have involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous peoples impacts; and (iii) all housing sites are (a) categorized as state-reserved \nlands and approved for residential use, and (b) certified as technically and environmentally \nappropriate for housing construction. Safeguard requirements for tranche 1 will also apply to all \nsubsequent tranches, with a due diligence assessment carried out annually to ensure that all \nnew houses and house lots financed by ADB are in compliance with ADB safeguards. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The program is classified as a medium risk project. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in Table 5, with details in the risk assessment and risk management plan. \n \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nAdverse selection of RHS  Well-defined RHS eligibility criteria and transparent selection process that \nhomebuyers  involves mahallas (citizen-based organizations) and the women\u2019s committee; \nbroad communication of criteria, routine monitoring, and social reporting. \nConflicts of interest between PCB  Closely regulated cost-based pricing and procurement processes (defined in \n(QQB) and construction supervisor  FAM);  annual  independent  technical  financial  audit  and  value-for-money \n(QQI which is a wholly owned  assessment. \nsubsidiary of QQB), and between  Mortgage loan proceeds will be directly deposited in homebuyer\u2019s account with \ndeveloper (QQI) and construction  withdrawal rights limited to the homebuyer.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  The government and QQB have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services and disbursement, as described in detail \nin  the  FAM  and  the  loan  documents. The government  and QQB  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific \ncovenants agreed by the government and PCBs with respect to individual tranches under the \nMFF are set forth in the loan agreement and the project agreement for the respective tranches. \nThe government agreed that loan effectiveness for tranche 1 is subject to (i) adoption of a \ngovernment resolution to approve the action plan for implementing the HIRDS for the period up \nto  2015  and  establishment  of  the  investment  program  implementation  unit,  and  (ii)  the \ngovernment  and  QQB  entering  into  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Housing  for \nIntegrated Rural Development Investment Program from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n9 August 2011\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and Indicators  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and Reporting \nwith Baselines  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  Average rural household formal income  Specialized  Assumptions \nRural communities have  increases from SUM373,650 in 2010 to at  project reports  Macroeconomic stability \nimproved living standards  least SUM816,769a in 2015  submitted by MOE  and growth continues on a \n  (executing  similar trajectory. \nAt least 75,000 rural construction jobs created \nagency) to ADB   \nannually from 2011 to 2015 \n(with annual  The government \n \nupdates of funds  implements MFF road \nAt least 450,000 rural MSE and home-based \nallocated for the  map actions and reforms \njobs created annually from 2010 to 2015 \n  investment  on a timely basis. \nAt least 40,800 RHS rural houses constructed  program and   \nwith access to improved utilities by 2015, up  investment  Risk \nfrom 7,647 in 2010 to 48,447 in 2015  program  Rural\u2013urban migration \n  outcomes  continues due to \nAt least 177 new or rehabilitated schools near \nachieved)  exogenous factors. \nRHS housing sites from 2011 to 2015 \n \nAt least 140 new or rehabilitated rural health \nclinics near RHS housing sites from 2011 to \n2015 \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved rural housing for  At least 95% of 40,800 new rural modern  Specialized  Demand for rural housing \ntargeted beneficiaries  homes under the RHS with access to basic  project reports  under RHS by targeted \nutilities owned and occupied by \u2015targeted\u2016  submitted by MOE  beneficiaries \nbeneficiaries (moderate- to low-income  to ADB \nhouseholds, young families, single-headed \nhouseholds, rural teachers, and health \nworkers) (of which 30% are women) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
