INTRODUCTION\n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been actively promoting economic cooperation in the\nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which consists of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n(Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province of the People\u2019s Republic of China\nsince 1992. The Third Ministerial Conference under the GMS initiative held in Hanoi in April 1994\nidentified malaria as a priority concern. The GMS Working Group meetings on Human Resources\nDevelopment recommended regional technical assistance (TA) to support the Roll Back Malaria\n(RBM) Initiative1 in the subregion through a coordinated approach to malaria control. Accordingly the\nTA2 seeks to assist the six GMS governments in their efforts to control malaria. The ADB Fact-Finding\nMission attended the meeting on the joint United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)/World Health\nOrganization (WHO) RBM Initiative in the GMS organized by WHO in Bali, Indonesia from 4 to 5 May\n2000  and  discussed  the  TA  framework  with  the  participating  countries,  UNICEF,  WHO,  and\ninternational RBM partners. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Malaria is the world\u2019s most important tropical parasitic disease; it kills more people than any\nother communicable disease except tuberculosis. Globally, malaria affects about 400 million people\nannually. In the GMS, about 35 million people or 15 percent of the GMS population live in endemic\nmalaria areas with inadequate vector control and are at high risk of malaria infection. According to\nWHO estimates, about 400,000 people suffer from clinical malaria each year, with over 20,000\ndeaths.  While  overall  malaria  incidence  has  declined  due  to  extensive  control  measures,  the\ndistribution of malaria is very uneven, with pockets of very high incidence among poor and isolated\ncommunities. These are mostly ethnic minorities and resettled people living in hilly border regions with\npoor infrastructure. They are particularly vulnerable to malaria epidemics, and their mobility often\nfacilitates the spread of the disease. Morbidity and mortality are particularly high among pregnant\nwomen, small children, and sick persons lacking immunity. Malaria during pregnancy causes severe\nanemia and low birth weight, and contributes to maternal deaths in endemic areas. Malaria is also a\nmajor cause of under-five child mortality and school absenteeism.\n3. In addition to human suffering, neglecting residual pockets of malaria where people are not\ntreated properly carries the risk of escalating the spread of multidrug-resistant malaria. Malaria also\nconstrains overall economic development causing immense losses of human capital, resulting in\npotential  social  implications.  At  the  household  level,  malaria  exacerbates  poverty  and  social\ninequality, increasing vulnerability and malaria burden. In endemic areas, malaria cases occupy about\n30 percent of hospital beds with an average 10-day stay. In agricultural areas, malaria severely\naffects productivity.  Research shows that malaria-affected families clear only about 40 percent3 of\ntheir land compared with healthy families. Children affected with malaria often miss or drop out of\nschool, and the disease can leave the child learning-impaired. Thus, effective malaria control would\nsignificantly increase economic productivity, education, and income of poor families, and enhance\ndevelopment capacity. Therefore, breaking the vicious circle is essential for improving quality of life,\nsupporting human development, reducing poverty, and accelerating growth and development.\n4. Prevention is the best protection from malaria. It includes individual protection such as the use\nof insecticide-treated bednets, mosquito repellants, and drug prophylaxis for pregnant women and\ninfants; and community measures such as the control of mosquito breading sites, insecticide spraying,\nand drainage. However, the poor and ethnic minorities living in remote areas lack the information and\n                                                          \n1  RBM Initiative \u2013 was initiated in 1999 by the six Mekong countries, Australian Agency for International Development,\nDepartment  for  International  Development,  European  Community,  United  Nations  Children  Fund,  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme, United States Agency for International Development, World Bank, World Health Organization,\nNGOs and research organizations as part of the global RBM mobilization to combat malaria.\n2  For $600,000, approved by Regional TA Screening Committee on 7 March 2000.\n3  WHO. 1998. Malaria, Fact Sheet No. 94, p, 3.", "2\nknowledge  to  protect  themselves  against  malaria.  The  knowledge  and  application  of  preventive\nmeasures is low. According to an ADB household survey in the Lao PDR, only 14 percent of the\npopulation use bednets. Community organizations are often not active in applying vector control\nmeasures. The key to disease management is early detection, and prompt and appropriate treatment.\nOnce malaria occurs, the symptoms will usually be recognized but people are reluctant to seek help in\nhealth facilities, which are often far away from the village and may lack drugs. In addition, travel to\nthese facilities involves substantial travel and opportunity costs. The uneducated often underestimate\nthe  risk  of  malaria  and  consequences  for  their  health  and  productivity,  and  are  often  not\nknowledgeable  about  self-treatment.  Effective  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)\ncampaigns are necessary to promote understanding of malaria transmission and motivate community-\nand family-based activities for malaria control and prevention.\n5. Within the Mekong RBM Initiative,4 WHO and UNICEF have defined a joint project. The goals\nof the Mekong RBM Initiative5 are to (i) reduce malaria mortality in the GMS by 50 percent by 2010\nrelative to 1998; and (ii) halt the progression of multidrug resistance. The Mekong RBM Initiative\nfocuses on major issues causing a high disease burden among the poor and vulnerable populations\nliving in remote and isolated areas, ethnic minority groups, and migrant workers. These issues include\nlack of information, unavailability of preventive measures, lack of basic treatment, and misuse of\nantimalarial drugs leading to multidrug resistance. Reasons why these services are lacking in the\nconcerned high-risk populations are well known, and include geographic conditions, cultural and\nlinguistic constraints, human resource imbalances, lack of political commitment, and managerial and\nfinancial  constraints.  In  addition,  coordination  of  institutions  and  countries  to  address  common\nproblems has been notoriously weak.\n6. The UNICEF/WHO joint RBM Initiative aims to address these issues through intensive, well-\ntargeted disease management and prevention activities, including special vector control efforts, the\npopularization of bednets in particular for children, surveillance and drug resistance monitoring, and\nbetter case management. WHO and UNICEF plan to support coordinated action from all stakeholders,\nin recognition of the need for mobilizing greater support. This entails a sector-wide approach to control\nmalaria based on generating political commitment; strengthening partnership; developing national\nprograms; and coordinating activities at regional, country, and district levels. The RBM initiative is\nestablishing  functioning  partnerships  with  a  range  of  organizations  at  regional,  country,  and\ninstitutional  levels  to  develop  a  sustained  capacity  to  address  malaria  and  other  vector-borne\ndiseases. WHO\u2019s main role is to provide strategic direction and catalyze actions. UNICEF plays a key\nrole  by  providing  support  to  malaria  control  efforts  of  the  governments  and  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs). Other external agencies are involved in surveillance, vector control, service\ndelivery, and training. ADB has been asked to support the community-based IEC activities, social\nmobilization, and advocacy. The results of two ongoing ADB studies will be used to develop more\nappropriate means of meeting the needs of disadvantaged people.6\n7. A key aim of the RBM Initiative is to develop effective IEC materials designed to meet the\nneeds of various populations for information about ways to prevent the spread of malaria and about\nproper treatment. The RBM Initiative also aims to mobilize support for IEC among the poor and ethnic\nminorities;  in  particular  those  living  in  isolated  and  border  areas.  Regional  collaboration  will  be\nbeneficial for developing effective IEC materials in the local language and recognizing local cultural\nbeliefs and practices. Because of the diversity of languages and ethnic groups, regional collaboration\nin each of these areas would be beneficial as ethnic groups sharing the same language and beliefs\noften live in two to four countries. Regional collaboration will also benefit national malaria control\n                                                          \n4  Statement by the Director General WHO in her speech at the fiftieth session of the WHO Regional Committee for the\nWestern Pacific, Macao, 17 September 1999.\n5  Comprising IEC and advocacy, insecticide treated bednets, diagnostic testing and antimalarial drugs, capacity building,\nnetworking and training, management and coordination, and surveillance, evaluation and research.\n6  TA 5794-REG: Study of Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities in the GMS, for $800,000, approved on 30 June\n1998 and TA 5881-REG: HIV/AIDS among Mobile Populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion, for $800,000, approved\non 16 December 1999.", "3\nprograms, which are not adequately organized and equipped to combat malaria among the isolated\npoor and ethnic minorities. Regional collaboration will provide an opportunity for GMS governments\nand other stakeholders to compare IEC programs and learn from each other\u2019s experiences. Regional\ncollaboration will raise awareness about the malaria problem and spur national malaria control efforts\nin the GMS.  Reaching ethnic minority groups and mobile migrants at remote, often transborder areas\nposes particular problems that can only be addressed regionally. Regional collaboration will facilitate\ndevelopment of IEC and social mobilization programs. A regional approach therefore offers potential\neconomies of scale and opportunities for comparative analysis and learning. ADB support for RBM\nwill help meet the human development and poverty reduction goals of the Subregional Economic\nCooperation Program in the GMS.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n8. The  overall  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  improve  the  health  status  of  poor  and  vulnerable\npopulation groups in the GMS by reducing morbidity and mortality due to malaria. The TA will support\nthe joint UNICEF/WHO RBM Project in the GMS, and has three objectives: (i) to develop user-friendly\nIEC materials and guidelines for poor and vulnerable population groups at high risk for malaria\ninfection; (ii) to enhance capacities of the governments in community-based activities in malaria\nprevention,  control,  and  treatment;  and  (iii)  to  make  national  malaria  control  programs  more\nresponsive to the needs of the target communities, particularly poor and vulnerable population by\nsupporting a common regional plan.\nB. Scope\n9. The  TA  objectives  will  be  achieved  through  a  coordinated  and  joint  effort  for  reviewing\navailable information, developing user-friendly IEC packages and guidelines, establishing common\nstrategy,  and  optimizing  existing  resources  to  strengthen  implementation  of  the  RBM  initiative.\nEmphasizing  community-based  activities,  the  TA  will  adopt  a  participatory  approach,  involving\ngovernments in the GMS, international RBM partners, NGOs, research institutions, and the target\nethnic minority communities and migrants. By mobilizing community members the TA aims to improve\nthe quality of life, particularly through poverty reduction and health care.\n10.   Situational Analysis. In the early phase, the TA team will review existing IEC materials and\nsituational analyses on the malaria burden; transmission, and focal issues; interpersonal activities;\nstakeholder analysis; and ways to organize malaria prevention, control, and treatment community-\nbased  activities.  Many  present  IEC  materials  are  often  outdated  in  content  as  well  as  in  form.\nAvailable data and research findings, including geographic information system in the GMS countries\nwill  be  used  to  identify  the  individual  and  community-level  characteristics\u2014dynamics,  location,\ndensity, organizations of the ethnic minority groups and migrants, and the environment, including\nvegetation and ecology as well as their high-risk behavioral patterns. Attention will be paid to gender-\nbased differences in risks and vulnerability. Based on the available examples on good practice, the\nTA team will develop community-friendly IEC packages and guidelines to support malaria prevention,\ncontrol, and treatment community-based activities under the joint RBM Initiative. The IEC packages\nand guidelines will be developed in consultation with stakeholders including the beneficiary groups,\ncommunity-based organizations, and related NGOs. The TA team will seek feedback and comments\nfrom the GMS governments, ADB, and the joint UNICEF/WHO RBM Initiative and the international\nRBM partners.\n11. Drafting and Field Testing of IEC Materials and Guidelines. The draft IEC materials and\nguidelines  will  be  field  tested  in  areas  with  large  concentrations  of  ethnic  minority  groups  and\nmigrants. The field test areas may include (i) agricultural, rubber, coffee, and fruit plantation workers;\n(ii) shifting farmers and gemstones miners; and (iii) loggers, security, and construction transborder\nmigrant workers. In each of the field tests, the impact of the intervention will be measured through", "4\nsurveys before and after testing. Provision of community-based services to ethnic minority groups and\nmigrants may encounter problems such as (i) poorly organized communities, (ii) wide variety of\ntraditional beliefs about malaria, and (iii) low literacy rates. Field tests will also provide information\nabout the cost and required administrative capacity for using the IEC packages and guidelines.\nExperience from each intervention will be documented and will be finalized for the GMS countries.\n12. Common Strategy for the GMS Countries. Based on the background research, field studies,\nand national malaria control programs, the TA team will develop a common strategy for community-\nbased  activities  in  areas  with  high  malaria  burden,  particularly  the  minority  ethnic  groups  and\nmigrants. The plan will include practical and feasible activities that can be done by the governments,\nNGOs, and international RBM partners: (i) IEC materials and interpersonal activities translated into\ndialects/languages spoken by the minority groups and migrants; (ii) training workshops organized for\nskills building for malaria control programs at regional and country levels; management capacity will\nbe  strengthened  for  malaria  programs  to  enhance  integration,  partner  coordination,  and\ndecentralization; (iii) training of provincial health staff for improved, integrated provincial supervision of\ndistricts, and development  of support networks for related fields, and execution of locally adapted\nmalaria control plans.\n13. Dissemination, Advocacy, and Streamlining of Common Strategy. In the final phase, the\ncommon strategy will be shared with the key policymakers and malaria control program managers to\nstreamline  with  the  national  programs.  The  governments\u2019  health  policies  will  ensure  sufficient\nresources allocated to the RBM Initiative. The IEC packages and guidelines including advocacy\nmessages will be shared with key government officials, NGOs, research institutions, the private\nsector, and the international RBM partners with the aim of establishing stronger health care delivery\nsystems in the GMS countries. A regional and national media alliance for the RBM Initiative in the\nGMS is needed to publicize the problems of malaria; foster and mobilize political, financial, and\ntechnical support; encourage social mobilization; and sustain enthusiasm. Dissemination workshops\nwill be held to improve the governments\u2019 and NGOs\u2019 capacity to organize malaria prevention and\ncontrol activities for ethnic minority groups and migrants. The workshop will also equip the participants\nwith skills that will help them refine and adapt the IEC materials and guidelines to their specific needs.\nIn collaboration, WHO and UNICEF will support the workshops, translation, and printing of the IEC\nmaterials  and  guidelines  into  local  dialects/languages.  The  findings  of  the  TA  will  also  be\ndisseminated through the internet, including NGOs and research institutions by supporting the web\nsite established by ACTMalaria. The experience of the TA will be shared and the regional plan for\nprevention of malaria among ethnic groups and migrants at transborder areas will be presented for\napproval at a GMS human resource development working group meeting.\n14. Social Mobilization. The TA team will develop IEC materials and guidelines for creating in-\ndepth awareness training of facilitators who will motivate communities in high-risk areas and establish\ncooperation for implementing activities of joint interest. Regular reports will be submitted to the joint\nUNICEF/WHO  RBM  Initiative  monitoring  team.  At  the  community  level,  activities  will  include  (i)\ntraining in prevention, control, and treatment activities; data collection; and improving preparedness\nduring  emergency  and  epidemics;  (ii)  mobilization  and  raising  awareness  of  malaria  prevention,\ncontrol, and treatment, and involving the community in planning and implementation of malaria control\nprograms; (iv) strengthening practices through IEC packages and guidelines, community support\nnetworks, skills building and traditional/mass media; and (vi) disseminating information on policy,\nstandards,  procurement, and distribution for impregnated bednets; and (v) monitoring and evaluating\ncommunity-based activities.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. This will cover the cost of\ninternational, regional, and domestic consulting services, international and domestic travel, surveys\nand  studies,  advocacy  campaigns,  production  of  IEC  packages  and  guidelines,  dissemination\nworkshops, and monitoring and consultation. ADB will provide $600,000 on a grant basis from the", "5\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. UNICEF will contribute $50,000 and WHO\nwill contribute $25,000. The participating GMS countries will contribute $75,000 in kind in terms of\npersonnel  for  the  steering  committee  and  dissemination  workshops.  The  cost  estimates  are  in\nAppendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n16. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA with technical guidance from WHO and UNICEF.\nA steering committee consisting of representatives from ADB, UNICEF, WHO, the governments of the\nparticipating DMCs, and the consultants will be established to provide overall guidance for the TA.\nThe steering committee will collaborate closely with the national coordinators for the ADB-assisted\nsubregional  economic  cooperation  program,  other  international  RBM  partners,  and  NGOs.  Each\nparticipating GMS country will designate focal points, normally in the ministry of health, for the\nimplementation of the TA. In each country, the local UNICEF and WHO offices will assist with TA\nimplementation.\n17. It  is  proposed  that  the  UNICEF  be  directly  appointed  as  the  consultant.  In  the  Joint\nUNICEF/WHO RBM in the GMS Project of which this TA will be a part, UNICEF contributes about 59\npercent of the total estimated cost of $10.2 million. UNICEF prioritizes affordable community-based\nmalaria prevention and treatment, and integrates community-based malaria programs with maternal\nand  child  health  services  and  other  health-promoting  community-based  programs.  UNICEF  has\nextensive experience with IEC, community mobilization, and advocacy, and assists GMS countries in\nmonitoring  malaria  problems  at  the  community  level.  The  TA  will  require  47  person-months  of\nconsulting services including three international consultants for a total of 30 person-months, with\nexperience in health information, education, and communication and one domestic consultant (17\nperson-months) with experience in management information systems. The experts will be selected\nand engaged by UNICEF, in consultation with ADB and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements on the engagement of consultants satisfactory to ADB.\nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.\n18. The TA will be implemented over about 24 months, from January 2001 to December 2002. An\ninception meeting will be held within four weeks after recruitment of the consultants by UNICEF.\nDuring the inception meeting, a detailed action plan will be developed for the conduct of the TA. The\nTA team leader will prepare a draft inception report within two weeks after the inception meeting. The\nreport will provide an action plan for TA implementation and the detailed mechanism for coordinating\nwith focal points in the participating governments, UNICEF, WHO, international RBM partners, and\nNGOs. The steering committee will organize a midterm review meeting in one of the participating\ncountries after the IEC materials and guidelines have been field tested and a draft common strategy\nprepared. The steering committee will provide comments on the draft common strategy for finalization.\nA third meeting may be held after all IEC materials are completed and the regional strategy prepared\nto review and evaluate the results of the TA and to formally adopt the regional strategy.\nIV.
