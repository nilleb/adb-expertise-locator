The proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to establish \nthe basis for the proposed investments and capacity building activities for the proposed project.  \n \n2.  The selection criteria include (i) economic and investment potentials; (ii) potentials for \ncross-border trade and presence of economic and industrial zones; (iii) potential for tourism \ndevelopment;  and  (iv)  for  public\u2012private  partnership  for  selected  public  investments.  The \nfollowing  towns  are  the  candidates  for  the  proposed  project,  confirmed  during  the  PPTA \nreconnaissance mission:  \n(i)  Cambodia: towns on the Central Corridor\u2012Sihanoukville and Kampot;1  \n(ii)  Lao PDR: towns on the North\u2012South Corridor\u2012Houayxay and Luang Namtha;2  \n(iii)  Viet Nam: towns on the Eastern Economic Corridor\u2012Sapa, Bac Giang, and Mong Cai.3 \n  \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.  For each of the corridor towns included in the PPTA, the principal outputs will include: (i) \nnational GMS Urban Development Strategies; 4  (ii) a strategic local economic development \nplan; 5 (iii) an infrastructure investment program for priority urban infrastructure; 6 and (iv) clearly \ndefined institutional arrangements and the necessary capacities to implement the strategic \ndevelopment plan and infrastructure investment program, and will offer opportunities for forging \nlearning partnerships for long-term sustainability. The PPTA will use the most appropriate low-\ncost technology options, compatible with other existing national policies, programs and projects, \nand  will  include  a  climate  change  vulnerability  assessment  to  look  at  impacts  of  extreme \nweather events and protection of critical and essential urban infrastructure for each town. The \nPPTA consultants will ensure that sector plans are integrated and that facilities are designed in \naccordance with realistic population and demand projections. Provision of services shall ensure \ninclusiveness,  and  the  project  may  be  designed  to  provide  subsidies  to  ensure  such \ninclusiveness of all beneficiaries. Infrastructure investments will be prioritized using appropriate \nprioritization tools for strategic investments. 7 \n \n4.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  These towns have been nominated by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), Cambodia. \n2  These towns have been nominated by the MPWT, Lao PDR. \n3  These towns have been nominated by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Viet Nam.  \n4  The  participating  countries  have  not  yet  addressed  the  specific  dimensions  GMS  corridors  in  their  urban \ndevelopment strategies. The urban dimension of regional cooperation and integration will require further attention. \nThe national GMS urban strategies will address climate and disaster resilience.   \n5   An SLEDP is a hybrid concept combining economic and spatial plans which gives emphasis to GMS-related \ndevelopment efforts.  \n6  Prefeasibility studies may also be undertaken for economic infrastructure investments such as land and water \ntransport terminals, market and trading centers, and transshipment or dry port facilities. \n7  The project is expected to be complementary to the proposed Second GMS Tourism Infrastructure for Inclusive \nGrowth Project, which mainly focuses on developing \u2018last-mile\u2019 infrastructure services to tourism sites, and the Lao \nPDR Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.  \n       ", "  Appendix 4  11 \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \n1.
