In  2011,  the  Government  of  the  Philippines,  through  the  Department  of  Labor  and \nEmployment  (DOLE),  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  improve \nemployment facilitation systems. Interventions were envisaged to support policy development, \nregulatory reviews, capacity development at public employment services offices (PESOs), and \ndesign and implementation of a pilot project assisting the school-to-work transition for at-risk \nyouths. At-risk youths are those who are out of school and not working, with at least some high-\nschool  education.  In  response,  ADB  conducted  consultation  missions  in  2011.  During  the \nNovember 2011 fact-finding mission, DOLE agreed on the proposed impact, outcome and \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of \nthe  technical  assistance  (TA)  as  described  in  the  approved  concept  paper.  Subsequent \nmeetings with DOLE, the PESOs, employee groups,  youth employment groups, and labor \norganizations provided additional background information that confirmed the need for the TA. \nADB conducted additional missions with DOLE and stakeholders to develop the project design. \nThe TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for the Philippines.1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 aims to create 1 million new jobs per year \nand to maintain the unemployment rate within a narrow range of 6.8%\u20137.2%. Central themes of \nthe  economic  program include  improving  the  business  climate  and  infrastructure  to  attract \ninvestment and create jobs, and implementing programs to improve youth skills and address the \nmismatch of skills in the labor market.  \n \n3.  While  higher  and  sustainable  economic  growth  is  necessary  to  create  more  jobs, \nstructural and policy impediments to employment generation must also be addressed. An ADB \nstudy of youth labor market experience found that high-school graduates are at-risk youths who \nhave the most difficulty integrating into the labor market.3 In particular, the transition from school \nto work for high-school graduates and dropouts is relatively slow. They may require up to 4 \nyears to find a wage job compared with 2 years for college graduates. Only 50.0% of high-\nschool graduates actually find wage employment, indicating many are excluded from productive \nemployment. The report also shows that the returns to education for high-school graduates are \nrelatively low\u2015college graduates earn 80.0% more than high-school graduates.   \n \n4.  Several  factors  contribute  to  the  slower  transition  to  the  workplace  for  high-school \ngraduates. First, economic growth averaging 5.0% per annum has not been adequate to create \nenough decent wage jobs for the 1 million new labor market entrants each year (economic \ngrowth above 6.0% is needed). Second, the labor market has been undergoing a structural \nchange with increased demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled and semi-skilled workers. \nThis change has resulted in a widening skills mismatch in the labor market. This is exacerbated \nby the education system, which appears to not properly equip at-risk youths with the requisite \ntechnical and life skills for entry into the labor market. Third, ADB staff analysis shows that \nsocioeconomic status also influences the transition, with the transition to the labor market for \nyoung persons most difficult if parents are working in the informal sector, indicating some \nimpediments to socioeconomic mobility of children from less well-off families. Fourth, public \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2013\u20132015.

Youth School-to-Work Transition: Are Filipino Youth off to a Good Start? Manila.  ", "2 \nprovisioning of employment services to help school graduates enter the labor market are in the \nearly stages of development and not well targeted. While the country has more 1,400 PESOs, \nless than 100 are institutionalized within local government units (LGUs), i.e., permanent offices \nwith staff and budget. Limited labor market information (LMI) is available to school graduates, \nand limited job search assistance programs are linked to vocational training and workplace \nexperience for recent high-school graduates. Fifth, some labor regulations have dampened \nemployment growth especially for the youth, such as restrictions on the length of probation \nperiods (maximum of 6 months), employment arrangements, and relatively higher severance \npay regulations. Minimum wages may have hurt employment opportunities for school dropouts.4 \n \n5.  DOLE is concerned about the slow school-to-work transition of youths and the quality of \nemployment opportunities for high-school graduates. Employers complain about the lack of \nworkplace readiness and skills mismatch of many school graduates entering the workplace. \nYouths complain about the lack of LMI and the availability of public services for employment \nadvice and career counseling. \n \n6.  The government is aware of these structural and policy constraints to youth employment \ncreation. In 2011, DOLE endorsed the Philippine Labor and Employment Plan, 2011\u20132016. The \nplan focuses on improving worker employability through cost-effective interventions that provide \nmarket-based incentives for hiring new workers, job searches, skills development, and income \nsecurity. It includes recommendations to (i) review and reform the Labor Code of the Philippines \nto better align it with recent developments in international labor policy and regulation with the \naim of boosting employment; (ii) adopt market-based incentives for income security, especially \nduring  periods  of  unemployment  or  employment  separation,  such  as  some  form  of \nunemployment  insurance;  (iii)  adopt  a  public\u2013private  partnership  framework  for  developing \nyouth employment programs; and (iv) create programs to mitigate labor market and income \nrisks to vulnerable workers.  \n \n7.  Aligned  with  the  Philippine  Labor  and  Employment  Plan  recommendation,  DOLE \ninitiated a youth employment pilot project\u2014MyFirstJob\u2014a DOLE flagship project. Following \nsuccessful models in Latin America, Canada, and Europe, MyFirstJob will provide employment \nassistance to help high-school graduates integrate into the workplace. Services will include \ncareer counseling and development of individual career plans and grants for vocational training \nlinked to workplace experience with private sector employers. In mid-2013, it will be tested in \nthe PESOs of four LGUs, targeting 1,600 youths, of which 50% will be female. If the pilot project \nis successful, it will be rolled out nationally. At the same time, DOLE will continue to advocate \nand  support  capacity  development  for  the  establishment  and  institutionalization  of  PESOs \nnationally. In line with promoting employment, DOLE has initiated a review of the labor code to \nachieve a balance between employment-friendly regulations and income security for workers.  \n \n8.  DOLE  is  coordinating  development  partner  support  for  the  Philippine  Labor  and \nEmployment  Plan,  including  ADB,  the  Government  of  Canada  (through  the  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency), and the International Labour Organization. Through this \ngovernment-led coordination, ADB is assisting DOLE in implementing selected components of \nits plan with a programmatic approach and TA (including this proposed TA project).5 Under \nsubprogram 1 of the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth  Program (ICIG), the \ngovernment set out the foundations for boosting employment through regulatory reform and \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2012.

", "3 \nstrengthening  employment  facilitation  systems,  including  capacity  development  for \ninstitutionalizing PESOs.6 Subprogram 2 of ICIG sets out prior expected actions (or policy \ntriggers) for supporting employment growth with the central focus on operationalizing reforms \nthrough pilot projects. These actions include implementation of a regulatory review of the labor \ncode, capacity development for the institutionalized PESOs, and implementation of MyFirstJob \nin four LGUs (through the PESOs). Subprogram 2 is expected to be submitted to the ADB \nBoard of Directors in 2014. The purpose of the proposed TA is to support operationalization of \nthese key interventions of the Philippine Labor and Employment Plan.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be enhanced employability of at-risk youths. This will be measured by  \n(i) youth wage employment increasing by 5.0% per annum over the long-term average rate of \n3.1% (1991\u20132008), (ii) job placement rate for youths using MyFirstJob services 20% higher than \nfor a similar group not receiving MyFirstJob services, and (iii) job placement rate for MyFirstJob \nyouths  in  jobs  offering  social  protection  benefits  20%  higher  than  for  a  similar  group  not \nreceiving  MyFirstJob  services.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  PESO  capacity  to  provide \nemployment services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Strengthened capacity for labor policy analysis and formulation. The TA \nwill strengthen the Institute for Labor Studies (ILS) and DOLE\u2019s policy development capacity to \nreview the labor code and conduct impact assessments of active labor market programs. Output \n1 will include (i) support for review and regulatory impact assessments (including stakeholder \nconsultations) of selected elements of the labor code and regulations in coordination with other \nrelevant bureaus of DOLE, (ii) support for development and management of the e-regulation \nwebsite  to  disseminate  information  on  proposed  regulatory  reforms  and  stakeholder \nconsultations; (iii) capacity development of DOLE staff for policy analysis, impact evaluation, \nand policy formulation with support from the international labor policy and regulatory expert and \nthrough short-term formal training in the Philippines and within Asia, and participation in regional \nand international conferences (policy development support will be built around the ILS research \nand policy development work plan for 2013\u20132016); (iv) capacity development of DOLE in policy \nframework development and labor market governance systems; (v) funding for field research of \nselected employment policy issues; (vi) funding to develop methodologies, field research for \nestablishing baseline data and tracing program recipients, and complete impact evaluation of \nselected labor and employment programs; (vii) development of standards for mitigating risks \nand  options  for  active  labor  market  and/or  employment  facilitation  programs;  and  \n(viii) development of protocols for an early employment recovery program.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Implementation of the MyFirstJob pilot project. This output is designed to \nenhance  the  employability  of  at-risk  youths  to  improve  their  integration  into  productive \nemployment. The medium-term objective will be to improve the capacity of DOLE and the \nBureau of Local Employment to deliver LMI and employment services. This will be achieved by \nsupporting the national LMI systems and the MyFirstJob pilot project, which aims to (i) improve \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2012.

Output 2 includes five main activities: \n \n(i)  Improve  PESO  access  to  LMI  and  its  use  by  counselors.  This  includes:  \n(a) developing an action plan to strengthen LMI systems nationally, and equip \nPESOs with hardware and software needed to access national and local LMI and \nmanage  job  vacancies;  (b) providing  training  for  counselors  in  labor  market \nanalysis;  (c)  preparing  counseling  materials  and  handouts  using  LMI;  and \n(d) improving the quality of services offered by job counselors. \n(ii)  Develop client assessment instruments. This includes (a) training counselors in \nassessment and counseling techniques, mentoring, and job search methods; and \n(b) training PESO managers in modern public employment services. \n(iii)  Reduce the mismatch of skills with employer needs. This includes (a) providing \nassessment  and  counseling  services  to  youths  based  on  LMI,  (b)  providing \ntraining in life skills to enhance work attitudes and behavior, (c) conducting youth \ntechnical  training  linked  to  current  labor  market  demand  through  a  voucher \nsystem, and (d) offering on-the-job training.  \n(iv)  Improve  the  approach  of  youths  for  job  searches.  This  includes  (a)  training \nyouths in job search techniques, and (b) strengthening PESO support for youths \nsearching for jobs. \n(v)  Develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the impact of the pilot \nproject on the labor market performance of participants. This includes completing \na  tracer  study  of  labor  performance  of  participants  (treatment  group)  and \nnonparticipants (control group). Labor market performance measures will include \nemployment placement rates, earnings, and potential for job displacement.  \n \n12.  Four PESOs will be chosen for the MyFirstJob pilot project and 1,600 youths will receive \nemployment services. Demand for the pilot project is expected to exceed the number of places \navailable; participants will be chosen by lottery to ensure random selection. A control group will \nbe created by lottery from those not admitted. The pilot project, using this random experimental \ndesign, will be implemented for 15 months, after which an impact evaluation will be carried out. \nThe impact of MyFirstJob on participants\u2019 job placement and performance will be assessed by \ncomparing those receiving services with those who do not. The results of the evaluation will be \nused in deciding a national rollout of MyFirstJob.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,591,897, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Canada and administered by ADB. 7 The Government of the Philippines will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n                                                \n7 CIDA grant of $ 5,500,000 Canadian dollars is equivalent to $ 5,591,897 using exchange rate as of 15 January \n2013.
