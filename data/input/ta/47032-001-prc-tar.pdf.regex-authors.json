At the request of the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) during the \ncountry programming mission in December 2012, technical assistance (TA) for strengthening \nmanagement capacity of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Hunan was \nincluded in the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) 2013 nonlending program. ADB fielded a TA \nreconnaissance mission in June 2013, during which agreement was reached with the Hunan \nEducation  Department  (HED)  on  the  TA's  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  costs  and  financing, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Strengthening  human  resources  by  developing  TVET  is  a  key  priority  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. In 2010, with approval of the National Long-\nTerm Strategy on Education, 2010\u20132020, the central government identified the expansion of \nTVET as the main way to build a more skilled workforce. A major challenge in this effort is to \nreform the TVET system so that it aligns more closely with the country\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment goals. \n \n3.  Hunan is a less-developed province in the south-central part of the PRC. It has a \npopulation  of  72  million.  The  province\u2019s  economy  is  being  transformed  by  the  central \ngovernment\u2019s    policy  of  economic  and  geographic  rebalancing,  which  seeks  to  expand \neconomic growth from the PRC\u2019s coastal regions toward its less-developed inland provinces \nand autonomous regions. This effort has led to Hunan\u2019s emergence as an important industrial \nbase that requires a large labor force with a wide range of skills. In 2011, demand for such \nskilled workers exceeded supply in Hunan, with manufacturing generating the greatest need. \nThe province needs to make its labor force more competitive and to foster skills-intensive \ngrowth that is driven by innovation. What is lacking in Hunan, however, is the capacity needed \nwithin the provincial government, its agencies, and the TVET system to fully implement the \nPRC\u2019s National Long-Term Strategy on Education.  \n \n4.  To develop a modern TVET system, the provincial government, the HED, and the TVET \ninstitutions and stakeholders need to be able to assess, assure, and certify the quality of the \nTVET being delivered in the province and to use these assessments to make improvements and \nalign the training and education provided with industry needs. The institutional capacity needed \nfor quality assurance is currently lacking, and guidelines for monitoring key indicators have to be \ndeveloped at the provincial level to measure the performance and promote the accountability of \nTVET institutions. Hunan pioneered skills assessment in the PRC in 2010 but needs to enhance \nits assessment methods and disseminate knowledge about skills testing across the province.  \n \n5.  Coastal  provinces  such  as  Guangdong  and  Jiangsu  and  the  centrally  administered \nmunicipality of Chongqing in the southwestern region have done more to reform TVET since the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan was announced in 2006 than the less-developed provinces in the \nPRC\u2019s western and central regions, where progress has been moderate. Ningbo City in Jiangsu \nProvince has developed and implemented the country\u2019s first regulatory framework for industry\u2013\nschool  partnerships  by  offering  tax  incentives  to  enterprises  that  participate  in  TVET, \nestablishing a board of governors to improve interagency coordination in TVET, setting up a \ntraining  fund,  and  expanding  on-the-job  training.  Chongqing  has  spearheaded  reforms  to \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 September 2013. \n ", "2   \nstrengthen quality improvement in TVET. Potential exists to replicate these good practices in \nHunan and elsewhere within the framework of a PRC government initiative to twin eastern and \nwestern provinces to facilitate the sharing of experience, lessons, and best practices in TVET \ndevelopment.  \n \n6.  The TA  aims to  strengthen the TVET  management  capacity  in  Hunan,  address  its \ncurrent weaknesses, and work toward achieving the goals of the provincial Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan.  \n \n7.  The  TA  will  (i)  develop  recommendations  for  strengthening  quality  improvement \nmechanisms at the TVET institution level; (ii) make recommendations for improving skills testing \nand certification, including the development of assessment standards in the priority fields of \nstudy;  (iii)  conduct  policy  research  and  present  recommendations  for  monitoring  key \nperformance indicators in TVET; and (iv) develop technical guidelines for establishing an east\u2013\nwest partnership in TVET between Hunan and an eastern province, including assessing and \ndefining  policy,  operational,  institutional,  and  technical  aspects  of  such  a  partnership. \nDocuments will be reviewed, detailed consultations with relevant stakeholders conducted, field \nvisits undertaken, and case studies examined to produce the TA outputs. \n \n8.  The TA will complement ADB's TVET demonstration project in Hunan by ensuring that \nthere will be strong management capacity building activities at a senior management level in the \nHED, TVET institutions, and relevant industry advisory groups as the demonstration undertaking \ngoes forward.2 The TA will gather and consolidate information about national developments in \nTVET in the PRC, and the TA findings will be disseminated at the provincial and national levels \nthrough workshops and policy briefs. This capacity building through information dissemination \nfor senior management officials will be essential for strengthening ownership of the initiatives \nunder the demonstration project to improve TVET\u2013industry linkages and match TVET programs \nwith market demand. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be strengthened capacity of the government and other stakeholders for \nmanaging the TVET system in Hunan Province. The outcome of the TA will be improved TVET \nmanagement in Hunan through consideration by HED of the recommendations and guidelines \nprepared by the TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outcome will be achieved through five outputs:  \n \n(i)  a review of the institution-level TVET quality assurance system in Hunan; \n(ii)  technical  guidelines  for  strengthening  an  institution-level  TVET  quality \nimprovement framework; \n(iii)  recommendations for improving skills testing and certification in the priority fields \nof study, including development of assessment standards; \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Hunan Technical and Vocational Education and Training Demonstration Project. \nManila (approved on 28 June). \n \n ", "  3 \n(iv)  technical guidelines for an east\u2013west partnership in TVET; and \n(v)  recommendations on how to monitor key performance indicators in TVET. \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 18 months. During the 2 months of \nphase 1, the consulting firm engaged under the TA will review, analyze, and report on the \npresent status of TVET policies and practices in the province, particularly regarding quality \nassurance, testing, and certification. Outlines of technical guidelines will then be prepared for           \n(i) making improvements at the institution-level in the quality of skills testing and certification,                 \n(ii) monitoring of key performance indicators, and (iii) establishing an east\u2013west partnership. \nThe outlines will be disseminated to stakeholders. Activities under phase 1 will include \n \n(i)  reviewing the current TVET quality assurance practices in Hunan and in the PRC, \nincluding identification of (a) institutional constraints and opportunities, and (b) \nnational best practice in TVET quality assurance mechanisms; \n(ii)  reviewing  the  current  skills  testing  and  certification  frameworks  in  Hunan, \nincluding assessment methodologies in the priority fields of study in Hunan; \n(iii)  reviewing the current practice of monitoring key performance indicators in Hunan; \n(iv)  preparing outlines of technical guidelines for the selected items; and \n(v)  organizing a workshop for relevant stakeholders at the end of phase 1 to discuss \nthe outline technical guidelines.  \n \n12.  During phase 2 (9 months), the outlines produced in phase 1 will be developed into draft \ntechnical guidelines that will be pilot tested and validated in two or three TVET institutions. In \nparallel,  international  and  national  study  tours  to  selected  ADB  member  countries  will  be \norganized for five or six government staff members to familiarize them with best practices in \nTVET management and governance for their future guidance.  The phase 2 activities will \ninclude \n \n(i)  the drafting of technical guidelines for the institution-level quality improvement \nsystem,  an  east\u2013west  partnership,  and  the  monitoring  of  key  performance \nindicators (based on the outlines developed in phase 1); \n(ii)  the development of a draft quality improvement manual for institution-level TVET \nquality improvement; \n(iii)  the identification of two or three TVET institutions where the draft guidelines for \nthe institution-level quality improvement system can be pilot tested and validated; \n(iv)  the  development  and  presentation  of  recommendations  for  further  improving \nskills testing and certification;  \n(v)  the  organization  of  a  multistakeholder  workshop  to  present  and  discuss  the \nfindings of the field validation and the  resulting policy recommendations, and to \nfinalize the draft technical guidelines; and \n(vi)  identification  of  the  partner  institutions  for  the  study  tours,  development  of \nrational  criteria  for  selecting  up  to  five  or  six  government  staff  members  to \nparticipate in the study tours, and organization and implementation of the tours. \n \n13.  Phase 3 will take 7 months and involve the finalization of the draft technical guidelines to \nbe submitted to the HED for the quality improvement system, the skills testing and certification, \nthe monitoring of key performance indicators, and the east\u2013west partnership. A knowledge \ndissemination strategy will be developed and implemented, a provincial workshop to share \nfindings and experiences will be conducted, and a policy note on best practices will be prepared \nas a knowledge product.  \n \n ", "4   \n14.  Achievement  of  the  TA  objectives  assumes  that  (i)  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments will continue to make TVET development a priority, (ii) high-level authorities within \nthe HED will regard and support the TA as a priority project, (iii) the provincial authorities will \nprovide timely guidance during TA implementation, (iv) the HED will agree to and implement the \nTA recommendations effectively, and (v) the local authorities and pilot TVET institutions will \ncooperate fully in pilot testing activities. \n \n15.  The major risks to successful implementation are (i) inadequate or delayed provision of \nnecessary  data  by  key  respondents,  (ii)  delayed  submission  of  required  information  by \ncounterpart individuals and institutions, (iii) inadequate performance of the consultants, (iv) poor \ncoordination between the HED and other relevant agencies, (v) inadequate involvement of \nindustry representatives, and (vi) ineffective dissemination of the TA findings and outputs by the \nHED. The HED has agreed to provide all necessary data in a timely manner, as well as \nadequate counterpart support. Close coordination between the consultants, the HED, and ADB, \nin consultation with the project steering committee (PSC), will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The HED will provide  \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  remuneration  and  per  diem  of \ncounterpart  staff,  materials,  maps,  data,  and  documents  required  for  the  TA,  domestic \ntransportation (city transport), miscellaneous administration and support costs (including the \ncost  of  utilities  for  the  use  of  the  consultants),  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency for the TA will be the HED, which is responsible for developing \nprovincial policies and guidelines for TVET development. The HED is also the implementing \nagency for the ADB-funded lending project for TVET demonstration in Hunan (footnote 2). This \nwill ensure that the outputs of the TA will complement the  loan project. The PSC will be \nestablished by the HED and be chaired by the director of the TVET division of the HED. PSC \nmembers  will  include  representatives  from  the  relevant  divisions  of  the  HED,  the  Hunan \nDepartment of Science and Technology, and the Hunan Department of Human Resources and \nSocial Security. \n \n18.  The TA will finance consulting services, workshops, training, and field work costs. The \nconsultants will provide expertise in (i) TVET quality assurance, (ii) skills testing and certification, \n(iii) TVET performance monitoring and accountability, and (iv) east\u2013west partnership in the PRC. \nA total of 26 person-months of consulting services will be required (7 international and 19 \nnational).  The  HED  will  authorize  and  convene  the  workshops  and  training,  which  the \nconsultants will organize and administer. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are \nin Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB through a firm in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) under the quality- \nand cost-based selection method, based on the quality of the proposal (80%) and the cost (20%) \nof the services to be provided and using the simplified technical proposal procedure. \n \n19.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The HED has \n ", "  5 \nexperience in implementing TA projects financed by international development partners and has \nan adequate accounting records-keeping system. TA disbursement will be handled by ADB. \n \n20.  It is envisaged that the TA implementation will commence on or about 1 February 2014 \nand be completed 18 months thereafter, on or about 31 July 2015. The TA will be monitored \nthrough the use of project specific indicators and targets. These will include indicators to monitor \nthe timely implementation of the TA. Policy dialogue will be maintained with the government, \nand  ADB  will  take  up  project-specific  issues  with  government  counterparts  during  review \nmissions. Technical milestones will be monitored by inception, midterm, and final reports to be \nprepared  by  the  consultants.  Milestones  related  to  TA  implementation  will  be  monitored \nregularly by the consultant team leader and the ADB task manager. \n \n21.  Good  practices  and  lessons  learned  from  this  TA  will  be  disseminated  through \ncontinuous policy dialogue, TA workshops, and knowledge products. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining Management Capacity Building in Hunan, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data  Sources and  \n  and Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nStrengthened capacity of  The number of  Annual provincial  The national and provincial \nthe government and other  workers in Hunan\u2019s  reports and statistics  governments continue \nstakeholders to manage  labor force (mid- and  priority for TVET \nthe TVET system in  higher-level workers  development. \nHunan Province   and technicians) with   \nformal TVET  High-level authorities within \nqualifications  the HED consider \nincreases by 30%  implementation of the TA a \nfrom 2013 to 2023  priority. \n(baseline to be   \ndetermined through  The HED will agree to and \nbaseline studies in  implement the TA \n2013)  recommendations and \nguidelines effectively. \nOutcome      Risks \n       \nImproved TVET  Main policy  Annual reports from  Coordination between the \nmanagement in Hunan  recommendations and  HED  HED and other relevant \nthrough consideration by  guidelines are    government agencies is \nHED of the  submitted to the HED  Sector analysis and  poor. \nrecommendations and  on (i) east-west  evaluation by other   \nguidelines prepared by  partnership in TVET,  stakeholders,  Industry representatives \nthe TA  (ii) monitoring of key  including ADB  are not sufficiently involved \n  performance    in TA implementation. \nindicators, (iii) draft  TA completion report   \ninstitution-level TVET   \nquality improvement \nframework, and (iv) \nskills testing for 3 \npriority fields of study. \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.
