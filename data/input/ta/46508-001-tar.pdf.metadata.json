INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Solomon Islands requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve access to and suitability of financial services to promote \neconomic  opportunities  in  rural  areas.1 The  TA  will  (i)  increase  the  availability  of  suitable \nfinancial services and lessen financing constraints for selected smallholder farmers and small \nrural  businesses,  (ii)  promote  financial  literacy  and  capacity,  and  (iii)  safeguard  consumer \ninterests in branchless banking. This is consistent with the government\u2019s national development \nstrategy  priority  to  alleviate  poverty  and  improve  the  population\u2019s  livelihoods.2 It  is  also \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach  and  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Solomon \nIslands, and is included in the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017.3 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA fact-finding mission concluded with a memorandum of understanding outlining \nagreed impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference \nfor  consultants.  The  TA  was  discussed  with  the  private  sector;  development  partners; \ngovernment agencies; the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI); and the National Financial \nInclusion Taskforce (NFIT), which the CBSI governor chairs.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Solomon Islands comprises six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds of \nislets and atolls. More than 80% of the 553,000 population live in widely dispersed villages of \nseveral hundred people.4 Geographic dispersion and remoteness are major challenges that \nmake  service  delivery  costly.  As  a  result,  most  rural  dwellers  lack  access  to  health  and \neducation services, and markets. Transport services in rural areas and between outer islands \nare limited, and financial services are available only in urban and provincial centers. \n \n4.  Solomon Islands is characterized as a fragile state. Poverty is widespread with low \naverage income (gross domestic product per capita was $1,636.16 in 2013)5 and unequal \nincome distribution, particularly in rural areas. The economy is based on primary commodities \nfrom  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing,  and  there  are  few  alternative  income-earning \nopportunities, especially in rural areas.6 The rural population depends on subsistence farming \nfor their livelihoods and most rural households engage in agriculture. For example, coconut \nproduction is one of the most important activities in Solomon Islands for subsistence as well as \nfor the cash economy. However, production for sale is still considerably low, and agriculture \nvalue  chains  remain  underdeveloped,  even  though  having  substantial  potential  for  growth. \nValue chain analyses have concluded that coconuts and cocoa, among other cash crops, could \nprovide income-earning opportunities for a large segment of the rural population.7  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 September 2014. \n2  Government of Solomon Islands. 2011.

There is increasing evidence that there are potential economic gains for all stakeholders \nin agriculture value chains once constraints are removed.8 The key constraints to realizing those \nopportunities  are  (i)  lack  of  linkages  between  buyers  and  sellers  of  produce;  (ii)  poor \ninfrastructure and transport to markets; (iii) the rural population\u2019s lack of knowledge about and \naccess to suitable and affordable financial services for safely depositing savings and making \npayments; (iv) insufficient information or credit history, which impedes access to loans for \nbusiness expansion for small and medium-sized enterprises; (v) low literacy and numeracy in \nrural  areas;  and  (vi)  the  limited  technical  capacities  and  entrepreneurial  experience  of \nsmallholder farmers. Additionally, women who participate in agricultural production receive little \nbenefit due to institutional and social constraints as they have less control of land and access to \npersonal assets. \n \n6.  Removing the constraints within selected value chains would help promote economic \nopportunities in rural areas. Programs such as the World Bank\u2019s Rural Development Program, \nPhase II9 and the Government of Australia-funded Pacific Horticulture and Agriculture Market \nAccess Program10 address some of the constraints by providing extension services, promoting \npartnerships between smallholders and wholesalers, and establishing market access channels. \nADB supports transport and infrastructure development.11 It also supports improvements to the \nenabling environment for businesses, including through secured transactions reform, which \nallows people to use moveable assets as collateral for securing loans.12  \n7.  But,  so  far,  the  rural  population  and  small  and  medium-sized  agribusinesses  have \nlargely been unable to access these loans or other financial services. In 2007, only 15% of the \nmostly urban-based Solomon Islands population could access formal financial services.13 With \nthe launch of the CBSI\u2019s 2010 National Financial Inclusion Strategy and the introduction of \nbranchless banking models, local accounts increased by 50% and the rollout is slowly reaching \nrural areas.14 However, the number and volume of transactions are still low.15 Low volumes can \nbe attributed to the fact that most rural clients are first-time users of financial services and have \ninadequate understanding of the new technologies employed in branchless banking (i.e., the \nuse of digital devices rather than traditional paper passbooks). Low literacy and numeracy rates \namong rural residents further contribute to this problem.16 In addition, smallholders require not \nonly financing but also other types of financial services (e.g., savings, payment, and insurance) \nsuitable for their income and expenses pattern. \n                                                \n8  International Finance Corporation. 2012.

Commercial bank loans to the agriculture sector accounted for only 2.8% of the total \nloan volume.17 Banks view financing of agriculture value chain stakeholders as unprofitable \nbecause of perceived risks in the sector and lack of acceptable collateral.18 They therefore shy \naway from providing financial services, in particular credit, to smallholders and agribusinesses. \nTypically, collateral in excess of 175% is required to secure a loan.19 So far, the range of \nsuitable financial products for value chain stakeholders, especially in rural areas, is limited. \n \n9.  Recent  improvements  in  mobile  phone  penetration  and  network  coverage  allow  for \nexpanded branchless banking models and less-costly financial services, including cashless \ncommodity  sales  payments  and  potential  credit  delivery  through  mobile  channels.  This \ncontributes  to  a  broader  digital  ecosystem  connecting  key  participants  in  a  value  chain, \nincluding smallholders, commodity buyers, the finance sector, and network operators.20 \n \n10.  However, the rollout of branchless banking models creates risks that may undermine \nfinance sector integrity and inhibit consumer use.21 For example, banks typically outsource their \nfinancial service delivery22 to agents, such as trade stores and mobile phone shops, who may \nbe unskilled in transacting with clients.23 The use of agents also leapfrogs the step of interacting \nwith a bank branch and makes integrating the previously unbanked into the formal financial \nsystem more challenging. Relationships among clients, banks, and bank agents need to be \nreinforced  to  ensure  that  (i)  all  players  are  informed,  and  their  interests  and  money  are \nprotected; (ii) their business models are sustainable; and (iii) ultimately finance sector stability is \nsafeguarded. To support this, the CBSI needs to promote consumer awareness and create \nbranchless banking guidelines and policies, not yet in place. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be smallholder farmers in two provinces participate in the cash economy. \nThe outcome will be selected smallholder farmers in two provinces use financial services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases and will focus on three output areas: (i) \nselected smallholder farmers in two provinces have improved knowledge on financial issues; (ii) \nselected smallholder farmers, including coconut value chain stakeholders, are provided with \nadequate financial services; and (iii) consumer interests related to branchless banking models \nare safeguarded. \n \n13.  During phase 1, needs assessments, analyses, and surveys will be carried out with \nsmallholders and other stakeholders to design financial education methods and tools that will (i) \n                                                \n17  CBSI. 2013.

Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 7430-REG). \n22 This refers to cash-in and cash-out transactions, simple deposit services, and transfers. \n23 For example, the risk of cash management is transferred to the agent. There is anecdotal evidence of agents using \ncustomers\u2019 PINs to make fraudulent transactions. \n ", "4   \npromote  greater  awareness  of  financial  issues  (e.g.,  household  budgeting  and  business \naccounting) and financial services; and (ii) use innovative and cost-efficient technologies (e.g., \nmobile phones as delivery channels) to have greater impact and the potential for replication. \nUsing a value chain analysis, the demand and financial service needs of smallholder farmers \nand other stakeholders within a selected agriculture value chain will be identified. Initially, the \ncoconut value chain will be used.24  \n14.  Provinces for the assessments and subsequent piloting will be selected based on the \npresence of (i) a significant number of households engaged in cash crop production;25 (ii) \nworkable  transport  infrastructure  to  bring  produce  to  market;  (iii)  an  existing  operational \nbranchless banking model; and (iv) sufficient support from stakeholders for the pilot. During this \nphase, workshops will be held with the CBSI to assess knowledge on emerging issues and risks \nof branchless banking from a regulator perspective to ensure sustainable implementation of the \nbranchless  banking  rollout  and  eventual  interconnectivity  of  different  branchless  banking \nmodels.26 The CBSI-administered guarantee scheme will be reviewed and adjusted to facilitate \nrisk-sharing in banks\u2019 lending to the agriculture sector.27 \n \n15.  The findings of phase 1 will inform the design and implementation of phase 2. This will \nensure  that  products  and  systems  are  designed  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  value  chain \nstakeholders and communities in the pilot area, are specific to the country context, and provide \nan opportunity for broader ecosystem development. Upon agreement with stakeholders on the \nrecommendations, phase 2 will be piloted in the same two provinces. The results of the pilot will \nbe shared with stakeholders for replication in other provinces. \n \n16.  During  phase  2,  the  financial  education  modules  will  be  implemented.  Innovative \nfinancial products will be developed with financial services providers for the same smallholder \nfarmers group and small and medium-sized enterprises in the coconut agriculture value chain.28 \nIt is envisaged that these products will be provided through a branchless banking modality.29 \nPairing financial education with increased access to financial services is crucial and is more \nlikely  to  result  in  a  behavioral  change.  Phase  2  will  also  support  the  establishment  or \nenforcement of linkages between value chain actors. \n \n17.  The TA will continue to work with the CBSI in phase 2 to achieve consensus within the \nfinancial services industry on the risks of branchless banking, such as agent risk and liquidity \nmanagement. If this results in required regulatory changes, then further support will be provided \nthrough the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V), and $400,000 will be financed on \n                                                \n24 Most households are involved in coconut production. The World Bank\u2019s coconut value chain analysis identified that \nthere are potentially greater economic opportunities than currently exploited. Other value chains will be analyzed, if \nTA resources allow. \n25 After the selection of provinces, community members will be chosen in consultation with provincial governments. \n26 These workshops will be coordinated with the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI). \n27 The CBSI administers a guarantee scheme that shares up to 90% of the lending risk with banks. All banks can \napply to participate in the scheme, but it is currently not being used. \n28 The PSDI is exploring options for making secured transactions reform available and affordable for small loans. \n29 If financial credit products are developed, collaboration with the PSDI will ensure that moveable agricultural assets \ncan be used under the secured transaction reform framework, giving lenders additional comfort. \n ", "  5 \na grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.30 The government \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of office space for consultants, as necessary; some \ngovernment staff time; workshop facilities; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The CBSI will be the executing and implementing agency. In its capacity as chair of the \nNFIT, the CBSI will arrange and coordinate meetings to discuss the findings and results of \nphase 1 and agree with ADB and stakeholders on moving to phase 2. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from 30 October 2014 to 29 October 2017, \nwith phase 1 estimated to take 12 months, and phase 2 estimated to take 24 months. It is \nanticipated that a total of 30 person-months of intermittent international and national consulting \nservices will be required to implement the TA. For phase 1, an estimate of 9.5 person-months \n(8.5  person-months  international  and  1  person-month  national,  intermittent)  of  consulting \nservices will be needed. The consulting services input for phase 2 is unallocated and will be \ndetermined after phase 1 once the findings and recommendations for implementation have \nbeen discussed and agreed with the stakeholders.  \n21.  Consultants will be recruited on an individual basis under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Output-based contracts will be considered, \nas appropriate. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Training or \nseminars will be arranged by consultants. Cost-sharing partnership arrangements with financial \ninstitutions and nongovernment organizations can be considered for the financial education \ncomponent, as well as field-level service delivery contracts with universities and think tanks, for \nassessments and analysis. Staff can be used as sector, thematic, or technical experts and \nresource persons. Their travel-related expenses will be paid through the TA.31 The TA proceeds \nwill be disbursed in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  TA progress will be monitored against the activities, outputs, and outcome as described \nin the design and monitoring framework. ADB will assist the government in sharing all results, \ngood practices, and lessons through reports, meetings and seminars as well as CBSI and ADB \nwebsites. This includes the meetings of the NFIT, and more broadly the Central Banks\u2019 Pacific \nIslands  Working  Group,  as  well  as  brown  bag  seminars  through  ADB\u2019s  finance  sector \ndevelopment community of practice.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund, and \n(ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Solomon Islands for Strengthening Financial Inclusion, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n30 Established by ADB.
