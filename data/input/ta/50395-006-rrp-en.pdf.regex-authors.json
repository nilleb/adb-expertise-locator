THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Advanced Knowledge and Skills for Sustainable Growth Project.  \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  support  advanced  skills  and  knowledge  for  sustainable \neconomic growth in Indonesia by upgrading three public universities in Sumatra and one public \nuniversity in Bandung, West Java, as the first phase of higher-education reform. The project will \nsupport the construction and/or upgrading of new facilities that incorporate green-building and \nclimate-proofing design features. The project will strengthen staff capacity at the universities and \nsupport demand-driven quality education and research aligned with local economic priorities. It \nwill integrate new technologies in teaching programs, strengthen technical and vocational teacher \neducation, and help the government develop a medium-term higher-education investment plan. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. The government seeks to accelerate economic growth by promoting \ntechnology-intensive  industries,  infrastructure  development,  and  high-end  services,  while \ntransforming agriculture and fisheries. Indonesia\u2019s manufacturing industry aims to grow and \nintegrate new technologies to increase productivity. New technologies such as big data, robotics, \nand the internet of things will transform the economy, and can create new industries and better-\nquality jobs, and thus, increase labor productivity. However, these new technologies will alter the \nskills required of the workforce, leading to lower wage growth for less-skilled laborers, or even \nloss of employment to automation, thereby exacerbating income inequality. Already, demand for \njobs that require non-routine cognitive tasks have grown faster than jobs requiring routine and \nmanual tasks. Without adequate skills development or retraining, workers with weaker skills face \nhurdles in seizing the opportunities that new technologies provide. As of end-2017, only 11% of \nthe labor force had completed higher education, and in 2017 fewer than 20% of graduates held \ndegrees in technology-relevant fields like engineering\u2014with few women among them. Half of the \nlabor force is underqualified for the jobs they are performing. About 10% of the labor force is \noverqualified, most of whom hold degrees, indicating an increasing risk of mismatch between \ndemand  and  supply.  Indonesia  needs  more  higher-education  graduates\u2014both  men  and \nwomen\u2014with degrees that better match emerging opportunities in the labor market.1 \n \n4.  Higher education needs to accommodate an increasing volume of students. The \ngross rate of enrollment in higher education increased from 17% in 2004 to 31% in 2018, with \nstudent numbers increasing from 4.0 million to 7.5 million.2 Advanced skills education is provided \nby higher-education institutions (HEIs) such as universities and polytechnics. The Ministry of \nResearch, Technology and Higher Education (MORTHE) administers public HEIs and licenses \nprivate HEIs.3 From 2004 to 2018, the number of students per public HEI grew significantly, \nF\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017. Manila; ADB. 2018. Asian Development \nOutlook 2018. Manila; and ADB. 2018. Indonesia: Enhancing Productivity through Quality Jobs. Manila. The \nunemployment rate for higher-education graduates in 2017 was 8.7%, a slight decrease from 9.9% in 2016. \n2  Women enrollment in higher education is 50.2%. Women enroll less in engineering and more in education and health. \nWomen face difficulties finding formal employment and are paid less than equally educated men for comparable jobs. \n3  Nine years of basic education and three years of general and vocational secondary education is under the auspices of \nthe Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), with administration of schools decentralized to districts and provinces. \nEducation with more extensive religious content is provided by education institutions under the Ministry of Religious \n \n ", "2 \nresulting in very crowded institutions. During the same period the number of private HEIs grew \nsignificantly to accommodate more students. While Indonesia has made significant progress in \nproviding access to higher education, additional effort is needed to meet growing public demand. \n \n5.  Education and research in higher-education institutions do not meet current and \nfuture industry needs. Indonesia\u2019s labor force is underqualified. Employers indicate that higher- \neducation graduates lack reasoning, problem solving, and teamwork skills. Curricula need to \nfocus more on practical and soft skills like communication, teamwork, and work ethic, and should \nbe updated more regularly. With a few notable exceptions, HEIs do not benefit from links to \nindustry and rely for the most part on traditional lectures. Teachers lack the skills to adopt modern \nteaching techniques that integrate practical skills training with theoretical content. Few HEI staff \nhave doctoral degrees. Moreover, the sharp increase in enrollment has led public HEIs to recruit \nmore temporary, less-qualified staff and to focus mainly on education and neglecting research. \nPublic HEIs are often overcrowded and have outdated and/or inadequate equipment, lecture \nhalls, and laboratories. \n \n6.  Higher-education institutions outside Java need to improve to support local society \nand the economy. Of Indonesia\u2019s 122 public HEIs, 40% are in Java, and so are nine of \nIndonesia\u2019s top-10 public universities. HEIs outside Java cater to poorer parts of the country. They \nare rated lower in quality, have limited financial resources, fewer qualified staff, and hardly \nconduct any research. With adequate investment in facilities and human resources, the HEIs \noutside Java can play an important role in the local economy. They can provide the advanced \nskills needed for inclusive economic growth, collaborate with local industry to introduce new \ntechnologies, and enable a more diverse array of students to attend high-quality universities. \n \n7.  Higher education needs to provide better teachers to meet growing demand for \ntechnical  education.  Senior  secondary  vocational  education  (SMK)  students  are  not  as \nemployable as they should be, and thus the quality and relevance of SMK education needs to \nimprove.4 Teachers at SMK schools and HEIs lack the practical skills and industry experience \nneeded for the technical subjects they teach. They rely mainly on traditional lectures, instead of \nusing more interactive, inquiry-based teaching methods.5 Employment rules for teachers focus \non academic qualifications, which hampers recruitment of teachers with practical experience. \nOnly 20% of SMK vocational subject teachers have the required qualifications, implying that \n90,000 of such teachers require skills improvement. Teaching universities and institutions lack \nadequate  programs,  facilities,  and  industry  linkages,  and  are  ill-prepared  to  integrate  new \ntechnologies to prepare teachers for the changing needs of technical education. Indonesia \nurgently requires better SMK teachers, as the number of SMKs and students has increased \nsignificantly since 2012.6 In response, the MORTHE and the Ministry of Education and Culture \n(MOEC) have introduced programs to strengthen teacher education. This includes changing \n                                                \nAffairs. Private providers enroll 73% of Indonesia\u2019s 7.6 million HEI students and manage 90% of the 4,150 HEIs. The \nMORTHE oversees 122 public and 3,152 private HEIs. The 96 public and 1,019 private HEIs overseen by the Ministry \nof Religious Affairs enroll 700,000 students. The four project-supported universities are public institutions under the \nMORTHE. Private HEIs tend not to offer expensive courses, like engineering. \n4  68% of SMK graduates are employed\u201479% of men and 52% of women. \n5  SMKs provide high school diplomas in technical education; HEIs provide diplomas and degrees in technical subjects. \n6  SMKs teach general and vocational subjects. The general senior secondary schools teach general academic \nsubjects. In 2017, SMKs enrolled 50.7% (4.7 million) of senior secondary students, overtaking general senior \nsecondary enrollment for the first time. The number of SMK schools grew from 10,670 in 2012 to 13,710 in 2017. \nIndonesia prioritized teachers. From 2003 to 2015, 30% more teachers were employed compared with 25% more \nstudents. The share of teachers with the minimum bachelor\u2019s degree increased from 37% in 2003 to 90% in 2016. \nQuality of teachers remains an issue; when tested on a 100-point scale, average result was 53. \n \n ", "3 \nemployment rules to allow people with industry backgrounds to become teachers. Given the \nurgent need for more and better technical-and-vocational-education-and-training (TVET) teachers, \nthe MORTHE and MOEC are preparing a strategy to educate TVET teachers, which includes \nintegrating pre- and in-service training and increasing industry involvement.7 \n \n8.  Efforts to improve quality and relevance need to become more effective. The higher \neducation quality assurance mechanism and the Indonesian qualification framework (IQF) are the \ntwo main instruments to improve the quality and relevance of higher education. HEIs also operate \ntheir own internal quality assurance systems. An independent panel is in charge of assessing and \naccrediting HEIs at the program level and at the institution level. From 2019, the national \naccreditation body for higher education will introduce an improved instrument to assess HEIs at \nthe institution level. The new instrument will focus on performance and processes.8 Under the \nIQF,  which  came  into  effect  in  2012,  national  qualification  standards  for  occupations  are \ndeveloped with inputs from industry to ensure that the education and training institutions provide \nskills development which meets industry needs. The IQF is meant to be the unifying framework \nfor skills development. While progress has been made, the system needs to be strengthened so \nthat IQF certificates issued under the national assessment and accreditation system become \nnationally\u2014and possibly internationally\u2014accepted.9 \n \n9.  The government\u2019s strategy. Higher education is a priority for the government. The \nNational Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019, the MORTHE\u2019s strategy for 2015\u20132019, \nand the presidential decree on strengthening vocational education set out the directions to \nimprove the quality and relevance of higher education.10 The government will focus on improving \naccess to and the quality of science, engineering, agriculture, and health education and research; \nestablishing  stronger  collaboration  with  industry;  and  strengthening  teacher  quality.  The \nMORTHE\u2019s investment program aims to strengthen the capacity of HEIs to meet increased \ndemand for higher education. HEIs outside Java are included in the investment to ensure \nequitable growth. The MORTHE expects each university to become a center of excellence in a \nspecific academic discipline to meet current and future (local) economic needs. The government \nis preparing its National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024, with a strong focus on the \nrole of higher education to support technological change, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As \npart of the 2020\u20132024 plan, the MORTHE will prepare a medium-term investment plan for higher \neducation. This investment plan will aim to accelerate innovation in new technology and stimulate \nentrepreneurship at top universities, and will also target the development of advanced skills at \nregional universities so local economies can also benefit from the technological transformation. \n \n10.  Financing requirements for upgrading higher-education institutions. Since 2010, the \ngovernment has allocated 20% of the national budget to education, with the MORTHE receiving \nabout 10% of the education budget. This includes revenue that public universities gain from tuition \nand other resources. However, this budget is insufficient to upgrade facilities to offer quality \n                                                \n7  Pre-service teacher education is the responsibility of the MORTHE. Core policies are the Vocational Higher Education \nRevitalization Program (2016) and the Teacher Training Institution Revitalization Strategy (2016). In-service training of \nSMK teachers is the responsibility of the MOEC, including retraining 90,000 teachers trained to teach the general \nsubjects in SMKs into vocational subject teachers (footnote 6). \n8  This updated instrument will be used in the project universities to measure progress in quality of education. \n9  As of 2018, about 40% of Indonesia\u2019s 160 industry associations have professional certification bodies attached. \nThose bodies have developed 1,720 qualification schemes, of which only about 13% can be properly labeled \nqualification standards (the others need to be improved). \n10 Government of Indonesia, National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2015.

Hence, development partners are financing the HEI \nupgrades.11 As  part  of  the  initiative,  the  MORTHE  has  requested  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to upgrade four public universities: the University of Malikussaleh \n(UNIMAL), the University of Jambi (UNJA), and the University of Riau (UNRI) all in Sumatra; and \nthe Indonesia University of Education (UPI) in Bandung, West Java. \n \n11.  The Sumatran universities are mid-tier universities providing higher education to support \neconomic development in their regions. Financing is needed to provide lecture halls, laboratories, \nand other facilities to meet increased demand for higher education, improve quality and relevance \nof education and research, and ensure an inclusive, conducive, and gender-friendly teaching and \nlearning environment. UNIMAL caters mainly to students from East Aceh, a post-conflict and post-\ntsunami area in which agriculture is the main economic activity. It will focus on sustainable \nagriculture to support local farmers and small agribusiness. UNJA, the only public university in \npoor but natural-resources-rich Jambi Province, will focus on sustainable management of natural \nresources to support the province\u2019s transformation from an extractive to a sustainable economy. \nUNRI, located in Riau Province, which has seen strong economic growth, aims to strengthen its \ncapacity in aquatic and marine science to accommodate agribusiness companies, related service \nindustries, and farmers.12 \n \n12.  UPI, a teaching university, will become a center of excellence for educating TVET teachers. \nThe center will prepare TVET teachers to teach emerging technologies to meet current and future \nindustry needs. The center will collaborate with other universities that specialize in TVET-teacher \neducation; with other HEIs in Bandung; and with SMKs, the MORTHE, and the MOEC. UPI will \nestablish a special unit to strengthen industry relationships within the center of excellence. \n \n13.  Lessons  learned.  The  project  design  incorporated  lessons  learned  from  the  ADB-\nsupported Polytechnic Education Development Project and the Education Sector Analytical and \nCapacity Development Partnership. First, programs designed by industry and individual HEIs \ngenerally produce better results. Second, to reform an institution, a piece meal approach focusing \nat a few programs is not sustainable. The design should address all stakeholders and units within \nan organization, and ensure interconnectivity between these units so reforms reinforce each other \nand sustain. Third, education institutions should design their skills development programs based \non the skills needs of the local industry, as each location and each industry is unique.13 \n.\n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: increased income and productivity of the \nworking age population.14 The project will have the following outcome: strengthened access, \nrelevance, and quality of targeted universities.15 \n                                                \n11 The Islamic Development Bank, the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (Germany), and the Japan International \nCooperation Agency also support the upgrade of universities.

The project will achieve its outcome through two outputs: (i) market-responsive programs \ndelivered (Output 1), and (ii) training of TVET teachers improved (Output 2). \n \n16.  Output 1: Market-responsive programs delivered. This output will increase access to \nhigher  education  by  expanding  and  improving  the  physical  capacity  of  the  three  targeted \nuniversities in Sumatra: UNIMAL, UNJA, and UNRI. The project will support construction of new \nlecture halls, laboratories, and other buildings with climate-proofing design features, and will \nsupport the completion of one unfinished building at UNIMAL. Construction of this building was \nnot completed due to shortage of financing. All facilities constructed and/or upgraded will be \ngender-responsive, inclusive, and sustainable. Each university will construct or upgrade new day-\ncare centers, lactation rooms, and related facilities. To improve the quality of higher education, \nthe capacity of university staff will be strengthened through international and national training, \ninternships, and joint research projects. To improve the relevance of higher education, UNJA, \nUNIMAL, and UNRI will establish centers of excellence in, respectively, sustainable natural \nresources, sustainable agriculture, and marine and aquatic science in collaboration with industry, \ncommunity,  and  other  stakeholders.  Each  center  will  work  closely  with  local  industry  and \ncommunities to identify how they can address local economic needs. For example, UNIMAL is in \ndialogue with local industry on developing new seeds and better fertilizer. UNJA aims the use of \nnew sustainable land management methods like agroforestry. UNRI is focusing on modernizing \napplied food technology for local industry. A separate technical assistance (TA) is proposed to \nsupport the MORTHE with the medium-term higher-education investment plan development as \ncalled for in the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024 (para. 9).16 \n \n17.  Output  2:  Training  of  technical-and-vocational-education-and-training  teachers \nimproved. This output will improve the quality of technical education by turning UPI into a center \nof excellence for the education of TVET teachers. Civil works will include classrooms, laboratories, \na day care center, and other academic buildings. All constructed and upgraded facilities will be \ngender-responsive,  inclusive,  and  sustainable.  The  capacity  of  university  staff  will  be \nstrengthened. The center of excellence will establish bachelor\u2019s-level TVET-teacher-education \nprograms related to six emerging technologies (i) information systems and technology, including \nbig data; (ii) artificial intelligence and robotics; (iii) industrial instrumentation engineering; (iv) \nrenewable energy engineering; (v) chemical engineering; and (vi) automotive engineering. As part \nof its TVET education research, UPI will develop new models for TVET education, focusing on \nimproved industry collaboration, resource sharing, and introduction of new teaching\u2013learning \npractices.  UPI  will  develop  and  implement  in-service  SMK  teacher  training  programs  in \ncollaboration with the MOEC, polytechnics, SMKs, and industry. UPI will become a professional \ncertification body and a center for competency testing, able to provide IQF certificates. To address \nthe need for more and better TVET teachers , the proposed separate TA will support the MORTHE \nand MOEC to develop a medium-term strategy to educate TVET teachers (footnote 16). \n \n18.  ADB added value. In addition to financing, ADB will add value by building links to industry \nin research and education. ADB will emphasize new technologies to improve relevance of \neducation and research.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The project design incorporates measures to mitigate risks related to climate change, \npollution, and natural disasters. These measures include detailed engineering designs to address \nincreased temperatures, and they meet or exceed earthquake codes, energy efficiency, and \nminimal-waste  concept.  Project  designers  have  also  modified  campus  designs  to  address \nseasonal flooding and to mitigate potential water shortages. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13%, which is \nabove the 6% threshold for social sector projects. The principal benefits considered in the analysis \nwere wages for graduates across different scenarios. Wages for SMK students benefitting from \nimproved TVET teachers were also examined. The principal costs are civil works, equipment, \nopportunity cost of attending universities (wages to be earned by secondary-education graduates \nand out-of-pocket expenses), replacement of laboratory equipment, and recurrent costs including \nsalary and maintenance. Analysis shows that the overall investment would remain economically \nviable in a range of contexts, including a 10% capital cost overrun and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n26.  Financial sustainability. The four universities are financed through an annual budget \nthat includes nontax revenue from tuition and other income, and central government budget from \ntax revenue. The central government and the universities have committed adequate counterpart \nfinancing during implementation. Financing for post-implementation is expected to be sustainable. \nThe government\u2019s commitment to allocate at least 20% of the budget to education will ensure that \nthe allocation is stable. Improving tax collection is a government priority and will minimize the risk \nthat overall revenue increases too slowly to accommodate the post-implementation requirement \nfrom the central budget. Nontax revenue is expected to increase due to growth in student numbers \nand research activities.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate. The MORTHE and \nthe universities have adequate financial management systems in place and have experience with \nimplementing  externally funded  projects,  although  they  do  not  have experience  with  ADB-\nfinanced projects. Delays in receiving budget allocations are possible as the annual allocation for \nall loan financing is capped. Delays can also occur because of the differing legal status of the \nuniversities, which forces them to use different financial management procedures. However, ADB, \nMORTHE, and the universities can mitigate these risks through close monitoring of expenditures, \nbudget planning, prudent project planning, capacity development, and consultant support. \n \n28.  Procurement. The procurement capacity assessment concluded that the MORTHE and \nthe four universities have the capacity to carry out the project, subject to the enforcement of \nfiduciary controls and timely decision making by the procurement committees in the universities. \nTo strengthen procurement capacity, ADB and consultants will provide in-country support, advice, \nand training for the project management unit (PMU) and project implementation unit (PIU). The \nPMU will perform quality assurance to ensure that procurement complies with ADB guidelines \nand is carried out in a timely manner. An experienced procurement consultant will strengthen the \nPMU to coordinate and provide additional technical support and monitoring of the PIUs. All \nprocurement of works, goods, and services will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \n ", "9 \namended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). \n \n29.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MORTHE. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  As the government provides scholarship programs, more poor and disadvantaged youth \nare enrolling in higher education. Improved market orientation of programs, better TVET teachers \nin relevant subject areas, and increased enrollment will reduce youth unemployment. More \nwomen enroll in the four universities than men. However, transition to the labor market is more \nchallenging for women in some disciplines. The project is categorized as gender equity theme, \nand a gender action plan has been prepared.20 The project will ensure (i) integration of gender-\nresponsive physical design features into the construction of facilities in the universities (new day-\ncare centers, separate and special-needs toilets, and safe and accessible buildings); (ii) fair \nparticipation of male and female staff in capacity development programs; (iii) conducting gender \nanalysis and research with the university gender study centers; and (iv) training of TVET teacher \ninstructors in gender-responsive and gender-inclusive teaching and learning methods. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.21  \n \n32.  Environment (category B). The project will develop lecture rooms, teaching laboratories, \nand other academic facilities across seven campuses of four universities. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was prepared and disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and the applicable national environment requirements.22 The universities carried out \nmeaningful consultations with stakeholders, including residents, university staff, students, and \npublic and private local agencies. The IEE identifies environmental impacts and mitigation \nmeasures for construction and operations with regard to (i) waste management, (ii) air quality and \nnoise, and (iii) occupational and community health and safety. The project is category B as \nenvironmental impacts are location-specific, can be readily mitigated, and the locations are not \necologically sensitive or high risk with respect to community health and safety. The PMU and \nPIUs will undertake environmental management and monitoring during implementation. The IEE \nproposes (i) capacity building for the PMU and PIUs, including consultant support; (ii) inclusion of \nan environmental management plan in bidding documents; and (iii) inspection and supervision \nduring construction. At the detailed engineering design stage, the PMU will update the IEE to \nreflect the detailed design and national approval requirements and seek ADB approval. The PMU \nwill ensure effective environmental monitoring at all stages of project implementation. University \nmanagement, supported by PIUs, and the PMU will be responsible for any grievances. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). All universities will use land already within their \ncampuses. Involuntary resettlement as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement is not triggered. \n                                                \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) includes environmental \naudit for one unfinished building to be completed under the project. \n ", "10 \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous people live within the project area. \nTherefore, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement is not triggered. \n \nF.
