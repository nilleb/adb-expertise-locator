The Project will have four components: (i) establish \noperational school clusters as a network that covers all schools in \nUzbekistan, and equip 860 cluster leader schools (CLSs) with ICT \nfacilities and internet/intranet connectivity (the CLSs will provide \nessential pedagogical and technical support for effective ICT use \nin other schools in the clusters, including those in poor, rural, and \nremote areas); (ii) train staff for effective ICT use in schools, and \nimprove the existing in-service teacher training system to make it \nmore flexible and effective for training for ICT use across the \ncurriculum; (iii) develop learning materials for ICT use; and (iv) \nprovide advisory services on technical, financial, and fiscal issues \nto  the  Government  to  strengthen  sustainability  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ICT  in  basic  education  policy,  and  pilot  test \napproaches designed to enhance project sustainability and future \nICT development with a pro-poor focus. \n   \nRationale  In recognition of the potential gains offered by ICT to (i) improve \nthe quality of education, (ii) strengthen the relevance of education \nto an increasingly information- and knowledge-based society and \nchanging  labor  market  needs,  and  (iii)  improve  access  to \neducation for children from poor families and in remote areas, the \nGovernment prepared a national strategy for ICT development in \n2002. The strategy provides a general framework and identifies \nbasic  education  as  a  priority  sector  for  implementation.  In \naccordance with this strategy, and within the framework of the \nNational Program for Basic Education Development approved in \n2004, the Government has launched an ambitious program to \nintegrate ICT in schools nationwide. The Government considers \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  as  essential  in \nimplementing  its  ICT  in  basic  education  program.  ADB  has \nassisted  the  Government  in  preparing  a  national  strategy  for \nintegrating ICT in schools, to which the Project is anchored.  \n   ", "iv   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is the improved quality and relevance of, \nand equitable access to basic education for all students, including \nstudents in poor and remote areas. The outcome of the Project is \nthe improvement of learning outcomes through ICT use in priority \nsubject areas in grades 5\u20139 in project schools with a pro-poor \nfocus.  The  priority  subject  areas  are  mathematics,  sciences, \nhistory, and languages, in addition to informatics. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $43.0  million \nequivalent, including physical and price contingencies, taxes and \nduties, and interest and other charges. Of the total cost, $26.1 \nmillion  (61%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  16.9 \nmillion equivalent (39%) the local currency cost.  \n   \nFinancing Plan             ($ million equivalent) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  25.1  4.9  30.0  70\nGovernment  1.0  12.0  13.0  30\n          Total  26.1  16.9  43.0  100\n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n20,408,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided. \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June  2011 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2010  \n   \nImplementation   The Project will integrate its management with that of ongoing \nArrangements   projects  in  basic  education  to  reduce  transaction  costs  and \nmaximize  economic  efficiency  in  project  implementation.  In \nparticular, the project steering committee (PSC) will be integrated \nwith the PSCs for the two ongoing ADB projects with the Ministry \nof Public Education (MOPE): the Education Sector Development \nProgram (ESDP), and the Second Textbook Development Project \n(STDP). Members of the existing PSCs include representatives of \nthe  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  MOPE,  and  Ministry  of  Finance. \nParticipation may be adjusted to meet the needs of the Project. \nThe PSC will also consider appointing the project director for the \nESDP and STDP as the project director for the Project. Given \nMOPE\u2019s  experience  with  ADB  project  implementation, \naccumulated since 1998, and the recent successful completion of \nthe  Basic  Education  Textbook  Development  Project,  financial \nmanagement  arrangements  of  MOPE  are  satisfactory  for \npurposes of implementation of the Project.  ", "  v\n  The project implementation unit (PIU) will be responsible for day-\nto-day  management  of  the  Project  including  procurement  and \nrecruitment;  staff  development;  finance  and  accounting; \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  and  preparation  of  detailed  project \nimplementation plans and annual and quarterly progress reports \nfor submission to the PSC, the project director, and ADB. The PIU \nwill  have  6\u20138  full-time  staff  with  expertise  in  these  areas.  To \nensure  timely  start-up  of  project  implementation,  MOPE  will \nappoint a project manager, who will be responsible for day-to-day \ncoordination of project activities. The PIU will be established in \naccordance  with  a  government  decision  related  to  the \nestablishment and financing of this PIU, which will be covered by \nretroactive financing (para. 57). The PIU will be established in the \nsame premises as the ESDP and STDP PIUs, and will coordinate \nclosely with them across PIU functions, including sharing of staff \nwhere feasible. Eventual consideration will be given to measures \nto further harmonize project management. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Public Education  \n   \nProcurement  The Project will procure (i) standard packages of ICT hardware \nand peripherals, and related furniture and other equipment for 860 \nCLSs;  (ii)  non-personal-computer-based  learning  materials  and \nequipment  including  audiovisual  sets;  and  (iii)  furniture  and \ncomputers for office and administrative use. ADB loan-financed \ngoods and services will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Procurement  of  largest  value  will  be  for  ICT \nhardware,  which  may  be  broken  into  several  packages  each \nlarger  than  $1  million  to  allow  proper  sequencing  of  ICT \ninstallation in schools. Goods and services will be procured by \ninternational competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more \nthan $1 million equivalent, or by international shopping where the \ncost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to  $1  million  equivalent.  Direct \npurchase may be applicable for goods and services valued at less \nthan  $100,000  equivalent.  Procurement  of  furniture  and  the \ndevelopment of software and e-materials valued at less than $0.5 \nmillion  per  contract  may  follow  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The Government will finance and \nundertake necessary civil works, in particular to rehabilitate and \nupgrade computer classrooms. Minimum criteria to be met by a \nschool prior to installation of ICT equipment have been agreed.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 212 person-months of consulting services, \nconsisting  of  52.5  person-months  of  international  and  159.5 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting.  Areas  of  expertise \nrequired include education reform and decentralization, software \ndevelopment,  ICT  in  basic  education,  training,  continuous \nprofessional  development  (CPD),  school  networking,  and  pilot \nproject  design  and  evaluation.  International  consultants  will  be \nengaged through a firm in association with domestic consultants \nusing quality and cost-based selection with full technical proposals \n ", "vi   \n  in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nPIU  staff  will  be  recruited  separately  using  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.   \n                    \nProject Benefits and  The direct benefit of applying ICT across the curriculum will be a \nBeneficiaries  fundamental  shift  to  student-centered  learning  and  teaching \nmethodologies. This will lead to improved student performance in \npriority subject areas, and enhanced skills and competencies as \nopposed to the accumulation of factual knowledge. ICT use will \nmotivate  students  and  teachers  by  making  education  more \nrelevant.  These  combined  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \noverall  system  to  produce  graduates  with  the  ability  to  meet \nworking  life  challenges  in  the  21st  century  with  increasingly \nadvanced skills in information access, management, processing, \nand usage. The Project will significantly improve the effectiveness \nof  the  CPD  system  for  teachers.  The  establishment  of  school \nclusters and the close working conditions required between the \nexisting  teaching  training  institutions  and  the  CLSs  to  be \nestablished under the Project will make the content of CPD more \nrelevant and its delivery more effective. The Project will also lay \nthe foundation for the planned second phase of ICT development \nafter 2010.  \n   \nThe Project will directly benefit 540,000 students in grades 5\u20139 in \nthe  860  CLSs  through  the  improved  learning  and  teaching \nconditions resulting from the provision and application of ICT in \nclassrooms. Direct beneficiaries will also include 7,740 teachers in \nCLSs,  63,200  teachers  in  non-CLSs,  1,720  CLS  school \nmanagement staff, 17,800 management staff in non-CLSs, 220 \nteacher trainers, and 600 local language e-materials developers, \nwhose skills will be improved by the targeted training under the \nProject. Given the proposed central role of the CLSs in the school \nsystem, all students and teachers in the basic education system \nwill benefit from the Project. This will amount to about 6 million \nstudents and 200,000 teachers during 2006\u20132010. Finally, over 1 \nmillion households are estimated to be able to benefit from ICT \nuse  when  schools  open  their  ICT  facilities  to  access  in  their \ncommunities. The Project will benefit the poor disproportionately \nas about 70% of CLSs are in poor, rural, and remote areas; the \nProject will provide the disadvantaged with equitable access to \ninformation from the internet/intranet as well as pedagogical and \ntechnical support for effective ICT use.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project faces three major types of risks. The first are risks \nrelated to adoption of new technology. Using ICT in schools is \nnew; over 50% of schools have never had access to computers. \nThe risks of inadequate and inappropriate use of ICT as well as \nmismanagement  of  the facilities will  be  high. These risks  will be \n ", "  vii\n  mitigated by extensive capacity building for teachers and school \nmanagement  to  ensure  intended  use  and  impact  of  ICT  in \nschools.   \n \nThe second are infrastructure and logistical risks. For the effective \nuse of ICT in schools, the Project will require a number of basic \ninfrastructure  and  logistical  conditions  to  be  met,  including \nappropriate classroom facilities with security arrangements, power \nsupply,  internet/intranet  connectivity,  and  services  and \nmaintenance. These concerns are addressed through covenanted \nassurances.  \n \nThe third are financial sustainability risks. Throughout the design \nof the Project, the financial implications of the integration of ICT \nhave been carefully reviewed and extensive consultations held \nwith  the  Government  to  ensure  that  the  Project  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  plans  for  integrating  ICT  in  basic  education  are \nfinancially  sustainable.  The  Project  addresses  these  concerns \nthrough (i) covenants on adequate and timely budget provision for \noperation and maintenance and replacement costs; (ii) piloting of \nlow  cost  hardware  configurations;  and  (iii)  a  strong  focus  on \nfinancial  sustainability  during  project  reviews,  including  the \nmidterm review.  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n ", "60o  00'E 69o  00'E\nUZBEKISTAN\nKAZAKHSTAN\nINFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN\nBASIC EDUCATION PROJECT\n45 o 00'N Aral  Sea N 45 o 00'N\n0 50 100 150\nKilometers\nMuynak\nKungrad\nKARAKALPAKSTAN\nKhodzheyli\nNukus NAVOI\nAm Uchkuduk KAZAKHSTAN\nudarya R.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Information and Communications Technology in Basic \nEducation Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  According to the Constitution of Uzbekistan, all citizens are entitled to basic education. \nProvided by the public sector, basic education starts at age 6/7 and comprises grades 1\u20139 with \nan additional 2 years of high school in grades 10 and 11. This 11-year system is due to be \nphased out by 2010 when it will be replaced by a 12-year system, which will be compulsory. The \n12-year system will provide 3 years of senior secondary education after grade 9 either in \nacademic  lyceums  or  in  technically  and  vocationally  oriented  professional  colleges.  The \nrestructuring of basic and senior secondary education has been a focus of sector reforms since \n1997. Higher education consists of a 4-year first degree program followed by a 2-year masters \nprogram and then a doctoral program. Information on the basic education system is in Appendix \n2.  \n \n3.  In 2003/04 about 6.1 million students were enrolled in basic education. With a net \nenrolment  rate  estimated  at  over  98%  and  no  significant  gender  differentials  in  primary \neducation,  Uzbekistan  scores  high  on  the  two  Millennium  Development  Goals  relevant  to \neducation. However, the level of attendance is reported to be a problem especially in poor \nregions, although reliable data is not available. The primary completion rate is estimated to be \nclose to 100%. Over the next 5 years basic education enrolment is expected to decrease due to \n(i)  the  transfer  of  approximately  600,000  grade  10  and  11  students  to  senior  secondary \neducation as the system moves to a 12-year system; and (ii) a decline in new enrolments in \ngrade 1 of approximately 10,000\u201320,000 students per year resulting from falling birth rates and \nan aging population. Enrolments are expected to stabilize in 2010 at around 5.3 million in \ngrades 1\u20139. In 2004, 20.7% of the 9,757 general secondary schools were located in urban \nareas. Approximately 40% of basic education enrolments are in grades 1\u20134.  \n \n4.  Public expenditure for education as a high priority sector has increased in real terms \nevery year since 2000, and stood at 9.5% of gross domestic product in 2005. The share of basic \neducation in total education expenditure has gone up from 45.5% to 50.3% over the past 5 \nyears, and is expected to rise further. Since 2004 the Government has accelerated efforts to \nrefocus on basic education and to remedy many years of underfunding of the subsector. The \nNational Program for Basic Education Development 2004\u20132009 was launched in 2004 with the \nkey objective to urgently rehabilitate and upgrade the basic education system especially in rural \nareas, including physical plants, learning and teaching materials, computers, laboratory and \nsports equipment, and curriculum reform.  \n \n5.  According  to  the  national  strategy  for  ICT  development  introduced  in  2002,  basic \neducation is a priority area for the development of information and communications technology \n(ICT).1  In  2004  only  18%  of  general  secondary  schools  had  access  to  modern  personal \ncomputers and just 50% of schools had access to any form of computers including those made \n                                                 \n1  Cabinet of Ministers, Uzbekistan. Resolution 30 May 2002. On Further Development of Computerization and \nIntroduction of Information and Communication Technologies.  ", "2 \nin  the  Soviet  era.  Within  the  framework  of  the  National  Program  for  Basic  Education \nDevelopment, the Government has launched a program to integrate ICT in basic education, with \nthe provision of a 14+1 computer suite2 to every school in the country by 2009 and of internet \nconnectivity to 35% of schools.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  Integrating ICT in basic education is an integral part of the Government\u2019s long-term \nstrategic objective of transforming the education system into one consistent with a market-\nbased  economy  in  the  21st  century.  While  ICT  promises  substantial  potential  gains,  a \ndiscussion of a number of key challenges follows.  \n \n1.  Benefits of ICT Development in Basic Education   \n \n7.  To meet the needs of the 21st century, which is increasingly knowledge and information \nbased, basic education must produce graduates who can learn quickly and independently to \nensure that the future workforce is sufficiently flexible to be able to apply old skills in new \nsituations, and to acquire new skills and knowledge quickly when needed. Integrating ICT in \nschools will help to achieve this fundamental educational objective in the following five areas.  \n  \n8.  Ensuring Computer Competence as an Essential Basic Skill. ICT capability involves \ntechnical  and  cognitive  proficiency  to  access,  use,  develop,  create,  and  communicate \ninformation appropriately using ICT tools. Improved computer skills with basic ICT tools (word \nprocessing, spreadsheets, databases, presentation software, and other applications) increase \nstudent productivity; ICT skills are becoming a universal basic requirement. Currently, such \nskills are not learned in schools, as more than half of students have no excess to computers, \nand for those who do, computers are used only for theoretical informatics.  \n \n9.  Promoting  Student-Centered  Learning  to  Improve  Learner  Engagement  and \nMotivation. ICT will support the change to student-centered learning, which is at the center of \nongoing reforms in basic education. Despite years of efforts, didactic teaching methodologies \nand teacher-directed classrooms still dominate. A key advantage of ICT is to give students\u2014\ntraditionally  on  the  passive  receiving  end\u2014access  to  an  effective  means  of  acquiring, \nprocessing, and applying knowledge and information. Students enjoy using ICT because it \nprovides alternative and user-friendly approaches to learning and the chance to develop the \nskills needed for the future. ICT facilitates students learning in groups, working with other \nlearners, being creative, learning through challenging game-like activities, and setting clear \npersonal  learning  goals.  ICT  use  also  stimulates  increased  teacher-student  interaction.  As \nstudents develop skills, they become more engaged with their own learning and thus more \nmotivated. With ICT the curriculum can be tailored to a student\u2019s individual learning needs and \ncan be readily adapted to meet the needs of students with learning or physical disabilities.  \n \n10.  Developing Higher Order Thinking Skills and Independent Learning Skills. ICT \nhelps students to discriminate in their use of information and ICT tools, and to be appreciative \nand understanding of the role of ICT in learning. ICT allows students to investigate the real \nworld more thoroughly, using up-to-date information and tools to build a broader and deeper \nknowledge base, and at the same time requires from learners higher levels of thinking and \n                                                 \n2  This will give a computer student ratio of 1:42 on the current enrolment of 6.1 million. According to a Cabinet of \nMinisters\u2019 decree dated 21 October 2004, the Government plans to supply computers to about 8,700 schools \nduring 2005\u20132009, with the total number of computers supplied ranging from 100,000 to 140,000.  ", "3 \nproblem  solving.  ICT  tools  can  be  used  to  support  application,  analysis,  synthesis,  and \nassessment  of  progress.  As  students  develop  their  own  independent  learning  styles,  they \nunderstand how they learn best and are well-prepared to become lifelong learners. They can \nseek information quickly and efficiently, and apply it in ways that are suitable to each new \nlearning and employment context. \n \n11.  Enhancing Educational Attainment. With ICT, learners demonstrate improved skills \nand  understanding  by  applying  technology  purposefully  to  solve  problems,  analyze  and \nexchange information, develop ideas, create models, and control devices. Evidence shows that \nappropriately  used,  ICT  improves  learning  outcomes  through  enhanced  motivation  from \nstudents and teachers. As appropriate software is developed and applied in more subject areas, \nsuch enhanced attainment will become more widespread. Access to the internet offers sources \nof  e-learning  materials  to  improve  students\u2019  background  knowledge  and  understanding  of \ncurriculum subjects. The effective implementation of an ICT strategy will provide a learning \nmanagement system, which can finely discriminate the nature of students\u2019 learning needs and \nprovide effective learning pathways to meet the needs of students of all abilities.   \n \n12.  Contributing  to  the  Development  of  the  Knowledge  Economy.  ICT  capability  is \nmuch broader than acquiring a set of technical competencies in software applications. The most \nimportant feature in students\u2019 use of ICT is their capacity to understand how the technology can \nsolve problems and enable them to explore new dimensions of understanding. Successful \nplayers in the global economy are able to use technology to make productivity gains in existing \nindustries and to maximize return on the new knowledge-based sectors. Over the long term, the \nUzbek economy will increasingly need a highly educated and skilled workforce that can apply \nICT  to  solve  problems;  model  solutions;  and  implement  strategies  that  are  efficient,  cost-\neffective, and flexible. \n  \n2.  Key Issues in ICT Development in Basic Education  \n13.  While integrating ICT in learning and teaching promises substantial potential benefits, to \nrealize these gains Uzbekistan must overcome considerable constraints over the medium and \nlong term. These constraints are summarized here and discussed in detail in Appendix 3.  \n \n14.  Teachers and ICT Use. Experience shows that teachers are a key to the success of ICT \nuse in schools. To date, a large majority of general secondary teachers in Uzbekistan have \nnever used a computer for any purpose. This is partly because of the policy of computer use \nonly for the subject of informatics, and partly due to the lack of computers in schools. To turn \nteachers  into  champions  of  ICT  use  and  a  prime  source  of  support  for  students,  they \nthemselves must first be familiar and comfortable with the technology, and become ICT adept in \ntheir own subject areas. This would require quality training of most of the 450,000 teachers \nwithin a relatively short time. The current in-service teacher training (INSETT) system would \nneed significant improvement to fulfill this task (A brief review of the current teacher training \nsystem and issues is in Appendix 4). In particular, current in-service training is inflexible and \nineffective, and is conducted at regional in-service teacher training institutes (RITTIs) located in \noblast centers. Training is residential and infrequent with only 24 days of training for each \nteacher every 5 years. The system is particularly inconvenient for women, who account for over \n70% of the teaching force in basic education and are often unable to attend long residential \n ", "4 \ncourses.3 To provide effective support for ICT use, the existing INSETT system will need to be \ntransformed to one that is closer to teachers, offers more frequent training (on a weekly or \nmonthly basis), and acts as a center for interacting networks among teachers and schools. On \nthe incentive side, the Government introduced a performance-based remuneration system in \n2003, and teachers\u2019 salaries have increased substantially. Qualification for ICT use in subject \nareas and general management will need to be incorporated in the incentive system.  \n \n15.  Learning Materials and ICT Use. Appropriate and adequate learning materials are a \nkey condition for successful application of ICT in schools. At present, such materials are not \navailable, and capacity is not adequate for developing such materials. The Government has \nmade it a priority to develop e-textbooks. However, considerable efforts are needed to build this \ncapacity,  which  is  basically  nonexistent.  In  developing  these  learning  materials,  wide \nparticipation must be encouraged, since this will require new concepts, skills, and talents that \nare not traditionally found in education circles. ICT will have a significant impact on the provision \nof  learning  and  teaching  materials  in  other  local  languages  of  instruction  (LOI)  because \ndeveloping alternative language versions of materials in electronic form is much easier and \ncheaper than in print form. ICT will make the provision of local language materials more cost \neffective, make materials more accessible to students with other LOIs, and have a positive \nimpact on the quality of their learning.  \n \n16.  Curriculum and Assessment System and ICT Use. Introducing ICT in schools will \nhelp to accelerate long overdue reforms in the national curriculum, state education standards, \nand  national  student  assessment  system.  Despite  past efforts,  the  curriculum  content  has \nremained  overloaded.  This  leaves  little  time  for  interactive  and  student-oriented  teaching \napproaches  and  practices.  While  curriculum  reform  is  a  principal  component  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) supported Second Textbook Development Project (STDP)4 currently \nbeing implemented, ICT provision to schools will give impetus to the reform process, especially \nfrom the students, parents, and teachers, to create more space in the curriculum and syllabus \nfor the effective use of ICT. This will complement the top-down approach used in curriculum \nreforms. The current student assessment system is time consuming (often using up to 50% of \nclass time) and disliked widely by teachers and students. Widespread ICT provision will require \nimprovements to develop an assessment system that is more practical and appropriate for a \nnew curriculum, based on methodologies, criteria, and indicators for measuring and promoting \nmodern learning and its outcomes. \n \n17.  School  E-Readiness  and  ICT  Service  and  Maintenance.  E-readiness  is  about \nmeeting basic conditions that make effective use of ICT in schools possible. Aside from ICT-\nqualified teachers, protocols and regulations must be developed and put in place for maintaining \nand properly using ICT facilities. Introducing ICT also requires proper physical conditions in \nschools. These include computer classrooms with proper wiring, security enhanced windows \nand doors, air-conditioning, and dust-reducing measures. School management must be strong \nsupporters and key change agents for ICT use, for which training will be needed as a priority. At \nthe same time, ICT will help to (i) enhance efficiency in using existing resources and reducing \ncosts  (electronic  timetabling  and  electronic  textbook  ordering),  and  (ii)  improve  school \nmanagement  capacity  (devolved  school  financing  and  computerized  information  systems). \nAdequate and timely service and maintenance at the school level is essential for ensuring \n                                                 \n3  The fact that a large number of primary teachers are unqualified (about 50% by Ministry of Public Education \nestimates in 2002) and that the utilization rate of RITTIs is low at 60% is a strong indication of the ineffectiveness of \nthe current INSETT system.  \n4  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Second Textbook Development Project. Manila. ", "5 \neffective use of ICT facilities. Establishing an effective nationwide network for such services will \nneed active and wide private sector participation. At present, these services exist mostly in \noblast centers and urban areas, but are lacking in rural and remote areas. Effective demand for \nservice and maintenance from schools is a key condition for establishing a nationwide service \nnetwork.  \n \n18.  Infrastructure Support and Power Supply. Access to the internet is an important part \nof  ICT  development.  Broadband  internet  connectivity  to  cluster  leader  schools  (CLSs)  will \nprovide  the  best  support  for  schools.  The  process  of  upgrading  the  country\u2019s \ntelecommunications network to achieve widespread broadband access is to be completed in the \nnext 2\u20133 years. In the interim, high-capacity connectivity will need to be provided to CLSs in \nphases where technically feasible. Prices for internet connections for schools will need to be \nadjusted to encourage internet use. Lack of reliable and predictable power supply during the \nschool day is a major obstacle to computer use in many rural and remote areas. Unpaid \nelectricity bills are a main reason for power cuts. Frequent and large-scale power surges are \ntypical of all regions and load-shedding in many areas can range from 2\u20133 hours to the whole \nschool day. Thus, ICT development in schools must consider appropriate policy and other \nmeasures to improve power supply especially to rural schools.   \n \n19.  Financial Sustainability of ICT. ICT in basic education is costly. At current unit costs, \nwith network-ready desktop personal computers5 and a target computer-student ratio of 1:42, \nequipping every basic education school will cost around $116 million. The annual replacement \ncosts of this investment are around $23 million at current costs based on a 5-year replacement \ncycle. Operational costs (consumables, maintenance, and servicing) would add an estimated \n$10 million a year. Even without internet connectivity, the recurrent costs could amount to \naround $35 million per year, which is equivalent to 6.2% of the basic education budget. In \naddition  to  these  direct  recurrent  costs,  indirect  recurrent  costs  include  training  teachers, \ndeveloping learning materials, providing technical and managerial support, and undertaking \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) of progress. The total cost of ownership of integrating ICT in \nschools, even at the current planned moderate level, will be substantial. In addition, under \ncurrent financing arrangements, schools have insufficient operation and maintenance (O&M) \nbudgets. The requirement from ICT use would add substantially to this gap, which, unless fully \nprovided by the Government, would seriously impair ICT development in schools.  \n \n20.  Pro-Poor  ICT  Development.  The  Government  has  a  clear  pro-poor  policy  in  ICT \ndevelopment in schools, with the objective of reducing and bridging the internal digital divide. \nAlready  funding  to  schools  varies  significantly  by  oblast.  Many  schools  rely  on  parental \ncontributions to make up for shortfalls in O&M budgets. This represents a disproportionate \nburden on the poor. In general, schools in relatively affluent urban areas tend to have better \nteachers and conditions, and are better positioned to generate income to support ICT. These \nfactors combined pose a serious challenge for the Government to provide the same access to \nschools in poor, rural, and remote areas as in urban areas and affluent centers.  \n    \n                                                 \n5  A typical network-ready desktop personal computer also known as a \u201cfat (thick) client\u201d device does the majority of \nthe application processing as well as storing applications software and data on its own hard disk. A fat client device \ncan be used away from the network as a stand-alone device. In contrast, a non-network ready desktop terminal \nalso known as the \u201cthin client\u201d network is one where the user, i.e., a student, can only access data and applications \nthat are stored in the central server. A thin client device may process only keyboard input and screen output, \nleaving all application processing to the server. A thin client terminal generally does not have a hard drive and may \nwell be unusable if disconnected from the network.   \n ", "6 \n3.  Government Strategy and Policy  \n  \n21.  Integrating ICT in schools is a key strategy of the Government to achieve its subsector \nobjective of improving the quality and relevance of basic education, and to ensure equal access \nto all. Full integration of ICT in basic education will require an ICT-based curriculum, abundant \nlearning materials, a majority of teachers adept at ICT use, adequate school conditions and \nphysical infrastructure in place, provision of financial resources to cover the total cost of ICT \nownership, and specifically designed pro-poor interventions from the public sector. At present, \nUzbekistan has  embarked  on  the initial  phase  to  providing  full ICT  integration  in  schools. \nCognizant of the tasks and the need to overcome considerable constraints, the Government has \ndeveloped a draft strategy with ADB assistance to guide medium- and long-term implementation \nof its ICT in basic education program (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n22.  The draft strategy focuses on long-term ICT development in basic education that will be \nfinancially  sustainable,  educationally  effective,  and  pro-poor.  To  achieve  this,  the  strategy \nproposes a phased approach, with the first phase in 2006\u20132010 and the second in 2011\u20132015. \nThis approach prioritizes the limited resources available during the first phase to build a firm \nfoundation for the long-term integration of ICT in basic education. Key to the first phase is to \ndemonstrate real education benefits from ICT use in all schools. This, along with improvements \nin the broad financial and fiscal environments, will lay the foundation for larger scale and more \nintegrated use of ICT in the second phase.  \n \n23.  Central  to  successful  implementation  during  the  first  phase  is  the  establishment  of \nschool clusters. Each cluster will contain an average of 11 schools so that 860 clusters will \ncover all schools in Uzbekistan. Each cluster will have a CLS whose role will be to lead all other \nschools in the cluster in activities relating to integrating ICT in teaching and learning. The school \ncluster concept is strategic\u2014instead of spreading the limited financial and human resources \nevenly but thinly across all schools, the country will focus its resources on (i) establishing CLSs \nas champions and mentors for the use of ICT in the educational process, and strongholds for \nfuture ICT expansion; (ii) fostering the school cluster network into an effective decentralized \ndelivery mechanism for, but not be limited to, teacher upgrading and ICT use in schools; and (iii) \nensuring effective use of ICT in poor and remote schools including internet access.  \n \n24.  In addition, ICT use in learning and teaching will be restricted to priority subject areas \nover a limited number of grades during the first phase. This will give more access time to ICT \nfacilities per student and teacher, thus allowing real education benefits to accrue with limited \nfinancial resources. Further cost reduction solutions will be examined, in particular, the \u201cthin \nclient\u201d option, which is promising to offer substantial savings in total cost of ownership. These \nmeasures combined will significantly strengthen the financial sustainability of the ICT policy.  \n  \n4.  Asian Development Bank Support for the Education Sector  \n \n25.  Basic education is a key area of focus of ADB assistance to Uzbekistan, and ADB is the \nlead  external  development  partner  in  basic  education.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  in  education \nfocuses on (i) supporting efforts to improve quality, relevance, and access to education; and (ii) \nenhancing  national  capacity  to  manage  sector  reforms.  Accordingly,  policy  dialogue  and \nassistance in basic education focus on addressing key issues and challenges of the subsector, \nwith five loans approved by ADB since 1997.  \n \n26.  ADB  assistance  to  the  sector  is  comprehensive,  including  (i)  establishing  a \ncomprehensive policy framework for the sector, which is the focus of the Education Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (ESDP);  (ii)  improving  governance,  education  financing,  and  sector ", "7 \nreform management, which is woven into all projects; (iii) continuing curriculum and assessment \nimprovement, which is a focus of the STDP; (iv) strengthening capacity of teachers and the \nteacher training system, which is a priority of both the ESDP and the Project; (v) meeting critical \ninvestment needs in learning materials especially textbooks, school libraries, and ICT facilities, \nwhich is a key activity in all projects; and (vi) supporting the poor and disadvantaged, which is a \nfocus of all projects. Technical assistance from ADB has supported this effort, in particular in \ninstitution and capacity development. Appendix 5 summarizes the complementarity between the \nProject and ongoing ADB projects in basic education. \n \n27.  In close coordination with ongoing ADB projects in the education sector, the Project will \nserve as catalyst for changes in a number of key issues in basic education. In preparing the \nProject,  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  key  stakeholders  including  the  Ministry  of  Public \nEducation  (MOPE)  and  Ministry  of  Finance  on  a  strategy  to  guide  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s ICT program in basic education over the next 10 years (para. 21). The strategy \npreparation is based on a comprehensive analysis of key constraints and opportunities including \nfinancial sustainability, educational preparedness, infrastructural support, and equitable access.  \n \n5.  Other External Support for the Education Sector \n \n28.  In  basic  education,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  the  United  Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  are  monitoring  learning \nachievements with results due by the end of 2005. This will be a useful step in addressing the \ncurrent lack of data on learning outcomes. The United Nations Development Programme has \nassisted Uzbekistan in preparing a national strategy for ICT development, which identifies \neducation  as  a  priority  sector  for  strategy  implementation.  The  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development has two ongoing projects: one is a pilot for strengthening learning \nand teaching, management, and participation in 100 schools; and the other is focusing on \npiloting ICT use in 60 schools. The latter has provided valuable experience in and lessons for \neffective and sustainable ICT use in schools. The World Bank is preparing its first education \nproject,  which  will  support  learning  materials  development,  teacher  training,  community \nparticipation, and school management. Some bilateral partners provide support in vocational \nand higher education. The People\u2019s Republic of China recently concluded an agreement to \nprovide a loan of $19 million to Uzbekistan in support of ICT in basic education. The Project was \nprepared in close coordination with all other external agencies active in the education sector. \nADB has initiated regular aid coordination meetings for the education sector, which will provide \na forum to discuss harmonization measures in the sector. A development coordination matrix is \nin Appendix 6.  \n \n6.  Lessons Learned  \n \n29.  Appendix 7 summarizes lessons learned and how they are incorporated in the project \ndesign. A key lesson learned in projects involving ICT development in schools, both from ADB \nand elsewhere, is the importance of development of the broad supporting environment. This \nincludes capacity building for teachers and staff, e-readiness of schools, e-learning materials \ndevelopment, and appropriate curriculum adjustments. Without, or with insufficient, essential \nsupport, the full potential benefits from ICT in schools will not be realized. These lessons are \nsupported by a recent UNESCO report on ICT experiences in Asia and the Pacific, which \nstresses the importance of a balanced approach combining hardware provision with appropriate \n ", "8 \nsupport  services.6  These  lessons  are  reflected  in  the  project  design.  Capacity  building  of \nteachers and staff and the institutional development of the in-service teaching training system \nmake up a key component of the Project to impart long-lasting benefits beyond the use of ICT. \nE-readiness is a condition for installation of ICT facilities in schools; the Project will provide \ngrants to encourage and stimulate development of e-learning materials especially in the Uzbek \nlanguage. For curriculum support, the Project will coordinate closely with the ongoing STDP, \nwhich has curriculum reform as a major component.  \n \n30.  The  importance  of  financial  sustainability  is  another  major  lesson  learned  in  most \nprojects for ICT development in education, and has major implications for equitability of access. \nEarly projects tended to underestimate the costs of O&M for ICT. Recent projects in other \ncountries have relied on parental contributions or other income-generating activities at schools \nto cover these costs. While enthusiasm about ICT use is widespread among students, parents, \nand teachers, parental contributions for ICT use would add a great burden especially for those \nwho are less able to afford it. Similarly, using school ICT facilities to generate income tends to \nwork in affluent and urban areas, while schools in poor and remote areas would end up being \ndisadvantaged. Instead, built on comprehensive financial and economic analysis, the Project \nseeks full funding of the total cost from the Government to ensure sustainability and equitable \naccess and use of ICT by the poor.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The impact of the Project is improved quality, relevance, and equitable access of basic \neducation for all students, including students in poor and remote areas. The outcome of the \nProject is the improvement of learning outcomes through ICT use in priority subject areas in \ngrades  5\u20139  in  project  schools  with  a  pro-poor  focus.  These  priority  subject  areas  are \nmathematics,  sciences,  history,  and  languages,  in  addition  to  informatics.  A  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n32.  The Project comprises four components: (i) establishment of school clusters for ICT, (ii) \nteacher and staff development for ICT, (iii) learning materials development, and (iv) capacity \nbuilding and management support. \n \n1.  Establishment of School Clusters for ICT \n33.  This component will develop an operational national network of 860 school clusters, \ncovering all 9,757 schools in Uzbekistan; each cluster will be led by a CLS.7 The Project will \nprovide  appropriate  ICT  facilities/connectivity  to  CLSs.  The  Government  will  provide  ICT \nfacilities to other schools in the clusters as part of its ICT in basic education program.  \n \n34.  As the strategic focus for investment in ICT hardware, connectivity, and training in ICT \nteaching and learning, professional development, and management skills, the CLSs will (i) \n                                                 \n6  United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. 2004. Infoshare and Sources and Resources \nBulletin 6: 2. \n7  The identification of school clusters and selection of CLSs has been completed, with easy accessibility to the CLS \nbeing the primary principle in forming clusters and selecting CLSs. About 70% of the CLSs selected are in rural or \npoor areas and 500 of the CLSs selected will have new school libraries to be funded under the STDP. ", "9 \nprovide an efficient delivery system to all schools for e-learning materials and information; (ii) \noperate as centers for all education development activities within the clusters; (iii) provide \npedagogical, technical, and management support to all schools in the cluster; (iv) provide the \ninstitutional structure for the rapid development of a decentralized and effective INSETT; (v) \ncoordinate with learning resource centers (LRCs) and the new school libraries, both being \ndeveloped  under  other  ADB-supported  projects;  (vi)  undertake  pilot  testing  and  research \ninitiatives related to ICT integration in basic education; and (vii) provide the vehicle for effective \nM&E of school ICT developments. Supplementary Appendix B outlines the role, responsibilities, \nand selection criteria of the CLSs. \n \n35.  The CLSs will be equipped with standard \u201cfat client\u201d networks under the Project because \nthey will need greater technical capacity and flexibility to fulfill their lead role in the clusters. \nThese include pedagogically essential peripherals including data projectors, digital cameras, \nprinters, and audiovisual equipment. Proposed specifications for hardware and peripherals are \nin Supplementary Appendix C. Each CLS will be supplied with one additional free-standing \ncomputer for school management/administration with a set of basic software, including (i) the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund school-based education management information system, (ii) \ntextbook ordering software (from the STDP), (iii) school timetabling software, and (iv) basic \nschool accounting software. The CLSs will have internet and intranet connectivity to ensure that \nthey receive a wide range of e-learning materials. All the e-learning materials will be distributed \nby the CLSs to all the schools in the cluster. Supplementary Appendix D provides an outline of \nthe phased manner in which connectivity will be extended to all CLSs. \n \n36.  Power  cuts  inhibit  the  full  use  of  ICT  hardware,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The \nGovernment will take appropriate and timely measures to ensure reliable power supply to all \nCLSs, and to all schools based on the experience with the CLSs. Reliable power supply will be \na condition for ICT installation. Adequate financing for O&M costs is identified as the key to \nensuring supply of consumables, and adequate servicing and maintenance, and thus to project \nsuccess. The Government will provide adequate and timely O&M allocations for all schools with \nICT  facilities,  including  CLSs,  to  ensure  effective  usage  and  sustainability.  The  Project  is \nexpected to create effective demand for ICT maintenance services through the availability of \nschool-based budgets, and will improve service quality through standard servicing contracts \nbetween schools and service providers.8  \n \n2.  Teacher and Staff Development for ICT  \n \n37.  This component will build the capacity of teachers and staff for improving teaching and \nlearning through ICT use. This will require (i) creation of trained trainers and development of \nspecially  designed  course  modules  in  the  RITTIs  in  high  priority  subject  areas  for  ICT \ndevelopment in basic education and across the curriculum; (ii) immediate training in essential \nskills provided first to CLSs and then to every school with ICT facilities; and (iii) strengthening of \nthe delivery of a decentralized system for continuous professional development (CPD) for all \nschool staff.  \n \n38.  Integrating  ICT  in  basic  education  will  create  new  demands  on  staff  and  on  the \ncontinuous upgrading of their professional skills. The training will cover (i) ICT skills in school \n                                                 \n8  At present the joint-stock company Uzuchavtomatica has a nationwide network for servicing computers in schools. \nAn effective way is to include servicing in equipment suppliers\u2019 contract, which is under consideration by MOPE. \nThe CLSs will play the support role for minor servicing and maintenance.   \n ", "10 \nnetwork management,9 (ii) subject-based courses for RITTI lecturers and teachers as future \ntrainers on the use of ICT across the curriculum, (iii) use of ICT in school administration, and (iv) \nintroduction of performance management and CPD for teachers. The Project will use the cluster \napproach to bring in-service training to local areas through the introduction of CPD, firstly in \nICT-related  training  but  thereafter  in  the  full  range  of  professional  training  and  upgrading \nrequirements. Bringing the existing in-service training system closer to schools and making it \nmore accessible to teachers and thus more effective will be a key to the success of capacity \nbuilding in support of ICT use. This will be accomplished through the CLSs, which will provide \nthe enabling institutional structure for the system. The Project will train 220 staff from the RITTIs \nand 560 staff from the LRCs in ICT-related skills, and will provide priority training to the CLSs \nand LRCs comprising 1,720 school network managers/ICT coordinators, 4,300 subject teachers \nin  the  use  of  ICT  in  priority  subjects,  and  1,720  administrators  and  specialists  in  school \nadministration  management  and  CPD  for  teachers.  During  2006\u20132010,  81,000  teachers, \ntechnicians, administrators, and school network managers from the 8,900 non-CLS schools will \nbe trained in the specialist skills required to integrate ICT into the basic education system.  \n \n39.  The Project will be closely coordinated with the ESDP. A focus of the ESDP is to \nstrengthen the RITTIs\u2019 capacity in distance education delivery. Where possible, the INSETT \ncourse modules developed to support ICT in basic education under the Project will be adapted \nfor distance education delivery. Enhancing CPD for teachers using the CLSs will require a \nsystem of performance management, which will be developed and made operational during the \nfirst year after loan effectiveness. The system will (i) identify annual staff needs for CPD, and (ii) \nlink training completed to performance targets and the remuneration system.  \n \n3.  Learning Materials Development for ICT \n \n40.  This component will develop appropriate learning materials in Uzbek and other local \nLOIs for priority subjects and grades, and will focus on developing local capacity for such \npurposes. This will require (i) training in learning materials development, (ii) development of e-\nmaterials in Uzbek and other LOIs, (iii) competitive award of grants to encourage competition \nand quality material development, and (iv) localization and translation of already successful \nsoftware from other countries.  \n \n41.  ICT use across the curriculum requires the development of e-materials, including (i) \ngeneric software applications such as spreadsheets and databases, (ii) web/intranet-based \nmaterials,  (iii)  e-books,  and  (iv)  subject-specific  educational  software.  These  materials  will \nsupport  teachers  in  the  use  of  ICT  and  help  students  to  work  independently.  Other  non-\ncomputer  based  ICT  materials  including  DVDs  (digital  video  disks)  and  other  audiovisual \nequipment  are  also  helpful  in  learning  and  teaching.  For  most  schools  without  direct \ninternet/intranet connections during the first phase of ICT development these materials can be \nprovided on CDs (compact disks), or downloaded and cached onto school servers. A portal will \nbe developed at MOPE for the intranet network within 9 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n42.  Training  in  e-materials  development  skills  will  be  provided  through  the  RITTIs. \nSpecifically,  200  staff  will  be  trained  in  licensing,  localizing,  and  translation  techniques  of \nexisting software in other languages and in developing original materials. The RITTIs will offer \ncourses in software development to 400 teachers and to private sector specialists on a cost-\nrecovery basis. The Project will award software development grants competitively, in close \n                                                 \n9  School visits indicate that the lack of effective school network management has caused significant problems in \nmany schools currently equipped with ICT facilities.  ", "11 \ncoordination with the STDP school library material development grant. The grants will initially \nconcentrate  on  the  adaptation  and  translation  into  local  languages  of  existing  educational \nsoftware with a proven track record of effectiveness.  \n \n4.  Capacity Building and Management Support  \n \n43.  This component will ensure project sustainability and effective implementation through \nthe development of appropriate policy and support for the introduction of ICT to basic education \nand effective project implementation.  \n \n44.  First, support will be provided for effective financial planning through the development of \nannual financial plans and budgets, including adequate annual operational budgets to support \neffective ICT use in schools and the determination of realistic ICT replacement and O&M \nbudgets for wider financial planning purposes. Second, support will be provided for targeted \nresearch/pilot  testing  activities,  including  (i)  income  generation  opportunities  (e.g.,  rural \ntelecenters for use by communities), (ii) decentralized school financing, (iii) use of ICT for \nstudents  with  special  education  needs,  (iv)  cost  comparisons  of  \u201cthin\u201d  and  \u201cfat  client\u201d \ntechnologies, and (v) alternative approaches to school connectivity particularly for schools in \nrural and remote areas with difficult access. Well-designed pilot testing and research will provide \nimportant  insights  for  future  policy  and  the  development  of  new  approaches  to  existing \nproblems. Third, the component will design and implement a system of M&E, which will provide \nvaluable feedback on project progress against objectives and provide the basis for the design of \nsuccessor projects and the formation of second phase ICT policy. Fourth, support will be given \nfor a national publicity campaign to ensure that all stakeholders and the wider communities are \nfully informed about the Government\u2019s plans for ICT development in basic education in general \nand the Project in particular. Staff development and pilot projects are outlined in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n  \nC.  Special Features \n \n45.  Pro-Poor Design. The Project\u2019s poverty focus is reflected in several major aspects of its \ndesign. First, about 70% of project schools will be in poor or rural areas where the majority of \nthe poor of the country reside. Second, through the school clusters, the Project will help ensure \naccess to internet connection, and provide technical and pedagogical support for effective ICT \nuse  to  all  schools  in  the  country  including  those  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  Third,  the \nGovernment is committed to providing adequate and timely financing for O&M, replacement, \nand other related costs for supporting ICT use in all schools as well as the initial investment and \nfuture replacement costs. These commitments are reflected in the project assurances and will \nbenefit the poor disproportionately since affordability issues are a greater concern for the poor. \nFourth, the Project will help to improve power supply to schools. Schools in poor and remote \nareas will benefit the most, not only from ICT use, but also for general lighting and heating \npurposes, as these schools currently experience less reliable power supply. Finally, the Project \nwill pilot test (i) ICT to improve learning and teaching for children with special education needs, \nwhich is a priority of the Government; and (ii) technologies that will improve connectivity for \nschools in remote areas.  \n \n46.  Integrated  and  Participatory  Approach  to  Project  Design  and  Implementation. \nGiven the complexity of the issues involved, the successful integration of ICT in basic education \nwill  require  a  comprehensive  approach.  The  Project  is  based  on  a  national  strategy  that \naddresses  key  issues  and  constraints  systematically,  including  financial  sustainability, \neducational preparedness, infrastructure support, and equitable access to ICT. The strategy \n ", "12 \nproposes a phased approach to ensure medium- and long-term success in ICT use in schools. \nThe Project emphasizes institution and capacity development through the establishment of \nschool clusters and the improvement of CPD for teachers. The school clusters will provide an \neffective mechanism for further decentralization and empowerment in basic education beyond \nthe use of ICT, and the improvement of INSETT will bring beneficial changes to the system in \naddition to ICT use. The project design has benefited significantly from a participatory approach. \nApart from MOPE and other agencies of the central Government, consultations were held at all \n14 oblast (province) centers, visits were made to over 30 of the 199 raions (districts), and over \n60  schools  and  makhallas  (communities),  where  over  180  focus  group  discussions  with \nteachers, parents, and students were conducted. In addition, six consultation workshops were \nheld at the central government level besides regular consultations with individual departments of \nkey  ministries.  Participation  will  also  be  a  key  characteristic  of  project  implementation.  In \nparticular, the school clusters will enable and encourage more interactions among teachers, \nparents, students, and local communities. Key issues related to integrating ICT in schools, and \nthe special features of the Project are described in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n47.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $43.0 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and other charges. Of the total cost, the \nforeign exchange cost is $26.1 million (61%), and the local currency cost is $16.9 million \nequivalent (39%). The indicative project cost estimates by component are summarized in Table \n1 and summary cost estimates by expense category are in Appendix 8.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost  \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Foreign  Local   \nComponent  Exchange Currency  Total \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n48.  The Government has requested a loan of $30.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB will finance 70% of the total cost of the Project, including 96% \nof the foreign exchange cost of $25.1 million and 29% of the local cost. The Government will \nfinance $1.0 million of foreign exchange cost and $12.0 million equivalent of local costs (Table \n2).

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n49.  MOPE will be the Executing Agency. Project management will consist of (i) a project \nsteering committee (PSC), (ii) a project director, and (iii) a project implementation unit (PIU). \nThe  PSC,  to  be  appointed  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  will  be  the  decision-making  body \nresponsible for overall project implementation and coordination. The project director, to be \nappointed by the PSC, will provide general guidance to the PIU in accordance with decisions \nmade by the PSC, arrange the quarterly PSC meetings, present quarterly reports to the PSC, \nand ensure coordination of project implementation within MOPE. Given MOPE\u2019s experience \nwith ADB project implementation accumulated since 1998 and the recent successful completion \nof the Basic Education Textbook Development Project,10  financial management arrangements \nof MOPE are satisfactory for purposes of implementation of the Project.  \n \n50.  As a part of its efforts to strengthen project implementation for more effective use of \npublic resources, MOPE is in the process of rationalizing project management in the education \nsector. Accordingly, the Project will integrate its management with that of ongoing projects in \nbasic  education  to  reduce  transaction  costs  and  maximize  economic  efficiency  in  project \nimplementation. In particular, the PSC for the Project will be integrated into one common PSC \nfor the ESDP and STDP. Members of the existing PSCs are from the Cabinet of Ministers, \nMOPE, Ministry of Finance, and other agencies; participation may be adjusted to meet the \nneeds of the Project. The PSC will also consider appointing the project director for the ESDP \nand STDP as the project director for the Project. \n \n51.  The PIU will be responsible for day-to-day project management, including procurement \nand recruitment, staff development, finance and accounting, and monitoring and evaluation; as \nwell as preparing detailed project implementation plans, annual reports, and quarterly progress \nreports to submit to the PSC, the project director, and ADB. The PIU will have 6\u20138 full-time staff \nwith expertise in these areas. To ensure timely start-up of project implementation, MOPE will \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Basic Education Textbook Development Project.  Manila. \n ", "14 \nappoint  a  project  manager,  who  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  coordination  of  project \nactivities. The PIU will be established in accordance with a government decision related to the \nestablishment and financing of this PIU, which will be covered by retroactive financing (para. \n57). The PIU will be established in the same premises as the PIUs of the two ongoing projects, \nand will coordinate closely with them across PIU functions, including sharing of staff where \nfeasible.  Eventual  consideration  will  be  given  to  measures  to  further  harmonize  project \nmanagement. A project management chart is in Appendix 9. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n52.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 1 January 2006 to 31 December \n2010. A project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n53.  The Project will procure (i) standard packages of ICT hardware and peripherals, and \nrelated furniture and other equipment for 860 CLSs; (ii) non-computer based learning materials \nand  equipment  including  audiovisual  sets;  and  (iii)  furniture  and  computers  for  office  and \nadministrative use. ADB loan-financed goods and services will be procured following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Procurement of largest value will be for ICT hardware, which may \nbe distributed into several packages each larger than $1 million to allow proper sequencing of \ninstallation of ICT equipment in schools.11 Goods and services will be procured by international \ncompetitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $1  million  equivalent,  or  by \ninternational shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 to $1 million equivalent. Direct \npurchase may be applicable for goods and services valued at less than $100,000 equivalent. \nProcurement of furniture and the development of software and e-materials valued at less than \n$0.5 million per contract may follow local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \nThe Government will finance and undertake necessary civil works, in particular to rehabilitate \nand upgrade computer classrooms. Minimum criteria to be met by a school prior to installation \nof ICT equipment have been agreed.  \n \n54.  The Government has been advised that ADB policy requires the borrower (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), bidders, suppliers, and contractors under ADB-financed contracts, \nto observe the highest standards of ethics during the procurement and execution of such \ncontracts. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n55.  The Project will require 212 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 52.5 \nperson-months  of  international  and  159.5  person-months  of  domestic  consulting.  Areas  of \nexpertise required include education reform and decentralization, software development, ICT in \nbasic education, training, CPD, school networking, and pilot project design and evaluation. \nInternational consultants will be engaged through a firm in association with domestic consultants \nusing quality and cost-based selection with full technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. PIU staff will be recruited separately using arrangements \n                                                 \n11  The Project envisages installation of ICT facilities and connectivity in CLSs in phases. This will allow necessary \nrehabilitation work on computer classrooms, meeting of other e-readiness conditions, and proper training of \nteachers and staff for ICT use and management. Given this and the fast-changing market conditions for ICT \nequipment, sequencing of procurement of ICT equipment is appropriate.  ", "15 \nsatisfactory to ADB. Outline terms of reference for international and domestic consultants are in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n56.  The proposed loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. If Government funds are first used for eligible expenditures, ADB's reimbursement \nprocedure will be applied. The Government requested the establishment of an imprest account, \nwith a ceiling of $150,000, to expedite loan disbursement. Statement of expenditure procedure \nwill be used to liquidate/replenish the imprest account and to reimburse eligible expenditures \nthat do not exceed $20,000 per payment.  \n \n6.  Retroactive Financing and Advanced Procurement Action \n57.  The Government has requested ADB to provide retroactive financing to cover the PIU \noperational expenditures from 26 August 2005 (completion date of loan appraisal) up to the loan \neffectiveness date. The Government has also requested advance procurement action for ICT \nequipment for the 860 CLSs and for office equipment and a vehicle for the PIU. The advance \naction will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The total \namount under retroactive financing is estimated at not more than $100,000. The Government \nwas advised that ADB approval of advance action and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to financing the Project. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n58.  MOPE will maintain separate accounts for project components financed by ADB and the \nGovernment,  and  will  prepare  financial  statements  according  to  international  accounting \nstandards.  MOPE  will  have  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited \nannually by independent auditors with adequate qualification, knowledge, and experience in \ninternational accounting practices acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited project \naccounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s reports including a separate audit \nopinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. The Government was \nadvised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. \n \n59.  MOPE will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly reports in English and in a format \nacceptable to ADB on progress made and problems encountered during the period under \nreview, the steps taken or proposed to remedy problems encountered during the quarter, and \nthe proposed activities and expected progress during the following period. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, MOPE will submit a project completion report to ADB to \nfacilitate postevaluation of the Project. The project completion report will provide details about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n60.  In addition to targets specified in the project framework, systematic monitoring and \nevaluation will be specifically developed and undertaken during project implementation. For this \npurpose a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project performance in relation to its \nimpact, outcome, and outputs will be agreed upon prior to loan negotiations (Appendix 13). The \nestablishment of the baseline values of the indicators will be one of the first activities after \n ", "16 \nproject implementation begins and the PIU is established. Since the first CLSs are unlikely to \ncome onstream until the third quarter of 2006, this will allow sufficient time to design and \nconduct the baseline study and establish definitive indicators. Monitoring indicators will be \nmeasured and reported on annually during project implementation. Comments and findings on \nthese indicators will be incorporated into quarterly reports to ADB. In addition to indicators for \nimplementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be  measured  at  project \ncompletion  and  3  years  afterward.  Where  feasible  and  appropriate,  these  data  should  be \ndisaggregated  by  poverty  rating,  gender,  LOI,  and  location  (oblast/raion  and \nremote/rural/urban). At project inception, completion, and 3 years after completion, MOPE will \nsubmit to ADB a report that summarizes the key findings of monitoring and evaluation of \nchanges that occurred in the 3 preceding years. The PIU will be responsible for monitoring \nproject activities using data and feedback from the RITTIs, LRCs, oblast and raion education \ndepartments, oblast finance departments, CLSs including teachers, students and parents, and \ndomestic and international consultant reports.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n61.  The Project will be reviewed at least twice a year. In addition, given that much of the \nresearch  and  pilot  testing  will  be  carried  out  during  the  first  years  of  implementation, \ncomprehensive reviews of project performance will be conducted at the end of the first and third \nyears  of  implementation.  The  first  comprehensive  review  will  focus  on  the  results  and \nimplications of research and pilot testing, as well as the effectiveness of the implementation \narrangements.  The  second  (midterm)  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify any changes required since the time of \nproject appraisal; (iii) assess progress of project implementation against performance indicators; \n(iv) review progress made by the Government in ensuring financial sustainability of introducing \nICT  in  basic  education;  and  (v)  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n62.  The  Mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to  Government  officials  and \nhighlighted paras. 1.06 to 1.08 of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement on issues concerning fraud \nand corruption. The Government agreed to include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption \npolicy in all documents and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the Project. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n63.  Direct Beneficiaries. The Project will directly benefit students in grades 5\u20139 in the 860 \nCLSs, totaling 540,000 during the life of the Project. The benefits will come from the improved \nlearning  and  teaching  conditions  resulting  from  the  provision  and  application  of  ICT  in \nclassrooms and internet connections. Direct beneficiaries will also include 7,740 teachers in \nCLSs, 63,200 teachers in non-CLSs, 1,720 CLS school management staff, 17,800 management \nstaff in non-CLSs, 220 RITTI lecturers, and 600 local language e-materials developers, whose \nskills will improve by the targeted training to be provided under the Project. Given the proposed \ncentral role of the CLSs in the school system, all students and teachers will benefit from the \nProject, albeit to a less intensive degree than those identified here. This would amount to about \n6 million students and 200,000 teachers during 2006\u20132010. Finally, the Project will seek to ", "17 \nextend ICT facilities in schools to the wider community, from which an estimated 1 million \nhouseholds in mostly poorer rural areas will benefit.  \n \n64.  Poverty and Social Development Impact. The Project will have a direct beneficial \nimpact on about 165,000 poor students in grades 5\u20139 enrolled in the 860 CLSs during 2006\u2013\n2011.12 Specific pro-poor measures of the Project include (i) ensuring about 70% of the 860 \nCLSs from rural and poor areas; (ii) improving power supply to schools to ensure proper \nworking of the ICT facilities installed as well as for general lighting and heating purposes in \nwinter;13 and (iii) developing stakeholder awareness of the needs of vulnerable children and pilot \ndemonstration on the development of e-learning materials and teacher trainings. By providing \nICT facilities and internet connectivity, the Project will benefit the poor and help to bridge the \ninternal digital divide. The Project will address the issue of increasing parental contributions to \nschools, which burdens the poor disproportionately, by ensuring that no parental contributions \nwill be required for ICT use in schools. Finally, the Project will benefit an estimated 1 million \nhouseholds in poor and rural communities through open access to ICT facilities in schools.14  \n \n65.  The Project will provide an assessment of gender stereotyping through analysis of e-\nmaterials content and identify appropriate strategies for improving the presentation of gender \nroles and issues. The Project will ensure that girls and boys have equal access to all required \nlearning e-materials and ICT. The improved INSETT system that is closer to schools and more \nflexible will benefit at least 28,000 women teachers who account for over 70% of the teaching \nforce in the CLSs, with a far greater number of women teachers in the school system who will \nbenefit during the life of the Project. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 14.  \n \n66.  Educational Benefits. The main educational benefits from the introduction of ICT into \nbasic  education  will  be  a  fundamental  shift  to  student  centered  learning  and  teaching \nmethodologies. This will be reflected in (i) the link between integrated ICT use in the school \ncurriculum  and  improved  student  performance  in  the  priority  subjects  for  ICT  use;  (ii)  the \ndevelopment of skills and competencies (as opposed to factual knowledge accumulation) and \nthe development of higher order thinking skills; (iii) increased student responsibility for their own \nwork,  enhanced  student  research  capacity,  and  greater  individual  learning;  (iv)  enhanced \nstudents\u2019 motivation; and (v) increased relevance of education due to familiarity with information \nand computers. These combined will have a positive impact on the overall system to produce \ngraduates  with  the  ability  to  meet  working  life  challenges  in  the  21st  century  where  the \nworkforce  will  be  required  to  have  increasingly  advanced  skills  in  information  access, \nmanagement, processing, and usage. \n \n67.   The  Project  will  significantly  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  for  CPD  for \nteachers. In particular, the establishment of school clusters and the close working relationship \nrequired between the existing RITTIs and CLSs under the Project will make the content of CPD \nmore relevant and its delivery more effective. The Project will also lay the foundation for the \nplanned second phase of ICT development after 2010, which is expected to lead to rapid gains \nin learning outcomes. \n \n                                                 \n12  This assumes that 27.5% of the students on average are from poor families, a poverty indicator based on the \nWorld Bank Living Standard Assessment (2004).  \n13  Lack of heating is cited as one reason that some parents do not let their children go to schools in winter.  \n14 Experience in other countries shows that access to ICT facilities and the internet has a particularly beneficial \nimpact on rural communities.   \n ", "18 \n68.  Financial and Economic Analyses. The most significant economic benefit will come \nfrom (i) increases in future earnings of school graduates with better education attainment and \ninformation literacy, and (ii) better utilization of the 20% of teacher time currently allocated for \nprofessional  development.  Under  plausible  assumptions,  extra  earnings  of  about  600,000 \ngraduates could reach $30 million a year. The collaboration between cluster schools will utilize \nthe allocated CPD day more fully. This would be equivalent to $16.1 million a year assuming a \n50% effective recovery rate of the teachers\u2019 salaries for the CPD day that is lost under the \ncurrent system. Quantifiable benefits will also come from each of the four project components \nby  reducing  costs  or  increasing  efficiency  in  existing  expenditures.  The  total  quantifiable \neconomic benefit of the Project is estimated at $54.8 million per year. The net present value \n(NPV) of the project impact under the high case scenario of economic benefit utilization is $69.1 \nmillion with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 43% from 2006\u20132015. In the medium \ncase scenario, the NPV is $29.9 million with an EIRR of 23%, while the NPV in the low case \nscenario is minus $17.6 million with an EIRR of 6%. While the low case scenario indicates the \npotential  risk  of  the  Project,  the medium  and  high case  scenarios  highlight  the  significant \nbenefits of the Project with accelerated rate of economic benefit utilization. In both the high and \nlow case scenarios, the total Government commitment to externally funded projects in education \nis deemed affordable and sustainable. The economic and financial analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n69.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will carry out minor repairs and \nrehabilitation of existing school buildings and facilities to be funded by the Government, with no \nland acquisition required, or negative environmental or resettlement impact. The Project will \nenhance access and equity for education directly for about 45,000 students using other LOIs in \nthe CLSs through equal access to ICT facilities and the creation of learning materials under the \nProject. Development of e-learning materials will help reduce production costs of textbooks in \nother LOIs thus benefiting the students by increasing the availability of learning materials.  \n \nB.   Risks \n \n70.  The Project faces three major types of risks.  \n \n71.  Risks Related to the Adoption of New Technology. Using ICT in schools is new; \nmore than 50% of schools have never had access to computers. The risks of inadequate and \ninappropriate use of ICT as well as mismanagement of the facilities will be high. These risks will \nbe mitigated by extensive capacity building for teachers and school management to ensure \nintended use and impact of ICT in schools. \n \n72.  Infrastructure and Logistical Risks. For the effective use of ICT in schools, the Project \nwill  require  a  number  of  basic  infrastructure  and  logistical  conditions  to  be  met,  including \nappropriate  classroom  facilities  with  security  arrangements,  power  supply,  internet/intranet \nconnectivity,  and  services  and  maintenance.  These  concerns  are  addressed  through \ncovenanted assurances. \n \n73.  Financial Sustainability Risks. Throughout the design of the Project, the financial \nimplications of the integration of ICT have been carefully reviewed and extensive consultations \nheld with the Government to ensure the Project and the Government\u2019s plans for integrating ICT \nin basic education are financially sustainable. The Project addresses these concerns through (i) \ncovenants on adequate and timely budget provision for O&M and replacement costs; (ii) piloting \nof low cost \u201cthin-client\u201d solutions; and (iii) a strong focus on financial sustainability during project \nreviews, including the midterm review.  ", "19 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n75.  Government Counterpart Funding. The Government will allocate annually, in a timely \nmanner, adequate funding in the budget for the counterpart funding specified by the Project, \nand will provide ADB with information on such allocations annually. \n  \n76.  Financing  for  Sustainable  ICT  Use  in  All  Schools.  The  Government  will  make \nadequate annual budget allocations in the medium-term budgetary framework satisfactory to \nADB  for  ICT  use  in  all  schools  to  cover  hardware  investments,  O&M  costs  including \nconsumables, servicing, maintenance, electricity, cost of equipment replacement, and cost of in-\nservice teacher training, by (i) adopting a regulation describing operational and strategic goals \nfor all schools and budget allocations assigned to them; (ii)  establishing a quarterly reporting \nsystem showing the receipts and use of funds intended for ICT use by all schools; (iii) allocating \nin  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  an  amount  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  cover  the \nreplacement costs of the equipment; and (iv) providing information on an annual basis to ADB \non items (i), (ii), and (iii) before the state budget is finalized. \n \n77.  Connectivity  for  CLSs.  The  Government  will  provide  (i)  reliable  connectivity  to  all \nCLSs; (ii) technical specifications related to connectivity before each contract package of ICT \nequipment financed by ADB is finalized; and (iii) adequate financing in a timely manner to cover \nthe installation and operational costs of internet/intranet connectivity for all CLSs by adopting \nthe same mechanism as indicated in para. 76, items (i), (ii), and (iv).  \n \n78.  Pricing Adjustment to Encourage Internet Connection. The Government through \nMOPE will initiate discussions with Uzbektelecom with a view to successfully reducing prices for \ninternet connections for project schools within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n79.  Incentives for Professional Development for Teachers in ICT Use. The Government \nthrough MOPE will integrate teachers\u2019 professional development in ICT use into the improved \nincentive system for teachers. This incentive will recognize and reward teachers who have \nreceived  ICT  training  with  certification.  The  Government  through  MOPE  will  propose  such \nincentive schemes by 31 December 2006 for piloting starting in 2007, and will inform and \nupdate ADB on the progress of such piloting.  \n \n80.  ICT Installation in All Schools. The Government through MOPE will ensure that oblast \nand raion staff will rigorously apply the national guidelines for ICT installation prior to ICT \ninstallation to ensure that all schools are ready to receive ICT installations. Specifically, no \nschool should be supplied with an ICT installation unless a suitable ICT classroom is available, \nwith necessary security arrangements and reliable power supply, and at least one staff member \nhas training in the management of hardware and the school network. The Government through \nMOPE will semiannually update ADB on progress of the Government program of ICT provision \nto schools.  \n \n81.  Priority  for  Rehabilitation  of  CLSs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  school \nrehabilitation and refurbishment of computer rooms, including the safe rewiring of premises, \nprovision of adequate climate control (air-conditioning and dust-control measures), and security \narrangements to CLSs will be completed according to the minimum criteria agreed between the \n ", "20 \nGovernment and ADB, and Government regulations, including Cabinet of Ministers\u2019 resolution \n321 of 9 June 2004. The Government will ensure that the rehabilitation of schools will be carried \nout in a timely manner to ensure expeditious installation of ICT equipment in the CLSs.  \n \n82.  Rehabilitation of CLSs. The Government will ensure that rehabilitation of CLSs will \ninvolve only minor civil works with no negative environmental impact. The Government will \nensure that the rehabilitation will not entail any land acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n83.  Power Supply to All Schools. The Government through MOPE, Ministry of Finance, \nand the State Joint-Stock Company UZBEKENERGO will, within 6 months of loan effectiveness, \ntake appropriate measures satisfactory to ADB to ensure reliable power supply to all CLSs. This \nwill be treated as a pilot for reliable power supply to all schools. The midterm review of the \nProject will assess the piloting of CLSs. Based on the assessment, the Government will within 6 \nmonths after the midterm review take effective measures satisfactory to ADB for establishing a \nsystem of reliable power supply for ICT use in all schools.  \n \n84.  Extended School Opening Time. MOPE will ensure through the issuance of a MOPE \nregulation that current school regulations are appropriately adjusted by December 2006 to allow \nextended school opening and operating time for computer rooms for ICT use.  \n \n85.  Devolved Financing Experiments for CLSs. The Government will undertake to pilot \ndifferent  methods  of  devolved  funding  to  some  CLSs  to  test  decentralized  resource \nmanagement and will inform ADB on this piloting. \n \n86.  Effective Monitoring and Evaluation. The Government will ensure that a monitoring \nand  evaluation  system  will  be  established  after  loan  effectiveness,  and  be  made  fully \noperational  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  with  baseline  data  established  within  6 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. \n \n87.  Ethnic Minorities. The Government will ensure the development of learning materials in \nother LOI under the Project and will provide students in other LOI with equal access to ICT \nfacilities.  \n \nB.   Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n88.  The establishment of the PIU headed by a manager with experience and qualification \nacceptable to ADB is a condition for loan effectiveness. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n89.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  20,408,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Information  and \nCommunications Technology in Basic Education Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including the grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board.  \n \n Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n \n3 October 2005        ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \nImproved quality,  Learning outcomes of  MLA results (expected in  Assumptions \nrelevance, and equitable  students will improve  August 2005 by United  \u2022 No major disturbance to \naccess of basic  from the baseline value  Nations Children\u2019s Fund  forecasted economic \neducation for all  of xx (based on the  (UNICEF) and United  growth rates  \nstudents  results of the  Nations Educational,  \u2022 Continued progress in \n   monitoring learning  Scientific, and Cultural  reforms in basic \nachievements [MLA]  Organization (UNESCO)  education \nresults)a to xx by 2011.    \u2022 Continued improvement \n  Baseline study to be  in disclosure of relevant \nSchool graduates have  completed within 12  statistics and information \ndeveloped information  months of loan \nand communications  effectiveness  Risks \ntechnology (ICT) skills     \u2022 Change in budget \nthat have greater labor  National testing results  allocation priorities away \nmarket relevance and  (test to be improved  from ICT and basic \nenhances life-learning  under Second Textbook  education \nability, as measured by  Development Project \n\u2022 Inadequate allocation for \ntest results of  [STDP] and adopted by \nICT replacement costs  \nInternational Computer  2009)    \nDriver License   \nStandards from an  Labor market statistics  \nestimated 1% in 2005   \nto 75% by 2011.  \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved learning  Increased use of ICT by  School Development  \u2022  Adequate budget \noutcomes through ICT  teachers and students  Fund annual reports  allocations for recurrent \nuse in priority subject  in targeted subjects and    costs of ICT use in \nareas in grades 5\u20139 in  grades as measured by  Ministry of Finance  schools  \nproject schools with a  usage hours of ICT in  (MOF) and Ministry of   \npro-poor focus   classrooms (from 0 to  Public Education (MOPE)   Risks \n  2.5 hours/week) by  budget allocations and  \u2022  Installation of ICT in non-\n  2010  execution information  cluster leader schools \n      (CLSs) in the government \n  Annual qualitative/  Annual monitoring and  program before these \nquantitative  evaluation (M&E) reports  schools are e-ready  \n \nassessment of    \u2022  Government provision of \n \nimprovement in  Student self-evaluation,  ICT to non-CLSs too slow \nlearning  teachers\u2019, parents\u2019, and  for timely establishment \n  independent evaluations  of school clusters \nAnnual qualitative/ \n  \u2022  Lack of coordination with \nquantitative \n  and/or progress in other \nassessment of \n  Asian Development Bank \nimprovement in \n  (ADB) projects relevant to \nteaching practice  \n  this Project could affect \n \nAnnual assessment of    quality and progress of \nimprovements in    the Project  \nmotivation and interest     \n \nof teachers and  \n \na The outcome of the Monitoring of Learning Achievements will be available by the end of 2005.  \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \n  students in teaching  Project implementation   \nand learning)  reports \n   \nEquitable access to ICT  ADB midterm and other \nprovided to all schools  review missions and \n  reports \nAt least 70% of CLSs   \nare poor or rural  ADB field visits and \nschools by 2011  reports \n \nBaseline study and focus \ngroup discussions as \nfollow up \nOutputs      Assumptions \nComponent 1      \u2022  Adequate and timely \nSchool cluster network  Repairs and  MOPE, MOF, oblast and  provision of school \nestablished, equipped,  rehabilitation to school  raion, and school budgets  budgets by the \nand functional  ICT classrooms (if  and disbursements  Government for schools\u2019 \n  necessary) completed  School Development  ICT use  \n  by the Government  Fund reports  \u2022  Uninterrupted supply of \n  before ICT installation    ICT equipment for the \n  Project implementation  Project \n  reports   \n    Risk \nICT equipment and  ADB missions and field  \u2022  Delays in repairs and \ninternet/intranet  visits to schools  rehabilitation of computer \nconnectivity provided to    classrooms under the \n50% of CLSs within 12  Annual M&E reports  Government component \nmonths after loan   \neffectiveness;

The Government\u2019s stated long-term reform goal for education is to transform the system \ninto one that is consistent with a market-oriented economy and a democratic society in the 21st \ncentury. To realize this national aspiration, the basic education subsector faces key challenges \nto improve its quality, relevance, and equitable access for all. Major constraints are analyzed in \nthis appendix (a problem tree analysis is attached).  \n \n2.  Governance and Management. Education system governance is characterized by top-\ndown,  overly  centralized  decision  making.  Until  recently  the  Ministry  of  Public  Education \n(MOPE) had no policy mandate but operated as the implementing agency for policies and \nstrategies determined by the Cabinet of Ministers. This situation started to change in 2005 with \nprogress in decentralization and the ongoing civil service reform, which aims to provide sector \nministries with greater policy responsibility. However, MOPE remains weak in strategic planning, \npolicy making, and sector management capacity. Coordination between and within ministries \nand  government  agencies  especially  at  the  policy  level  is  systematically  lacking.  The \nwidespread  practice  of  compartmentalization  of  responsibilities  often  leads  to  policies  and \ndecision making based on insufficient information and with only a restricted understanding of the \nfull implications of critical decisions.  \n \n3.  Within this highly bureaucratic system, norms rule. For example, in all subjects taught, \nprograms and standards set by the central Government strictly dictate the contents and time \nallocated for the subjects, leaving inadequate freedom for schools to adjust to student needs \nand local conditions. State norms fix student-teacher ratios countrywide, and schools have \nneither the power nor budgetary incentives to strive for optimal use of existing resources. \nSchools have little discretionary spending authority over their budgets. As a result, the system \ndoes not encourage nor reward capacity building in planning and management skills.  \n \n4.  Within  MOPE  many  of  these  problems  and  their  consequences  seem  to  now  be \nrecognized  and  attempts  are  under  way  for  further  decentralization  of  decision  making  to \nschools and for an upgrading in school management capacity. Of particular concern is the lack \nof effective targeting of the Government\u2019s financial support for the poorest. At present 15% of all \ntextbooks (and 100% of grade 1 textbooks) are provided free of charge to schools; an annual \nfund allocation is provided to all schools for winter clothes and shoes. Unfortunately, this pro-\npoor support is based on a fixed and equal level of support for every school, irrespective of the \npoverty status of the school. Thus the fund allocation does not target the poorest.1 \n \n5.  Curriculum,  Assessment,  and  Structure  of  Education.  Although  attempts  at \ncurriculum change have been ongoing since 1991 and some progress has been made in \nreforming  state  education  standards,  the  current  curriculum  continues  to  be  overloaded  in \ncontent, with too many subjects and an emphasis on factual recall and on repetitive exercises \nrather  than  on  the  development  of  key  skills  and  competencies.  Difficulties  in  achieving \nsignificant curriculum reform since independence stem from (i) a continuing belief among many \nsenior educators that the traditional education model should not be significantly changed, and \n(ii) a lack of knowledge and appreciation of modern curriculum. This has led to approaches to \ncurriculum reform that are based on minor amendments of the existing curriculum. Because little \n                                                 \n1  As an example, two neighboring makhallas (community \u2013 the lowest government-recognized administration unit in \nUzbekistan) in one raion in Ferghana oblast provided poverty data indicating 2% of families living below the poverty \nline in one makhalla and 97% of families living below the poverty line in the other. Both makhallas received the \nsame per capita poverty allocations. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nis taken out and much is added, the problem of curriculum overload gets worse and the basic \nstructure of the curriculum remains unchanged.  \n \n6.  The overloaded curriculum reinforces didactic teacher-centered classroom approaches \nand inhibits any significant shift to student-centered learning because of the time constraints \nimposed by excessive content and the need to move fast in order to complete the syllabuses in \nthe time available. Thus the current curriculum fails to provide a suitable framework for the more \nrelevant learning outcomes required by the Government as part of its wider education strategy. \nA shift to the development of skills and higher order thinking cannot be delivered if no classroom \ntime is available to practice these learning objectives.  \n \n7.  The current assessment and testing system is based on student grading by individual \nteachers in the lower grades2 and national tests, which are also administered and marked by \nstudents\u2019  own  subject  teachers,  who  are  often  also  providing  them  with  paid  examination \ncoaching. Apart from potential conflict of interest, this system provides for no effective and \nreliable assessment. It is impossible currently to compare student attainment on a national, \noblast, raion, or school basis, or to compare progress in the national achievement of attainment \ntargets year-on-year or internationally. Current language of instruction (LOI) policy guarantees \nthe rights of ethnic minorities to education, but the policy is expensive, and concerns exist about \ninequity in the educational opportunities and quality provided to different language groups. \nEquity in the provision of educational materials is a particular problem because of the relatively \nhigh unit costs of printing textbook titles in low print runs for small language groups. \n \n8.  The transition from an 11- to a 12-year system of education is expensive and for a \nnumber of years between 1997 and 2004 it diverted urgently needed funding away from basic \neducation. The transition to a 12-year system where students will have to transfer from basic \nschools to specialized professional colleges and academic lyceums after grade 9 will mean that \nmany students will have to travel farther to school and will incur additional costs as a result. This \ncould have an adverse impact on the progression rate from grade 9 to grade 10, particularly in \nrural areas and for poorer families. The problem is aggravated by less reliable transportation \nsystems in rural areas, which exacerbate the problems of student travel to more distant schools.  \n \n9.  Education  Financing.  As  a  high  priority,  education  expenditure  in  real  terms  has \nincreased every year since 2000, and stood at 9.5% of gross domestic product in 2005.3 \nHowever, basic education was relatively underfunded versus other subsector.4 Aware of the \ndeterioration in physical plant and facilities in basic education due to years of underfunding, the \nGovernment launched the National Program for Basic Education Development 2004\u20132009 for \nthe urgent rehabilitation and upgrading of the whole system. Within the sector, basic education \nexpenditure has risen from 45.5% to 50.3% over the past 5 years and will continue to rise \naccording to Ministry of Finance.  \n \n10.  To help meet growing costs of education reform and maintenance of the basic education \ninfrastructure, education financing has been decentralized since 2000 to oblast and raion levels. \n                                                 \n2  The current rating system is universally unpopular with students, parents, and teachers. Teachers can often spend \nup to 50% of lesson time completing student grading sheets, which increases the pressure to complete an already \noverloaded curriculum.  \n3  The average for the member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development is 5.1% for \nthe same period.  \n4  In 2004 preschool enrolment was just 8.0% of total enrolment in basic and senior secondary education but \nreceived 14.1% of the total education budget4 and per capita expenditure on senior secondary has been more than \ndouble per capita expenditure on basic education for the past few years. ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nIn 2005, 65% of the national education budget is raion financed, 22% is oblast financed, and \nonly 13% comes from the state budget. Unfortunately, variations in incomes and tax collection \ncapacity have led to increasing differentials over funding for schools. This in turn is seen as a \nmain reason for perceived variations across oblasts in the quality of education.  \n \n11.  The current norm-based budgeting places high priority on teachers\u2019 remuneration and \nutility at the expense of other items. In 2005, these two items represent almost 87% of the total \neducation recurrent budget. Further salary increases agreed in June 2005 might well push the \nsalary/social cost component of the basic education recurrent budget over 90% in 2006. While \nincreasing teachers\u2019 salary is a good policy in itself, this increase without an increase in the \ngeneral recurrent budget allocation will bring further pressure to bear on already inadequate \nschool operating budgets. This may well result in increased demands for parental contributions. \nSuch contributions are widely in use and have a disproportionately adverse impact on the poor.  \n \n12.  The current financing system, which establishes norms for every aspect of the education \nsystem; removes management flexibility from oblasts, raions, and individual schools; and makes \ndeveloping  genuine  financial  management  skills  at  any  level  of  the  system  difficult.  The \nestablishment of minimum school cost profiles and the provision of devolved, school-based, per \ncapita financing budgets based on these profiles would provide the opportunity for all schools to \ntake  their  own  priority  financing  decisions,  based  on  their  own  (and  their  community) \nperceptions of priority needs within an adequate budgetary framework. This could rapidly lead to \nbetter use of available funds and a more cost-effective school financing system,5 and relieve the \nburden on the poor. \n \n13.  Resources  and  Inputs.  Basic  education  suffers  from  insufficient  investment  in \ninfrastructure, equipment, and facilities. A 2004 nationwide survey revealed that 40% of schools \nare housed in inappropriate and unfit buildings. There are also wide variations in the supportive \ninfrastructure, including power supplies to schools and telecommunications facilities. Resources \ntend to be a particular problem in rural areas, where 80% of schools are located and where \nfacilities tend to be worse. Remote schools with difficult access suffer from particular resource \nprovision problems and require special consideration. \n \n14.  Lack of sufficient and appropriate learning materials continues to be a problem. Despite \nthe success of the textbook rental scheme, high costs of textbooks in those subjects not \ncovered by the scheme prevent some parents from purchasing them. There is a clear need \neither to reduce the number of required textbooks or to include all prescribed textbooks within \nthe scheme to reduce parental expenditure on textbooks. School libraries have not been funded \nfor almost 20 years and school library stock is out-of-date and largely redundant. This has an \nadverse impact on the development of independent learning and the shift to student-centered \nlearning. Laboratory equipment and necessary consumables are in short supply. In 2004 only \n18% of basic schools had access to modern personal computers and just 50% of schools had \naccess to any form of computers, including those of the Soviet era. Very few basic schools have \ninternet access and many schools cannot afford the costs of consumables, maintenance, and \nservicing associated with information and communications technology (ICT) use. Almost no e-\nresources are available in Uzbek or other local LOI, which limits the impact of the introduction of \nICT. Learning materials in the local LOI are in particular short supply, which has an impact on \nequity between different LOIs. \n \n                                                 \n5  A United States Agency for International Development experiment in per capita school financing is currently under \nway in Akkurgan raion, Tashkent oblast. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \n15.  A reformed basic education system requires appropriately qualified teachers. At present, \nthe  large  majority  of  teachers  have  little  previous  experience  or  knowledge  of  alternative \nteaching and learning approaches, and little or no experience of ICT and its potential use across \nthe  curriculum.  MOPE  considers  about  50%  of  primary  school  teachers  to  be  unqualified \n(without higher education), and many are overspecialized in narrow subject areas. While the \nGovernment has improved teachers\u2019 pay significantly over the past 2 years, defined career \nopportunities are lacking. The current in-service teacher training system is distant from the \nschools (located in oblast centers) and infrequent (once every 5 years). Such an inflexible \nsystem is particularly inconvenient to women who account for over 70% of all teachers. The in-\nservice teacher training system needs to be urgently improved to retool teachers in a relatively \nshort period of time.  \n \n16.  Demand-Side  Issues.  Preliminary  results  of  focus  group  interviews6  with  parents, \nstudents, and teachers indicate general parental satisfaction with schools and teachers (who \nare considered to be doing their best in difficult circumstances) but a high level of dissatisfaction \nwith many specific aspects of the current education. Parents are primarily concerned with the \nhigh costs of education, the poor physical facilities in schools, and the risks to student health \nand welfare of unheated schools in winter with outdoor toilet and washing facilities. Students are \nuncertain of the relevance of the curriculum, apprehensive about future job opportunities, dislike \nthe work burden of an overloaded curriculum, and unsatisfied with teachers who are unskilled in \nICT and new technologies. Increasing costs of higher education imply less access; this is \nbecoming a growing concern of students in schools. Teachers are concerned by poor working \nconditions; lack of teaching and learning resources; heavy work burden of the student rating \nsystem; and lack of clear career opportunities, particularly for women. All of these issues have \nan impact on attitudes to education in the community. They do not yet seem to add up to \nwidespread  disenchantment  with  the  system,  although  many  complaints  and  much \ndissatisfaction have been voiced over specific problems.  \n \n17.  Student attendance problems may be viewed as an indicator of decreasing demand for \neducation, although precisely assessing the exact level of absenteeism overall and in specific \nregions is difficult.7 The main causes of absenteeism are believed to be the high costs of \neducation to poor parents. These costs include (i) parental contributions; (ii) opportunity costs of \nalternatives to education (income-generating work outside schools); and (iii) costs and time \ninvolved in student travel to school in some rural areas, and unwelcoming school conditions in \nwinter. Absenteeism is widely seen as a particular problem of poor families in rural areas. \n \n18.  The transition from an 11-year to a 12-year secondary education system may also \ninadvertently affect demand for education. Many students and parents would prefer to maintain \nthe existing 11-year system and to complete their secondary education in the same school, \nrather than transfer to another school after grade 9. Although progression rates from grade 9 to \ngrade 10 are high, schools report that the additional traveling time and costs incurred in shifting \nto specialized senior secondary schools could be a burden for poor students in rural areas. This \ncould affect their decision to continue schooling past grade 9, despite the fact that a large \nmajority of students would probably prefer to stay on at school. \n \n                                                 \n6  Under the project preparatory technical assistance, 180 focus group interviews and discussions were conducted \nwith teachers, students, and parents separately in over 60 schools in all regions of the country.  \n7  According to estimates by the World Bank\u2019s Public Expenditure Review 2004, attendance is at about 70%, while \nofficial figures from MOPE give a rate of over 99%. Field work under the project preparatory technical assistance \nsuggests a rate in between the two figures.  ", "  Appendix 3  31 \n19.  Government Strategy and Policy Framework. Education has been a high priority in \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda and development strategy. Its overall strategic objective has \nbeen to make the education system more responsive and relevant to the requirements of a \nmarket economy and democratic society in the 21st century. In pursuit of this objective, a major \nprogram of education reform was launched in 1997 with the passing of a new education law and \nthe adoption of the National Program for Personnel Training.8 The program identified basic \neducation  as  one  of  the  principal  areas  of  reform  but  concentrated  on  restructuring  and \nstrengthening senior secondary and vocational education during the first and second program \nstages.9 Since then numerous presidential decrees and government resolutions have been \nissued to guide program implementation. Budget allocations for education expenditure have \nrisen since 2000, which stands at 8.4% of gross domestic product in 2005 and is forecast to \ncontinue to rise.  \n \n20.  The unveiling of the National Program for Basic Education Development 2004\u20132009 in \n2004 reaffirms the high priority accorded to basic education and redirects substantial resources \nfor implementing the program including the establishment of the School Development Fund as \nan extrabudgetary fund to finance the National Program for Basic Education Development. The \nprogram aims to overhaul the school system focusing on (i) upgrading poor physical conditions \nand providing key inputs including computer facilities, laboratory equipment, and sport facilities; \n(ii) improving all curricula and syllabuses; (iii) improving teaching methodologies and teaching \ntraining system; and (vi) supporting schools in poor and remote areas.  \n \n21.  The impetus for ICT development was launched by a presidential speech in Parliament \nin  May  2001.  The  Presidential  Degree  of  30  May  2002,  On  Further  Development  of \nComputerization and Introduction of Information and Communication Technologies, established \nthe strategic framework for national ICT development including creating a national ICT Steering \nCommittee  for  its  implementation.10  The  promulgation  of  the  Programme  of  Further \nDevelopment  of  Computerization  and  Introduction  of  Information  and  Communication \nTechnologies for the Period 2002\u2013201011 confirmed the policy directions and basic education as \na priority sector for ICT development. Funding for the initial investment in hardware and systems \nin basic education (estimated at around $120 million over the next 5 years) will come largely \nfrom the School Development Fund but the Government is in negotiations with development \npartners to fund additional hardware provision to the subsector within the next few years. \n \n22.  Strategy  and  Assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Other \nDevelopment Agencies. Consistent with ADB country strategy, basic education is a key area \nof focus of ADB assistance, and ADB is the lead provider of financial assistance in basic \neducation in Uzbekistan. ADB\u2019s sector strategy in education has focused on (i) supporting \nefforts to improve quality, relevance, and access to education; and (ii) enhancing national \ncapacity  to  manage  sector  reforms.12  Accordingly,  policy  dialogue  and  assistance  in  basic \neducation have focused on addressing key issues and challenges of the subsector. ADB has \nprovided five loans since 1997.  \n                                                 \n8  The Constitution of Uzbekistan guarantees free basic education to all citizens.  \n9  Major areas of reform identified by the National Program for Personnel Training include (i) improve preschools and \nbasic education; (ii) rationalize senior secondary and vocational education; (iii) improve educational management \nand financing; and (iv) establish an effective personnel training system. The three stages of implementation begin \nwith the first stage from 1997\u20132001, second from 2002\u20132005, and third from 2006\u20132010. \n10  Uzbek Agency of Communication and Information (UzACI) is the executive for the steering committee. \n11  Cabinet of Ministers Decree 200 of 6 June 2002 plus numerous later attachments. \n12  This approach was commended in a recent independent evaluation of ADB\u2019s country program and operations in \nUzbekistan.  \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n23.  To date, ADB\u2019s assistance has constituted overall comprehensive support to implement \nreforms  in  the  education  sector.  This  includes  (i)  establishing  an  overall  coherent  policy \nframework for the sector, which is the focus of the Education Sector Development Program; (ii) \nimproving governance, education financing and sector reform management, which is woven into \nall ADB projects; (iii) continuing curriculum and assessment improvement, which is a focus of \nthe Second Textbook Development Project;13 (iv) strengthening capacity of teachers and the \nteacher  training  system,  which  is  a  priority  of  both  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram;14 and the Project; (v) meeting critical investment needs in learning materials especially \ntextbooks, school libraries, and ICT facilities, which is a key activity in all projects; and (vi) \nsupporting the poor and disadvantaged, which is a focus of all projects. Technical assistance \nfrom ADB has complemented and supplemented this effort, in particular in the area of institution \nand capacity development.  \n \n24.  ADB has maintained close coordination with other development partners to strengthen \ndevelopment  impact  through  complementary  programs  and  activities.  A  development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 6. German Development Assistance Fund (GTZ) provides \nsupport to the development of vocational education and training. Under its technical assistance \nfor  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  program,  the  European  Union  provides \nassistance  to  the  restructuring  of  the  education  system,  which  covers  education  planning, \nfinancing,  and  management  systems,  with  a  particular  focus  on  vocational  and  higher \neducation. The Japanese government focuses its assistance on training of teachers, equipment \nprovision, and printing textbooks for improving vocational education.  \n \n25.  In  basic  education,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  the  United  Nations \nEducation,  Science  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  are  conducting  a  monitoring  of \nlearning achievements with results due out in August 2005. This will be a timely and useful step \nin improving data on learning outcomes in basic education. The United Nations Development \nProgramme has assisted Uzbekistan in preparing a national strategy for ICT development. The \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  has  two  ongoing  projects:  one  is \nstrengthening learning and teaching, management, and participation at school levels; and the \nother focusing on piloting ICT in schools. The World Bank is preparing its first education project \nfor supporting learning materials development for school libraries, teacher training, community \nparticipation, and school management. ADB has consulted with all of them in preparing the \nProject.  Some  bilateral  partners  provide  support  in  vocational  and  higher  education.  The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China recently concluded an agreement to provide a loan of $19 million to \nUzbekistan in support of the ICT in basic education program. Given the continued progress in \neducation reform and increased presence of external partners, and consistent with the Paris \nDeclaration, ADB has resumed its proactive and lead role in aid coordination. This will be \nsupported by more staff and other resources to ensure that effective coordination will benefit \nUzbekistan in the form of reduced transaction costs and increased efficiency.  \n \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2004.

Pre-Service Teacher Training (PRESETT) \n \n1.  Three types of institution are responsible for providing preservice teacher training for \ngeneral secondary schools. Pedagogical colleges, previously responsible for the training of \nprimary school teachers, are now exclusively responsible for training preschool teachers and \nteachers of \"special\u201d subjects (e.g., music, gymnastics, and art). The 38 pedagogical colleges \nare planned to be reduced to only 25 by the end of 2005. \n \n2.  Primary  and  secondary  preservice  training  is  now  provided  by  five  pedagogical \ninstitutes, 16 faculties of pedagogy, and the Tashkent Pedagogical University. Of these, the \npedagogical institutes and the Pedagogical University generally provide teachers for general \nsecondary  education  and  the  faculties  of  pedagogy  provide  teachers  for  the  specialized \nsecondary schools (the academic lyceums and professional colleges). The Government wishes \nto increase the enrolment capacity of the faculties of pedagogy to ensure sufficient senior \nsecondary teachers for the 12-year educational system, when it becomes compulsory in 2010. \n \nB.  Issues \n \n3.  The National Program for Personnel Training requires all teachers to have at least a first \ndegree.  Most  secondary  school  teachers  meet  this  requirement  but  many  primary  school \nteachers (66,000 or 54% of the total in 2003) do not. Most of these teachers work in rural areas \nand a high proportion are women who find retraining difficult to achieve given their family \ncommitments.  Approximately  15%  of  these  teachers  are  attempting  to  upgrade  their \nqualifications via correspondence courses or distance education \n \n4.  Although teacher supply is considered to be satisfactory, shortages are experienced in \nforeign languages and in mathematics and science in minority language schools. Preservice \nteacher training curricula and syllabi need to be revised to provide for new methodological skills \n(student-centered and activity-based learning) and to support the reform shift away from factual \naccumulation to the development of skills and higher order thinking.  \n \nC.  In-Service Teacher Training \n \n5.  The current in-service training (INSETT) system operates at two levels: (i) the provision \nof residential courses at 16 oblast-based regional in-service teacher training institutes (RITTIs). \nOne RITTI specializes in preschools; the A Avloni Institute in Tashkent is responsible for training \nschool directors, oblast and raion management staff, and oblast and raion methodologists. The \ncourses  are  demand  driven  by  requests  from  schools  to  the  raions;  the  requests  are \nconsolidated and passed to oblasts, where they are again consolidated and passed to the \nMinistry of Public Education (MOPE). MOPE scrutinizes the annual requirement and, based on \nbudget availability, creates an annual INSETT program for each RITTI. The A Avloni Institute in \nTashkent is generally responsible for course development, and Avloni designed courses are \nsent to each RITTI, which can amend or adapt the core courses for their own purposes as \nrequired. All INSETT training in the RITTIs is residential; course duration is generally from 2\u20134 \nweeks. Ordinary teachers are allocated 4 weeks of residential in-service training every 5 years \nin a speciality of their choice (or one agreed with the raion methodologists). Methodologists, \nschool directors, and oblast/raion management staff are allocated 4 weeks of residential in-\nservice training every 3 years; (ii) at the school level, every teacher is paid on the basis that \n20% of their working time will be allocated to continuous professional development (CPD) ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nactivities. In general, every teacher is required to spend 1 day a week on CPD activities. In \nreality,  this  now  often  takes  the  form  of  lesson  preparation,  marking  students\u2019  work,  or \ncompleting the paperwork required for the current student rating system. Because operational \nbudgets in schools and raions/oblasts have deteriorated, the majority of teachers probably no \nlonger engage in meaningful CPD activities on a weekly basis.1 The teacher focus group \ninterviews in the project preparatory technical assistance school survey suggest that many \nteachers feel the need for far more upgrading than they currently receive, particularly on ICT, \nstudent-centred and individual learning, higher order thinking skills, etc. \n  \n6.  The RITTIs are funded by the MOPE budget. A Avloni will receive an annual budget in \n2004/05 of around $0.5 million. This budget is supposed to cover staff salaries (63 permanent \nstaff), course development and printing costs, utilities and maintenance, other operational costs, \ntransport for trainees, and subsistence and accommodation for trainees. In 2004/05 A Avloni will \nprovide approximately 18,000 person-weeks of training to 4,500 trainees. Thus the approximate \nunit cost of 1 week of residential training at the A Avloni ITTI is approximately $28 per person \nper week. A Avloni also houses the Distance Education Development Centre funded by the \nEducation Sector Development Program (ESDP).2 The RITTIs are basically trainers. The A \nAvloni in-service teacher training institute is a course developer and a trainer. None of the \nRITTIs  consider  themselves  to  be  inspectors  and  quality  control  over  the  training  is  not \nexercised by the RITTIs but by MOPE.  \n \n7.  MOPE estimates that 75\u201380% of the RITTIs have modern computer rooms. A Avloni, for \nexample,  has  five  classrooms  each  with  10  Pentium  I  machines.  The  ESDP  will  upgrade \nequipment in the RITTI computer facilities. \n \nD.  Issues \n \n8.  The current system of INSETT is widely considered to be unsatisfactory for the current \ndemands  from  the  education  system3  for  the  following  reasons:  it  is  (i)  inflexible;  (ii)  too \ncentralized; (iii) poorly targeted; (iv) infrequent; and (v) residential, which is a problem for many \nwomen teachers who also have families to look after, particularly in poor rural areas, and who \nwould prefer to have training closer to home and more flexibly delivered. The INSETT system \nneeds to be adjusted to become more flexible; closer to schools; more responsive to a rapidly \nchanging  education  environment  and  the  new  demands  placed  upon  teachers  by  MOPE \npolicies, in line with the personal and professional skills required by teachers, students, schools, \nand parents; and much more highly prioritized and targeted on the key skills needed to support \nreform. Ideally, a revitalized and redirected INSETT system should also provide incentives for \nteachers by providing salary premiums for the achievement of high priority courses/skills \n \n9.  School-based CPD, while conceptually excellent, is failing because of a lack of allocated \nbudgets to provide a comprehensive, high-quality program; and lack of school-based training \nand development activities and facilities, which are in line with current teacher needs. Most \n                                                 \n1  A few teachers have reported that INSETT costs at raion/oblast level have been deducted from their salaries. \n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila.    \n3  The need to adjust and rethink INSETT via the RITTI system is implicit in the objectives of the ESDP. The rector of \nthe A Avloni ITTI also believes that current INSETT is too centralized, too irregular, and too inflexible and that \nreforms are overdue. He argues however that the basic RITTI system should be retained but should be made more \nresponsive to the needs of schools and teachers. The concept of the school clusters restores the continuous \nprofessional development capacity of the system at the school level and should not affect the reforms in INSETT \ncurrently under way via the ESDP. \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nraion methodologists themselves require intensive training in many of the new skills, and most \nteachers are not in a position to develop appropriate skills in other teachers. MOPE also \nconsiders that suitably qualified, appropriately skilled staff are lacking in many of the RITTIs and \nthat intensive programs of inspection, training, and recruitment are necessary. \n \n10.  Meetings  with  the  Teacher  Education  Department  in  MOPE  confirm  that  MOPE  is \nconcerned by current variations in training quality between different RITTIs. A new MOPE \nresolution is in preparation, which will send teams of inspectors to each RITTI to report on \nquality and performance and to recommend improvements. A recent inspection of the Khorezm \nin-service teacher training institute comprised two representatives from MOPE, two from other \nRITTIs, and one oblast deputy director of education. A RITTI rectors council meets every 2 \nmonths, chaired by the first deputy minister of education. It provides a forum for raising issues of \nconcern.  \n \n11.  MOPE considers that variations in INSETT quality within the RITTI system have the \nfollowing  causes:  (i)  lack  of  suitably  trained  staff  (only  10%  of  RITTI  staff  have  higher \nqualifications; 34% are basically qualified while 56% are considered to be underqualified); (ii) \nRITTI staff are themselves in urgent need of training and upgrading; (iii) a number of the oblast \nRITTIs have substandard facilities; and (iv) inadequate operational budgets tend to operate \nagainst the consistent delivery of high quality in-service teacher training. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "   Appendix 5   \nCOMPLEMENTARITY AMONG ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECTS \n \n  Information and Communications Technology in Basic Education Project (ICTBEP) Components \n  1.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan:  \n \nThe Project aims to improve quality, relevance, and equitable access to basic education for all students, including \nstudents in poor and remote areas. The Project will contribute to the following social development outcomes: (i) enable \nstudents and educators to participate more effectively in the knowledge-based economy by virtue of enhanced \nproblem-solving skills, improved capacity to study independently, ability to work with information, and ability to apply \nkey skills in real job settings; (ii) support the creation of new electronic materials that help the teachers to shift to a \nstudent-centered learning environment in which teachers play a learning facilitator role; (iii) ensure that all students \nhave access to quality educational materials through e-learning and support conditions for equal access to      (ICT) \nwith enhanced education services based on ICT; (iv) develop teacher and education management capacity to \nincorporate new educational technology into teaching practice, produce learning materials, and use ICT-based \nmanagement system; and (v) improve the existing     (INSETT) system to be closer to users, more flexible, and more \nfrequent, thus more effective. \n \nThe Project will have a direct beneficial impact on about 130,000 poor students in grades 5\u20139 enrolled in the 700 \nduring 2006\u20132011.1 Specific pro-poor measures of the Project include (i) having about 70% of the 860 CLSs from poor \nschools; (ii) improved power supply to all schools, which will ensure proper working of the ICT facilities installed, as \nwell as meet general lighting and heating needs during the winter;2 (iii) pilot testing connectivity especially for rural and \nremote areas; (iv) facilitating access to rural teachers, students, and local communities; and (v) opening ICT facilities \nin schools to local communities, which will benefit an estimated 1 million households. The Project will provide ICT \nfacilities and internet connections to all schools, rich and poor, urban and rural. This is pro-poor since it will help bridge \nthe internal digital divide. The Project will address the issue of increasing parental contributions, which burdens the \npoor disproportionately, by ensuring that the full costs of ICT in schools are borne by the public sector with no parental \ncontributions required for ICT use in schools.  \n \nIn 2000 Uzbekistan signed the Dakar Framework for Action and in 2003 published the National Action Plan for \nEducation for All. The action plan supports the basic principle of inclusion and integration of children with special \nneeds into the general education system. The Department for Special Education of the Ministry of Public Education \nsubmitted a draft resolution to the Government at the end of March 2005 aiming to provide a formal policy framework \nand strategy for enhancing education quality and conditions for children with special needs. The Project will pilot \ninclusive education through (i) public education and awareness campaign, and policy dialogue; (ii)         (CLSs) to \ninclude training and e-materials for children with special needs; and (iii) linking the pilot project with other related Asian \nDevelopment Bank projects such as RITTI course development activities under the ESDP and provision of teaching \nmaterials i.e., Braille textbooks to schools under the STDP. \n \nThe incorporation of ICT into the schools can greatly benefit community involvement in school activities. The school \nwill provide the possibility for parents to gain access to technology and training. Hence, the schools with ICT can \nbecome part of larger initiatives to offer technology access to communities, particularly in rural areas. Up to 1 million \nhouseholds are expected to be able to access ICT via community access schemes such as a telecenters or school-\nbased internet cafes.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe World Bank Living Standard Assessment (2003) shows that an estimated 27.5% of the population or 6.8 million \npeople live at or below the poverty line. Of these, approximately one third or 2.3 million people are classified as \nextremely poor.  Poverty is significantly higher in rural than in urban areas  (30.5% versus 22.5%) and 69% of the poor  \n \n                                                 \n1  This assumes that 27% of the students on average are from poor families, a poverty indicator based on the Living \nStandard Assessment of the World Bank 2003.  \n2  Lack of heating in winter is cited as one reason that some parents do not let their children go to school in winter.  \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n \nand 72% of the extreme poor are found in rural Uzbekistan. Poverty is also associated with specific regions. Thus \npoverty is relatively low in the Tashkent region (9.2%) and relatively very high in Kashkadarya (62.6%) and in \nKarakalpakstan (36.4%). This is partly the result of environmental factors but also of a bias in public policy that has \nallocated far more public investment, credit, subsidies, and other scarce resources to the urban areas while broadly \nneglecting rural areas.3 \n \nThe survey of 30 makhallas (communities) during the project preparatory technical assistance shows that the \nincidence of poverty also has remarkable regional contrast within oblasts. The incidence of economically vulnerable \nfamilies varied from 97% in one makhallas in Yosobon raion, Fergana oblast to 2% in Shaykhantokhur raion in \nTashkent City. Within Fergana oblast two raions recorded the incidence of economically vulnerable families at 7%, \nwhile the third estimated at 97%. However, a high proportion of the poor in Uzbekistan tend to be rich in human \ncapital. Thus most have at least 9 years of education. The survey indicates that poor households are distinguished by \nthe following features: (i) high unemployment or underemployment, (ii) minimum educational qualifications, (iii) more \nthan three children per family, (iv) reduced access to land of good quality, and (v) less integrated into the market \neconomy. \n \nPoverty and social assessments were carried out to inform project design. They revealed the following: (i) inequality \nand inequity in access (digital divide) in the regions from geographic perspective: between rural and urban schools \nand between rich and poor schools and households; (ii) access to ICT is very limited both in urban and rural schools, \nwhich hinders future generations of Uzbek students from have the necessary skills to participate fully in the knowledge \neconomy; (iii) demand for parental contribution for ICT could be a severe financial problem for the poor; (iv) \ndecentralization of the education budget\u2014only 5 of 14 oblasts are self sufficient in taxation and the central budget is \nused as a safety net to provide support for oblasts that cannot balance their budgets; (v) lack of infrastructure such as \nreliable power supplies, nonsecure wiring from computer installation, and 82% of schools have never seen or used a \nmodern IBM compatible computer; and (vi) lack of teachers\u2019 knowledge on use of ICT. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe main stakeholder groups are students, teachers, education managers (both administrators within the education \nsystem and policymakers), teacher educators, developers of learning materials, private sector groups dealing in ICT, \nteacher educators both preservice and in-service, parent-teacher associations, and communities. During the project \ndesign  and  preparation  phase,  stakeholders  participated  as  members  of  working  groups  to  design  various \ncomponents, and participated in workshops and in preparing implementation plans. Three national workshops, 180 \nfocus group discussions in all 14 regions of the country, which involved over 40 makhallas and 60 schools, were held \nduring the preparation phase. The project design also involved consultations with nongovernment organizations and \nother civil society organizations.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nNational  public  campaign  to  ensure  that  all  stakeholders  especially  teachers,  parents,  students,  educators, \npolicymakers, private sector, and civil society organizations are fully informed will be conducted during project \nimplementation. The campaign will be launched to complement the National Conference on ICT in Basic Education \nscheduled for November 2005, with regular updates on progress of implementation throughout the first 2 years of \nproject implementation.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nUzbekistan has made efforts to ensure that its inherited good education indicators and are maintained. Universal \naccess to basic primary and secondary school education (grades 1\u20139) has been maintained, and the literacy rate is \nalmost 100% for men and women. According to the Household Baseline Survey (2001/02) data, approximately 92% of \nmen and 93% of women in the 25\u201334 year-old age group had some upper secondary or higher levels of schooling. \nThe interim Report on Welfare Improvement Strategy of the Republic of Uzbekistan (2005) showed that the enrolment \nrates between boys and girls (90.9% of boys and 90.5% of girls) are equal. However, the quality of education at all \nlevels of education is not being maintained. \n \n                                                 \n3  Corniaga. 2003.

The Project will ensure that \ngirls and boys have equal access to all required learning e-materials and ICT. The improved INSETT system, which is \ncloser to schools and more flexible, will benefit at least 12,600 women teachers who account for 70% of the teaching \nforce in CLSs, with far more women of teachers in the school system to be benefited during the life of the Project. In \naddition other issues with gender implications to be monitored include analysis of education materials for gender \nbiases and stereotyping women. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
