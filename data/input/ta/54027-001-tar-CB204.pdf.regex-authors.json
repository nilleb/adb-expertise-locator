The proposed project will support the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s \n \nefforts to promote sustainable and resilient agricultural and food systems by addressing the \nconstraints across three levels, the enabling environment (institutional, governance and policy), \nthe production bases and the value chain to transform the way food is produced, processed and \ndelivered to consumers. These systems will provide a more secure livelihood base for the rural \npopulation  as  the  drivers  for  economic  growth,  higher  rural  incomes,  and  employment \nopportunities, meet increased food security demands and contribute to achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. Additional benefits will see a closing of the gap between rural and urban \nareas with increased livelihood and income opportunities, which will in part be supported by \nincreased  private  sector  agribusinesses  as  the  new  leaders  in  agricultural  value  chain \ndevelopment. The proposed project will be implemented in the Yellow River basin, through the \nparticipating seven provinces and two autonomous regions. \n   \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist in preparing the \nYellow River Ecological Corridor and Climate Resilient Agriculture Development.

Project innovations are delivered through supporting stronger institutions for cross-sector \ncooperation  to  deliver  sustainable  and  resilient  agricultural  and food systems  that  balance \nenvironmental health with economic development to build stronger and safer rural economies. \nADB will apply a one-ADB approach cooperating with Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department to find examples of best practices in developing member countries and with \nPrivate Sector Operations Department to explore private sector linkages for agribusiness for value \nchain development. The project incorporates lessons to balance the importance of agriculture and \nthe environment, such as (i) applying climate-smart agricultural practices, (ii) promoting sound \nmanagement practices for conservation and enhanced management of natural resources, and \n(iii) enhanced coordination and protection measures to create ecological corridors to improve river \nbasin health.  \nC.
