INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming meeting in November 2011, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA)1 to support the Shanghai Environment and Energy \nExchange (SEEE) in analyzing some key elements of its proposed emission trading system \n(ETS) and recommend policy measures for carbon market development.2 During the fact-finding \nmission  on  4\u20136  September  2012,  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  financial  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA were agreed with the SEEE. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Climate change caused by rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has emerged as a \nmajor threat to sustainable development. Asia and the Pacific was the region most affected by \nclimate  change-induced  natural  disasters  during  2000\u20132009,  accounting  for  85%  of  global \nfatalities associated with natural disasters. The negative impacts of climate change are widely \nexpected to fall disproportionately on the vulnerable and on poor communities. Climate change \nhas become one of the main drivers of massive migration and displacement in the region. \nHence, mitigating climate change is an urgent task to support environmentally sustainable \ngrowth in the region. \n \n3.  The PRC is a significant contributor to climate change, responsible for more than 20% of \nglobal  emissions  in  2011  compared  with  less  than  11%  in  1990.  This  rapid  rise  in  GHG \nemissions is the result of energy-intensive growth. Recognizing the threat posed by rapidly \nincreasing GHG emissions, the PRC reduced its energy intensity by 19.1% during 2006\u20132010.3 \nThe government also announced the reduction of its carbon intensity by 40%\u201345% in 2020 \ncompared with 2005. 4 The Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) set a target to reduce carbon \nintensity  by  17%  and  energy  intensity  by  a  further  16%.  While  administrative  measures \nachieved significant results during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), these need to be \ncomplemented  by  more  market-oriented  approaches  to  provide  economic  incentives  for \nemission reductions. One such approach is an ETS to enable the trading of emission reductions \nbetween enterprises that have obligations for emission reduction. Compared with other GHG \nemission control measures, ETSs offer greater flexibility to determine the price of carbon by \nusing  market  measures.  They  allow  targeted  installations  to  meet  their  carbon  reduction \nobligations  by  purchasing  cost-effective  carbon  reduction  from  other  installations.  Many \njurisdictions have implemented or plan to implement ETSs.5 Among these jurisdictions, the \nEuropean  Union  ETS  is  widely  recognized  as  the  first  and  biggest  international  scheme, \ncovering some 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 July 2012. \n2  The TA is included as Study on Shanghai Carbon Finance Development in ADB. 2012. Country Operations \nBusiness Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n3  Energy intensity is the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). \n4  Carbon intensity is the amount of GHG emitted per unit of GDP. \n5  Jurisdictions that have ETS implementation in place include the European Union; New South Wales, Australia; \nAlberta, Canada; Tokyo, Japan; New Zealand; Norway; Switzerland; California, the United States; Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative in several eastern states of the United States; United Kingdom Carbon Reduction \nCommitment Scheme; and Western Climate Initiative in the western states of the United States and some \nprovinces of western Canada. The countries with plans to introduce a national ETS include Brazil, Japan, and the \nRepublic of Korea. \n ", "2  \n4.  The Government of the PRC recognized the benefits of an ETS, which it considers a \ncost-effective  way  to  balance  economic  growth  and  climate  change  challenges.  Given  the \ncomplexities and uncertain economic impacts of ETS, the government proposed piloting cap-\nand-trade system for carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions in selected economic sectors and regions \n2\nbefore  introducing  a  nationwide  ETS.  The  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \nrequested five cities with high carbon intensities\u2014Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, \nand Tianjin\u2014along with the provinces of Guangdong and Hubei to set emissions control targets \nand submit proposals on pilot ETSs. \n \n5.  Shanghai is one of the PRC\u2019s largest cities. It has a gross domestic product (GDP) of \nCNY1.92 trillion\u2014about 4% of the national GDP\u2014and a per capita GDP of CNY82,560 in 2011.6 \nShanghai emitted about 188 million tons of CO  and major sources are thermal power sector \n2\n(37%), industry (30%), and transport (20%).7 The SEEE estimates that the total CO  emissions \n2\nwill  increase  to  330  million  tons  in  2020  based  on  expected  GDP  growth.  The  Shanghai \nMunicipal Government (SMG) recognized the importance of reducing carbon intensity and has \nset the 12th plan targets for reducing carbon intensity by 19% and energy intensity by 18% by \n2015. The SMG considers the ETS a crucial market-based approach to achieve these targets. \nThe SMG aims to build on its success in establishing the SEEE,8 which now handles about 70% \nof environmental commodities transactions in the PRC. An ETS is a natural fit for Shanghai\u2019s \nhighly  diversified  industry  and  fully  developed  commercial  sector,  which  provide  the  core \ncompetencies needed to plan, implement, and operate such a complex scheme. \n \n6.  The pilot Shanghai ETS will be an extension of the existing SEEE. The SMG envisages \nShanghai as the future leader in the carbon market with a comprehensive market platform for \nenvironment and energy transactions both nationally and internationally. Driven by this vision, \nthe Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, the Shanghai Development and Reform Commission, \nand SEEE requested ADB to provide TA to assist the SEEE in (i) assessing the impacts of an \nETS  on  the  Shanghai  economy  and  key  sectors,  (ii)  recommending  sector-specific \nbenchmarking methods and other system design elements of the ETS, 9 and (iii) identifying \nfuture innovative and tradable carbon finance products that can potentially be linked to the \nShanghai ETS to ensure its sustainability and enhance the further development of the Shanghai \ncarbon market.  \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  support  for  market-driven  emissions  reduction,  cost-\neffective carbon finance, and carbon market development in developing member countries. The \nTA is a logical next step following ADB\u2019s support to the Ministry of Environmental Protection to \nassist in the establishment of a national sulfur dioxide emissions trading system in the PRC.10 It \n                                                 \n6  Shanghai Statistics Bureau. 2012.

SEEE is a specialized equity-capital market platform for transactions of asset rights, \ncreditor\u2019s rights, stock rights, and intellectual property rights focusing on environment and energy. \n9  In ETS, a benchmark is used to identify a threshold for the level of free allocation of an individual installation. \nUsually, benchmarks are developed per product for each targeted sector. In the European Union ETS, a product \nbenchmark is based on a value reflecting the average GHG performance of the 10% best performing installations \nin each sector. A sector-specific benchmarking method is often used for new entrants to the ETS to determine their \nfree allocation as they do not have historical data on GHG performance.  \n10 ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nalso complements ongoing ADB support for green finance development in Beijing11 and the \ndevelopment of an ETS in Tianjin.12 The TA will incorporate lessons learned from two other \nongoing TAs in Beijing and Tianjin that are in early stage implementation through close and \neffective communications with SEEE. These three related interventions in Beijing, Tianjin, and \nShanghai target vital yet different elements of the ETS. ADB support is needed in parallel as the \nthree cities have major concentrations of emissions and different emissions mixes. Successful \nand early ETS application in these major PRC cities is crucial to accelerate a nationwide ETS \nimplementation, which will lead to a more environmentally sustainable development in the PRC.  \n \n8.  The TA is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which identifies climate change \nmitigation through energy efficiency improvement and mitigation of GHG emissions as a core \narea  of  operation. 13  The  PRC\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015,  promotes \nenvironmental sustainability as one of the two pillars of ADB assistance to the PRC.14 Improving \nenergy intensity by using energy more efficiently and reducing carbon intensity have been \nidentified as key interventions in this regard. Innovation and knowledge products to support \npolicy reforms in order to establish an enabling environment for private sector development and \nclean energy investment are consistent with the PRC\u2019s country partnership strategy. Piloting an \nETS in one of the major cities of the PRC\u2014the world\u2019s largest GHG emitter\u2014will contribute \nsignificantly to global public goods by mitigating climate change. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be a more environmentally sustainable development in Shanghai. The \noutcome will be an established carbon trading platform in Shanghai. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  is  designed  to  assist  the  SEEE  in  undertaking  the  pilot  Shanghai  ETS \ndevelopment  and  to  seek  opportunities  to  enhance  the  Shanghai  carbon  market.  The  TA \ncomprises the outputs and associated key activities described in paras. 11\u201314. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Comprehensive  assessment  of  Shanghai  emission  trading  system \nimpacts on targeted sectors and city economy. The TA will conduct an assessment of the \nlikely economic impacts of a Shanghai ETS on the targeted sectors and city economy by \ndeveloping a model with different emission cap scenarios. Based on the modeling results, the \nTA will recommend a cap and initial allocations for selected sectors. \n \n12.  Output  2:  A  policy  brief  on  sector-specific  benchmarking  methods  for  the \nShanghai pilot emission trading system. The TA will conduct extensive research on various \nbenchmarking methods used in other ETSs and propose sector-specific benchmarking methods \nthat are suitable for the Shanghai pilot ETS. The initial benchmarking proposal will be shared \n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2010.
