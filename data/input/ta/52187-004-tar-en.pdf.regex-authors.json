The proposed technical assistance (TA) will complement the loan to Credo Bank JSC \n(Credo) for low-income housing finance of up to $25,000,000 or its lari equivalent. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will provide long-term financing to Credo to support affordable long-\nterm housing finance. Credo will focus on funding home renovation and construction in rural areas \nand the periphery of the capital, targeting low-income clients. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  In March 2017, Credo obtained a commercial banking license from the National Bank of \nGeorgia.  Through  its  68  service  centers,  Credo  is  a  leading  financial  service  provider  for \nhouseholds as well as micro and small enterprises (MSEs), serving 230,000 MSE borrowers, of \nwhom 50% are female, with an average loan size of GEL2,300. The rationale behind the bank\u2019s \ntransformation was to scale up lending to MSEs and cater to the growing and more diversified \nclient needs, while leveraging its large customer base, of which more than half are female, to \nattract local currency deposits and offer full-scale retail banking products. Credo believes that its \nclients have significant potential to grow their income and livelihood through better understanding \nand management of business and finances, under challenging conditions in the rural economy. \nSince most of the female labor force works in the rural economy, a special focus on women is \nwarranted.  \n \n3.  Credo\u2019s traditional branch distribution channels need to be augmented by modern fintech \nsolutions  to  reach  out  to  customers  efficiently,  especially  in  remote  rural  areas.  Low-cost \nbranchless service channels such as internet and mobile banking are essential to facilitate timely \nand convenient service delivery. Credo also needs to broaden its lending service focus by offering \nsavings,  insurance, cash  management,  and  payment  services.  A  branchless  approach  will \nparticularly benefit females, as Credo moves from a microcredit approach to a full-service bank. \n \n4.  In 2015, Credo established an in-house academy to train its staff. It plans to expand its \nmandate and recalibrate its training curriculum to build the necessary skills for:  \n(i)  staffs\u2019 management and leadership skills in the regions; \n(ii)  staff in providing full banking services beyond credit, such as mobile payments, \ntransfers, savings, and deposits; \n(iii)  village counselors, who are the main intermediaries to identify clients in rural \ncommunities; and \n(iv)  building business planning and financial skills of its customers, with an emphasis \non female clients.  \n \n5.  With the support of the TA, Credo aims to achieve the following results by 2022: \n \na.  Training  \n \n(i)  Academy facilities providing an annual training capacity of 2,500 trainees; \n(ii)  At least 2,500 staff and 120 middle managers benefit from full banking services \nand management training annually; \n(iii)  At least 1,300 village counselors, of which 35% are women, have been trained in \nfull banking service offerings through the academy; \n ", "2 \n(iv)  At least 10,000 women benefitting from financial literacy training via \u201cvillage day\u201d \n(marketing) events; and \n(v)  At least 1,600 female customers per year receive rural tourism business training. \n \nb.  Service outreach and utilization \n \n(i)  A Fintech solution offering full banking services in at least 1,300 Georgian villages \nis fully functional (2020); \n(ii)  Half of Credo\u2019s clients use branchless services and at least 70% of whom are \nsatisfied with the service quality; and \n(iii)  The number of rural women using branchless banking services reaches 30,000, of \nwhom at least 70% are satisfied with the service quality. \n \nc.  Impact \n \n(i)  Market surveys in 2021 and 2023 will measure the success of the training program \n(with a special focus on female beneficiaries) via improved business sales and \nfinancial management skills; and \n(ii)  Credo will adjust the training curriculum as necessary based on the market surveys. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \nOutput 1: Mobile banking solution provides full banking service outreach to rural \nareas.  \n \n6.  Under the TA, Credo will establish its internet and mobile banking service channel to \nenable  its  retail  customers  in  rural  areas  to  manage  accounts,  cards,  and  loans;  perform \npayments; and manage personal finance. Its MSE customers will be able to manage cash, \ncorporate payments, transaction approvals, salary processing, accounts, and loan management \nthrough the system. The branchless system will particularly benefit female customers in rural \nareas with difficult access to branches, thereby improving outreach to remote villages and \nreducing transaction costs for clients. Credo\u2019s lending services will also benefit from mobile \nbanking applications, and loan officers will use mobile devices and applications to process and \ndisburse loans as well as cross-selling other banking services on-site. Disbursements will be \ncredited to cards made available to customers providing cash through Credo\u2019s branches and \nGeorgia\u2019s automated teller machine infrastructure and point of sale terminals. The introduction of \na branchless banking solution will require a review and adaptation of the existing business \nprocesses, which will also form part of this TA.  \n \nOutput 2: Training Targeted at Women Customers \n \nOutput 2.1: Credo Academy.  \n \n7.  Credo will train its regional middle managers, relationship and loan officers, and village \ncounselors to ensure that full banking services are delivered to Credo\u2019s target clientele. Topics \nwill cover (i) sales and marketing, (ii) responsible finance, (iii) relationship management and \ncommunication, (iv) leadership coaching for managers, and (v) full banking product and service \nofferings. Training will be carried out by internal trainers and consultants with at least 5 years of \nexperience in the respective field.   \n   \n ", "3 \nOutput 2.2: Financial literacy training via village days.  \n \n8.  Credo will augment its marketing-focused village days, which cover 60 events per year in \nrural Georgia, by introducing financial literacy and business skills training modules targeted at \nwomen. The topics will cover basic accounting and planning, budgeting, and marketing for \nbusinesswomen.  Training  will  also  provide  information  on  the  benefits  of  service  offerings \ncovering credit and deposit and payment services. The training aims to improve rural women\u2019s \nability to:  \n(i)  distinguish between usurious offers and responsible finance practice;  \n(ii)  understand their need for credit and debt service capacity; and  \n(iii)  improve their business skills beyond subsistence activities.  \n \nOutput 2.3 Business skills training for women clients in rural tourism.  \n \n9.  Credo will also prepare a training curriculum targeted at prospective rural customers \nparticipating in its housing finance and home renovation program, including the benefits of income \ngeneration via agritourism. Designed predominantly for women who run small homestays and \nguesthouses, this program will augment basic business management skills via training in basic \naccounting, budgeting, service management, marketing, and the use of sustainable technologies. \nFrom 2019 to 2021, an expected 3,200 clients in Kazbegi, Svaneti, Adjara, Bakuriani, and Borjomi \nregions will benefit from the program. This training program will be provided in the context of the \nvillage days marketing context in the targeted regions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.3 million, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will delegate the administration of the TA to Credo Bank, which will be the executing \nagency.

TA implementation is expected to begin in January 2019 and be completed by 31 December \n2023. \n \n13.  The execution of the TA requires the selection of consultants. ADB will monitor the \nselection and procurement steps, check that the use of funds complies with relevant ADB policies, \nand check that outputs for development effectiveness are on track. \n \n14.  Credo and ADB will enter into a TA agreement that sets out the terms and conditions for \nthe TA, including Credo\u2019s responsibilities in selecting, contracting, and managing the consultants, \nand auditing procedures, in a manner acceptable to ADB.
