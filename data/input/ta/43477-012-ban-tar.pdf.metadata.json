Justification \n \n1.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is necessary to effectively formulate \nthe Capital Market Development Program II which will support the Government\u2019s commitment to a \nmeaningful capital market reform. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will engage international and domestic consultants who will \nwork closely with the Government, market participants, and ADB in the 4 areas below. This will \nalso  encapsulate  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  recent  stock  market  volatility  in  Bangladesh  and \nrecommend mitigation measures to ensure stock market stability: \n \n(i)  Improved  legal  and  regulatory  structure.  The  first  component  will  assist  the \nGovernment in setting a legal and financial supervisory policy that strikes the right \nbalance in financial regulation and enhances the stability of the Bangladesh financial \nsystem. The PPTA will assist in developing options such as demutualization and \nother  related  measures  to  remove  inherent  conflicts  of  interest,  eliminate \nopportunities for arbitrage between the stock exchanges, and enhance liquidity and \npublic trust. The PPTA will focus on options for legal and regulatory reforms as well \nas benchmarking regulatory efforts against international standards. This will also \ninclude the development of a more systematic and institutionalized approach to \ninter-agency  cooperation  and  coordination  among  financial  regulators,  including \nBangladesh Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Structural \nand  institutional  issues  such  as  limited  SEC  autonomy  will  be  analyzed  and \nmeasures will be recommended to alleviate such issues.   \n \n(ii)  Bond market development and deepening the scope of securitization. The \nsecond component will analyze impediments to the development of a liquid debt \nmarket and recommend a debt market strategy that will foster a deep, liquid, and \ntransparent debt market offering a wide range of products. On the supply side, \nemphasis will be placed on increasing the supply of high quality corporate paper \nbuilding on the benchmark yield curve of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \ntradable securities and thereby improving the functioning and efficiency of the fixed \nincome market. This component will also focus on developing competitive pricing of \nprimary issuances including promoting the role of credit rating agencies and the use \nof credit enhancement products or risk mitigation instruments. On the demand side, \ninitiatives to increase the demand for corporate securities will be assessed including \nthrough unit trusts and contractual savings institutions. Regional experiences in \ndeveloping resilient, liquid bond markets will be considered while formulating the \nstrategy. The role of mutual funds in promoting capital market development and \nbond market development will also be explored. As a logical sequence of this \ncomponent, efforts will also focus on developing the securitization market. The \nPPTA will review the current legal and market structure for securitization, create \nawareness, and facilitate a few asset-backed securitized transactions for promoting \nthe securitization market. \n \n(iii)  Development  of  successful  financial  instrument  tax  policies.  The  third \ncomponent will involve a systematic analysis of the current tax structure of financial \ninstruments. It will recommend measures that are compatible with financial market \n ", "2 \n \ndevelopment\u2014and that also do not violate tax principles\u2014to remove distortions \nbetween different types of financial assets. The potential impacts of a tax-neutral \nstructure will be assessed and the likely benefits of such a structure will be weighed \nagainst the likely costs. This will be substantiated by an analysis of successful \nfinancial instrument tax policies elsewhere in the region. A sequenced action plan \nwill be developed that is compatible with financial market development.  \n \n(iv)  Development  of  derivatives.  This  component  will  focus  on  developing  the \nderivative industry\u2014particularly bond futures, interest rate derivatives, exchange \nrate derivatives, and equity derivatives. The fourth component will help determine \nthe capital adequacy, position limits, margin requirements, and sales practices to be \nadopted  by  dealers  for  derivatives.  This  component  will  also  ensure  that  the \nstructure of regulation and risk management in the derivatives market meets the \nmarket requirement.  \n \n3.
