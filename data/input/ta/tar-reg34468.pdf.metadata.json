INTRODUCTION\n1. The 2000 Pacific Strategy for the New Millenium1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nemphasizes support for private sector development as a priority development area for the\nPacific. In this connection, during 2000, ADB staff have met  with a wide range of private sector\nstakeholders  in  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs),2  as  well  as  the  Foreign\nInvestment Advisory Service (FIAS),3 the South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF),4 and the South\nPacific Trade Commission in Sydney.5 These consultations highlighted the need to first identify,\non  a  regional  basis,  the  range  of  common  though  specific  impediments  to  private  sector\ndevelopment in the Pacific. This regional technical assistance (TA)6 has been formulated to\naddress the need to identify such impediments. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. ADB\u2019s 1996-1999 Strategy for the Pacific had identified the need for private sector\ndevelopment in the PDMCs. Emphasis however, was given to policy support for creating an\nenvironment conducive for private sector development\u2014an environment characterized by stable\nand credible economic policies with strong regulatory and legislative frameworks. Hence, during\n1996-1999, economic policy analysis and advice has been the centerpiece of ADB\u2019s assistance,\nparticularly in PDMCs that are committed to economic reform, such as the Cook Islands,\nFederal States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu.\n3. Much  has  been  achieved  during  1996-1999  on  enhancing  the  environment  for  the\nprivate sector in the Pacific, mostly at a macro level. Economic policies specially designed to\nattract foreign direct investments to PDMCs have been implemented. The size and scope of the\npublic sector has been reduced in a number of countries in the expectation that this would make\nplace for private investment. However, the response of the private sector to these initiatives\nremains disappointing because the macro policies need to be complemented with micro level\ninterventions that specifically address the peculiar constraints facing PDMCs. Such constraints\ninclude a narrow resource base, limited human resources, and modest sized markets. The 2000\nPacific Strategy for the New Millenium  acknowledges  these  constraints  and  the  need  for\ncomplementary micro-level interventions.\n4. ADB  has  also  sought  opportunities  to  provide  direct  assistance  to  private  sector\ndevelopment. Given the generally small size (by ADB standards) of potential projects in the\nPacific, ADB helped establish an investment vehicle, the Kula Fund,7 which provides equity and\ndebt financing for projects with capital requirements in excess of $200,000. However, even the\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2000. Pacific Strategy for the New Millenium. Approved by Management on 11 October.\n2  The term PDMCs refers to the Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Federal States of Micronesia, Republic of the\nMarshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Tonga, and Vanuatu.\n3  FIAS, established by the International Finance Corporation in Sydney, assists governments to attract foreign direct\ninvestment through provision of advice on laws, policies, incentives, and strategies concerning foreign investments.\n4  SPPF is a Sydney-based advisory service, funded by the International Finance Corporation, Australia, Japan, New\nZealand, and the PDMCs, is responsible for providing business and technical advice to private companies and\nentrepreneurs in various PDMCs.\n5  The Fact-Finding Mission (A. Iffland, Project Economist and Mission Leader) visited Australia during 1-5 November\n2000 to identify the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\n6  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on 31 July 2000.\n7   Inv. REG 7136: Pacific Investment Capital Fund, for $3.0 million, approved on 29 April 1997.", "2\nKula Fund does not respond to the needs of the more numerous smaller companies, that\nconstitute the majority of private companies in PDMCs. This concern remains to be addressed.\n5. Another  parallel  ADB  intervention  for  the  private  sector  in  the  Pacific  has  been\ncontinuing  support  to  specialized  regional  agencies  such  as  the  SPPF  and  FIAS  through\nprovision of TA.8\n6. At a micro level, among the many constraints facing private sector development in the\nPacific, three that particularly stand out are the needs for  (i) appropriate business development\nservices (BDS) to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), (ii) innovative approaches in the\nprovision of adequate financial services to SMEs that are appropriate in the Pacific context, and\n(iii) governments to eliminate \u201cred tape\u201d and simplify investment processes.\n7. Traditionally, funding agencies and governments have and continue to intervene in BDS\nmarkets at the transaction level\u2014directly providing services to SMEs via public BDS providers,\nor permanently subsidizing services delivered by private BDS providers. Traditional approaches\nhave failed to achieve adequate outreach, since the number of SMEs served is limited by the\namount  of  subsidies  available.  In  addition,  institutional  sustainability  has  been  low,  since\nprograms cease when public funds are exhausted. Further, there is limited understanding about\nthe principles of good practice in BDS institutions to achieve outreach and sustainability in\nPDMCs, and little is known about the existing market for BDS\u2014the gaps in the provision of\nservices, the reasons for the lack of demand for and the supply of services, and the extent of\nmarket distortions. This understanding of BDS markets is critical when choosing the \u201cright\u201d\nintervention instrument and strategy, and is needed to identify local institutions and regional\nnetworks to build upon. The challenge is to gain these insights into the BDS market in PDMCs\nand determine the features of sustainable BDS in the Pacific context.\n8. SME finance continues to be a major concern in PDMCs. In the Pacific, and other parts\nof the world, commercial banks commonly restrict their lending activities to well-secured short-\nterm  working  capital  finance,  personal  loans,  and/or  housing  finance.  The  performance  of\ndevelopment banks in their traditional role as providers of medium-term debt finance to the\nprivate  sector  varies  considerably  but  is  generally  less  than  satisfactory.  International\ndevelopment institutions as Commonwealth Development Corporation, the International Finance\nCorporation, and the European Investment Bank provide foreign currency term finance, but\nsuch lending is usually available only to larger companies. The same applies to the Kula Fund\n(footnote 7): its equity finance starts at $200,000, and is too large for small enterprises, which\ncomprise the majority of the private sector. On the other end of the scale is the emerging\nmicrofinance subsector. Government schemes, nongovernment organizations, and aid-funded\nprojects provide mainly group-guaranteed micro loans with an average loan size of $500. This,\ntoo, leaves unattended the finance requirements of small enterprises, which range from about\n$2,000-$200,000.\n9. Local and foreign investors, established and budding entrepreneurs alike, irrespective of\nthe size and nature of their business, experience problems arising from red tape.  Regulations\nintended to facilitate private business activities turn out to be more burdensome than intended\nor  anticipated.  In  addition,  public  servants  are  either  unwilling  or  unable  to  respond  to\nentrepreneurs in a client-oriented fashion, causing costly delays in issuing permits, certificates,\n                                                \n8  TA 5683-REG: South Pacific Project Facility, for $300,000, approved on 26 April 1996; TA 5891-REG: South Pacific\nProject Facility II, for $300,000, approved on 23 December 1999. TA 5759-REG: Investment Promotion in the Pacific\nDeveloping Member Countries, for $200,000, approved on 4 November 1997.", "3\nand other documents required by governments. Complaints and frustrations are numerous and\nare frequently aired by private sector representatives. Nonetheless, little has been done to\nremove red tape and change the attitude of public servants, and little is known in PDMCs about\npossible approaches and mechanisms to address these issues.\n10. This TA is designed to respond to such concerns of the typical small-scale private sector\ninvestor in the Pacific, investors who comprise the vast majority of potential investors in the\nregion. The emphasis will be on finding local solutions through a dialogue with governments and\nthe private sector.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n11. ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy emphasizes the importance of the private sector as the engine of\ngrowth to achieve poverty reduction in PDMCs. In accordance with this broad objective, the TA\nwill assist the private sector and the Governments to address major impediments to private\nsector development as a means of creating greater employment and faster economic growth in\nthe region.\nB.  Scope\n12. The TA will (i) carry out a detailed analysis of nonfinancial BDS for foreign and local\nSMEs in the primary, secondary, and tertiary sector in the PDMCs; (ii) review financial services\navailable to SMEs, identifying most appropriate financial products and delivery mechanisms; (iii)\nidentify  red  tape  hindering  private  sector  development  in  selected  PDMCs  and  propose  a\nmechanism  to  assist  governments  and  the  private  sector  to  systematically  address  their\nremoval; (iv) conduct a series of regional and national private sector stakeholder meetings and\nconferences to (a) learn about the best international practices in BDS and financial services for\nSMEs, (b) review findings and recommendations under (i-iii) above, and (c) prepare a plan of\naction to implement jointly agreed upon recommendations; and (v) compile and disseminate a\nbusiness information guide (BIG) and a directory of business support programs in the Pacific.\n13. The series of private sector stakeholder workshops and conferences will be launched\nduring ADB\u2019s annual meeting in May 2001 in Hawaii. A seminar on private sector development\nin PDMCs will be held with presentations on BDS, SME finance and red tape. The BIG and the\ndirectory of the business support programs will be launched during the seminar.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The TA is estimated to cost $350,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the TA on a grant\nbasis, from the ADB-funded TA program. The TA will finance about 12 national private sector\nstakeholder workshops and two regional conferences. The cost will cover international and\ndomestic consulting services; per diem and travel costs of private sector stakeholders and\nresource persons to attend the regional workshops; workshop organization and reporting; and\nthe compilation, publication, and dissemination of the BIG and the directory of business support\nprograms. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.", "4\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n15. ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The activities of the TA will cover all\nPDMCs. The preparation of the BIG and the directory of the business support programs will be\nprepared in close collaboration with the South Pacific Trade Commission. The national and\nregional  workshops  and  conferences  will  be  implemented  in  consultation  with  the  Forum\nSecretariat.\n16. The team of individual consultants will have specialization in (i) SME development and\ninstitutional analysis of BDS providers, (ii) SME finance in the context of small island states, and\n(iii) private sector regulations and analysis. Eight person-months of international and eight\nperson-months  of  domestic  consultancies  are  required.  The  consultants\u2019  outline  terms  of\nreference are in Appendix 3. The TA will be implemented during a period of about 24 months\n(January 2001-December 2002) with intermittent assignments of the international consultants to\ncommence  in  February  2001.  During  the  first  field  visits,  the  international  consultants  will\nestablish  a  detailed  list  of  tasks  to  be  undertaken  by  the  domestic  consultants,  whose\nassignments  will  be  intermittent  and  will  commence  in  March  2001.  Two  weeks  after  the\ncompletion of the last field visit, each consultant will submit (i) an interim progress report upon\ncompletion of each field visit, and (ii) a draft final report in accordance with the terms of\nreference. The expected TA completion date is December 2002. Individual consultants will be\nselected and engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.\nIV.
