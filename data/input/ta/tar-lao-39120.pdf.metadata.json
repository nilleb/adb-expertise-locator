The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) aims to achieve \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and graduate from its least-developed-country status by \n2020. The National Assembly of the Lao PDR mandated the Government to implement the \nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) in October 2003. The NGPES \nprovides a broad strategic framework from which future growth and poverty reduction programs \nwill be developed and implemented. Implementation of the NGPES will require public resources \nto be mobilized, allocated, and applied effectively in line with the Government's policy and \ndevelopment  priorities.  The  NGPES  emphasizes  the  need  for  capacity  building  for  public \nexpenditure management (PEM) at all levels of public administration.1  \n \n2.  On the Government\u2019s request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA)2  seeks to support the Lao PDR to improve its PEM.  The proposed \nTA is in line with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for the Lao PDR, which highlights \ngood governance through policy and institutional development as key to achieving sustainable \neconomic growth. A Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to Vientiane on 23\u201327 May 2005. The \nMission  and  representatives  from  the  Government  held  discussions  and  reached  an \nunderstanding on the objective, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements of the TA. The \nTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The 2002 Public Expenditure Review and Country Financial Accountability Assessment \njointly undertaken by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and ADB identified \nweaknesses in the Lao PDR\u2019s PEM systems. Although some progress has been made in recent \nyears, structural weaknesses in the PEM system remain and constitute a critical constraint on \nNGPES  implementation.  The  weaknesses  include  (i)  poor  articulation  of  expenditures  with \npolicy priorities, and of the relationship between recurrent and investment spending; (ii) weak \nexpenditure control leading to increase in arrears; (iii) delays in paying the salaries of public \nofficials; (iv) incomplete remittance of central Government revenues by local authorities; (v) \nweak compliance with procurement and payment procedures; (vi) poor reporting; and (vii) lack \nof an effective independent audit. These challenges need to be addressed over the medium\u2013\nterm and will require external funding support.  \n \n4.  Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program. The Government\u2019s PEM \nreform  strategy  up  to  end-FY2009  is  laid  out  in  its  Public  Expenditure  Management \nStrengthening Program (PEMSP), approved by the minister of finance in January 2005. The \nGovernment  reiterated  its  commitment  to  implementing  the  PEMSP  in  the  Implementation \nPolicy Framework issued in relation to the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Hydroelectric Project.3   \n \n                                                 \n1  See also National Round Table Process Steering Committee. 2004. Note on Progress Towards Implementation of \nthe NGPES. Lao PDR. In addition, a policy paper of the Government on governance issues also identified sound \nfinancial management as one of four priority areas to achieve macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth with \nequity.

The Government\u2019s commitment to implementation of all \nactivities required under the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) is also included in \nthe specific assurances given by the Government in the NT2 project, para. 83 (ix), ADB. 2005. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the Greater Mekong Subregion \nfor the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project. Manila. (Loan 2162 approved 4 April 2005).  ", "2   \n5.  The  PEMSP  is  a  5-year  program  covering  Government  initiatives  focusing  on \nstrengthening management systems and the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and \nprovincial finance departments with pilot interventions at the provincial and sector levels.4  Its \nstrategic objective is to improve policy consistency, efficiency, transparency and accountability, \nand progress toward appropriate international financial management standards.  \n \n6.  The program lays out the broad objectives for PEM reform, the intended outcomes and \nindicators to monitor improvements in system performance, and an implementation schedule. \nMoreover,  the  PEMSP  serves  as  a  framework  for  mobilizing  and  coordinating  external \nassistance.  Thus,  the  PEMSP  constitutes  a  comprehensive,  government-led  program  that \nensures consistency of the technical approach with appropriate sequencing, and is intended to \navoid duplication of external funding support.  \n \n7.  The  PEMSP  has  five  components:  (A)  fiscal  planning  and  budget  preparation;  (B) \nbudget  execution,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting;  (C)  local  government  financial \nmanagement; (D) financial legislation and regulatory framework; and (E) capacity building. In \nconsultation with the World Bank and other external funding agencies involved in the PEMSP, \nADB will support the Government in addressing weaknesses identified under component (A), \nmore specifically, in improving the quality of fiscal planning.  \n \n8.  Fiscal Planning.  Current practice in fiscal planning and budgeting does not provide a \nsound basis for aligning resources with NGPES policies. First, the budget formulation process \nlacks a coherent medium-term strategic framework. Articulation between capital and recurrent \nexpenditures and between national policies and provincial budgeting is poor. This leads to \ninadequate provision for recurrent expenditures and significant variations in the overall level of \nspending and budget allocation to priority sectors among provinces.  Second, budget allocation \nis essentially incremental and budgetary decisions are not policy- or program-driven. There is \nno effective forward planning of recurrent spending, making it difficult to accommodate phased \nadjustment in the structure of expenditures. Third, the National Assembly approves only broad \nexpenditure allocations, providing little direction for resolving fiscal constraints. There is neither \npolicy  rationale  in  the  Government's  budget  proposals  nor  policy  consistency  in  proposed \nresource allocations.  \n \n9.  Furthermore, the budget takes the form of aggregate allocations at the ministerial level \nwith exhaustive detailed line item classifications, but provides little information on the purpose of \nspending.  Finally,  the  capacity  to  undertake  effective  independent  economic  and  fiscal \nforecasting  is  weak,  with  the  tendency  to  adopt  optimistic  macroeconomic  and  revenue \nprojections. There is an acute shortage of staff with adequate formal and informal training and \nexperience in finance or accounting, particularly at the provincial and district levels. \n \n10.  The PEMSP objective for component A is to ensure that fiscal planning and budgeting \nsystems effectively allocate public resources according to the Government\u2019s development and \npoverty  reduction  policy  objectives.  Among  many  objectives,  the  PEMSP  envisions  the \n                                                 \n4  The PEMSP design builds on a substantial body of analytical work from extensive Ministry of Finance-World Bank-\nADB program preparation missions during 2004 and the joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund-ADB Public \nExpenditure Review in 2002. \n ", "    3\ndevelopment  of  a  consolidated  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)5\u2015covering \nrecurrent and capital expenditures funded by both domestic and external sources\u2015which will \nhelp the Government gradually shift resources in line with its policy goals.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The goal of the TA is to contribute to improved allocation efficiency of public resources \naccording  to  the  Government\u2019s  development  and  poverty  reduction  policy  objectives, \napproaching international good practice standards in public financial management. \n \n12.  The TA outcome would be (i) improved quality of fiscal planning, and (ii) improved \ncapacity within the relevant MOF departments and government agencies involved in the fiscal \nplanning process. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Improving  the  Quality  of  Fiscal  Planning.  The  TA  will  assess  the  present  fiscal \nplanning process and the progress thus far achieved by the Government in this area of the \nPEMSP. Challenges and opportunities will be identified and addressed in the development of a \ncoherent  MTEF.  The  MTEF  will  include  guidelines  on  revenue  estimations  and  costing  of \nexpenditures  of  key  reforms  under  the  NGPES  policies  and  programs.  The  framework  is \nenvisioned to include clear linkages between expenditure funding allocations and resource \navailability,  prioritization,  and  sequencing  of  budgetary  expenditures  (as  well  as  between \nrecurrent and capital expenditures). Mechanisms that will be put in place will allow comparison \nof  aggregate  expenditures  with  projected  revenue  to  determine  budget  resource  gaps. \nProvisions for annual reassessment of fiscal sustainability in the context of major fiscal risks will \nalso be addressed in the framework. The TA is envisioned to implement the MTEF on a pilot \nbasis at the central Government level, the specific areas (i.e., sectors or line ministries) to be \ndetermined in the course of TA implementation.6\n \n14.  Capacity Building. The TA will provide training on fiscal planning, budgetary systems, \ninternational public financial/expenditure management standards, and computer models and \ndatabase systems to the relevant MOF departments such as the Fiscal Policy Department, \nBudget Department, External Financial Relations Department, Accounting Department, and the \nCommittee  on  Planning  and  Investment  (CPI).  In  addition,  training  workshops  for  MOF\u2019s \nprovincial and local district offices will be conducted to build general awareness on standards of \ngood  practice  in  international  public  financial  management.    Computer  equipment  with \nincreased  speed  and  capacity  will  be  provided  to  assist  in  the  identified  core  areas  of \nautomation of fiscal planning and budgeting. The TA will develop and customize simple-to-use \n                                                 \n5  A medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) is a 3-year framework that focuses on policy priorities and supports \ndecisions regarding the level and allocation of resources, both government-wide and within spending agencies. \nThe MTEF consists of a top-down resource envelope consistent with macroeconomic stability and internal/external \nresource availability, and a bottom-up estimate of current and medium-term costs of existing national priorities. \nDecision makers can use the MTEF to analyze different scenarios to match aggregate expenditure with resource \navailability and assess the costs and benefits of policy options. Fozzard, A. and Foster, M. 2001. Changing \nApproaches to Public Expenditure Management in Low-Income Aid Dependent Countries.  Helsinki: World Institute \nfor Development Economics Research.   \n6  The current planning and budgeting processes are performed by functional line ministries rather than by sectors \nand/or programs.  Although the Government recognizes that there should be a gradual shift to planning and \nbudgeting on a sectoral basis, practical implementation concerns (such as staff capacity and data availability) are \nto be further considered in the final determination of areas for piloting the MTEF.  ", "4   \ncomputer spreadsheets and database management models, adapted to the Lao context and in \nthe Lao language, to facilitate the timely storage and transfer of data and comparison of actual \ndata with projected data for trends and variance analysis. \n \n15.  Close consultation with stakeholders such as the different ministries and government \nagencies, provincial governments, and relevant departments within MOF will be held through \nparticipatory workshops to build consensus and Government ownership of the outputs of the \nTA.  There  will  also  be  close  coordination  during  TA  implementation  with  external  funding \nagencies involved in the PEMSP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $825,000 equivalent, comprising $480,000 in \nforeign exchange and $345,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $700,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $220,000 \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nCooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty \nReduction Strategies. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent to $125,000 through the provision of counterpart staff, office space and utilities, \nadministrative  services,  and  physical  facilities.  Appendix  2  gives  the  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Department of Fiscal Policy of MOF will be the Executing Agency. Implementing \nagencies will include the Budget Department, the External Financial Relations Department, the \nAccounting  Department  of  MOF,  and  the  CPI.  The  TA  will  use  the  existing  coordination \nmechanisms of the PEMSP to facilitate review of TA implementation progress in the overall \ncontext of the PEMSP.7  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from October 2005 to September 2007 (i.e., \ncoinciding  with  the  Government\u2019s  FY2005  and  FY2006),  and  will  require  a  team  of  two \ninternational  (14  person\u2013months)  and  two  domestic  consultants  (44  person\u2013months).  An \ninternational fiscal planning specialist (team leader) and an international budget management \nspecialist will be recruited for 8 and 6 person\u2013months respectively, to work intermittently over \nthe TA period. A domestic fiscal management specialist and a domestic software development \nspecialist  will  be  recruited  to  work  intermittently  for  22  person\u2013months  each,  over  the  TA \nimplementation period. The consultant team will produce various reports as outlined in their \nterms of reference, each of which will be discussed in tripartite meetings. The consultants will be \nengaged  through  a  firm  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  process,  and  the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance \n                                                 \n7  The PEMSP implementation arrangements include (i) a PEMSP Program Steering Committee, chaired by the vice \nminister of finance, with representatives of the relevant MOF departments, which reviews progress and approves \nMOF departments\u2019  work  programs to  implement PEMSP components; (ii) a PEMSP Program  Coordination \nCommittee, chaired by the minister of finance, with participation of contributing partners; and (iii) a program \ncoordinator  to  support  both  committees,  consolidate  work  plans  and  progress  reports,  and  deal  with  the \nadministration of the PEMSP. The PEMSP Program Coordination Committee is envisioned to meet twice a year to \nreview and update the PEMSP in line with progress in program implementation and the Government\u2019s policy \ndirectives and programmed external funding support. Monitoring reports will also be produced on a semiannual \nbasis to coincide with the above meetings. The design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 reflects the \nsequencing and timing of activities, and performance indicators of the broader PEMSP implementation schedule \ncommitted by the Government (see also refer to footnote 3). \n ", "    5\nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. Various training seminars and workshops at the central, provincial, and district \noffices will be held to encourage participatory discussion of the improvement of the fiscal \nplanning processes and increasing the capacity of all staff levels within the relevant government \nagencies. There will also be close coordination during TA implementation with external funding \nagencies  involved  in  the  PEMSP.  The  final  report  of  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  to  all \nstakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation \nFund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategies  for  Public  Expenditure  Planning  for  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
