INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Institute was established in \n2006 as the knowledge institution of and for the CAREC program.1 CAREC 2020, which lays out \nthe strategic vision and operational directions for the CAREC program, identifies the CAREC \nInstitute as one of its seven operational priorities, and calls on the institute to provide the \nrequired analytical work and strengthen stakeholder capacities to support the achievement of \nCAREC\u2017s  strategic  goals  of  expanding  trade  and  improving  competitiveness.2 Further,  the \nstrategic knowledge framework (SKF), 2013\u20132017 for the institute was endorsed by the senior \nofficials\u2018 meeting held in June 2012. The SKF has three components: knowledge generation \n(research), knowledge services (capacity building), and knowledge management. The objective \nis to build the CAREC Institute into a leading knowledge institution on economic cooperation in \nthe region. In particular, the institute will (i) sharpen its focus on regional, multisector, and \ncommon sector issues pertinent to CAREC; (ii) integrate knowledge generation, services, and \nmanagement for effectiveness; and (iii) form strategic alliances with regional institutions and \nnetworks.3  \n \n2.  Since  the  institute\u2018s  founding,  ADB  has  provided  secretariat  support  and  technical \nassistance (TA).4 After the adoption of CAREC 2020 in November 2011, consultation with \nCAREC countries on ways forward for the institute and concrete measures to implement the \nSKF has been held, including the senior officials\u2018 meeting held in June 2012 and a special \nnational focal point meeting held in September 2012. On these occasions, the CAREC countries \nendorsed ADB\u2018s TA support for the CAREC Institute for knowledge generation, services, and \nmanagement, to be built on  past TA support. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The CAREC program is a key mechanism for economic cooperation in the CAREC \nregion. Since 2001, significant progress has been achieved, especially in the priority areas of \ntransport and trade facilitation, energy, and trade policy, as evidenced by a properly functioning \ninstitutional framework for policy dialogue and decision making, as well as investments totaling \nover $19 billion to date. However, much remains to be done.  \n \n4.  A key challenge facing the CAREC countries is to transform transport corridors into \neconomic corridors. As rehabilitating six key CAREC transport corridors has progressed rapidly, \nthe issue of how to use these roads and railways to maximum effect in terms of economic and \nsocial  development  is  gaining  urgency.  This  is  an  issue  which  transcends  single  sector \ncapability and responsibility, and the width and depth of the issue are also beyond the purview \n                                                \n1  Founded in 2001, CAREC is a partnership of 10 countries for regional economic cooperation\u2014Afghanistan, \nAzerbaijan, the People\u2018s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan\u2014and six multilateral institutions: the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, United \nNations Development Programme, and the World Bank. ADB has served as the CAREC secretariat since 2001.  \n2  ADB. 2012. CAREC 2020: A Strategic Framework for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, \n2011\u20132020. Manila. \n3  ADB\u2018s Vice-President for Operations 1 provided concept clearance for the technical assistance (TA) on 12 \nSeptember 2012. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2018s website on 7 September \n2012.  \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Capacity Development for Regional Cooperation in CAREC Participating \nCountries, Phase I. Manila (TA 6375-REG; $990,000); ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Institute, 2009\u20132012. Manila (TA 6488-REG; $5,000,000). \n ", "2   \nof a single country. Similarly, no mechanism exists to date within the CAREC program for \ncoping with this new challenge. Thus, better understanding of an economic corridor needs to be \ndeveloped with respect to effective approaches, key issues, and appropriate policy measures \nand required investments.    \n \n5.  To  improve  the  competitiveness  of  CAREC  countries,  further  progress  is  needed \ntowards  free  movement  of  goods  and  people  across  borders.  While  past  assistance  and \ncooperation  in  CAREC  has  tended  to  be  single-sector  based  (e.g.,  customs  cooperation), \nfurther  progress  in  cross-border  trade  facilitation  will  require  multisector  coordination  and \ncooperation, both within a country and between neighboring countries. Within a country, future \npolicy measures will likely involve multiple sectors and overarching policies, both at the border \nand behind the border. Among bordering countries, coordination in implementing effective policy \nmeasures will become critical. These \u2015second-generation\u2016 cooperation measures will require \nnew insight, new knowledge, solutions, and new policy tools and measures, supported by \nappropriate mechanisms to facilitate the achievement of concrete progress on the ground.  \n \n6.  The CAREC countries are strategically located across Eurasia, and events in the region \ncould have significant impact on these countries. For example, the formation and development \nof the common economic space, which would integrate not only product markets but also capital \nand labor markets in several countries including some CAREC countries, would have a regional \nimpact. Such region-wide issues would need to be studied for the benefit of CAREC member \ncountries.  \n \n7.  New challenges are also emerging in the traditional CAREC priority areas of transport, \nenergy, trade policy, and trade facilitation. For example, while rebuilding the roads and railways \nalong six CAREC transport corridors remains a key task, identifying and implementing cost-\neffective  ways  of  maintaining  those  roads  already  rehabilitated  is  becoming  urgent.  With \nphysical connectivity improved, road safety is becoming increasingly an issue as it directly \nimpacts on people\u2018s lives and livelihood. Similarly, sector issues such as energy efficiency that \nare common across several CAREC countries are gaining importance.    \n \n8.  Further mainstreaming CAREC  into the  national  development  agenda  and fostering \nstronger country ownership is fundamental, as further progress in economic cooperation in the \nregion can only be achieved if the concepts, principles, and benefits of regional cooperation are \ninternalized into the decision-making process of the individual CAREC countries. Thus, the \nprovision of quality knowledge products and services which provide the analytical underpinnings \nof regional cooperation processes, their costs and benefits, and the best ways to implement \nthem is critical to informed decision making on policy choices. It would also promote better \nunderstanding of the key challenges and evolving trends affecting the countries of the region, \nthus helping decision makers anticipate and craft appropriate responses. \n \n9.  As a knowledge institution, the CAREC Institute is mandated to address key regional, \nmultisector, and common sector issues through its research and related activities. At the same \ntime,  its  institutional  capacity  will  need  to  be  significantly  strengthened.  Key  issues  being \ndeliberated by the countries for implementation include (i) establishing core staff; (ii) measures \nto strengthen the institute\u2018s governance structure, including academic advisory governance; \n(iii) reaching out to and establishing alliances with regional and nonregional stakeholders; and \n(iv) setting up an appropriate and effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism.  \n \n10.  Lessons. Key lessons include quality issues associated with past research conducted \nby the institute, and the absence of research output dissemination, as discussed below.  \n ", "  3 \n \n11.  Lack of focus. The past research agenda may have been significant in itself, but some \nlacked direct relevance to the CAREC program. The SKF endorsed in June 2012 emphasizes \nthat the institute should focus on regional, multisector, and common sector issues pertinent to \nthe CAREC program; this will result in the CAREC Institute becoming more focused. \n \n12.  Lack of knowledge management. Past ADB support focused on research and capacity \nbuilding. Except for a website, no effort was made to meet the need for knowledge management \nin the CAREC program. The use of e-technology to package and process existing knowledge \ninto products and services is one focus area of the TA. \n \n13.  Lack of networking. Similarly, little has resulted from past ADB support in terms of \nnetworking. In striving to become a knowledge bank, ADB has launched knowledge-related \nactivities. In addition, institutions both within and outside the CAREC region have accumulated \nsignificant knowledge, experience, and lessons regarding policies and practices on economic \ncooperation. Forming networks and other alliances and exploring complementarities across \ninstitutions will be key tasks under the TA.  \n \n14.  Lack of monitoring and evaluation. Going hand-in-hand with the above-mentioned \nshortcomings is the lack of effective monitoring and evaluation to provide early warnings and \nnecessitate corrective measures. To be results-based, the CAREC Institute will treat effective \nmonitoring and evaluation as a priority.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact will be the enhanced quality of regional cooperation in the context of CAREC \n2020.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  capacity  of  governments  and  other  stakeholders  in \nCAREC  countries  to  engage  in  regional  cooperation,  as  reflected  in  their  deepened \nunderstanding and improved skills; expertise; and capacity to plan, implement, and mainstream \nregional cooperation at the national and regional levels. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will have four outputs. In implementing the outputs, the integrated approach \nemphasized in the SKF will be followed to achieve synergy among different lines of knowledge \nwork and gain effectiveness.  \n \n17.  Output 1: New knowledge. The CAREC Institute will plan, organize, and manage the \nconduct of research. First and foremost, a medium-term research agenda will be developed in \nline with the mandates given by CAREC 2020 and the SKF. Key areas of research may include \n(i)  policy  measures  and  investment  needs  for  specific  CAREC  corridors  which  would  be \nessential  in  transforming  a  transport  corridor  into  an  economic  corridor,  and  (ii)  further \nimprovement  of  cross-border  trade  focusing  on  second-generation  policy  and  institutional \nmeasures and investment. Appropriate institutional mechanisms will be explored under both \nareas.  \n \n18.  In conducting research, the institute will seek strategic alliances and association with \nregional and nonregional academic and research institutions and individuals, similar institutions \nof multilateral institution partners, as well as knowledge initiatives and programs within ADB, \n ", "4   \nincluding the Asian Development Bank Institute. This approach will strengthen the CAREC \nInstitute, benefit partner institutions, and facilitate the generation of new knowledge and the \nexchange of experiences and lessons in regional economic cooperation in Central Asia.  \n \n19.  Output 2: Center of knowledge and information sources on regional cooperation. \nThe CAREC Institute will provide the mechanisms by which knowledge about CAREC from \nmultiple  sources  is  organized  in  a  user-friendly  way  that  facilitates  decision  making  and \nadvances practical research activities. This will involve compiling and organizing existing data, \ninformation, and knowledge; transforming the data into knowledge products; and providing the \nmeans  for  easy  access  to  these  knowledge  products  by  policy  makers,  development \npractitioners,  academics  and  researchers,  and  civil  society.  The  institute  will  disseminate \nknowledge through appropriate means (e.g., CAREC website, conferences, workshops, and \npublications). The institute will also develop, maintain, and publish a database of research-\noriented institutions in the CAREC countries, with information on their affiliation, ownership, \nactivities, areas of expertise, publications, and other relevant information. This database will \nfacilitate regional exchange and knowledge sharing among CAREC countries. \n \n20.  Output 3: Platform for the exchange and dissemination of knowledge. Up-to-date, \neffective, and easily accessible means of disseminating knowledge and exchanging ideas and \nexperiences could have significant impact on public awareness, academic research, and policy \nthinking on regional economic cooperation, through which new knowledge can germinate. The \nCAREC Institute in its next phase will pay particular attention to this area. The CAREC Institute \nwill provide a platform for stakeholders to discuss and debate CAREC issues through seminars, \nconferences,  policy  dialogues,  and  roundtable  discussions.  Distinguished  speakers  and \nresource persons will be invited to these events. Networks of practitioners in transport and trade \nfacilitation, energy, trade policy, and other sectors will be developed to promote knowledge \nexchange and collaboration between professionals and experts in CAREC countries. In addition, \nthe institute will set up knowledge platforms to achieve accelerated connectivity in information \nand knowledge. Through electronic media, such platforms leverage the internet to share, create, \nand utilize knowledge among individuals, groups, and organizations. \n \n21.  Output 4: Strengthening institutional capacity. As the CAREC Institute strives to \nbecome a leading knowledge institution, considerable institutional strengthening will be needed. \nThis will include establishing the institutional and academic governance structure, management, \ncore staff, and advisory body. These are among the top issues for the countries to discuss, \nagree  upon,  and  prepare  to  establish.  In  addition,  an  effective  system for monitoring  and \nevaluation will need to be formulated and made operational, while taking into consideration the \nnature of the CAREC Institute as a knowledge institution. In the process, the institute will reach \nout to other knowledge-based initiatives both within and outside ADB for experience exchange \nand lessons.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million equivalent, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2018s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Appendix 2 provides the details.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The TA will be implemented from December 2012 to December 2014. ADB will be the \nexecuting  agency,  with  the  Central  and  West  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination  Division  as  the  focal  point  for  TA  administration,  including  coordinating  the \n ", "  5 \nrecruitment and supervision of consultants. Guidance on the CAREC Institute work program will \nbe  received  from,  and  regular  reporting  will  be  made  to,  the  existing  CAREC  institutional \nmechanism, which consists of sector coordination committees and senior officials\u2018 meetings and \nministerial conferences. Coordination with the TA on capacity building of the CAREC Institute \nwill be ensured.5  \n \n24.  Implementing the TA will require 28 person-months of international consulting inputs \nfrom a research director and an institutional capacity building specialist, and 72 person-months \nof national consulting inputs from a research officer, a database and website analyst, and \nprogram  coordinator.  The  consultants\u2018  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nconsultants will be engaged individually because of multiple skills required, in accordance with \nADB\u2018s  Guidelines  on the  Use  of  Consultants (2010,  as  amended from  time to  time).  The \nconsultants will be based in ADB headquarters. ADB staff will manage TA implementation with a \nsenior staff member leading these efforts. Some office and telecommunications equipment may \nbe procured pursuant to ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand in coordination with the Office of Administrative Services and the Office of Information \nSystems and Technology.  \n \n25.  Workshops,  conferences,  or  seminars  will  be  held  during  TA  implementation. \nProcurement of goods and other services under the TA will be made in accordance with the \nProcurement Guidelines. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2018s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n26.  Reports of TA outputs will be regularly submitted to the CAREC senior officials\u2018 meeting \nand ministerial conference, and posted on the CAREC website (www.carecprogram.org) and/or \nnew website(s) created under the TA. The monitoring and evaluation system to be established \nunder the TA will facilitate measurement of the TA outcome, and will be reported to the CAREC \nministerial conference and disseminated widely on CAREC-related websites.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Assisting the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute Knowledge Program \n(Phase 1), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n5 ADB.
