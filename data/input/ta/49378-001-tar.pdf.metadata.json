INTRODUCTION \n1.  Between 2014 and 2050, the number of urban residents in South Asia is expected to \nnearly double from 472.8 million to 947.8 million.1 In the face of this unprecedented growth, \ncities throughout the region have been unable to keep pace with the growing demands of urban \npopulations, significantly lagging in the delivery of basic services (water supply, sanitation, \nstormwater drainage, and urban transport). A key reason is that the region\u2019s urban infrastructure \necosystem of stakeholders\u2014comprising local, state, and central governments, private sector \n(consultants and contractors), and academic institutions\u2014is constrained by weak capacities and \npoor coordination in the planning, design, and implementation of projects. Exposure to various \ninnovations and good practices in the sector is limited, resulting in the continuation of business-\nas-usual approaches. This curbs improvements toward effective infrastructure development and \nservice delivery, including effective response to the risks associated with the changing climate. \nThe result is persistently slow progress in achieving key development indicators and enhancing \nurban livability throughout the region. \n \n2.  Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasizes the need for capacity \nbuilding  and  institutional  strengthening  to  achieve  inclusive  and  sustainable  urban  service \ndelivery in the region.2 ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020 similarly highlights the need \nto strengthen local capacity on existing systems to undertake integrated urban development, \noperationalized  both  through  projects  and  the  establishment  of  networks  for  peer-to-peer \nlearning and sharing of best practices among cities.3 In addition, ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategies for Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka highlight the need for institutional \nstrengthening and capacity development to ensure efficient and effective project design and \ndelivery. This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) 4 aims to improve the \ncapacities of key urban sector stakeholders and the coordination between them to develop and \nimplement smart urban infrastructure5 that can respond simultaneously to the challenges of \neconomic  growth,  environmental  sustainability,  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation, \npreparedness for disaster risk,6 and inclusiveness. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  To meet the large urban infrastructure deficits, governments in South Asia are looking to \nscale up investments and proactively manage urbanization to enhance urban livability and boost \neconomic growth. However, the massive investments expected to flow into urban infrastructure \ndevelopment  will  encounter  serious  systemic  weaknesses  in  the  capacity  of  institutions \nresponsible for the delivery of urban infrastructure. The need to overcome capacity bottlenecks \nand improve the interaction between stakeholders is urgent. \n \n4.  The performance of ADB\u2019s urban sector assistance in South Asia needs to improve \nacross the whole project cycle: planning, design, procurement, implementation, and operation \n                                                \n1  United Nations. 2014.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 December 2015. \n5  Smart urban infrastructure effectively integrates physical, digital, and human systems in the built environment to \ndeliver a sustainable, prosperous, and inclusive future for its citizens. \n6  Geographical hazards such as earthquakes pose a high risk to many of the region\u2019s cities in general. \n ", "2 \nand maintenance.7 Further, the fragmentation of stakeholders prevents relationships conducive \nto stronger sector performance. Strong links between these stakeholders are essential to solve \nthe systemic problems. The urban infrastructure ecosystem is also in critical need of institutional \nand technological partnerships with frontier urban infrastructure entities from both within and \noutside the region to enable the transfer of innovative ideas, practices, and technologies for the \ndevelopment of smart urban infrastructure. \n \n5.  Hence,  it  is  important  to  strengthen  the  capacity  and  coordination  of  the  main \nstakeholders to enable the delivery of smart infrastructure and services in the region\u2019s cities. \nThe TA will provide capacity building support to the urban sector in the participating developing \nmember countries (DMCs)8 for the design and implementation of smart urban infrastructure \nprojects. This involves (i) the provision of incremental consulting services to enhance project \npreparatory and project implementation capacity, and to assess the institutional setups for \nmanaging, operating, and regulating the delivery of urban services; and (ii) the delivery of \nproject-related training aimed at enhancing the capacity of urban sector stakeholders to envision, \ndesign,  and  implement  smart  urban  infrastructure  projects.  The  TA  also  aims  to  catalyze \nsynergistic  partnerships  and  collaborations  between  the  major  urban  stakeholders,  which \ntraditionally have operated in silos\u2014e.g., pre- and in-service training of recent graduate and \ndiploma-holding  civil  engineers  through  trainee  placements  in  ongoing  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects,9 and providing recommendations for revamping engineering curricula to \nimprove capacities in project design, preparation, and management. In addition, the avenues \nprovided for learning and for sharing relevant best practices from within and outside the region \n(para.  11)  are  expected  to  catalyze  new  as  well  as  strengthened  partnerships  between \nstakeholders for the delivery of smart urban infrastructure. \n \n6.  Stronger interaction between stakeholders coupled with dedicated capacity building in \nthe areas of project design and implementation will be a crucial first step toward unlocking \nsynergies for developing smart urban infrastructure and providing sustainable services. The TA \nwill enable the application of best practices in ADB-funded projects (possibly as pilots and \ndemonstration cases), support poorly performing projects through the provision of technical \nsupport and partnership arrangements,10 and enable the creation of innovative stakeholder \ncollaboration through its strong networking and knowledge-sharing focus. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be that sustainable smart urban infrastructure and services are delivered \nin South Asian cities, aligned with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan. The outcome will be that the \ninstitutional capacity and knowledge base of urban service providers and stakeholders in the \ndesign and implementation of smart urban infrastructure projects is improved. \n                                                \n7  ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department has rated only three-quarters of the urban sector projects of ADB\u2019s \nSouth Asia Department between 2007 and 2014 successful. Its forthcoming studies highlight several problems in \nproject design and implementation, and point to the need for better design and stronger sustainability measures to \nimprove development effectiveness in urban sector projects throughout the Asia and Pacific region. \n8  The anticipated participating DMCs include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n9  Most urban infrastructure development is in the public domain, being implemented or operated by municipalities or \nstate- or city-level enterprises. \n10 Includes supporting at least one poorly performing smart infrastructure project through a twinning arrangement with \na successful project of a similar nature (para. 10 and Appendix 1). \n ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) design and implementation capacity of the main urban \nsector stakeholders11 for the provision of smart urban infrastructure and services enhanced, \n(ii) strategic partnerships for smart urban infrastructure development established, and (iii) good \npractices in the design and delivery of smart urban infrastructure and services shared. \n \n9.  Cities and projects shall be selected during the TA implementation based on demand \nand nominations to be provided by the DMCs in consultation with ADB operations staff. If \nnominations exceed the limit of support that can be provided through the TA, then the cities will \nbe prioritized as follows: (i) those that already have development plans identifying the nature of \ninvestments required, (ii) those that are at an early stage of project design preparations, and \n(iii) those with urban projects emphasizing a pro-poor approach. Support through consultant \ninputs shall be provided to the selected cities for designing at least three innovative smart urban \ninfrastructure projects that meet the required project-readiness criteria.12 This is expected to \nhelp create a pipeline of investment-ready projects in the urban sector in the selected South \nAsian cities. The TA will support at least one poorly performing, ADB-funded smart urban \ninfrastructure project per participating country to help tackle bottlenecks and implementation \nchallenges through the provision of suitable consulting inputs and training programs. Training \nshall be provided to at least 150 urban sector stakeholders in the region (at least 50 per \nparticipating  country)  in  the  areas  of  design  and  implementation  quality  control,  project \ncommunications,  project  management,  and  procurement  support  for  the  development  and \nimplementation of smart urban infrastructure projects. 13 \n \n10.  In terms of establishing partnerships around infrastructure projects, the TA shall support \nat least one poorly performing smart urban infrastructure project through a suitable twinning \narrangement with a successful smart urban infrastructure project to enable knowledge transfer \nof  successful  project  implementation  approaches.  To  establish  and  eventually  strengthen \npartnerships with technical education institutions, the TA will support the placement of recent \ngraduates and diploma holders in project-related agencies. Recommendations shall also be \nprovided for the revision of technical educational curricula to make them more relevant to the \nneeds of the market and/or industry by undertaking a thorough analysis of current deficiencies \nin the curricula to produce market-ready professionals.  \n \n11.  The  regional  and  national  knowledge-sharing  and  networking  events  will  catalyze \nsynergistic  collaboration  between  stakeholders by  (i)  providing  a  platform for  urban  sector \nregional stakeholders to meet, brainstorm, and network; (ii) providing an arena to enable the \nsharing  of  project  design  and  implementation  experiences  (including  difficulties)  within  the \nregion; and (iii) disseminating knowledge on successful, replicable international and regional \nbest practices, which will allow participants to discuss methods for employing these in new \nprojects. Best practices shared during these events shall take into account, and be tailored to, \nthe needs of the various levels of development, size of market, and geographic peculiarities of \nthe participating cities. This implies that best-practice examples need to be diverse\u2014e.g., from \nadvanced to \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d models, from small- to medium-sized cities\u2014for methods to be \nof use to the urban development needs of the selected cities. Resource persons shall be utilized \n                                                \n11 They include government agencies, consultants, contractors, and academic institutions in the selected cities of the \nparticipating DMCs. \n12 ADB and government criteria regarding social and environmental safeguards, and other due diligence aspects. \nThese projects will be geographically distributed among participating countries. \n13 During TA implementation, these training sessions will be closely coordinated with relevant departments for both \ncontent development and timing of their delivery to mitigate any potential overlaps. \n ", "4 \nduring these events to provide participants with exposure to global innovative smart urban \nproject design and implementation methods as well as the application of new technologies in \nurban sector projects. One flagship knowledge product documenting innovative smart urban \ndevelopment approaches in the region shall also be prepared under the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The governments will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, training venues, \noffice supplies, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions such as taxes and duties, \nif any. The value of the governments\u2019 contribution is estimated to account for 10% of the total \nTA cost. The TA activities in each participating country will start upon receipt of the respective \ngovernment\u2019s  confirmation  of  participation.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency; the Urban Development and Water Division (SAUW) \nof its South Asia Department will be the principal administrator of the TA. SAUW shall be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  management  and  coordination  of  the  TA,  i.e.,  implementation \noversight,  accountability  for  TA  outputs,  recruitment  and  management  of  consultants, \nsupervision  of  knowledge-transfer  activities,  and  reporting  and  communicating  with  the \nstakeholders. The TA will be implemented over 36 months from January 2016 to December \n2018.  SAUW,  in  close  coordination  with  the  Urban  Sector  Group  of  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department and resident missions, will work in cooperation \nwith  national  governments,  local  governments,  project  management  units,  knowledge \ninstitutions,  and  other  urban  sector  stakeholders  in  the  targeted  countries  and  cities. \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).14 \n \n14.  The TA requires 30 person-months of individual consulting input in the fields of urban \ninfrastructure (water supply, wastewater management, solid waste management, and storm \nwater  management),  project  management,  social  development,  environment,  procurement, \neconomics, financial analysis, communications, coordination, and capacity building and urban \ninstitutions.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  and  deployed  based  on  the  DMCs\u2019  needs  and \nspecialist requirements identified in each participating city or for each project.15 Consultants will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time).16 Consultants will work under the overall supervision of ADB. \nTheir outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.
