INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) was established in 2001 to encourage closer ties among \nAsian countries through regional cooperation and integration (RCI) and to bring Asian countries \ncloser to their development goals. It serves as a platform for dialogue and provides a high-level \nforum for government officials, business leaders, and academics to discuss policy issues and \ncurrent regional concerns. The BFA, the first and largest forum in Asia to date and likened to the \nWorld Economic Forum, is considered a valued partner in facilitating RCI in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the BFA in conducting regional \npolicy  dialogues  and  disseminating  knowledge  products  on  RCI  to  developing  countries. \nGovernment leaders, corporate executives, scholars, experts, representatives of international \nand  nongovernment  organizations,  and  journalists  gather  at  annual  BFA  conferences  for \ndiscussions and debates on key current issues. ADB has closely collaborated with the BFA \nsince its first annual conference through its sponsorship of selected sessions, provision of \nspeakers  on  thematic  topics,  and  preparation  of  annual  reports  that  are  launched  and \ndistributed at the annual conferences. These modalities of collaboration with the BFA solidly \naffirm ADB\u2019s commitment to promoting RCI. In 2006, this collaboration was strengthened with \nthe signing of a memorandum of understanding that laid down areas of collaboration. As a \nknowledge provider, ADB prepared the 2006 and 2008 annual reports, as well as funded and \nguided the preparation of the 2009 annual report. These reports analyzed the progress of RCI \nand other development issues affecting Asia and the Pacific. \n \n3.  Several Asian export\u2013import banks (AEBs) and export credit agencies (ECAs) were \nestablished in the course of the economic development of many Asian countries in line with their \ngovernments' export-oriented strategy. Over the years, these AEBs and ECAs have evolved \ninto widely differing financial institutions reflecting different business environments, foreign trade \nprofiles, country risk considerations, and the development tracks of local financial markets. To \nenhance cooperation and forge stronger links among these institutions, a first meeting was held \nin 1996 in India, at the initiative of the Export\u2013Import Bank of India, which led to the formation of \nthe Asian Exim Banks Forum (AEBF). The participants initially included AEBs from Australia, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. \nSubsequently, Indonesia and the Philippines joined the AEBF, followed by Cambodia and Viet \nNam with observer status. \n \n4.  ADB first became involved when, at the request of the Philippines Exim Bank, ADB \nhosted the Ninth AEBF Annual Meeting at ADB headquarters in November 2003. Since then, \nADB has been invited as a permanent observer at AEBF annual meetings and at its technical \nworking group and training committee meetings. ADB's role is to design and organize AEBF \nconferences, seminars, and workshops, as well as to provide technical advice and resource \npersons. In this role, ADB has provided financial support for the training participation of selected \nAEB and ECA staff and sponsored ADB and external experts as resource persons on specific \nareas (e.g., clean energy, corporate governance, risk management, and credit enhancements). \n \n5.  Since  2002, four  small-scale  technical  assistance (TA)  programs1 and one  regional \ntechnical  assistance  program2 have  been  provided.  The  proposed  joint  Office  of  Regional \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2002. ADB Participation in the Boao Forum for Asia.

", " \n2 \n \nEconomic Integration (OREI) and Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) TA will help the BFA \ncontinue to carry out its programs in support of RCI in Asia and the Pacific in 2011 and 2012, as \nwell as train and build the capacity of AEBF members and observers for the training curriculums \nfrom July to June, 2010\u20132011 and 2011-2012. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  Although Asian regionalism has advanced rapidly, especially in the aftermath of the \nglobal financial and economic crisis, the creation of a regional community is a work in progress. \nAsia\u2019s formal regional institutions remain relatively underdeveloped. A survey of Asian opinion \nleaders  found  the  general  perception  that  Asia\u2019s  existing  regional  institutions  should  be \nsupported  to  meet  the  new  challenges  of  regional  integration.4 In  addition,  there  is  still \nsignificant disparity in the degree of integration across subregions in Asia. While Southeast and \nEast Asia seemed to have advanced the most,5 new initiatives in Central and West Asia are \nshowing some very positive results. South Asia has traditionally faced a more challenging \nenvironment for promoting RCI, but it now seems better poised to gain momentum.  \n \n7.  A number of community-building initiatives have begun. The region now has growing \ncross-border trade, increasing investments, expanding production networks, improving financial \nflows,  and  greater  movement  of  people.  A  complex  system  of  regional  and  subregional \ninstitutions has developed in response to Asia\u2019s various needs. Asia is now at the stage where it \nis determined to build a regional community and institutional structure.  \n \n8.  The BFA is well positioned to assist in deepening Asian regionalism. In this context, \nADB's support for the BFA is important for two reasons. First, the BFA provides an Asia-wide \nforum for policy coordination, knowledge exchange, agenda-setting, and consensus-building. \nSecond, the BFA has great potential to link various subregional groupings in Asia. Among \nnetwork and institution-based regional groupings, the BFA, which at present includes countries \nin Central, Northeast, Southeast, and South Asia, offers opportunities for wider exchange and \nvaluable networking. With wide membership coverage and areas of cooperation, the BFA is well \nplaced  to  facilitate  pan-Asian  policy  coordination.  BFA  members  can  work  together  to \norchestrate policies, particularly on cross-border and connectivity issues and regional public \ngoods. \n \n9.  By supporting BFA conferences, ADB helps facilitate the informal exchange of ideas and \nexpand a cooperative network for discussing RCI. The BFA is particularly important at this time \nin view of the evolving changes in global financial systems and financial architecture. Varied \nperspectives  on  current  issues  such  as  balancing  sources  of  growth,  financial  innovation, \nclimate change, and regional public goods can be discussed to help countries collectively \naddress them. Increased dialogue can bring more opportunities for cooperation in the cross-\nborder movement of goods, services, people, and information. There is potential for the BFA \nand ADB to further expand collaboration in knowledge exchange. The BFA can be a good \nvenue for ADB to showcase and raise the profile of the various subregional initiatives that ADB \n                                                                                                                                                       \n2 ADB. 2008.

Synopsis of the Study on Institutions for Regionalism Toward an Asian Economic Community. Manila. \n5 Recent efforts to institutionalize cooperation among Asian countries, especially Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+3 countries, have been successful with the formulation of the ASEAN Charter and \nthe  ASEAN  Economic  Community  Blueprint,  the  multilateralization  of  the  Chiang  Mai  Initiative,  and  the \nestablishment of a credit guarantee and investment mechanism. ", "  3 \nsupports. In the next stage of collaboration, ADB will provide suggestions and inputs to the BFA \nSecretariat on themes and topics pertinent to existing subregional initiatives for the BFA annual \nconferences. \n \n10.  Since 2005, ADB has expanded the scope of collaboration with the BFA in strengthening \nthe  knowledge  and  institutional  capacity  of  members  and  observers  of  the  AEBF.  This \nexpanded scope of collaboration grew with recognition of the importance of the AEBF to BFA \nmember countries toward facilitating economic growth in Asia. ADB organized and sponsored \nconferences, workshops, and seminars on export finance and guarantees such as on corporate \ngovernance, risk management and mitigation, clean energy financing, project and trade finance, \nthe impact of and response to the global financial crisis, environment-related operations and \nproject analysis, the legal and regulatory framework of AEBF members and observers, and the \ndesign of a risk-sharing arrangement among AEBs. In addition, ADB has often been requested \nto deliver presentations during AEBF annual meetings on topics such as Strategy 2020,6 ADB\u2019s \nresponse to the global financial crisis, and annual updates on the Asian Development Outlook. \n \n11.  The most important result of ADB\u2019s training support to AEBF members and observers \nthus far has been the increased exposure of staff of regional AEBs and ECAs to the latest \ndevelopments  and  ideas  regarding many  areas  that  are  high  on  ADB\u2019s  own  development \nagenda, such as corporate governance, clean energy financing, and sound risk management \nand mitigation. At the end of each training session, ADB has impressed on participants that they \nshould disseminate the major learning points and takeaways, as well as course materials, within \ntheir institutions to ensure that they are internalized and help AEBs and ECAs to harmonize the \nway they conduct their operations in accordance with best market practice. Such harmonization \nwould make risk-sharing arrangements easier and efficient. In addition, ADB has encouraged \nrelatively new AEBs and ECAs to seek guidance and bilateral training from their more seasoned \nand experienced peers. Overall, through its continuing training support, ADB has been able to \nwitness notable progress in the development of the relatively new members and observers \ntoward the more advanced standards employed by the front-running AEBs and ECAs.     \n \n12.  Given the need to further enhance the capacity of AEBF members, and of observers in \nparticular, in light of the envisaged geographical expansion of the AEBF membership, the TA \nwill continue to support AEBF training programs, including programs that will deal with the \nchallenges of the newly emerging global financial system. The TA will strengthen regional policy \ndialogue and build public\u2013private partnerships to enable AEBs and ECAs in the region to \nmaximize RCI opportunities and respond adequately to related challenges. A recent concrete \nresult was the approval of standardized re-guarantee and co-guarantee template wording, as \nwell as the AEBF membership protocol during the Sixteenth Annual Meeting in Busan, Republic \nof Korea, in September 2010. This will allow member AEBs and ECAs to share risks among \nthemselves, thereby strengthening their capability to take on larger projects on the basis of the \nmulti-country sourcing of goods and services and to enhance their portfolio risk management \npractices. The membership protocol further envisages the geographic expansion of the AEBF, \nsetting out observer and member eligibility criteria and procedures.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2008.

The TA is consistent with ADB's RCI strategy to build stronger partnerships with regional \ninstitutions that support RCI activities in Asia and the Pacific. It is also consistent with RCI Pillar \n3 of facilitating monetary and financial integration through capacity building.7 The TA will support \nactivities of the BFA by conducting dialogues on RCI, networking, and information exchange \namong BFA member countries. \n \n14.  ADB involvement in AEBF training programs will continue in 2010\u20132012. Training topics \nto be supported will be identified and decided upon, in consultation with ADB, at annual AEBF \ntraining  committee  meetings.  ADB  will  choose  to  support  topics  that  rank  high  on  its \ndevelopment agenda while, at the same time, catering to the specific needs of AEBF members \nand observers based on new market developments.8 The proposed TA will help expand the \nAEBF\u2019s  regional  scope  by  admitting  new  members  and  observers  from  ADB  developing \nmember countries, thereby transforming the AEBF into a truly pan-Asian forum.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The TA is expected to strengthen dialogue among BFA members and enhance AEB \nstaff capacity on RCI-related issues. The TA aims to achieve (i) increased awareness of RCI-\nrelated issues, (ii) effective risk-sharing through re-guarantee and co-guarantee cooperation \namong AEBs, and (iii) the regional expansion of the AEBF to ensure the inclusion of ADB \ndeveloping member countries that are currently left out. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  Outputs of the TA include (1) policy dialogue and information dissemination, (ii) annual \nreports on RCI-developments and related issues, and (iii) the design and delivery of client-\noriented, high-quality AEBF training programs. \n \n17.  The TA will support two BFA annual conferences. It will sponsor at least one session of \nthe annual conference on a topic related to RCI that is mutually agreed upon by ADB and the \nBFA.  The  TA  will  support  the  preparation  of annual  reports.  For  wider  dissemination  and \noutreach, the TA will finance the publication of the annual reports translated into two languages \nother than English. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  support  the  AEBF\u2019s  knowledge  and  capacity-building  programs.  AEBF \ntraining programs will continue to be client-oriented. The OCO will design and deliver the \nprograms in consultation with AEBF members and observers. The TA will allow ADB to meet \nincreased training needs arising from the envisaged expansion of AEBF's regional scope. While \nit will primarily be up to AEBF members and observers to select training topics, ADB will, from \nits  perspective  as  a  potential  sponsor,  elect  to  support  topics  that  are  high  on  its  own \ndevelopment agenda. In this regard, ADB would like to help achieve (i) stronger partnership in \nAsian economies and Asian regional institutions; (ii) closer support for, and the deepening of, \npublic\u2013private partnerships; (iii) effective risk-sharing through re-guarantee and co-guarantee \ncooperation among AEBs and ECAs; and (iv) further enhancement of AEB and ECA business \npractices in corporate governance, environmental sustainability, and risk management. \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n8 During the training committee meeting held in Seoul in May 2010, the following topics were selected for the \ncurriculum 2010\u20132011: buyers\u2019 credit and structured trade, country and bank risk analysis, and the impacts of the \nimplementation of Basel II and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development export credit guidelines.   ", " \n5 \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 allocated equally to support the BFA and the \nAEBF. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional \nCooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund and administered by ADB. A detailed cost breakdown \nand financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA is expected to start in November 2010 and be completed by October 2012. It will \nbe executed by ADB and implemented by the OREI and the OCO, in close collaboration with \nthe BFA Secretariat, the AEBF chair, and its training committee chair. The OREI will lead the \nimplementation of support for the BFA annual conferences and annual reports, while the OCO \nwill lead the implementation of training for the AEBF. The BFA Secretariat is expected to be \ninvolved,  particularly  in  deciding  conference themes  and preparing  logistics for  the  annual \nconference. The AEBF will closely coordinate with ADB on the delivery of training courses. \n \n21.  International consultants with expertise related to the BFA annual conference theme will \nbe engaged cumulatively for 8 person-months to prepare the BFA annual reports. International \nconsultants or resource persons will be engaged as needed cumulatively for 4 person-months to \nconduct  training.  Two  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  intermittent  basis  for  a \nmaximum of 18 person-months. One national consultant will help oversee the implementation of \nthe TA, coordinate with the BFA, and assist in preparing the BFA annual reports. The other \nnational consultant will be engaged as the seminar and workshop coordinator for the AEBF. All \nconsultants will be hired as individuals. The selection and hiring of consultants will conform to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Supporting the Boao Forum for Asia and the Asian Exim Banks Forum in Dialogues on \nRegional Economic
