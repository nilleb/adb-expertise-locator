His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal (the Government) requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for developing an economic policy network that \ncould serve as a forum for economic policy dialogue, based on sound analysis. Advisory TA for \npolicy network was included in the country nonlending program for 2003.1 The Fact-Finding \nMission  visited  Nepal  from  27  October  to  7  November  2003.  The  Mission  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government of Nepal (the Government) regarding the goals, outputs, \nactivities, implementing arrangements, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsultants and counterpart support. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  To  achieve  the  poverty  reduction  objectives  of  the  recently  approved  Tenth  Plan \n(FY2002\u20132007),  continued  and  consensus-based  economic  policy  reforms  are  crucial. \nHowever, in Nepal, policy reform has been characterized by slippages and implementation \ndelays. Despite some recent improvements in policy reform processes, such as preparation of \nthe Tenth Plan and the Immediate Action Plan, more progress is required to meet the reform \nobjectives. \n  \n3.  Stakeholders  in  Nepal  identified  a  number  of  specific  weaknesses contributing to \nslippages in the economic policy reform process:  (i) ad hoc, top-down, and supply-driven \neconomic reform agenda; (ii) inadequate consultation processes for securing commitment and \nconsensus  from  other  stakeholders;  (iii)  failure  to  specify  appropriate  implementation \narrangements; and (vi) ineffective monitoring capacity. \n  \n4.  The Government is acutely aware of these weaknesses and failures of past attempts to \naddress them, and has requested ADB to assist in developing an institutional mechanism that \ncould serve as a forum for economic policy dialogue, based on sound analysis. The policy \ndialogue platform will focus on promoting consensus building and creating ownership of, and \ncommitment to, the economic reform process among stakeholders. Because conflict is a key \nbinding constraint to progress in Nepal and has brought to light a mosaic of deep-seeded \ndivisions within society, the need for a broad policy network constituency to support and \nconsolidate the reform process is more compelling now than at any other time in the past.  \n \n5.  The economic policy network will serve as a vehicle to (i) evolve and develop a strategic \nvision for private sector development, (ii) help improve the Government\u2019s economic policy \nreform agenda by evaluating policy reforms and providing feedback on implementation, (iii) \nrecommend  new  ideas  and  policy  options  to  policy  makers,  (iv)  assist  policy  makers  in \nanalyzing  and  responding  to  regional  and  global  economic  challenges,  and  (v)  foster  a \nconstructive policy dialogue between the Government and other institutions so as to generate a \nnational consensus on policies and thereby enhance the credibility of reforms.  \n \n6.  Based on the current economic context defined by an urgent need to accelerate pro-\npoor growth, the priorities identified in the Tenth Plan, and extensive consultations with experts \nin the public and private sectors, four cross-cutting themes have been identified for policy \ndialogue and analysis, which are of direct relevance to poverty reduction.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 May 2003.  ", "2 \n(i)  Macroeconomic  management.  A  stable  and  consistent  macroeconomic  policy \nframework is critical for sustainable poverty reduction and economic growth. Sound \nmacroeconomic management will also help strengthen financial markets, stimulating \nprivate investment. The worsening conflict situation and declining revenue growth \nhave serious implications for the national budget. Improving fiscal management, \nsustaining monetary and external stability, and developing the financial sector are \nmajor challenges.      \n \n(ii)  Economic policy on international trade, investment, and employment. As a \nsmall economy with a limited domestic market, Nepal\u2019s growth potential is closely \nlinked  to  the  global  economy.  The  economic  policy  network  could  support  the \nGovernment's  recently  approved  Integrated  Trade  and  Competitive  Strategy  by \nundertaking research on specific implementation issues and creating awareness \namong  stakeholders  of  the  key  components  of  the  strategy.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment in the agriculture, industry, and service sectors, including tourism, has a \ncritical role in this regard, as it is a principal instrument of technology transfer and \nimproved  management  practices.  Avenues  for  employment  generation  through \nmedium, small, and micro enterprise development, with focus businesses led by \nwomen, need to be explored.    \n \n(iii)  Economic policy on infrastructure development. Poor Infrastructure is a key \nconstraint  on  economic  growth.  Integrated  infrastructure  development,  linked  to \nbalanced regional development, could serve as a powerful instrument of poverty \nreduction, given the close connection between poverty and excluded development. \nImproving rural infrastructure, through access to transport, communications, and \nmarket places, rural electrification and other infrastructure are a key role in the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to build rural-urban linkages.   \n \n(iv)  Economic  policy  on  tourism  and  regional  development.  The  Tenth  Plan \nidentifies tourism as an important instrument of poverty reduction by virtue of its \npotential  for  realizing  multiple  objectives,  including  increased  income  and \nemployment opportunities, particularly in the hills and mountain areas; strengthening \nand expansion of the transportation network; development of regional markets and \nnew tourism products; and the opening up of new areas for rural tourism. Research \nin this area should include studies for addressing the effect of continued conflict in \nthe tourism sector. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will promote establishment of an operational economic policy network with active \nparticipation of stakeholders in the public and private sectors to address contemporary issues \nand concerns, and support implementation of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. In \nparticular, the TA will provide a forum for economic policy dialogue and analysis in priority areas \nand facilitate the development of a modality for enabling the public and private sectors to work \ntogether in revitalizing the economy through policy reform. These goals will be realized through \nan innovative partnership arrangement among senior policy makers, leading private sector \nentrepreneurs, opinion makers, and other experts to engage in continuing policy discourse and \nanalysis.  ", "    3 \n \n8.  The scope of the TA will cover (i) developing an institutional framework for economic \npolicy dialogue and analysis; (ii) providing assistance for policy research and analysis, data \ncollection, and information dissemination; (iii) creating a forum for policy dialogue and analysis \nthrough a vibrant partnership; and (iv) laying the groundwork for an institutionalized consultative \nprocess that will ensure continuity of the Government\u2019s economic policy reform agenda. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.      \n \n9.  The economic policy reform network is expected to produce four major outputs:  \n \n(i)  an economic policy agenda identifying challenges and concerns for promoting \nprivate sector development, as well as specific issues requiring in-depth analysis;   \n \n(ii)  about eight demand-driven, results-oriented economic policy papers per thematic \narea (giving a total of about 32 papers) deriving from the policy reform agenda \nthat will contain important findings and recommendations, backed by sound \neconomic analysis;  \n \n(iii)  establishment of improved institutional processes for policy discourse and reform \nthat are characterized by transparency and openness; and \n \n(iv)  establishment of a public-private modality for monitoring the implementation of \neconomic policy reform agendas.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support the establishment of a public-private interface for economic policy \ndialogue and analysis and catalyze constituency-building and reform. The TA will be reform-\noriented and implemented through a partnership modality, (para. 15-21). The Mission observed \nthat the confidence and trust of the private sector in the Government could be won through this \npolicy  networking  process,  which  will  help  sustain  and  institutionalize  the  network  after \ncompletion of the TA.  \n \n11.  Policy papers, the main output of the policy reform networking process, will serve as the \nbasis for policy dialogue among stakeholders in Government, the private sector, and civil \nsociety. The policy papers, backed by sound research and analysis, will be prepared mainly by \nlocal  experts,  the  most  of  whom  are  economists  and  financial  analysts  working  outside \ngovernment, i.e., in the private sector and civil society. The policy papers will be demand driven \nand  address  issues  falling  within  the  scope  of  the  four  thematic  areas.  The  policy \nrecommendations flowing from these papers will have a strong reform focus and could feed into \nthe annual budget proposals, which are prepared in accordance with the objectives and priority \nactions identified in the Tenth Plan.  \n \n12.  Policy dialogue will be undertaken through regular workshops and seminars, as well as \ninformal consultations among stakeholders. The vehicle for conveying policy recommendations \nto the political level will be a high-level steering committee, chaired by the chief secretary.   \n \n13.  ADB will finance the studies, workshops and seminars, as well all as some of the costs \nborne by the focal unit. The TA activities include: \n \n ", "4 \n(i)  establishment of a focal unit; \n(ii)  establishment of a steering committee; \n(iii)  establishment of four advisory committees; \n(iv)  selection of implementing agencies (IAs);  \n(v)  steering committee meetings to develop the policy research agenda for each \nthematic area and to evaluate progress;   \n(vi)  advisory committee and IA meetings to identify specific policy research topics, \ncommission policy studies, and monitor performance;  \n(vii)  preparation of policy papers;  \n(viii)  expert technical workshops; \n(ix)  policy seminars for stakeholders.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $260,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is \n$33,000 and the local currency cost is $227,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $200,000 on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$167,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The main components to be funded by ADB are \nthe foreign and domestic consultants, equipment, workshops and seminars, and administration \nsupport costs. The Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $60,000 \nequivalent to provide office accommodation, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars and \nmeetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency. MOF will develop a work \nplan  and  appropriate  modalities  for  TA  activities.  Appendix  3  sets  out  implementation \narrangements. \n   \n16.  Steering Committee. A steering committee, chaired the chief secretary, will be formed, \nconsisting of high-level representatives from the public and private sectors. The committee will \ndevelop a strategic vision for the economic policy network and guide the advisory committees in \ntheir networking activities.  \n  \n17.  Advisory Committees. Four advisory committees, consisting of senior experts from \npublic and private sectors, will be established by the MOF in consultation with the steering \ncommittee: one for each thematic area. The advisory committees will (i) work closely with key \nstakeholders in preparing work plans, selecting topics for research, creating a network of policy \nexperts, and engaging in policy dialogue with stakeholders; (ii) help identify resource persons \nfor conducting the policy studies, workshops, and seminars; and (iii) provide guidance and \nassistance to the focal unit in monitoring TA activities. \n \n18.  Implementing Agencies.  The IAs, selected by the steering and advisory committees, \nwill be responsible for carrying out the operational policy research agenda. The number and \ncomposition of IAs will be determined once the research agenda has been finalized. The IAs will \nsubmit work plans to the focal unit, including cost estimates and finance plans, showing the \nADB and Government contributions. The IAs will commission and publish the policy studies and \norganize technical workshops, policy reform seminars, and consultations with stakeholders. All \ndocumentary outputs of the TA will be jointly owned by ADB and the Government. The IAs will \nbe responsible for monitoring their own activities and preparing quarterly progress reports for ", "    5 \nthe focal unit.  The IAs will be guided in their work by the advisory committees and may consider \nusing service providers from the public and private sectors to assist in policy networking.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2004 to December 2005. \nTripartite  meetings  of  the  Government,  TA  consultants,  and  ADB  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of the MOF, and held semiannually to review TA implementation priorities, address \nissues arising during TA implementation, and provide guidance to the TA consultants. The \nsteering committee will meet at the beginning of the TA and every 4 months thereafter to guide \nthe TA and resolve policy and implementation issues. The advisory committees will be expected \nto meet at least once in 2 months to sustain the momentum of the policy research agenda. The \nsteering and advisory committees will invite representatives of the private sector and other \nstakeholders to make contributions.  \n \n20.  Focal Unit.  MOF will establish a focal unit in MOF\u2019s Economic Affairs and Policy \nAnalysis Division (EAPAD), to be headed by the joint secretary. The focal unit will coordinate \nthe TA activities, submit consolidated progress reports to the steering committee, and disburse \nfunds in accordance with ADB regulations. The focal unit will (i) prepare consolidated quarterly \nprogress reports on the activities of the IAs, and (ii) prepare a final report on IA activities at the \nconclusion of the TA. All reports will be submitted to the steering committee and ADB. \n \n21.  Consulting Services. One person-month  of  international  and  39  person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be provided. The international and domestic economic policy \nnetwork  consultants  will  be  selected  to  develop  operational  modalities  for  the  networking \nprocess, based on international best practices. The domestic economic consultants will be \nrequired to prepare at least 32 policy papers relating to the crosscutting themes  (para. 6). \nCompatibility  of  such  support  with  this  TA  will  be  assured  through  existing  coordination \nprocesses, and, such contributions will then operate through the focal unit. The consultants will \nbe individuals selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will be hired by the focal unit in consultation with the private sector. \nGiven the strong private sector interest in supporting the TA activities, a modality for private \nsector participation will be examined after the TA becomes operational. The TA will support \npurchase of equipment to support the policy networking process. Equipment procured under the \nTA will be handed over to MOF upon completion of the TA. Outline of terms of reference for the \nconsulting needs are attached in Appendix 4.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Establishing Economic Policy Network, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.
