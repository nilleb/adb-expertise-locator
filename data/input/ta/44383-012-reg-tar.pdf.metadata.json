INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Pacific Regional Digital Strategy calls for stronger regional cooperation among the \nPacific island countries by sharing scarce regulatory resources and harmonizing legislation and \nthe regulatory environment.1 Delegates at the Pacific Regional Information and Communication \nTechnology (ICT) Ministerial Meeting in Nuku\u2019alofa in June 2010 endorsed the establishment of \nthe Pacific ICT Regulatory Resource Centre (PIRRC). They also agreed to establish the Centre \nWorking Group (CWG) to develop the governance framework of the PIRRC.2 In April 2011, the \nICT ministers from the Pacific Islands Forum member countries endorsed the establishment of \nthe PIRRC as an operating unit under the University of the South Pacific (USP), its governance, \nand membership arrangements, and requested development partner support for the PIRRC.3  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) consulted with representatives from CWG, the \nWorld Bank, USP, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on the proposed technical \nassistance (TA) scope and implementation arrangement. The CWG, representing the Pacific \nisland  countries,  concurred  with  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome  and  outputs,  implementation \narrangement, financing plan, and consultant terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ICT supports economic growth and social development.  Recent quantitative studies \nindicate that an increase in ICT penetration has a positive impact on economic growth, and the \nimpact is larger in low- and middle-income countries than in developed countries.4 The impact \nICT  has  on  improving  education  and  health  service  delivery,  disaster  risk  reduction, \nadministrative services, etc., is well documented around the world. Pacific developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  should  harness  ICT  to  overcome  remoteness  and  dispersed  population, \nwhich result in diseconomies of scale.  \n \n4.  Market  liberalization  and  consequent  competition  in the  telecommunication  and ICT \nsectors have expanded service coverage, improved the quality, and lowered the prices of ICT \nservices in some Pacific DMCs. Many countries with monopoly operators experience slow \nimprovement in the sector. Even for a liberalized market, successful competition in the ICT \nsector requires government involvement to (i) apply rules and regulations equally and impartially, \n(ii) ensure appropriate investment signals through clear policy directions and measures, and (iii) \nprotect consumers. These are the areas where ICT regulations can improve sector performance. \n \n5.  Regulatory  systems  in the  Pacific  are  relatively  new  or  immature.  Fiji,  Papua  New \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu have liberalized the telecommunications \nmarket and, with the exception of Tonga, have established independent regulators. Most of \nthem have a legal framework for market liberalization but do not have elaborated policy and \nregulatory  rules  to  implement.  Before  liberalization,  regulatory  functions  were  imbedded  in \ngovernment ministries and were concerned primarily with technical aspects, such as spectrum \nmanagement and standardization of user apparatus. Competition policy, dispute mediation and \nresolution, public consultation, and consumer protection are new areas for Pacific regulators. In \n                                                \n1  Pacific Islands Forum. 2005. The Pacific Regional Digital Strategy. Suva.  \n2  The working group comprised representatives from Australia, Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, \nPapua New Guinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 September 2011. \n4  World Bank. 2009. Extending Reach and Increasing Impact. Information and Communications for Development. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "2   \ncountries without an independent regulator, a ministry that is responsible for the sector policy \nfrequently develops regulations and monitors compliance. Monopoly operators\u2014often owned by \nthe government\u2014were allowed to have quasi-regulatory powers, such as control of spectrum \nand  a  national  numbering  plan.  In  these  countries,  both  the  legal  framework  for  more \nindependent  regulatory  functions  and  the  regulatory  body\u2019s  institutional  capacity  need \nimprovement. The ICT sector is changing rapidly due to innovations in technology and business \npractice, which aggravate the challenges faced by Pacific DMC regulators with limited human \nand financial resources.5  \n \n6.  In summary, regulators in the Pacific face challenges in (i) market liberalization (non-\nexclusive  carrier  licenses,  spectrum  management,  interconnection  arrangement,  and  cost-\nbased pricing); (ii) universal service schemes; and (iii) institutional development for independent \noperation.  The  regulatory  capacity  becomes  more  important  in  countries  with  monopoly \noperators because their regulators have to improve market performance through policy and \nregulatory instruments in the absence of competition.  \n \n7.  The PIRRC was established to help the Pacific DMCs address these challenges. The \nPIRRC aims to become a regional telecommunications and ICT regulatory support facility with a \nrange of functions including (i) supporting information sharing and industry data collection, (ii) \nimproving awareness of sector performance across the region, (iii) providing direct assistance to \nregulators and policy makers, and (iv) assisting member countries in building their regulatory \ncapacity and adopting best practice principles and supporting legislation that is consistent with \ninternational experience.        \n \n8.  The Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility, through the World Bank, has provided $1.3 \nmillion to support the establishment of the PIRRC and its operations at a basic level of service \nfor 2011\u20142013.6 The PIRRC will collect nominal annual membership fees from each member \ncountry.  It  expects  7\u201410  countries  to  become  paying  members  by  2016  and  for  these \nmembership fees to cover most of its non-staff operational costs. However, a funding gap will \nremain in both staff and non-staff costs (training, travel, short-term consultants, etc.) for the first \n3 years of operation. Without additional funding, the PIRRC will be unable to effectively respond \nto the surging demand from Pacific DMCs.7 The credibility of the PIRRC depends on its ability to \nprovide timely, demand-driven, technically sound, and customized support until the desired \nregulatory framework and practices are established. Therefore, it is advisable for the PIRRC to \nhave more resources to provide technical advisory and capacity development services to meet \nthe high demand of existing and emerging regulators in the Pacific DMCs. Readily accessible \nadvisory services are relatively more important for smaller island countries with weak regulatory \ncapacity than for countries with independent regulators.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  augment  other  development  partners\u2019  assistance  through  the  PIRRC, \nenhancing PIRRC\u2019s services to Pacific DMCs by mobilizing an advisor and technical experts. \nThe  TA  will  also  help  the  PIRRC  build  awareness  about  the  benefits  of  improved  ICT \n                                                \n5  Examples  include  convergence  between  different  technologies,  e-commerce  (i.e.,  electronic  transactions, \nauthentication, electronic evidence, electronic and digital signatures), privacy, cyber-security, etc. \n6  The Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility funding will cover the office set-up costs in year one, staff costs (a centre \ndirector, a research assistant, an administrative secretary, a technical advisor, and a web designer), some travel \ncosts, and some operational costs for 2\u20143 years. Initially, a membership fee will be sought from seven countries to \ncover the balance of operational costs. USP will provide office space and other support services. \n7  Fiji,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  Tonga,  and  Vanuatu  will  need  support  in  building  up \nimplementation capacity, while the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, and Palau would \nneed support in revising legislation, establishing independent regulatory functions, and building implementation \ncapacity in the next 5 years.  \n ", "  3 \nregulations among the general public and policy makers (especially parliamentarians) through \nthe PIRRC website, the mass media (i.e., internet, newspapers, radio, and TV), and in-country \nevents. This will ensure that the general public, civil society, governments, and parliaments are \nable to create the demand for better ICT regulation.  \n \n10.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20142014,  which  identifies \ntransport and ICT as an operational priority.8 The TA will strengthen the technical advisory \nservice of the PIRRC so it can be established as a sustainable regional knowledge hub that \ncontributes to regional cooperation and helps to coordinate regulatory standards in cross-border \nissues in the ICT sector. Improvements in ICT policy and regulations will also create enabling \nenvironment for the private sector. Responding to the Pacific DMCs\u2019 demand for improved \nconnectivity  through  ICT,  ADB  has  been  increasing  investment  in  ICT  infrastructure  and \napplications  in  the  region.9 The  performance  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  projects  can  be  further \nenhanced by improved regulatory environment.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  The  TA  will  deliver  ICT  regulatory  advisory  services  through  the  PIRRC  that  will \ncontribute  to  (i)  sharing  experiences  and  international  best  practices  frequently,  (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity of ICT regulatory bodies and policy makers, (iii) providing demand \ndriven  advisory  services,  and  (iv)  raising  broad-based  awareness  to  demand  better  ICT \nregulations. The TA will provide two consultants\u2014an ICT regulation technical advisor and a \nmedia relations and communications officer\u2014and several short-term technical experts and will \nfund awareness-raising events. These actions will augment the existing PIRRC resources and \nincrease the relevance and effectiveness of its advisory services. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be that the population of the Pacific islands has access to ICT \nservices at affordable prices. The TA outcome will be that the PIRRC provides demand-driven \nICT regulatory advisory services based on international best practices.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA activities will be guided by the governance and working arrangement of the \nPIRRC as agreed by the CWG representing the Pacific DMCs. The TA will enhance the quality \nof advisory services and widen the available range of services by augmenting the existing \nPIRRC resources. Key activities will include:  \n \n(i)  Support to develop a PIRRC business plan for sustainable operation. The PIRRC \nwas established with the support of the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility, \nwhich will last until 2013. Capacity development takes more time, while the ICT \nsector is rapidly changing in terms of technology and business practices. The \nPacific island countries would need continued services beyond the development \npartner support. Therefore, the PIRRC needs to develop a business plan to \ndevelop  mechanisms  to  ensure  sustainable  and  continuous  support  to  its \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

The TA will support the PIRRC and its members to develop and agree \non a business plan.  \n \n(ii)  Support to publish and disseminate best practices in ICT regulations. The TA will \nprovide technical experts to help the PIRRC develop publications (booklets and \npolicy statements) on ICT regulations, especially related to cost-based retail and \nwholesale tariff, quality-of-service monitoring, spectrum pricing, and monitoring, \netc. These publications will inform Pacific island country regulators about the \ncutting edge practices that can be adapted to their environment. The TA aims to \npublish  at  least  two  information  packages  and  four  best-practice  statements \nabout ICT regulation and implementing rules.  \n \n(iii)  Support to build a community of practice among ICT regulators and experts. \nPacific regulators are new to the job and are having difficulties working in a \nregulatory and sector environment that is very different from other parts of world. \nThe TA will support the PIRRC to develop mentoring and coaching relationships \nwith the existing and future regulators in the Pacific by making expert advice \navailable  and  building  a  community  of  practice  among  peer  regulators  and \nexperts to encourage sharing experiences and lessons.  \n \n(iv)  Support to develop a media strategy and to implement a media campaign for \npublic awareness of the benefits of reforming the ICT sector. There is increasing \ndemand for cheaper and better quality communication services, but the general \npublic has little awareness of the importance of good ICT regulations for bringing \nabout cheaper and better quality services. The TA will support the PIRRC and \nPacific regulators to develop a media strategy and implement a media campaign \nto increase public awareness so that the general public can call for ICT sector \nreform and regulatory changes.   \n \n(v)  Support  to  identify  ICT  cross-border  issues  and  facilitate  discussion  among \nmember countries for regional cooperation. Considering the small size and the \nlimited human resources of the Pacific island countries, there is a large need for \nmore  regional  cooperation  in  many  areas  including  ICT.  With  businesses, \ngovernments, and individuals increasing their use of ICT, there is a need for a \nregional  approach,  especially  for  cross-border  issues  such  as  electronic \ntransactions, cyber security, interconnection, mobile roaming, etc. The TA will \nprovide technical experts to identify key issues for member countries to discuss \nand explore a regional solution to resolve at least one cross-border issue by early \n2014.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The Pacific DMCs have requested ADB to finance $750,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The Pacific \nDMC  governments  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff  time,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA implementation will commence on 1 December 2011 and be completed on 31 \nMay 2014. ADB will be the executing agency, and the Pacific Department will be the focal point \nfor  TA  management.  USP  will  assume  the  role  of  implementing  agency.  As  the  host \norganization  of  the  PIRRC,  USP  will  ensure  the  PIRRC  have  adequate  office  facility  and \norganizational support for the TA-funded consultants and activities.  \n \n16.  The TA will provide 25 person-months of international consultant with expertise in ICT \npolicy, regulation, and industry practices and with experience providing advisory services to \nmember countries. It will also provide 15 person-months of national consultant with skills and \nexperience in public and media relations and communications. In addition, it will provide 11 \nperson-months  of  international  or  national  consultants  specialized  in  specific  areas  of  ICT \nregulations. Individual consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3. An advance payment facility will be established to allow \nthe PIRRC, with the support of USP, to organize awareness-raising events. Disbursements \nunder the TA  will  be made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening  Regulatory  Capacity  for  Information  and  Communication  Technology \nDevelopment in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 2 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nPacific islands  Mobile service  Annual regional survey of  Pacific economies \npopulation has access to  penetration increases on  telecommunications and  experience moderate \nICT services at  average by 10% against  ICT markets by the  economic growth \naffordable prices  the baseline in 2011 in  PIRRC   \nPIRRC member  Risk \ncountries by 2014   High cost of \n  international \nInternet penetration  connectivity constrains \nincreases on average by  improvement in the \n10% against the  ICT sector \nbaseline in 2011 in  performance \nPIRRC member   \ncountries by 2014  \n \nMobile and internet \nprices decrease on \naverage by 10% against \nthe baseline in 2011 in \nPIRRC member \ncountries by 2014  \nOutcome      Assumption \nThe PIRRC provides  By the end of 2013, the  The PIRRC annual  Pacific DMCs are \ndemand-driven ICT  number of PIRRC  progress report and an  committed to \nregulatory advisory  members increase up to  independent evaluation  expanding the benefit \nservices based on  eight countries   of affordable ICT to all \ninternational best    populations by \npractices  By end of 2013, PIRRC  adopting improved \nmember countries have  regulatory framework \neach adopted or  and instruments based \nimproved at least one  on international best \nnew regulation based on  practices  \nbest practices    \n  Risk \nAmong ICT policy \nmakers and service \nproviders, there is \ninertia against \nchanges  \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
