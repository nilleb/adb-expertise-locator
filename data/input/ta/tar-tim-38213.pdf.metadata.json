On 6 December 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a grant of $7.73 \nmillion (subsequently reduced to $4 million) for the Microfinance Development Project. The \nProject was to support community-based opportunities for income generation and sustainable \nemployment.1 As a result, the Foundation for Poverty Reduction and the Microfinance Institution \nof Timor-Leste (IMFTL) were established and registered with the promulgation of two executive \norders in December 2001.2 The foundation is governed by its own board of trustees and wholly \nowns IMFTL, which in turn is governed by its own board of directors. IMFTL was capitalized with \n$2 million and began operations on 22 May 2002 when the Banking and Payments Authority \nissued a provisional banking license.3 On 4 September 2002, the authority issued a license for \nIMFTL to operate as a quasi-bank . \n \n2.  To support IMFTL, ADB provided two associated advisory technical assistance (TA) \ngrants to help microfinance development in Timor-Leste to (i) strengthen the microfinance policy \nand  legal  framework  (footnote  1),  and  (ii)  to  develop  microfinance  information  technology \nsystems to support the installation and adoption of the United Nations, Food and Agriculture \nOrganization, and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) microbanking \nsystem as the core banking software for the microfinance bank.4 \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  2005\u20132006  for  Timor-Leste highlights \nmicrofinance development as one of three focus areas, and proposes an additional TA to the \nsector  in  late  2004.  Since  the  Project  will  come  to  an  end  on  31  December  2004,  the \nGovernment has requested additional follow-on assistance to support IMFTL. The ADB Review \nMission from 27 July\u20135 August 2004 concluded that TA is needed to assist IMFTL in becoming \nself-sufficient.  The  Government  concurs  with  the  goal,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  ADB has taken the lead among donors involved in the Trust Fund for East Timor in \nestablishing  IMFTL  as  a  demonstration  project.  Following  donor  assistance  in  the  start-up \nphase, IMFTL now requires follow-on support to consolidate operations and help it grow and \nattain operational and financial self-sufficiency. Following the start of operations, several studies \nhave  contributed  to  IMFTL  development:  (i)  a  divestment  strategy  assessment6 of IMFTL \ncompleted in November 2003; (ii) a rating7 completed on 22 February 2004, assessing financial \nperformance as well as management, operations, and systems; (iii) business plans8 for IMFTL, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

IMFTL has generally performed well in the 26 months since its establishment given the \ndifficult environment in Timor-Leste: (i) sufficiently skilled management resources are scarce; (ii) \nthe country is slowly recovering from a postconflict situation; and (iii) the population is sparse, \nthe geography difficult, and the level of monetization is generally low, especially in rural areas. \nHowever, IMFTL continues to sustain modest operating losses. Recent assessments identify \nvarious  weaknesses  in  management  capacity,  operational  and  financial  performance,  and \nproduct and service delivery. \n \n6.  Competition. A number of nongovernment organizations and multilateral and bilateral \ndonors provide assistance to the microfinance sector. ADB is providing specific support to \nIMFTL and is coordinating with other initiatives through the Microfinance Working Group, which \nconsists  of  the  major  development  partners  involved  in  microfinance  and  is  open  to  all \nparticipants. While competition is seen as useful, overlap in overserviced areas is generally \navoided, and sharing of bad client lists is encouraged among members. \n \n7.  Market Penetration. IMFTL has a network of three branches and a head office. At the \nend of June 2004, IMFTL had 3,100 clients, up from 2,961 at the end of 2003. Over the same \nperiod, however, total outstanding loans decreased by 5% from $770,966.93 to $569,440.11, \nprimarily due to a marked decrease in activity with the lucrative payroll loan product as a result \nof increased competition. Outreach varies among customer segments. While outreach to public \nservants has been good, certain market segments, such as market vendors, need more scale  \nto attain profitability. Outreach to the rural poor has been severely hampered by insufficiently \ndesigned products and inefficient delivery mechanisms. The ability to mobilize savings deposits \nhas exceeded expectations with a total of 7,026 savings accounts amounting to $922,528.41. \nDeposits exceeded loans by 62%, indicating insufficient capacity to intermediate efficiently \nbetween savers and borrowers. \n \n8.  Revenues and Operational Performance. Operating self-sufficiency10 in the year to 30 \nJune 2004 has deteriorated significantly to 76% against 106% as of 31 March 2004 due to a \ncombination of falling market share in payroll loans, increased competition, and higher loan-loss \nprovisioning. Performance of the products in IMFTL\u2019s portfolio varies widely. The payroll loan \nhas an operating margin of 30%, while microfinance group loans lose a significant 190% of \nproduct revenues. The losses call for a careful review of (i) each product\u2019s delivery mechanism, \ndesign, and market potential; (ii) potential for introduction of new products;  (iii) systems and \nprocedures for internal control; and (iv) reengineering required in response to the findings. The \nboard of directors is not sufficiently focusing management on key performance indicators for \noutreach, efficiency, asset quality, and profitability, nor is it setting performance targets. \n \n9.  Operating Costs and Asset Quality. In several cases, overhead costs appear to be \ndisproportionately high, or not directly related to revenue generation. IMFTL\u2019s current salary \nstructure needs to  be reviewed; no staff incentives are available to reward productivity and \nasset quality. Management of loan delinquencies is lax. The past due ratio11 increased from \n3.8% at the end of 2003 to 7.7% on 30 June 2004. Similarly, the portfolio-at-risk12 increased \n                                                 \n9  Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, together with Oikocredit (based in the Netherlands) and ADB. \n10  Financial income as a proportion of financial and operating cost and loan loss provisions from 1 January\u201330 June \n2004. \n11  The ratio of overdue principal to total loans outstanding. \n12  The ratio of principal at risk to total loans outstanding. ", "  3\n \nfrom 9.45% to 16.9% (equivalent to some 10% of IMFTL\u2019s equity). This calls for measures \nfocusing  on  the  collection  of  overdue  receivables  and  implementation  of  systematic  zero-\ntolerance of loan delinquencies. \n \n10.  Human Resources. Capacity building is required to address these operational issues. \nGeneral- and second-line management need to strengthen their capacity to articulate and \ncommunicate IMFTL\u2019s vision and mission. In addition, skills need to be refined in the areas of (i) \norganizational diagnostics and implementation of mitigating measures; (ii) adequate supervision \nof staff through periodic strategic planning and budgeting, as well as regular monitoring against \nthese benchmarks; (iii) identification of client needs and adequate responses with suitable \nproducts  and  cost-effective  delivery  methodologies;  and  (iv)  establishing,  building,  and \nmaintaining client relationships. \n \n11.  The TA will assist in providing support to IMFTL with a view to ensuring sustainability in \nthe medium to long term by addressing operational issues and increasing its business. IMFTL \ncan then pursue options for divestment/dilution of shares to private sector investors, minimizing \nand\u2014circumstances permitting\u2014eventually relinquishing government and donor support. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The goal of the TA is to improve income-generating opportunities and job creation \namong the poor, in particular for women. Building on previous donor support, the purpose of the \nTA is to help IMFTL (i) increase access to microfinance services for poor people, in particular \nwomen; (ii) become self-sufficient; and (iii) divest its shares for whole or partial privatization. \n \n13.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) strengthened corporate governance and \nimproved  capacity  of  top  and  second-line  management,  as  well  as  staff;  (ii)  improved \noperational and financial performance; (iii) improved client orientation, with a particular focus on \npoor women; and (iv) business plans and a strategic plan for divestment and privatization. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA is a natural follow-on to previous TAs and other donor support. While earlier \nassistance provided capital and technical input to help establish IMFTL and start operations, this \nTA will assist IMFTL in becoming fully self-sufficient with a view to reduced dependence on\u2014\nand involvement of\u2014government and donors. The approach will be to closely engage with \nIMFTL management, the board of directors, and the Government and legislature to ensure their \nfull ownership of and buy-in to all activities under the TA. The TA will build the capacity of \nIMFTL\u2019s corporate governance and management, operational performance and monitoring, as \nwell as client orientation. The TA will also draw up a strategic plan for IMFTL\u2019s future activities. \n \n15.  The TA will take into consideration past diagnostic work, including recent work for \nIMFTL, such as the microcredit ratings study and the appraisal by the Consultative Group to \nAssist the Poor. Specifically, the following will be undertaken. \n \n16.  Corporate  Governance.  (i)  Review  organizational  culture  and  design,  and  the \nremuneration structure to improve productivity, and reengineer as appropriate. (ii) Review the \ncapacity of members of the board of directors and senior management; and identify and execute \nappropriate general management training, including exposure to other institutions. (iii) Review \n ", "4  \noperations  staff  competencies,  work  ethics,  and  productivity;  and  identify  and  execute \nappropriate training. (iv) Continuously engage\u2014and ensure ownership and buy-in from\u2014the \nIMFTL board of directors, management, and staff, as well as the Government on IMFTL \nbusiness  plans,  organizational  reengineering,  and  divestment/dilution  plans.  (v)  Undertake \npolicy dialogue with the Government, legislature, and supervisory authorities, as relevant, on \nmicrofinance best practices. (vi) Identify and cultivate microfinance champions in Timor-Leste \nand potential managers inside and outside IMFTL. \n \n17.  Operational Performance and Monitoring. (i) Provide hands-on training for the board \nof directors and top and second-line management on organizational diagnostics and mitigation \nmeasures, including effective use of management information systems; adequate supervision of \nstaff; identification of and focus on client needs; establishing, building, and maintaining client \nrelationships; monitoring performance indicators; and setting performance targets. (ii) Review \nand improve the management information system. (iii) Study the feasibility for IMFTL branch or \nsatellite office expansion, and execute plans. (iv) Review operational cost structure (including \nimputed costs), and implement measures to ensure operational efficiency. (v) Review and \nstrengthen  internal  financial  control  and  audit.  (vi)  Implement  zero-tolerance  delinquency \nmanagement, and establish referral systems with other multilateral financial institutions and with \nbusiness development centers \n \n18.   Client Orientation. (i) Review the market potential of each IMFTL product and adjust \nthe design (including pricing and tenor of loans and savings) and delivery mechanism  in \nparticular to target poor rural women. Provide hands-on training at the field level to operations \nstaff. (ii) Review the product mix and consider new products, in particular domestic money \ntransfers, and cross selling of insurance products, as well as wholesale loans to reach poor \nwomen \n \n19.   Business Plans and Strategic Plan. (i) Prepare business plans and update regularly \nwith full buy-in of the board of directors and management; review IMFTL\u2019s financial structure, \nand prepare a strategic plan in consultation with stakeholders for divestment/dilution of IMFTL \nshares. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $590,000 equivalent with a foreign exchange cost of \n$500,000 and local currency cost of $90,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 to finance \nthe foreign exchange costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government and IMFTL will contribute $90,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The Ministry of Development and Environment will be the Executing Agency for the TA. \nTwo international consultants will be required for a total of 44 person-months: 1 co-general \nmanager and 1 microfinance specialist.  \n \n22.  The co-general manager (to be recruited for 24 person-months and deployed on a full-\ntime  basis)  will  need  banking  experience,  preferably  from  a  developing  country  context; \nmanagement skills; experience with and an appreciation of best practices in microfinance; and \npreferably be conversant in Bahasa Indonesia and/or Tetum. During the first 3 months, the ", "  5\n \nconsultant will develop, in close consultation with the Ministry of Development and Environment, \nthe detailed terms of reference for the microfinance specialist, and help with recruitment. \n \n23.  The microfinance specialist (to be engaged for 20 person-months on a full-time basis) \nwill assist with day-to-day management of field operations and provide hands-on training to field \nstaff. The qualifications of the specialist will include extensive experience with field-level loan \nprocessing from identification of clients and loan collection, and ability to converse in Bahasa \nIndonesia and/or Tetum. \n \n24.  Both  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and \nIts Borrowers using quality-based selection. The outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  The TA will allow for the purchase of 2 laptop computers. Other office equipment will be \nprovided by IMFTL. A vehicle will be provided from the Microfinance Development Project as \ncounterpart  financing.  Equipment  for  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n26.  Within 1 month of TA inception, the lead consultant will submit an inception report \noutlining the work program for the TA. After 3 months of TA inception, an initial report will be \nsubmitted containing (i) updated diagnostics and a business plan for IMFTL, (ii) measures taken \nand plans to improve corporate governance and management capacity, self-sufficiency, and \nclient orientation. The report will also include a work program for TA implementation, and budget \nprojections. Subsequent reports will be submitted every 3 months, and a financial status of \nIMFTL at least monthly. The final report containing lessons learned and a business plan for \nIMFTL will be submitted at the end of TA implementation. Implementation will be based on a \nprinciple of flexibility to meet evolving and emerging needs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Strengthening Microfinance \nOperations, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " \n6\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK       A\np\np\n  e\nn\nd\n        ix\nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions   1\n \n    and Risks \n \nGoal       \nImproved income-generating opportunities  Number of Microfinance Institution of Timor-Leste  IMFTL management   \nand job creation among the poor, in  (IMFTL) savers and borrowers (in particular  information system (MIS), \nparticular women  women)  Government records, \nAmount of cumulative loans and savings  consultant reports, client \nAmount of outstanding loans and savings  surveys, and Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) \nreview missions \n \nPurpose       \nAssist IMFTL to (i) increase access to  Number of IMFTL clients by gender and by  IMFTL MIS, Government  Stable peace and order \nmicrofinance services for poor people, in  product, and demand-driven product and service  records, consultant reports,  situation \nparticular women;   mix  client surveys, and ADB   \n    review missions \n(ii) become self-sufficient  Operational- and financial self-sufficiency \n   \n  Improved professional capacity and attitude of the \n(iii) wholly or partially privatize  IMFTL board of directors and top- and second-line \n  management \n \nReduced government and donor exposure to \nIMFTL; private sector participation \n       \nOutputs       \n1.
