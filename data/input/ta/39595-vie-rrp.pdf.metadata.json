A summary environmental impact assessment was \nAssessment  prepared and circulated to the Board of Directors of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on 14 August 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Government has identified the 1,000-megawatt (MW) Mong \n  Duong 1 Thermal Power Project (the Project) as a priority power \n  generation project for meeting the country\u2019s rapidly growing power \n  demand.  A  least-cost  power  generation  option,  the  Project  is \n  included in the 6th Power Development Master Plan (2006\u20132015) \n  with an outlook until 2025. The Project involves building a 1,000 \n  MW  coal-fired  thermal  power  generating  station  that  uses \n  circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler technology\u2014a \u201ccleaner coal\u201d \n  technology. The Project is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012. \n  Common facilities for the next phase of the power plant also are \n  included within the project scope. These facilities will support the \n  expansion of Mong Duong thermal power complex through the \nconstruction  of  the  1,000\u20131,200  MW  Mong  Duong  2  thermal \npower project, which is being formulated. The private sector will \nbuild the Mong Duong 2, which is aimed for commissioning by \n2013, under a build-operate-transfer arrangement. The Project will \nalso  provide  appropriate  institutional  and  technical  capacity \nbuilding, particularly in CFB boiler technology and operation.   \n   \nRationale  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been growing at about 7.5% a year over \nthe past decade, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth in \n2006 reaching 8.2%. The Government is determined to maintain \nthe high economic growth of 8%\u20138.5% in the country\u2019s 5-year \nsocioeconomic  development  plan  (for  2006\u20132010)  to  reduce \npoverty to 11%\u201315% by 2010. To sustain this economic growth, a \nreliable supply of electricity is essential, as electricity is central to \nalmost  every  aspect  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustainable  socioeconomic \ndevelopment:  job  creation,  industrial  activities,  commerce  and \nbusinesses, and other drivers of economic growth and people\u2019s \nwell-being. Following Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  in  2007,  foreign  direct  investment  and \ndomestic  investment  have  increased  substantially,  with  new \nbusinesses being established at an ever-increasing rate.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  updated  Sixth  Power  Development  Master \nPlan (2006\u20132015) envisages power demand to grow at 16% per ", "ii     \nyear until 2011, and at 11% per year thereafter until 2015. This \nmight prove to be conservative, since power demand growth over \nthe first quarter of 2007 has been about 20% The drivers of this \ndemand\u2014rapid industrialization, establishment of industrial zones, \nincreasing  foreign  direct  investment,  and  increasing  trade \nfollowing  WTO  accession\u2014show  little  sign  of  diminishing. \nReflecting this rapidly increasing demand, which is fast outpacing \nthe country\u2019s generation capacity, Viet Nam is experiencing power \noutages, and these will increase unless new generation capacity \nis added quickly.  \n \nThe  high  growth  rate  in  electricity  demand,  coupled  with  the \ncountry\u2019s disproportionate dependency on hydropower, has left \nViet  Nam  with  dangerously  low  reserves  during  annual  dry \nseasons, when limited river flows reduce hydropower output to \nabout 40%\u201350% of rated output. Without significant increases in \nthermal  plant  generation  capacity,  the  continuing  demand  for \nelectricity would reduce system reserve capacity to zero by 2010. \nViet Nam Electricity (EVN), therefore, plans to develop thermal \npower plants urgently based on coal, including Mong Duong 1, to \naddress system imbalances and seasonal generation shortages.  \n \nThe Government has made a policy decision to use domestic and \nimported coal to ensure security of electricity supply. Under the \nupdated 6th Power Development Master Plan, coal power plants \nare to provide for essential base-load power generation. Coal\u2019s \nshare in the country\u2019s generation mix will more than double from \n16% (in 2006) to 34% in 2020, while the share of hydropower will \nfall gradually from 37% in 2006 to 27% in 2020. Nevertheless, \nhydropower  will  remain  the  second  largest  component  in  the \ngeneration capacity mix. The proposed Project is in Quang Ninh \nProvince  of  northern  Viet  Nam,  where  coal  is  abundant\u2014\naccounting for 90% of the country\u2019s coal reserves. Viet Nam is a \nsignatory to the Kyoto Protocol, though it is not required to reduce \ncarbon emissions under the agreement, which lasts until 2012.  \n \nThe  2005  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange shows that Viet Nam emits 0.3 tons of carbon dioxide \n(CO ) per capita, compared with 6.3 tons per capita by Japan, 8.8 \n2\ntons per capita by the United Kingdom, and 20.6 tons per capita \nby  the  United  States  of  America.  As  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy \ndevelops, its consumption of energy will increase to sustain the \neconomic growth and reduce poverty to 15%. In this context, Viet \nNam is aware that the country\u2019s CO  emissions will increase, and \n2\nis using clean coal technologies in power generation to reduce \nCO  emissions. \n2\n \nIn  recognizing  its  fiscal  constraints  to  meet  all  investment \ndemands  for  infrastructure  development,  the  Government \nrequested  assistance  from  ADB  in  developing  a  new  thermal \npower  generation  project  in  2007,  in  the  northern  part  of  the \ncountry to meet the country\u2019s growing demand for electricity. The \n ", "    iii \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s 2005 Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate  for  Viet  Nam  included  a  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) in 2007 to prepare a second power generation \nproject and an investment loan in 2008 to finance a portion of the \npower generation project. To bring the investment loan forward a \nTA1 was provided in 2005. An ADB appraisal mission visited Viet \nNam in August 2006 and this report is based on the agreements \nreached during the mission. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will foster sustainable national economic growth, and \ngenerate employment. Expanding power generation capacity and \nproviding reliable power supplies will support the Government\u2019s \nefforts to accelerate poverty reduction. Improving the reliability of \nthe  power  supply  during  the  dry  season  will  ensure  a  stable \nsupply of electricity to meet the growing demand of industrial, \ncommercial, residential, and rural consumers, preventing further \nload  shedding. 2  The  Project  will  also  address  the  current \nimbalance between hydropower and thermal generation capacity \nin the power system by increasing base-load thermal generation. \nFurther, the Project will support private sector development in the \npower  sector.  By  financing  the  required  common  facilities  for \nMong Duong 2, the Project permits EVN to award that project on a \nstand-alone basis for private sector participatory development. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost $1,099.60 million, of which ADB \nwill provide $930.71 million, excluding taxes and duties of $39.76 \nmillion    \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank   930.71  84.6 \nGovernment  168.89  15.4 \n   \n  Total  1,099.60  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

This represents \n84.6%  of  total  project  financing  costs.  In  particular,  the \nGovernment has requested the ADB financing in two loans under \nthe MFF. The first requested loan under the MFF is for $27.86 \nmillion, while the second is expected to be for the balance of \n$902.85  million.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments and Modalities, the Government will submit signed \nperiodic financing requests (PFR) to ADB, which will trigger the \nsubsequent loan. The Government has agreed to enter into a \nframework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. This agreement \nis in a form consistent with the requirements of Appendix 4 of \nADB\u2019s Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Pursuant to the \nFFA, the Government will submit to ADB a PFR for $27.86 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). The form of this \nPFR for the first loan is presented to the Board along with the \nFFA. Before accepting the subsequent PFR, ADB will ensure that \nthe  Government  and  EVN  fully  comply  with  the  terms  and \nconditions of the FFA. ADB missions will conduct due diligence on \nthese to ensure that they are being adhered to satisfactorily.  \n \nThe  Government  selected  two  loans  under  the  MFF  as  its \npreferred mode of financing for the Project, rather than adopting a \ntraditional project loan, largely due to (i) the loan being almost $1 \nbillion, when only about $27.86 million is needed in the first 2 \nyears; (ii) the need for sufficient time to design, bid, negotiate, and \naward  the  main  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction \n(EPC)  contract  to  a  suitable  contractor  (to  be  selected  under \ninternational competitive bidding, following ADB guidelines); and \n(iii) apprehension that bids for the EPC contract could escalate \nunless the bidding community sees that financing is firmly in place \nbeforehand. \n ", "    v \n \nThe initial loan of $27.86 million will be used for (i) procurement of \ncivil works to prepare the site for the Mong Duong 1 thermal \npower  plant,  which  includes  leveling  of  the  project  site,  river \ndiversion  works,  and  supply  of  equipment  for  constructing  a \ntransmission  line  for  power  supply;  (ii)  consulting  services  for \nreviewing  and  updating  the  technical  designs  and  drawings, \npreparing  bid  documents  for  selection  of  the  EPC  contractor, \nassisting EVN in contract negotiations, and supervising the civil \nworks contracts under item (i); and (iii) consulting services for \nupdating  the  environmental  management  plan,  updating  the \nresettlement plan, and supervising their implementation. The site \nleveling works and river diversion works will take about 20 months \nto complete. During this period, EVN will undertake bidding and \nselection  of  an  EPC  contractor,  and  then  proceed  to  contract \nnegotiations  and  contract  award.  Also  during  this  period,  the \nconsultants  will  assist  EVN  in  updating  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and resettlement plan, and will supervise their \nimplementation.  Given  the  uncertainty  of  timing  in  such  large \ncontract  negotiations,  the  Government  prudently  has  opted  to \ndefer the second, larger loan to avoid payment of commitment \nfees over a long period. Hence, the timing of the second loan is \ntargeted for when the EPC contractor has been selected and the \nEPC contract is substantially ready for award. \n \nEach loan will have a repayment period of 25 years. The first loan \nwill have a grace period of 6 years, while the second will have a 4-\nyear  grace  period.  The  interest  rate  will  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The Government can choose from eligible \ncurrencies and the interest rate regime most suitable for each \nloan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of  repayment  and \ninterest rate swaps during the financing period. The Borrower will \nbe the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Viet Nam will make both loans under the MFF \nTerms  available  to  EVN  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  subsidiary  loan \nagreements and project agreements.   \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  A 6-year implementation period (2007\u20132013) is planned for the \nMFF.  Each  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  its \nimplementation period. \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  EVN \n   \nImplementation  The Thermal Power Project Management Unit 1 will implement \nArrangements  the Project. \n   \nProcurement  Equipment and materials to be financed under the MFF will be \n ", "vi     \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for (i) the EPC \ncontract  of  the  power  plant  and  common  facilities,  (ii)  supply \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more, \nand (iii) civil works contracts valued at more than $3.0 million. \nNational competitive bidding (NCB) or limited international bidding \nwill be used for supply contracts less than $1.0 million. Civil works \ncontracts  estimated  at  less  than  $3.0  million  will  be  procured \nfollowing  NCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Miscellaneous \ngoods  and  civil  works  contracts  less  than  $100,000  will  be \nprocured using shopping procedures. Contract packages will be \nprepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under  ICB.  Similar \ncontractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to \nother subprojects.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Government has requested advance action for recruitment of \nconsultants,  who  will  prepare  the  bidding  documents  for \nrecruitment of the EPC contractor and civil works contracts, to \nallow site preparation works to begin promptly. In August 2006, \nADB  Management  approved  advance  action  for  consultants. \nConsulting services will be required to (i) review technical designs, \n(ii) prepare bid documents for the EPC contract, (iii) supervise site \npreparation  civil  works,  (iv)  update  the  resettlement  plan  and \nmonitor  its  implementation,  (v)  update  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and monitor its implementation, (vi) conduct a \nsocioeconomic  impact  assessment  of  the  health  situation,  (vii) \nmonitor  project  performance,  and  (viii)  supervise  the  EPC \ncontractor.  EVN  will  select  and  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nConsulting  firms,  chosen  in  international  competition  using  the \nquality-and cost-based selection method, will provide the services. \nIndividual  experts  may  be  recruited  based  on  curriculum  vitae \nsubmitted  in  response  to  specific  terms  of  reference  for  the \nassignment.  Two  recruitments  of  consulting  services  will  be \nundertaken for the Project. The first recruitment will be to assist \nEVN with (i) reviewing the bid documents for selection of the EPC \ncontract,  and  subsequent  negotiations  and  award  of  the  EPC \ncontract; (ii) reviewing civil works bid documents, followed by the \nbidding, awarding of contract, and supervision of civil works; (iii) \nupdating the environmental management plan and resettlement \nplan; and (iv) supervising the environmental management plan \nand resettlement plan. EVN completed short-listing of consultants \nfor  the  first  recruitment  in  June  2007  and  submitted  the  draft \nrequest  for  proposal  to  ADB  in  July  2007  for  approval.  The \nrequest for proposals will be issued in August 2007. The second \nconsultant  recruitment  will  assist  EVN  with  the  overall \nmanagement of the Project, supervision of the EPC contract and \ncivil  works  contracts,  and  continued  monitoring  of  EMP \nimplementation. Consulting inputs will total 820 person-months, \ncomprising 556 person-months of international consulting services \nand 264 person-months of national consulting services.  \n   \n ", "    vii \nDisbursements  The proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, both as amended from time to time. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The construction of the 1,000 MW Mong Duong 1 power plant, \nBeneficiaries  together with site preparation and the common facilities for Mong \nDuong 2, will provide reliable electricity supply throughout the year \nin northern Viet Nam. The main beneficiaries of the Project will be \nthe  industrial,  commercial,  residential,  and  rural  consumers  in \nnorthern  Viet  Nam.  Indirectly,  consumers  will  benefit  from \nimproved  system  frequency  and  the  elimination  of  voltage \nfluctuations,  resulting  in  better  performance  and  longer  life  of \nelectrical equipment. EVN will not have to resort to load shedding, \nwhich will support the development of the northeast region, where \nnumerous industrial estates are established. The stable supply of \nelectricity to northern Viet Nam will stimulate economic growth, \nand increase employment and income-earning opportunities for \nthe  poor.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the \nProject is estimated at 22.5%. The financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) is estimated at 7.5%, which is higher that the 2.97% real \nweighted average cost of capital. The Project will also generate \ndirect employment in the project area through construction of the \nMong  Duong  power  complex,  incremental  coal  mining,  and \nlimestone mining activities. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  be  subject  to  any  significant \ntechnical risks. EVN has proven experience, and has performed \nwell  in  implementing  internationally  financed  power  projects. \nCapacity building of EVN technical staff under the Project will \nimprove operational knowledge and skills regarding CFB boiler \ntechnology. The financial and economic robustness of the Project \nhas been evaluated, taking into consideration possible variations \nof key parameters. The main factors that might pose risks to the \nfinancial and economic viability of the Project are (i) lower demand \nfor  electricity,  resulting  in  less  production  and  sales  from  the \nProject; (ii) higher-than-expected construction costs; (iii) possible \ndelays in tariff increases; and (iv) delays in project construction, \ncompared with the planned schedule. \n \nTo evaluate these risks, financial and economic analyses were \nconducted using various scenarios, including reduced production \nor sale of electricity by up to 20%, higher project costs by up to \n10%,  and  delayed  project  implementation  by  1  year.  For \ncombinations of theses scenarios, the EIRR and FIRR still meet \nacceptable criteria.  In addition,  sector  analysis  shows  that  the \ndemand  for  electricity  is  unlikely  to  fall  significantly.  The \nGovernment has committed to gradually increasing tariffs to cover \nlong-run  marginal  production  costs.  In  October  2006,  the \nGovernment approved an increase of 8.8% in the average tariff, \nwhich took effect on 1 January 2007. \n \n ", "viii    \nThe social risks include resettlement, possible spread of HIV/AIDS \nduring construction, possible human trafficking, and deteriorating \nhealth  conditions  after  plant  operation.  Appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures  are  in  place  in  the  resettlement  plan  for  increasing \nawareness and implementing preventive measures for the local \ncommunities. Technical assistance is being formulated that will \nassist EVN in preparing an environmental action plan to improve \npollution control and environmental management of thermal power \nplants.  The  technical  assistance  will  also  help  build  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  project  province\u2019s  Department  of \nNatural Resources and Environment on air quality management to \nminimize air pollution impacts from thermal power projects in the \nprovince. It will also assist in establishing baseline data for air \nquality monitoring in the project\u2019 vicinity. \n \nA  possible  risk  is  that  the  Project  could  be  completed  under \nfinancing provided by parties that do not require ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies  to  be  applied  to  the  EPC  contract  for  the  Project. \nHowever, ADB\u2019s strong and successful relationship with EVN, and \nits satisfactory and responsible performance in earlier projects, \nmitigates this risk considerably. \n \nAdditional  analysis  was  carried  out  to  examine  the  possible \nimpacts of a large investment such as this on the country's overall \ndebt  sustainability  and  macroeconomic  situation.  The  analysis \nshows that the Mong Duong 1 investment does not alter the debt \nsustainability of the country in the medium to long term, because \nthe disbursement of the loan is well within the annual OCR limit. \nThe Project will not have significant effects on the prices of goods \nand services supplied to the Project. Further, it will not affect \ndomestic inflation, because more than 70% of the ADB loan will \nbe allocated to the EPC contractor, which will import most of the \nrequired  equipment.  Finally,  Mong  Duong  1  is  a  revenue-\ngenerating project that will comfortably generate sufficient income \nto repay its associated loans.  \n \n \n ", "Map 1\n103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC  OF  CHINA\nVIET NAM\nHa Giang\n9Cao Bang MONG DUONG 1 THERMAL\n7\nPOWER PROJECT\n1 Lao Cai 6 10\nLai Chau 4 Bac Kan\nPROVINCES Tuyen Quang Lang Son\n1.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Mong Duong 1 \nThermal Power Project (the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Macroeconomic Performance  \n \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown on average about 7.5% a year \nover the past decade. This strong economic growth has enabled the country to reduce poverty \nfrom 58% of the population in 1993 to 20% in 2006, while increasing per capita income from \n$288 to $644 in the same period. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010, \nwhich was endorsed at the 10th Party Congress in April 2006, envisages reducing poverty to \n10%\u201311%, increasing per capita income to about $1,100, and doubling GDP by 2010. This \nimplies annual GDP growth of 7.5%\u20138% during that period. In this context, the Socio-economic \nDevelopment  Plan  emphasizes  the  role  of  physical  infrastructure1 in  increasing  national \ncompetitiveness  and  market  access,  and  attracting  investments  needed  to  sustain  strong \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  plan  also  stresses  the  importance  of  good \ngovernance,  private  sector  participation,  and  integration  with  the  global  economy  through \nmembership in the World Trade Organization. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country \nstrategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  2007\u201320102 supports  the  main  objectives  of  the  Socio-\neconomic  Development  Plan.  These  include  achieving  a  balance  between  businesses-led \neconomic  growth,  social  equity,  and  environment  sustainability,  while  strengthening  the \ngovernance of public sector institutions and supporting private sector investments in productive \nsectors  of  the  economy.  The  CSP  highlights  the  importance  of  removing  infrastructure \nbottlenecks in the power and transport sectors to increase the competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s \nprivate sector-led manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \n  2.  Power Sector Performance \n3.  Vietnam Electricity (formerly Electricity of Viet Nam [EVN]) was formed as a vertically \nintegrated state-owned corporation responsible for Viet Nam\u2019s power sector. EVN is organized \ninto  multiple  strategic  business  units  with  generation  and  power  transmission  units. \nTransmission  facilities  above  110  kilovolt  (kV)  are  established  as  non-revenue  dependent \naccounting units (cost centers), while power distribution utilities are independent accounting \nunits (profit centers). EVN\u2019s plant generation capacity mix is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Viet Nam Power Sector Capacity Mix, 2006 (MW) \n \nType of Plant  EVN  Other SOE  IPP  Total \nHydroelectric  4,069  150    4,219 \nCoal  1,245  210    1,455 \nNatural Gas   3,037    1,466  4,503 \nFurnace Oil     200   64     700     964 \nDiesel     245         245 \n   Total  8,796  424  2,166  11,386 \nEVN = Viet Nam Electricity, IPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt, SOE = state-\nowned enterprise. \nSource: Institute of Energy.  \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2005.

Hydroelectric  plants  are  located  throughout  the  country,  with  most  of  the  large \nhydropower projects located in north and central regions. Coal-fired thermal power plants are \nprimarily in the coal-rich Quang Ninh Province, while the natural gas power plants are close to \nthe natural gas fields in southern Viet Nam. The transmission network consists of more than \n3,000 kilometers (km) of 500 kV double-circuit \u201cbackbone\u201d transmission line from north to south, \nand  220  kV  and  110  kV  transmission  network  connecting  the  load  centers  to  the  main \ntransmission network. Ongoing high-voltage transmission augmentation is aimed at completing \nthe 500 kV transmission ring networks around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In the distribution \nsector, EVN3 subsidiaries purchase bulk power from EVN at administratively fixed bulk power \ntariffs at 110 kV, and are responsible for distribution and sales to end users. EVN sets bulk \ntariffs to enable each power distribution company to achieve a reasonable profit irrespective of \nits cost structure. The Ministry of Industry (MOI) is responsible for overall policy and oversight of \nthe  power  sector,  including  the  regulation  of  the  sector  through  the  recently  established \nElectricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam. \n \n5.  Viet Nam\u2019s electrification ratio is 92%, compared with 50% in 1995. Despite the rapid \ngrowth in electricity demand in recent years, per capita electricity consumption in Viet Nam \nremains low at 549 kilowatt-hours (kWh) relative to other regional developing countries. This is \nlargely because Viet Nam is growing rapidly from a very low development base. Per capita \nconsumption is projected to reach the level of Thailand in 2015 and Malaysia4 in 2023, as Viet \nNam\u2019s economy develops, thus requiring more electricity to meet the demand growth of the \nindustrial, commercial, and residential sectors. Projected electricity demand is summarized in \nTable 2. \n \nTable 2: Electricity Demand Projection (2005\u20132025) \nItem  2005  2010  2015  2020  2025 \nAnnual Demand (TWh)  45.6  97.1  164.9 257.3  381.2\nGrowth in Demand (next 5 years)  16.1%  11.1%  9.3% 8.1%  \u2014 \nT&D Losses and Self Generation  14.7%  13.8%  13.2% 12.5%  11.7%\nAnnual Generation (TWh)  53.6  112.7  190.0 294.0  431.6\nPeak Demand (MW)  9,500  19,550  32,200 48,650  71,400\nPer Capita Consumption  549   1,106  1,774 2,629  3,703\n\u2014 = data not available, MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution, TWh = terawatt-hours. \nSource: Viet Nam Electricity and Institute of Energy. \n \n6.  The 6th Power Development Master Plan (PDMP),5 prepared by the Institute of Energy \n(IOE), adopted a number of variables, including a key assumption that GDP would continue to \ngrow  for  the  base  case  scenario at  7.5%  per  year  to  2020.  The  corresponding  electricity \ndemand is forecast to grow more quickly at 16.0% per year over 2006\u20132010. This growth is \nprojected to slow to 11.0% per annum over the following 5 years, and then settle at 9.0% per \nyear for the remainder of the period of the plan. The electricity demand growth during the 6th \nPDMP is remarkable by international standards, especially to 2015 when double-digit growth is \nforecast to continue. Electricity demand growth from 2006 to 2010 alone will more than double \nthe current installed generating capacity.6 Additional plant capacity required to 2020 to meet \nanticipated base case electricity demand is shown in Table 3. The IOE considered hydropower \nplants, gas power plants, coal power plants, renewable energy plants, and electricity imports in \nits model to determine the least-cost generation expansion plan for the country.  \n \n                                                 \n3  In 2006, the Government transformed EVN into Vietnam Electricity based on a holding company structure. When \nthis transformation is completed in 2009, EVN\u2019s present operating units will become subsidiaries of the new holding \ncompany. It is intended for most of these subsidiaries to be equitized (partially privatized). \n4  Per capita electricity consumption is 3,125 kWh in Malaysia, 4,300 kWh in Singapore, and 1,946 kWh in Thailand. \n5  The 6th PDMP was revised to take account of the load growth and was approved on 16 July 2007. \n6  Electricity demand in the first four months of 2007 has grown by 20% compared to last year\u2019s demand growth. \n ", "    3 \nTable 3: Power Plant Capacity Mix to 2020 \nPlant Type  Capacity (MW)  Average Mw \n2006  2010  2015  2020  Added/Year \nCoal  2,000  15.8%  6,595  25.2%  9,290  22.1%  20,890  33.7%  1,349  38.0% \nOil And Gas  5,455  43.1%  9,072  34.6%  13,624  32.4%  15,064  24.3%  686  19.3% \nHydro  4,530  35.8%  9,412  35.9%  15,278  36.4%  16,578  26.7%  861  24.2% \nImports  600  4.7%  658  2.5%  2,695  6.4%  4,756  7.7%  328  9.2% \nOthers   67  0.6%  472  1.8%  1,130  2.7%  4,700  7.6%  331  9.3% \nTotal  12,652    26,209    42,017    61,988    3,555   \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Institute of Energy. \n \n7.  Due to the swift growth in electricity demand, the country's power system is already \nexperiencing dangerously low reserves during the dry season, when output from hydropower \nplants declines to about 40\u201350% of rated capacity. Over 2006\u20132010, the average peak load \nduring dry seasons is forecast to be about 13,750 megawatts (MW), with a reserve margin \n(capacity)  of  only  about  3.6%.  Considerably  larger  margins  of  around  20%  are  desirable, \ndepending on optimal reliability criteria for the system. The gas-fueled power plants in the south \ncan supply only part of the central and north Viet Nam power demand deficit,7 though at a \nhigher transmission cost. As a result, Viet Nam is importing electricity (600 MW) from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China during the dry season to meet demand in the north. Given this \ndemand and supply imbalance, the Government identified8 14 power generation projects for \ncompletion by 2013. The Mong Duong power complex is one of these priority projects. \n \n8.  The 6th PDMP prioritizes coal power plants for key base-load generation. As a result, \ncoal\u2019s share in the generation mix will increase from 16% (in 2006) to about 34% in 2020, while \nthe share of hydropower and renewables will fall from 36% in 2006 to about 27% in 2020. \nNevertheless, hydropower will remain the second largest component of the generation mix. The \nproposed Project is in Quang Ninh Province, north of Hanoi, where coal is abundant. Coal \nproduction, which is currently about 35 million metric tons (mt) per year, will increase to 45 \nmillion mt by 2010. Proven reserves within the province are about 10 billion mt, which is \nestimated to be sufficient for more than 200 years. \n \n9.  Given the high international oil prices, the Government has made a policy decision to \nprioritize domestic coal-fueled power plants in its generation expansion program to ensure \nsecurity of electricity supply\u2014a key consideration to sustaining high levels of economic growth. \nThe country\u2019s first nuclear power plant is planned to be operational by 2020, and legislation on \nnuclear electricity production and related safety aspects is being prepared. The Government \ntargets overseas training on nuclear technology for some 300 engineers and 500 technicians by \n2015. In the near term, additional coal-fired power plants9 will be built. Under the 5th PDMP \n(2001-2010 with an outlook till 2020), the proposed Mong Duong 1 and Mong Duong 2 thermal \npower plants were to be commissioned by 2013 and 2016, respectively. But, these plants are \nnow being accelerated to meet the revised electricity demand scenario. The need for early \ncommissioning of these plants has placed emphasis on preparatory work to begin in 2006. The \n                                                 \n7  During this period, the north and central regions will have on average power deficits of 1,127 MW and 106 MW, \nrespectively, while the south will have a surplus of 532 MW. During the wet season, the north still will have a deficit \nof 550 MW, though this can be compensated by power transfers from the central and the south regions (which will \nhave surplus power of 809 MW and 297 MW, respectively).  \n8  Decision No 1195/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister, dated 9 November 2005, addressed specific policies, procedures, \nand structure for project financing of selected urgent power generation project in 2006\u20132010. \n9  Uong Bi (710 MW), Quang Ninh (1,200 MW), Cam Pha (600 MW), Hai Phong (1,200 MW), Mao Khe (300 MW), \nVung Ang (1,200 MW), Nghi Son (600 MW), and Ninh Binh (300 MW) are under construction with assistance from \nJapan, People\u2019s Republic of China, and state-owned enterprises such as Vinacomin and Lilama. Further, EVN \nplans to build 8 new coal power stations with a capacity of about 15,000 MW to be commissioned from 2013 to \n2015 to meet the growing power demand. \n ", "4     \nProject includes construction of the associated common facilities for Mong Duong 2, for which \nfinancing arrangements are being formulated. It is assigned for development by the private \nsector,  under  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  scheme,  and  will  incorporate  a  public-private \npartnership  arrangement.10 Accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  and  private  sector  operations \ndepartments have been working closely together on developing both phases of the Mong Duong \npower complex.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n10.  ADB\u2019s approach has been to provide financial and institutional support for power sector \ndevelopment to help the Government achieve its development objectives. ADB\u2019s development \nassistance strategy has focused on (i) expanding and strengthening the country\u2019s high-voltage \ntransmission  backbone  network;  (ii)  developing  least-cost  generation  projects  (hydro  and \nthermal) to meet growing power demand; (iii) promoting financial and fiscal sustainability by \nunbundling EVN into generation, transmission, and distribution companies that can operate as \ncommercially viable and financially independent entities; (iv) creating an enabling environment \nfor  private  sector  participation  in  a  competitive  power  market  in  Viet  Nam;  (v) promoting \nrenewable  energy  sources  for  power  generation  in  rural  areas;  and  (vi) promoting  power \ninterconnections in the Greater Mekong Subregion to allow power trading within the region by \nusing the difference in peak load demand, and taking advantage of the spare capacities within \nhigh-voltage power transmission networks. Within ADB, the public sector and private sector staff \nhave cooperated closely to support the development of public-private partnerships in the power \nsector, such as promoting the partnership to develop Mong Duong 1 and 2 projects jointly.11 \nFurther, ADB has engaged the Government in policy dialogue to improve sector performance. \nAs  a  result,  the  Government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  the  road  map  for  the  sector \n(Supplementary Appendix A), which includes Mong Duong 1 and 2. \n \n11.  ADB has approved $663.3 million in sovereign loans (Appendix 3) to develop the sector. \nThe earlier loans were for strengthening the high-voltage transmission backbone networks in \nnorthern Viet Nam; and extending and rehabilitating medium- and low-voltage substations and \ndistribution networks in the northern, central, and southern regions of the country. In addition, \nADB has supported private sector investment in power generation through its Private Sector \nOperations Department. In the past 4 years, ADB has participated in the financing of two \nsignificant gas-fired thermal power plants at Phu My. In policy dialogue with the Government, \nADB has prioritized the promotion of efficient use of energy, especially in the industrial sector. \nADB will provide technical assistance (TA) to determine the potential for accessing the carbon \nmarket through renewable energy and industrial energy efficiency projects. Further, ADB will \nassess the possibility of accessing debt financing from domestic financing institutions to address \nthese  issues  through  appropriately  designed  lending  or  guarantee  products  and  policy \ninterventions, using ADB\u2019s proposed Energy Efficiency Fund and Carbon Market Fund. \n \n12.  The Government and EVN recognize that the needs of the power sector cannot be met \nfrom domestic and public sector borrowings. Consequently, the Government initiated sector \nreforms starting in 2004 following an ADB-financed TA on power sector reforms.12 Under the \nGovernment\u2019s  proposed  sector  reforms,  the  responsibility  for  planning  and  procuring  new \n                                                 \n10  The Government signed a memorandum of understanding with a joint venture consortium in March 2006 for the \ndevelopment of the 1,000\u20131,200 MW of Mong Duong 2 thermal power plant. The Government is reviewing the \nconsortium\u2019s technical proposal and draft power purchase agreement.   \n11  ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and the Private Sector Department are also working together in developing the \nO Mon II and IV loan project (1,500 MW) as a public-private partnership project in 2008 and 2009, respectively. \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Road Map for Power Sector Reform. \nManila. \n ", "    5 \ngeneration capacity from public and private sector investors would be transferred to a \u201csingle \nbuyer.\u201d13 The main challenge here is to provide adequate comfort to potential private investors \nin the context of ongoing sector reforms, without compromising the flexibility required in power \npurchase agreements for effective functioning of the proposed power market. \n \n2.  Meeting the Rapid Growth in Power Demand \n13.  The main challenge facing the power sector is maintaining adequate investments to \nmeet the exceptionally rapid growth in electricity demand. More than 49,000 MW in additional \npower generation capacity is projected for 2006\u20132020 (Table 3), of which more than 11,000 MW \nare under construction and will be commissioned by 2012. Managing an expansion program \nthat is expected to increase the system capacity more than threefold over 10 years (2006\u20132015) \ninevitably will be a major challenge. Under the 6th PDMP, EVN will undertake about half of the \nprojected capacity additions in hydropower, coal, and natural gas. Joint ventures between state-\nowned enterprises and private sector investors, and by private sector investors without state \nparticipation, will make the remaining investments.  \n \n14.  About $23 billion in investment is required for the sector in 2006\u20132010. EVN will provide \n$14 billion (about $9 billion from internal cash generation and $5 billion in net borrowings), while \nother investors will cover the remaining $9 billion. A similar level of investment is expected for \n2011\u20132015. The availability of concessional official development assistance and domestic funds \nthrough the Government is limited. Thus, EVN increasingly is borrowing on commercial terms \nfrom export credit agencies and ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). EVN plans to raise \nfunds in international capital markets through a series of US dollar bonds during 2006\u20132010. \nEVN is already raising financing from the domestic market by issuing bonds denominated in \nVietnamese Dong.  \n \na.  Maintaining Financial Viability of the Power Sector \n15.  EVN\u2019s operations have been profitable, and it has financed the rapid expansion of the \nViet Nam\u2019s electricity sector without significant fiscal subsidies. The main financial performance \nindicators,  such  as  debt  service  cover  ratio,  self  financing  ratio,  debt-equity  ratio,  and \nreceivables, have been maintained. The average end user tariff has been maintained at $0.052 \nper kWh from 2003 to 2006. Due to EVN\u2019s increasing debt financing and financial obligations for \npower purchases from independent power producers (IPP) on a take-or-pay terms,14 sustained \ntariff increases are required to maintain adequate levels of debt service and self-financing of \nnew investments. In this context, MOI submitted to the Government a tariff increase to ensure \nEVN\u2019s  financial  performance  indicators  are  maintained.  The  Government  approved  a  tariff \nincrease of 8.8% in October 2006 and this took effect as of 1 January 2007. EVN\u2019s financial \nperformance and projection is in Appendix 2, while the projected financial statements are in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nb.  Government Power Sector Policy \n16.  The Government\u2019s policy for the power sector, as set out in the Electricity Law15 that \ncame into effect in July 2005, is, inter alia, \u201cto develop a power market on the principles of \ntransparency and competition to achieve economic efficiency, to attract investments from both \nstate and non\u2013state sectors to the sector and to ensure the legitimate rights of the consumers \nand the investors in the sector.\u201d Further, the law states that the Government monopoly in the \nsector  would  be  limited  to  power  transmission,  national  load  dispatch,  and  strategically \n                                                 \n13 An entity responsible for buying power from all the generators and selling to distribution companies and large \nconsumers will be established after 2009. \n14  An industry term meaning that EVN will to pay for the electricity generated even if it does not require it. \n15 The Electricity Law was approved on 16 November 2004 and promulgated on 1 July 2005. \n ", "6     \nimportant large power plants, leaving the power distribution and non-strategic power generation \nto potential private sector investors. The law specifically encourages investments from foreign \nprivate sector investors and joint ventures between foreign investors and domestic enterprises. \nTo achieve these objectives, MOI is responsible for establishing a competitive power market in \nthe medium term (2009\u20132012), and for procuring new generation capacity on flexible terms to \nfacilitate the transition to a competitive power market. Since the enactment of the Electricity \nLaw, the Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to creating a transparent power \nmarket and broadening the ownership of the sector by taking several key initial steps, such as \n(i) establishing the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam (October 2005), (ii) approving the \nRoad Map for Establishing Power Market, and (iii) taking legal measures to establish a new \nentity  called  the  Viet  Nam  Electricity  to  become  a  holding  company  for  the  former  EVN \nsubsidiaries (para. 19). The Government is also setting up a social fund to subsidize non-\neconomic capital expenditure for future rural electrification transparently, and to remove the \nprevailing cross-subsidies. \n  \nc.  Government Road Map for Sector Reforms  \n17.  The Road Map for Electricity Market Establishment and Development, approved by the \nPrime Minister, envisages a phased approach to sector reforms. During the first phase of the \npower market\u2019s development, the competition will be only among the power plants. A pilot \ninternal power market limited to EVN power plants was initiated in January 2007. Beginning in \n2009, a single buyer will act as an intermediary between the power plants and distribution \ncompanies. The single buyer will sell electricity to distribution companies and large consumers \nat regulated prices. The next phase of the power market development will entail the wholesale \ncompetitive market, where sellers (power plants) and buyers (distribution companies and large \nconsumers) will compete in a power pool. The final stage will be retail competition, which will \nallow  retail  consumers  to  choose  their  supplier.  An  important  issue  is  the  degree  of \nindependence of the single buyer and the system operator from the rest of EVN, which could \ncontinue to own and control a significant stake in partially corporatized power plants during the \nearly stage of reform. This will require transparent rules for market operation, for dispatching of \npower plants, and for settlement, as well as appropriate regulatory oversight. The ongoing ADB \nTA to the Electricity Regulator16 will address these strategic issues. \n \nd.  Regulation of the Electricity Sector \n18.  The main functions of the electricity regulator are to (i) issue licenses to sector entities, \nand to enforce the license conditions; (ii) advise the minister on market structure and industry \nrestructuring policy; (iii) establish the tariff-setting principals, including transfer pricing between \nsector  entities;  (iv)  develop  tariffs  for  regulated  activities;  (v)  approve  power  purchase \nagreements of the single buyer (EVN or a new entity to be establish after 2009); (vi) ensure the \nprocurement  of  adequate  new  generation  and  transmission  capacity;  (vii)  monitor  the \nimplementation progress of new generation and transmission projects; and (viii) monitor the \nfunctioning of power market. The regulator\u2019s role also involves ensuring proper performance of \nkey market institutions, such as the single buyer, the system operator, and the transmission \ncompany, in providing equal opportunities to the power plants taking part in the power market. \nADB, together with Agence Fran\u00e7aise De D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and the World Bank, are \nassisting MOI in developing instruments, such as transparent rules for market operation and \ndispatch of power plants and settlements, as well as appropriate regulatory oversight that would \naddress the concerns of the private sector.  \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Power Market Design. Manila. (TA \n4768-VIE, approved on 1 March, for $500,000). \n ", "    7 \ne.  Corporate Restructuring of EVN  \n19.  The Government has taken steps to restructure the electricity industry by establishing \nViet Nam Electricity (EVN) based on a holding company structure to replace the vertically \nintegrated  EVN  in  October  2006.  The  Government  approved  the  equitization  (partial \nprivatization) plan for 2007-2008 in April 2007 for equitizing most of the operating units engaged \nin power generation and distribution. All the existing power plants except the three multipurpose \nhydropower plants (Hoa Binh, Yaly, and Tri An) and the 9 regional power distribution companies \nwill be equitized during 2007-2008. The thermal power complexes and hydropower plants that \nare  of  cascade  in  nature  will  be  grouped  into  individual  companies  for  the  purpose  of \nequitization. Prior to the approval of this equitization plan in April 2007, two thermal power \nplants, one hydropower plant and a provincial power distribution company were equitized in \n2006. The power transmission system and the load dispatch centre will be a wholly owned \nsubsidiary  of  EVN.  The  non-core  business  of  EVN,  such  as  EVN  Telecom,  consulting \ncompanies, manufacturing companies, and others, likewise will be equitized during the same \nperiod. The project management boards responsible for managing EVN projects will become \nindependent subsidiaries. They will be required to compete for management of EVN-sponsored \nprojects, and will be free to undertake power projects of other investors.  \n   \nf.  Environmental and Social Issues  \n20.  The rapid expansion of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector will result in significant environmental \nand  social  externalities.  The  addition  of  more  than  10,000  MW  of  new  power  generation \ncapacity  based  on  coal  over  the  next  5-8  years  will  increase  greenhouse  gas  emissions. \nHowever, the current level of per capita greenhouse gas emissions in Viet Nam is among the \nlowest in the world.17 Viet Nam is a signatory18 to the Kyoto Protocol,19 which aims to reduce \ngreenhouse  gas  (including  carbon  dioxide  [CO ])  emissions  to  the  atmosphere.  The \n2\nGovernment has strengthened its approval process for environment impact assessments (EIA) \nthrough the new Environmental Law that took effect on 1 July 2006. Provincial authorities \nrecently have been assigned more authority over the implementation of resettlement plans and \ncompensation arrangements for land acquisition for project-affected people, and improvements \nhave been reported. In this context, the Project will comply with the stringent environmental \nmitigations measures required under the law and will have state of the art environmental air \npollution control equipment installed. \n \n3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n21.  A major portion of external assistance to Viet Nam\u2019s power sector has come from ADB, \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency (Sida), and the World Bank. JBIC has provided assistance for thermal \npower plants (gas and coal), hydropower plants, and 500 kV transmission lines. The World \nBank has provided loans for generation, transmission, and distribution networks. It also has \nprovided TA in (i) power sector policy and strategy, (ii) institutional strengthening, (iii) demand-\nside management, (iv) renewable energy, (v) BOT law, and (vi) development of the Electricity \nLaw. Sida has supported preparation of a hydropower development master plan and financing \nof a hydropower project. Other bilateral sources of assistance to the power sector include \n                                                 \n17 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2005 shows that Viet Nam emits 0.3 tons \nCO /capita, compared to 6.3 tons CO /capita by Japan, 8.8 tons CO /capita by United Kingdom, and 20.6 tons CO  \n2 2 2 2\nper capita by the USA. \n18 Viet Nam signed the treaty on 3 December 1998 and ratified it on 25 September 2002. Enforcement started \n16 February 2005. \n19 The Kyoto Protocol set specific targets for reductions in greenhouse gas concentrations in the global atmosphere. \nEmission restrictions were made for the rich countries, the biggest greenhouse gas producers but also the \ncountries most able to cut emissions.    \n ", "8     \nCanada, People\u2019s Republic of China, France, Germany, Norway, and United Kingdom. The list \nof ADB-financed TA and assistance by development partners is in Appendix 3. \n4.  Lessons  \n22.  While procurement, resettlement, and compensation were delayed some under earlier \nloans that have been closed, overall implementation was found to be satisfactory. The main \nlessons from these loans were the need to ensure that (i) technical designs are completed \nbefore equipment and material is procured to match design requirements; (ii) adequate capacity \nis built into the power management board (implementing agency) in regard to ADB\u2019s policies in \nconsulting services and procurement; (iii) procurement approval is delegated to the project \nmanagement board; (iv) the process for bid document approval and contract award applicable \nto ADB-financed contracts under the loan is clarified at the outset; (v) a satisfactory resettlement \nplan  and  framework  is  in  place  before  loan  approval;  and  (vi)  specific  environmental \nrequirements,  including  documentation  and  reporting,  are  included  in  loan  covenants  and \nbidding documents. The Government\u2019s approval process, particularly for procurement, remains \ntime-consuming and has led to project implementation delays. Therefore, the proposed Project \nhas provided for appropriate advance procurement action and the Government has delegated \nthe approval of project procurement to EVN to expedite implementation. EVN Management \napproved  the  procurement  plan  in  June  2007  and  submitted  it  to  ADB  for  review  and \nendorsement. ADB approval to the proposed procurement plan was given on 12 July 2007. \nMoreover, day to day project management responsibilities have been reassigned from EVN to a \nproject implementation unit\u2014the Thermal Power Project Management Unit 1 (TPPMU 1)\u2014to \nensure  smooth  implementation.  As  this  agency  is  a  dependent  unit  of  EVN,  which  is  the \nExecuting Agency for the Project, EVN will also monitor and oversee project implementation.  \n \n23.  The lessons from the implementation of previous projects have been incorporated into \nthe project design, and measures put in place to strengthen the Implementing Agency. In \naddition, experience from past coal power plants financed by ADB was taken into consideration. \nThese include (i) ensuring stack height is sufficient for air dispersion; (ii) using clean coal \ntechnology for the boiler; (iii) installing flue gas desulphurization equipment, selective catalytic \nreduction of nitrogen oxide, and electrostatic precipitators; (iv) disposing of ash properly; (v) \nensuring the air quality monitoring component is adequate; and (v) optimizing positive impacts \non people\u2019s livelihood, and designing appropriate livelihood development programs. In this \ncontext,  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  management  plans  (EMP)  were  strengthened  and \nmitigation measures developed. \n \n24.  Earlier ADB TAs (attached to loans) concentrated on (i) providing capacity building to the \npower sector, specifically to financial management of EVN\u2019s distribution units; (ii) providing cost-\nbased electricity tariff-setting; (iii) commercialization of distribution companies; and (iv) setting \nup a power sector regulatory framework. As a result, the corporate governance of the sector has \nimproved. A TA on power market design (footnote 16) is assisting the Government in making \nstrategic decisions regarding the (i) market structure; (ii) role of EVN and its subsidiaries, and \nthe  relationship  among  them;  (iii)  nature  of  the  regulatory  regime  and  key  regulatory \nmechanisms; and (iv) the terms of power purchase arrangements for new and equitized power \nplants.  A  TA  is  being  prepared  for  approval  in  2007  to  strengthen  EVN\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement capacity and the provincial environment office capacity (para. 36) in Mong Duong. \n \n5.  Capacity Building \n25.  The Project is one of the largest undertaken by TPPMU1. The project implementation \nunit was established and staffed by TPPMU1 in May 2006. TPPMU1 is competent to implement \nthe Project. Capacity building will be provided under the Project to train TPPMU1 staff on the \napplication of ADB policies for procurement of goods and services, invoicing and payments to \n ", "    9 \ncontractors, and project management. Capacity building on circulatory fluidized bed (CFB) boiler \ntechnology  will  be  provided  under  the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC) \ncontract package, and by the implementation consultants. The Project provides for adequate \ninternational implementation consulting services for the design, procurement, implementation, \nand capacity building phases of the Project, with participation of TPPMU1 and EVN at all stages \nof implementation. Suppliers will also be required to provide adequate capacity building for \nTPPMU1  and  EVN  staff,  and  to  transfer  CFB  boiler  operational  technology  during \nimplementation of the contracts.  \n \n26.  As part of implementing the EMP for the Project, institutional strengthening activities \nwithin EVN and TPPMU1 will be carried out. Training for key EVN staff on environmental \nmanagement,  contractor  management  in  relation  to  environmental  issues,  and  public \ninvolvement processes will be provided. A full-time environmental officer will be engaged within \nTPPMU1 to act as the overall coordinator of environmental management activities associated \nwith the Project. An ADB consultant will provide training for this officer, as required, based on a \ntraining needs assessment. In addition, key TPPMU1 staff will be provided with training in \nenvironmental management and contract management.   \n \n6.  Public-Private Sector Development Strategy \n27.  The Government is committed to increasing private investment in the power sector as \npart of a broader strategy to meet the nation\u2019s rapidly growing demand for electricity. The \nGovernment has taken extensive measures within the past 5 years to use private capital to \ncomplement Government-led investments in a broad public-private partnership. This began with \nthe  ADB-assisted  private  sector  participation in  the  Phu  My  power  complex,  and  is  being \nfollowed through in the Mong Duong thermal power complex. In addition, ADB is currently \nassisting EVN in developing a gas power plant for private sector financing in southern Viet Nam. \nFurthermore,  the  Government  has  identified  power  generation  projects  where  state-owned \nenterprises, such as Petro Viet Nam, Vinacomin, and Lilama are developing these projects, with \nEVN purchasing the power based on negotiated power purchase agreements. Under these \narrangements, the relevant state enterprise may seek financing from private sector sources on \nthe understanding that such financing will be substantially on a non-recourse basis, subject to \nproject risks, and mitigated only in exceptional cases by Government guarantees. Recently, \nMOI provided a mandate to the International Finance Corporation to assist the Government in \ndeveloping an IPP framework that will support public private partnerships in power generation \nprojects in a sustainable manner. The mandate calls for developing a BOT framework that \nwould  support  the  development  of  IPPs  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  annual  $3  billion  power \ninvestment program. In 2006, EVN purchased about 14% of its power requirements from the \nprivate sector, and this figure is expected to reach 33% by 2010. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n28.  The Project comprises the construction of the 1,000 MW Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power \nPlant, the power complex that will have an installed generating capacity of 2,000 MW or 2,200 \nMW upon completion, depending on the boiler technology selected for the second phase. The \nProject will (i) provide an adequate and reliable power supply to meet part of Viet Nam\u2019s rapidly \ngrowing electricity demand in an environmentally sustainable manner; (ii) help increase the \nshare of thermal power generation capacity in Viet Nam, thereby correcting the current dry \nseason imbalance of hydropower plants; and (iii) facilitate, through the inclusion of common \nfacilities to be shared by the Mong Duong 1 and 2 thermal power projects, the construction of \nMong Duong 2 by a private sector developer under a BOT arrangement. The Project will provide \nfor appropriate capacity building in number of areas, and incorporate all necessary environment \nand social safeguards.  \n \n ", "10    \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n29.  The impact of the proposed Project will be to (i) meet electricity demand growth and \nensure power system reliability to sustain economic growth in northern Viet Nam; (ii) diversify \nfuel generation sources by increasing the thermal generation capacity, and gradually reducing \nthe current the imbalance of hydropower plants in the power system by 2020; and (iii) facilitate \nprivate sector participation in the second phase (Mong Duong 2) of the Project. The immediate \noutcome of the Project will be that households, small business, industries, and rural consumers \nin  northern  Viet  Nam  will  have  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity  and  more  opportunities  for \neconomic development. \n \nB.  Outputs \n30.  The project site is in Mong Duong ward, Cam Pha district, Quang Ninh Province, about \n300 km northeast of Hanoi. The 107-hectare (ha) site is sufficient to support a power complex \nwith a capacity of 2,200 MW. The site is close to a major source of coal, has access to the sea \nfor cooling water, and good transport links for fuel and materials. The Project is scheduled for \ncommissioning in 2013. The construction of Mong Duong 1 power plant and the associated \ncommon facilities will support the development of Mong Duong 2 by the private sector.  \n \nC.  Technical Justification  \n31.  Available  clean  coal  technologies  evaluated  for  the  Project  include  conventional \npulverized coal-fueled boilers, super critical boilers (operating at much higher temperatures and \npressures),  integrated  coal  gasification  combined  cycle  units,  and  CFB  boilers.  The  TA \nconsultants found the CFB technology to be optimal for the following reasons: \n(i)  Pulverized coal-fueled boilers require sulfur and nitrous dioxide cleaning equipment \n(not necessary for CFB technology) that would be more expensive in capital cost and \noperations for the type of coal to be used.  \n(ii)  Although super critical boiler technology is well-established, it requires high-quality \nand costly manufacturing technology, and is not suitable for the relatively poor-\nquality domestic anthracite available. It is more suited for countries with a much \nhigher cost of delivered coal, and an established advanced industrial technology \nbase to support it during plant operation and maintenance. \n(iii)  Integrated  coal  gasification  combined  cycle  technology  is  still  largely  in  the \ndevelopment stage, and the first commercial plants are generally at the prototype \nstage. \n \n32.  Based  on  this  assessment,  unit  size  of  250  MW  CFB  boilers, 20  matched  with \nconventional 500 MW turbo-generators, were found optimally suited to burn the generally poor-\nquality  and  expected  variability  of  fuel  (blended  coal  mixture)  available  for  the  Project. \nWorldwide, CFB technology is still evolving for boiler sizes above 250 MW. As the long-term \nreliability of the 250 MW boilers has been established, this boiler size is being considered for the \nProject. Thus, the Project requires four 250 MW CFB boilers and two 500 MW turbines. To \nsatisfy  permissible  national  air  emission  limits,21 the  CFB  boilers  will  be  equipped  with \nelectrostatic precipitators to limit particulate emission. Moreover, sulfur dioxide emissions will be \nlimited by injecting limestone into the boiler during combustion, and nitrous oxide emissions will \n                                                 \n20 Actual unit sizes will depend on bids received and may vary from 250 MW to 300 MW.  \n21 Viet Nam\u2019s standard for air emissions is more stringent than the World Bank standard for sulfur dioxide (SO ) and \n2\nnitrous oxide (NO). World Bank standard for SO  are 2,000 milligrams/normal cubic meters (mg/Nm3) and NO at \nx 2 x\n1,500 mg/Nm3. Viet Nam\u2019s requirements for SO are at 350 mg/Nm3, NO 700 mg/Nm3, and particulates at 140 \n2  x\nmg/Nm3 for an industrial zone; SO at 280 mg/Nm3, NO at 560 mg/Nm3, and particulates at 112 mg/Nm3 for an \n2  x\nurban zone. \n ", "    11 \nbe  reduced  due  to  the  low  combustion  temperature  of  a  CFB  boiler  and  the  flue  gas \nrecirculation techniques employed during combustion. This technology eliminates the need for \nexternal sulfur and nitrous oxide removal equipment, which is expensive in terms of capital cost \nand operational cost, and presents waste product disposal difficulties. \nD.  Special Features \n33.  EVN will use new but proven CFB technology, which enables the efficient use of poor-\nquality and waste coal by blending it with better coal. If not used, the waste coal will be burned \ninefficiently on a small scale with fewer environmental mitigation measures, or it will remain \naround the coal mines contributing to atmospheric dust and environmental pollution. \n \n34.  The Project will catalyze private sector participation by (i) supporting site preparation and \ndevelopment of common facilities required by the next phase of Mong Duong expansion; (ii) \nproviding for a common EIA, together with mitigation measures and a costed EMP (including \ncosts of the private sector); (iii) preparing the resettlement plan for the whole power complex, \nplus the monitoring of its implementation; and (iv) addressing capacity building of EVN in \nenvironment, resettlement, and CFB technology. With these services included in the Project\u2019s \nscope, the programming and private sector financing of Mong Duong 2 might be accelerated, \nand certain risk premiums avoided (e.g., environment and resettlement risks). The Government \nand EVN have recognized that the risk should be borne by the party most capable of controlling \nsuch  risks.  Thus,  the  Project  has  a  synergistic  application  of  facilitating  the  public-private \npartnership.  \n \n35.  The construction of the Project will affect 41 ha of mangrove. To offset the expected loss \nof mangrove ecosystems, a mangrove management and monitoring plan has been prepared \nand included in the EIA. The key elements of the plan are described in Appendix 4. About \n300,000 tons per year of ash, which has good cementatious properties, will be sold to cement \nindustries, and for use in making roller-compacted concrete for various applications (notably for \nhydropower weirs, etc.), once the plant becomes operational. \n \n36.  Capacity Building of EVN, TPPMU1, and Quang Ninh Department of Natural Resources \nwill be undertaken to strengthen their institutional capacity in environment management. ADB \nwill provide TA22 in 2007 that will strengthen Quang Ninh\u2019s Department of Natural Resources to \nenable it to monitor (a) air quality in project area during construction  and operational phase; \nand (b) operations at the coal mines in the province adequately, and to ensure that their \nenvironmental mitigation measures are implemented effectively. Capacity building in mangrove \nreplanting and monitoring activities will also be provided to personnel of Bai Tu Long National \nPark.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n37.  The Project is estimated to cost $1,099.60 million. The summary cost estimates of the \nProject are in Table 4, while the detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. Detailed project \ncosts and financing plan are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n                                                 \n22 TA to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Capacity Building on Environmental Management in the Power Sector \nfor $600,000 has been programmed in the 2006 CSP for 2007.  \n ", "12    \nTable 4: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n \n  Item  Amounts \nA.

The Government is seeking financing up to the equivalent of $930.71 million from ADB\u2019s \nOCR to help finance the Project\u2019s investment cost. Further, the Government has requested that \nfinancing be provided in two loans under ADB\u2019s MFF, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Pilot Financing \nInstruments and Modalities23 approved in August 2005. The Government\u2019s preferred this mode \nof financing for the Project, rather than adopting a traditional project loan approach, largely due \nto (i) the loan being almost $1 billion, when only $27.86 million is needed for preconstruction \nworks in the first 2 years; (ii) the need for sufficient time (about 20 months) to (a) finalize \ndetailed designs for the Project, (b) prepare bidding documents, (c) undertake international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) following ADB guidelines, (d) negotiate with the highest-ranked EPC \ncontractor,  and  (e)  award  the  main  EPC  contract  to  the  selected  contractor;  and  (iii) \napprehension that bids for the EPC contract could escalate unless the bidding community sees \nthat financing is firmly in place beforehand. The Government, therefore, decided on two loans\u2014\nthe first loan will be provided for the site preparation works, while the second will be extended \nwhen the EPC contractor has been selected and the contract is ready to be awarded. \n \n39.  The  Government  has  confirmed  its  intention  to  enter  into  a  framework  financing \nagreement (FFA) with ADB in the form presented to the Board. The FFA in this form satisfies \nthe requirements set forth in Appendix 4 of ADB\u2019s Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities \n(footnote  23).  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  the  first  periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) for a loan of $27.86 million from OCR. The form of this PFR is also \npresented to the Board of Directors with the FFA. All of the provisions of the ordinary operations \nloan regulations applicable to London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans24 will apply \nto each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included under any loan agreement. \n \n40.  The Government can choose from eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for \neach loan. The specific terms of each loan will be set out in the applicable loan agreement and \nbased on the related PFR, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2005. Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities.

First Loan  \n \n41.  The  first  loan  under  the  MFF,  for  $27.86  million,  is  submitted  herewith  for  Board \nconsideration. The detailed description and cost estimates of this loan from ADB\u2019s OCR are in \nAppendix 6 (Table A6.1). The loan will finance site preparation civil works and consulting \nservices for the first phase of the Project. The scope of the civil works will include (i) site \nclearing and leveling, (ii) construction of the river diversion channel, (iii) construction of access \nroads, (iv) construction of a transmission line for power supply during construction, (v) provision \nof water supply during construction, (vi) office for project management staff and consultants, \nand (vii) construction of quarters for project management staff and consultants.  \n \n42.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  finance  a  first  loan  of  $27.86  million  (63.3%) \ntowards the cost of the pre-construction phase. Meanwhile, EVN will provide local currency \nequivalent  to  $16.15  million  (36.7%)  for  (i)  local  project  management,  (ii)  preparation  of \ntechnical designs and bid documents, (iii) taxes and duties, (iv) resettlement compensation, (v) \nimplementation of the resettlement and environment plans, and (vi) hydrological surveys. The \nterms of reference for the consulting services have been finalized, and ADB Management has \napproved advance recruitment. EVN has prepared a long list of consulting firms who have \nsubmitted expressions of interest, and will complete the shortlist in June 2007 and issue the \nrequest for proposal in July 2007. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and \nthe proceeds of each OCR loan will be onlent to EVN pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement \nwith terms and conditions acceptable to ADB \n \nb.  Second Loan \n43.  Approval  of  a  second  loan  for  $902.85  million  is  expected  when  procurement \nprocedures and contract negotiations for the EPC contract are completed substantially, which is \nanticipated in the third quarter of 2009. The second loan will finance primarily the remaining civil \nworks, the EPC contract (estimated at $744.13 million), and the second phase of consulting \nservices for the construction supervision of the EPC contractor and the civil works contracts. \nThe scope of the remaining civil works will include construction of common facilities for the \nProject and Mong Duong 2 (the BOT component) such as: (i) fuel oil and limestone jetties, (ii) \nsite boundary and drainage, (iii) electrical system for start up, (iv) cooling water discharge \nchannel beyond the outfall, (v) cooling water inlet and outlet channels, (vi) fresh water supply \nsystem during operation of the plant, and (vii) first ash pond. \n \n44.

The  scope  of  work  of  the  consulting  services  includes  supervision  of  the  EPC \ncontractor, as well as the remaining civil works contracts. The consultants will also provide \ntraining  to  TPPMU1  staff  in  project  financial  management,  contract  management,  CFB \ntechnology, and operation and maintenance. ADB will finance $9032.85 million (85.5%) of the \nsecond  tranche,  while EVN  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $152.74  million  (14.5%)  in  local \ncurrency as counterpart financing for the owner\u2019s project management, taxes and duties, and \ncontingency. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and the proceeds of the \nOCR loan will be onlent to EVN pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement, with terms and \nconditions acceptable to ADB. The detailed description and cost of this second OCR loan is in \nAppendix 6 (Table A6.2). \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n46.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be EVN. The Implementing Agency will be \nTPPMU1, which has established an adequately staffed project management unit (PMU) with \nproject offices initially at the Hanoi headquarters. The PMU subsequently will set up an office at \nthe  project  site.  The  implementation  consultants,  therefore,  will  comprise  of  international \nconsultants in association with qualified national consultants. The consultants will assist the \nPMU with EPC procurement and project management, environment management planning, and \nimplementation of resettlement plans. EVN will engage suitable national consultants to assist \nwith EVN-funded procurement and project management. In general, EVN and TPPMU1 are \nconsidered competent bodies to administer the proposed Project. A detailed assessment of \nEVN and TPPMU 1 is in Appendix 7, and in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, including procurement and construction \nactivities, and is scheduled to be completed by July 2013. The first loan will have a utilization \nperiod of 6 years, while the second loan will have a utilization period of 4 years. The Project has \nbeen appraised fully, and the first loan is ready for disbursement and implementation soon after \nBoard approval. The implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n48.  Equipment and materials to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be \nincorporated in bidding documents for all ADB-financed contracts. ICB will be used for (i) civil \nworks with an estimated value of $3 million and above, (ii) turnkey contracts, and (iii) supply \ncontracts estimated to cost at least $1 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used \nfor civil works contracts estimated at below $3 million. NCB procedures or limited international \nbidding will be used for supply contracts estimated at $100,000 to $1 million. Procurement of \nmiscellaneous goods and civil works contracts valued at less than $100,000 will be procured \nusing  shopping  procedures.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  maximum \n ", "    15 \ncompetition under ICB. The proposed ADB-financed contract packages and the procurement \nplan are in Appendix 9.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  Consulting  services  will  be  procured  in  two  packages,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, with a separate recruitment exercise for services under \neach of the two loans. Consulting inputs will total 820 person-months, comprising 556 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  264  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices. The quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method will be adopted. To expedite \nimplementation, EVN has commenced preparation of detailed designs and tender documents \nfor all the main packages, including preparation of draft tender documents and other supporting \ndocumentation for all other packages. The international consultants primarily will review the \nwork completed so far, and update and finalize detailed designs and tender documents. They \nwill assist throughout the bidding process, including contract negotiations and awarding of the \nEPC contract, and supervise the implementation of each loan. A brief summary of the scope of \nwork of the consultants under each loan is given in paragraphs 51and 52, and described in \nmore detail in Supplementary Appendix E. ADB Management approved advance action for \nrecruitment of consultants in August 2006, and EVN is finalizing the long list of consulting firms \nand terms of reference. \n \n50.  The scope of consulting services under the first loan includes (i) reviewing technical \ndesigns, drawings and prepared by EVN, and revising these designs, if necessary; (ii) preparing \nbid  documents  for  selection  of  the  EPC  contractor  for  Mong  Duong  1;  (iii)  reviewing  and \nupdating the bid documents for the civil works contracts; (iv) assisting EVN in all contract \nnegotiations and contract awards, including the EPC contract; (v) supervising implementation of \ncivil  works  under  the  first  loan;  (vii)  assisting  TPPMU1  in  implementing  the  EMP  and \nresettlement plan; (viii) assisting EVN in the selection of consultants for the second loan of the \nProject; (ix) guiding and supervising resettlement committees, and training staff of TPPMU1, \nand various environmental and resettlement committees; and (x) guiding the implementation the \ngender strategy. \n \n51.  The scope of consulting services for the second loan primarily will cover overall project \nmanagement  and  supervision  of  the  EPC  contract,  including  construction  supervision; \ngenerating plant commissioning and commercial acceptance testing and warranties; supervision \nof  civil  works  contracts;  and  continued  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and \nresettlement plan. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, EVN, and TPPMU1. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include the provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of EVN, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n53.  Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for \nbidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the \nprocurement  and  execution  of  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are \n ", "16    \ndiscovered.  Based  on  Government  policy  and  experience  in  fighting  corruption,  EVN\u2019s \ninspectorate  department  will  take  necessary  action  to  prevent  corruption  by  (i)  closely \nsupervising the bidding processes, bid evaluation, and construction; (ii) preventing interference \nin the bidding and evaluation process; and (iii) briefing TPPMU1 and the related Government \nauthorities, including the local prosecutor\u2019s office, when an incident of corruption has been \ndetected. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements and Advance Contracting \n54.  The proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines on loan disbursements, 25 as amended from time to time. The Government \nand EVN have been informed that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  EVN will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within 6 months of the close of \neach financial year, EVN will submit to ADB annual audited project accounts and annual audited \nfinancial statements. The annual financial statements will be consolidated for all of EVN\u2019s \noperations. The financial management systems and procedures of EVN have been assessed \nand found to meet ADB\u2019s requirements.  \n \n56.  EVN  will  continue  to  engage  independent  auditors  to  audit  its  annual  financial \nstatements and annual project accounts, with a memorandum on issues identified during the \nprocess to be submitted with the respective reports. As part of the harmonization of procedures \nof external funding agencies, EVN and the World Bank have agreed on the standards to be \nfollowed in auditing and preparation of financial statements. The auditors\u2019 terms of reference will \nbe  provided  to  ADB  for  review.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be  prepared  using \nInternational Accounting Standards, and the annual audits will be carried out using International \nStandards of Auditing. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on EVN\u2019s compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s financial covenants set out in each of the loan agreements, and indicate the details \nof the calculation for financial ratios in the covenants, in conformity with the definitions contained \nin the Loan and Project Agreement. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  TPPMU1 will prepare progress reports and submit them to ADB quarterly. The reports \nwill provide a narrative of (i) progress during the quarter, (ii) changes in the implementation \nschedule,  (iii)  problems  encountered,  (iv)  performance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, and (v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also \ninclude a summary of financial accounts of project expenditures during each quarter to date, \nand expenditures to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project \nbased on these reports. Further, ADB will meet with EVN, TPPMU1, and the Government \nsemiannually to discuss project progress. TPPMU1 will monitor the performance, which will be \nevaluated  based  on  the  performance  indicators  or  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework. \n \n9.  Project Review \n58.  ADB will field an Inception Mission soon after approval of the investment project. ADB \nwill  review  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  and  EMPs,  as  well  as  the  project \ncomponents, based on the quarterly reports. ADB will also meet with EVN, TPPMU1, and the \n                                                 \n25  ADB. 2001. Asian Development Bank Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila; and ADB. 2002. Interim Guideline for \nDisbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products. Manila.  \n ", "    17 \nGovernment semiannually to discuss project progress. A midterm review will be carried out 3 \nyears after loan effectiveness. Representatives of ADB and EVN will take part in the review, \nenabling the midcourse corrections necessary to ensure successful project implementation and \nachievement of objectives. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months \nof  project  completion.  Finally,  staff  will  provide  to  ADB  Board  and  Management  a  yearly \nimplementation  progress  report  by  first  week  of  December  each  year  until  the  Project  is \ncompleted. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n59.  The Project is included in the Government's 5th and 6th PDMP. The long-term system \noptimization under the 6th PDMP confirms that the Project is part of the least-cost schedule of \ncapacity addition to meet the growing electricity demand of the country. Detailed economic and \nfinancial  analyses,  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n60.  The economic viability of the Project was examined based on incremental costs incurred \nand benefits accrued to the society. This analysis was conducted by comparing the societal \ncosts and benefits of the \"with Project\" scenario against the \"without Project\" scenario. All costs \nand benefits were evaluated based on a domestic price numeraire. EVN estimated the Project's \ncosts, which ADB staff checked and verified. Staff made adjustments to bring these estimated \ncosts to include social costs by applying shadow exchange rate factor (SERF).26 \n \n61.  The costs to the society are the investment and operating costs of the Project, as well as \nthe environmental mitigating costs. Investment costs, in turn, consist of (i) equipment costs; (ii) \nconstruction costs; and (iii) engineering, administrative, and management costs of power plant \nconstruction. Fuel (coal and limestone) and related costs account for a significant part of the \noperating costs. While the total cost takes into account physical contingencies, it excludes \ninterest during the construction and price contingencies.  \n \n62.  The economic value of electricity generated by the Project is measured by using the \ncosts  to  the  society  of  not  having  the  Project  (the  so-called  avoided  costs).  These  costs \ncomprise  the  costs  of  suboptimal  operation  of  thermal  power  plants  to  partially  offset  the \nshortage  of  electricity  resulting  from  not  having  the  Project,  and  the  costs  to  consumers \n(industrial, residential, commercial, and rural) due to no electricity. In other words, the societal \nbenefits of the Project is the sum of two components: the non-incremental benefits accrued \nthrough  savings  by  not  having  to  run  other  thermal  power  plants  suboptimally;  and  the \nincremental benefits accrued to the consumers by having sufficient supply of electricity to meet \ntheir needs, thus avoiding load shedding27 and associated economic losses. \n \n63.  A detailed analysis (Appendix 10) demonstrates that the demand for electricity will grow \nquickly between 2005 and 2025, particularly in the northern region where the Project is to be \nconstructed. The analysis also confirms that the Project, which is scheduled to be added to the \ngrid in 2011, is part of a rigorously planned schedule of capacity additions to the power system \nduring 2006\u20132025. Economic valuation of costs and benefits of the Project, with extensive \nsensitivity analysis, has confirmed the economic robustness of the Mong Duong power complex. \nThe Project yields an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 22.5% and corresponding net \npresent  value  (NPV)  of  $846.6  million  over  its  economic  life  of  30  years  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). \n                                                 \n26  SERF = 1.1 for Viet Nam. \n27  Load shedding means cutting power to certain areas or to sectors due to not able to service the demand.  \n ", "18    \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n64.  An  additional  analysis  was  carried  out  to  examine  the  possible  impacts  of  a  large \ninvestment such as this Project on the country\u2019s debt sustainability and other macroeconomic \nindicators. The analysis was based on an ADB OCR assessment paper, draft 2007\u20132010 CSP, \nand the calculation of foreign exchange flow of the Project. This analysis showed that the \nproject investment does not alter the debt sustainability of the country in the medium to long \nterm, because the disbursement of the loan is within the OCR limit. Since more than 70% of the \nADB loan will be awarded under an EPC contract, the Project will not have significant effects on \nsupply or consumer sectors, and does not suggest excessive inflation. Further, the Project will \ngenerate sufficient revenue to repay its associated loans. The financial evaluation of the Project \nwas undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 prices. The project cost estimates and \nfinancial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting the projected \neffects of foreign and domestic inflation, and currency fluctuations. The energy generated by the \nProject was conservatively valued at $0.041 per kWh, based on the price paid by EVN to IPPs. \nThe  cost  estimates  in  Appendix  5  are  used  for  the  financial  analysis,  excluding  price \ncontingencies and interest during construction. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), \ncomputed after tax, is 6.59%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC), also computed after tax, of 2.85%. The Project is considered financially viable and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates the FIRR remains robust under adverse conditions. \nThe detailed financial analysis is in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Impacts \n65.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. A full resettlement plan, covering the plant site, \nash pond, discharge channel, and workers\u2019 site, has been prepared in accordance with the legal \nframework of Viet Nam and ADB\u2019s policies. The resettlement plan has been disclosed to the \npeople affected by the Project. Land acquisition requirements have been minimized by selecting \na project site at the mouth of the Mong Duong River. The area is used for coal transport and \nstorage; and has been heavily modified from its natural state with earthmoving, areas of fill, and \nchanges to waterway and hydrological conditions. The project area is generally hilly with some \ntree  plantations.  Based  on  the  preliminary  design,  about  148  ha  of  land  will  be  acquired \npermanently. Most of the affected land is degraded forest land (83 ha), fish ponds (41 ha), and \nindustrial land (24 ha). \n \n66.  Khe Guia Lake, about 10 km from the project site, initially was to provide fresh water \nsupply to the Project. Late in project preparation, however, the Quang Ning People\u2019s Committee \ndecided that fresh water supply for the Project will be sourced from the Thac Thay River. A \nsmall reservoir will have to be built to provide fresh water during plant operation. Due to the late \ndecision of the provincial authorities, EVN had difficulty preparing a detail resettlement plan, as \nwell as determining the line route of the water pipeline. In addition, this will have to be agreed \nwith the provincial authorities. ADB, after a due diligence assessment of the proposed site, \ndetermined that no one lived in the area because it was hilly. A few people cut trees in the area \nto supply timber as props for the coal mines, and as sleepers for the railway. In accordance with \nan agreement with EVN, a full resettlement plan based on the framework will be prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix G) for the reservoir, if necessary, and disclosed before approval of \nthe second loan.  \n \n67.  The  objective  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  avoided  or \nminimized. If involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, the plan is to provide compensation, \nassistance, and socioeconomic support programs to ensure that the people affected by the \nProject will be able to restore or improve their socioeconomic status. Resettlement impacts will \ncomprise the following: (i) 37 households will be affected, of which 32 will be required to \n ", "    19 \nrelocate;  (ii)  eight  coal  transportation  companies  and  one  tree  plantation  company  will  be \nrequired to move; (iii) one construction company will be partially affected; (iv) land of four farm \nowners (timber, fishpond, and fruit trees) will be acquired; and (v) employees of farm owners \n(80) and companies (306) might lose their jobs temporarily during the transition period when the \ncompanies  reorganize  their  activities.  The  Project  also  might  affect  fisherfolk  as  the  EIA \npredicted a possible loss of revenue from fishing and aquaculture during construction of the \nplant. A suitable compensation plan has been prepared and included in the resettlement plan, \nwhich will be updated during detailed design and disclosed to project-affected persons. The \ncompensation payments will be adjusted upwards, if necessary. The summary resettlement plan \nis in Appendix 12, while the full resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix H. A public \ninformation booklet (Annex 8 to Supplementary Appendix H) also was prepared and disclosed \nto the people affected by the Project.  \n \n68.  Environment. The Mong Duong complex has been classified as a Category A project in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  (OM)  and  Bank  Policies  (BP)  FI/BP: \nEnvironmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Further, an EIA has been prepared for the \nproject to meet the requirements of the ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \nThe EIA describes the environmental baseline conditions in the project area, and records the \nresults  of  a  comprehensive  examination  of  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Project  on  the \nsurrounding  natural  and  socioeconomic  environment.  A  one-time  air  quality  sampling  and \nanalysis at five locations showed that concentrations of total suspended particulate exceeded \nnational air quality standards. As the limited sampling results cannot be used to determine the \nstatus of air quality in an airshed, additional monitoring will be done during construction, in \naccordance with the World Bank\u2019s Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines. A core part of \nthe EIA is an EMP, which documents the environmental mitigation and monitoring activities that \nwill be implemented throughout preconstruction, construction, and operation of the Project. The \nEMP contains a discussion of the institutional arrangements that will apply to its implementation, \nand the institutional strengthening activities that will be undertaken to ensure agencies involved \nin implementation have adequate resources to fulfill their obligations under the plan. The EMP \nalso  contains  detailed  cost  estimates  for  its  implementation.  Several  public  stakeholder \nconsultations have been held. A survey on the Project and its potential social and environmental \nbenefits as well as the views expressed by the project affected people, have been incorporated \nin the final EIA. The summary EIA was prepared and provided to the Government on 14 August \n2006. \n \n69.  Important issues that have been considered in the EIA include the effects of the Project \non ambient air, and surface water and groundwater quality. A range of technical mitigation and \npollution control measures, as well as capacity building, has been recommended for inclusion in \nthe Project to reduce these impacts to acceptable levels. Moreover, a detailed monitoring \nprogram has been developed for ambient air and water quality. The effect of the Project on \nmangrove ecosystems also has been considered, and a program of mangrove replanting to \noffset identified biodiversity losses is included in the Project. These have been discussed with \nEVN and TPPMU1, which they have agreed to implement the measures indicated in the EMP. \nThe EIA for the transmission lines that will transmit the power generated by the power plant is \nincluded in a previous approved loan in 2005. \n \n70.  Social and Gender. The Project is formulated to minimize potential social and gender \nrisks, and such impacts have been assessed along with other potential risks. The social impact \nof  the  Project  involves  (i)  loss  of  livelihood, (ii)  land  acquisition,  (iii)  forest  and  mangrove \nencroachment, (iv) affect on aquatic resources, and (v) incremental pollution from coal dust. The \nsocial analysis indicates that the Project will not affect any ethnic minority households. Thus, \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is not triggered. The Project could increase the potential \nfor the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases due to the influx of workers \n ", "20    \nduring construction. However, this potential will be mitigated or minimized through a program to \nincrease awareness and provide preventive measures for the local communities and workforce. \nThe Project will address social impact through capacity building of the stakeholders at the \ngrassroots level to increase the role of local communities in implementing and monitoring the \nresettlement  activities,  occupational  health  and  safety  program,  HIV/AIDS,  and  trafficking \nawareness campaign. The Summary of Poverty Reduction and Gender Strategy (Appendix 13) \ninclude measures to facilitate participation of the affected people and relevant stakeholders. The \nincreased capability and awareness of men and women commune leaders, men and women \nrepresentatives from affected households and the implementing agency will enable effective \nimplementation of the resettlement plan, EIA, occupational health and safety program, and \nHIV/AIDS.  \n \n71.  Occupational Health and Safety Management System. Health-related hazards in the \nproject area primarily include respiratory problems, lung disease, and eyes and nose infections. \nIn Mong Duong, 68% of children are reported to suffer from respiratory diseases, while 50% \nhave  nose  and  eyes  infection.  The  Project  will  establish  an  Occupational  Health  and \nManagement System (OHSMS) that will include raising awareness and training employees and \nresidents to change the prevailing safety and health protection cultures, particularly burning of \ncoal in households for cooking and heating. The OHSMS will explore options for fuel switching \nby the households and include features for continual feedback and self-improvement. A safety \nand health committee will be established with active participation of men and women workers. \nSurveillance of the workers health system will be incorporated. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n72.  The financial and economic viability of the Project depends on the implementation of the \nother  components  of  the  power  system\u2019s  expansion  in  northern  Viet  Nam.  These  include \ninvestments in the transmission network and supplementary power generation capacity to avoid \noverloading of facilities and suboptimal generation operation. EVN and the private sector are \nmaking  concerted  efforts  to  mobilize  financing  and  implement  these  projects  successfully. \nTherefore, these risks are not considered serious, because (i) some new generation plants are \nunder construction in northern Viet Nam, and (ii) ADB and the World Bank are financing the \nhigh-voltage  transmission  and  distribution  networks.  Through  the  proposed  power  sector \nreforms, the Government is taking steps to create an enabling environment that removes entry \nbarriers for third parties. These reforms are on track, with MOI taking the lead in promoting the \nregulatory framework to accelerate the reforms. Further, the Project, along with domestic private \nsector investors, is facilitating the mobilization of private sector investment in generation. \n \n73.  The financial projections of EVN have been prepared on the following assumptions: (i) \noperational efficiency continues to improve, (ii) proceeds continue to be received from EVN\u2019s \nequitization (partial privatization) program, and (iii) tariff increases are implemented in a timely \nmanner to ensure EVN\u2019s prudent compliance with financial covenants. The projected reduction \nin system losses from 12.1% to 10.1 % in 2011 will improve EVN\u2019s operational efficiency. If the \nassumptions on fuel costs, cost of purchased power from IPPs, and the shift in the consumer \nmix deteriorate, tariffs would have to be adjusted. The sensitivity of financial ratios (used as \nfinancial covenants) to the adverse movements of these assumptions was assessed, which is \ndeemed important in the context of the proposed single buyer market structure. The Electricity \nRegulator, established in 2005 under the Electricity Law, continues to build its capacity to set \ntariffs transparently on sound economic and financial grounds, which will mitigate this risk \nsignificantly. The World Bank is assisting the Electricity Regulator in developing the framework \ntariff-setting mechanisms. \n \n ", "    21 \n74.  Private investment in new projects and EVN\u2019s ongoing program equitization existing \npower plants is envisaged to increase. The financial proceeds from selling equity stakes will \nalso contribute significantly to EVN\u2019s cash flows. As such, EVN\u2019s financials are assumed to be \nat risk if the equitization program is unsuccessful. However, this may not be the case as the \nPrime Minister approved EVN\u2019s equitization plan in April 2007 to complete the equitization \nprocess by end 2008..As the power market in Viet Nam is relatively underdeveloped, ADB, \nAFD, and the World Bank will establish regulatory mechanisms through ongoing TAs that \nencourage the private sector to take the market and regulatory risks that arise in the electricity \nmarket. \n \n75.  Social and resettlement risks involve the possibility that compensation, resettlement, and \nincome restoration measures might not be delivered as agreed, thereby disadvantaging affected \npeople and possibly delaying the start of civil works. This risk is being mitigated by ensuring that \nthe consultants and TPPMU1 have appropriate and competent specialists to assist in updating \nand implementing the resettlement plan. TPPMU1 will also engage an independent monitoring \norganization to supervise implementation. The establishment of the OHSMS for surveillance of \nworkers  health,  together  with  efficient  awareness  and  training  programs,  will  mitigate \noccupational health risks. The diversion of the river and discharge channel will affect marine \nfisheries  and  mangrove  areas,  reducing  the  livelihood  potential  of  the  fisherfolk.  The \nresettlement plan incorporates compensation arrangements for loss of fisheries, while the EIA \nwill incorporate a community-based mitigation plan for fishery and community involvement in \nreplanting of mangroves. The continuation of economic growth of 7.5% is assumed. Slower \ngrowth would reduce the rate of growth in electricity demand. However, the analysis of risks \nshows that the economic viability of the investment program remains robust even with adverse \nchanges in anticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and assumptions.  \n \n76.  Another possible risk is that a second PFR and second loan will not be made. In that \nscenario, the Project could be completed under financing provided by parties that do not require \nthat  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  be  applied  to  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s  strong  and  continuing \nrelationship with EVN and the Government mitigates this risk considerably. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n77.

Lessons learned from the \noperation  of  Ash  Pond  1  should  be  incorporated  into  the  detailed  design \nactivities. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n78.  As conditions for loan effectiveness of the first loan under the MFF, a Subsidiary Loan \nAgreement will have been duly executed on behalf of EVN and will become fully effective, and \nall conditions precedent to its effectiveness will have been fulfilled. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n79.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $930,710,000 equivalent to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Mong \nDuong 1 Thermal Power Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the Financing Framework Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n28 August 2007 \n \n ", " 24  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms   \n \nImpact  5 years after project completion    Risk \n      Economic growth \nAdequate and reliable  About 30 GW of additional  EVN statistics.  forecasts are not realized.  \nsupply of power to  generation capacity by 2015.     \nmeet Viet Nam\u2019s         Assumption \nelectricity demand in  Ratio of hydro to thermal plant    Mainstreaming of \nan environmentally  capacity reduced from 37% in    environmental \nsustainable manner.  2006 to 27% by 2015.    considerations in future \n      power sector \nDiversified generation  Economic growth in Quang Ninh    development.  \nfuel mix.

General Overview \n \n1.  Vietnam Electricity (EVN) is a large and complex organization whose core business is \nthe  supply  of  electricity  throughout  Viet  Nam.  However,  EVN  also  has  some  non-core \nbusinesses engaged in manufacturing and other industries, the largest being EVN Telecoms. \nEVN  is  organized  into  a  number  of  different  types  of  entities,  including  15  independent \naccounting units, 20 dependent accounting units, 6 administrative units, 14 construction and \nproject management units, and some subsidiaries and joint ventures in which EVN controls \nmore than 50% of the voting rights. In early 2007, the Government decided to convert EVN into \na holding company called Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) and most of its operating entities will be \nconverted to limited liability companies with EVN retaining whole or partial ownership. \n2.  EVN was created in 1995 as a vertically integrated entity responsible for the electricity \nsector  in  Viet  Nam.  EVN\u2019s  operations  have  been  profitable  and  it  has  financed  the  rapid \nexpansion  of  the  electricity  sector  without  significant  fiscal  subsidies.  The  key  financial \nperformance indicators, such as debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), self-financing ratio (SFR), \nand receivables, have been maintained at prudential limits. Meanwhile, the average end user \ntariff  has  been  maintained  at  around  Vietnamese  Dong  (D)  853  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh) \n($0.053/kWh). However, to satisfy future demand for electricity resulting from rapid economic \ngrowth, EVN will need to make considerable investments in generation, transmission, and \ndistribution. A substantial portion of these investments will be financed by debt, sustained tariff \nincreases are required to maintain adequate levels of debt service and self financing of these \nnew investments. \nB.  Historical Performance \n3.  EVN's electricity sales have doubled in 2000\u20132005, representing average annual growth \nof 15.2%. Although the average tariffs net of sales taxes have increased only marginally from \nD660/kWh  ($0.047/kWh)  in  2000  to  D810/kWh  ($0.05/kWh)  by  2005,  EVN\u2019s  revenue  has \nincreased from D16.8 trillion ($1,160 million) in 2000 to D38.0 trillion ($2,400 million) in 2005. \nFurther, its net profit nearly tripled from D888 billion ($62 million) in 2000 to D2.8 trillion (about \n$180 million) in 2005.  \n4.  In recent loans approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank, the \nBanks and the Government of Viet Nam (the Government) agreed to adopt new financial \ncovenants based on (i) consolidated EVN financial statements; and (ii) EVN's overall financial \nviability  and  performance,  rather  than  arbitrarily  setting  tariffs  in  foreign  currency.  These \ncovenants were included in two recently approved loans1 as follows: (i) self-financing ratio \n(SFR) of 25%, (ii) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.5, and (iii) debt-equity ratio of 70:30. \nEVN complied with these covenants during 2000 to  2005. However, there has been a reduction \nin EVN\u2019s net cash flow and operating profits due to absence of tariff increases from 2003 -2006. \nThis has reduced the SFR to 25% in 2005 from 70% in 2003, and DSCR to 2.0 in 2005 from 5.3 \nin 2003. This is expected to be reversed with tariff increases of 8.8% effective from 1 January \n2007 and a further 5% increase in July 2008. The retail tariffs beyond 2009 will be adjusted to \nreflect the market prices in the competitive generation market to be set up in 2009. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n1.  Sales and Income \n5.  The  fastest  growth  in  electricity  sales  has  been  in  the  industrial  sector,  where  the \naverage annual growth was between 17% and 18% during 2000-2005 period. As a result, the \nindustrial sector\u2019s share of overall demand increased from 40% in 2000 to 45% in 2005. The \nhousehold sector also has shown considerable annual growth, averaging 12% over the past 12 \nyears. This is a result of increasing demand by existing customers and additional demand from \nnew connections, as more households are connected to the electricity supply system.  \n6.  More than 90% of EVN\u2019s revenue comes from electricity sales, with only 8% from other \nservices and products. Income from the telecommunications business, at D378 billion in 2005,is  \nless than 1% of EVN\u2019s total income. However, EVN Telecoms has its own ambitious investment \nand expansion plans, particularly regarding the development of its mobile telephone service and \nis expected to be a major contributor to EVN\u2019s consolidated revenues from 2007 onwards. \n2.   Production and Supply \n7.  In  2005,  EVN  produced  more  than  52.3  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  from  its  own  power \nstations, and purchased an additional 12.5 TWh from independent power producers (IPP). The \nlargest source of power was hydroelectricity (33%), followed by gas turbines (28%), fuel oil \n(23%), and coal-fired power stations (16%). IPPs (including imports) account for 24% of total \nsupply. However, electricity from hydropower has declined by 7% due to adverse hydrological \nconditions, resulting in a deficit that has been made up primarily from gas-fired power stations \nand an increase in power purchases from IPPs. As the gas-fired power plants are in the south, \npower is transmitted to the north at a high cost to meet the power shortages. This has resulted n \nhigher operating expenses and lower operating profits in 2005 compared to 2004.  \n3.  Operating Costs \n8.  Depreciation is one of the largest operating costs for EVN, accounting for over 30% of its \noperating costs. Under the Vietnamese Accounting System (VAS), depreciation periods are \ngenerally shorter than those allowed under International Accounting Standards, which accounts \nfor the relatively high levels of depreciation. EVN also relies on these high levels of depreciation \nto fund its future capital expenditure program and to improve the SFR. The other major cost \nitems are fuel costs for thermal power stations and purchased electricity from IPPs. EVN uses \nlower calorific value (4,000\u20135,500 kilocalories per kilogram [kcal/kg] of domestic anthracite coal \nfor power generation. Generally, this coal has little value unless it is washed. The higher-quality \nanthracite coal is exported as coking coal. For this type of coal, EVN\u2019s cost currently varies from \n$24\u2013$28/ton but future prices will increase. Gas prices are denominated in US dollars, based on \nagreed volume and long-term contracts. In recent months, new agreements have been linked to \na fuel price index due to increased drilling costs. EVN does not receive any direct operating \nsubsidies from the Government to cover its operating costs. However, the Government does \ninject additional capital to help finance specific investments, such as the Son La hydropower \nplant and provides access to lower interest loans from state-owned banks.  \n4.  Capital Expenditure \n9.  During  2000\u20132005,  EVN  invested  more  than  D81.5 trillion  in  new  capital  works. \nApproximately 45% of this expenditure has been financed by taking out additional long-term \nloans, while the remainder was financed from its own resources (50%) and capital injections by \nthe Government (5%). Outstanding long-term loans have increased from about D26.9 trillion in \n2000 to more than D53.7 trillion by 2005. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n \nC.   Financial Projections (2005\u20132010)  \n1.  Sales and Revenue \n10.  The corporate structure of EVN is envisaged to change under the proposed power \nsector reforms. However, EVN is likely to remain a holding company, owning significant stakes \nof the operating subsidiaries. Electricity sales are assumed to reach 108 terawatt-hours (TWh) \nin 2011, compared with 44.5 TWh in 2005, representing annual growth of 16% during 2006\u2013\n2011. Electricity sales by each regional distribution company have been projected for different \nconsumer categories, and consolidated to derive the total sales and projected revenues. The \nprojections are based on tariff assumptions prepared by EVN to ensure compliance with loan \ncovenants. An increase of 8.8% in the average tariff level of D853/kWh ($0.053/kWh) effective \nfrom 1 January 2007 and 5% effective from the middle of 2008 are assumed in the projections.   \n2.  Operating Expenses \n11.  The operating expenses of EVN largely depend on the plant mix used for meeting the \nforecast demand and fuel price projections. The plant mix for 2006\u20132011 is based on the \neconomic  merit  order  dispatch  of  the  available  plants  at  different  years,  subject  to  the \nhydrological  and  transmission  constraints  and  contractual  commitments  with  IPPs.  System \nlosses are to be reduced from their current level of 12.6% to about 10.9% by 2011. In addition, \nEVN is expected to increase its purchases from third parties from 12.5 TWh in 2005 to 33.6 \nTWh  from  by  2011\u2014i.e.,  about  27%  of  total  generation  of  125 TWh  from  private  power \nproducers, joint venture companies, and imports.  \n12.  Fuel consumption is based on the projected plant mix, and the fuel expenses were \nbased on Viet Nam\u2019s expected domestic fuel prices. Coal prices are kept at around $24\u2013$28 per \nton during 2005\u20132010. Although these are below the prevailing international coal prices, the \ncoal used by EVN is of lower quality. As such, the price is not directly comparable with the \ninternational prices for good-quality coal. The absence of data on actual production costs of \ndifferent types of coal mines and a transparent coal market in Viet Nam make identifying any \nimplicit subsidy to EVN through the discounted coal prices difficult. Gas prices are based on the \nproduction share agreements signed with the international gas field developers.  \n3.   Capital Expenditures \n13.  EVN is to make cumulative capital investments of D234 trillion ($14.2 billion) during \n2006\u20132011, compared with D81.5 trillion during 2000\u20132005 implying a threefold increase in the \ncapital investment. The debt service commitment during 2006\u20132011 will also increase to D79 \ntrillion,  compared  with  D20  trillion  in  the  previous  6-year  period.  In  addition  to  the  direct \ninvestments, EVN is also planning to form joint venture companies to implement some of the \npower generation projects (e.g., Hai Phong coal power plant) in 2006\u20132011, and plans to invest \nD14  trillion ($880  million)  of  equity  in  these  companies.  Investments  by  non-EVN  entities, \nincluding  the  private  sector  (mainly  in  power  generation),  would  complement  EVN\u2019s  direct \ninvestments and investments through joint ventures.  \n14.  Although its internal cash generation is projected to reach D152 trillion ($9.5 billion) \nduring  2006\u20132011,  EVN  will  finance  a  significant  portion  of  the  investments  through  net \nborrowings totaling D160 trillion. This represents significantly more borrowing compared with \n2000\u20132005, when EVN\u2019s net borrowings totaled D48 trillion. In the absence of significant equity \ninjections,  this  investment  plan  will  substantially  increase  EVN\u2019s  debt  and  its  debt  service \nrequirements. The debt-equity ratio would increase from 53:47 in 2005 to 68:32 in 2011, while \nthe debt service requirements would rise from D5.5 trillion to D21 trillion in the same period. As \na result, the DSCR would drop to 1.96 by 2011. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s transition from a lightly \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \ngeared utility due to lack of access to debt financing before 1995 to a more typical utility in a \nfast-growing economy. \nD.  Future Developments \n15.  EVN is moving away from its traditional role of generating its own electricity to one in \nwhich it buys a considerable amount of electricity from third parties, and then transmits and \ndistributes it to end users. There is a strong case for splitting EVN into a number of independent \nentities, such as transmission companies, distribution companies, and power stations (where \nthe State\u2019s shares in these entities are held by a Holding Company), as a way of increasing \ntransparency in the functioning of the market. The Government has approved a plan for EVN to \nequitize (i.e., partially privatize) minority stakes in most power generation plants and regional \npower companies. As of July 2007, three power plants, including a 1,000 MW coal power plant, \na provincial power distribution utility, and 17 non-core businesses had been equitized. The \nliabilities associated with the equitized entities were transferred to the equalized entity, and the \npar value was computed net of the liabilities. The cash proceeds from the equalization will \nimprove EVN\u2019s cash flow. However, the debt-equity ratio of EVN as a consolidated entity will not \nbe affected, as EVN intends to retain a majority stake in the equalized entities.  \n16.  As a means of attracting non-EVN investments to the sector, EVN is planning to form \nseveral joint ventures for the construction and operation of some power stations. The liabilities \nof new power plants to be developed as joint ventures between EVN and other parties\u2014where \nEVN is expected to be the majority shareholder\u2014are consolidated in the financial projections. In \nthe case of joint ventures where EVN is the minority shareholder, EVN\u2019s share of the expected \nprofit from these entities appears on its balance sheet as profit from other activities in the \nprojections. \n \nE.  Proposed Covenants \n17.  With EVN\u2019s increasing indebtedness, a maximum long-term debt-equity ratio of 70:30 \nand a minimum DSCR of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to ensure that the company\u2019s \ndebt level and its debt service capacity remain within prudential limits. Although the debt-equity \nratio is increasing steadily and DCSR is decreasing, they remain within these limits during the \nforecast period, except in 2010 when the debt-equity ratio exceeds 70:30. A minimum SFR of \n25% is imposed to ensure that EVN generates adequate cash flows to finance a reasonable \nportion of the capital investments, thereby keeping the company's leverage within prudential \nlimits. These covenants were included in a loan approved in 2004 and another approved in \n2005 (Footnote 1), and EVN complied comfortably with them. Whether EVN will comply with \nloan covenants in 2006 and future years depends largely on future tariff increases and fuel price \nfluctuations.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO

The  Project  will  cause  the  loss  of  approximately  41  hectares  (ha)  of  mangrove \necosystems across the project site, as a result of (i) clearing during site preparation; or (ii) \nindirect adverse effects caused by changes to hydrology, tidal regime, or water quality during \nproject operation. Loss of mangrove vegetation will result in deterioration of biodiversity, water \nquality, aquatic nurturing, and coastal protection values at the project site. In turn, this will \ncontribute to the ongoing degradation of mangrove ecosystems in northern Viet Nam. Mangrove \necosystems in this region already are threatened by resource extraction, as well as land use \nchange  for  aquaculture,  industrial,  and  infrastructure  uses.  To  offset  the  expected  loss  of \nmangrove  ecosystems,  a  mangrove  management  and  monitoring  plan  (MMMP)  has  been \nprepared, and is included in the environmental impact assessment (EIA). The central feature of \nthe MMMP is the replanting of up to 100 ha of mangrove vegetation in the Bai Tu Long National \nPark, which is approximately 18 kilometers west of the project site. The park, which is in the \nsame  bio-geographic  zone  as  the  project  site,  was  selected  as  the  preferred  location  for \nreplanting activities in part because of the security of future land tenure and use. It also offers \nthe  potential  to  involve  the  provincial  Forest  Protection  Department  and  National  Park \nManagement Board in the replanting activities. Thus, institutional strengthening is provided to \nthese organizations.   \n \n2.  The Project will also cause the loss of more than 35 ha of plantation forestry ecosystems \nacross  the  project  site  as  a  result  of  clearing  during  site  preparation.  These  ecosystems \ncomprise  predominantly  exotic  Acacia  and  Eucalypt  forestry  vegetation,  which  has  high \nsocioeconomic value for households and businesses in the project area, but relatively low \nbiodiversity value. Measures to address losses of plantation forestry ecosystems are contained \nin the resettlement plan and a terrestrial ecology management and monitoring plan. An outline is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix G. The key measures that will be implemented include (i) \nminimization  of  the  project  footprint  during  detailed  design  activities,  (ii)  protection  and \nmonitoring of areas of retained vegetation on site, (iii) compensation for loss of forestry crops, \n(iv) allocation of new areas of forestry land, and (v) livelihood stabilization assistance measures \nfor households affected by forestry losses caused by the Project.  \n \nA.  Outline of Mangrove Monitoring and Management Plan  \n3.  The specific objectives of the MMMP are to \n(i)  identify measures to avoid or minimize the loss of mangrove vegetation at the \nproject site,  \n(ii)  identify practical and cost-effective measures to offset residual impacts, and \n(iii)  develop a program of ongoing monitoring to ensure the success of mitigation \nmeasures and the condition of mangrove ecosystems.  \n4.  Measures to avoid or minimize impacts on mangrove vegetation will be the top priority \nfor implementation, and will include the following: \n(i)  minimize  the  project  footprint,  and  confine  construction  activities  to  defined \nareas; \n(ii)  undertake dredging activities of cooling water intake and discharge channel to \nmaximize distance from mangrove stands; and \n(iii)  eliminate  the  need  to  install  concrete  lining  in  Mong  Duong  River  diversion \nchannel to encourage natural recolonization of mangroves.  \n5.  To offset residual impacts on mangrove ecosystems, approximately 100 ha of mangrove \nvegetation will be replanted (representing a 1:2.5 replacement ratio) in the Bai Tu Long National \nPark. Key features of the replanting activities are as follows: \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \n(i)  The replanting activities will aim to replicate, as far as possible, the structure and \ntype of mangrove ecosystems at the replanting sites.  \n(ii)  A detailed field survey of the replanting sites will be carried out to develop site-\nspecific replanting targets and monitoring parameters. \n(iii)  A specialist mangrove replanting contractor will carry out replanting activities, \nwith the involvement of Quang Ninh Forest Protection Department and Bai Tu \nLong National Park Management Board staff. \n(iv)  Replanting  techniques  will  be  based  on  practical  expertise  developed  in \nreplanting programs in northern Viet Nam. \n(v)  Cuttings of mangroves will be sourced from the project site before clearing, \nnatural  seedling  collection  at  the  replanting  site,  and/or  an  existing  nursery \noperated by Quang Ninh Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. \n(vi)  A qualified mangrove ecologist will monitor replanting success and condition \nduring, and after completion of, replanting activities. The aim is train National \nPark staff during this time to take over monitoring activities in the long term. \n \nB.  Terrestrial Ecology Monitoring and Management Plan Outline \n \n6.  The objectives of the terrestrial ecology management and monitoring plan are to: \n(i)  identify practical and cost-effective mitigation measures for the impacts of the \nProject on terrestrial ecology, other than mangrove ecosystems; and \n(ii)  propose a monitoring program to measure the success of mitigation measures \nand the environmental performance of the Project. \n \n7.  The following measures will be implemented to avoid or reduce impacts on terrestrial \nvegetation in the project area: \n(i)  minimize the footprint of the construction works, as far as practical;  \n(ii)  mark boundaries of construction worksites with temporary fencing or plastic tape \nor similar; \n(iii)  ensure construction activities are contained within identified worksites, and no \nvegetation is cleared unnecessarily; \n(iv)  prohibit construction and operation workers from directly or indirectly disturbing \nremaining terrestrial vegetation and extracting resources such as firewood, and \npenalize breaches of this requirement; and \n(v)  implement sediment controls on the project site.  \n \n8.  Because of the generally low biodiversity value and high socioeconomic value of the \necosystems on the project site, compensation measures will focus on restoration of lost income \nand productivity for households affected by loss of forestry crops. Compensation measures will \ninclude \n(i)  income restoration for lost forestry crops; \n(ii)  allocation of new areas of forestry land; and \n(iii)  livelihood  stabilization  assistance  measures,  as  described  in  the  Project\u2019s \nresettlement plan.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nA.

General Overview \n1.  Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) is the Executing Agency for the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power \nProject, while the Thermal Power Project Management Unit 1 (TPPMU1) is the Implementing \nAgency. This appendix assesses the capability of EVN and TPPMU1 to handle the proposed \nProject.  \n \n2.  Government-owned  EVN  is  responsible  for  (i)  producing,  transmitting,  and  supplying \nelectricity;  (ii)  designing  and  constructing  relevant  projects;  (iii)  manufacturing  electrical \nequipment; and (iv) providing related services to customers. TPPMU1, which is fully owned by \nEVN, is authorized to manage and organize thermal power plant projects in northern Viet Nam. \nEVN and TPPMU1 have experience in implementing major projects funded by international \nfunding agencies. Since its inception in 1995, TPPMU1 has managed one large project funded \nby Japan Bank for International Cooperation and several other projects funded by EVN and \nlocal banks.  \n \nB.  Flow of Funds \n3.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) and EVN are the financiers of the Project. ADB will \nfinance equipment, civil works, international and national consultants, contingencies, interest \nduring construction, and commitment fee. However, ADB will not finance any taxes and duties \nrelated  to  these  expenditures.  EVN  will  finance  local  overhead,  project  preparation, \nadministration, resettlement, and all taxes and duties. Under the ADB loan, foreign and local \nequipment will be paid directly to the contractors. For expenditures not covered by the ADB \nloan, TPPMU1 will establish a separate bank account for receiving necessary fund transfers \nfrom EVN.  \n \nC.  Staffing and Accounting Policies, Budgeting System, and Payments  \n4.  TPPMU1  has  about  100  employees,  with  specialists  in  engineering,  environment, \nresettlement, economics, and finance. TPPMU1 reported having sufficient staff to carry out all \nits tasks and meet deadlines. Most of the staff has Vietnamese degrees in accounting, finance, \neconomics,  or  similar  discipline.  Although  no  specific  regular  training  program  exists  for \nTPPMU1 finance staff, most have been trained to record the transactions in implementing the \nprojects. The Government requires EVN to comply with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards \n(VAS). Accordingly, EVN has adopted, for all its business units, uniform accounting policies and \nprocedures, documentation, and charts of accounts suitable to power sector. The consolidated \naccounts are converted later to International Accounting Standards (IAS). \n \n5.  EVN and TPPMU1 have proven experience in the efficient management, budgeting, and \nfund disbursement in past projects. Budgets for physical and financial targets were prepared in \nsufficient detail. The project management and accounting staff compare invoice quantities, \nprices, and terms with those indicated on the purchase order, and with the records of goods and \nservices actually received, and check the accuracy of calculations.  \n \nD.  Policies and Procedures, Cash and Bank \n6.  EVN follows VAS, and has an adequate policy and procedures manual to guide activities \nand ensure staff accountability. In March 1998, ADB worked with Ministry of Finance (MOF) in \npreparing a \u201cManual on Project Accounting and Disbursement Procedures\u201d for ADB financed \n ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nprojects. EVN uses this manual, and updates it as necessary in accordance with the changes \nrequired by ADB and the Government. The procedures exist to ensure that only authorized \npersons of the (MOF) can alter or establish a new accounting principle, policy, or procedure to \nbe used by EVN. \n \n7.  TPPMU1 uses EVN\u2019s new computerized finance system (developed with World Bank \nfunding) to record all transactions. This is a sophisticated system that allows the input of invoice \ndetails and authorizes payments. Summary information is transferred electronically to EVN \nheadquarters  monthly.  The  adequacy  of  the  existing  accounting  policies  and  financial \nprocedures has been assessed1 in light of the Vietnamese Accounting System (VAS) and IAS. \nA comparison of major accounting policies between VAS and IAS shows that, for most part, the \nBusiness Accounting Policies promulgated by MOF for all Vietnamese enterprises and adopted \nby EVN conforms with IAS. However, certain policies are still at variance with IAS, particularly: \naccounting for (i) foreign currency and translation; (ii) fixed asset capitalization; (iii) fixed asset \ndepreciable amount, rate, and method; (iv) amortization of intangible assets and organization \nexpenses; (v) long-term investment; (vi) reporting requirement; (vii) accounting frameworks; and \n(viii) audit.   \n \n8.  The  director  and  the  deputy  director  of  finance  of  TPPMU1  are  the  authorized \nsignatories on the bank accounts. EVN has its own established procedures and mechanisms for \ncollecting money from end users in payment for their electricity bills. The deputy head of finance \nand the appropriate TPPMU1 project manager reconcile the bank statements every month. The \nTPPMU1 director and the finance director review and approve all unusual items on the bank \nreconciliation. \n \nE.  Safeguard Over Assets and Reporting \n9.  TPPMU1  is  responsible  only  for  implementing  projects;  the  completed  projects  are \nhanded over to another EVN entity to operate and maintain. EVN follows the Government \nsystem of adequate safeguards to protect assets from fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption. Viet \nNam law expects people who suspect others of participating in corrupt practices to report them \nto  the  \u201cappropriate\u201d  authorities.  Measures  taken  include  the  issue  of  the  Anti-corruption \nOrdinance dated 26 February 1998. Solutions for preventing, detecting, and enforcing penalties \nfor corruption are also included. This ordinance\u2014coupled with the strictness of law enforcement \nagencies in recent corruption cases\u2014has restored some confidence in the law and justice \nsystems regarding anticorruption measures. The director of TPPMU1 must approve all additions \nor amendments to TPPMU1\u2019s payroll.  \n \n10.  EVN and TPPMU1 are able to maintain separate accounts for the Project. TPPMU1, \nthrough EVN, will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB.2 The reports should provide a \nnarrative of (i) progress made during the quarter, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, \n(iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) the work to be carried out in the next period. \nTPPMU1 should be able to prepare these financial reports automatically from their finance \nsystem, though some assistance probably will be required initially to ensure the reports are \nproviding the necessary information, and that all the information balances. \n \n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  1997.  Project  Appraisal  Document  for  Viet  Nam:  Transmission,  Distribution,  and  Disaster \nReconstruction Project. Washington, DC. \n2  EVN\u2019s progress reports for previous projects have been submitted on time, and the quality of these reports was \nadequate. \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \n \n11.  In addition to the quarterly reports, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, \nTPPMU1 should submit to ADB its annual audited accounts of EVN and annual audited financial \nstatements of the Project. The annual financial statements will be a consolidated for all EVN\u2019s \noperations. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these \nreports, and will meet with EVN, TPPMU1, and the Government annually to discuss project \nprogress. A project completion report (PCR) should be submitted to ADB within 3 months of \nproject completion.  \n \nF.  Internal Audit and External Audit \n12.  Independent auditors audit the financial statements of EVN and TPPMU1 annually. \nSince 1999, their audits have not been delayed. The audit of EVN was conducted mostly in \naccordance with the International Standards on Auditing for public institutions.  \n \n13.  During 2001, EVN discovered that certain costs were included improperly as part of \nconstruction  in  progress  as  of  31  December  2000.  This  led  to  a  restatement  of  financial \nstatements for 2000. In 2002, EVN revalued some of its power station assets, which increased \ntheir value by about D3,000 billion. The external auditors noted that this revaluation violated IAS \nprinciples, because any revaluation should be applied to the whole class of assets, not just a \nsubset. Otherwise, the auditors have not made any significant qualification to EVN\u2019s accounts \nduring the past 5 years. According to the external auditors, EVN and all of its units generally \nkeep their accounts properly, consistent with Viet Nam\u2019s laws and regulations. Further, the \nauditors commented that the units of EVN have improved how quickly they produce their \naccounts over the last few years. In addition, the auditors reported that fewer management \nletters have noted improved procedures in recent years with fewer significant internal control \nissues identified, while the number of qualified audit opinions has declined.  \n \n14.  In March 1998, EVN established its Internal Audit Department, which is headed by a \nchief of internal audit and supported by five professional accountants. EVN relies heavily on \ndirect  supervision,  detailed  reporting,  and  authorization  from  top  management  for  internal \ncontrol.  This  internal  audit  ensures  proper  checks  and  balances,  and  delineation  of \nresponsibilities. Internal reviews are conducted as follows: (i) the Inspection Department, with a \nteam of selected representatives from the various business units, conducts inspections on \ncompliance with EVN policies and Government rules and regulations; (ii) an ad hoc inspection \nteam selected by the director general conducts inspections for certain activities of business \nunits; (iii) the Finance and Accounting Department team handles accounting supervision; and \n(iv)  the  Management  Board  and  the  Control  Section  of  the  Board  carry  out  inspections. \nInspections are conducted based on Government guidelines, and focus on the reviews of plans, \nexpenditures, contracts, and compliance. TPPMU1 has not been subject to an internal audit \nreport. \n \n15.  The consolidated financial accounts of EVN are submitted to the Ministry of Industry, \nMOF, and Tax Department for review and approval. MOF audits are used to determine tax \nliabilities, scheduled payments of \u201cstate-rented\u201d capital, and other financial matters. MOF\u2019s \nrevision committee has the right to audit any part of EVN, though TPPMU1 has not been subject \nto such an audit. EVN prepared financial statements of its previous projects in accordance with \nVAS. The TPPMU1 system prepares simple financial statements monthly, and this reporting \nshould be adopted to report on this Project. Although trying to link physical progress with \nfinancial progress could be useful in predicting estimated completion date and total cost, this is \nnot  really  necessary.  Most  contracts  by  TPPMU1  are  fixed-cost  contracts,  which  pay  a \ncontractor a predetermined amount when it completes a specific amount of physical work.  \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \n \n16.  Financial  reports  clearly  compare  the  actual  expenditures  with  budgeted  and \nprogrammed allocations. Automated accounting systems prepare the financial reports using \nspreadsheets  and  other  computerized  programs.  Under  the  current  accounting  system,  all \nEVN\u2019s dependent units, including TPPMU1, prepare and submit monthly accounting, financial \nstatements, and other financial reports to EVN. However, independent accounting units only \nsubmit  their  reports  quarterly.  EVN\u2019s  Accounting  Department  reviews  the  reports  before \nsubmission to EVN\u2019s Management Board for consolidation.  \n \n17.  The  computerized  accounting  system  EVN  is  using  is  still  being  evaluated,  and \nimprovements are being introduced as necessary. Financial statements prepared by TPPMU1 \nfocus on maintaining separate records and accounts adequately. It could identify (i) goods and \nservices financed from the proceeds of the loan, (ii) other financing resources received, (iii) \nexpenditures incurred in the Project, (iv) audit of resettlement expenditures, and (v) uses of local \nfunds. TPPMU1 has used the computerized financial management system, which can produce \nthe necessary project financial reports. EVN\u2019s and TPPMU1\u2019s finance and account staffs have \nbeen  trained  adequately  to  maintain  the  systems.  The  management  organization  and \nprocessing system has safeguarded the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.  \n \n18.  EVN will need to prepare terms of reference acceptable to ADB for the annual project \naudit. The auditing company should inspect and substantiate the accuracy and sustainability of \naccounting documents and figures, as well as other accounting finalization reports kept by EVN \nand TPPMU1. \n \nG.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n19.  In general, TPPMU1 appears to be a fit and proper body to administer the proposed \nADB loan for the Mong Duong I Project. While the assessment identified no significant weak \npoints, two minor points were identified. First, although the computer system is backed up \nregularly, the backups themselves are stored on TPPMU1\u2019s premises, rather than on a remote \nsite. Second, as TPPMU1 has no specific experience administering an ADB loan, the staff will \nrequire training in ADB procedures. However, they should have little difficulty in understanding \nand implementing these. If somebody from another EVN project management board with ADB \nloan experience (e.g., Northern Power Project Management Board) could share the details of \nadministering the loan, it would be useful. \n \n ", " \nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE  4\n2\n   \nTable A8.1: Multitranche Financing Facility Loan 1 \n   Ap\np\n    2007  2008  2009   2010 to 2013  e\nn\n Item  II  III  IV  I  II  III  IV  I  II  III  IV  I  II  III  IV  d\nix\nA.

Macroeconomic and Sector Context \n1.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has grown remarkably over the past decade. During 2000\u20132005, \naverage  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  was  7.3%\u2014with  growth  each  year \nexceeding the preceding one. In 2006, GDP growth was 8.2%. Industry and services, which \ntogether accounted for nearly 80% of GDP, was the main driver of economic growth. Industry \nexpanded by 10.3% and services by 7.5%, while the agriculture sector grew at 3.3%. The \naverage annual economic growth for 2006\u20132010 is expected to be about 8.5%, with industry \nexpanding at 11.0% and services at 8.0%. To increase competitiveness and maintain GDP \ngrowth of 8.5%, Viet Nam needs to maintain an investment level of more than 35% of GDP for \nthe next 10 years, to develop necessary physical infrastructure, including infrastructure in the \nenergy sector and power subsector. Demand for electricity is projected to grow. Maintaining \nadequate investments to meet this rapid growth in demand is a formidable task. According to \nthe 6th Power Development Master Plan (PDMP),1 the power sector requires an estimated $24.2 \nbillion  in  investments  for  2006\u20132010\u2014$17.1  billion  for  generation,  and  $7.1  billion  for  the \ntransmission and distribution network. \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n2.  The  average  annual  growth  rate  of  electricity  consumption  during  1990\u20132003  was \n14.2%. Average annual growth rate from 2000 to 2005 was 15.2%. Electricity demand will \ncontinue to grow at this high rate to support economic expansion. The 6th PDMP provides a \nprojection of electricity demand for 2006\u20132025. Table A10.1 contains the main indicators of the \ndemand projection of the 6th PDMP.  \n \nTable A10.1: Main Indicators of the Viet Nam Demand Forecast (2005\u20132025) \nItem  2005  2010  2015  2020  2025 \nAnnual demand (GWh)  45,600  97,110  164,960  257,260  381,160 \n5-year growth rate (%)    16.3%  11.2%  9.3%  8.2% \nPer capita consumption (kWh)  549  1,106  1,774  2,629  3,703 \nT&D losses and own-use (%)  14.7  13.8  13.2  12.5  11.7 \nPeak load (MW)  9,512  19,553  32,196  48,642  71,416 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution. \nSource: Institute of Energy, 2006, 6th PDMP, Hanoi. \n \n3.  As seen in Table A10.1, electricity demand will grow at 16.3% per year until 2010, and \n11.2% thereafter until 2015. The demand growth is driven by (i) rapid, broad-based growth in \nindustrial and commercial sectors; (ii) increase in electrification from less than 40% in 1990 to \nmore  than  88%  in  2005;  (iii)  urbanization;  and  (iv)  higher  living  standards,  with  domestic \ndemand growing at 19%. The demand for electricity and the corresponding peak load are \nexpected to reach 97.11 terrawatt-hours (TWh) and 19,553 MW, respectively, in 2010; and 165 \nTWh and 32,200 MW, respectively, in 2015. This compares with a demand of 39.7 TWh and \npeak load of 8,400 MW in 2004. System losses would be reduced from 14.7% in 2004 to 13.8% \nin 2010 and 12.3 % in 2015, while the load factor will improve from 65.7% in 2004 to 68.4% in \n2010 and 69.1% in 2015. \n                                                 \n1  The 6th PDMP has been approved by the Prime Minister on 16 July 2007.  \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \nC.  Least-Cost System Expansion Plan of the Viet Nam Power Sector \n1.  Existing Generating System \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s electricity system is a well-developed, unified system with a backbone of \n1,700 kilometer (km) of high-voltage (500 kilovolt [kV]) lines connecting all load and generation \ncenters. At the end of 2005, installed generating capacity of the Viet Nam power system totaled \n11,386 MW. The breakdown of this capacity by fuel type is given in Table A10.2. This capacity \nis provided by Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) power plants and those outside EVN (non-EVN \nplants). Non-EVN capacity accounts for 22.7 % of the total system capacity (Table A10.2). Non-\nEVN power plants, in turn, consist of independent power producers (IPP), build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) plants, and power plants owned by other enterprises in Viet Nam (e.g., Vinacomine and \nPetro Viet Nam). \n \nTable A10.2: Installed Capacity and Share by Fuel Type (End of 2005) \nType of Capacity  EVN  Non-EVN  Total (MW)  Share of Total \nHydro  4,069  150  4,219  37.1% \nCoal  1,245  210  1,455  12.8% \nOil  200  389  589  5.2% \nGas  3,037  1,841  4,878  42.8% \nDiesel  245    245  2.2% \nTotal  8,796  2,590  11,386  100.0% \n  EVN = Viet Nam Electricity, MW = megawatt. \nSource: EVN and Institute of Energy. \n \n2.  Options for Expansion of the Generating System \n5.  The options for future development of the power system, without looking at other system \nconstraints and investment requirements, are derived from the following considerations: (i) \navailability of domestic fuel supply, (ii) availability of domestic renewable energy resources, (iii) \npossibility of importing fuels, and (iv) power trade (import or export) with neighboring countries. \nViet  Nam  has  considerable  domestic  energy  resources  for  power  generation,  including \nhydropower, coal, natural gas and oil, and some potential of renewable energy sources. The \nhydro potential in Viet Nam is estimated at 308 TWh per year, with a capacity of 70,000 MW. \nThe economic potential is estimated at 120 TWh per year, with a capacity of 30,000 MW. Taking \ninto account the environment and social criteria, the feasible hydropower potential is estimated \nto be 20,750 MW, or 83 TWh per year\u2019s production.  \n \n6.  Thermal generating capacity in the future will rely on coal and natural gas. Plans also \nare being made to use imported coal for new thermal power generation after 2012, and nuclear \npower generation starting in 2020 (4,000 MW). Coal is available in Quang Ninh Province in the \nnorth, which makes the development of medium-to-large coal-fired power plants in the north \npossible. Plants under construction are in Quang Ninh, Cam Pha, Hai Phong, Ninh Binh, and \nUong Bi. The Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project is one of the coal power complexes to be \ndeveloped in the north by 2011. Coal power stations also are being built in central Viet Nam, \nsuch as the Nghi Son and Vung Anh power plants. Offshore natural gas has been used for \nelectricity generation in the south, close to the gas production sites. In the future, candidates \nunder consideration include power stations in O Mon power complex and expansion of the \nexisting Phi My power plants.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \n3.  System Planning Methodology \n7.  System  planning  is  formulated  based  on  the  set  of  candidate  plants,  taking  into \nconsideration constraints that reflect the fuel availability and system reliability criteria (power \nplant outage, maintenance requirement, transmission line reliability rule, etc.). Two gas supply \npossibilities were considered: 14 billion cubic meters and 10 billion cubic meters per year during \n2020\u20132025. The two most important reliability criteria are (i) the loss of load expectation (LOLE) \ncriteria applied to the whole generation system, and (ii) the rule n-1 applied to the transmission \ncapability. The LOLE criterion stipulates that the expected loss of load should not exceed 24 \nhours per year, expressed in hours LOLE < 24 per year. The n-1 rule takes care of the situation \nwhen one circuit of the double-circuit 500 kV line is not functioning, while the remaining system \nwill still work stably. \n \n8.  System optimization was carried out using software based on dynamic programming \noptimization  to  find  out  the  expansion  plan  with  lowest  total  discounted  costs.  Apart  from \ndemand data, other important inputs for optimization are (i) technical and financial economic \ndata  of  all  generation  sources,  fuel  types,  fuel  price,  investment  cost,  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) cost, efficiency, load factor, failure frequences, etc.; (ii) investment cost, \nvoltage, length, O&M cost, losses, failure frequences, etc., for transmission lines; and (iii) fuel \nsupply availability or limitation, and fuel costs. Investment costs of generation and transmission \ncandidates are taken from prefeasibility studies, if available, or estimated based on international \nand  national  experiences.  Fuel  costs  are  forecasted  taking  into  account  international \nprojections. O&M costs are based on the domestic and international practices. The costs are \neconomic costs without provision for taxes. Environmental costs are not included. \n \n4.  Least-Cost Expansion Generation Plan Up to 2025 \n9.  The  optimization  of  the  system  expansion  results  in  an  optimal  schedule  of  new \ncapacities to be added to the system for 2005\u20132025. The optimal expansion plan includes two \nstages  of  Mong  Duong  power  complex.  Stage  1  consists  of  two  units  of  500  MW  to  be \ncommissioned in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Stage 2 also consists of two units of 500\u2013600 \nMW, which are to be commissioned in 2012 and 2013. The optimal system expansion is a \ncombination of all types of generating capacities, reflecting the resource base of the country. \nHydropower will continue to be developed. Thermal power, such as gas and coal, will also have \ntheir share in the generation mix, as shown in Table A10.3. \n \nTable A10.3: Generating Capacity vs. Peak Demand of the System (2006\u20132025) \n \nItem  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nDemand (MW)  11,160  12,966  15,115  17,349  19,689  21,987  24,352  26,622  29,251  32,077 \nCapacity (MW)  12,107  14,397  18,312  22,524  26,157  29,975  33,206  35,930  38,035  40,337 \nReserve  7.8%  9.9%  17.5%  23.0%  24.7%  26.6%  26.7%  25.9%  23.1%  20.5% \n  2,016  2,017  2,018  2019  2,020  2,021  2,022  2,023  2,024  2,025 \nDemand (MW)   34,980  37,994  41,208  44,693  48,541  52,571  56,882  61,485  66,256  71,208 \nCapacity (MW)  44,993  50,195  53,695  57,145  62,765  65,265  71,846  76,646  82,296  88,096 \nReserve  22.3%  24.3%  23.3%  21.8%  22.7%  19.4%  20.8%  19.8%  19.5%  19.2% \nMW = megawatt. \nSources: Viet Nam Electricity and Institute of Energy. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \n \nD.  Economic Valuation of Costs and Benefits of Mong Duong Thermal Power Project \n10.

The \ncomparison takes into account the costs and benefits to the society of these two scenarios.  \n \n11.  Costs. The costs to the society are the investment and the operating costs of the \nProject, as well as environmental mitigating costs. Investment costs, in turn, can be broken \ndown into (i) equipment costs; (ii) construction costs; and (iii) engineering, administrative, and \nmanagement costs related to the construction of the power plant. A significant part of operating \ncosts include fuel costs (e.g., coal), and costs of limestone used in the circulating fluidized bed \n(CFB)  boiler.  The  total  costs  considered  also  include  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude \ninterest during the construction and price contingency. \nTable A10.4: Investment Costs of Mong Duong 1 in Economic Terms \nItem  Cost  Shadow Value \n   ($ million)  SERF  ($  million) \nCost of construction  251.7  1.0  251.7 \nCost of equipment  508.1  1.1  558.9 \nAdministration and other costs  30.9  1.0  30.9 \nPhysical contingency  79.5  1.1  87.5 \nEnvironmental costs  0.3  1.0  0.3 \nResettlement and land acquisition  3.6  1.0  3.6 \nTotal Investment Without IDC  874.1     932.9 \nIDC = interest during construction, SERF = shadow exchange rate factor. \nSource: Based on Viet Nam Electricity\u2019s project cost estimates.  \n \n12.  In this analysis, a domestic price numeraire is used. For ease of presentation, US dollar \nis chosen as the unit of currency, and all values in Vietnamese dong (D) are converted to US \ndollar values using the same exchange rate ($1 = D16,000). Equipment costs are estimated \nbased on international experience, and are quoted in US dollars (world price). To reflect the \nsocial value of the equipment, based on the domestic price numeraire, a shadow exchange rate \nfactor is used (SERF = 1.1 for Viet Nam)3. Construction costs and administrative costs are \nestimated based on domestic unit rates established under the Ministry of Construction, and are \nquoted as domestic price level numeraire. A summary of cost components are in Table A10.4. \n \n13.  Benefits. Results of the \"with Mong Duong 1\u201d scenario simulation show that the system \ndispatches about 6,400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) from the plant every year. In the \"without Mong \nDuong 1\u201d scenario, LOLE increases substantially, especially for the northern and southern \nregions. This reflects the severe worsening of system reliability without Mong Duong 1. Given \nthe national standard of less than 24 hours outage per year, the northern system will experience \nsevere difficulty in meeting reliability standards starting 2014, when the LOLE will exceed the \nstandard by two to three times. More importantly, since the system is integrated, the lack of \ncapacity in the north also leads to a large increase of LOLE in the south over the simulation \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

Power shortages in the north and south are likely to cause an economic slowdown, as \nindustrial and commercial businesses are concentrated in these regions. \n \n14.  The increase of the LOLE between the \"with\" and \"without\" scenarios is a measure of \nexpected  energy  not  served  had  the  same  value  of  LOLE  been  used  in  both  scenarios. \nIncreased production by thermal power plants in the northern and southern regions will cover \npart of the shortage without Mong Duong 1. The economic value of electricity generated by \nMong Duong 1 is measured by the costs to the society of not having it. This cost comprises the \ncosts of suboptimal operation of thermal power plants to partly replace Mong Duong 1, and the \ncosts to the consumers (industrial, residential, commercial) due to energy not served. In other \nwords, the societal benefits of having Mong Duong 1 is the sum of two components: (i) the non-\nincremental benefits accrued by not having to run thermal power plants at suboptimum, thereby \nproducing savings; and (ii) the incremental benefits accrued to the consumers by having a \nsufficient power supply.  \n \n15.  Non-Incremental Benefits. The extra generation by power plants in the northern region \nwill be coal-based, whereas in the south it will be gas-based. The average costs are $0.043 per \nkWh for coal and $0.053 per kWh for gas. These production costs are used to value the benefits \nof MD 1\u2014i.e., non-incremental benefits from the avoided costs of running thermal power plants \noutside their optimal regime. \n \n16.  Incremental  Benefits.  Since  thermal  power  plants  cannot  cover  the  anticipated \nelectricity shortage in the \"without Mong Duong 1\u201d scenario, consumers will experience power \nshortages. This represents the incremental value of the benefits of having Mong Duong 1. In the \n\u201cwithout\u201d scenario, lack of electricity supply means additional cost, but these costs will differ \namong consumer categories. Household consumers likely will have to curtail their consumption, \nwhile industrial and commercial consumers will use alternative generating sources to replace \nthe shortage of electricity. The cost to industrial and commercial consumers is the cost of \nalternative  generation.  According  to  experts  at  the  Institute  of  Energy,  the  most  popular \nreplacement for grid electricity is the stand-alone diesel generator, with capacity of 150 kilowatt \n(kW) to 5 MW. The levelized4 cost of diesel generation is $0.15/kWh. Table A10.5 summarizes \nthe  results  of  the  benefits  calculation.  It  contains  the  economic  value  of  Mong  Duong  1 \nelectricity from the consumer perspective. The net present value (NPV) of the benefits amounts \nto $918.7 million, while the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of Mong Duong 1 is 23.9%. \n \n                                                 \n4  To quantify the unitary cost of electricity (in kilowatt-hour) generated during the lifetime of a diesel power plant and \nto compare this with the cost of other alternative technologies (coal power plant, gas fired power plant, fuel oil fired \npower plant, hydropower plants, etc.).  \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \n \nTable A10.5: Economic Benefits of Mong Duong 1 Valued by Consumer Categories  \n($ million)  \nAvoided Costs of  Benefits to  Benefits to  Benefits to  Total \nThermal Power   Household  Industrial  Commercial  Benefits \nYear  Consumers  Consumers  Consumers \n2011  287.70  26.95  30.44  15.22  360.30 \n2012  280.84  35.90  40.56  20.28  377.58 \n2013  285.62  26.01  29.39  14.69  355.71 \n2014  291.71  27.99  31.62  15.81  367.13 \n2015  256.77  75.19  84.95  42.47  459.38 \n2016  264.46  64.04  72.34  36.17  437.01 \n2017  277.01  64.03  72.34  36.17  449.55 \n2018  270.04  63.72  71.98  35.99  441.73 \n2019  265.62  63.29  71.50  35.75  436.16 \n2020  264.32  62.27  70.34  35.17  432.09 \n2021  263.55  69.79  78.84  39.42  451.61 \n2022  272.96  55.39  62.58  31.29  422.22 \n2023  252.27  62.10  70.15  35.08  419.60 \n2024  243.35  64.39  72.74  36.37  416.84 \n2025  277.13  57.23  64.65  32.33  431.33 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n17.  The sensitivity of the NPV and EIRR to the main input parameters has been analyzed \nusing the @RISK program. The main input parameters for the sensitivity analysis include (i) \ngeneration level of Mong Duong 1; (ii) capital investment costs; and (ii) values that household, \nindustrial, and commercial consumers attach to the unserved electricity. Among these factors, \ntotal project cost plays an important role in the possible variation of cost components. As such, \nits influence on the total cost was analyzed first. The total project cost was broken down into \nequipment cost (54.2%), labor cost (16.5%), and cost of materials for construction (13.7%). The \nbalance is made up by contingencies, and environmental and social costs. According to the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment,5 the consumer price index (CPI) in Viet Nam increased an \naverage of 4.7% per year during 2000\u20132005. The price of construction materials increased \nmore quickly than other commodities. While energy prices, including coal, oil products, and \nelectricity, are still regulated by the Government, they have increased slightly. Labor cost in Viet \nNam is low and has not increased much.  \n \n18.  International and national experiences suggest that, of the three main cost categories, \nthe cost of construction materials is most likely to increase. Equipment costs are also likely to \nincrease, although not as much as construction materials. Labor costs will vary, and could rise \nas much as 5% (slightly higher than last 5-year average CPI). The impacts of the variation of the \ncost components on the total costs were investigated using Monte Carlo simulation method. A \ntotal of 500 combinations were simulated taking into account the ranges of labor costs (\u20133%, \n+5%), equipment costs (\u20133%, +10%), and construction material costs (\u20135%, +25%). The results \nindicate that the total project cost is most sensitive to the equipment costs, due to its large share \nin the total cost structure, followed by the cost of construction materials, and then labor. The \nrelative sensitivity indexes are 0.58 for equipment cost, 0.18 for material cost, and 0.15 for labor \ncost. This implies that for every 1% increase in equipment cost, the total project cost would \n                                                 \n5 Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005.

Similarly, every 1% change in the costs of materials would cause a 0.18% \nchange in the project total cost. All costs are economic costs, with proper adjustment using \nSERF to local costs. The resulting expected total cost is $905 million, with a standard deviation \nof $12.7 million, and minimum possible value of $870 million and maximum of $954 million. This \nresult  then  is  plugged  into  another  round  of  @RISK  simulation  to  determine  the  project \nrobustness for all inputs. Regarding the project generation level, the simulation of the whole \nsystem by the Institute of Energy demonstrated that the generation level varies between 6,064 \nGWh per year and 6,696 GWh per year. These boundary values also are used for @RISK \nsimulation. For the willingness to pay of consumers categories, it is assumed that they would \nvary within the -/+10% boundary. In summary, the ranges of the input parameters that were \nused for the Monte Carlo simulation are in Table A10.6. \n \nTable A10.6: Range of Values of Key Input Parameters for Sensitivity Analysis \n \nParameter  Low  Base  High \nGenerationa (GWh)  6,064.0  6,400.0  6,696.0 \nTotal costsb ($ million)  870.0  933.0  954.0 \nNon-HH_WTP    0.130  0.160 \n($/kWh)  (-10%)  0.145  (+10%) \n0.115  0.141 \nHH_WTP ($/kWh)  (-10%)  0.128  (+10%) \nGWh = gigawatt-hours, HH = households, kWh = kilowatt-hour, WTP = willingness to pay. \na  Generation variation according to Institute of Energy simulation of the whole Viet Nam system. \nb  Cost variation is a result of component analysis. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation using @RISK and estimates. \n \n19.

The analysis was based on the ADB ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) assessment paper, prepared for the 2007\u20132010 country strategy and program, \nas well as on the calculation of the flow of foreign exchange from the Mong Duong 1 project. \nThis analysis shows that the Mong Duong 1 investment does not alter the debt sustainability of \nthe country in the medium to long term, because the disbursement of the loan is within the \nannual  OCR  limit.  Further,  since  more  than  70%  of  ADB  loan  will  be  awarded  under  an \nengineering, procurement, and construction contract, the Project will not have significant effects \non supply or consumer sectors, and thus does not suggest excessive domestic inflation. Finally, \nMong Duong 1 will generate sufficient revenue to repay its associated loans. The detailed \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nF.  Conclusion6 \n21.  This analysis demonstrates that the demand for electricity between 2005 and 2025 is \nexpected to grow quickly, especially in the northern region where Mong Duong 1 is to be \nconstructed. The analysis also shows that Mong Duong 1 is part of a vigorously planned \nschedule of capacity addition. Mong Duong 1 is scheduled to be added to the grid in 2011. The \neconomic robustness of Mong Duong 1 has been confirmed by economic valuation of costs and \nbenefits of the Project, with extensive sensitivity analysis. The Project yields an expected EIRR \nof 22.5% and corresponding NPV of $846.6 million over the project life of 30 years (the base \nvalues of EIRR and NPV are 23.5% and $888 million, respectively). \n \n                                                 \n6  This is a short version of the economic analysis. Full details of the analysis showing mathematical equations and \ncalculations are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT \n \nA.  General  \n1.  The financial evaluation of the Project has been carried out in real terms. The project \ncost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by \nremoving the effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \n \nB.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n2.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  over  30  years  (5-year \nconstruction period plus 25 years of operations) on an after-tax basis. The plant output is \nestimated to be 6,000 gigawatt-hour (GWh) at a plant factor of 68% and a self-consumption of \n9%. The energy output is valued at $0.041 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) based on the prevailing \nprices for power procured from independent power producers (IPP).  \n \n3.  The project is assumed to purchase coal at $26 per ton at the time of commissioning \n(2012). Coal prices are expected to increase to $40 per ton in real terms (excluding price \nincrease due to inflation) as the price distortions in the domestic market gradually are removed, \ncoal prices net of inflation increase due to resource constraints. The cost of limestone is at $6 \nper ton, freshwater at $0.08 per cubic meter (m3), and fuel oil at $215 per ton are assumed to be \nconstant over the life of the Project. The operation and maintenance cost is assumed to be \n2.5% of the capital cost. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) calculation is in Table A11.1. \n \nTable A11.1: FIRR Calculation ($ million) \n \nYear  Capital  Inflow  Operating  Pre-Tax  Tax  Post-Tax \nInvestment  Cost  Cash Flow  Adjustment  Cash Flow \n2008  (27.0)  0.0  0.0  (27.0)  0.0  (27.0) \n2009  (151.3)  0.0  0.0  (151.3)  0.0  (151.3) \n2010  (280.0)  0.0  0.0  (280.0)  0.0  (280.0) \n2011  (262.3)  0.0  0.0  (262.3)  0.0  (262.3) \n2012  (133.6)  0.0  (0.0)  (133.6)  0.0  (133.6) \n2013  (90.7)  111.9  (60.4)  (39.2)  0.0  (39.2) \n2014  0.0  223.9  (110.7)  113.2  1.0  112.2 \n2015  (15.0)  223.9  (115.3)  93.6  0.7  92.9 \n2016  0.0  223.9  (120.0)  103.9  0.3  103.6 \n2017  0.0  223.9  (124.8)  99.1  0.0  99.1 \n2018  0.0  223.9  (129.9)  94.0  0.0  94.0 \n2019\u20132036  0.0  223.9  (134.4)  89.5  0.0\u201322.7  89.4\u201367.4 \n( ) = negative, FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nNote: FIRR = 6.59% \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n4.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been calculated in real terms based \nupon the capital composition in Table A11.2. \nTable A11.2: Capital Composition ($ million) \nFinancing Plan     % of Financing \nADB Loan  930.7  84.6 \nEquity  168.9  15.4 \nTotal Project Cost  1,099.6  100.0 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  59 \n5.  The cost of foreign debt has been calculated based on (i) the 5-year London inter-bank  \nswap rate of 5.58% plus Asian Development Bank\u2019s spread of 60 basis points, (ii) lending fee of \nMinistry of Finance of 20 basis points, (iii) an income tax rate of 28% per year, and (iv) an \ninternational inflation rate of 2.4% per year. On this basis, the cost of foreign debt has been \ncomputed to be 2.1% in real terms. \n \n6.  The opportunity cost of equity in Viet Nam, in real terms, has been calculated in Table \nA11.3. \nTable A11.3: Opportunity Cost of Equity \nCurrent interest rate on 10-year bond  8.5% \nPlus term premium  1.3% \nPlus risk premium  2.2% \nFinancial cost of equity in nominal terms  12.0% \nLess average domestic inflation rate  5.0% \nFinancial cost of equity in real terms  7.0% \n     Source: Asian Development Bank \n \n7.

The FIRR of the Project after tax is 6.59%, which exceeds the WACC of 2.85%. The net \npresent value of the after-tax cash flows, when discounted at WACC, is $427 million. \n \nD.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n9.  A  number  of  scenarios  were  tested  to  determine  the  sensitivity  to  some  variables, \nincluding (i) a 10% reduction in selling price, (ii) a 10% increase in coal prices, (iii) a 10% \nreduction in energy production, (iv) a 10% reduction in tariff and 10% increase in coal price; and \n(v) a 10% reduction in energy output and 10% reduction in heat rate.

Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR will exceed the WACC under single-\nevent  adverse  circumstances.  Given  the  overall  objectives  of  the  Project,  the  financial \nperformance  is  deemed  acceptable,  and  the  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \nsustainable. \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Preparation of Resettlement Plan and Resettlement Framework \n \n1.  A resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared for components with available preliminary \ndesigns: (i) thermal power plant, (ii) workers\u2019 site, (iii) cooling water intake channel, (iv) cooling \nwater discharge channel, and (v) ash pond. A resettlement framework (RF) has been prepared \nto cover the proposed reservoir, which EVN recently identified and for which no technical design \nis available. The RF sets out the resettlement policy, and screening and planning procedures.   \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  Land acquisition requirements have been minimized by locating the Mong Duong 1 \nThermal Power Plant on a site at the mouth of the Mong Duong River. The area is being used \nfor coal transport and storage, and has been modified heavily from its natural state with earth \nmoving, areas of fill, and changes to waterways and hydrological conditions. The project area is \nalso generally hilly and forest-covered.  \n \n3.  Based on the census, inventory of losses, and socioeconomic surveys, the RP estimates \nthat the Project will require the permanent acquisition of about 168 hectares (ha) of land. Most \nof the affected area is forestry land (83 ha), fish ponds (61 ha), and industrial land (20 ha). The \nresettlement  planning  and  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)1 identified  the  following \nresettlement impacts:  \n(i)  37 households (118 people) will be affected, of which 32 (96 people) will be required \nto relocate, and five will be marginally affected and able to remain on the same plot \nof land; \n(ii)  eight coal transportation companies and one forestry company will be required to \nmove;  \n(iii)  one construction company will be partially affected; \n(iv)  four large farm owners (timber, fishpond, and fruit trees) will be severely affected as \nalmost all their land will be acquired; and  \n(v)  employees  of  farm  owners  (80)  and  companies  (306)  might  lose  their  jobs \ntemporarily  during  the  transition  period  when  the  companies  reorganize  their \nactivities, or permanently if their employers cannot find replacement land and are \nunable to retain them. \n \n4.  In addition, the Project might affect fisherfolk. Based on the EIA Report, the construction \nphase will adversely affect 13 fishing households and one aquaculture company in Mong Duong \nRiver (Mong Duong Ward), as all fish and other aquatic habitat will be destroyed in the delta of \nthe Mong Duong River due to river diversion. The affected households include five that rely \ncompletely and eight that rely partially on fisheries for their livelihood. The natural aquatic \necosystem of the river is expected to take about 2 years to be restored in the new realigned \nmouth  of  the  river.  During  the  operation  phase,  particularly  in  the  discharge  channel,  an \nincrease in the temperature due to the thermal effluent will alter the ecosystem and biological \nproductivity of the De Dach estuary and near the ocean outfall at Cam Hai commune. The \nimpacts on fisheries, decline of fish captures (including sand worms), loss of income, etc., can \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006, Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Mong Duong Thermal Power Generation. \nManila (TA 4670-VIE, Marine Aquatic Resources Study, part of Environmental Impact Assessment Study).   \n ", "  Appendix 12  61 \nbe assessed only during operation through a monitoring program. A rapid response mechanism \nwill be established.2 \n \nC.  Policy Framework  \n 5.  The policy framework and entitlements of the Project have been based on a variety of \nViet Nam\u2019s laws and ADB\u2019s policies. The relevant Government laws are principally (i) the 1993 \nLand Law, amended in 1998, 2001, and 2003; (ii) Decree 197/CP (2004), modified in 2006, on \nCompensation, Support and Resettlement when land is recovered by the state; and (iii) Circular \n116 (2004) on guiding the implementation of Decree 197. The framework is rooted in ADB\u2019s \npolicies  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  Gender  and \nDevelopment  (1998),  Accountability  (2003),  and  Public  Communications  (2005).  With  the \npromulgation of Decree 197/CP (2004) and Decree 17/2006, the Government\u2019s policy and legal \nframework  towards  resettlement  moved  much  closer  to  the  principles  underpinning  ADB\u2019s \npolicies. However, in case of discrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and \nprocedures and ADB's policies and requirements, ADB's policies and requirements will prevail.  \nThis is also in accordance with Decree 17/2001, which stipulates that for Official Development \nAssistance-financed projects, funding agencies\u2019 policies apply. \n \nD.  Project Entitlements \n \n6.  The  Project  entitlements  were  designed  to  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation  for  all  losses  to  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all  affected  persons.  \nSeverely affected persons, as well as the poor and vulnerable, will be provided with livelihood \nstabilization assistance and income-restoration programs.   \nTable A12: Project Entitlements \nImpacts  Entitlements \nPermanent Acquisition  For  land  that  will  be  used  permanently,  as  a  priority,  replacement  land  or  cash \nof Land and Fishponds  compensation at replacement cost (i.e., current market value, productive value, and \nsimilar location attributes). Compensation will be provided to men and women. \nStructures, Crops, and  All legal owners of houses and structures will be paid based on current market prices of \nTrees  (irrespective of  materials  and  labor  with  no  deduction  for  depreciation  or  salvageable  materials.  \ntenure status)  Unharvested crops will be compensated based on current market value, while trees will be \npaid for based on type, age, and productive capacity. \nCommunity Buildings,  Repair or restoration to original or better conditions of affected community buildings and \nPublic Infrastructure and  infrastructure at no cost to community; or placement, if necessary, at locations identified in \nFacilities   consultation with affected communities and relevant authorities, at no cost to community; \nor cash compensation at replacement cost for affected community assets. \nLoss of Income from  For unregistered businesses, cash compensation for the duration of business and/or \nBusiness and Income  income generation that is disrupted based on the minimum wage per month in the \nSources (temporary)  province. For registered businesses, cash compensation for the duration of business and \nincome generation that is disrupted based on net income. For employees (men and \nwomen farmers and company workers), cash compensation for wages for each month \nthey cannot work. For men and women fisherfolk relying partially (secondary source of \nincome)  on  Mong  Duong  River  (affected  during  construction  of  river  diversion), \ncompensation for lost income based on average net income from fishing for 6 months or \nlonger depending on the duration of the temporary impacts.  \nLoss of Job (temporary  For temporary loss of job: (i) cash compensation for lost salary and wages for each month \nor permanent) for  a person cannot work; and (ii) assistance in securing new employment. For permanent \nEmployees Farm and  loss of job: (i) cash compensation for 6 months salary and wages, or cash compensation \nCoal Companies  for the remaining period of contract, whichever is higher; (ii) assistance in securing new \nemployment;  and  (ii)  assistance  for  livelihood  stabilization  and  livelihood  restoration \n                                                 \n2 Impact cannot be determined during the EIA due to lack of information on the standing volume of the effluent stream \nin the channel (i.e., heat dilution capacity). \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \n \nImpacts  Entitlements \nprograms. \nLoss of Income from  For unregistered businesses, cash compensation for 12 months based on the minimum \nBusiness and  wage per month in the province, and assistance to develop alternative livelihood. For \n(Permanent)  registered businesses, cash compensation for 12 months based on net income, and \nassistance to develop alternative livelihood. For men and women fisherfolk relying mainly \non Mong Duong River and De Dach estuary, cash compensation for 12 months or longer \nbased on average net income from fishing.   \nDisruption and  All relocating households will receive materials transport allowance from D3 million to D5 \nInconvenience During  million per household, according to the actual need. \nPhysical Relocation  \nSeverely Affecteda  In addition to payment for assets and/or lost income, livelihood stabilization allowance \nHouseholds, Poor and  (equivalent to 30 kilograms of rice per family member per month from 6 months to 12 \nVulnerable Households,  months); assistance for occupational change or enhancement (training); and livelihood \nand Cam Hai Commune  restoration programs, such as project-related employment opportunities, access to credit, \nResidentsb  agricultural extension, and development of alternate livelihoods for men and women \nfisherfolk who can no longer fish. \nTemporary Impacts   Payment of rent for the use of land during temporary use.

Return of land to pre-project \nconditions or better. \na Households losing 10%or more of their total productive (income generating) assets, company and farm workers \nlosing jobs permanently, severely affected men and women fisher folks, and relocating households, relocating \nhouseholds with businesses.  \nb Livelihood restoration program has been budgeted separately to be carried out for Cam Hai residents during Project \nimplementation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability, and Gender Issues \n \n7.  As no ethnic minority group has been found in the discharge channel, an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan or ethnic minorities specific actions are required for this Project. Special \nattention will be given to identifying and addressing any special needs of other vulnerable \ngroups, such as the landless, the poor, women-headed households, the disabled, and war \nveterans. This will be carried out through separate consultations for men and women, and by \nensuring that they benefit from the socioeconomic programs to be implemented under the \nProject.  A  gender  strategy  is  prepared  for  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \n(Appendix  13),  and  is  included  in  the  RP  and  RF.  The  project  supervision  consultants, \nindependent  monitoring  organization,  and  the  organization  that  will  plan  and  implement \nlivelihood restoration programs will ensure that the gender strategy is implemented.  \n \nF.  Resettlement and Income Restoration Strategies \n \n8.  Households that have to relocate will participate in identifying and selecting options for \ngovernment assistance to (i) relocate on their existing plot, (ii) move to group or individual \nrelocation  sites,  or  (iii)  receive  cash  compensation  and  make  their  own  arrangements  for \nrelocation. If any businesses have to relocate, they will be assisted in finding viable new sites. \nHouseholds that are severely affected through the loss of 10% or more productive assets will be \nassisted in purchasing replacement land, increasing productivity on their remaining land, or \nlearning new income-generating skills through the livelihood restoration programs and project-\nrelated job opportunities. Severely affected fisherfolk and workers will also be supported through \na livelihood restoration program and project-related job opportunities. Although impacts on \nfisheries  in  the  discharge  channel  (Cam  Hai  Commune)  can  be  determined  only  during \noperation, based on water quality and fisheries monitoring and comparison against a baseline \nthat will be established during project implementation, alternate livelihood programs will be \n ", "  Appendix 12  63 \nprovided during project implementation to prepare them for possible loss of fisheries income \nduring operation.  \n \nG.  Participation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n \n8.  Between January 2006 and March 2006, key stakeholders participated in, and were \nconsulted regarding, the preparation for the RP. These stakeholders included the (i) People\u2019s \nCommittees of affected provinces, districts, and towns; (ii) affected households and companies; \n(iii) relevant Government agencies; and (iv) social organizations. A workshop was held in Cam \nPha Town to present the Project\u2019s potential impacts, ADB\u2019s policies, proposed entitlements, \ninstitutional arrangements, and project schedule. This was followed by a stakeholder meeting in \nMong Duong Ward. The concerns and suggestions provided by the affected persons during the \nworkshops and public meetings then were incorporated in the RP. In addition, copies of public \ninformation  booklets  were  distributed  to  the  affected  persons.  Resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation will continue to follow the Project\u2019s participatory approach. Further consultations \nand stakeholder participation are to be carried out during project implementation.   \n \n9.  A grievance mechanism will be established to ensure that affected persons\u2019 concerns \nand grievances are addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. Affected \npersons will be made fully aware of their rights verbally and in writing during consultation, \nsurvey, and at the time of compensation. During RP planning, the affected persons were made \naware of ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism Policy by providing copies of the accountability field \nguide, which has been translated into Vietnamese. The Thermal Power Project Management \nUnit 1 (TPMMU1) and resettlement committees will be responsible for the disclosure of the draft \nand final resettlement planning documents to the affected persons. ADB will upload the draft \nand final resettlement planning documents on ADB\u2019s resettlement Web site. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  Resettlement committees will be established at the provincial, district, and commune \nlevels, as required by Decree 197/CP (2004). These will be under the responsibility of TPPMU1, \nwhich will take on the responsibilities of a project management unit. Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) \nand TPPMU1 have limited experience in preparing and implementing resettlement activities in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements.  Project  supervision  consultants  will  be \nengaged for supervision and capacity building to ensure the effective implementation of land \nacquisition and resettlement. The project supervision consultants, comprising one international \nresettlement specialist, one national resettlement specialist, and one national gender specialist, \nwill be recruited and mobilized before any resettlement activities start (i.e., before detailed \nmeasurement survey or DMS). A livelihood and community development specialist will also be \nrecruited  as  part  of  the  resettlement  team  to  assist  in  the  design  and  implementation  of \nlivelihood restoration programs; and to work closely with the fisheries specialist (part of the EIA \nteam)  to  determine  the  impacts  on  fisheries,  and  to  recommend  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures in close consultation with affected people. \n \nI.  Monitoring  \n \n11.  TPPMU1 will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities. Progress \nreports will be submitted to ADB quarterly. One agency and institution specializing in social \nsciences, which will be known as the Independent Monitoring Agency (IMA), will be recruited \nand  mobilized  before  any  resettlement  activities  start.  The  IMA  will  be  required  to  submit \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \n \nquarterly  reports  on  the  progress  of  implementation,  and  make  any  necessary \nrecommendations regarding the issues identified.   \n \nJ.  Cost Estimates \n \n12.  A replacement cost survey for land and other assets was carried out during resettlement \nplanning.  The  total  cost  for  resettlement  is  estimated  at  $3.6  million,  which  covers  (i) \ncompensation costs and allowances, (ii) design and implementation of livelihood restoration \nprograms, (iii) consulting, (iv) management and implementation costs, and (v) contingencies.  \nThese sums, however, might change at the time of the DMS to take into account actual losses, \nas well as any changes in prices that might have occurred between the preparation of the RP \nand its implementation. The Government will ensure timely provision of counterpart funds for \nresettlement, and will meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the RP budget to satisfy \nresettlement objectives.  \n \nK.  Implementation Schedule \n \n13.  The RP will be updated by component following detailed design. It will be disclosed to \naffected persons before submission to ADB for review and approval. All resettlement activities \nwill be coordinated with the civil works schedule. Civil works contractors will not be issued a \nnotice of possession of site for a particular component until (i) compensation and relocation of \naffected persons to new sites have been completed satisfactorily; and (ii) agreed rehabilitation \nassistance  is  in  place  for  a  particular  component,  and  that  component  is  free  of  all \nencumbrances. Land acquisition and relocation of affected persons cannot begin until ADB \nreviews and approves the updated RP. \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  65 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Viet Nam: \n \nIn recent years, strong economic growth in Viet Nam resulted in substantial demand for electricity throughout the \ncountry. The link between economic development and power demand is strong. The demand for electricity has \nincreased  about  15%  per  year  over  2000-2005.  High  demand  for  electricity  has  been  triggered  by  ongoing \nelectrification in new areas, expansion of transmission and distribution network, and an increase in industrial demand \nin line with the development of new industrial zones and enterprises throughout the country. The rapid economic \ngrowth has contributed to Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the share of the population living in poverty from 58% \nin 1993 to 24.1% in 2004. Poverty reduction has been a result of rapid, stable, and inclusive economic growth. The \nGovernment\u2019s aim is to maintain economic growth of 7.5% per year until 2010, and to reduce poverty incidence to 10\u2013\n11% by 2010. However, Viet Nam is facing a growing electricity supply deficit. A reliable and sufficient amount of \nelectricity supply is important for economic growth and poverty reduction. To address this electricity deficit, and to \nimprove the quality and reliability of electricity supply to industrial, rural, commercial, and residential consumers in Viet \nNam, 12,000 megawatts (MW) of new generating capacity is planned. About half of this planned additional capacity \n(6,000 MW) will be generated from coal-fired power plants. With other energy generation sources, the proposed \nProject can help meet the economy\u2019s increasing demand for electrical power from 2010 on, and can minimize the \ncountry\u2019s dependence on imported power. At the regional level, the Project can meet the demand of the economic \ntriangle of Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong\u2013Quang Ninh. At the provincial level, the Project will use local coal supply and promote \nthe development of industries\u2014coal mining and limestone quarrying\u2014thereby creating jobs for local residents.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nFollowing Asian Development Bank\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as \ngeneral intervention no longer require project-level poverty assessment. The following is a brief description of the \naffected people, and the likely impact of the Project. The project site is in one ward (Mong Duong) and two communes \n(Duong Huy, Cam Hai). All the affected households in the project area are Kinh. The Project does not affect any ethnic \nminority households. Economic activities in the project area vary by location. Coal mining, shipbuilding, cement \nproduction, fisheries, and seafood processing are the main activities of Cam Pha town, while coal industry is the main \ndriver of the economy for Mong Duong ward. The economy in the project area relies mainly on forestry and various \nindustries, rather than agriculture. Tree plantation for timber, aquaculture, and fisheries are the main sources of \nincome at the commune level.  \n \nThe main project impacts are loss of jobs; land acquisition (refer to resettlement plan); and loss of forest, mangrove, \nand aquatic resources (refer to the environmental impact assessment). The Project will acquire forest plantation land \nfrom forest plantation cooperatives. Large land owners own the cooperatives, which have permanent wage workers. \nSimilarly, land from a big aquaculture pond will be acquired. The Mong Duong power plant will negatively impact the \nwater quality and biological resources of marine coastal environment. The diversion of Mong Duong River and cooling \nwater discharge channel to Cam Hai commune would have adverse affect on fishery and mangroves (refer to EIA). \nThe resettlement plan, gender strategy, and environment management plan of the Project include strategies to \naddress these impacts on the local environment and livelihood of the people. \n \nHealth. Coal mining in Cam Pha Town has been polluting the air and environment through discharge of wastewater, \ndust etc. The widespread diseases in the project area related to pollution are (i) respiratory problems, (ii) lung disease, \nand (iii) eyes and nose infection. In Mong Duong, 68% of children suffer from respiratory diseases, and 50% suffer \nfrom nose and eyes infections. These diseases are linked mainly to the coal dust generated by coal transportation. A \nsubstantial proportion of the coal mine workers have contracted silicosis. VINACOAL has a program to give its most \nseverely affected workers access to silicosis treatment. Coal dust-related health problems of local people might \nincrease because of additional dust generated by the Project. During project implementation, occupational health \nmeasures will be developed to minimize health problems related to coal dust pollution for the workers. \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \n \nHIV/AIDS data indicates significant incidence in Cam Pha town. Some cases of HIV are reported in Mong Duong \nward. The project province, Quang Ninh, has 133 kilometre (km) of national border with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, with international border gates and unofficial crossroads through which goods and people traverse every day. \nIn addition, the province has a 250 km sea border, which allows various forms of marine moving, including human \ntrafficking. During construction, camps for construction workers and offices will be established in the project sites. A \nworkforce of 4,500 is expected on site during construction. The labor camp will be set up near to the project sites. In \naddition, permanent workers camps will be established for the Mong Duong project. The presence of large number \nlabor camps in pre- and post-construction phases poses a potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the \nproject area. In the project province, government and nongovernment organizations (NGO) have been engaged in \nimplementing HIV/AIDS and human trafficking-related programs. From January 1999 to February 2003, Quang Ninh \nprovincial police dealt with 91 cases of human trafficking. From January 2005, the International Organization of \nMigration, in partnership with the Women\u2019s Union, implemented an 18-month Counter Trafficking Project in Quang \nNinh Province, Viet Nam. A national program on AIDS is implemented in the province. In addition, several NGOs are \npresent in Cam Pha, and have programs to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \nUnder the proposed Project, HIV/AIDs and human trafficking awareness program will be undertaken during pre- and \npost-construction phases in the project area. The experience and lessons from the existing program in the province \nwill be incorporated in designing the awareness program. In addition, the awareness program will be coordinated as \nappropriate with the existing programs of various agencies.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholder analysis as part of the consultation process was conducted at the commune and district level during \npreparation of the feasibility study of the Project.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project will emphasize participatory processes in implementing the resettlement plan, environmental impact \nassessment plan, occupational health action plan, and awareness program on human trafficking and HIV/AIDS. \nCommune-level resettlement committees will include representatives of affected people, mass organizations (women\u2019s \nunion, youth union), and relevant commune-level officials to address resettlement issues. The Government Decree 79 \n(Grassroots  Democracy)  encourages  community  participation.  The  commune-level  resettlement  committees  will \nfacilitate effective implementation of Decree 79. The occupational health and safety plan and awareness programs on \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking will facilitate active community involvement in implementing the activities (see gender \nstrategy below).  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn the project area, the main economic activities include forest plantation, fishery, and industry. Gender analyses \ninclude households affected by land acquisition and loss of fisheries. Women work in aquaculture and forest plantation \nas wage workers. In marine fishery, women accompany men out to sea, and they play significant role in all fishing \nactivities: catching fish, preparing nets, harvesting, cleaning, and selling fish. Women also are involved in white worm \ncollection in the coastal area. Women in the forest plantation are involved in planting, taking care of trees, and cutting \ntrees. In aquaculture, women are responsible for feeding fish and taking care of the pond. To ensure the participation \nwomen in project activities during implementation of the resettlement plan, as well as HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, \nand health-related programs, the following measures are included in the gender strategy: \n(i)  At project inception, a capacity building training program on resettlement activities will be designed for \nwomen and men commune officials, and women and men from affected households. The training will \nalso include representatives from line agencies, and representatives from the commune Women\u2019s Union \nand  Youth  Union  involved  in  resettlement  committees.  The  training  will  include  information  on \nresettlement activities, compensation, and the impact of the Project on livelihood activities related to the \nloss of jobs and fisheries. The objective of the training is to provide affected communities with an \nunderstanding resettlement issues and the environmental impact of the Project on fisheries, mangroves, \nand health. The training will facilitate effective implementation of the resettlement plan, and will help in \naddressing of environment-related impacts on livelihoods. \n ", "  Appendix 13  67 \n(ii)  The district resettlement committees will include women representatives from the district Women\u2019s \nUnion. Commune-level resettlement committees will include the commune Women\u2019s Union and Youth \nUnion to represent the interests of women in the affected households to assist resettlement activities.  \n(iii)  Separate consultations will be held with the men and women workers from the forest plantation, coal \ncompanies, aquaculture industry, and households regarding compensation and deployment in forest \nplantation and aquaculture industry in another location. Project monitoring will include information on \ndeployment of women workers. Similarly, separate consultation will be held with men and women from \nfisherfolk households to determine relevant compensation for loss of fisheries and developing fish culture \nand plantation of mangrove-related activities. \n(iv)  Specific attention will be given to complaints and grievances by women.  \n(v)  Thermal Power Project Management Unit 1 will create a specific awareness activities for men and \nwomen workers about occupational health issues linked to the power plant project. Occupational health \nand safety awareness will include identification of gender-related occupation health issues and safety \nmeasures.  \n(vi)  TPPMU1 will conduct an HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking awareness campaign involving communities \nduring project construction and implementation. Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union, health workers, female \ncommunity leaders and members, and women from affected households will be involved in implementing \nthe campaign. \n(vii)  As per the Labor Code (as amended in 2002), all employment for the Project will respect Government \ncommitments  to  gender  equity,  including  (i)  deployment  of  women  workers  in  forest  plantation, \naquaculture industry, and coal companies; (ii) ensuring that no child will be used; and (iii) ensuring the \nsame wages are paid to men and women for work of equal value. \n(viii)  The Executing Agency will create a specific occupational health and safety awareness training program \nfor men and women workers. A gender-related occupation health and safety management system will be \nestablished. The Health and Safety Committee will include women representatives as members. \n(ix)  Gender sensitization training related to resettlement and occupational health will be provided for relevant \nstaff from the Electricity of Vietnam, TPPMU1, and resettlement committees.   \n(x)  A national consultant on social development and gender will be included in the consulting services for \nthe implementation of the gender strategy. The terms of reference for the social development and \ngender consultants are included in the consulting services. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nYes, a gender strategy has been prepared (see above) \n \n ", "68  Appendix 13 \n \n \n \nE.
