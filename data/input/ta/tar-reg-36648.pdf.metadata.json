Chang,  Principal \nEducation Specialist, MKSS (Team Leader) and K. Emzita, Counsel, OGC. ", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  Human resource development (HRD) thrusts in the Greater Mekong Subregion1 (GMS) \nwere recently examined during the Eleventh Ministerial Conference in September 2002 in light of \nthe  progress  in  implementing  the  GMS  strategic  framework.  The  framework  guides  GMS \ncooperation in the 10 years until 2011 through 5 strategic thrusts and 11 flagship programs. The \nsupport for a more proactive approach to GMS cooperation in HRD highlighted, among others, \nefforts to prevent the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome (HIV/AIDS) and the promotion of information and communication technology (ICT). In \nparticular, the proactive approach supported a project for HIV/AIDS prevention in cross-border \nareas of GMS. The project dovetails with the urgency of reducing poverty and is supportive of the \nMillennium Development Goal of halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015.  \n2.  Preventive education for HIV/AIDS has both short- and long-term impacts on preventing \nand controlling HIV/AIDS. Two strategies are used in preventive education: (i) integration of \nHIV/AIDS concepts in the school curriculum; and (ii) application of  extracurricular activities such as \nyouth camps, peer education, exhibits, contests, and counseling services. Multisectoral initiatives \noutside of the formal education system are also needed to deliver life-skills-based preventive \neducation (i) to ethnic minorities, girls, and women through community-based formal and nonformal \neducation; and (ii) to adult learners through distance learning. Other strategies include promoting \ncondom use and other safe sex practices. Preventive education is appropriate since it aims to \ndevelop life skills, skills in decision making, negotiation, communication, which will enable the \nyouth to protect themselves. \n3.  A technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission was fielded on 28 July-6 August 2002 to \ndiscuss the objectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements of the Project \nwith representatives from 5 developing member countries (DMCs) and officers of the Southeast \nAsian  Ministers  of  Education  Organization  (SEAMEO)  and  the  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Opening the GMS borders to tourism and trade has increased the flow of populations \nacross the borders for trade and employment and has major implications for both the epidemiology \nand prevention of HIV/AIDS. Two of the top 10 countries ni   Asia  with  the  highest  HIV/AIDS \nprevalence rates are in GMS, i.e., Cambodia and Thailand. Viet Nam is experiencing high HIV \ninfection rates among some population groups like users of injected drugs and sex workers. The \nborder areas between these DMCs and with Yunnan Province of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(henceforth, mention of DMCs in this paper includes Yunnan Province) are porous and function as \nconduits for high population mobility, trade, and services. Regional economic cooperation has \nhastened these cross-border processes dramatically. The problem of HIV/AIDS is related to drug \nabuse and sex work? phenomena that are associated with cross-border traffic. The majority of the \npopulation are poor and highly vulnerable to infection with and spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n5.  About 21 million people from ethnic groups live among the 240 million people in the GMS. \nMany  of  them  are  in  remote  mountainous  terrain,  with  relatively  poor  social  and  physical \ninfrastructure. These minority peoples, especially the women, are at risk because of lack of access \nto education and health care, poverty, lack of culturally appropriate information in their own \nlanguages,  cultural  and  social  breakdown  within  some  communities,  nontraditional  drug  use, \nhuman trafficking, and involvement in the sex trade. The potential use of ICT in education and \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC, specifically Yunnan Province), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 2002. ", "2   \nhealth  for  targeting  HIV/AIDS  has  not  been  adequately  explored.  This  is  due  to  lack  of \ninfrastructure,  hardware  and  software,  and  trained  personnel,  and  to  very  limited  financial \nresources.  \n6.  The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has raised more than $2 billion to \ndate and has awarded a total of $378 million over 2 years to 40 projects in 31 countries (including \nall GMS countries) during the first round of grants. More than 70% of the funds support HIV/AIDS \nprograms. However, there is still a huge deficit in the resources needed. It is estimated that around \n$10 billion is needed yearly to fight AIDS alone. \n \n7.  UNESCO\u2019s Asia and Pacific Regional Bureau for Education in Bangkok covers 44 countries \nof the Asia and Pacific region, including the six DMCs in GMS. UNESCO\u2019s work with HIV/AIDS \ninvolves intersectoral participation in: (i) developing effective and socially and culturally relevant \nmaterials to increase the impact of preventive education on the transmission of HIV/AIDS; (ii) \nensure that children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are allowed to participate in inclusive \neducational environments that meet their needs; and (iii) reduce the impact of the AIDS pandemic \non education systems and schools, learners and learning. SEAMEO was established in 1965 as a \nchartered  international  organization  for  promoting  regional  cooperation  in  education,  science, \ntechnology,  and  culture.  It  has  10  member  states,  six  associate  country  members,  and  a \nsecretariat based in Bangkok. SEAMEO\u2019s educational programs and activities are carried out by \n15 autonomous regional centers. Three of them  \u2013 the regional centers for Tropical Medicine \nNetwork (TROPMED Network), Educational Innovation and Technology (INNOTECH), and Open \nLearning Center (SEAMOLEC) \u2013 will be among the implementing agencies for the Project.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  development  goals  are  (i)  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  infection  among \nvulnerable age groups and poor and marginalized population groups, and (ii) to expand the use of \nICT and other multimedia technologies in HIV/AIDS preventive education. The objectives of the \nProject  are  to  (i)  develop  ICT  learning  materials  for  HIV/AIDS  preventive  education  in  local \nlanguages; (ii) build the capacities of teachers, health workers, multimedia providers, and other \nstakeholders  for  HIV/AIDS  preventive  education;  (iii)  expand  the  use  of  ICT  interventions  in \nHIV/AIDS preventive education; and (iv) deliver ICT-based interventions to isolated, marginalized, \nand vulnerable populations.  \n9.  The Project will seek to achieve increased awareness of and skills on how to prevent \ninfection among the more vulnerable groups by: (i) training teachers in using ICT-based learning \nmaterials and preventive education efforts in schools; (ii) a strategy of decentralized development \nof materials down to the provincial/district level; (iii) developing and disseminating educational \nradio programs and audio tapes; (iv) systematically collecting, storing, and repackaging innovative \neducation materials in an expanded clearinghouse3 of information and materials support; (v) \nestablishing a geographic information system (GIS); and (vi) direct and targeted interventions \namong special and interstitial4 populations, in collaboration with community-based organizations \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n10.  The Project will bring together the expertise, knowledge base, and comparative advantages \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB),  SEAMEO, and UNESCO. UNESCO will supplement its \n                                                 \n3  The UNESCO-based clearinghouse on preventive HIV/AIDS education for Asia and the Pacific will be expanded and \nstrengthened through the targeted use of ICT to develop new teaching and learning materials. It will serve as a \nwarehouse and library of both hard and electronic copies of learning materials and a repository of best practices. \n4  That population that falls between those who have established permanent residency in a specific location/area and \nthose that are migrant, and move from home to work (e.g., across borders) constantly. ", "    3 \nexperience with that of Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS), and SEAMEO will \ndraw  mainly  on  the  experience  of  TROPMED,  INNOTECH,  and  SEAMOLEC.  The  expected \noutputs are analyses of the training needs of target groups, an operational plan for each border \narea and main activity, training curriculum, enhanced school curriculum, trained teachers and \ntrainors, documentation of best practices, new and repackaged education and multimedia learning \nmaterials, radio programs, linkages and networking among ICT-for-education/health players, a GIS \nmapping plan, and a web site incorporating HIV/AIDS preventive education resources.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The Project will target around 8,000 in-school youth (13-24-year-olds) through interventions \nin schools in high-risk cross border areas with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS; out-of-school youth \nand other special risk groups (e.g., truck drivers, sex workers, interstitial population), and source \ncommunities,  through  educational  radio-based  programming,  community-based  information \nprograms, community learning centers (CLCs), and peer education support to ICT programs. The \nschool and CLC setting will focus on schools and communities in the identified high-risk cross-\nborder  areas,  i.e.,  border  areas  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand;  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR) with Viet Nam and with Thailand; Yunnan with Viet Nam, Lao PDR; Viet Nam \nwith Lao PDR and Cambodia; and Thailand and Lao PDR. The Project will have four components: \n  1.  Learning Materials Development \n12.  Learning materials will be developed at provincial resource development centers and at the \nschool and CLC level to ensure that they are appropriate to local conditions and contexts. Around \n200 school teachers and community leaders in the project sites will be trained in developing and \nusing ICT-based learning materials. Materials developed specially for high- technology media are \ntargeted at the communities that are able to sustain the relevant technology. Educational radio \nprograms and audio tapes will be developed, tested and disseminated in the region where radio is \nthe primary tool for distribution. For sites with limited access to utilities and other facilities, other \nless advanced materials will be distributed. \n13.  All the materials developed will respond to the linked triad of problems: HIV/AIDS risk \nbehaviors, trafficking in girls and women, and drug abuse among highland minorities. Minority \ngroups will be involved and programs will be developed by native speakers in the local languages, \nrather than simply translated. These efforts will be undertaken in close cooperation with all partner \ninstitutions, the private sector, educational institutions, content developers as well as those who \nare responsible for disseminating materials \u2013 local TV stations, local radio stations (e.g., Radio \nThailand [Chiang Mai], Yunnan Provincial Radio [Kunming], Xishuangbanna Radio, Radio Lao), \nand web sites publishers.  \n  2.  Capacity Building \n14.  The Project will strengthen and develop community-based groups (e.g., youth and women\u2019s \ngroups, CLCs) in ethnic minority villages that can provide complementary and follow-up peer \neducation support to radio programs as well as to the school-based programs. It will build the \ncapacity of teachers, school administrators, scriptwriters, multimedia producers, and community \nmobilizers through hands-on training. The results of efforts in the school setting should likewise \nreach  and  benefit  the  whole  community  e.g.,  parents,  local  government  units,  religious \norganizations.  \n15.  A learning resource development team from each of the five participating DMCs will be \norganized and strengthened within an appropriate national or provincial educational institution. Two \nbenefits of such a strategy of building national/provincial capacity are helping to support the \nsustainability of project gains and providing an institutional base for future expansion of project \nactivities to other sites. In parallel, the Project will also build ICT infrastructure capacity by itself and ", "4   \nas a tool for preventive education. ICT hardware and software with accompanying training will be \nprovided to schools and CLCs, where appropriate, in the border areas. Strengthening in ICT \ncapability  (hardware  and  software)  will  also  be  undertaken  at  the  national  level.  The  GIS \ncomponent will strengthen the capacity to use both the GIS software and the outputs that can be \ngenerated for local use.  \n  3.  Program Delivery \n16.  Programs will be delivered through the school curriculum and activities, with teachers as \nchange agents and social advocates. The Project will support peer education where students \nthemselves take the initiative to effect behavior change among their peers under the guidance of \nteachers and counselors. The primary programming format for the educational radio broadcast is a \nsoap opera, using themes relevant to the lives of highland girls and young women and their \nfamilies, and highlighting the implications of the choices that they make. Drama and music in local \nlanguages will be used. Families are both direct and indirect targets of this approach and are seen \nas promoters of safe reproductive health. \n17.  Following the situational analysis that will be conducted at the start of the Project, direct and \ntargeted interventions will be developed in collaboration with community-based organizations and \nNGOs to reach those populations identified as most vulnerable and unreached by other preventive \neducation  efforts.  Developing  of  preventive  education  for  special  and  interstitial  populations \nrequires attention to both where they are located and when they move. Activities will be timed to \ntake advantage of movements of people during paydays, market days, festivals, and national \nholidays  that  favor  risk  behaviors.  Materials  prepared  and  tested  for  such  situations  will  be \nprovided to these groups with information and the means to protect themselves. The GIS mapping \nplan for this activity becomes something like a geographic calendar, allowing for better tracking of \nlinkages between areas with a high incidence of infection and the factors attracting people to them.  \n  4.  Database and Information Support \n18.  Project  activities  will  include  (i)  collecting,  processing,  disseminating,  and  sharing \ninformation and materials on HIV/AIDS, focusing on the needs of ethnic and linguistic minority \ngroups, and hard-to-reach and disadvantaged groups; (ii) reviewing, synthesizing, and repackaging \ninformation into forms and products tailored for segmented target audiences; (iii) expanding the \nexisting  database  of  information,  education,  and  communication  materials  on  HIV/AIDS  and \ncreating a project web site; (iv) providing information support and technical reference to the \nHIV/AIDS project for the Mekong subregion; and (v) promoting and advocating the use of these \nmaterials in other ADB-funded projects.5 \n \n19.  The primary components of the GIS include incidence and sentinel surveillance data, \nknown population distributions (by ethnicity and linguistic groupings), pertinent data related to \neducation,  migration,  and  transport  routes;  economic  zones,  mining  sites,  hot  spots,  border-\ncrossing locations; temporal events (traditional holidays, markets, temple fairs, social disruptions or \ndisplacements); localized data; information from the UNESCO-based clearinghouse materials, \nprogram and activity locations (and targets), ICT availability by type, extent of access or coverage, \nand all the other GIS data available from other agencies (economic data, school attendance, health \nindicators). The project will develop and improve systems and networking among participating \nDMCs as well as with ICT initiatives at the interregional level, and promote public-private sector \ncooperation, including NGOs.  \n                                                 \n5   Lessons learned and project design of recent RETAs have been taken into account in the design of the TA. These \nRETAs are (i) ADB. 1993. Regional Technical Assistance for Study on Economic Implications of HIV/AIDS Epidemic in \nSelected DMCs, Manila; (ii) ADB. 1997. Regional Technical Assistance for Cooperation in the Prevention and Control \nof HIV/AIDS in the GMS, Manila; and (iii) ADB. 1999. Regional Technical Assistance for Preventing HIV/AIDS Among \nMobile Populations in the GMS, Manila. ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n20.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $1.85 million equivalent, of which $1 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funded program. SEAMEO and UNESCO will provide \ncofinancing on a parallel basis in cash and kind in the amounts of $431,000 and $317,000, \nrespectively. The 5 DMCs are expected to contribute a total of around $100,000 in kind. Detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The Executing Agencies (EAs) for the Project will be UNESCO and SEAMEO, each with its \nown project management unit (PMU). Implementing agencies will be selected partners of UNESCO \nand the three SEAMEO regional centers. Country-level support will  be  provided  through  the \nUNESCO offices in Bangkok, Phnom Penh, and Hanoi; UNESCO national commissions in each \nDMC; SEAMEO country teams, as well as ministries of education and health in each DMC. Each \nparticipating DMC will designate focal points, normally in the Ministry of Education or the National \nAIDS Committee, for implementation of the TA.  A coordinating board comprising directors of \nUNESCO and SEAMEO and an ADB representative will provide policy guidance and oversight. \nProject  implementation  will  be  guided  by  a  steering  committee  comprising  members  of  the \ncoordinating board, directors/chiefs of implementing agencies, focal points/champions of DMCs, \nand  representatives  of  national  coordinating  bodies.  As  overall  focal  point,  an  administrative \nsecretariat will be housed at the UNESCO and SEAMEO headquarters in Bangkok and will provide \ngeneral logistic support. UNESCO and SEAMEO will be responsible for administering their own \ncontributions. \n22.  Implementation is envisaged over 18 months, starting in January 2003 and ending by June \n2004. A midterm review will be conducted around October 2003 at which time the envisaged phase \n2 project will be planned and formulated. The PMUs will prepare project progress reports (i) at the \nend  of  the  first  6  months  of  implementation;  (ii)  at  the  midterm  review;  and  (iii)  at  project \ncompletion, to be submitted to ADB within 1 month of the end of each period. \n23.  All procurement financed by ADB under the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  EAs  equipment  comprising  computers  and  peripherals  and \nassociated software, printers, scanners, digital cameras, CD writers, television sets, radios, office \nequipment, furniture, as well as supplies and consumables. These may be combined in one or two \npackages  and  procured  from  one  vendor  through  competitive  bidding.  However,  since  such \nequipment items are small and will be scattered across project sites in the five DMCs, it may be \nmore practical to have the equipment procured locally. On completion of the TA, the EAs will retain \nall equipment to be used in follow-up programs. \n24.  Four  international  consultants  (28  person-months)  will  be  recruited  individually  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  to  help  in  (i)  developing  and \nproducing radio programs and broadcasting them, preventing trafficking and drug use among \nhighland  minorities;  (ii)  GIS  support  activities;  and  (iii)  assessing  the  needs  of  special  and \ninterstitial  populations  and  peer  outreach  programs.  Consultants  will  be  based  in  Bangkok. \nConsulting services requirements and terms of reference are outlined in Appendix 3. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for \nICT  and  HIV/AIDS  Preventive  Education  in  the  Cross-Border  Areas  of  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
