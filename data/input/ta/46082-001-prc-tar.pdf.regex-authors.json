INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  conduct  a  study  on  modern \nagriculture demonstration area (MADA) planning and financial support mobilization. The TA is \nincluded  in  the  PRC  country  operations  business  plan  2012\u20132014.  ADB  fielded  a \nreconnaissance mission to Beijing on 12\u201313 March 2012 and held discussions with the Ministry \nof  Agriculture  (MOA)  to  clarify  and  agree  on  the  scope,  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements for the TA.1 The design and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. The TA will develop prototypes of MADA \nstrategic development plans and conduct a study on financial support to the construction of \nMADAs, taking into account successful international practices and experiences in agricultural \nmodernization, as well as achievements and ongoing interventions of ADB in the agriculture \nsector. The TA will also prepare a policy note to present important policy recommendations on \nstrategic  planning  and  financial  support  for  agricultural  modernization  through  the  MADA \napproach. The TA provides timely support to the PRC\u2019s transition toward more sustainable and \nbalanced growth, and is in line with ADB\u2019s sector priorities in the PRC: food security, rural \nlivelihood improvement, and sound management of land, water, and forest.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although agriculture has been developing fast and making substantial contributions to \nthe overall economic development of the PRC since 1978, agricultural production and rural \nlivelihoods  have  been  lagging  behind  industrial  production  and  urban  livelihoods.  The \nagricultural infrastructure is insufficient and fragile, technological development and adoption \nlevels are low, and constraints on natural resources and the environment intensify challenges to \nagricultural development. There is also an urgent demand for the sector to catch up on modern \ntechnology and business models to boost production scale, develop value chains, and improve \nproduct safety. Agricultural modernization is regarded as a fundamental way to ensure food \nsecurity,  develop  the  rural  economy,  and  close  the  gaps  between  rural  and  urban  areas. \nRecognizing the critical period that the sector has been entering, the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan \n(2011\u20132015)  sets  the  core  objectives  of  future  agricultural  development,  i.e.,  speeding  up \nagricultural development and raising the level of agricultural modernization and the farmers\u2019 \nliving standards. \n \n3.  Given the significant regional disparities in the levels of development and constraints \nacross  the  country,  a  one-size-fits-all  approach  to  agricultural  modernization  might  be \nunrealistic. A more practical strategy is to encourage and support those regions that have a \nbetter potential for modernizing their agriculture sector to move first, then set up models of \nagricultural modernization for the others to follow. Thus in 2009, MOA first proposed to establish \nMADAs as a platform, and as models, for developing modern agriculture and thereby improving \nproductivity and rural income.3  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 July 2012. \n2  ADB. 2012.

Guidance on Establishing and \nConstructing National Modern Agricultural Demonstration Areas. Beijing. \n ", "2   \n4.  Agricultural modernization is not a single-approach process. Development projects and \nstudies  on  this  topic  all  value  an  integrated  approach  to  achieving  this.4 For  instance, \nagricultural extension services and vocational training for farmers need to be strengthened \nwhen expanding irrigation infrastructure and promoting advanced agricultural technology; farmer \ncooperatives should be supported when widening access to markets and agricultural logistics. \nThe MADA initiative adopts this concept. Depending on local specialties and resources, each \nMADA may establish its own pathway to agricultural modernization through a combination of \napproaches, such as developing new agricultural development concepts and ideas, enhancing \nagricultural  infrastructure  facilities  and  equipment,  promoting  technological  extensions  and \nagricultural value chains, experimenting with new business models and industrial organization, \nand/or improving farmers\u2019 human capital. Thus, a comprehensive package of both structural and \nnonstructural interventions is apt to strengthen MADAs' infrastructure and equipment, as well as \nenable  an  institutional  and  organizational  environment  for  agricultural  modernization.  The \ninitiative  also  attaches  importance  to  the  possible  spillover  effects  that  the  MADAs  may \ngenerate, and to monitoring their performance. A MADA could lead the neighboring areas to \ndevelop  modern  agriculture  through  building  industrial  links,  spreading  technologies  and \ninformation, and improving human capital based on local needs.  \n \n5.  The National Modern Agricultural Development Plan (2011\u20132015), which was publicized \non 13 January 2012, states that 300 MADAs will be constructed from 2011 to 2015. Since \nAugust 2010, 153 counties, cities, and farm districts have been selected by local governments \nand approved by MOA to establish MADAs on the basis that these counties, cities, and farm \ndistricts have relatively advanced agriculture sectors, have advantages in producing major farm \nproducts, or serve large and medium-sized cities with agricultural supplies. It is hoped that these \nMADAs,  as  well  as  those  to  be  designated,  will  lead  the  transformation  toward  modern \nagriculture, generate significant spillover effects to their neighborhood, and promote nationwide \nagricultural modernization. Local governments are eager to host MADAs in their jurisdictions, \nand several have prepared a development plan for one and explored innovative ways to support \nits construction.  \n \n6.  MOA has identified two prerequisites for the early stage of the MADA campaign. First, \nthere  is  a  need  to  develop  prototypes  of  MADA  strategic  development  plans  through  a \nparticipatory  approach  that  reflects  stakeholders\u2019  consensus  on  modern  agriculture  and  to \ndefine the major MADA elements for different regions. The MADA development plans prepared \nby the local governments can be substantially improved based on MOA\u2019s assessment. While \nthe  specific  models  and  activities  for  each  MADA  will  depend  on  local  conditions,  the \ndevelopment plans should be consistent with national policies and cover the major aspects of \nconstructing  a  MADA,  e.g.,  access  to  resources,  institutional  innovations,  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation, and spillover effects on non-MADA regions.   \n \n7.  Second, since more investments are required to develop the MADAs, it is necessary to \nassess strategies for mobilizing financial resources and improving financial services for MADA \nconstruction.  Preliminary  estimates show  that each  MADA  would  require  an  investment of \n$150 million\u2013$600  million  to  achieve  agricultural  modernization.  While  public  investment \ncontinues to play a key role in financing the agriculture sector, the government\u2019s fiscal budget \nfor the development of MADAs is limited. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of \n                                                \n4  For example: ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Provincial Development \nStrategies for Two Northeastern Provinces. Manila (TA 7170-PRC); World Bank. Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural \nModernization  Project.  http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P065463/jiangxi-integrated-agricultural-modernization-\nproject?lang=en \n ", "  3 \npublic investment in the MADAs. Furthermore, there is great potential to mobilize other sources \nof  funding  (including  private  capital,  national  policy  lending,  and  funds  from  international \nfinancial  institutions)  to  support  MADA  construction.  Associated  with  the  lack  of  financial \nresources are poor financial services for the agriculture sector. Thus, there is a need to look into \nthe gaps between demand for credit and insurance and the constrained supply of financial \nservices to the MADAs, and to examine successful international experiences in financial support \nto agricultural modernization that may be applicable to the PRC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be improved rural livelihoods as indicated by an average annual increase \nof 7% in rural per capita net income by 2020. The outcome will be agricultural modernization. \nThis will be achieved through MOA\u2019s adoption of the prototypes of MADA strategic development \nplans and policy recommendations on mobilizing financial support for MADA construction.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  produce  three  main  outputs:  (i)  five  prototypes  of  MADA  strategic \ndevelopment plans, (ii) a report on financial support for the construction of MADAs, and (iii) a \npolicy note on strategic planning and financial support for agricultural modernization through the \nMADA  approach.  The  five  prototypes  of  MADA  strategic  development  plans  will  be \ngeographically representative while also taking into account those areas that have advantages \nin grain or commodity production, are in the vicinity of main cities, and host state-owned farms. \nThe  plans  will  cover  key  aspects  of  MADA  construction,  such  as  access  to  resources, \ninstitutional innovations, performance monitoring and evaluation, and generating spillovers to \nnon-MADA regions. The financial support study will look into the fiscal and non-fiscal resources \nthat a MADA could possibly tap. Non-fiscal resources include private capital, national policy \nlending, and financing from international development institutions. The study will also examine \nthe demand of MADAs for financial services (such as microcredit and insurance) and measures \nto strengthen financial services for MADA construction. The policy note will synthesize and \nhighlight the policy implications from the first two outputs and propose short- and long-term \npolicy options for agricultural modernization.  \n \n10.  For MOA to adopt and turn the TA outputs into official guidelines and policies, it is \nassumed that the MADAs will play a leading role in agricultural modernization and generate \nspillovers to the neighboring areas, and that the government will reach a policy consensus on \nboosting financial support to the development of modern agriculture. As a risk, however, failure \nin economic restructuring and reform may weaken financial support to agriculture and rural \ndevelopment. Efficient consultation and communication with government agencies on financial \npolicy and regulation will be conducted during TA implementation to seek timely guidance and \nto demonstrate the gaps between demand and supply of financial resources and services in the \nagriculture sector.  \n \n11.   Key activities to achieve the outputs include (i) conducting a comprehensive assessment \nof  literature  on  agricultural  modernization  and  rural  development,  agricultural  planning \nrequirements  and  policies,  national  policies  and  existing  local  MADA  development  plans; \n(ii) reviewing  and  drawing  relevant  lessons  from  international  experiences  on  agricultural \nmodernization and financial support for agriculture and rural development; (iii) conducting field \nvisits and consultations with stakeholders such as local governments, enterprises, and farmers \n ", "4   \nof MADAs; (iv) collecting and analyzing data on agricultural production, financial resources and \nservices, rural development, and other relevant fields of selected MADAs; (v) organizing an \ninternational  study  tour  to  selected  countries  where  successful  experiences  of  agricultural \nmodernization may be applicable to the PRC; and (vi) organizing TA workshops (inception, \ninterim,  and  final)  and  an  international  conference  to  present  and  discuss  the  framework, \nmethodology, and periodic results of the project, and to disseminate the  findings of the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, access to data sources, assistance to field \ntrips, use of office space and facilities, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.   MOA will be the executing agency. The Department of Development and Planning of \nMOA will be the implementing agency and will provide technical guidance and support. A TA \nmanagement office will be established in the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center of MOA, \nwhich will be responsible for planning and conducting the overseas study tour, organizing the \ninternational conference on modern agriculture development and MADA construction, and the \nday-to-day TA activities (including overseeing the TA consultants\u2019 work plans, coordinating \ndomestic  reviews  of  TA  outputs,  and  guiding  the  consultants  on  the  preparation  of  the \nworkshops and conference). The implementing agency will coordinate with national government \nagencies (such as the Ministry of Water Resources), financial policy and regulatory agencies, \nand local governments that host MADAs.   \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  partially  delegated  to  MOA.5 A  capacity  assessment  of  MOA  was \nconducted  in  2008  during  the  preparation  of  the  Integrated  Renewable  Biomass  Energy \nDevelopment Sector Project (currently administered by MOA).6 There have been no significant \nadverse changes to MOA's capacity since the assessment was completed. \n \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months,  tentatively  from  1  October  2012  to \n31 March  2014.  The  TA  requires  an  estimated  24  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising 4 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  a  national  agricultural  planning  specialist  and  team  leader,  a  national \nagricultural finance specialist, a national agricultural and rural development specialist, a national \nagricultural policy specialist, and an international agricultural economist. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The consultants will be engaged through a consulting firm by MOA, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time), using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  The  biodata \ntechnical proposal approach will be used to assess the qualifications of the bidding firms. The \n                                                \n5  Based on the memorandum of understanding on enhanced partnership on TA delegation to the executing agency \nbetween the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Finance and ADB signed in November 2009, the delegation is limited to the \nselection, recruitment, and supervision of consultants. The administration of the TA will remain with ADB. \n6  ADB. 2010.
