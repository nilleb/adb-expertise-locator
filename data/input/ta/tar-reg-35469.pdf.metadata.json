Common \nenvironmental problems include rapid deforestation and loss of biological diversity; destructive \nexploitation, and in some cases depletion of marine and mineral resources; degradation of \ncoastal environments; climate change with associated extreme weather variability and potential \nsea level rise; poor waste management; inadequate sanitation; urban pollution and related \nthreats to freshwater resources; as well as other land and sea-based pollution processes. Partly \nas a result of these pressures, some of the traditional ways of managing the environment are \nnow disappearing. \n \n2.  In addition, Pacific countries have specific vulnerabilities, including poverty, geographic \nisolation, fragile environments, rapid population growth and urbanization, limited land resources, \nhigh dependence on marine resources and increasing use of imported and often inappropriate \ntechnologies.  While  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB  has  been  providing  support  for \naddressing these problems for many years, its environmental assistance program since 1992 \nhas been rather ad hoc, and has lacked a strong strategic direction.  With planning already \nunder way for the next Pacific regional strategy for 2004\u20132008, the time is ripe for a strongly \narticulated  environmental  response  strategy.  Accordingly,  an  ADB  mission  visited  the  Fiji \nIslands and Samoa from 18 to 22 February 2002. The mission met with officials from national \ngovernments and regional agencies to discuss the technical assistance (TA) objective, scope, \nand implementation arrangements.2    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Prior to 1992, ADB assistance to the environment sector in the Pacific region was mainly \nlimited to the preparation of country reports for United Nations Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment 1992 (the Earth Summit), when national environmental management strategies \nwere  prepared  in  most  of  the  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs).  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in the environment area has more recently focused on (i) capacity building for \nenvironmental management, including legislation preparation and institutional strengthening; (ii) \nsupport to the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and to environment-related \nprograms of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission and Secretariat of the Pacific \nCommunity;  and  (iii)  capacity  building  for  strengthening  live  fish  trade  management3  and \ncapacity building to promote traditional environmental management.4  \n \n4.  Furthermore, the ADB lending portfolio for the Pacific has a number of infrastructure \nloans that include various environmental components, especially in the areas of water supply, \nsanitation, solid waste and wastewater management, as well as urban environmental quality \nimprovement.   \n \n                                                 \n1 The Pacific islands region occupies more than 30 million square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean, the total land area \nis 552,789 square kilometers of which, 461,690 square kilometers are occupied by Papua New Guinea. The region \nis unique and characterized by a high degree of ecosystem and species diversity with high vulnerability to a wide \nrange of natural and environmental disasters. The region also has a high degree of economic and cultural \ndependence on the natural environment with an extraordinary diversity of cultures and languages, and traditional \npractices and customs centered around the marine and coastal environment. \n2 The TA (concept paper) is included in the 2002 Pacific Subregional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update.  It \nfirst appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 February 2002. \n3 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Live Fish Trade Management in the Pacific Developing Member \nCountries.

The current Pacific strategy,5 however, has a relatively weak environmental focus.  While \nrecognizing the importance of environmental protection, it does not articulate a sufficiently \ndetailed strategic response. Future interventions and approaches are not explicitly mentioned.  \nThis was also the case with the 1996 strategy.6  The impression is that ADB\u2019s environmental \nassistance to the Pacific has somehow diminished since the 1992 Earth Summit.  \n \n6.  Recent directions in ADB\u2019s approach to development assistance support the need for a \nstrengthened  and  more  focused  environmental  strategy  for  the  Pacific  region.  The \ntransformation of ADB from a project lending institution to a broad-based organization focusing \non  poverty  reduction  is  well  under  way.  Support  for  policy  reform,  good  governance,  and \nestablishment of efficient institutions targeted at poverty reduction have become central foci.  \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy,7 the long term strategic framework,8 and the new medium \nterm strategy9 consistently call for a renewed emphasis on the environment. On one side, \nenvironmental  sustainability  (leading  to  environmentally  sound  economic  development)  is \nrecognized  as  a  central  pillar  for  a  country  (region)  development  strategy;  on  the  other, \nenvironmental sustainability is also identified as one of the three main crosscutting themes \n(footnote 10, Appendix 2 of the MTS). \n \n7.  The new ADB environment policy10 has five policy thrusts, all of which encourage the \ndevelopment of approaches such as the one proposed for this TA. The five core elements are (i) \npromote  environment  and  natural  resource  management  interventions  to  reduce  poverty \ndirectly; (ii) assist DMCs to mainstream environmental considerations in economic growth; (iii) \nhelp  maintain  global  and  regional  life  support  systems  that  underpin  future  development \nprospects;  (iv)  build  partnerships  to  maximize  the  impact  of  ADB  lending  and  nonlending \nactivities;  and  (v)  integrate  environmental  considerations  across  all  ADB  operations.  In \nparticular, the environment policy calls for the preparation of a country environmental analysis \n(CEA) as \u201c\u2026 a process initiated before the country strategy and program [CSP], and continuing \nthrough the CSP preparation in order to, eventually, assess potential environmental issues \nassociated with the CSP.  Assessment is at the policy, program, and sector levels, and not at \nthe project level\u201d.  Guidelines for country environmental analysis are being developed, and \nthese will need to be adapted to specific requirements of the Pacific Department (PARD), the \noutcome possibly being a regional CEA.  \n \n8.  In  accordance  with  the  above  CSP11  formulation  process,  the  Pacific  region \nenvironmental strategy (PRES) will become a pre-CSP thematic (environment) assessment.  As \nsuch it will provide a strong input to the proposed Pacific regional strategy. It will also meet a \nnumber of objectives contained in the ADB environment policy and will constitute the most \nimportant element of the (regional) CEA which, as called for in the environment policy, will \nrequire  further  environmental  strategic  assessment  work  to  be  undertaken  at  the  policy, \nprogram, and sector levels through the regional strategy preparation process in 2003 and 2004.   \n \n9.  Policy  elements  (ii)  and  (v)  of  the  environment  policy  relate  to  the  integration  of \nenvironmental priorities into economic development both at the country planning level and at the \n                                                 \n5 ADB.  2001.

", "    3 \nlevel of ADB operations. This is an important thrust in international thinking about how to \nsimultaneously advance economic and environmental development goals.  A wide range of new \ntechniques and methods is being tried around the world to support policy integration, and to \nallow for the environmental assessment of nonproject proposals (i.e., policies, legislation and \nacts,  sector  planning,  etc.).  Some  of  these  techniques  are  broadly  defined  as  strategic \nenvironmental assessment, policy integration approaches, etc. The proposed PRES will review \nsome of these new approaches to determine their applicability to the PDMCs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The main purpose of the PRES is to produce a strong and well-articulated regional \nenvironmental strategy that will review major environmental challenges in the region and clearly \nformulate the strategic objectives and activities for ADB\u2019s assistance for 2004\u20132008. The focus \nwill be on a clearly defined operational strategy detailing specific modalities for intervention, \nboth through country or regional environmental assessments and lending programs, and the \ninclusion/mainstreaming of environmental priorities in the nonenvironmental projects pipelines. \nThis strategic framework with its various components will constitute an important pre-Pacific \nregional strategy (2004\u20132008)12 thematic assessment, and as such can be considered the most \nsignificant part of the proposed (regional) CEA for the Pacific. \n \n11.  The expected core output is the main PRES document, which  will include the following: \n \n(i)  state of the environment (SOE) section including an SOE summary for the Pacific \nregion with a review of major environmental issues facing the region and a \nsummary set of environmental indicators/data at the regional and when possible \ncountry level;  \n(ii)  evaluation section with a summary assessment review of the implementation \nprogress in the last decade, an analysis of past assistance and lessons learned, \nand a review of priority frameworks for action; \n(iii)  intervention  strategy  section  (a)  identifying  the  strategic  objectives  for  ADB \nenvironment  assistance  during  2004\u20132008,  in  terms  of  both  lending  and \nnonlending  interventions;  (b)  including  a  review  of  operational  modalities  to \nachieve the stated objectives and a review of opportunities for development \npartners\u2019  coordination  with  respect  to  environmental  operations  and \nmainstreaming of environmental priorities across all other interventions; and (c) \nconstituting a major input into the new Pacific regional strategy for 2004\u20132008;  \nand  \n(iv)  country  environmental  analysis  section  for  strategy/program  integration,  (a) \nreviewing individual existing country CSPs13 and CSP updates to identify areas \nfor environmental mainstreaming, and as much as possible, incorporating the \noutcome of the intervention strategy into the CSPs and CSP updates, and (b) \nincluding  an  initial  outline  of  project  pipelines  for  funding  from  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility/Kyoto14  mechanisms  and/or  other  multilateral  funding \nmechanisms and/or ADB channel financing funds. \n                                                 \n12 This proposed document will be published in the Pacific Studies Series. A contents page is attached as Appendix \n4. \n13 CSPs are expected to be formulated for Papua New Guinea and possibly the Fiji Islands. \n14 In December 1997, representatives of 160 countries comprising the Third Conference of Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in Kyoto, Japan, and agreed on the Kyoto Protocol to \nreduce emissions of greenhouse gases \u2014 primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in industrialized ", "4   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Preparation of the PRES main document will involve the following: \n \n(i)  review of the SOE reports and actual available environmental data/indicators \nsets  in  the  PDMCs  (both  at  the  regional  and  country  level)  including  a \nreview/analysis of major environmental issues currently facing the region and the \nPDMCs, and preparation of a summary set of environmental indicators at the \ncountry and regional level as required; \n(ii)  summary  review  of  progress  made  over  the  course  of  the  last  decade  in \nimplementing  Agenda  21  (the  Earth  Summit),  as  well  as  all  the  associated \nregional and national environmental management strategies prepared before and \nafter  the  1992  Earth  Summit;  including  stocktaking  of  the  review  process \nundertaken  for  the  preparation  of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable \nDevelopment,  and reviewing priority frameworks for action presented by the \ncountries to the summit; \n(iii)  summary review of past environmental assistance, development experience, and \nlessons learned; with a particular focus on ADB assistance; \n(iv)  elaboration  of  the  intervention  strategy  (strategic  framework)  including \nidentification of specific objectives, strategic foci (sector, thematic, geographic), \nand  operational  modalities  for  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assistance  and \nenvironmental mainstreaming with special attention to the areas where ADB has \na comparative advantage; \n(v)  identification  of  areas  for  coordination/division  of  labor  with  development \npartners; \n(vi)  undertaking of the CEA for strategy/program integration by reviewing individual \ncountries  CSPs  (Papua  New  Guinea)  and  CSP  updates  to  identify  regions, \nsectors, and thematic areas for policy integration and reorientation of the strategy \nand  assistance  programs  to  better  meet  the  objectives  identified  in  the \nintervention  strategy  (strategic  framework);  and  identification  of  preliminary \nproject pipelines for funding from the Global Environment Facility/Kyoto and other \nsimilar funding mechanisms as well as other ADB channel financing funds;  \n(vii)  review of the application of various tools and approaches for undertaking CEA to \nassess their applicability, including  (i) strategic environmental assessment of \nplans, programs and policies, (ii) other policy integration methods, or (iii) any \nother methodology for CEA used or potentially usable in the PDMCs; and \n(viii)  Selective use on a pilot basis of the above tools and approaches (in particular \npolicy integration and strategic environmental assessment methods) on a limited \nnumber of proposed ADB interventions to carry out the CEA for strategy/program \nintegration.  A list of possible approaches is included in Appendix 5. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000. ADB will provide $300,000 on a grant \nbasis from the ADB-funded TA Program. The Government of New Zealand will provide joint \ncofinancing of $100,000. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements are presented in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \ncountries. Such emissions are believed responsible for climate change. The Kyoto Protocol, provides three \nmechanisms for cooperative implementation of greenhouse gases reduction targets: emissions trading, joint \nimplementation, and the clean development mechanism.  ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be executed by ADB and implemented over about 8 months. It is expected to \ncommence in July 2002 and be completed by March 2003.  \n \n15.  Several  regional  organizations  have  indicated  interest  in  participating  in  the  TA \nimplementation  and  PRES  preparation  process.  These  institutions  as  well  as  the  PDMCs\u2019 \nselected government representatives and nongovernment stakeholders will be consulted during \nthe TA inception stage and invited to a midterm regional workshop in December 2002 and a \nfinal PRES workshop in March 2003.  \n \n16.  The ADB environment sector committee will review the progress of the TA and provide \nappropriate  guidance  as  required.  Consultations  with  regional  organizations,  PDMC \nstakeholders, and ADB staff will be facilitated by the initial consultations, the two regional \nworkshops, the presentation and discussion of the PRES at one or more internal ADB green \nbag seminars and environment sector network meetings, as well as the publication of the PRES \nboth on the ADB website (various drafts and supporting documentation in progress) and as a \nspecial volume of the Pacific Studies Series.  \n \n17.  Considering the current involvement of the ADB Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment in the international debate on CEA approaches/methodologies and its responsibility \nin  the  formulation  of  the  ADB  guidelines  on  CEA,  TA  implementation  will  require  close \ncoordination  and  consultation  between  Pacific  Department  and  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department on the main outputs, activities, and selected methodologies. The \nPRES  will  constitute  an  important  thematic  assessment  supporting  the  proposed  Pacific \nregional strategy 2004\u20132008. All these activities will provide opportunities to provide timely and \nparticipatory feedback on the relevance and adequacy of the proposed PRES.  \n \n18.  A  team  of  four  consultants,  recruited  on  an  individual  basis,  will  assist  TA \nimplementation. The team will consist of two environmental policy specialists-environmental \neconomists (international consultants), primarily based at ADB headquarters for 6\u20138 months. \nTwo environmental specialists (technical research assistants), expected to be recruited locally in \nthe  Philippines,  will  assist  the  international  consultants.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged \nindividually by ADB.  Outline terms of reference for the consultants are presented in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The international consultants will be responsible for all the outputs included in the PRES \nand detailed in the outline terms of reference. They will coordinate preparation of and finalize (i) \nthe inception report (including full description of activities and the detailed work plan) by the end \nof week 3, (ii) the midterm report (draft PRES) by the end of week 24, and (iii) the TA final report \n(main PRES document) by the end of week 32. The midterm and final reports will be prepared \nin accordance with the preliminary outline attached as Appendix 4 subject to any revision \nrequested by and agreed upon with the TA mission leader.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of New Zealand, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis, for the Formulation of the \nPacific Region Environmental Strategy, and hereby reports such action to the Board.

It can have benefits at a minimum of  two levels \n \n(i)   The first is during the development of individual sector strategies (water, energy, \ntransport, etc) that are recognised as legitimate pre-CSP inputs in the CSP \nConceptual Framework contained in Appendix 1 of \u201cBusiness Processes for the \nReorganized  ADB\u201d.  In  addition,  the  ADB  Environment  Policy  calls  for  the \nassessment of sector studies produced as part of ETSW and as part of any \ncountry development strategy and program preparation. \n \n    For example, ADB may wish to examine strategic issues in the water sector in \nKiribati, as a consequence of concerns about supply, and as a precursor to a \nnew TA or loan assistance.  \n \n  As  is  the  case  with  many  small,  atoll-based  countries,  Kiribati  has  difficulty \nsupplying potable water for its population.  There are a number of options open \nto the country, including: desalination; land use planning to protect groundwater \nrecharge  areas;  imports;  tertiary  treatment  of  wastewater;  and  promotion  of \nhousehold rainwater tanks.  All of the options have environmental consequences.  \nA  range  of  decision-aiding  techniques  exists  to  enable  policy  options  to  be \nsystematically compared, and their relative impacts analyzed.   \n \n  A  strategic  assessment  study  would  apply  decision-aiding  techniques  to  the \nproblem  of  water  supply  options  for  Kiribati.    It  would  develop  a  model  for \ndetermining options, developing comparison criteria, weighting of comparison \ncriteria to take account of differing values, and ranking of choices.  It will also \nshow how this approach can involve the public in a focused conflict resolution \nexercise.  Similar decision-aiding approaches can be applied in other countries \nwith similar resource management problems.  \n \nSome of these strategic assessments can be undertaken for other (proposed) TA \nprojects that are in various stages of development.  Examples of where this \nlinkage may occur include: \n \n(cid:1) PPTA for the Fiji Islands for Preparing a Rural Electrification Project; \n \n(cid:1) PPTA for Savaii Hydropower Project (Samoa); \n \n(cid:1) Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Implementation \nof Urban Planning and Management Strategy. \n \n  (ii)   The second point at which strategic environmental assessment thinking has a \nrole to play at the pre - Regional strategy thematic assessment stage is when \ndraft CSPUs for individual countries are being produced.  At this point, strategic \nassessment involves undertaking quick consistency and compatibility analysis, to \nmake  sure  that  sector  interventions  proposed  for  a  country  in  a  CSPU  are ", "16   Appendix 5   \nenvironmentally  consistent  and  compatible.    For  example,  an  energy  sector \nstrategy for the Fiji Islands might indicate a need to extend electricity supply to \nrural areas.  Traditionally, the focus would be on how to electrify in the cheapest \nand most equitable manner.  In many cases this would lead to the conclusion \nthat building new diesel-power capacity is the best solution.  However, a strategic \nenvironmental assessment, of the type mentioned above, would indicate a lack of \ncompatibility  between  the  electrification  goal  and  other  objectives  to  reduce \nreliance on fuel imports and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.15  \n \n \n                                                 \n15 More methodological detail can be found in the reference document: Staff Consulting Contract No. ADM/99-247 \n(Strategic Environmental Assessment Project), produced by ENVD in early 2000.
