THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for  the COVID-19 Active Response and  Expenditure \nSupport (CARES) Program, under the countercyclical support facility (CSF) COVID-19 pandemic \nresponse option (CPRO).1 The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nSupporting COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  has  had  a  devastating  health,  social,  and \neconomic impact on Bangladesh. As of 23 April 2020, there were 4,186 confirmed COVID-19 \ncases in Bangladesh, 127 related deaths, and a cumulative total of 168,350 people quarantined.2 \nBangladesh is now moving to the fourth stage of infection (community transmission), with 59 of \nthe country\u2019s 64 districts affected. The pandemic has led to significant negative impact on the \neconomy with the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate projected to decline to 3.8% in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2020 from 8.2% in FY2019.3  \n \n3.  The economic downturn has seriously affected people\u2019s livelihoods, especially of the poor \nand vulnerable. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that job losses could be as high \nas 3.7 million; many informal workers (85.1% of the workforce) lost their livelihoods instantly after \nthe nationwide lockdown.4 The lack of social safety net coverage will lead to dire consequences \nfor the more than 20% of the population who live below the poverty line and the many newly \njobless who will join them. \n \n4.  The Government of Bangladesh acted quickly to mitigate the health, social, and economic \nimpacts of the pandemic. It implemented aggressive containment measures and announced a \ncountercyclical economic package amounting to $11.2 billion (3.3% of GDP, which includes \nurgent expenditure to expand the social safety net and stimulate the economy to protect jobs. The \ngovernment\u2019s program pursues a pro-poor, gender and socially inclusive approach by expanding \nand strengthening social safety nets addressing the needs faced by women and vulnerable \ngroups.  With  rising  expenditures  and  declining  revenues,  additional  government  financing \nrequirements in FY2020 are estimated at $8.8 billion (14.2% of the FY2020 budget). Facing \nconstraints on domestic borrowing, the government urgently needs external financing to support \nkey pro-poor initiatives and to inject fresh liquidity into the economy to increase aggregate \ndemand.  \n \n5.  The proposed CARES program will provide financial support to the government to help \nmitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bangladesh meets all the access \ncriteria of the CPRO (Table 1). The program implementation support will be provided under the \nattached TA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1   ADB. 2020.

Adverse impact  Given  the  density  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  sizable  slum  population,  and \nof exogenous  underdeveloped  medical  system,  Bangladesh  faces  significant  challenges  in \nshocks   containing the disease. Economic growth is projected to decline from 8.2% in \nFY2019 to 3.8% in FY2020. Up to 13 million people may fall into poverty, as per \nADB estimates. With around 34 million people living below the poverty line, the \npandemic threatens the livelihood of many people. The fiscal deficit may reach \n7.5% of GDP.  \n2. Countercyclical  The government has rolled out an $11.2 billion pro-poor countercyclical package \ndevelopment  with a focus on social protection for the poor and support for key industries to \nexpenditures  preserve jobs. The package will mostly benefit the vulnerable groups of the \npopulation and help industry workers stay employed and out of poverty.  \n3. Pre-shock  Macroeconomic management was largely sound with high growth and benign \nrecord of  inflation before the pandemic. The economy grew 7.4% annually during FY2015\u2013\ngenerally  FY2019. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio was low at 34.9% in FY2019.a Inflation \nsound  averaged 5.8% during FY2015\u2013FY2019, and the budget deficit averaged 4.3% of \nmacroeconomic  GDP during the same period. The foreign exchange reserves were $32.7 billion at \nmanagement  the end of 2019.  \n4. Structural  The National Preparedness and Response Plan was adopted on 18 March 2020 to \nreforms  guide the nation\u2019s health sector response. The COVID-19 Emergency Operation \nCenter was set up at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research \nunder  the  Directorate  General  of  Health  Services  to  coordinate  nationwide \npreparedness and response activities. Entry control and screening was enforced, \nand  testing  efforts  were  strengthened.  The  government  also  imposed  social \ndistancing measures, including the closure of public and private establishments and \nsuspension  of  public  transportation  services.  The  countercyclical  economic \npackage is being implemented by various agencies to stabilize the financial market, \nprovide a cash cushion for the poor, and protect employment by supporting key \nindustries and SMEs. \n5. Debt  Public debt in Bangladesh was $105 billion in FY2019, around 34.9% of GDP, and \nsustainability  the external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt ratio was 14.5% of GDP, \nboth are low. The additional external debt of $2.9 billion, as government projected, \nwill increase both the external PPG debt\u2013GDP ratio and public debt\u2013GDP ratio by \n0.9% in FY2020. Bangladesh remains at a low risk of debt distress. \n6. Coordination  ADB  coordinates  closely  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and \nwith the IMF   participation in Article IV missions. The IMF supports ADB\u2019s response measures \nand  has  provided  its  assessment  letter.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n1.  The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact \n6.  The rapid spread of the pandemic in Bangladesh. Since the identification of the initial \ncases in Wuhan in Hubei province in the People\u2019s Republic of China, the outbreak of COVID-19 \nhas been spreading rapidly across the world with a significant public health and economic impact. \nIn Bangladesh, the first case was reported on 8 March 2020 and since then, though initially slow, \nthe increase in the number of cases has been significant. As of 23 April 2020, there were 4,186 \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh and 127 related deaths with a cumulative total of \n168,350 people quarantined (footnote 2). The number of confirmed cases doubles every five days. \nA high population density,5 rapid urbanization, a large population of migrant workers, and a high \nshare of the country\u2019s urban population living in slums make Bangladesh vulnerable to infectious \ndisease outbreaks.  \n \n7.  Bangladesh faces significant health care challenges in combatting the pandemic. \nThe health system in Bangladesh is underdeveloped and underfunded, with only 9.9 doctors, \nnurses and midwives6 and 8.8 hospital beds per 10,000 people, while current health expenditure \nis only 2.4% of GDP. Bangladesh\u2019s COVID-19 testing capacity is at 219 tests processed per 1 \nmillion people.7 As of 21 April 2020, over 200 doctors and 150 healthcare workers including \nnurses have been infected.8 There are shortages of essential testing equipment and standard \nlaboratories, personal protective equipment for medical staff, sanitized ambulances to transfer \ninfected people, ventilators to support critical patients, and specialized wards and hospitals. Social \ndistancing measures are also made less effective because of crowded living conditions in urban \nareas.  \n \n8.  The pandemic has serious economic impacts. The pandemic has a significant impact \non the economic outlook. The IMF projects that economic growth will weaken to 3.8% in FY2020, \nbreaking a long streak of rapid growth9 (Figure 1). This would be the slowest growth rate since \n2002, lower than the 5% growth at the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. The nationwide \nlockdown has resulted in simultaneous supply and demand shocks, with production, consumption, \ntrade, and investment all at a standstill. By sector, industry is expected to decline by 2.0% (from \n12.7% in FY2019) and services by 3.5% (from 6.8% in FY2019) (Figure 2). The traditional growth \ndrivers of the economy\u2014export-oriented industries, remittances, domestic consumptions, and \nSMEs\u2014have all ground to a halt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5  Dhaka has the highest population density in the world, estimated at 44,500 people per square kilometer.

Exports have declined sharply, and further reductions are expected. Exports have \nbeen one of the main drivers of economic and social development in Bangladesh.  The growth \nrate was 10.9% in 2019 but a decline of 19.8% is expected in FY2020.10 The labor-intensive \nready-made  garment  (RMG)  industry  exported  goods  valued  at  $34.1  billion  in  FY2019, \naccounting for 84.0% of the total merchandise exports and 11.3% of GDP.11 The industry employs \nabout 4.1 million people, most of them women. However, lockdowns and social distancing \nmeasures across countries have disrupted global supply chains and dampened demand from \noverseas markets. The export volume in March 2020 dropped by 18.3% compared to March \n2019.12 With  Europe  and  the  United  States  (accounting  for  73%  of  the  country\u2019s  market, \ncombined) in recession, about $3.2 billion of export orders had already been canceled or \nsuspended as of 16 April 2020, affecting 2.3 million workers.13 \n \n10.  Remittance inflows affected by the pandemic and oil shock. Remittances, amounting \nto $16.4 billion in FY2019 or 5.4% of GDP, have been a steady source of household incomes and \nhelp the country manage its balance of payments.14 After years of steady growth and registering \na 20.0% growth rate in the first 8 months of FY2020, remittances decreased by 11.3% in March \ncompared to last year. Most of Bangladesh\u2019s migrant workers are based in the Gulf countries that \nare affected both by the pandemic and abrupt decline in oil prices.15 Total remittances are \nexpected to stagnate in FY2020 and drop sharply in FY2021. The reduction in remittance inflow \nwill impact consumption and put the livelihood of many migrant workers\u2019 families at risk. \n \n11.  Contraction of domestic consumption. Domestic consumption accounts for 75% of the \neconomy.16 The nationwide lockdown and social distancing measures have resulted in significant \n \n10  Center for Global Workers\u2019 Rights. 2020.

COVID-19 Community Mobility Report. Bangladesh. \n \n12.  Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  experience  severe  challenges. \nBangladesh has around 8 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). MSMEs \ncontribute around 20%\u201325% of the GDP, and account for the majority of the total employment \noutside of agriculture and the public sector.17 Though growing steadily, MSMEs are still thinly \nresourced, with the majority being cottage and micro enterprises with fixed assets of Tk5 million \nor less. With limited collateral, they generally lack access to bank credits; the financing gap has \nbeen estimated at $2.8 billion (footnote 17). Since most MSMEs are concentrated in retail trading, \ntransport, and light manufacturing, they have been badly affected by the lockdown and supply \nchain disruptions. The sharp decline of the RMG industry also negatively affects other SMEs in \nthe same ecosystem. \n \n13.  The pandemic has a serious impact on poverty. The pandemic threatens to worsen \nthe poverty situation in Bangladesh. In 2019, over 34 million people or 20.5% of Bangladesh\u2019s \npopulation were poor and 17 million or 10.5% were extremely poor.18 The effects of the lockdowns \nand consequent economic disruptions have led to a spike in poverty. The International Food \nPolicy Research Institute estimates that an additional 42 million people in South Asia could fall \ninto extreme poverty in 2020 due to the pandemic.  For Bangladesh, ADB estimates that the \npandemic is expected to drive an additional 7.7% of the population or close to 13 million people \ninto poverty. The lockdown deprives the poor and the vulnerable people of their livelihood \nsources. In addition, it is also difficult for them to receive timely and adequate government support \nas they are likely to be unbanked, have no tax records, and have no social insurance. \n \n14.  Four  groups  of  workers  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  economic  fallouts  of  the \npandemic.  \n(i)  The informal sector workers. About 85.1% (around 59.2 million workers) of the \nlabor force is engaged in the informal sector, living hand-to-mouth on their daily \nincomes; 68.9% of them are women. With no sick leaves, no insurance and little \nsavings, these daily laborers, rickshaw pullers, restaurant workers and micro \nbusinesses  face  daunting  challenges  to  maintain  their  livelihood  during  the \nlockdowns and economic disruptions.  \n \n17  World Bank. 2019.

More than 1 million of 4 million garment workers in Bangladesh \nhave lost their jobs due to a fall in global demand (footnote 11). About 53.2% of \nthese are female and 80.4% of them went home without their severance pay. Low-\nskilled  female  workers  living  in  rural  areas  without  pay  remain  exposed  to \ndifficulties of making daily livelihood. \n(iii)  Returnee migrant workers. More than 10 million Bangladesh nationals work \noverseas, mostly in Europe, Gulf countries, and Southeast Asian countries. Almost \na million of these have returned due to the pandemic crisis in their host countries. \nThese workers would likely remain unemployed and cannot return overseas soon.  \n(iv)  Farm workers. About 25 million (40.6%) people are employed in the agriculture \nsector. They have low monthly income compared to other sectors (footnote 4). \nLockdowns are going to disrupt transportation and with lack of storage facilities, \nthe farmers may have to bear significant losses, especially on perishable foods. \nThis can impede farmers\u2019 access to markets, curb their income, and worsen \npoverty. \n \n15.  The pandemic has a significant impact on country\u2019s fiscal position. Before the \npandemic, the country\u2019s economy was on track to grow by 7.8% in FY2020.19 The budget deficit \nwas expected to return to the 5% range after a temporary jump to 5.5% in FY2019, due to \nelections. The tax revenue collection was expected to increase due to sustained economic growth \nand a newly implemented VAT scheme. Nearly 90% of the government revenue comes from tax \ncollection, of which 65% are from indirect taxes including VAT and other duties. However, the \npandemic and consequent stoppage of economic activities is expected to significantly reduce tax \nreceipts. Nontax revenue will also be severely affected by the reduction of imports and other fee \nsources. A minimum revenue loss of 2% of GDP ($6.7 billion) is projected by the government. \nExpenditure is expected to increase sharply due to increased spending in health care, social \nprotection and economic stimulus packages. Per ADB\u2019s estimate, the fiscal deficit is likely to rise \nto 7.5% of GDP in FY2020. For FY2020 and FY2021, the IMF projected fiscal deficits of 6.9% \nand 6.5% of GDP respectively (footnote 9) while World Bank projected 7.7% and 9.8%.20 \n \n16.  The government\u2019s COVID-19 response. The government has mounted immediate and \nrobust responses in the areas of public health, social protection and economic stimulation. On 18 \nMarch 2020, the government adopted the National Preparedness and Response Plan to contain \nthe threat of the pandemic to public health. The Plan has seven components: (i) planning and \ncoordination; (ii) strengthening surveillance, laboratory, and screening at the points of entry; (iii) \ncontact tracing and quarantine; (iv) clinical case management; (v) infection prevention and control; \n(vi) risk communication and public awareness; and (vii) operational research.21 To protect the \npoor and to support the economy, the government has adopted a countercyclical expenditure plan \nwith the following major strategic programs: (i) expanding social safety net programs to meet the \nbasic needs of people living below the poverty line, day laborers, and those engaged in the \ninformal sector, with emphasis on vulnerable women and groups; (ii) introducing a fiscal stimulus \npackage to retain manufacturing workers; and (iii) increasing government spending with a target \nto create jobs and increase aggregate demand. The government plan comprises economic \npackages totaling $11.2 billion (3.3% of GDP).    \n \n17.  The government\u2019s health response. Social distancing measures were introduced, and \nall large gatherings were canceled. A nationwide lockdown was enforced starting 26 March 2020 \n \n19 ADB. 2020.

Government agencies, led by the Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare, with the support of development partners including ADB, are stepping \nup efforts to strengthen testing, isolation, tracking, and treatment efforts. Testing capacity was \nextended from one laboratory to 20, and a total of 36,090 tests have been conducted as of 24 \nApril 2020 (or 219 tests per 1 million people). \n \n18.  Efforts to expand testing and provide treatment to COVID-19 patients are constrained by \nlimitations of the health care system. An amount of Tk2.5 billion has been initially provided to the \nHealth Services Division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to fund the COVID-19 \npreparedness and response plan. The government has made investments to strengthen its health \nsector response with support from development partners, including emergency loans from ADB22 \nand the World Bank23 totaling $200 million. \n \n2.  The Government Countercyclical Expenditure Plan \n19.  Expanding social safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable. According to the \nexpenditure plan, support will be provided to fulfil the basic needs of people living below or near \nthe poverty line and people engaged in informal work. People risking their own safety fighting the \npandemic, such as doctors, nurses, and health care workers, will also be aided. Women are \nspecially targeted among most of the groups being supported. Some of the programs are (details \nare listed in Table 2): \n(i)  Special honorarium to government doctors, nurses, and medical workers (majority \nare females) engaged in treating COVID-19 patients. As of 21 April, over 350 \ndoctors, nurses and health workers have been infected by COVID-19.  \n(ii)  Special health insurance of Tk0.5 to Tk1 million and life insurance 5 times of health \ninsurance  coverage  to  physicians,  nurses,  other  health  workers,  field-level \nadministration officers, members of law enforcement agencies, and others directly \ninvolved in the fight against the pandemic.  \n(iii)  The social protection such as the old age allowance and the allowance scheme for \nwidowed and husband-deserted distressed women expanded to cover all eligible \npeople in 100 most poverty-stricken upazilas (subdistrict). About 1 million new \nbeneficiaries will be enrolled. \n(iv)  Cash transfer to low-income people engaged in the informal sector, including day \nlaborers, hawkers, rickshaw and van pullers, transport workers, and hotel workers \nwho have lost their income because of the lockdown. Through this program, two \nmillion low-income earners (mostly women) will receive cash during the period of \nlockdown and Ramadan. \n(v)  Food distribution free of charge to low-income people (rice 500,000 tons, wheat \n100,000 tons) to ensure food safety for the poorest people.  \n \n20.  Protect jobs in export industries, industrial and services sectors and SMEs. Job \nlosses are mounting, and businesses are struggling. The government has made funds available \nthrough subsidized zero-cost credit to support factory worker salary payments. The primary \nbeneficiaries are the RMG sector workers on the verge of being furloughed or dismissed. Low-\ncost loans will be provided to the factories to preserve employment, support SMEs, and maintain \nthe competitive edge of Bangladesh\u2019s export industries. Some of the programs are (details are \nlisted in Table 2): \n \n22  ADB. 2020. People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh: COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project.

The fund will be available to export-oriented industries which export a \nminimum of 80% of its total production (almost all RMG factories). It will be used for \npayment of salaries and allowances of workers and employees for April, May and June \nbased on historical average of salaries and allowances. The primary beneficiaries of the \nprogram are RMG factory workers (most are low-skilled women workers). It is estimated \nthat 1.5 million workers could benefit from this program.  \n(ii)  Subsidized loans through commercial banks to affected SMEs. The government will \nprovide an annual interest rate subsidy of 5%, effectively reducing rates from 9% to 4%. \nSMEs in the retail, service and transportation sectors were all seriously impacted. Lacking \nresources and with poor access to finance, these SMEs will receive some relief from this \nprogram  to stay in business and keep their workers. \n \nTable 2: Countercyclical Expenditure Package  \n(as of 26 April 2020) \nAmount  Amount  Key \nItem  (Tk billion)  ($ million)  Beneficiaries  \nSocial Protection \nSpecial honorarium to government doctors, nurses, and  1.0  12  Health workers \nmedical workers engaged in treating COVID-19 patients   (majority female) \nSpecial health and life insurance will be provided to  7.5  88  Health workers \nphysicians, nurses, other health workers, field-level  and engaged \nadministration officers, members of law enforcement  officials \nagencies, Armed Forces, and others directly involved in   \nthe fight against the pandemic at the risk of their personal \nsafety  \nExpanding the social protection such as the old age  8.2  96  Elderly people, \nallowance and the allowance scheme for widowed and  widowed and \nhusband-deserted distressed women to cover all eligible  husband-\npeople of the 100 most poverty-stricken upazilas  deserted \n(subdistrict)  distressed \nwomen  \nCash transfers directly to low-income people in the  7.6  89  Low-income \ninformal sector  groups  \nFood distribution free of charge to low-income people  25.0  293  Low-income \n(rice 500,000 tons, wheat 100,000 tons) to ensure food  groups \nsafety  \nOpen market sale of rice at Tk10 per kilogram to low- 2.5  29  Low-income \nincome people (74,000 tons for 3 months)   groups \nExpedited house construction for homeless people  21.3  250  Homeless people \n \nSupport industries to protect jobs \nInterest-free loans through commercial banks to export- 50.0  586  Factory workers \noriented businesses to pay workers\u2019 salaries.

Coordinated  monetary  policy  responses  to  ease  financial  market  stress.  The \nBangladesh Bank, the central bank,  took steps to keep credit from freezing. Before the crisis, the \ntotal capital adequacy ratio for the banking industry was 10.5%, but the capital buffer is likely to \nhave  been  eroded  during  the  lockdown  period  (footnote  20).  Regulatory  forbearance  was \nexercised to support the banking industry which is likely to experience growing nonperforming \nloan  (NPL)  issues  after  the  pandemic.  Bangladesh  Bank  issued  circulars  to  delay  NPL \nclassification and extend the tenures of trade instruments, the submission of import bill entries to \nthe bank, the issuance period of back-to-back letters of credit, and the repayment tenure of loans \nfrom the Export Development Fund. To boost liquidity in the system, the Bangladesh Bank \nannounced that it will buy treasury bonds and bills from banks. Effective from 15 April 2020, the \ncentral bank fixed the cash reserve ratio at 3.5% on a daily-basis requirement and 4.0% on a bi-\nweekly average basis. \n \n3.  Macroeconomic Management and Debt Sustainability \n22.  Sound macroeconomic management before the pandemic. The economy had been \ngrowing at 7.4% and inflation kept at 5.8% during FY2015\u2013FY2019. The public debt to GDP ratio \nis at 34.9% and external public debt to GDP ratio is at 14.5% in FY2019,24 both are low. Despite \na low revenue\u2013GDP ratio (9.9% in FY2019), the average fiscal deficit was 4.3% of GDP during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019, still within the budget target of 5.0%. However, the fiscal deficit rose to 5.5% of \nGDP in FY2019 because of increased spending during national elections and was expected to \ndecline to 5.0% before the onset of the pandemic. Concentrated public investment in physical and \nsocial infrastructure (59% of the FY2020 budget) was a key contributing factor to the rapid GDP \ngrowth. The foreign exchange reserves, which were $32.7 billion at the end of 2019, cover 5.9 \nmonths of imports (footnote 19). \n \n23.  IMF Article IV consultation concluded in September 2019 confirmed that \u201cBangladesh \ncontinues to achieve impressive economic growth and social development.\u201d The Joint World \nBank\u2013IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis in September 2019 confirmed that Bangladesh remained \nat a low risk of debt distress, with all external and domestic debt indicators below their respective \nthresholds under the baseline and stress test scenarios.25 \n \n \n24 IMF Assessment Letter and Press Release of IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV consultation with \nBangladesh (Available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  World Bank\u2013IMF. 2019. Joint World Bank\u2013IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis. Washington, DC. \n ", "10 \n24.  Public debt remains sustainable. Public debt in Bangladesh was $105 billion in FY2019 \n(around 34.9% of GDP) and external PPG debt was $44 billion (around 14.5% of GDP) (footnote \n24). Without COVID-19, in FY2020, the public debt is projected to increase to 35.5% of GDP and \nthe external PPG debt to 14.6% of GDP. The debt sustainability analysis confirmed the debt \nsustainability of Bangladesh even under the impacts of the pandemic and after factoring in the \nadditional borrowings. With the additional $2.9 billion of external borrowings and $5.9 billion of \ndomestic financing, the external PPG debt\u2013GDP ratio will increase to 16.0%, and the public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio will increase to 39.6% in FY2020. Both the external debt ratio and public debt ratio will \nremain stable over the medium term, with all external debt and public debt indicators well below \nthe threshold levels for debt burden indicators, even under various stress scenarios.26 \n \n25.  Financial sector. One of the pre-existing vulnerabilities in Bangladesh\u2019s economy is the \nweakness in the financial sector. At the onset of the pandemic, the NPL ratio stood at 9.3% as of \nthe end of 2019. Most of the NPLs are in the state-owned commercial banks, with an NPL ratio \nof 23.9% at the end of 2019. Even before the crisis, private sector businesses, especially SMEs, \nhad  serious  challenges  accessing  bank  credit.  Because  of  the  lack  of  funds  available  for \nborrowing, bank credit to the private sector grew only 9.9% in 2019, which is the slowest growth \nrate  since  2008.  Most  banks  have  undiversified  portfolios  with  concentrated  exposures  to \ncorporate loans. The pandemic threatens to further increase the stress in the banking system. \n \n26.  Capital markets. Both the stock and bond markets are underdeveloped, presenting a \nchallenging domestic funding environment for both the private sector and the government. Total \nstock  market  capitalization  was  only  16.4%  of  GDP  in  2018.27 The  development  of  the \ngovernment securities market is hampered by the rapid increase of national saving certificate \n(NSC) sales, which has now been capped. NSCs are a government-issued saving instrument \ncarrying risk-free returns of up to more than 11%,28 which makes them very popular for investors \nbut very costly in terms of the public finance. Overall, the government securities are thinly traded, \nand the main investors are commercial banks, which were facing liquidity issues even before the \npandemic. In conclusion, the domestic funding sources are limited and costly. \n \n27.  Regional cooperation. The government has pledged $1.5 million to the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Corona Emergency Fund. The fund has been \nused to deliver medical supplies and machines to SAARC member countries. Potential areas for \nregional  collaboration  include  closer  collaboration  between  the  national  health  emergency \nagencies and creation of a central repository to disseminate information. Information sharing, \nsupply deliveries and policy dialogues have already started under the support of the fund. \n  \nB.  Policy Reforms and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n28.  The program will support the Government to mitigate the severe social and economic \nimpact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Specifically,  the  program  will  support  government  to \nimplement its pro-poor, gender and socially inclusive COVID-19 response plan which expands \nand strengthens social safety nets to address the needs of poor and vulnerable groups. The \nGovernment program will also protect employment in the key industries, such as the labor-\nintensive RMG sector where the majority of the workers are vulnerable low-skilled female workers. \nThe proposed program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, including operational priorities on \n \n26 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The Dhaka Stock Exchange hit a 7-year low in March before trading was suspended from 26 March 2020. Economic \nconcerns dragged down the share value of textile companies and banks. \n28  In comparison, the yield of 5-year treasury bonds is only 8.05% in March 2020, based on CEIC data.  \n ", "11 \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity.29 \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  continuous  policy  dialogues  with  the  government \ncontributed to the development of the government\u2019s response strategy and development financing \nplan. ADB has supported and worked closely with the government in preparing the national health \nresponse plan and in formulating the economic stimulus packages. Discussions have been held \nat various levels including with technical staff and the highest level of government, including the \nPrime Minister\u2019s office, the finance secretary, and the health secretary. In close coordination with \nother  development  partners,  ADB  brought  to  the  table  its  regional  experience  in  disaster \npreparedness, health management, and implementation of pro-poor, gender-responsive policy \nactions.  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  encompasses  several  important  areas.  First,  through  a \nregional TA (Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and \nPotential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases), ADB provided a $350,000 emergency \ngrant in March 2020 to support the procurement of health safety materials to effectively support \nand protect those on the front line and medical staff.30 Second,  ADB has approved the COVID-\n19  Emergency  Assistance  Response  Project  of  $100  million  on  30  April  2020  to  aid  the \nprocurement of equipment and supplies; the upgrading of health and testing facilities; and the \nbuilding of system and community capacities for surveillance, prevention, and response to the \npandemic. Third, through the proposed CARES program, ADB will fund government expenditures \nin critical areas such as the expansion of social safety nets for vulnerable women and other groups \nand support critical labor-intensive industries, and SMEs, in order to preserve jobs. During \nprogram implementation, ADB will support the effective targeting of the poor especially vulnerable \nwomen to maximize the pro-poor and gender impact of its COVID-19 response. \n \n31.  ADB, through its private sector window, is also working to provide the private sector with \nliquidity support and trade finance.  The pipeline includes transactions in the infrastructure, \nfinancial institutions, agribusiness and social sectors, for existing clients and new. All these \ncoordinated efforts aim to provide short-term social protection as well as have a medium- to long-\nterm impact through sustaining aggregate demand and protecting the industrial base, which are \nconsidered vital to Bangladesh\u2019s economic recovery and continued growth momentum. \n \n32.  ADB has been a partner with the government in many areas of structural reforms, including \ncapital market development and support for good governance.31 Prior to the pandemic, ADB had \nbeen  in  close  engagement  with  the  government  in  the  areas  of  banking  industry  reform, \nstrengthening income tax collection, and disaster risk finance. As part of ADB\u2019s plan for medium-\nterm interventions, these efforts will continue and may take on increased urgency as the pandemic \nhas revealed the strong need for continued structural reforms in these areas. To speed up the \nrecovery and stimulate aggregate demand, government spending needs to be increased. ADB\u2019s \nongoing and planned support for infrastructure development will be strengthened to facilitate \nthese efforts. Private sector will play an important role in the recovery.

ADB\u2019s support to Bangladesh\u2019s economic response to the pandemic. The program \nwill provide the government with budget support to mitigate the severe social and economic \nimpact of COVID-19. The government programs will expand and strengthen social safety nets for \nthe most vulnerable groups of the population during the pandemic. Cash and in-kind payments \nwill be delivered to these populations through existing agencies for expedited implementation. \nAside from funding support, ADB will provide capacity development and support through the \nattached TA. The government programs will assist the worst-hit industries such as the RMG and \nservice industries. Many low-wage earners who work in these labor-intensive industries are ill-\nequipped to withstand any work suspensions, let alone job losses. These programs will keep the \nworkers  employed  and  preserve  critical  industry  sectors  and  their  corresponding  business \ninfrastructure, which will be important for the economy to return to its pre-pandemic growth \ntrajectory. \n \n34.  The program will be aligned with the following overarching development objectives of the \ncountry: inequality and unemployment reduced and adverse social and economic impact of \nCOVID-19 pandemic mitigated. The reforms undertaken under the program will have the following \neffect: adverse socioeconomic impact to vulnerable groups reduced. The program loans will \nsupport  the  following  reform  areas:  social  safety  net  to  vulnerable  groups  expanded,  and \nemployment opportunities protected. Under the attached TA, program implementation will be \nsupported, and further reform areas will be identified. \n \n35.  Coordination with the International Monetary Fund and other development partners. \nADB maintains close coordination with the IMF, and the IMF has also provided ADB with an \nassessment letter which confirmed the debt sustainability of Bangladesh with increased external \nfinancing. The country preparedness and response plan (CPRP) was developed jointly by the \ngovernment  and  development  partners  including  ADB  to  coordinate  support  efforts  by  the \ninternational communities. The government allocates specific elements of its response plan to \neach development partner, in line with the country\u2019s needs and volume of assistance provided. \nThe IMF is requested by the government to provide SDR500 million for a rapid credit facility to \naddress balance of payments issues. Through close coordination, complementarity between two \nprojects in the health sector, one for World Bank and one for ADB, was ensured. The World \nBank\u2019s $100 million loan project will support information- and technology-based approaches to \ndisease surveillance and provide training and equipment for facilities and geographic areas as \nidentified by the government. ADB\u2019s $100 million emergency assistance health package will \nsupport the procurement of equipment and supplies, the upgrading of health and testing facilities, \nand the building of systems and community capacities. For countercyclical economic support, \nADB will provide $500 million through this proposed program while the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB) will provide a $250 million loan with ADB as the cofinancing partner.  \n \n36.  To support the Rohingya people, the government has a separate program to avoid the \nbreakout of COVID-19 in the camps and mitigate any impact thereof. This includes establishing \nisolation units and providing health facilities. Currently, the World Bank has two ongoing grant \nprojects ($185 million) for the health sector which are being used to manage and mitigate the \n \n32 ADB. 2015.

ADB is exploring additional grant funds to complement the \nWorld Bank support. \n \nD.   Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n37.  The  government  has  requested  loans  of  $250  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources and $250 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources through the \nCPRO under the CSF. The government has also requested a loan of $250 million from the AIIB \nunder its COVID-19 response package. The pandemic is expected to result in a decline in \nrevenues, estimated at 2% of GDP, as well as an increase in countercyclical expenditures. The \nprogram will finance the anticipated fiscal deficits. The government\u2019s initial estimates indicate \nadditional financing needs of $8.8 billion (14.2% of the annual budget of $61.6 billion). About $2.9 \nbillion of the deficits will be financed through external sources and $5.9 billion from the domestic \nmarket. The capital market in the country is underdeveloped. Historically, the principal domestic \nfinanciers of the government have been the commercial banks. The external borrowing amount \nhas been fixed after considering sufficient liquidity in the domestic market and to avoid crowding \nout the private sector during the last quarter of the fiscal year (Table 3).  \n \nTable 3: Government Additional Financing Requirement because of COVID-19 \n($ million) \n2020 \n  2020  COVID-19  Additional \nItem  Pre-COVID-19  Adjusteda  Financing Needs \nTotal financing requirement  17,025  25,835  8,810 \nGross domestic financing  10,914  16,835  5,921 \nGross foreign financing  6,111  9,000  2,889 \n   \nSource of fundsb   \nAsian Development Bankc      600 \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bankd      250 \nWorld Bank      100 \nInternational Monetary Funde      700 \nOther sourcesf      1,239 \nTotal commitments       2,889 \na  Preliminary estimates.  \nb  Includes approved and proposed. \nc  Includes this proposed program and $100 million COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project. \nd  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank financing will be cofinanced with the Asian Development Bank. \ne  International Monetary Fund facility provides balance of payments support of SDR500 million. \nf  The government has reached out to other multilateral or bi-lateral partners for additional funds. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n38.

ADB financing comprises (i) a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 50 basis points, for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and (ii) a loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during \nthe grace period and thereafter, for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.33 AIIB \nis expected to provide $250 million support in parallel co-financing.  The total loan size is based \non Bangladesh\u2019s financing needs and development spending arising from the development \nexpenditure programs. \n \n33The $250 million concessional ordinary capital lending will be from the existing country allocation following \nreprogramming, and savings freed up from ongoing projects. \n ", "14 \nE.

The \ngovernment,  through  the  MOF,  will  monitor  budget  execution  and  flow  of  funds  for  the \ncountercyclical measures. The government through the MOF will submit to ADB monthly reports \nin the first three months and quarterly reports thereafter on activities, expenditures from the state \nbudget to support the countercyclical measures, and on the beneficiaries. The program will be \nunder the oversight of the Cabinet Committee on Social Security Program,34 and ADB\u2019s TA \nresources will be provided to the Committee to enhance monitoring and to support policy \ndevelopment, medium-term planning, and regional cooperation. The program implementation \nperiod is from May 2020 to December 2021. The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s arrangements \nwith the Finance Division of the MOF. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n40.  A TA will be attached to the program to help the government improve its institutional \ncapacity  and  program  implementation.  The  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the \nDepartment of Social Services under the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Department of Women \nAffairs under the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, and the Department of Disaster \nManagement under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief will be the implementing \nagencies. The TA will (i) support the program implementation by providing capacity support and \ndevelopment; (ii) provide direct support for the delivery of services through the existing social \nsafety net; (iii) introduce new tools and solutions to improve poverty and gender targeting and \nservice delivery, including digital financial services and banking channels; (iv) develop a gender-\nresponsive plan to improve the social safety net in the country; and (v) improve the monitoring \nand evaluation capacity and data collection. \n \n41.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which will be financed on a grant basis from the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff; office, administrative, and logistics support; and other in-kind \ncontributions.  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All consultants shall be recruited \nin accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nassociated project administration instructions and/or technical assistance staff instructions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n42.  Governance.  The  institutional  framework  of  public  financial  management  (PFM)  in \nBangladesh  is  under  transition  and  several  improvements  have  been  made  or  are  being \nattempted. To date, three public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessments \nhave been undertaken on Bangladesh\u2014in 2006, 2010, and 2016. The 2016 PEFA assessment \nnotes that, overall, there has been a renewed focus on PFM activities and a continued emphasis \non improving PFM processes and procedures. In addition, Bangladesh has made positive strides \nin developing its PFM systems since the 2010 PEFA assessment. However, improvements are \nneeded in areas such as internal and external audit and annual financial reports.  \n \n43.  The dominant role of the MOF in budget management has contributed to the country\u2019s \nstrong record of fiscal discipline. Bangladesh performed well with respect to comprehensiveness \n \n34 A cabinet committee headed by the Finance Minister to provide oversight on country\u2019s social protection programs.  \n ", "15 \nof budget documentation and public access to key fiscal information. The integrity of financial data \nis sound since access and changes to integrated budgeting and accounting system records are \nrestricted and recorded. Strengthening Bangladesh\u2019s PFM through TA and policy-based loans is \npart of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. Currently, ADB is providing capacity building support \nto the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh through TA35 for the development \nof an audit manual for foreign-aided projects and for the provision of training to audit staff. \n \n44.  To ensure a robust mechanism for timely and transparent identification of beneficiaries of \nthe government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program as well as  an effective performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system,  programs  funds  will  go  through  the  existing  budgetary \nchannels under overall monitoring by the MOF. Most of these channels (Bangladesh Bank, \nDepartment of Social Services, Ministry of Social Welfare) have been supported by various \ndevelopment partners including ADB, which makes it conducive for effective monitoring and \nevaluation. A government accounting software package (IBAS++) will be used to record the \ntransactions and the attached TA will support project implementation and aid in devising a plan \nfor developing a long-term social safety net. \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MOF. \n \n46.  Poverty and social. The substantial progress made by Bangladesh in poverty reduction \nand social development in recent years is at risk from the pandemic. Despite the progress made, \nBangladesh still has 34 million people living in poverty. Moreover, almost half of Bangladesh\u2019s \npopulation lives marginally above the poverty line and risks falling back into poverty because of \nthe pandemic. \n \n47.  The pandemic has resulted in severe disruptions to domestic economic activities, which \nare expected to increase unemployment and incidences of poverty. It is estimated that 1.4 million\u2013\n3.7 million workers may lose their jobs and 13 million people may fall back into poverty, many of \nthem informal sector workers. The government\u2019s countercyclical social protection expenditures \ninclude a number of programs designed to provide direct and immediate relief for the poor. The \npoor and vulnerable groups will receive cash payments and food supply and this support is \nextended to the informal workers, who are not currently covered by the social safety net. Overall, \nmore than 15 million people can benefit from the government programs already announced. \nFurthermore, the government programs also aim to protect jobs in the labor-intensive export \nindustries and SMEs, with salary support or low interest rate loans for businesses.  These \nprograms will help the workers to maintain their living standard while keeping the industries in \nbusiness. By preserving the industrial base of the country, these government programs will help \nlay the ground for a faster economic recovery and sustained poverty reductions going forward.  \n \n48.  Gender. Bangladesh has been ranked the top South Asian country for gender and 50th \non the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index.36 Despite the improvements made, \ngender inequality persists in Bangladesh. Women still own only 13% of agricultural land37 and \nhave lower levels of literacy (56.87%, as against 61.28% for men).38 They have a lower labor \nmarket participation rate, particularly in the formal economy (36.3% for women and 80.5% for \nmen). Households headed by women accounted for 12.5% of all households in 2014 and are \n \n35  ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Improving Portfolio Performance.

Adverse impact of  The  pandemic  has  severe  negative  health  and  economic  impacts  on \nexogenous shocks   Bangladesh.  \n \nHealth impact. Given the density of the country\u2019s population, sizable slum \npopulation,  and  its  underdeveloped  medical  system,  Bangladesh  faces \nsignificant challenges in containing the disease and providing treatment to \ninfected people.  \n \nImpact on the economy. The economy was hit by the pandemic and the \nsubsequent lockdown. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth in fiscal year \nFY2020 will drop to 3.8% by IMF estimate. The economy will be also be \naffected by the spillover effects of the global recession, as already evidenced \nin the decline of export and remittances. \n \nImpact on the vulnerable population. With 20.5% of the population still living \nbelow the poverty line, 10.5% of the population living in extreme poverty, and \nalmost half of the population marginally above the poverty line, the population \nis extremely vulnerable to external shocks. The livelihood of many workers in \nthe informal sector is at risk because of the nationwide lockdown and the \nensuing economic recession. By potentially putting 13 million people below the \nnational poverty line, the pandemic threatens to reverse decades of progress \nmade in poverty reduction in Bangladesh. \n \nImpact on the fiscal position of the country. Revenue will be reduced \nbecause of slow economy and trade, and expenditures will escalate to fund \nthe economic stimulus. Overall, the budget deficit is expected to rise to 7.5% \nfrom 5.0% projected before the pandemic.  \n \n2. Countercyclical  The government has rolled out countercyclical measures to combat the \ndevelopment  pandemic. The government\u2019s priority is to provide funding to strengthen the \nexpenditures  health care services and infrastructure. An additional Tk2.5 billion has been \nprovided to the Health Services Division of the Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare  to  fund  a  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  preparedness  and \nresponse plan. On 5 April 2020, a countercyclical expenditure plan was \nannounced to shore up the social safety net to protect the vulnerable groups \nand stimulate the economy. The announced countercyclical package totals \n$11 billion.  \n(i)  Increasing public expenditure. Generating employment will be given \npriority in public expenditure.  \n(ii)  Introducing a stimulus package through banks. Some low-interest \ncredit facilities will be launched through the banking system, mainly to \nrejuvenate economic activities.  \n(iii)  Widening social safety net coverage. Coverage of the existing social \nsafety net will be further widened to fulfill the basic needs of people living \nbelow the poverty line such as day laborers and people engaged in \nnonformal work. \nThe  Bangladesh  Bank  has  already  reduced  the  cash  reserve  ratio  and \nrepossess rate to boost monetary supply and exercised regulatory forbearance \nto keep the credit flowing. \n3. Preshock record of  Macroeconomic management was largely sound with high growth and \ngenerally sound  benign inflation before the pandemic. The economy grew 7.4% annually \n ", "Appendix 4  25 \n \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nmacroeconomic  during FY2015\u2013FY2019. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio was low at 34.9% in \nmanagement  FY2019. Inflation averaged 5.8% during FY2015\u2013FY2019, and the budget \ndeficit averaged 4.3% during the same period. The foreign exchange reserves \nwere $32.7 billion at the end of 2019. IMF Article IV consultation concluded in \nSeptember 2019 confirmed that \u201cBangladesh continues to achieve impressive \neconomic growth and social development.\u201d \n4. Structural reforms  The National Preparedness and Response Plan was adopted on 18 March \n2020 to guide the nation\u2019s health sector response. The COVID-19 Emergency \nOperation Center was set up at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control \nand Research under the Directorate General of Health Services to coordinate \nnationwide preparedness and response activities. Entry control and screening \nwas enforced, and testing was strengthened. The government also imposed \neffective social distancing measures, including the closure of public and private \nestablishments  and  suspension  of  public  transportation  services.  The \ncountercyclical economic package is being implemented by various agencies \nto stabilize the private sector and the financial market, provide a cash cushion \nfor the poor, and protect employment by supporting key industries and small \nand medium-sized enterprises. \n5. Debt sustainability  Public debt in Bangladesh was $105 billion in FY2019, around 34.9% of GDP, \nand the external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt ratio was 14.5% \nof GDP, both low. The additional external debt of $2.9 billion, as government \nprojected, will increase both the external PPG debt\u2013GDP ratio and public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio by 0.9% in FY2020. Bangladesh remains at low risk of debt \ndistress. \n6. Coordination with  ADB coordinates closely with the IMF on macroeconomic monitoring and \nInternational  participation  in  Article  IV  missions.  The  IMF  supports  ADB\u2019s  response \nMonetary Fund  measures  and  has  provided  an  assessment  letter  confirming  that \n(IMF)  Bangladesh\u2019s sustainable debt dynamics allow the authorities to increase \nexternal borrowings in response to the pandemic and Bangladesh remains at  \nlow risk of debt distress as assessed. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, \nIMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20200430173615+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "bangladesh, covid-19, coronavirus, covid-19 pandemic, adb covid-19 response, countercyclical support facility, cares program, public health, 54180-001, loan 3919, loan 3920, ta 9973, adb project, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200508160100+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.26", "Subject": "The proposed CARES program will provide financial support to the government to help mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe report and recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors (RRP) document describes the terms and conditions of a project for consideration and approval by ADB's Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nThis document dated April 2020 is provided for the ADB project 54180-001 in Bangladesh.", "Title": "COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program: Report and Recommendation of the President"}}
