There is a high potential for Pacific island countries to take full advantage of information \nand communication technology (ICT) in addressing their unique development challenges. Their \ngeographic isolation and associated high transport and communication costs have left most \nPacific island countries economically isolated from regional and international markets. These \nfactors also limit the provision of basic services to remote areas and outer islands. \n \n2.  Recognizing the potential of ICT, there is growing interest among the Pacific island \ncountries to invest in ICT infrastructure. Several fiber optic submarine cable backbones have \nbeen installed in the region and more opportunities are being explored. Regional initiatives have \nbeen created to strengthen national capacity and promote regional cooperation on ICT growth.1 \nIn 2010, the Framework for Action on ICT for Development in the Pacific was formulated to \nguide future actions in key areas such as policy, legislation, and regulatory frameworks; human \ncapacity building; and infrastructure and access.  \n \n3.  To fully exploit ICT opportunities and potential, Pacific island countries should have \nsufficient capacity to objectively analyze the costs and benefits of available investment options, \nand to make informed decision during negotiations. At the same time, the countries need to \ndevelop institutional, policy, and human resource capacity to effectively manage and utilize ICT-\nenabled services, so that social and economic benefits are maximized. Recent ICT-related \ninitiatives and investments in the Pacific offer valuable lessons to help develop approaches for \nplanning future institutional development initiatives and evaluating new investments.2 Earlier ICT \ninitiatives  helped  prepare  sector  analysis,  reviewed  ICT  policy  and  conducted  project \npreparatory  related  assessments,  piloted  health  information  systems,  and  supported  the \nintegration of government databases. The demand-driven approach and close consultations \nwith host governments led to successful delivery of these outputs. ADB continues to receive \nrequests from Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) to assist in addressing challenges \nthey face. The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) will serve as a facility \nto support Pacific DMCs in making informed and strategic decisions on ICT investment and use \nthat optimize the benefits of connectivity.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Current service access. To some extent, reforms and increased competition in the ICT \nmarket in many Pacific island countries have improved access to and availability of services, \nand reduced their price over the last 5 years. Approximately 60% of the Pacific population has \naccess to mobile phones. However, the penetration level ranges from less than 10 subscribers \nper 100 inhabitants in Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands to 71 subscribers per \n100 inhabitants in Fiji.4 Internet access remains a challenge with less than 30 internet users per \n100  inhabitants,  and  broadband  services  accessible  to  less  than  5  subscriptions  per  100 \n                                                \n1  ICT regional initiatives include Communication Action Plan (approved in 1999), Pacific Islands ICT Policy and \nPlan (approved in 2002), and Pacific Plan Digital Strategy approved in 2005.  \n2  ADB. 2009.

Low investment in ICT infrastructure has kept service costs very high, \nas  services  continue  to  rely  on  obsolete  hardware  and  equipment,  as  well  as  insufficient \ntelecommunications bandwidth. Pacific island countries are dependent on satellite as the main \nbandwidth provider despite the expense and low speed of this form of coverage. High monthly \nfees for basic broadband (256 kilobits per second), ranging from $25 to $1,000, deprive most of \nthe population of internet access.5 Downstream ICT applications and use across sectors, such \nas  e-government,  e-commerce,  e-health,  and  e-education,  are  either  nonexistent  or  at  an \nembryonic stage. Communities in remote areas and outer islands face the greatest challenge in \naccessing telecommunications and internet services.  \n \n5.  Monopoly in telecommunications market. Most countries in the Pacific have a public \nsector  monopoly,  if  not  a  joint  public\u2013private  venture,  in  the  telecommunications  market. \nIssuance of multiple licenses to telecommunications and internet service providers has not been \nsuccessful,  because  the  new  entrants  have  been  unable  to  negotiate  acceptable \ninterconnection terms. Only 6 of the 14 Pacific DMCs have introduced competition in internet or \nmobile services.6 Those without competition tend to have smaller populations, except Kiribati \nand the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).  \n \n6.  Human resources and institutional capacity. The human resources and institutional \ncapacity in ICT remains limited in the Pacific. Challenges identified during the Pacific ICT \nSurvey 2002 remain valid and need to be addressed.7 These include (i) limited access to \ntraining on information infrastructure (e.g., computers and internet) for individuals, social service \nfacilities, and organizations; (ii) unequal opportunity for ICT training, especially for women; (iii) \nlimited budgetary allocations and high costs of ICT training; and (iv) difficulties in retaining \nqualified  personnel,  if  any.  Some  progress  has  been  made  since  2009  with  support  from \ninternational agencies and aid programs.8 Nevertheless, much remains to be done to keep up \nwith the rapid pace of advancements in ICT.  \n \n7.  Incomplete or outdated policy and regulatory framework. Reforms are progressing \nin telecommunications and ICT policies. Most Pacific island countries have recently enacted \ntelecommunications legislation, although some countries have not begun to reform outdated \nand incomplete legislation in the telecommunications sector. The delays are partly due to the \nlong process of making policy changes, lack of capacity, and resource constraints. Only 6 of the \n14 DMCs have a national ICT policy.9  \n \n8.   All Pacific DMCs will be eligible for assistance under the TA upon request.10 The initial \nfocus will be on the Cook Islands, the FSM, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and \nTonga, all of which have requested ADB\u2019s support for their ICT development.

Solomon Islands is \ndeveloping a national ICT policy and strategic plan.   \n10  Additional financing may be sourced with increased country demands. No TA funds will be disbursed for any \nsubproject without ADB obtaining approval or a certificate of no objection from the Pacific DMCs for the TA and \nthe subcomponents to be financed thereunder.  \n ", "  3 \nshare fundamental ICT challenges in different degrees and forms. They need to quickly develop \nbasic capacity to assess, plan, and capture ICT investment opportunities and make strategic \ndecisions on ICT development based on a sufficient understanding of the opportunities and \nconstraints in the sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased  economic opportunities and improved service delivery \nthrough ICT in the Pacific.  The outcome will be enhanced government capacity and leadership \nin ICT development in selected Pacific DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  To respond to the fundamental requirements of ICT development, the TA\u2019s focus will \ninclude  supporting  the  following  core  priority  areas  essential  to  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for ICT development and utilization: \n \n(i)  ICT legislative and regulatory frameworks that are relevant and appropriate to the \nmarket size and capacity. \n(ii)  Feasible ICT investment plans that are technically sound and environmentally \nand socially acceptable. \n(iii)  Capacity to manage the ICT sector in the use and application of ICT as well as \nongoing enhancement of institutional and regulatory capacity to promote open, \nnondiscriminatory access to ICT. \n \n11.  Output  1.  Demand-driven  ICT  technical  advice,  assessment,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Technical expertise, assessment, diagnostics, and other analytical work and \ncapacity building activities will be provided to Pacific DMCs to permit informed decisions and \nnegotiations in (i) designing policy and regulatory framework, (ii) devising investment options, \nand (iii) using and applying ICT in public and social service delivery.11 This will also cover \ncollection and maintenance of accurate data required for policy formulation, regulation, and ICT \ninvestment planning. These activities will be undertaken with the engagement of government \nstaff and national institutions, through on-the-job training as well as participation in appropriate \ntraining opportunities, to help build country capacity and create a cadre of national staff who are \nfamiliar  with  the  critical  elements  of  preparing  ICT  investments.  ADB  will  evaluate  all \ngovernment requests under this output. Requests should be linked to ongoing or immediate \nnational ICT investments and programs within the core TA priority areas and should be outside \nthe  scope  of  ongoing assistance  by  other  development  partners.12 A mapping  exercise  to \n                                                \n11  The TA will supplement three ADB regional technical assistance projects (see footnote 2) in assisting the \npreparation of ICT investments for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Palau (environmental and social \nimpact assessment and economic, poverty, and gender assessment); Samoa (environmental and social impact \nassessment,  economic,  poverty  and  gender  assessment,  and  consultative  workshops);  Timor-Leste  (initial \nanalytical and due diligence work); and Solomon Islands and Tonga for additional analytical work as needed.   \n12  The World Bank, in partnership with the Australian Agency for International Development, the New Zealand \nAgency for International Development, and the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility, has also been supporting \nPacific island countries in ICT development. It has ongoing TA projects on telecommunications regulatory \nassistance, and ICT development at the regional and country level, such as in Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the FSM, \nPalau, and Timor-Leste; an ICT development project in Kiribati; a rural communications project in Papua New \nGuinea; an ICT sector development policy operation in the Marshall Islands; and an operation to support ICT \n ", "4   \ndetermine country e-readiness will be undertaken at the beginning of the project with assistance \nfrom the ongoing TA being administered by ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment.13 The outcome of this exercise is expected to inform the countries and ADB on \npotential areas for support.14  \n \n12.  Output  2.  Knowledge  production  and  management  on  ICT  development \nexperience.  The  TA  will  take  stock  of  lessons  learned  from  ICT  legislative  and  policy \nformulation, infrastructure investment experience, and ICT application and human resource \ncapacity development in the Pacific. Although there are several sources of information on ICT \n(e.g., handbooks and publications) in other countries and regions, there is little information on \nthe Pacific.15 The TA will produce a compendium of the key lessons from Pacific experience, as \nwell as examples and practices elsewhere that are most relevant in the Pacific context. The \ncompendium will be consolidated as a practical, user-friendly guidebook to be disseminated to \npolicy makers, line ministries, and ICT practitioners. This output is also expected to inform the \nprivate sector and development partners on issues related to facilitating ICT investment, and \nformulating and adopting ICT policies. The guidebook will be developed in consultation with \nintended users to ensure that the approaches advocated are practical.16 Associated activities \nthrough this component will also help increase awareness of other countries\u2019 activities, and \nincrease links and networking for future collaboration.    \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.4 million, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The governments \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of office space, and administrative and coordination \nsupport for the consultants. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  consultant  recruitment  and \nprocurement in close consultation with participating governments. Concurrence will be sought \nfrom  participating  governments  for  shortlisting  of  consultants.  The  focal  agency  in  each \nparticipating country, together with consultants, will implement the TA. ADB\u2019s main government \ncounterpart in each country will assist ADB in identifying the TA focal agency based on the \nscope  of  the  government\u2019s  requests.  The  participating  governments  will  mobilize  key \n                                                                                                                                                       \nregulatory development in Solomon Islands. ADB has been collaborating with the World Bank in a prospective ICT \nproject in the FSM, Palau, and Samoa, which could be potentially supported by this TA.  \n13  ADB. 2013. Midterm Review of the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. Manila (TA 8396). \n14   Preliminary mapping of the status of priority countries has been prepared and is available upon request. \n15  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  and  InfoDev  websites  are  the  major  sources  of  information, \nhandbooks, and toolkits on various topics and discussions on ICT. The most prevalent themes refer to ICT use \nand application, and legislative and regulatory issues discussed at the broader and increasingly country level. \nSpecifically, InfoDev, in cooperation with the ITU, developed an ICT regulation toolkit to help regulators design \neffective and enabling regulatory frameworks where lessons applicable to the Pacific could be drawn. ITU \nreleased an e-readiness and assessment framework in preparing for an e-government implementation toolkit. This \nframework could serve as a useful reference in preparing the ICT guidebook in the Pacific context. Publications on \nICT in small states mostly deal with the topics of e-governance or ICT application in public services (e.g., M. \nEdgardo, ed. 2008. Small States, Smart Solution. Improving Connectivity and Increasing the Effectiveness of \nPublic Services. World Bank, Washington, DC; Commonwealth Secretariat. 2013. E-governance in Small States. \nLondon). \n16  Other  dissemination  platforms,  such  as  social  media  and  web-based  applications  where  feasible,  will  be \ndeveloped in consultation with participating governments. \n ", "  5 \ngovernment staff and national organizations to participate in undertaking analytical work and \nother  technical  advice  through  on-the-job  experience  or  appropriate  training  to  help  build \ncountry  capacity for ICT  development.  Close coordination  will  be  maintained  with  resident \nmissions, other development partners, and the Pacific Islands Forum during TA implementation.    \n \n15.  The  proposed  TA  will  finance  up  to  33  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 40 person-months of national consulting services. A combination of individual \nconsultant selection and indefinite delivery contracts (IDCs) for consulting firms will be used in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The consultants will consist of ICT technical specialists as primary experts, including \nfinancial, business, legal, social, environmental, gender expertise, and other experts as required. \nThe experts will have experience in their respective fields and demonstrate sound technical \nknowledge of ICT business. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented \nover 48 months, commencing on 13 January 2014.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.
