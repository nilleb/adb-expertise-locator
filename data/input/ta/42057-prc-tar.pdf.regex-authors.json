INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the Country Programming Mission in December 2007, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for China Clean Development Mechanism Fund \nCapacity Development. The TA has been included in the ADB nonlending pipeline for the PRC \nfor  2008. 1  This  report  is  based  on  the  understanding  reached  with  the  China  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism Fund (CCDMF) regarding the impact, outcome, methodology and key \nactivities, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  PRC  signed  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change \n(UNFCCC) in 1991, and ratified the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC in 2002. As a developing \nparticipating country of the UNFCCC, the PRC is eligible to benefit from the clean development \nmechanism (CDM) established under the Kyoto Protocol. The CDM is designed to promote a \nwin-win solution between developed and developing countries in addressing global climate \nchange; project owners in developing countries may register certified emissions reductions \n(CERs) that can then be sold to counterparts from developed countries. Such market-based \nCER transactions enable entities in developed countries to achieve their mandatory targets for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions from 1995 level at a lower cost. The PRC has the potential \nto generate about 50% of the total worldwide annual CERs. The Government considers the \nCDM as an important mechanism for (i) extending financial support and new technology from \ndeveloped countries to complement its own efforts to promote sustainable development, and \n(ii) addressing climate change concerns on both national and international basis.  \n \n3.  ADB has been providing ongoing support to the PRC for CDM capacity development \nand has implemented a number of early CDM projects. In 2000, a TA prepared sample CDM \ndocuments for six typical projects;2 in 2002, a TA identified specific opportunities for CDM \nprojects.3 In 2005, ADB\u2019s CDM facility successfully brokered the CERs from an ADB-funded \nproject for utilizing coal mine methane, and the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, under the Carbon \nMarket Initiative, purchased CERs from another ADB-funded hydropower project.4 Two other \nADB-funded projects successfully signed contracts directly with other buyers of CERs.5 The \nabove projects promoted sustainable development in the PRC and enhanced global efforts to \naddress climate change issues. \n \n4.  In 2005, the PRC introduced a levy on the CER revenues generated by various types of \nCDM  projects  and  established  a  specialized  facility\u2014the  CCDMF\u2014to  manage  the  levies \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 September 2008.  \n2  ADB. 2000.

The  CDM  levy  is  an \ninnovation to enhance the rationale and integrity of the CDM as a partnership for promoting \nsustainable  development.  ADB  provided  earlier  TA  to  help  the  newly  established  CCDMF \nprepare initial operational guidelines and procedures;6 the deliverables included (i) the draft \ndecree and guidelines on the CDM fee collection mechanism; (ii) a draft policy paper for the \ninternal  control  and  governance  structure;  (iii)  a  draft  operations  manual  for  day-to-day \noperation of the CCDMF; and (iv) materials for capacity development, information dissemination, \nand a public awareness program. The activities and workshops envisaged under the TA have \nbeen completed, except for a training program that is planned in December 2008.  \n \n5.  Now that the CCDMF has started collecting levy\u2014expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2012, \nthe  end  of  Kyoto  Protocol  period\u2014the  CCDMF  staff  require  capacity  building  for  fund \nmanagement and investment. Training will need to extend to other stakeholders, including \nofficials at provincial level who process proposals for CDM projects and other climate change-\nrelated activities. \n \n6.  Climate change is not only an environmental problem but also a critical development \nissue. Its adverse impacts will disproportionally affect the poor, as they are most reliant on their \ndirect natural environment. In its long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),7 \nADB has identified the environment, including climate change, as one of strategic priorities to \npursue its mission to help its developing member countries reduce poverty and improve living \nconditions and quality of life. ADB recently established the Climate Change Fund and Future \nCarbon Fund to help developing member countries implement projects that can contribute to \nclimate change mitigation and energy security. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC \n2008\u201320108 has also emphasized environmental sustainability. Like many other countries, the \nPRC has recognized that it is facing imminent and severe climate change challenges, and has \ninitiated several measures to tackle these challenges. The 2007 National Climate Change \nProgramme of the PRC specifically requires assistance from international partners to mitigate \nthe effects of climate change. There is strong and clear consistency between the strategic \npriorities of ADB and the PRC in this sector. The proposed TA will be a concrete step to \nstrengthen this strategic linkage. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the PRC \nand mitigation of global climate change impacts. The outcome will be a strengthened capacity of \nthe CCDMF for promoting and supporting climate change-related projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  To achieve the TA outcome and contribute to the TA impact, the following outputs will be \ndelivered:     \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006.

Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, of which $300,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program and $500,000 by the Climate Change Fund, all on a grant basis. The grant to \nbe provided by the Climate Change Fund will be front-loaded at the relevant TA contract \n ", "4   \ncommitment level. The Government will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to $200,000, \nthrough the provision of in-kind contribution by the CCDMF in the form of office accommodation, \nlogistic facilities, interpretation services, and remuneration of counterpart staff. The Fact-Finding \nMission  was  assured by  the  Government  that  the  relevant  counterpart  contribution  by  the \nCCDMF will be available as required according to the implementation schedule of the TA.  The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The CCDMF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA and will help coordinate with \nthe relevant government offices, as necessary. The CCDMF has already nominated project \nmanagement office staff, who will guide and support consultants on a day-to-day basis.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from March 2009 to August 2010. The \nestimated allocation of consulting services will be two international consultants, including a fund \nmanagement specialist and a financial specialist (5 person-months in total); and nine national \nconsultants,  including  two  fund  management  specialists,  two  financial  specialists,  an  MIS \nspecialist, two legal counsels, a safeguards specialist, and a training specialist (33 person-\nmonths in total). The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The use of consultants is needed under this TA, and different components will be \nimplemented using different consultant selection approaches. For outputs 1, 3, and 4, ADB, in \nconsultation  with  the  EA,  will  select  and  engage  consultants  through  a  consulting  firm  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using the quality- (80%) and cost-based (20%) selection method. Because the TA outputs \nare going to cover the new areas of CCDMF activities, a suitable review panel of external \nexperts will be engaged to participate in the relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars \nheld  under  the  TA,  and  to  comment  on  relevant  consultants\u2019  reports.  Training  programs, \nseminars,  workshops,  and  a  study  tour  will  be  conducted  through  the  consulting  services \ncontract.  Conferences  will  be  administered  through  the  EA.  For  output  2,  a  suitable \ncommercially available software package will be purchased and modified, as necessary, to \nsatisfy  the  MIS  needs  of  the  CCDMF.  The  software  should  include  modules  for  office \nadministration,  project  management,  risk  control,  project  performance  evaluation,  human \nresource  management,  financial  management,  and  contract  management.  In  case  minor \nchanges are needed to accommodate all the requirements, the software vendor will be required \nto carry them out as part of the initial support service. The MIS specialist (national consultant for \ncomponent 2) will help prepare the specifications of the MIS software, and procure and evaluate \nthe  performance  of  the  program;  in  case  changes  to  be  made  are  significant,  additional \nconsulting  services  will  be  used  and  the  price  of  the  software  adjusted  accordingly.  The \nprocurement of all commercial software and equipment under the TA will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Upon \ncompletion of the TA, all software and equipment procured will be turned over to the CCDMF. \nTA funds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2008, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  All TA deliverables and progress reports should address all aspects of the terms of \nreference  for  consultants  and  will  be  written  in  English  and  translated  into  Chinese.  The \nconsultants will maintain close working relations with ADB and the CCDMF. Tripartite meetings \namong ADB staff, the CCDMF, and the consultants will be held periodically to provide guidance \nto the consultants and to review their reports.  \n ", "  5\n \nIV.
