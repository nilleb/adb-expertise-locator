The country strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Viet Nam \nidentifies improving the quality of human resources, removing inequities in access to healthcare, \nand reducing poverty as the key challenges for the country. During the Country Strategy and \nProgramming Mission in 2003, the Government requested an advisory technical assistance (TA) \nfor strengthening its pro-poor health policies.1 A fact-finding mission visited Viet Nam from 2 to 6 \nFebruary 2004 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA.2 The Mission held \nconsultations with the concerned Government ministries, and various multilateral and bilateral \norganizations. The TA is included in the country pipeline for 2004. A logical framework for the TA \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite the substantial progress during the past 10 years, poverty reduction is still a \nmajor challenge for policymakers in Viet Nam. Poor health and expenditure on health care are \nimportant causes of poverty in the country. High healthcare costs result in indebtedness and the \nloss of productive assets for many families. In addition, many chronic health conditions restrict \nphysical and mental activity, raising the effective dependency burden in Vietnamese households \naffected by poor health and disability. Premature death from illness, accidents, and injuries \ndisadvantages many households. Households headed by females without another adult present \nare particularly disadvantaged. Not surprisingly, inequities in the use of health services have \nbeen increasing in recent years.3 \n \n3.  Limited public resources have forced the Government to rely increasingly on household \nout-of-pocket financing, especially for curative care. High out-of-pocket costs have hampered \npoor households\u2019 abilities to obtain needed healthcare. Several households have had to cope \nwith catastrophic healthcare costs. Such costs are an important cause of poverty. In addition, \nassociated disabilities negatively affect household income and assets. \n \n4.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS) \nrecognizes that it is not enough to make healthcare physically accessible to all segments of the \npopulation.  Out-of-pocket  costs  and  other  barriers\u2014for  example,  travel  costs  and  the \nopportunity cost of time\u2014often prevent the poor from using available health services. The Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Decision  1394  to  establish  province-level  health  care  funds  for  the  poor  is  an \nimportant step to reduce direct costs as an obstacle to healthcare use by the poor. However, \nreductions in direct costs alone may not suffice to eliminate existing differentials in healthcare \nuse. Furthermore, Decision 139 covers only the poor people, leaving a vast numbers of near \npoor households still exposed to the risk of catastrophic healthcare expenditure.  \n \n5.  The Government faces a two-pronged challenge of effectively implementing Decision \n139 and ensuring that the intended benefits reach the intended groups. At the same time, it \nneeds to continue to further refine its health financing policies to provide coverage to the \nremaining population, especially households just above the poverty line.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The concept paper for the technical assistance was approved by Management in February 2004. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 September 2003. \n3   Bhushan, I., E. Bloom, N. Thang, N. Huu. 2001. Human Capital of the Poor in Viet Nam. Manila: ADB. \n4   The Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg, \u201cHealth Care for the Poor\u201d (15 October 2002). ", "2  \n6.  The  success  of  Decision  139  depends  critically  on  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \ninstitutionalize a system of close monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of implementation and \nimpact of the policy. The Government needs to constantly monitor the coverage of the funds in \nterms of the characteristics of households and individuals reached. Monitoring will also be \nimportant to assess the quality and adequacy of services being provided to the beneficiaries. \nThe impact of the policy initiative on health care service use and out-of-pocket expenditure by \npoor households will also need to be assessed. The TA will support the Ministry of Health \n(MOH) by strengthening its capacity to manage and monitor the implementation of Decision 139 \nat the central and local (provincial and district) levels. It will also support the development of a \nplan for monitoring the impact of Decision 139.  \n \n7.  Further refining the health financing policies\u2014to more effectively cover the poor and \nexpand the support to near-poor populations\u2014will require a deeper understanding of the linkage \nbetween poverty and health, determinants of health care use, and the barriers faced by the poor \n\u2014particularly ethnic minorities and women\u2014in seeking health care. Policy research is also \nneeded to better understand how cost influences the health care seeking behavior, especially \nby poor people and ethnic minorities living in rural and remote areas. These insights can help \ndetermine policy changes for increasing healthcare use by the poor and expanding health \ninsurance coverage among the large, presently uncovered, rural population. This analysis can \nprovide the basis for modifying Decision 139 to improve its focus and effectiveness. It will also \nhelp suggest appropriate modifications of the health insurance policies to achieve the stated \ngoal of universal coverage by 2010.5 The TA will finance necessary policy research to support \ngovernment  efforts  for  increasing  use  of  cost-effective  healthcare  by  the  poor  and  other \nvulnerable groups while simultaneously reducing their financial burden. \n \n8.  The TA builds directly on two previous ADB health sector projects, Human Capital of the \nPoor in Viet Nam: Policy Options, and Making Health Care More Affordable for the Poor: Health \nFinancing in Viet Nam.6 The TA will also support two other ongoing health sector projects, the \nRural  Health  Project  and  the  Health  Care  in  the  Central  Highlands  Project.7  The  TA  will \ncomplement health sector work of several other aid agencies, including the expansion of rural \nhealth insurance coverage. The TA outputs will directly support the objectives of ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy and program for Viet Nam and the CPRGS, which identify reducing out-of-pocket \nexpenditure on health care as a challenge for poverty reduction. The TA is also in line with \nADB\u2019s Health Sector Policy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to support the pro-poor health sector policies in Viet Nam by (i) \nstrengthening the capacity of MOH in effectively implementing Decision 139; and (ii) attaining \n                                                 \n5\n Both the socioeconomic plan adopted by the Ninth Party Congress and the 10-year plan for the health sector \napproved by the Prime Minister call for expanding health financing options to gradually extend basic health care \ncoverage to the entire population by 2010. \n6\n  ADB. 2000.

In particular, the TA will \nstrengthen the monitoring and evaluation system for Decision 139 and support training for \nofficials responsible for implementing the decision at the central and state levels. In addition, the \nTA will support policy research on the following issues: \n \n(i)  Health and poverty in Viet Nam, \n(ii)  Barriers to health care utilization by the poor,  \n(iii)  Determinants of health care costs, and  \n(iv)  Demand for health insurance among rural population. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have two components: (i) capacity building for implementing Decision 139, \nand (ii) policy research to improve the poverty focus of health financing. \n \n1.  Component 1: Capacity Building \n \n11.  Component 1 will support the implementation of Decision 139, especially its monitoring \nand evaluation. The TA will support the further development, pretesting, and installation of the \nmonitoring and reporting software for Decision 139 that was initiated under the ADB financed \nTA No. 3877-VIE, Making Health Care More Affordable for the Poor: Health Financing in Viet \nNam. The TA will finance training of provincial and district officials in the use of the software as \nwell as in other areas.  The TA will also assist MOH to develop the methodology and a plan for \nassessing the impact of Decision 139 on healthcare use and household out-of-pocket spending. \nThe TA will complement the activities planned under Loan 2076-VIE: Health Care in the Central \nHighlands Project. The monitoring and evaluation methodology developed under the TA will be \nused in the project to assess the impact of Decision 139 in achieving its objectives in the central \nhighlands using project resources. The methodology could also be used by MOH using its own \nresources to assess the impact of Decision 139 in other parts of the country.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Policy Research \n \n12.  Component 2 will entail four policy research studies. \n \n(i)  Health and poverty. This study will focus on relationships between health status \n(disability and morbidity), and labor supply and productivity and household wealth \nand indebtedness. There is broad understanding and appreciation in Viet Nam of \nthe role that high healthcare costs play in generating poverty. Several studies8 \nhave been prepared on the \u201chealth poverty trap.\u201d However, less is understood \nabout  the  role  that  poor  health  and  disability  plays  in  adversely  affecting \nhouseholds\u2019 ability to earn income. Solid evidence on this relationship is lacking \nworldwide, reflecting in part the relative dearth of attention to adult health issues. \nThe study will fill this important gap. The study will also explore the gender \ndimensions of the relationships between health and poverty.  \n \n                                                 \n8\n  Dahlgren, Goran. 2000.

Melbourne: University of Melbourne. \n ", "4  \n(ii)  Barriers to healthcare use. This study will identify the barriers to healthcare use \nby the poor and other vulnerable groups. In particular, the study will assess the \nrole played by indirect costs, such as travel costs and the opportunity cost of \ntime. This is potentially very important because the available data suggest that \nsignificant differentials in healthcare use exist between the poor and the non-\npoor, independent of health insurance coverage. Knowledge of factors that affect \nuse is critical for formulating appropriate strategies to provide effective access to \nhealth care for the poor. \n \n(iii)  Factors  affecting  the  cost  of  healthcare  to  households.  This  study  will \nexamine  how  out-of-pocket  costs  and  the  opportunity  costs  of  time  vary \naccording to the type of provider used, provider fee levels, local drug costs, \nhealth  insurance  coverage,  eligibility  for  fee  exemptions,  and  other  relevant \nfactors. Several household surveys have collected data on the cost of healthcare \nto households at various types of public and private health facilities. In addition to \nthe obvious roles played by the type and seriousness of an illness or injury, the \ntype of provider consulted, and the quantity of care obtained, the direct cost of \nhealthcare to households may be affected by a number of additional factors, \nincluding health insurance coverage of various kinds, patient eligibility for fee \nexemptions  and  fee  reductions,  the  degree  of  competition  among  providers, \npublic and private, local prices of drugs, and quality of care. The indirect cost of \nhealthcare  (i.e.,  travel  costs,  opportunity  cost  of  patient  time)  is  affected  by \ndistance, access to and cost of transportation, and wage rates. The study will aim \nto quantify the determinants of health care costs.  \n \n(iv)  The  demand  for  health  insurance.  This  study  will  identify  the  factors  that \ninfluence the demand for health insurance in Viet Nam. The factors are likely to \ninclude cost and expected benefits, access to and quality of healthcare, and \nknowledge of health insurance. The study findings will be useful for policies to \nexpand  the  health  insurance  coverage,  in  particular  the  voluntary  health \ninsurance. \n \n13.  The four studies will be based on existing survey data (for example, the 1997\u20131998 \nVietnam Living Standards Survey, 2002 Demographic and Health Survey, and the 2001\u20132002 \nVietnam National Health Survey). Quantitative analysis will be supplemented by findings from a \nparticipatory  rapid  assessment  to  be  conducted  through  a  nongovernment  organization. \nResearch design for the assessment will cover issues related to all four studies. Suggested \noutlines of the studies are in Appendix 2. The main findings and recommendations of these \nstudies will be summarized in a final report and presented in a workshop organized by MOH. \nThe  workshop  will  include  representatives  of  relevant  departments  in  MOH;  interested \ninternational agencies; Viet Nam Social Insurance and other Government agencies involved in \nformulating health financing policy (for example, the ministries of planning and investment, and \nfinance); representatives of mass movement organizations; and nongovernment organizations \ninvolved in the health sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $640,000  equivalent,  of  which  $500,000 \nequivalent  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  component  of \n$230,000 and the local currency cost of $270,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB \non a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. ADB will finance consulting \n ", "  5\nservices, production of reports, workshops, studies, and some administrative support services. \nThe Government's contribution to the TA, estimated at $140,000 equivalent, will be in kind and \nwill include the provision of counterpart staff; office accommodation; office support; translation \nservices; and the support for organizing seminars, workshops, and meetings. The detailed cost \nestimates and proposed financing arrangements are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MOH will be the Executing Agency. The Health Policy Unit under the Department of \nPlanning and Finance of MOH will be directly responsible for the day-to-day implementation of \nthe TA. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with Component 3 of 2076-VIE: \nHealth Care in the Central Highlands Project.9 A team comprising one international consultant \nand team leader (12 person-months) and six domestic consultants (68 person-months) will be \nrecruited on individual basis to provide specialist services. Outline terms of reference of the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. The services of the consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  An  international  consultant  (with  a \nsociology  background)  engaged  under  the  Health  Care  in  the  Central  Highlands  Project \nfinanced by Swedish Government will also support the TA implementation. \n  \n16.  The steering committee for 2076-VIE: Health Care in the Central Highlands Project, \nchaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  MOH,  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  the  TA  and  ensure \ncoordination with ministries and agencies concerned. The TA team will present the progress of \nthe study to the steering committee at regular intervals and seek its feedback and guidance. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, starting in July 2004 and finishing in June \n2006. The TA team leader will submit a draft inception report to ADB and MOH within 1 month \nfrom the commencement of the TA. The inception report will describe the study design, sources \nof data, and time schedule of each output. An interim report will be submitted after 1 year, and a \nfinal report by May 2006. \n \nIV.
