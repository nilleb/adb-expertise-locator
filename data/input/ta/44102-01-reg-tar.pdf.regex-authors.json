INTRODUCTION \n1.  Solar energy has been regarded as one of the fastest growing electricity technologies in \nrecent  years.  Changes  in  technology,  cost  structure,  enabling  policies,  and  regulatory \nframeworks have driven this spectacular growth in developed countries. Solar energy has great \nsignificance  for  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  because  \n(i)  economies  of  scale  can  reduce  costs  to  make  solar  energy  competitive  with  the  grid;  \n(ii) some DMCs have greater solar radiation, more rapidly growing electricity demand, and more \navailability of land than developed countries; and, as a result, (iii) DMCs have the potential to \nbecome global and regional technology manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and \nequipment.  \n \n2.  Strategy 20201 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) outlines the following priorities:  \n(i) realizing environmentally sustainable growth for Asia and the Pacific; (ii) expanding ADB's \npromotion  of,  and  investment  in,  sound  environmental  management,  while  simultaneously \ncapitalizing on ADB's operational strengths, such as infrastructure development and finance; \nand (iii) responding to climate change and supporting DMCs to move their economies onto  \nlow-carbon growth paths by expanding the use of clean energy. ADB's 2009 Energy Policy2 was \ndesigned  to  increase  its  role  in  renewable  energy  development  by  (i)  facilitating  wider \ntechnology deployment, (ii) raising awareness and promoting policy and regulatory incentives to \nencourage use of renewable energy, and (iii) promoting financing packages that share risks and \nlower costs. The Energy Policy includes maximizing access to energy for all as one of its three \npillars. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  While ADB has begun to process several solar energy and stable grid development3  \nprojects in line with the Energy Policy, the ADB solar technology team established under the \nenergy community of practice in September 2009 has identified several barriers to such projects. \nThese  include:  (i)  insufficient  concessional  and  secured  financing  mechanisms,  (ii)  slow \ntechnology transfer to DMCs, (iii) suboptimal capacity of DMCs to develop and implement \nsustainable policy and regulatory frameworks, and (iv) weak industry structures for solar energy \nand stable grid development.  \n \n4.  At an international workshop as the side event of the Copenhagen climate summit in \nDecember 2009, R. K. Pachauri, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \npresented a number of proposals to support ADB's work with DMCs to mainstream solar energy \ndevelopment: \n \n(i)  the  private  sector  should  play  a  major  role  in  combating  climate  change, \nespecially in solar energy development;  \n(ii)  developing  countries  should  have  a  policy  for  mainstreaming  solar  energy \ndevelopment  with  active  private  sector  participation  (e.g.,  the  National  Solar \nMission of India's National Action Plan on Climate Change); \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n3 Stable grid development is a critical factor for expanding loads of renewable energies. Therefore, the projects \ncombining solar energy and stable grid development are being processed together.   \n ", "2 \n(iii)  all  stakeholders\u2014developing  and  developed  country  agencies,  international \nagencies, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations\u2014should have extensive \ndialogue to identify issues, share perceptions and find  solutions; and \n(iv)  ADB should play a facilitation role by setting up a network for knowledge sharing.  \n \n5.  Strategy 2020 calls for knowledge solutions that will leverage ADB\u2019s central position in \nidentifying trends within and across the region, its interdisciplinary and integrated assistance \napproach,  and  its  capacity  to  implement  insight  and  knowledge  supported  by  significant \nfinancing. ADB, together with its development partners, is therefore in a position to play a \ncatalytic role in technology transfer facilitation and knowledge sharing for solar energy and \nstable grid development. As a regional knowledge institution, ADB is mandated to (i) support \npilot projects from which it will distill and disseminate lessons, and (ii) distribute knowledge in \nways that have both an immediate impact and catalytic force. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) aims to promote solar \nenergy and stable grid development in Asia and the Pacific. The TA will contribute to an \nunderstanding by all stakeholders of the potential for solar energy in the region, the key actions \nrequired to accelerate solar energy development, the institutional and business models for \ndevelopment  and  deployment,  and  the  mechanisms  to  promote  technology  transfer  to \ndeveloping countries and to enhance the scope for cooperation on research and development \n(R&D).  \n \n7.  This initiative will cover (i) large scale solar photovoltaic (SPV) and solar thermal projects, \n(ii) grid-connected distributed SPV projects, (iii) off-grid solar power generation projects, (iv) \nstable  grid  development  projects  using  batteries  and  two-way  meters,  and  (v)  associated \ntechnologies, e.g., lithium-ion batteries, plug-in electric vehicles.4 In order to mainstream such \nprojects, a well-organized and systematic knowledge management program will be critical and \nwill need to involve (i) DMC governments, (ii) private sector and R&D agencies, and (ii) donor \ncountries and development partners.  \n \n8.  Through  the  knowledge  management  program,  DMC  governments  will  be  able  to \n(i) promote foreign direct investment by international private companies; (ii) facilitate technology \ntransfer by matching domestic and foreign private companies, e.g., manufacturers, developers, \nsuppliers, and financiers; (iii) mobilize concessional funding from development partners and \ndeveloped countries to structure financially viable projects; (iv) formulate and implement an \noptimal solar policy and regulatory framework so that many private sector enterprises can enter \nthe  market;  and  (v)  receive  capacity  development  support  from  developed  countries  and \ndevelopment partners. \n \n9.  The private sector will be able to: (i) have access to DMC government policy makers,  \n(ii) acquire the latest information on DMC market development, (iii) develop consortia with \nforeign  and  domestic  enterprises,  and  (iv)  approach  development  partners  and  developed \ncountry governments to provide financial and technical assistance with which the bankable \nprojects can be developed. The knowledge management program will also be beneficial for \nADB and its development partners as they will be able to (i) promote regional and national \npolicy dialogue, (ii) tailor lending and guarantee operations to DMCs and the private sector,  \n(iii) develop effective technical assistance to match the needs of DMCs and the private sector, \n                                                 \n4 Includes small projects in the Pacific islands. \n ", "3 \nand (iv) share best practices. The overview of knowledge solar energy ad grid development \noperation is in Appendix 2. \n   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The expected impact of the TA is sustainable solar energy and stable grid development \nin Asia and the Pacific for inclusive and low-carbon economic growth. The expected outcome is \nneeds assessment and pilot programs conducted for knowledge management to promote solar \nenergy and stable grid development in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will conduct a comprehensive needs assessment for a knowledge platform and \npilot programs for solar energy and stable grid management in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n12.  The  impact  of  the  knowledge  management  platform  will  be  maximized  by  (i)  the \nparticipation of a large number of stakeholders, among others, from Europe and North America  \nwhere  commercial  solar  power  generation  projects  are  already  being  actively  developed;  \n(ii) regular international workshops and capacity development programs in the region, with \ncollaboration from other development partners; and (iii) the establishment of an institutional \nknowledge  network  connecting  the  region  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  adding  value  through \ninvestment,  optimizing  implementation  arrangements,  achieving  economies  of  scale,  and \ndeveloping unified approaches.  \n \n13.  The outputs for the proposed TA are as follows. \n \n(i)  A prefeasibility study5 of the knowledge management platform will be conducted. \nAs  an  initial  step,  a  consultant  will  identify  the  key  areas  where  knowledge \nmanagement can effectively facilitate solar energy and stable grid development \nin DMCs in Asia and Pacific. The consultant will identify barriers and solutions in \nthe  areas  of  (a)  technology  transfer,  (b)  innovative  financing,  (c)  policy  and \nregulatory frameworks, and (d) industries and market structures in DMCs. The \nconsultant will analyze the current knowledge management activities conducted \nby  global,  regional,  and  national  agencies,  nonprofit  organizations,  and \ninstitutions and  identify  quantitative  and  qualitative  gaps  between  knowledge \nsupply and demand. The consultant will deliver a prefeasibility report on an \nindependent,  not-for-profit,  nonpartisan,  and  nonpolitical  knowledge  platform \ninvolving ADB, its development partners, knowledge and financial providers, and \nDMC governments and private agencies.  \n \n(ii)  An international solar energy forum will be held with relevant partners, e.g., \nInternational  Energy  Agency,  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency \nPartnership,  and  United  Nations  Industry  Development  Organization. \nStakeholders will be invited to brainstorm and recommend specific measures to \novercome barriers to viable SPV, solar thermal, and distributed rooftop solar \npower projects and sustainable off-grid and mini-grid projects using batteries. \nThe  forum  is  scheduled  for  July  2010  in  Bangkok,  Thailand.  It  will  give  an \n                                                 \n5 Prefeasibility study will explore needs of development of a knowledge platform and  propose models while feasibility \nstudy will, based on the result of the prefeasibility study, will propose the detail design and implementation \narrangement of the most relevant model.    \n ", "4 \nopportunity (a) for DMCs to attract foreign direct investments; (b) for private \ncompanies from DMCs to meet foreign technology partners; (c) for international \nprivate companies to learn about policies and incentive packages; and (d) for \ndonor agencies to structure client oriented assistance. \n \n(iii)  A pilot regional capacity development and knowledge sharing program will be \nconducted to strengthen the capacity of DMCs to formulate and implement policy \nand  regulatory  frameworks  for  mainstreaming  solar  energy  and  stable  grid \ndevelopment.  The  program  will  be  hosted  by  the  Government  of  Japan  in \nSeptember 2010. Regional and nonregional private companies and agencies will \nbe invited to disseminate best practices. Several agencies in Japan will share the \ncosts of the program.  \n \n(iv)  A consultant will assist ADB to develop agreements with international agencies \nand  companies  to  collaborate  in  project  development  and  knowledge \nmanagement for solar energy and stable grid development. The target agencies \nwill  include  international  organizations,  donor  agencies,  private  sector \nassociations, and R&D institutes. In parallel, the consultant will promote South\u2013\nSouth cooperation. For example, the consultant will support knowledge providers \nin DMCs that have fairly well advanced policy development to share their best \npractices with other DMCs.  \n \n(v)  A  consultant  will  develop  and  conduct  an  outreach  program  to  disseminate \ninformation on activities in DMCs and on ADB's expanding operations in project \ndevelopment  and  knowledge  management  in  solar  energy  and  stable  grid \ndevelopment.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent on a grant basis funded by \nthe Asian Clean Energy Fund6 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA. The solar technology team under the \nenergy community of practice will supervise the work of the consultants in close coordination \nwith the Regional and Sustainable Development Department and other operational departments.  \n \n16.  The TA will require the services of three international consultants for 19 person-months \nand  two  national  consultants  for  8  person-months,  for  a  total  of  27  person-months.  The \ninternational consulting team will include an international solar energy knowledge management \nspecialist, an international solar business development specialist, an international renewable \noutreach  specialist,  a  national  logistics  coordinator,  and  a  national  training  specialist.  The \nconsultants will be separately recruited as individuals as flexibility is needed in sourcing a broad \nrange of specialists. ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.7    \n                                                 \n6 Established by the Government of Japan.  \n7 ADB. 2008.
