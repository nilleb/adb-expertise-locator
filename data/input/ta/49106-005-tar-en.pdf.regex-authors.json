The Government of India requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support the development of its regional rapid transit system (RRTS) network, particularly in the \nNational Capital Region (NCR). Out of the eight corridors constituting the RRTS network, three \npriority RRTS lines will connect Delhi with adjacent urban conglomerations of Ghaziabad\u2013Meerut \n(Uttar Pradesh), Gurugram\u2013Alwar (Haryana and Rajasthan) and Sonipat\u2013Panipat (Haryana). \n \n2.  The Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS line, approximately 82 km, with 68-km elevated and 14-km \nunderground track, is the most prepared, in terms of designs, with some contracts already \nawarded under government funding. The ADB financing will be used to develop the Delhi\u2013Meerut \nRRTS corridor. The tentative total cost for the project is estimated at $4,098 million.1 The National \nCapital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), the implementing agency of the ensuing project, \nis proposing a funding structure where about 50% of this amount will come from central and state \ncontributions, while $2,049 million will be financed by ADB.2  It will include civil works, alignment, \nformation, station buildings, multimodal hubs, depot and workshop, permanent way, traction and \npower supply, signaling and telecom, and automatic fare collection system.3 The corridor will be \ndeveloped in five overlapping stages: (i) construction of viaducts including stations for elevated \nsections; (ii) design and construction of tunnels for the underground sections; (iii) trackwork \ninstallation  and  traction  overhead  electrification;  (iv)  signaling  and  telecom  works;  and  (v) \nelectrical and mechanical works and architectural finishing work of stations. These stages will be \nfunded by a multitranche financing facility that will follow a time-sliced\u2013component approach. The \nensuing project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2020\u20132022,4 while the \nproposed transaction technical assistance subproject is not included.5  \n \n3.  The RRTS network would offer safe and world-class commuter transit services, expected \nto reduce commuter journey times in the region with high design speed (180 km per hour) and \nhigh frequency (5 to 10 minutes) operations. For nonstop journeys, the RRTS would allow \ndistances of 100 km in under 45\u201360 minutes. The project would also ensure the convenience of \nquality last-mile connectivity, addressing the needs of all categories of travelers on the network. \nThe network would be planned and spatially oriented to ensure seamless integration with other \ntransport modes in the region, including the Indian Railways, Delhi Metro, and interstate bus \nservices. Such seamless connectivity will reduce pollution and congestion in the NCR, thus driving \nbalanced and sustainable urban development in the region. The RRTS is a new type of rail-based \nurban transport in the NCR combining relatively high speeds, widely spaced stations and metro-\nlike operations. As such, relevant international good practices in all areas of development of the \nRRTS network are being sought for its successful implementation.  \n \n \n                                                \n1 The amount includes physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, interest, and other charges during \nimplementation.  \n2  The NCRTC is a joint special purpose vehicle between the Government of India and the four states of the project \nsites: Delhi-National Capital Territory, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Utter Pradesh. \n3  ADB financing will not include rolling stock. \n4 1ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2020\u20132022. Manila. Formerly Preparing Transport Sector \nProjects I. \n5  The proposed transaction technical assistance subproject has been discussed with the NCRTC in September 2019. \nThe  aide memoire  has been  submitted  for  the confirmation  of  the  Department  of Economic  Affairs  (DEA) \nsubsequently. The TA proposal was submitted to the DEA and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA), \nthe executing agency of the cluster technical assistance (C-TA) in early October 2019.  \n \n ", "2 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n4.  ADB  approved  on  4  November  2015  the  cluster  technical  assistance  (C-TA)  for \nStrengthening Climate Change Resilience in Urban India for $8.75 million, of which $7.0 million \nwas financed on a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) \nunder  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (UFPF)  and  administered  by  ADB.6 The \nDepartment of External Affairs (DEA) is the executing agency, which was later changed to the \nMinistry of Urban Development.7 On 18 March 2016, the DEA Steering Committee cleared the C-\nTA for implementation and on 16 June 2016, the list of subprojects under the C-TA was approved \nby the TA Steering Committee of the Ministry of Urban Development.8 On 12 September 2019, \nADB approved the extension of the completion date of the C-TA from 31 September 2019 to 30 \nOctober 2021 to allow the completion of the existing subprojects, and of the proposed Subproject \n3 which is the last subproject of the C-TA.  \n \n5.  The overall impact of the C-TA is urban climate change resilience in selected states in \nIndia mainstreamed. The expected outcome is capacity of government to successfully implement \nurban climate-change-resilient projects enhanced. The expected outputs are: (i) climate change \nresilience in urban policies and plans mainstreamed; (ii) climate change resilience of infrastructure \nand project development supported; and (iii) institutional capacity, community awareness, and \nknowledge for sustaining climate-change-resilient cities strengthened. \n \n6.  Two subprojects have been approved under the C-TA, and are being implemented \nsatisfactorily: (i) Strengthening Climate Change Resilience in Urban India\u2013Strengthening Smart \nWater Management and Urban Climate Change Resilience in Tamil Nadu (Subproject 1) for $1.55 \nmillion; and (ii) Strengthening Climate Change Resilience in Urban India\u2013Supporting Climate \nChange-Resilient Smart Cities Mission Projects (Subproject 2) for $2.50 million.9 As of 11 October \n2019, out of the total C-TA amount of $7.00 million, $4.05 million (57.86%) has been committed \nwhile $1.84 million (45.43%) has been disbursed.  \n \n7.  For the proposed Subproject 3, Strengthening Smart Urban Mass Rapid Transit and \nClimate Change Resilience in the National Capital Region, the executing agency is the Ministry \nof Housing and Urban Affairs, and the implementing agency is the NCRTC. The subproject will \nhave three distinct outputs in developing solutions for: (i) improved climate change resilience and \nenvironmental sustainability; (ii) urban transport gender mainstreaming and universal accessibility \nstandards in dense urban context of the NCR for safety, affordability and connectivity of the RRTS; \nand (iii) establishing a platform for efficient and sustainable project management using smart \ntechnologies especially building information modelling (BIM). \n                                                \n6  The Urban Climate Change Trust Fund (UCCRTF) aims to scale up investments in urban climate change and disaster \nresilience, especially for the urban poor across eight developing member countries (DMC) of the ADB: Bangladesh, \nIndia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Viet Nam. The Rockefeller Foundation and the \ngovernments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom support the fund. \n7  A minor change memo was approved on 16 December 2015 involving change in executing agency from the Ministry \nof Finance, Department of Economic Affairs to the Ministry of Urban Development.  \n8  The Ministry of Urban Development was renamed to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs through the merger \nwith the Ministry of Urban Employment and Poverty Alleviation in July 2017.  \n9 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n \n ", "3 \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n7.  A climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) was prepared for the ensuing project. \nThe climate change impact to the project is categorized high. The climate of the NCR is an overlap \nbetween  monsoon-influenced  humid  subtropical  and  semi-arid  with  high  variation  between \nsummer and winter temperatures and precipitation. The State Action Plan on Climate Change for \nDelhi projects the temperature to increase by 1.50C\u201320C and rainfall levels to increase by 20% \nwithin the next three decades. Key climate risks for the project are identified to be extreme high \ntemperatures and flooding. These risks have been addressed in the project design through use \nof head-hardened continuous-welded rail, provision of surface coating treatments on concrete \nlining of underground tunnels, raising underground station entrances above surrounding ground \nlevels, and installation of flood gates at all underground stations.10   \n \n8.  In line with this, the subproject is intended to provide targeted assistance for ensuring \nclimate change resilience and universal accessibility through enhanced multimodal integration of \nthe ensuing project. This is suitable for the context of the RRTS which is envisioned to be a new \ntype of urban transport in India. For this purpose, the subproject will review the existing transit-\noriented urban planning approaches of the NCRTC and, where feasible, propose pilot studies for \nselected station areas or towns. It will also support the use of advanced technologies for \ninfrastructure design and construction process management, specifically, BIM and dedicated \nmapping survey technologies. As this is the first time that such technologies will be applied for a \nlarge-scale urban transport project in India, feasibility assessment will be done. Since three RRTS \ncorridors,  including  the  Delhi\u2013Meerut,  are  being  planned  by  the  NCRTC  for  immediate \nimplementation, the subproject has a potentially large demonstration effect for the NCR in terms \nof sharing good practices in innovation in project preparation and management, and enhancing \nclimate chance resilience.  \n \nC.
