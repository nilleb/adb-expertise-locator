During loan negotiations for the Southern Philippines Irrigation Sector Project, 1 the\nGovernment of the Philippines requested Bank assistance in reviewing the application of the\nirrigation service fee (1SF). Subsequently, the February  1999 Country Programming Mission\nconfirmed the Government's request for an advisory technical assistance for the Review of Cost\nRecovery Mechanisms for National Irrigation Systems. In response to this request, in March\n1999, the Bank fielded a TA Fact-Finding Mission to discuss and reach an understanding on the\nobjective, scope, cost estimate, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA\n2 \nwith the Government agencies concerned.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nIL\t BACKGROUND\n2. The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) was established under Republic Act\nNo. 3601 in June 1964 as a Government-owned and controlled corporation mandated to\ndevelop, improve, operate, and maintain irrigation systems throughout the country. Operations\nbegan in March 1964 under the Office of the President, but NIA was transferred to the\nDepartment of Public Works, Transportation, and Communications in September 1972. In July\n1987, NIA was attached to the Department of Public Works and Highways and Department of\nAgriculture (DA). In October 1992, it was transferred wholly to DA, emphasizing MA's role in\nagricultural development and food security.\n3. Under Presidential Decree No. 552 of 1974, NIA is mandated to charge and collect from\nthe beneficiaries of the irrigation systems constructed by or under NIA's administration, such\nfees or administration charges as may be necessary to cover the costs of operation and\nmaintenance (O&M), and to recover the costs of construction within a reasonable period of time\nto the extent consistent with Government policy. However, to date NIA has not collected any fee\nfor the recovery of the cost of construction of the national irrigation systems (NISs).3\n4. Initially NIA operated as a Government agency funded by the national budget. In 1974, a\nmajor change of charter required that NIA become financially independent. NIA was allowed to\nretain revenues from 1SF collections and equipment rentals. By 1979, it had achieved overall\nfinancial viability, a status maintained until the late 1980s. In 1982, under Presidential Decree\nNo. 1702, NIA was authorized to impose an administration and engineering overhead charge of\n5 percent of the total cost of the project. This was to form part of its operating capital. Thus NIA\nwas no longer directly funded by the Government but must secure funds from beneficiaries\nthrough 1SF, and from management fees for new and rehabilitation projects.\n5. Since the early 1990s, NIA has been operating at a loss because of low collection ratio\nof 1SF: it was only 62 percent in 1997 including the backlog account. 4 Despite NIA's efforts to\nimprove O&M standards, 1SF collection has been limited because farmers do not believe that\nLoan 1668-PHI, for $60 million, approved on 18 December 1998\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opponuni(ies in March 1999.\nThe NIS service area covers more than 1000 hectares (ha) per scheme. Located throughout the country,\n178 NISs serve 662,700 ha or 50 percent of the total irrigation service area. Three of the NISs derive irrigation\nsupplies from large multipurpose storage schemes. Magat and Upper Pampanga together serve 200,000 ha of\nirrigation area, as well as generate electricity. Angat-Maasim is primarily an urban water supply scheme, but also\nserves 31,500 ha of irrigation area. The remaining 175 NISs, serving 460000 ha or 69 percent of the service\narea, are mainly run-of-the-river diversion systems. N!A builds, operates, and maintains NISs, and charges users\n1SF to cover the cost of O&M\nIn 1997, the collection ratio was 43 percent of current accounts alone.", "the fees are justified because (i) beneficiaries are not involved in design and implementation;\nand (ii) poor distribution networks at the farm level, resulting in high water losses. Sustainable\nimprovements in irrigation systems will require fundamental changes in the distribution network\nsupported by improved service and greater beneficiary participation in design, implementation,\nand O&M activities.\n6. NIA's financial statements show net losses of 48 percent of total revenues in 1995,\n27 percent in 1996, and 16 percent in 1997. In 1995 and 1996, operating costs exceeded total\nrevenues by P81 million and P19 million, respectively. Only in 1997 were operating costs\ncovered by revenue. The 1997 income was still not adequate however, as O&M costs had to be\ncovered partly by amortized incomes, sale of fixed assets, equipment rental, and subsidies from\nthe national Government.5 The shortfall in O&M funding is therefore presently subsidized from\nthe project development support and management fee. NIA losses necessitated deductions in\nequity, including charges to retained earnings and authorized capital. The Iiquidfty of NIA is\nfurther affected by rapidly growing receivables, which were estimated at P15.7 billion at the end\nof 1997. Doubtful accounts rose from P117 million in 1995 to P163 million in 1997. To achieve\nprofitability, NIA needs to undertake serious cost rationalization. Salary expenses, which make\nup about 60 percent of total expenses, should be reviewed. NIA must increase 1SF collection or\nface bankruptcy.\n7. In 1997 and 1998, the Philippines was affected by a prolonged drought as a\nconsequence of the El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation phenomenon; it was particularly severe in the\nsouthern Philippines. The lack of rainfall during the 1997 southwest monsoon resulted in crop\nproduction losses for wet season rice and corn crops. As a consequence, the area programmed\nfor irrigation by the NlSs was reduced by nearly 8 percent in 1998. Compared with 1997, the\ntotal production of rice and corn in 1998 was reduced by 12.7 percent and 8.7 percent,\nrespectively. In the first six months of 1998, agriculture bore the brunt of the El Ni\u00f1o-induced\ndrought with aggregate output declining 14.6 percent compared with 2.9 percent growth for the\nsame period of 1997.\n8. To mitigate the combined effects of El Ni\u00f1o and the Asian currency crisis on agriculture,\nthe President issued Administrative Order (AO) 17 on 31 August 1998, concerning the so-called\nSocialized 1SF, an urgent interim measure to provide relief to small-scale farmers. It stipulated\nthat (i) farmers owning less than 2 hectares (ha) of irrigated farm land will pay only 50 percent\nof the former 1SF; (ii) farmers owning more than 5 ha of irrigated farm land will pay 50 percent\nmore than the former 1SF; (iii) the minimum amortization payment of 75 kilograms (kg) of paddy\nper year for the communal irrigation system (CIS)6 is reduced to 50 kg/ha per year with no\ninterest. In addition, DA submitted legislative proposals to Congress (i) to increase\nadministrative and overhead charges from 5 percent to 10 percent of the total cost of projects\nundertaken by NIA, and (ii) to negate back accounts of 1SF and CIS amortization. Presently, this\nproposal is under discussion by the Agriculture Committee of Congress.\nIn 1998, the budgeted amount was P206.3 million.\nA CIS has a service area of less than 1000 ha. About 4,925 CISs serve 491,360 ha or 36 percent of the total\nirrigation service area. These are mainly run-of-the-river gravity diversion systems although there are some\npumped schemes. NIA builds ClSs, and transfers these to irrigators' associations (lAs), which are responsible for\nO&M on completion. Farmers are responsible for O&M of the systems and are not charged ISFs but are required\nto contribute to investment costs. Ownership of communal systems is transferred to lAs on completion of the\namortization payment. As stipulated in the Local Government Code of 1991, CISs have been devolved to local\ngovernment units from NIA.", "3\n9. NIA estimates that under the Socialized 1SF scheme, the breakeven point of O&M cost is\nat a collection ratio of 80 percent; this has never been achieved. 7 NIA is required to make an all-\nout effort to collect 1SF to achieve the collection ratio of 80 percent, to be financially\nindependent. Because 69.5 percent of farmers own less than 2 ha and only 8.0 percent own\nmore than 5 ha, NIA estimates that the total 1SF collection will be less than the previous 1SF at\nthe same collection ratio. To compensate for the shortfall, NIA proposes to increase\nmanagement fees from 5 to 10 percent for ongoing and future irrigation projects. However, in\nthe medium term, NIA will turn over O&M of all NIS facilities to irrigators' associations (lAs) 8 to\nreduce its O&M burden for irrigation facilities. As stipulated in the Agriculture Fisheries\nModernization Act of 1997, NIA is mandated to gradually turn over O&M of NIS secondary\ncanals and on-farm facilities to lAs.\n10. To discuss the implications of the Socialized 1SF, a series of consultations were held by\nthe Bank and other funding agencies with DA. After intensive discussions, Government officials\nconcerned confirmed that the Socialized 1SF is a temporary measure that will be reviewed once\nconditions return to normal, and a report will be submitted to the Bank that will include\nrecommendations for revisions of 1SF policies and procedures. The Government further agreed\nthat no later than one year after submission of the review report, it will implement appropriate\nand effective measures to promote full recovery of the O&M cost for each NIS.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n11.\t The TA will assist the Government in reviewing the application of irrigation service fees\nto promote full recovery of O&M costs and a part of the capital investment costs for MS.\nB.\t Scope\n12. The consultant team to be recruited under the TA will conduct a review of existing laws,\nrules and regulations on 1SF, and determine the appropriate level of 1SF considering existing\nand future economic, social, and natural resource conditions of the irrigated areas. This will\ninvolve\n(i) reviewing and assessing the relevant reports, policies, regulations on 1SF, and\nNIA performance;\n(ii) conducting an analysis of N IA's financial viability and assess its corporate plan;\n(iii) conducting a socioeconomic field survey on 1SF in a typical NIS area;\n(iv) examining alternative rate-setting methodologies taking into account the level of\nparticipation of beneficiaries in O&M;\n(v) examining the possibility of establishing O&M funds, including communal\nirrigation systems;\nThe average collection ratio for the past five years is 44 88 percent on the current account basis and\n57.79 percent including the backlog account.\n8 \nUnder section 2 of Presidential Decree 552, dated 1974, an IA is a nonstock and nonprofit legal entity comprising\nthe beneficiaries of a CIS or lateral canal of an NIS. An IA needs to be registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission.", "4\n(vi) recommending the appropriate level of 1SF and beneficiary participation for O&M,\nand the future role of lAs;\n(vii) recommending an appropriate training program for NIA staff and lAs to improve\nthe collection ratio of 1SF; and\n(viii) conducting two workshops on 1SF at the beginning and end of the study.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $430,000 equivalent, of which $184,000 is the\nforeign exchange cost and $246,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government has\nrequested the Bank to finance $300,000 equivalent, consisting of $184,000 to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and $116,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be\nfinanced by the Bank on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA program. The Government will\nfinance the remaining $130,000 equivalent of local currency cost through the provision of\ncounterpart staff, O&M of vehicles, office space, and administrative support. The detailed cost\nestimates and financing plan is shown in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. NIA under DA will be the Executing Agency for the TA, the same agency for the\nSouthern Philippines Irrigation Sector Project (see para. 1). NIA will provide technical and\nengineering counterpart expertise for the implementation of the TA\n15. A steering committee chaired by a high-ranking DA official will be established for the TA.\nThe steering committee will comprise officials from the National Economic and Development\nAuthority (NEDA), Department of Budget and Management, Department of Finance, and DA,\n16. NIA will assign a TA coordinator with the rank of division manager or above to oversee\nthe day-to-day TA activities and to coordinate other agencies such as NEDA, local government\nunits (LGUs), and DA. A full-time sociologist and institutional development specialists will be\nassigned to assist the TA coordinator and serve as counterparts to the consultants.\n17. The TA will be carried out over a six-month period by a team of consultants. The review\nwill require a total of 17 person-months (6 person-months of international consulting, and\n11 person-months of domestic consulting). International expertise will include a team leader and\nirrigation management specialist, while local expertise will include a sociologist, a financial\nanalyst, a legal specialist, and a workshop facilitator. A consulting firm will be contracted by the\nBank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Because the scope\nof the TA is quite straightforward and the methodology is stated clearly in the terms of\nreference, consultant selection under the TA will be on the basis of the Bank's Simplified\nTechnical Proposal procedure. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services are\ngiven in Appendix 3.\n18. One month after the commencement of the TA, the consulting team will conduct a two-\nday workshop outside of Manila, using a participatory approach and gathering about 50 relevant\nstaff from NIA, NEDA, LGUs, and DA; and representatives of lAs, nongovernment organizations\ninvolved in irrigation projects, and farmers, and foreign funding agencies. After summarizing the\nfindings of the workshop, the consultants will submit an inception report that will include the\nproposed methodology and a detailed work schedule. The first tripartite meeting will be held in\nManila one week after the submission of inception report Three and a half months after\ncommencement of the study, an interim report will be submitted; it will contain the necessary", "5\ninformation on socioeconomic, institutional, and physical resources data collected for the study\nand preliminary proposals for the appropriate level of 1SF. The interim report will be discussed at\nthe second tripartite meeting, which will be held one week after submission of the report. A draft\nfinal report will be submitted five and a half months after the commencement of the study.\nThe draft final report will be reviewed in a one-day workshop to be held in Manila and finalized\nat the tripartite meeting in Manila within 10 days of its submission. The final report will\nincorporate the comments made during the meeting and will be submitted after six months of\ncommencement of the TA.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority deleqated by the Board, has epproved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Repub!ic of the\nPhilippines in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 for the purpose of the\nReview of Cost Recovery Mechanisms for National lrriqation Systems, and hereb' reports such\naction to the Board.", "Appendix I\nTechnical Assistance Framework\nDESIGN SUMMARY\t INDICATORS &\t MONITORING\t ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS\n___________________\t TARGETS\t MECHANISMS\t ________________________\nGOAL\n\u2022 Achieve sustainable\t \u2022 All Government subsidies \u2022 Financial statement of NIA\t \u2022 A full cost recovery policy will be\noperation and\t and transfer payments to\t acceptable to the majority of\nmaintenance (O&M) of the\t the National Irrigation\t stakeholders.\nnational irrigation systems\t Administration (NIA) for\n(NISs) without Government O&M are terminated by\nsubsidy.\t 2002.\nAll canals below\t \u2022 Annual report of NIA\t \u2022 Local political pressures and\nsecondary levels and on-\t past ccrrupt practices in collecting\nfarm facilities must be\t fees is prevalent.\ntransferred and managed\t \u2022 Benet]ciaries are adequately\nproperly by the irrigators\t consufted,\nassociatons by 2010.\t \u2022 Historical tendencies to forgive\ndelinquent irrigation service fee\npayments will not predominate to\n______ __________________ __________________________ ___________________________ undermine NIS financial viability.\nPURPOSE\n\u2022 Develop a financially\t \u2022 Scheme is convincingly\t \u2022 Bank's review mission\t \u2022 Stakeholders generally agree\nviable scheme for NlS\t demonstrated/simulated\t \u2022 Bank's postevaluon of\t that the proposed scheme is\nO&M.\t and/or othewise accepted TA\t feasible in tha prevaffing\n_______________\t by2002.\t _______\t Phippinc'.onvfronment.\nOUIPUTS\t \u2022 Technically cornpcct\n\u2022 Review of cost recovery\t \u2022 Study completed by\t \u2022 TA consultant's progress\t intcrnatic'nal and local consultants\nmechanisms for NIS is\t February 2000\t report\t are available when needed.\ncompleted\t \u2022 Banks review mission\nreport\t Sufficient Government\n1.Review of existing laws,\t \u2022 Completed by September \u2022 TA consultant's progress\t counterrart funding, facilities,\nregulations, policies and\t 1009\t report\t transportation, and NA staff\nrelevant reports on\t \u2022 Bank's review mission\t support crc available en a timely\nirrigation systems is\t report\t basis\nconducted.\n2.

During loan negotiations for the Southern Philippines Irrigation Sector Project, 1 the\nGovernment of the Philippines requested Bank assistance in reviewing the application of the\nirrigation service fee (1SF). Subsequently, the February  1999 Country Programming Mission\nconfirmed the Government's request for an advisory technical assistance for the Review of Cost\nRecovery Mechanisms for National Irrigation Systems. In response to this request, in March\n1999, the Bank fielded a TA Fact-Finding Mission to discuss and reach an understanding on the\nobjective, scope, cost estimate, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA\n2 \nwith the Government agencies concerned.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nIL\t BACKGROUND\n2. The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) was established under Republic Act\nNo. 3601 in June 1964 as a Government-owned and controlled corporation mandated to\ndevelop, improve, operate, and maintain irrigation systems throughout the country. Operations\nbegan in March 1964 under the Office of the President, but NIA was transferred to the\nDepartment of Public Works, Transportation, and Communications in September 1972. In July\n1987, NIA was attached to the Department of Public Works and Highways and Department of\nAgriculture (DA). In October 1992, it was transferred wholly to DA, emphasizing MA's role in\nagricultural development and food security.\n3. Under Presidential Decree No. 552 of 1974, NIA is mandated to charge and collect from\nthe beneficiaries of the irrigation systems constructed by or under NIA's administration, such\nfees or administration charges as may be necessary to cover the costs of operation and\nmaintenance (O&M), and to recover the costs of construction within a reasonable period of time\nto the extent consistent with Government policy. However, to date NIA has not collected any fee\nfor the recovery of the cost of construction of the national irrigation systems (NISs).3\n4. Initially NIA operated as a Government agency funded by the national budget. In 1974, a\nmajor change of charter required that NIA become financially independent. NIA was allowed to\nretain revenues from 1SF collections and equipment rentals. By 1979, it had achieved overall\nfinancial viability, a status maintained until the late 1980s. In 1982, under Presidential Decree\nNo. 1702, NIA was authorized to impose an administration and engineering overhead charge of\n5 percent of the total cost of the project. This was to form part of its operating capital. Thus NIA\nwas no longer directly funded by the Government but must secure funds from beneficiaries\nthrough 1SF, and from management fees for new and rehabilitation projects.\n5. Since the early 1990s, NIA has been operating at a loss because of low collection ratio\nof 1SF: it was only 62 percent in 1997 including the backlog account. 4 Despite NIA's efforts to\nimprove O&M standards, 1SF collection has been limited because farmers do not believe that\nLoan 1668-PHI, for $60 million, approved on 18 December 1998\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opponuni(ies in March 1999.\nThe NIS service area covers more than 1000 hectares (ha) per scheme. Located throughout the country,\n178 NISs serve 662,700 ha or 50 percent of the total irrigation service area. Three of the NISs derive irrigation\nsupplies from large multipurpose storage schemes. Magat and Upper Pampanga together serve 200,000 ha of\nirrigation area, as well as generate electricity. Angat-Maasim is primarily an urban water supply scheme, but also\nserves 31,500 ha of irrigation area. The remaining 175 NISs, serving 460000 ha or 69 percent of the service\narea, are mainly run-of-the-river diversion systems. N!A builds, operates, and maintains NISs, and charges users\n1SF to cover the cost of O&M\nIn 1997, the collection ratio was 43 percent of current accounts alone.", "the fees are justified because (i) beneficiaries are not involved in design and implementation;\nand (ii) poor distribution networks at the farm level, resulting in high water losses. Sustainable\nimprovements in irrigation systems will require fundamental changes in the distribution network\nsupported by improved service and greater beneficiary participation in design, implementation,\nand O&M activities.\n6. NIA's financial statements show net losses of 48 percent of total revenues in 1995,\n27 percent in 1996, and 16 percent in 1997. In 1995 and 1996, operating costs exceeded total\nrevenues by P81 million and P19 million, respectively. Only in 1997 were operating costs\ncovered by revenue. The 1997 income was still not adequate however, as O&M costs had to be\ncovered partly by amortized incomes, sale of fixed assets, equipment rental, and subsidies from\nthe national Government.5 The shortfall in O&M funding is therefore presently subsidized from\nthe project development support and management fee. NIA losses necessitated deductions in\nequity, including charges to retained earnings and authorized capital. The Iiquidfty of NIA is\nfurther affected by rapidly growing receivables, which were estimated at P15.7 billion at the end\nof 1997. Doubtful accounts rose from P117 million in 1995 to P163 million in 1997. To achieve\nprofitability, NIA needs to undertake serious cost rationalization. Salary expenses, which make\nup about 60 percent of total expenses, should be reviewed. NIA must increase 1SF collection or\nface bankruptcy.\n7. In 1997 and 1998, the Philippines was affected by a prolonged drought as a\nconsequence of the El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation phenomenon; it was particularly severe in the\nsouthern Philippines. The lack of rainfall during the 1997 southwest monsoon resulted in crop\nproduction losses for wet season rice and corn crops. As a consequence, the area programmed\nfor irrigation by the NlSs was reduced by nearly 8 percent in 1998. Compared with 1997, the\ntotal production of rice and corn in 1998 was reduced by 12.7 percent and 8.7 percent,\nrespectively. In the first six months of 1998, agriculture bore the brunt of the El Ni\u00f1o-induced\ndrought with aggregate output declining 14.6 percent compared with 2.9 percent growth for the\nsame period of 1997.\n8. To mitigate the combined effects of El Ni\u00f1o and the Asian currency crisis on agriculture,\nthe President issued Administrative Order (AO) 17 on 31 August 1998, concerning the so-called\nSocialized 1SF, an urgent interim measure to provide relief to small-scale farmers. It stipulated\nthat (i) farmers owning less than 2 hectares (ha) of irrigated farm land will pay only 50 percent\nof the former 1SF; (ii) farmers owning more than 5 ha of irrigated farm land will pay 50 percent\nmore than the former 1SF; (iii) the minimum amortization payment of 75 kilograms (kg) of paddy\nper year for the communal irrigation system (CIS)6 is reduced to 50 kg/ha per year with no\ninterest. In addition, DA submitted legislative proposals to Congress (i) to increase\nadministrative and overhead charges from 5 percent to 10 percent of the total cost of projects\nundertaken by NIA, and (ii) to negate back accounts of 1SF and CIS amortization. Presently, this\nproposal is under discussion by the Agriculture Committee of Congress.\nIn 1998, the budgeted amount was P206.3 million.\nA CIS has a service area of less than 1000 ha. About 4,925 CISs serve 491,360 ha or 36 percent of the total\nirrigation service area. These are mainly run-of-the-river gravity diversion systems although there are some\npumped schemes. NIA builds ClSs, and transfers these to irrigators' associations (lAs), which are responsible for\nO&M on completion. Farmers are responsible for O&M of the systems and are not charged ISFs but are required\nto contribute to investment costs. Ownership of communal systems is transferred to lAs on completion of the\namortization payment. As stipulated in the Local Government Code of 1991, CISs have been devolved to local\ngovernment units from NIA.", "3\n9. NIA estimates that under the Socialized 1SF scheme, the breakeven point of O&M cost is\nat a collection ratio of 80 percent; this has never been achieved. 7 NIA is required to make an all-\nout effort to collect 1SF to achieve the collection ratio of 80 percent, to be financially\nindependent. Because 69.5 percent of farmers own less than 2 ha and only 8.0 percent own\nmore than 5 ha, NIA estimates that the total 1SF collection will be less than the previous 1SF at\nthe same collection ratio. To compensate for the shortfall, NIA proposes to increase\nmanagement fees from 5 to 10 percent for ongoing and future irrigation projects. However, in\nthe medium term, NIA will turn over O&M of all NIS facilities to irrigators' associations (lAs) 8 to\nreduce its O&M burden for irrigation facilities. As stipulated in the Agriculture Fisheries\nModernization Act of 1997, NIA is mandated to gradually turn over O&M of NIS secondary\ncanals and on-farm facilities to lAs.\n10. To discuss the implications of the Socialized 1SF, a series of consultations were held by\nthe Bank and other funding agencies with DA. After intensive discussions, Government officials\nconcerned confirmed that the Socialized 1SF is a temporary measure that will be reviewed once\nconditions return to normal, and a report will be submitted to the Bank that will include\nrecommendations for revisions of 1SF policies and procedures. The Government further agreed\nthat no later than one year after submission of the review report, it will implement appropriate\nand effective measures to promote full recovery of the O&M cost for each NIS.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n11.\t The TA will assist the Government in reviewing the application of irrigation service fees\nto promote full recovery of O&M costs and a part of the capital investment costs for MS.\nB.\t Scope\n12. The consultant team to be recruited under the TA will conduct a review of existing laws,\nrules and regulations on 1SF, and determine the appropriate level of 1SF considering existing\nand future economic, social, and natural resource conditions of the irrigated areas. This will\ninvolve\n(i) reviewing and assessing the relevant reports, policies, regulations on 1SF, and\nNIA performance;\n(ii) conducting an analysis of N IA's financial viability and assess its corporate plan;\n(iii) conducting a socioeconomic field survey on 1SF in a typical NIS area;\n(iv) examining alternative rate-setting methodologies taking into account the level of\nparticipation of beneficiaries in O&M;\n(v) examining the possibility of establishing O&M funds, including communal\nirrigation systems;\nThe average collection ratio for the past five years is 44 88 percent on the current account basis and\n57.79 percent including the backlog account.\n8 \nUnder section 2 of Presidential Decree 552, dated 1974, an IA is a nonstock and nonprofit legal entity comprising\nthe beneficiaries of a CIS or lateral canal of an NIS. An IA needs to be registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission.", "4\n(vi) recommending the appropriate level of 1SF and beneficiary participation for O&M,\nand the future role of lAs;\n(vii) recommending an appropriate training program for NIA staff and lAs to improve\nthe collection ratio of 1SF; and\n(viii) conducting two workshops on 1SF at the beginning and end of the study.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $430,000 equivalent, of which $184,000 is the\nforeign exchange cost and $246,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government has\nrequested the Bank to finance $300,000 equivalent, consisting of $184,000 to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and $116,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be\nfinanced by the Bank on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA program. The Government will\nfinance the remaining $130,000 equivalent of local currency cost through the provision of\ncounterpart staff, O&M of vehicles, office space, and administrative support. The detailed cost\nestimates and financing plan is shown in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. NIA under DA will be the Executing Agency for the TA, the same agency for the\nSouthern Philippines Irrigation Sector Project (see para. 1). NIA will provide technical and\nengineering counterpart expertise for the implementation of the TA\n15. A steering committee chaired by a high-ranking DA official will be established for the TA.\nThe steering committee will comprise officials from the National Economic and Development\nAuthority (NEDA), Department of Budget and Management, Department of Finance, and DA,\n16. NIA will assign a TA coordinator with the rank of division manager or above to oversee\nthe day-to-day TA activities and to coordinate other agencies such as NEDA, local government\nunits (LGUs), and DA. A full-time sociologist and institutional development specialists will be\nassigned to assist the TA coordinator and serve as counterparts to the consultants.\n17. The TA will be carried out over a six-month period by a team of consultants. The review\nwill require a total of 17 person-months (6 person-months of international consulting, and\n11 person-months of domestic consulting). International expertise will include a team leader and\nirrigation management specialist, while local expertise will include a sociologist, a financial\nanalyst, a legal specialist, and a workshop facilitator. A consulting firm will be contracted by the\nBank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Because the scope\nof the TA is quite straightforward and the methodology is stated clearly in the terms of\nreference, consultant selection under the TA will be on the basis of the Bank's Simplified\nTechnical Proposal procedure. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services are\ngiven in Appendix 3.\n18. One month after the commencement of the TA, the consulting team will conduct a two-\nday workshop outside of Manila, using a participatory approach and gathering about 50 relevant\nstaff from NIA, NEDA, LGUs, and DA; and representatives of lAs, nongovernment organizations\ninvolved in irrigation projects, and farmers, and foreign funding agencies. After summarizing the\nfindings of the workshop, the consultants will submit an inception report that will include the\nproposed methodology and a detailed work schedule. The first tripartite meeting will be held in\nManila one week after the submission of inception report Three and a half months after\ncommencement of the study, an interim report will be submitted; it will contain the necessary", "5\ninformation on socioeconomic, institutional, and physical resources data collected for the study\nand preliminary proposals for the appropriate level of 1SF. The interim report will be discussed at\nthe second tripartite meeting, which will be held one week after submission of the report. A draft\nfinal report will be submitted five and a half months after the commencement of the study.\nThe draft final report will be reviewed in a one-day workshop to be held in Manila and finalized\nat the tripartite meeting in Manila within 10 days of its submission. The final report will\nincorporate the comments made during the meeting and will be submitted after six months of\ncommencement of the TA.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority deleqated by the Board, has epproved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Repub!ic of the\nPhilippines in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 for the purpose of the\nReview of Cost Recovery Mechanisms for National lrriqation Systems, and hereb' reports such\naction to the Board.", "Appendix I\nTechnical Assistance Framework\nDESIGN SUMMARY\t INDICATORS &\t MONITORING\t ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS\n___________________\t TARGETS\t MECHANISMS\t ________________________\nGOAL\n\u2022 Achieve sustainable\t \u2022 All Government subsidies \u2022 Financial statement of NIA\t \u2022 A full cost recovery policy will be\noperation and\t and transfer payments to\t acceptable to the majority of\nmaintenance (O&M) of the\t the National Irrigation\t stakeholders.\nnational irrigation systems\t Administration (NIA) for\n(NISs) without Government O&M are terminated by\nsubsidy.\t 2002.\nAll canals below\t \u2022 Annual report of NIA\t \u2022 Local political pressures and\nsecondary levels and on-\t past ccrrupt practices in collecting\nfarm facilities must be\t fees is prevalent.\ntransferred and managed\t \u2022 Benet]ciaries are adequately\nproperly by the irrigators\t consufted,\nassociatons by 2010.\t \u2022 Historical tendencies to forgive\ndelinquent irrigation service fee\npayments will not predominate to\n______ __________________ __________________________ ___________________________ undermine NIS financial viability.\nPURPOSE\n\u2022 Develop a financially\t \u2022 Scheme is convincingly\t \u2022 Bank's review mission\t \u2022 Stakeholders generally agree\nviable scheme for NlS\t demonstrated/simulated\t \u2022 Bank's postevaluon of\t that the proposed scheme is\nO&M.\t and/or othewise accepted TA\t feasible in tha prevaffing\n_______________\t by2002.\t _______\t Phippinc'.onvfronment.\nOUIPUTS\t \u2022 Technically cornpcct\n\u2022 Review of cost recovery\t \u2022 Study completed by\t \u2022 TA consultant's progress\t intcrnatic'nal and local consultants\nmechanisms for NIS is\t February 2000\t report\t are available when needed.\ncompleted\t \u2022 Banks review mission\nreport\t Sufficient Government\n1.Review of existing laws,\t \u2022 Completed by September \u2022 TA consultant's progress\t counterrart funding, facilities,\nregulations, policies and\t 1009\t report\t transportation, and NA staff\nrelevant reports on\t \u2022 Bank's review mission\t support crc available en a timely\nirrigation systems is\t report\t basis\nconducted.\n2.
