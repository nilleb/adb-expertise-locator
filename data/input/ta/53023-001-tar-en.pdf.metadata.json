INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  provide  research-based \nsolutions in the health sector to support inclusive growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nIt will (i) address institutional challenges, and (ii) promote digital technology and eventually \ngenerate regional public goods. The TA will reduce the rural\u2013urban disparity in health service \ndelivery, and support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (to ensure healthy \nlives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and attainment of universal health coverage. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021 of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).1 It is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, \n2016\u20132020 and Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) is committed to the \nPRC\u2019s national rural revitalization strategy as it aims to reinvigorate rural areas to reduce poverty, \npromote equity, improve rural development, and support green and inclusive growth. Improving \naccess to health services is critical to achieving this goal, particularly in rural areas. \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s health sector has undergone a series of reforms since 2009. These included \nshifting resources to primary health care (PHC), which has supported the PRC\u2019s high level of \nhealth  coverage  and  the  New  Rural  Cooperative  Medical  Scheme,  which  has  become  a \nnationwide comprehensive insurance scheme providing outpatient benefits that target the rural \npopulation.3 The Healthy China 2030 plan\u2014a national strategy approved by the State Council\u2014\nfurther guides all provinces and regions, including GZAR, to prioritize improvement of rural PHC \nquality, through the use of innovations and health system efficiencies, to reduce the burden on \nhospitals and secondary health facilities.4 However, there is still a significant gap across the PRC \nin terms of health care service quality between urban and rural areas. The quality of clinical \nprocesses is often left to the discretion of providers, while the quality of health care services is \nhighly dependent on provider capacity.5 Providers in urban areas typically have more resources \nand capacity than those in rural areas. GZAR has a rural population of 3 million people in 54 poor \ncounties,  and  faces  considerable  challenges  in  improving  rural  health  care  quality,  and  in \nimplementing Healthy GZAR 2030.6 \n \n1  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2019\u20132021. Manila. The initial TA title \nwas Study on Health Sector but was adjusted to better reflect the scope of the TA. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2019. \n2  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: People's Republic of China, 2016\u20132020\u2014Transforming Partnership: \nPeople's Republic of China and Asian Development Bank. Manila; and ADB. 2015. Health in Asia and the Pacific: \nOperational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020. Manila. \n3  World Health Organization. 2018. Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals Country Profile \n2018\u2014China. Geneva. The PRC\u2019s progress towards universal health coverage is as follows: a universal health \ncoverage index of 76 out of 100 for coverage of essential services, and 4.8% with respect to financial risk protection \n(the proportion of population with out-of-pocket health spending exceeding 25% of the household's budget or \nincome). However, there are gaps in financial risk protection by place of residence and economic status in the PRC. \n4  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2016. The Healthy China 2030. Beijing. \n5  For example, in the PRC, 45% of assistant physicians working in large city hospitals have bachelor\u2019s degrees or \nhigher education levels, while at the community level, about 75% of doctors at township and community health \ncenters have only vocational high school or 2-year college medical degrees. Most village doctors are former \u201cbarefoot \ndoctors\u201d who only have a vocational high school medical education. \n6  GZAR. 2017. Advancing Healthy Guangxi Development 2030. Nanning. \n \n ", "2 \n5. In addition to gaps in quality between urban and rural health services, GZAR also faces\nhealth risks stemming from the significant volume of cross border trade with and migration from\nViet Nam.7 Controlling outbreaks and cross border health threats can be a major challenge; in\nGZAR, animal trade and human migration have the potential to spread communicable diseases\nacross borders. PHC service providers are the first point of contact for early disease detection,\ntreatment, and surveillance. Ensuring high-quality PHC services, especially in rural border areas,\ncan control potential epidemics and protect the health of the population, including vulnerable\ngroups such as internal and cross border migrants. PHC facilities should be strengthened,\nparticularly in rural underserved areas,  by improving the quality and capacity of the facilities, as\nthese are the closest diagnostic facilities on the ground and serve as important surveillance points.\n6. GZAR provides free basic public health services to migrants, focusing mainly on maternal\nand child health and family planning services. Services include immunization, prenatal and\npostnatal checkups for pregnant women, prevention and control of communicable diseases, and\nfamily planning and health education. While basic health care needs are covered, services related\nto  noncommunicable  diseases  (NCDs)  and  other  clinical  services,  occupational  health,\nrehabilitation, and palliative care (i.e., inpatient and outpatient services) are not covered for\nmigrants. Such services should be extended to migrants to reduce inequality and improve the\noverall health of the migrant population.\n7. In addition, GZAR is facing the PRC\u2019s broader national challenge of a rapidly aging elderly\npopulation. Longer life expectancies are increasing the susceptibility of the elderly to costly\nprolonged medical issues, particularly NCDs. NCD cases among Chinese people above the age\nof 40 are predicted to triple over the next 2 decades, while 35% of the PRC\u2019s population will be\nabove 60 years of age by 2050.8 Increasing health care services for major NCDs (asthma, cancer,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke) require\nintegration of primary care settings using innovative and cost-effective interventions. ADB has\nincreasingly  strengthened  its  intervention  for  elderly  care  in  GZAR  since  2015.9 A  project\napproved in September 2019 aims to help GZAR develop a proper integrated health referral\nsystem between medical institutions such as hospitals and elderly care institutions, and improve\nthe quality and quantity of elderly care institutions to provide a range of care needs.10 This effort\nmust be expanded to rural primary health service providers, as they are the first level health care\nproviders in the rural areas.\n8. Although the government has actively promoted the use of digital technology to improve\nhealth service delivery and management following the Healthy China 2030 plan, an urban\u2013rural\ngap remains in terms of the actual use of digital technology in urban and rural health systems.\nLarge hospitals in urban areas are using digital technology to efficiently deliver services and\nmanage  overcrowding  by  queuing  patients  through  online  appointment  systems,  electronic\nnotification of examination results, digital payment systems, and electronic medical records\nsystems. Nevertheless, the use of digital technology in rural health facilities is lagging behind.\n7  GZAR is one of 10 provinces in the PRC with a rural poverty rate above 7% and one of six provinces with over \n3 million rural poor (as of 2016). This is partly due to low soil fertility associated with karst topography (limestone \nlandscapes with sinkholes, underground streams, and caverns) and low levels of infrastructure and connectivity to \nother regions. \n8  Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.

", "3 \nOnline systems to improve family doctor services and remote diagnosis have been designed, but \nare not fully functional, as rural PHC providers use the system only to settle health insurance \nclaims. \n9. To respond to current gaps in rural health service delivery including the weak adoption of\ndigital technology, rapidly changing needs of the vulnerable rural population, and increasing\nhealth risks related to cross border trade and migration; assessments of GZAR\u2019s rural health\nsystem will be conducted. The TA outputs will help determine interventions that would strengthen\nGZAR\u2019s rural health system.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n10. The TA is aligned with the following impact: rural health system in GZAR strengthened\n(footnote 6). The TA will have the following outcome: GZAR\u2019s rural primary health system planning\nand management improved.11\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n11. Output 1: Health services in rural areas assessed. Output 1 will support an assessment\nof the rural PHC system, including a review of its capacity, institutional mechanisms, and quality\nof services. Current practices of rural PHC providers to support NCD patients, particularly the\nelderly and migrants, will be analyzed. The output will also assess the current system, actions of\nPHC providers in terms of pandemic response, incentive mechanism of health workers in rural\nareas, and quality of services provided to migrants. The TA will support an in-depth assessment\nof quality improvement mechanisms that considers the circumstances of male and female patients,\nespecially in terms of service delivery by rural PHC facilities.\n12. Output 2: Application of digital technology for health care services assessed.\nOutput 2 will assess the use of digital technology to improve access to and the quality of PHC\nservices in areas where these services are weak. Online platforms that aggregate a database of\nphysicians from specialty hospitals in GZAR will be explored and assessed. A proposal for an\nimproved mechanism using digital technology and telemedicine for diagnostic and consultative\nsupport to rural doctors will be developed. The output will assess the use of digital technology to\nimprove the system and institutional mechanisms that can support better service quality for males,\nfemales, and the elderly.\n13. Output 3: Knowledge on improved rural primary health care expanded. Output 3 will\nbe a knowledge product on rural PHC in GZAR that will build on the work done under outputs 1\nand 2. The knowledge product should include a thorough situational analysis of current rural PHC\nservices in GZAR, including any gaps, and propose methods to improve the overall health system.\nThe  knowledge  product  should  be  a  substantial  document  that  will  be  published following\nagreement between the government and ADB. A TA final workshop which will launch the\nknowledge product will be held to discuss and disseminate TA findings and recommendations\nwith officials from GZAR and at least three other selected provinces.\n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "4 \nC. Cost and Financing\n14. The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis\nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items\nare listed in Appendix 2.\n15. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation,\ncommunication facilities for consultants, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n16. ADB will administer the TA, which is to be implemented from December 2019 to March\n2021. The executing agency will be the GZAR Health Commission. A TA steering committee will\nbe formed and will be led by the GZAR Project Management Office in Guangxi Development and\nReform Commission; and members will include the GZAR departments of finance, agriculture and\nrural affairs, and the GZAR Health Commission.\n17.
