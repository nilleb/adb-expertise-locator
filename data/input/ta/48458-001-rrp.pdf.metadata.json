THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Expanding Private Participation in Infrastructure Program, and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe Expanding Private Participation in Infrastructure Program.1 \n \n2.  The program will assist the government in meeting its targeted infrastructure investment \nrate, including public and private spending. This will be achieved by supporting sequenced \nreforms aimed at stepping up private investment in infrastructure through the promotion of \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects. In close alignment with the Philippine Development \nPlan (PDP), 2011\u20132016, the program supports initiatives aimed at (i) strengthening government \nfinancial  support  to  PPPs,  (ii)  expanding  and  efficiently  implementing  the  pipeline  of  PPP \nprojects, and (iii) strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development problem and opportunities. As a result of years of underinvestment, the \navailability and quality of infrastructure remains poor in the Philippines compared with most of its \nregional neighbors. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report 2014\u20132015 \nranks the  Philippines  95th  out  of 144  countries  on the quality  of  its overall  infrastructure. \nAlthough a slight improvement from the 2013\u20132014 ranking (98th) did occur, the Philippines still \nranks behind Singapore (5th), Malaysia (20th), the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (66th), \nIndonesia (72nd), and Thailand (76th). This situation is the result of low public infrastructure \ninvestment (an annual 2.0% of gross domestic product [GDP] in 2008\u20132012) and insignificant \nprivate participation in infrastructure (investment commitments under PPP contracts totaled on \naverage just 1.0% of GDP in 1998\u20132012). The country\u2019s annual infrastructure investment needs \nare  estimated  at  6.0%  of  GDP  (by  sector:  2.3%  in  transport,  1.9%  in  energy,  1.2%  in \ntelecommunications, and 0.7% in water and sanitation).2 \n \n4.  The inadequate supply of quality infrastructure has impacted the economy in several \nways. First, insufficient investments in infrastructure have become the major constraint to doing \nbusiness in the Philippines and a drag on achieving higher, sustainable economic growth. \nSecond,  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  has  resulted  in  significant  economic  losses.  For \ninstance, the forgone income due to road congestion in Metro Manila is estimated at 8% of \nGDP.3 Third, the government has lacked the capacity to harness the potential efficiency gains of \nprivate  participation.  Private  participation  in  infrastructure  tends  to  result  in  projects  being \ndelivered on time and on budget. Several studies for the United Kingdom reported that average \nPPP savings against traditional infrastructure projects range between 5.0% and 40.0%. The \nNational Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) found that development projects in the \nPhilippines, including many infrastructure projects, were beset with delays and cost overruns. \nFourth, poor quality infrastructure has an important impact on poverty incidence (24.9% in 2014, \nnational poverty line) and income inequality in the Philippines, as well-developed infrastructure \nnetwork grants less-developed communities access to economic activities and services. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  B. Bhattacharyay. 2010. Estimating Demand for Infrastructure in Energy, Transport, Telecommunications, Water \nand Sanitation in Asia and the Pacific: 2010\u20132020. ADBI Working Paper No. 248. Tokyo. \n3  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2014. Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure Development for Metro \nManila and Its Surrounding Areas. Tokyo. ", "2 \n5.  The deepening of fiscal reforms4 since 2010 has enabled the government to increase \npublic infrastructure spending to 3.5% of GDP in 2014, reflecting the government\u2019s commitment \nto meet the PDP 2011\u20132016 target of public infrastructure investments of 5.0% of GDP by \n2016.5 Recognizing the private sector\u2019s large untapped potential in infrastructure provision, and \nthe potential cost savings from PPP projects, the government successfully initiated reforms to \nrevive the national PPP program. These efforts have resulted in the award of nine PPP projects \n(total investment of $3 billion) by 2015, up from six PPP projects awarded between 1992 and \n2010. Signed projects include the SLEX Link Road Project; the PPP for School Infrastructure \nProject, phases 1 and 2; the NAIA Expressway, phase 2; the modernization of the Philippine \nOrthopedic Center; and the Mactan\u2013Cebu International Airport Passenger Terminal Building. \nThe project pipeline increased from 11 projects ($3.3 billion) in November 2010 to 45 projects \n($23.2 billion) in March 2015. Such a robust PPP rollout supports the government\u2019s intention to \nraise private investment in infrastructure from 0.4% of GDP in 2013 to 1.1% of GDP in 2015, \nwhich would help attain the PDP\u2019s objective of a 22% ratio of investment to GDP by 2016. \n \n6.  Binding  constraints. In 2010\u20132012, the government tackled the first set of issues \nconstraining the revival of the national PPP program, such as the absence of a public office for \nPPP program facilitation, the lack of a project development and monitoring facility (PDMF) to \nprepare PPP transactions, the lack of a credible project pipeline, and inadequate implementing \nrules and regulations of the build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (BOT) law.6 To sustain these efforts, the \ngovernment has recognized the next set of hurdles it needs to clear (paras. 7\u201311).  \n \n7.  Inadequate  financing  for  government\u2019s  share  in  Public-Private  Partnership \nprojects. Three main financial and fiscal risks need to be managed to encourage private \nparticipation. First, PPP implementing agencies must improve their systems of assessing and \nbudgeting for right-of-way acquisition and resettlement (in the absence of which project costs \nmay  escalate  and  implementation  timeframes  are  challenged).  Second,  strengthened \nmanagement systems for, and funding of, PPP contingent liabilities (derived for instance on \nearly contract termination, or debt guarantees) will help minimize the government\u2019s exposure to \nfiscal costs (if properly identified, assessed and dealt with). Addressing efficient contingent \nliabilities can also improve the attractiveness of PPP projects for private investors, as it reduces \nproject  associated  risks  and  uncertainty.  Third,  viability  gap  funding  (VGF),  the  \nnon-remunerated grant made by the government to a PPP project, needs to be institutionalized \nso that the project can charge affordable tariffs to the public while producing a competitive \nfinancial return for the investor. \n \n8.   Untapped capital market and lack of access to international commercial bank \nfinancing. The long duration of PPP projects and their varied risk\u2013return characteristics, as well \nas  their  complex  structures,  require  facilitation  of  long-term  funding  by  capital  markets. \nInfrastructure projects generating a robust revenue stream provide an opportunity for project \nbond  structuring  and,  with  the  appropriate  rating,  represent  an  attractive  asset  class  for \ninstitutional investors, i.e., the pension funds and life insurance companies managing long-term \nasset\u2013liability portfolios. \n \n                                                \n4  On the revenue side, important reforms included the implementation of the Sin Tax, and efforts on enhancing the \nefficiency of tax administration and combating evasion, leading to improved tax collection.  \n5  Government of the Philippines. 2014. Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016: Midterm Update. With Revalidated \nResults Matrices. Manila. \n6  Republic Act 6957, dated 9 July 1990 (as amended by Republic Act 7718, dated 8 May 1994), sets a uniform \nframework for undertaking PPPs to be followed in all sectors and by all levels of government. ", "3 \n9.  Lack of infrastructure master plans. The country\u2019s transport infrastructure woes are \nrooted in a lack of long-term planning. While sector master plans exist, integrated infrastructure \nmaster plans for regions or regional infrastructure development plans are not in place. The \nsector plans themselves are marked by insufficient integration of land-use planning and physical \nframework plans across administrative jurisdictions, which may be regarded as the root causes \nof the infrastructure deficit. Expanding the PPP project pipeline will require the adoption of \nintegrated transport master plans for the nation and the main metropolitan regions to guide \nsector investment plans. That will allow investors to plan over the long term. \n \n10.  Fledgling institutional framework. To develop the PPP pipeline, it is also essential to \nstrengthen core PPP institutions and implementing agencies. Core institutions include the PPP \nGoverning Board as the overall policy-making body, the PPP Center, the PDMF as the revolving \nfund for PPP project preparation, and the international transaction advisory panel for PPP units. \nAll of these need to be effectively set up, staffed, and budgeted to implement the PPP program. \nIn  the  Philippines,  some  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of  Transportation  and \nCommunications (DOTC) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) have \nfunctioning PPP units, but these still need strengthening to fulfill their roles effectively. Finally, \nexpanding the PPP pipeline will require rolling out reforms to selected local government units \n(LGUs) in a sequenced manner.  \n \n11.  Incomplete legal and regulatory framework. The current BOT law offers a narrow \nregulatory framework for PPPs. It has been expanded in a number of reforms but needs to be \ninstitutionalized. Various amendments to the BOT law are required, such as (i) clearly defining \ntax incentives for PPP projects of national significance, (ii) streamlining PPP project approvals \nwithin the government, (iii) strengthening the PPP institutions, or (iv) institutionalizing the PDMF \ntransaction advisory mechanism. In addition, alternative tools are needed to resolve disputes, \nsuch as those arising from a contract. Making their resolution less expensive, tedious, complex, \nand time-consuming will create a climate more conducive to private investments. \n \n12.  Government  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  boost  public \ninfrastructure investments to 5.0% of GDP by 2016 and to increase private participation in \ninfrastructure to 1.1% of GDP  by institutionalizing the PPP program. The government has \nsuccessfully implemented reforms to revive the PPP program: it (i) restructured the former BOT \nCenter at the Department of Trade and Industry into an empowered PPP Center; (ii) amended \nthe implementing rules and regulations of the BOT law; (iii) established the PPP Governing \nBoard as its central PPP policy-making body; and (iv) set up the PDMF to support implementing \nagencies in the conduct of pre-investment studies, and project monitoring. Going forward, the \ngovernment has sketched out reforms to (i) strengthen public financial support for PPP projects, \n(ii) expand the project pipeline through continued institutional development; and (iii) complete \nthe unfinished legal and regulatory reforms required to lock in an efficient PPP program. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  past  interventions.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  long  been \nsupporting PPPs through sector projects, technical assistance (TA) projects, and PBLs in public \nsector management. Since 2011, ADB has provided comprehensive dedicated support to PPPs \nthrough (i) the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program, 2011\u20132014,7 which \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

Lessons learned and ADB value added to reform design and implementation. A \nkey lesson from prior ADB support to PPP reforms is the need to take a \u201cone-ADB approach\u201d in \nsupport of the government\u2019s infrastructure reforms. This includes support to a medium-term \npolicy reform framework, sustained capacity development TA,10 and project-specific support. A \nsecond  lesson  learned  is  the  need  to  combine  support  to  regulatory  and  institutional \ndevelopment with project pipeline development. As a result of progress in these two areas, the \nmain focus of ADB support is now shifting to project implementation aspects. The program \nemphasizes the need to build capacities for project preparation and implementation at national \nand local  agencies through the PPP Center. Third, ADB support also underlined the need to \nwork  in  parallel  on  the  development  of  capital  markets  to  allow  for  more  opportunities  to \nleverage financial resources from a variety of stakeholders (bank and nonbank sectors) for PPP \nprojects. The program is therefore complemented by ADB\u2019s Encouraging Investment through \nCapital Market Reforms Program, processed in parallel. Through the implementation of recent \nTA projects, ADB has been instrumental in assisting the government in various reforms, such as \n(i) setting up a panel of transaction advisors under the PDMF11 (the panel now represents \n22 international consortia); (ii) strengthening the reorganized PPP Center and boosting the PPP \nenabling environment through advice on draft amendments to the BOT law and its implementing \nrules and regulations, and appraisal and approval arrangements; and (iii) strengthening the \ncapacity of NEDA for PPP project appraisals, and the capacity of the Department of Finance \n(DOF) for the management of contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects. The program is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the Philippines.12 \n \n15.  Donor  coordination.13  Close  cooperation  exists  with  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, the program\u2019s cofinancier with $200 million and a leading government \ndevelopment partner in building the capacities of PPP project implementing agencies and in \ndrafting infrastructure road maps. In addition, ADB has forged a strong partnership for PPP \nreforms  with  the  governments  of  Australia  and  Canada;  both  have  provided  significant \ncofinancing  to  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA  for  Strengthening  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  in  the \nPhilippines, focusing on the development of the institutional framework for PPP identification \nand implementation. Coordination with other major development partners (e.g., International \nFinance  Corporation,  World  Bank)  is  articulated  through  the  platform  of  semiannual \ndevelopment  partner  meetings  during  the  joint  ADB\u2013Australia\u2013Canada  review  missions  for \nADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships in the Philippines. The World Bank is \nproviding capacity building to the PPP Center, while the International Finance Corporation has \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

Policy-based  loan  and  budget  support.  The  program,  building  on  the \naccomplishments and post-program partnership framework of the Increasing Competitiveness \nfor Inclusive Growth Program, will be ADB\u2019s first policy-based operation in the Philippines to be \nfully focused on PPP reforms. The programmatic approach and PBL modality was selected \nbecause it will help leverage government and stakeholder support for locking complex policy \nobjectives into implementable policy reforms and budget allocations over the medium-term. \nCombined with substantial TA, it supports capacity building of relevant agencies. The program \nwill  have  two  subprograms  as  part  of  a  medium-term  PPP  reform.  The  program\u2019s  reform \napproach is to first support the government with a robust framework for its financial support to \nPPP projects. The program then introduces measures to expand the pipeline of PPP projects by \nfurther enhancing the PPP institutional setup, capacity development, and planning process. The \nprogram also includes measures to complete the legal and regulatory framework to lock in the \nPPP program. \n \n17.  Economic impact. The three outputs of the program combined are expected to achieve \nthe award of at least 15 national PPP projects during the program period and at least five local \nPPP projects prepared with PDMF support, in addition to an overall expanded pipeline of \nprojects. The economic gains from this are expected to be achieved through (i) efficiency gains \n(in terms of project costs within budget and timely completion) associated with PPP projects, \nand  (ii)  an  increase  in  the  overall  level  of  infrastructure  investments  that  would  not  have \noccurred without the PPP program (para. 32). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The  impact  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  target  of  increased  investment  in \ninfrastructure. The outcome will be improved private participation in infrastructure. The PBL is \nstructured around three major outputs covering all key areas of reform, and drawn from the \ngovernment\u2019s reform priorities. Subprogram 1 includes 16 policy actions (seven triggers and \nnine  milestones)  completed  between  June  2013  and  June  2015.  Subprogram  2  includes  \n10 triggers. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n19.  Strengthened government financial support to PPPs. To manage the three main \nfinancial  and  fiscal  risks,  this  output  will  support  reforms  to  ensure  adequate  and  fiscally \nsustainable  financing  of  the  government\u2019s  share  in  PPP  projects.  For  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment has allocated funds, under the General Appropriations Act, 2015 to cover the \nshares of the DPWH and the DOTC in the cost of right-of-way acquisition and resettlement in \nPPP projects. A contingent liabilities fund has been established to enable the government to \nmeet its contractual obligations on PPPs. Funding has also been made available under the \nGeneral Appropriations Act to ensure that the DOTC develops adequate access roads to major \nairports and roll-on, roll-off (RORO) facilities. \n \n20.  The  government  has  institutionalized  the  VGF  scheme  to  improve  the  commercial \nattractiveness of economically viable, solicited user-pay projects. For eligible projects, cash \nsubsidies will be provided to the concessionaires as part of the government\u2019s contribution to the \nPPP project. This will facilitate the implementation of infrastructure projects with high economic \nbenefits but an unattractive commercial rate of return at user pricing that is affordable to the \n ", "6 \npublic.  In  addition,  the  government  has  made  available  adequate  funding  for  contingent \nliabilities arising from PPP contracts. To ensure the fiscal sustainability of the PPP portfolio, the \ngovernment has established an interagency working group to monitor contingent liabilities of \npipeline  and  ongoing  PPP  projects,  and  DOF\u2019s  Bureau  of  Treasury  has  developed  a \nmethodology for valuing PPP projects\u2019 contingent liabilities. This is expected to enhance overall \ninvestor confidence, the country credit rating, and responses to PPP projects. \n \n21.  For subprogram 2, the government will continue to ensure the fiscal sustainability of \nbudget funding for direct and contingent public support to PPP projects, including right-of-way, \nresettlement,  and  VGF  for  DOTC  and  DPWH  projects.  The  government  will  also  allocate \nadequate funding to cover contingent liabilities arising from PPP contracts that may materialize \nin  2016  and  2017. The government, through  the  Bureau  of the Treasury,  will  continue  to \nimprove the framework for funding contingent liabilities. Proposals will be prepared to define \nfiscal  rules  related  to  PPPs  and  for  the  incorporation  of  PPPs  into  debt-sustainability \nassessments. \n \n22.  Expanded and efficiently implemented pipeline of PPP projects. This output will \nsupport  the  expansion  of  the  PPP  project  pipeline  and  project  delivery  through  continued \ninstitutional  development  and  improvements  to  the  planning,  procurement,  and  audit \nprocedures. For subprogram 1, the government has signed six national, PDMF-supported PPP \nprojects in transport, health, and education, for a total investment of $1.5 billion. An additional \n10 feasibility studies have been completed for new projects. The government has strengthened \nthe medium- and long-term transport infrastructure planning and programming frameworks,14 \nand NEDA has finalized the Roadmap for Infrastructure Development for Metro Manila. NEDA \nhas also initiated preparation of the Philippines Transport Infrastructure Roadmap. \n \n23.  The government has improved the capacity of the PPP Center by: (i) allocating more \nresources  to  the  PDMF;  (ii)  increasing  the  center\u2019s  permanent  staff,  where  50%  of  the \nprofessional staff are women; and (iii) adopting new guidelines that operationalize probity in \nPPP projects\u2019 procurement, oversight support during implementation, and development of local \nPPPs. With the objective of improving and speeding up the quality of PPP project approvals, the \ngovernment has introduced a new appraisal process for PPP projects, clearly defining the \nresponsibilities of the leading agencies (PPP Center, DOF, and NEDA). \n \n24.  Mindful  of  the  need  to  boost  the  capacity  of  PPP  projects\u2019  national  and  local \nimplementing agencies, the DOTC has strengthened its management structure with a dedicated \nassistant secretary position to oversee PPP project implementation. In addition, the DOTC has \nestablished  an  ad  hoc  contract  management  unit  for  PPP  projects,  and  is  requesting  the \nDepartment of Budget and Management to establish a permanent PPP implementation unit. To \nassist the identification and development of local PPP projects, the PPP Center has adopted an \nLGU  engagement  strategy  that  envisages  support  to  LGUs  via  in-house  project-based \ninternships, partnerships with training institutions, and the establishment of separate project \ndevelopment facilities for LGU PPP projects. \n \n25.  Subprogram 2 of the programmatic approach will support: (i) at least 10 national PPP \nprojects competitively tendered and awarded through the PDMF; (ii) the preparation of feasibility \nstudies and bidding documents for at least five LGU PPP projects; and (iii) the adoption of the \nPhilippine  Transport  Infrastructure  Roadmap,  integrating  policy  initiatives,  strategies,  and \nactions on transport infrastructure. Under subprogram 2, the government will continue to boost \n                                                \n14 More than two-thirds of the PPP projects in the pipeline are in the transport sector. Of these, some 50% concern \nurban transit, airports, and rails covered by the DOTC. ", "7 \nthe capacity of the PPP Center with adequate allocations to the PDMF, and through the testing \nof probity in procurement of at least five national PPP projects and the recruitment of contract \nsupervision consultants for at least five projects. The government will provide capacity building \nto the PPP Center and project implementation units of the implementing agencies. The PPP \nCenter will sign agreements with at least five LGUs, and will start delivering programmatic \ncapacity-building support to these selected LGUs. \n \n26.  Strengthened legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs. This output will support the \ncompletion and subsequent implementation of legal and regulatory reforms required to sustain \nan efficient PPP program. For subprogram 1, the government has supported the adoption, by \nthe PPP Governing Board, and the submission to Congress of amendments to the BOT law that \nare critical in sustaining the PPP program.15 The amendments include: (i) the institutionalization \nof the PPP Governing Board, the empowered PPP Center, and the PDMF and its consultant \nengagement framework; (ii) the institutionalization of the new process of appraisal of PPP \nprojects, and the funding for the government\u2019s direct and contingent liabilities arising from PPP \nprojects;  and  (iii)  an  improved  process  for  efficient  collaboration,  coordination,  and \naccountability of government agencies involved in PPP projects. \n \n27.  The government has drafted new implementing rules and regulations on alternative \ndispute  resolution  (methods  such  as  arbitration  or  mediation  that  avoid  litigation)  in  PPP \nprojects. These rules will create a more inviting climate for private investments by making the \nresolution  of  disputes  arising  from  a contract  less  expensive,  tedious,  complex,  and time-\nconsuming.  To  improve  the  quality  of  PPP  projects  and  contractual  arrangements,  the \ngovernment has issued guidelines on material adverse government action16 and termination \npayments, defining principles for calculation that will be included in standard contracts. \n \n28.  For subprogram 2, the government will keep improving the PPP implementation and \nregulatory frameworks. This will include support to the adoption of final implementing rules and \nregulations on alternative dispute resolution in PPP projects. In addition, guidelines on material \nadverse government action and termination payments will be reviewed and recommendations \nfor amendments submitted for the consideration of the PPP Governing Board. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n29.  The  loan  for  subprogram  1  is  $300  million,  and  an  equal  amount  is  indicated  for \nsubprogram 2. The Government of Japan is considering parallel financing for Subprogram 1 in \nthe amount of $200 million equivalent. The loan size is based on the financing needs of the \nPhilippines,  the  strength  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and  its  development  impact.  The \nPhilippines\u2019 gross financing needs remain high. In 2015, with a budget deficit target of 2% of \nGDP, the government will need to borrow \u20b1700 billion ($15.6 billion). In 2015, the government \nexpects to borrow an estimated $1.65 billion through official development assistance to close \nthe budget gap. The subprogram 1 loan proceeds will support key development spending in the \n2015  budget,  which  may  include  the  fiscal  costs  from  reform  implementation,  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s share of right-of-way and resettlement costs in PPP projects. \n \n30.  The  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB's \nordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, \n                                                \n15 Current law provides a narrow regulatory framework, focused solely on one PPP modality. Amendments are   \nexpected to lead to a more comprehensive PPP Act. \n16 Any event or action under the control of the government that would adversely impact the economic balance of the \nproject and thereby interfere with the private parties' obligations under the various agreements. \n ", "8 \nincluding a grace period of 3 years (30% annuity amortization method), an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.10 years, and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources, in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17 The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the borrower. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSubprogram 1  Subprogram 2 \nShare of \nSource  Amount   Amount \nTotal (%) \n($ million)  ($ million) \nAsian Development Bank   300.00  300.00  100.00 \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)       \nTotal  300.0  300.00  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  DOF will be the executing agency. NEDA, the Department of Budget and Management, \nDOTC, DPWH, and the PPP Center will be the implementing agencies. The program will be \noverseen  by  the  steering  committee,  chaired by  DOF  and  with  implementing  agencies as \nmembers. The steering committee will meet semi-annually (and ad hoc, if needed) to (i) monitor \nprogress in the programmatic approach and (ii) provide guidance and direction to DOF and the \nimplementing agencies for the execution of the policy actions under the programmatic approach \nand the medium-term directions. The government shall invite ADB and development partners to \nparticipate in the meetings of the steering committee as observers. The implementation period \nis June 2013\u2013June 2015 for subprogram 1, and July 2015\u2013June 2017 for subprogram 2. The \nPBLs will be withdrawn upon accomplishment of policy triggers and upon effectiveness of the \nloan. The completion date for subprogram 1 is 31 December 2016. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n32.  The  net  benefits  of  the  program  are  estimated  at  $1.3  billion  (gross  benefits  are \nestimated at $2.5 billion)18 These benefits arise from two main sources: (i) an increase in the \noverall level of infrastructure investment attributed to the PPP program, with the resulting benefit \nderived from the associated increase in value added; and (ii) an increase in the efficiency of \ninfrastructure investment through the lower costs of PPP projects that complement government \ninfrastructure projects ($2.5 billion). This estimate assumes that PPPs are 15% more efficient \n                                                \n17 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n18 The Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides details on \nthe expected costs and benefits associated with the program. The analysis is corroborated by another study: \nInternational Monetary Fund. 2015. Making Public Investment More Efficient. Washington, DC. ", "9 \nthan government projects. However, the program is assessed as still delivering a net benefit if \nPPPs are assumed to be just 7.5% more efficient than government projects. \n \n33.  The costs of the program are estimated to be $1.2 billion (over the period from June \n2013 to June 2017). They comprise budgetary costs to the government ($150 million) in building \nits capacity to undertake PPPs, a portion of the potential costs to the government associated \nwith contingent liabilities (about $820 million), and the costs to the private sector of submitting \nbids for PPPs ($250 million). Other potential budgetary outlays by the government associated \nwith PPPs relate to provisions for right-of-way and resettlement costs, access roads to major \nairports and RORO facilities, and the VGF scheme. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n34.  The fiscal consolidation efforts led by the government since 2010 have allowed raising \nthe ratio of revenue to GDP, and the prioritization of expenditure toward key areas for inclusive \ngrowth, including education, health, safety net, and public infrastructure. The government\u2019s \npublic financial management (PFM) system has improved with the implementation of the 2011 \nPFM Reform Roadmap, especially in the areas of comprehensiveness of information, fiscal risk \noversight, annual budget process, and in-year reporting. Progress includes the adoption of the \nunified account code structure, which harmonizes budget classification and account codes to \nintegrate budgeting and accounting, and the treasury single account, which consolidates the \ngovernment\u2019s  fragmented  banking  arrangements  and  improves  cash  management.  Other \ninitiatives involve the adoption of new accounting and auditing standards that are in line with \ninternational standards,  and  the  execution  of the citizen  participatory  audit.  The remaining \nchallenges in the PFM system concern budget credibility, predictability and control in budget \nexecution, and external scrutiny and audit. \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DOF. The Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Cabinet Cluster of \nthe Philippines is developing a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan, \ndrawing on a review of the National Anti-Corruption Plan of Action. Initiatives are under way to \nstrengthen the capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman and the justice sector. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n36.  The  potential  beneficiaries  of  the  program  will  include  enterprises,  consumers, \nemployees,  and  the  poor  in  general.  Enterprises  will  benefit  from  greater  competitiveness \nthanks to better infrastructure provision. Consumers will gain from more domestic competition \nthat  will  lower  prices  and  improve  services  (e.g.,  in  the  tourism  sector  thanks  to  better \nconnectivity). The labor market will be  one of the most important channels through which \nreforms under the program will create jobs and help reduce poverty. Better access to services \nthrough enhanced infrastructure endowments is also expected in the medium-term. The PPP \nmanual includes guidelines for gender mainstreaming in gender policies, and three out of nine \nsigned contracts are in education and health. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n37.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is \nclassified under category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nThe assessment of policy actions concludes that no safeguard policies are triggered. \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.19 Untimely complaints from losing bidders are a major risk, which will be \nhandled through the provision of probity advisory services. The expected integrated benefits \nand impacts of the reforms are expected to largely outweigh the associated costs. Medium level \nrisks include uncertainty on the continued provision of budgetary support for (i) right-of-way and \nresettlement  costs  of  PPP  projects  and  for  access  roads  to  airports  and  RORO  facilities,  \n(ii) contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects, and (iii) the activities under the PDMF and \nPPP  Center  at  large.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  inclusion,  in  the  government\u2019s \nmedium-term expenditure framework, of a rolling pipeline of PPP projects that grants continued \nsupport to these areas. The proposed amendments to the BOT law are expected to assist the \ninstitutionalization of the PDMF and the creation of a contingent liabilities fund, financed through \ndedicated budgetary appropriations.  \n \n39.  The  capacity  of  agencies  to  study,  introduce,  and  implement  reforms  may  be \nconstrained by a heavy workload, poor capacity for implementation, and bureaucratic inertia. \nThe program reduces this risk by focusing on high-priority policy reforms, and will support \nsubstantial  capacity  development  assistance  in  PPP  projects  through  a  separate  capacity \ndevelopment TA. Coordination across implementing agencies (national and local governments) \nwill be assisted by the institutional strengthening of the PPP Center. The PPP Center will \npartner with government agencies and private companies that have been working with the \nLGUs in the preparation, financing, and implementation of their priority infrastructure projects. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government and DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Expanding  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Program; and \n(ii)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Expanding  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n27 October 2015\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
