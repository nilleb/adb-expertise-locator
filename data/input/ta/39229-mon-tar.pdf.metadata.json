Agriculture and rural development is vital to economic growth and poverty reduction in \nMongolia. Almost half of Mongolia\u2019s rural population is poor and vulnerable because agricultural \nincomes are low and unstable and rural income opportunities are limited. Based upon the \nGovernment\u2019s request, a 2007 loan for the Agriculture and Rural Development Project (ARDP) \nwas  programmed  in  the  2006\u20132008  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)1 to  address  the \nGovernment\u2019s priority of higher, stable, private-sector-led growth to improve living standards \nand reduce income disparities. The  impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (PPTA), summarized in the project framework (Appendix 1), were finalized during a \nreconnaissance mission in June 2006 and a TA fact-finding mission from 29 June to 5 July 2006. \nThe design has been guided by the Government\u2019s agriculture development strategy and inputs \nfrom the private sector including commercial banks with rural operations, agricultural producers, \ncivil society, and external funding agencies.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  poor  quality  of  agricultural  products  and  unreliable  delivery  of  supplies  restrict \ncommercialization and hinder agriculture and rural development in Mongolia. Natural resource \nconstraints are the primary cause of poor quality and unreliability, but inappropriate production \nmethods  also  play  a  part.  Production  improvements  are  difficult  in  Mongolia\u2019s  harsh \nenvironment.  However,  even  when  improvements  are  undertaken,  through  improved \nmanagement, infrastructure development, or better support services, they frequently do not \ndeliver products needed by the market or downstream enterprises. As a result, the returns to \nagriculture  remain  low  and  agricultural  enterprises  are  unable  to  target  lucrative  markets \nbecause they lack dependable supplies of adequate quality. The ADB-funded Agriculture Sector \nDevelopment Project (ASDP),3 has laid the foundation for production improvements by building \nup  rural  infrastructure  and  support  services,  inducing  changes  in  production  methods  and \nplanning, and changing mindsets of rural producers from centralist approaches to increased \nbusiness awareness, but these achievements need to be channeled towards greater market \norientation. \n \n3.  Inadequate links along the supply chain compound production problems. Links between \nproducers, processors, and markets were disrupted during the transition from central planning \nto a market-based economy. When the supply chain infrastructure collapsed, many previously \nstate-supported enterprises along it ceased operations. Disruptions in the supply chain obstruct \nthe passage of market signals and limit the coordination of production and investment decisions. \nMoreover, with many small producers scattered over large areas, coordination is particularly \ndifficult. While many previous development programs, including those under the ASDP, have \nassisted different players along the supply chain, the coordination of this support is an essential \nnext step. \n \n4.  Inadequate  term  finance  at  affordable  rates  constrains  the  development  of  the \nproduction base and the reestablishment of supply links. Previous ADB support through the \nASDP increased the availability of rural finance, but high borrowing costs and limited availability \nof term loans\u2014reflecting limited long-term liquidity in the financial system and also underlying \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "2  \nrisks  and  uncertainties\u2014continue  to  hold  back  producers  and  enterprises.  Agriculture \nproduction in Mongolia is risky (particularly the unorganized subsistence-oriented production) \ncausing  commercial  banks  to  apply  high-risk  premiums  for  long-term  credit  to  producers. \nFurthermore, commercial banks are uncertain of the potential returns to investments in the \nproduction base. They therefore cannot assess the financial viability of their lending and are \nreluctant to finance such investments without substantial collateral. Without affordable term \nfinance, agricultural producers cannot undertake the investments necessary to meet the quality \nand reliability required by the market. Similarly, agents along the supply chain cannot undertake \ninvestments that would reestablish supply chains, and agriculture enterprises cannot modernize \nand expand operations or invest in the development of their production bases and supply chains. \nTo be effective, an agriculture development project would have to address all three issues\u2014\nproduction improvement, supply chain development, and financing. \n \n5.  Most stakeholders agree that agricultural production would improve if (i) farmers and \nagro-enterprises,  including  those  along  the  supply  chain,  coordinated  their  production  and \ninvestment decisions; and (ii) enterprises at the head of the chain played a more active role in \nsupply development and management. However, due to coordination failure, the major players \nare unwilling to undertake investments unless others do the same. This reluctance to invest is \ncompounded  by  high  interest  rates  and  limited  term  finance.  If  all  parties  made  these \ninvestments together, they would each be better off. \n \n6.  Providing finance to enterprises at the head of supply chains for investments along the \nchain could improve coordination and alleviate some of the risk and uncertainty that increase \nborrowing costs. Lending to enterprises for integrated processing and supply development \nforces a solution to the coordination failure. Since the onward lending by these enterprises to \ntheir  suppliers  is  contingent  upon  the  suppliers  meeting  the  needs  of  the  enterprises, \ninvestments and operations along the supply chain automatically become coordinated within the \nbusiness development model of the large enterprises. At the same time, commercial banks can \ntransfer their uncertainty to agro-enterprises that are better placed to assess risk and manage it \nby controlling production practices, management, and technology. Borrowing costs, therefore, \ncan be reduced. Enterprises can also access insurance schemes for investments along the \nsupply chain that might be out of reach of individual producers. The applicability of such a \nproject  in  the  Mongolian  context  will  have  to  be  studied  carefully.  In  addition,  financing \nmechanisms will have to be specifically designed to target the coordination failure between \nagro-enterprises and producers and the risk and uncertainty that makes borrowing costs high.4 \nLearning  from  the  lessons  of  previous  initiatives,  including  ASDP,  a  project  aimed  at \ncomprehensive agriculture development will have to be accompanied by market development \nfor unique Mongolian products. \n \n7.  If Mongolia tries to compete with its bigger, lower-cost neighbors on the basis of quality \nand production costs alone, it is bound to lose. The country\u2019s traditional production practices \nand  unique  geographical  characteristics  do  not  lend  themselves  to  the  mass  production \n                                                 \n4  The rationale for providing incentives to make such financing acceptable to lending institutions and borrowers also \nneeds to be carefully examined. Lending institutions might need incentives to adopt an unfamiliar lending modality \nuntil they develop the capacity to develop and manage financial instruments to meet the demand for term \nfinancing. Also agro-enterprises and producers might be reluctant to undertake such borrowing without incentives. \nThey will need to go through an initial period of learning where they improve coordinated production and \nmanagement methods, set up effective delivery systems, adopt appropriate technology, and establish information \nsystems. It is expected that over the longer term, commercial banks will be able to provide such lending \nindependently as they develop the capacity to manage it. As the operational model is demonstrated, it is expected \nthat other enterprises and producers will be able to adopt the same model without incentives. \n ", "  3\nmethods that help its neighbors to standardize production and reduce costs. However, Mongolia \ncan capitalize on these same unique production qualities because they are considered attractive \nin  niche  international  markets.  Consumers  in  rich  countries  are  attracted  to  Mongolia\u2019s \ntraditional production practices (e.g., chemical-free production, environment-friendly practices, \nfree-range livestock) and its unique farming culture and lifestyle (e.g. nomadic lifestyle, family \nproduction, traditional relationship with animals and nature), which contrast the mass production \nmethods of its neighbors. These qualities provide a basis for a distinct identity or \u201cbrand\u201d that \ndifferentiates Mongolia\u2019s agricultural products from those of other countries and commands an \ninternational premium. Agricultural production directed to these niche markets could be a source \nof growth. \n \n8.  A  reorientation  of  production  toward  a  well-targeted  brand  image  could  encourage \nsustainable agriculture and rural development in Mongolia. Brand recognition would provide \nlong-term  security  and  growth  to  Mongolia\u2019s  agriculture  sector  by  providing  competitive \ndifferentiation,  fetching  premium  prices,  increasing  sales  volumes,  securing  demand,  and \nreducing vulnerability to fluctuations in international commodities prices. The brand will require \nenvironmentally sustainable production along the supply chain. Such brand development will \nrequire  coordinated  efforts  from  a  range  of  agents\u2014the  Government,  suppliers,  farmers, \nprocessors, service providers, and exporters. It will require well-planned and executed steps. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The PPTA will prepare the ARDP to enable at least eight large agriculture enterprises to \nmeet  demands  of  niche  markets  in  rich  countries.5 The  ARDP  foresees  investments  in: \n(i) expansion, modernization, management, and marketing of enterprises at the heads of supply \nchains and enterprises along the chains, (ii) improved agricultural production practices, (iii) rural \ninfrastructure and support services, and (iv) brand development activities. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The PPTA will prepare a project that will establish sustainable agro-enterprises and a \nsustainable production base. The outcome of the PPTA will be the agreed design of the ARDP. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The output of the PPTA will be a document that analyzes and describes investments to \nbe  supported  under  the  project,  implementation  arrangements,  and  associated  technical \nassistance needs. The PPTA will have two components: (i) agriculture development and (ii) \nbrand development. Both components will be based upon international market assessments to \nidentify  niche  markets  for  Mongolian  agriculture  products.  For  the  agriculture  development \ncomponent, the PPTA will conduct a baseline survey of the agribusiness sector, select agro-\nenterprises capable of meeting the demands of the niche markets, and identify investments to \nbe  funded  by  the  project\u2014in  the  expansion,  modernization,  improved  management,  and \nmarketing  of  agro-enterprises  and  agriculture  producers.  In  parallel,  the  Government  and \nstakeholders will agree on investments for rural infrastructure, support services, and resource \nmanagement to complement project investments. \n \n                                                 \n5   Large enterprises in the Mongolian context would be those with annual turnovers of more than $500,000. But this \ndefinition will be refined during PPTA implementation. \n ", "4  \n12.  In association with the design of agriculture development investments, the PPTA will \ndesign a brand development campaign for Mongolian agriculture. For this, the PPTA will build \nupon  market  assessments  to  describe  niche  markets,  identify  brand  characteristics,  and \ndevelop a product range in line with brand characteristics. The PPTA will determine the scope of \nthe branding campaign, develop an implementation outline, and estimate costs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to provide $1 million. The PPTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance $250,000 in \nkind by providing counterpart staff and support services, including surveys and documentation. \nThe detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The PPTA is expected to begin in October 2006 and to be completed by September \n2007. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) will be the Executing Agency and it has \nestablished a project working group to monitor implementation. MoFA will appoint a coordinator \nto work with government agencies and other stakeholders. A panel consisting of representatives \nof the private sector, civil society, and Ministries of Food and Agriculture, Industry and Trade, \nand Finance will endorse the selection of investment proposals from agro-enterprises. \n \n15.  The  PPTA  will  require  38  person-months  of  international  and  42  person-months  of \nnational consultant inputs. International consultants for the agriculture development component \nwill be engaged by ADB through single-source selection as described in para. 17.6 Consultants \nfor  the  brand  development  component,  the  agricultural  economist,  the  rural  development \nspecialist, the project economist, the environment specialist, the social development specialist, \nand  consultants  with  expertise  currently  unallocated  will  be  engaged  as  individuals  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Expertise requirements, parallel \nfinancing  arrangements,  terms  of  reference,  and  implementation  schedules  are  detailed  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n16.  Since  ADB  staff  at  the  Mongolia  Resident  Mission  will  directly  supervise  PPTA \nimplementation, reporting requirements will be kept to a minimum. ADB consultants working on \nthe agriculture development component will submit (i) an inception report 4 weeks after the \ncommencement of services; (ii) a report that summarizes bankable proposals for the selection \npanel 16 weeks after the selection of agro-enterprises; (iii) a draft final report that includes the \nanalyses required for project assessment by ADB by week 32 of PPTA implementation; and (iv) \na final report on the completion of the TA. The consultants working on the branding campaign \nwill provide an initial report describing niche markets, brand characteristics, and a product range \n4 weeks after commencement of services and a final report that describes the scope of the \nbranding campaign, develops an implementation outline, and provides cost estimates 12 weeks \n                                                 \n6  Single-source selection is appropriate. PPTA tasks are a continuation of previous work. Continuity in the technical \napproach, experience acquired, and efficiency provides the justification. A team of consultants has been working \non a project funded by the Government of the Netherlands and implemented by GTZ. The initial assignment was \nawarded on a competitive basis. The PPTA is a continuation of their tasks with a minor expansion of scope and \nscale. The consultants have acquired experience in an area where expertise is limited. Finding a new team to \ncontinue their work would be difficult, would involve a loss of efficiency, and would not serve the interests of the \nproject or the client. \n ", "  5\nafter  the  commencement  of  services.  Consultants  will  organize  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences as detailed in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  Partnership with the Private Sector Development Project (PSDP) and Regional \nEconomies Development Program (REDP). The PSDP is funded by the Government of the \nNetherlands and implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) \nin partnership with the Mongolian Ministry of Industry and Trade. For more than 5 years, the \nPSDP has assisted enterprises in developing investment plans and management restructuring \nprograms, and attracting commercial funding. The PSDP, supported by international experts, \nhas developed a pool of national experts capable of undertaking company valuation, diagnostics, \nand investment planning. The REDP, which is funded by German development cooperation \nthrough GTZ, aims to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with business development \nsupport. As agreed with the Government of the Netherlands and GTZ, the scope of PSDP \nactivities will be expanded to cover comprehensive supply chain development and support to \nlarger enterprises than previously. ADB will fund the inputs of PSDP international experts. They \nwill  support  PSDP  national  experts  with  the  preparation  of  ARDP  agriculture development \ninvestments, including business development plans for enterprises along the supply chain, \nwhich  will  also  receive  support  through  the  REDP.  Funding  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands  and  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  will  be  used  to  cover  all \nadministrative expenses and to fund the costs of the PSDP national experts. GTZ expects to be \nable to mobilize additional technical expertise to meet investment-planning needs of enterprises \nthat are of central importance to the REDP.7 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1 million on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for preparing the Agriculture and Rural Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  A more forward-looking collaboration is foreseen among ADB, the Government of the Netherlands, and GTZ during \nthe implementation of the ARDP. Funding from the Government of the Netherlands and/or  GTZ will provide \nmanagement and technical support to enterprises for the implementation of ARDP-funded investment plans. \nEnterprises will be eligible to borrow funds through ARDP to pay for part of the costs of this management and \ntechnical support and PSDP will provide, as grants, part of the costs. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nImpacts      Assumption \n       \nSustainable agro- Improved pasture and  Monitoring and evaluation  \u2022  Agro-enterprises will \nenterprises and  land management  system of MoFA  receive adequate \nproduction base   practices adopted  (strengthened with ADB  management support and \n  assistance)  develop their own \nImproved quality and    management capacity over \nreliability of raw material  Community-based monitoring  the implementation of the \nsupply  and evaluation  project to allow them to \n    implement their proposals. \nValue of agricultural  Annual reports of the   \nexports at least 10%  agricultural enterprises  Risk \nhigher by the end of the    \u2022  Partnerships between \nproject period  Project review missions  enterprises and enterprises \n    along the supply chain \nHigher brand awareness  International and domestic  break down due to \nby the end of the project  surveys  unforeseen reasons. \nperiod   \n  National statistics \n       \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design that  Agreement between ADB  Negotiated loan agreement  \u2022  An internal ADB review will \nresponds to stakeholder  and the Government of  between ADB and the  find the project design to be \nneeds and fulfills ADB  Mongolia on the final  Government of Mongolia.  aligned with ADB strategic \nrequirements and  project design and loan  objectives. \nsafeguard policies  before December 2007   \n  Risks \n\u2022  MoFA wishes to assume a \nmore central role in project \nactivities than is acceptable \nto the private sector. \n\u2022  Priorities change if there is \na change in Government. \n \n       \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nAgriculture  At least eight investment  Staff assessment of draft final  \u2022  A sufficient number of \nDevelopment  proposals identified for  report of PPTA   viable agro-enterprises are \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: Low agriculture growth will put overall \ngrowth at risk. Low, unstable agricultural incomes and limited rural income opportunities are causes of poverty and \nvulnerability. Agriculture, after mining, remains the most significant sector in Mongolia, accounting for one fifth of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Agricultural and agro-processed exports amount to about one fourth of foreign exchange \nearnings. Agriculture is the source of employment for almost half of the total labor force, and the most important \nsource of household income in rural areas. The rural population comprises 43% of Mongolia\u2019s 2.5 million people. \nPoverty in rural areas is estimated to be 43% compared with 30% in urban areas. Subsistence, seminomadic herder \nhouseholds with small herds are recognized as one of the three groups of poor. The natural calamities of 2000\u20132001 \ndemonstrated the vulnerability of herding to natural shocks. Vulnerability also manifests itself in the form of noticeable \nseasonal  consumption  variations  that  reflect  agricultural  production  cycles.  Agriculture  and  rural  development, \ntherefore, is crucial in broadening and sustaining Mongolia\u2019s growth, and providing opportunities for the many poor \nMongolians who have not yet benefited from the transition to a market economy. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nThe poverty analysis will focus on an assessment of income poverty from the perspective of (i) subsistence, semi-\nnomadic herder households and low-income agricultural producers, and (ii) low-income laborers in agro-enterprises. \nSubsistence, Semi-nomadic Herder Households and Low-income Agricultural Producers. While the private \nsector has grown in urban areas, the rural economic base is still weak. Efficiency of the livestock sector\u2014output per \nherder\u2014has declined during the transition period to a near subsistence level, short of both cash and credit. Due to a \nlack of market access, herders are forced to sell their products cheaply. Barter exchange of raw materials for basic \nconsumer goods has created unbalanced trade relations between the city and countryside, resulting in low income \nand poor quality of life in rural areas. Access to credit is particularly difficult for herders and agricultural producers. \nHerders and the rural poor are considered risky because their income is seasonal and their only collateral is livestock, \nwhich is vulnerable to disease and weather conditions. In most cases, the primary sources of credit are local traders, \nshops, or kiosks. Herders migrate within their bag or soum and further if extreme weather demands it. Compounding \nthis problem is the absence of local markets and high cost of fuel in remote aimags. \nLow-income Laborers in Agro-enterprises. Another disadvantaged group in the sector are low-income laborers in \nagro-enterprises. Currently, agro-enterprises are not attractive for well-educated laborers due to their unreliable \nseasonal operation. Enterprises often engage less educated people and pay low salaries. Only 0.8 % of professionals \nwork in the agricultural sector although the sector accounts for 46.6% of total employment. \nPoverty Reduction Strategy of the Project. The impact of the project will be to induce growth of the sector by \nsupporting the selected agro-enterprises, improving reliability and quality of agricultural raw material supply, and \ndeveloping a brand image for Mongolian agricultural products. A key indicator to assess project impacts would be \nincome  poverty  in  project  areas.  The  project  will  address  agricultural  production  improvement,  supply  chain \ndevelopment, and financing. These broad-based growth enhancing measures at strategic points along the supply \nchain will be complemented with proactive measures that address (i) income poverty of subsistence herders, low-\nincome agricultural producers, and low-income laborers; and (ii) vulnerability of agricultural workers, especially female \nworkers. Partnerships will be fostered with programs working with herders with few animals, women producers at or \nbelow the poverty threshold, indigenous people, and agricultural producers and agro-enterprises with large numbers of \npoor employees to maximize the participation of these groups in project activities. \n \nA detailed poverty and social assessment (PSA) during the implementation of the project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA) will provide an in-depth picture of rural poverty, particularly among indigenous groups and specific \nneeds and interests of rural people. In addition, the PSA will identify the capacity of existing civic groups and \nrecommend how these groups could be mobilized during project implementation. The PSA will also recommend \nspecific project design features to reduce poverty. Special attention will be given to address the needs of indigenous \npeople and ensure that these groups benefit from the project. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe poverty analysis also provides the basis for a detailed stakeholder analysis during PPTA implementation. \nStakeholder beneficiaries are: (i) subsistence, semi-nomadic herder households with small herds; (ii) agricultural \nproducers without established market access; (iii) owners of and laborers in agricultural enterprises; (iv) service \nproviders and traders; and possibly (v) migrants in urban centers and on their peripheries. \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe PPTA will develop a participation strategy. The PPTA will aim to maximize civil society participation in project \nimplementation and monitoring and the participation of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for the improvement of \nthe  production  base.  A  panel  of  representatives  from  the  private  sector,  farming  community,  NGOs,  and  the \nGovernment will select agro-enterprises to be included in the scope of the project. The PPTA will develop the detailed \nterms of reference for the participatory features of the implementation arrangements and particularly for civil society \nparticipation in project monitoring. The NGO and Civil Society Center will be requested to provide expertise to design \nthe participation strategy and the participatory features of the implementation arrangements. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nThe TA is expected to generate employment for women in agro-enterprises and improve their access to producer and \nmarketing organizations. Ongoing projects funded by ADB and development partners will assist in these activities.  \nEfforts will be made to establish partnerships with projects that are building the capacity of women to develop \nbusiness plans, set up a product development, manage businesses, improve marketing, and gain better access to \ncredit. The PPTA will develop a detailed gender action plan. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nAn output will be prepared by the end of the PPTA. \n \nE.
