INTRODUCTION\n2. The power sector in Bangladesh performed poorly through the late 1980s and 1990s.\nThe major constraints in the sector were (i) lack of institutional capability; (ii) unavailability of\nlong-term domestic capital for financing investments; (iii) limited foreign exchange debt service\ncapability of the economy; (iv) poor management systems and procedures; (v) low employee\ncommitment; and (vi) institutional weaknesses in governance, banking, law enforcement, and\njudicial processes, which are external to the sector but are essential for its proper functioning.\n3. In 1994, the Government of Bangladesh adopted a paper titled Power Sector Reforms in\nBangladesh (PSRB), which was formulated in consultation with the major development partners\n(DPs)1 in the power sector. The PSRB outlined the reform process proposed to be followed by\nthe Government to gradually remove the constraints in the sector through improvements in\nsector and corporate governance, introduction of competition, and public-private partnerships.\nReform of the external environment was to be done through targeted interventions in the power\nsector.\n4. In accordance with the PSRB, the power sector in Bangladesh has gradually been\nundergoing structural changes. The DPs have been supporting these changes through technical\nassistance for planning and institutional strengthening as well as capital for system expansion,\nin line with the principle of reforms-linked assistance. Prior to the West Zone Power System\nDevelopment Project (the Project), assistance by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had focus\non  the  greater  Dhaka  area,  given  its  commercial  and  political  importance  to  Bangladesh.\nHowever,  while  the  greater  Dhaka  area  has  considerably  improved  both  physically  and\nfinancially (although by no means near financial viability and sustainability as yet), the other\nregions of the country, which have not been able to attract aid or private sector capital, have\nbeen  falling  behind  in  physical  infrastructure  as  well  as  progress  of  reforms.  The  Project\nproposes to correct this imbalance by providing assistance to the western region of Bangladesh.\n5. The Project, which will be the fourth assistance provided by ADB in support of the reform\nprocess, is part of ADB's 2001 Country Assistance Program for Bangladesh. The Project is an\nintegral part of the least-cost development plan for the power sector, and is accorded high\npriority  by  the  Government.  Loan  fact-finding  was  carried  out  during  7\u201317  May  2001  and\nappraisal during 26 September - 2 October 2001.2\n                  \n1  The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the Department for International Development of the UK, the Japan\nBank for International Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau for the Government of Germany, and the United\nStates Agency for International Development.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised S.

BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n6. The power sector in Bangladesh is organized under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral\nResources. The Government, through the ministry, wholly owns and supervises the Bangladesh\nPower Development Board (BPDB), the Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), and the Rural\nElectrification Board (REB), which are its three executing agencies in the sector. Till fiscal year\nFY1998, BPDB was responsible for all generation and most of the transmission in the country,\nand also for distribution in district towns, municipalities, and some rural areas, while DESA was\nresponsible for distribution in the greater Dhaka area, including the capital city. The distribution of\nelectricity in most of the rural areas of Bangladesh is the responsibility of the 67 rural electric\ncooperatives or Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs), which are organized, initially funded, and monitored\nby REB. As part of the sector reform process, new public sector entities such as the Power Grid\nCompany of Bangladesh Ltd. (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd. (DESCO)\nas  well  as  private  sector  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  such  as  the  Rural  Power\nCompany Ltd. (RPC),3 the Meghnaghat AES Power Company Ltd.,4 and the Haripur AES Power\nCompany Ltd. have been constituted. Over the next few years, these companies will own and\noperate a substantial part of the power sector\u2019s assets. The distribution subsector has also seen\na major rationalization of distribution territory between DESA and the PBSs. The Government,\nBPDB, and REB have taken steps to involve the private sector by (i) adopting a private power\ngeneration policy in October 1996, (ii) adopting a small power generation policy in 1998 to\nencourage distributed generation, and (iii) awarding contracts for about 1,800 megawatts (MW)\nof generating capacity on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis.\n7. Bangladesh\u2019s annual per capita electricity consumption of 87 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in\nFY2001 was the third lowest among ADB's developing member countries, after Cambodia and\nNepal.5 Despite intensive efforts to increase coverage, only about 20 percent of the population\nhas access to electricity.6 Consumption of electricity in Bangladesh has increased at an average\nannual  rate  of  8.5  percent  from  FY1994  to  FY2001,  with  major increases  in  industrial  and\nresidential use. The ADB-financed Power System Master Plan Study7 estimated that the demand\nfor electricity will increase by about 8 percent per year for the next 10 years. The current installed\ncapacity is 4,035 MW. The peak demand met was 3,096 MW on 3 July 2001.\n8. Inadequate supply of electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY1999,\nload shedding in the range 16-774 MW was resorted to on 335 days for a total duration of 1,690\nhours. The situation improved in FY2000 and FY2001 with load shedding restricted to 15-663\nMW on 251 days for a total duration of 948 hours. The situation will improve further in FY2002\nwith (i) elimination of gas supply constraints to power stations, (ii) full commissioning of the\n                  \n3  The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 68 percent of its shares held by the private sector rural electric cooperative\nand 32 percent by the public sector REB. It was established in 1994 as part of the policy dialogue for ADB\nLoan 1356-BAN(SF): Rural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995.\n4  Supported by ADB through TA 2338-BAN: Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Power\nProject, for $211,000, approved on 30 May 1995 and enhanced to $595,000 in March 1998; and Investment Loan\n7165/1793-BAN: AES Meghnaghat Power Project,  for  $50  million  loan;  31909-BAN  $70  million  partial  risk\nguarantee and complementary financing scheme no. 39, for $20 million, all approved on 5 December 2000.\n5  In 2001, the annual per capita consumption was 55 kWh in Nepal and 30 kWh in Cambodia. Comparable figures\nfor some other developing member countries (DMCs) were 340 kWh for India, and 950 kWh for Thailand.\n6  Comparable figures for some other DMCs are less than 10 percent for Cambodia, 18 percent for Nepal, 82 percent\nfor India, 48 percent for Pakistan, and 98 percent for Thailand.\n7  TA 1962-BAN: Preparation of a Power System Master Plan, for $600,000, approved on 11  October 1993.\nCompleted in early 1995.", "3\nHaripur  IPP  station,  (iii)  part  commissioning  of  the  Meghnaghat-I  IPP  station,  and  (iv)\nreinforcement of the Dhaka 230 kV ring and completion of the Rampura 230 kV substation.\nSome load shedding is expected to continue until substantial new generation capacity is added\nto the system to (i) replace very old power stations, (ii) allow for routine preventive maintenance\nthrough creation of reserve margin, and (iii) meet the additional demand from new connections\nand suppressed load growth. Erratic power supply has tended to increase the unwillingness of\nconsumers to pay their bills, which in turn has led to shortages of funds for maintenance and has\nfurther aggravated the situation.\n9. After DESCO became operational in 1998, and distribution territory between DESA and\nthe PBSs was rationalized, the sector\u2019s financial situation improved (Table 1).\nTable 1: Performance of the Power Sector, FY1998 and FY2000\nDistribution Share Distribution Losses Revenue\nFY1998 FY2000 (% of imports) Collections\n(% of billings)\nGWH % GWH % FY1998 FY2000 FY1998 FY2000\nBPDB 3,485 42 5,888 38 29.1 24.9 81 86\nDESA 3239 39 4,745 31 30.1 36.6 80 88\nPBSs 1,435 17 4,114 27 16.5 17.7 96 94\nDESCO     224a   3    628 4 46.7a 29.9 88a 80\nTotal 8,383 100 15,375 100\na As the Mirpur Division of DESA prior to its restructuring.\nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric\nSupply Company, Ltd., GWh = Gigawatt-hours, PBSs = rural electric cooperatives.\n10. Bangladesh has limited hydropower potential because the terrain is flat. The Jamuna-\nPadma-Meghna  river  system,  which  runs  north  to  south,  divides  the  country  into  two.  The\ncountry's entire proven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate) estimated at 59 million\nbarrels, and natural gas estimated at 12 trillion cubic feet are on the eastern side of the river\nsystem. The limited hydropower potential is also in the eastern part of the country. The western\npart  has  no  developed  commercial  sources  of  energy.  Coal  reserves,  which  are  in  the\nnorthwestern part, are deep beneath the surface and difficult to develop, and only one potential\nmine with a limited output of about one million tons per annum is being developed with external\nassistance. Consequently, of the country's total installed generation capacity of 4,035 MW, about\n494 MW fueled by diesel oil and heavy fuel oil and 171 MW fueled by natural gas, are in the\nwestern part. Of the 3,370 MW in the eastern part, 3,135 MW is based on natural gas, the\ncountry's primary commercial fuel, and 235 MW on hydropower. In terms of energy generated,\nabout 90 percent of the total in FY2000 was from gas-fired power plants.\n11. In  FY2001,  BPDB's  average  retail  tariff  for  its  ultimate  consumers  was  Tk3.13/kWh\n($0.055/kWh), DESA's was Tk2.83/kWh ($0.050/kWh), DESCO\u2019s was Tk2.95/kWh ($0.052/kWh)\nand  PBS's  Tk3.19/kWh  ($0.054/kWh),  leading  to  a  weighted  average  tariff  of  Tk3.06/kWh,\n($0.054/kWh),  compared  with  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of  supply  of\nTk3.86/kWh  ($0.068/kWh).  The  LRMC  is,  however,  declining  due  to  (i)  the  lower  costs  of\nproduction from the larger private sector IPPs, and (ii) declining losses. Retail tariffs are being\nadjusted every six months to reflect increased costs of inputs by way of (i) the increased debt-\nservice burden on the utilities in local currency, caused by the devaluation of the taka; and\n(ii) increase in the price of natural gas.", "4\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n12. The  PSRB  envisions  in  the  long-term  a  structure  of  the  power  sector  based  on\n(i) separation of sector regulation and operation; (ii) autonomy and commercial orientation of the\nsector entities; (iii) separation of generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv) increased\nprivate  sector  participation.  Under  such  a  structure,  a  new  regulatory  authority  would  be\nresponsible  for  (i)  setting  electricity  tariffs  and  determining  the  corresponding  performance\nnorms; (ii) collecting, verifying and disseminating sector statistics; (iii) reviewing and approving\nlong-term power planning; (iv) creating and maintaining a nondiscriminatory and commercial\nbusiness environment in the sector; and (v) adjudicating disputes between sector entities. While\ntransmission will remain in the public sector, generation and distribution assets will have both\npublic and private ownership. The objective is to eliminate monopolies and foster competition.\nCommercial  discipline  and  good  customer  service  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through\ncompetition among entities in the power sector.\n13. With the initiation of reforms in 1994, the organizational setup of the sector has changed.\nWhereas in 1994, all generation was with BPDB, today there are several public/ private and\nprivate  sector  entities  that  have  been  licensed  to  construct  and  operate  power-generating\nfacilities. The first private barge-mounted power station started operations in December 1998.\nThe RPC\u2019s (footnote 3) first gas turbine at its Mymensingh site started operation in April 2000.\nThree barge-mounted power stations totaling about 310 MW are under operation, as is the\nopen-cycle  stage  of  the  Haripur  (360  MW)  IPP  station.  IPPs  under  construction  include\nMeghnaghat-1 (450 MW) (footnote 4) and the 100 MW expansion at Baghabari.\n14. Good governance, at both the sector and the corporate levels is emphasized in the PSRB.\nAt the sector level, governance is to be improved through predictability (long-term planning,\ncodification of rules and regulations, and independence of regulatory processes), transparency\n(systematic dissemination of relevant sector information, public hearings, and discussions on\nissues before they are decided), and accountability (cause-effect structure of incentives). At the\ncorporate level, governance is being enhanced through corporatization, independence of the\nboards of directors from the Government, defined delegation of powers to staff, computerized\nmanagement information systems, and commercialization of activities.\n15. The Government realizes that the investment requirements for the power sector during\n1995\u20132005, estimated at about $6.6 billion, exceed the resources available in the public sector\nand could crowd out investment in other key sectors. Therefore, the Government has made a\npolicy decision to invite the private sector to participate in developing the sector. The Government\nhas made substantial efforts to streamline administrative and commercial procedures and the\nprivate sector has responded positively in its participation in the power sector. To streamline the\nlegislative basis for the sector\u2019s restructuring and regulation, and to allow the establishment of an\nindependent regulatory authority, the Government has drafted a new electricity reform act and has\nintroduced it for consideration of the Parliament. ADB has granted Technical Assistance (TA)8 to\nhelp draft the regulations for the power sector that will be administered by the new regulatory\nauthority.  This  will  permit  depoliticization  of  tariff  setting  and  licensing,  making  the  sector\u2019s\noperations more transparent.\n                  \n8  TA 3129-BAN: Support for an Energy Regulatory Authority, for $900,000, approved on 16 December 1998.", "5\n16. The Government's other priority in the power sector is to improve the operations and\nfinancial positions of BPDB and DESA until their successor organizations develop, and thereby\nreduce its losses in the sector. Over the past five years, as part of its drive to improve the financial\nposition of the sector, the Government has been monitoring and encouraging these two utilities to\nimprove their technical operations, as well as their billing and collection procedures. Although the\ncommercial operations of both utilities have improved, they have not reached a level of financial\nviability and sustainability. The improvement process has been slow because of discontinuities in\nsenior management, the politicization of labor unions, and the day-to-day political interference in\noperations. Extensive discussions between the Government and the DPs have focused on the\nneed to (i) improve the operations of BPDB and DESA; (ii) increase the participation of more\nefficient agencies, such as REB; and (iii) create new sector agencies that will be commercially\noriented. Many of these steps have been implemented.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n17. Investment in the power sector during the last decade totaled $3.5 billion (Appendix 1).\nThe  major  sources  of  funding  have  been  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  France,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau of Germany (KfW), Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Department\nfor  International  Development  of  UK  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment  (USAID),  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC),  People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, and Russia. Other sources include the Islamic Development Bank, the\nKuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic  Development,  Saudi  Fund  for  Development,  Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency,  United  Nations\u2019  Development  Programme,  Swedish\nInternational Development Agency, Belgium, Danish International Development Agency, Finnish\nInternational Development Agency, and the private sector.\n18. While ADB has assisted generation, transmission, and distribution in urban and semi-\nurban areas, JBIC has concentrated its assistance on generation and rural electrification projects.\nDFID has financed transmission and distribution in the Dhaka area. USAID has been instrumental\nin establishing and funding REB and the first PBSs, and continues to provide technical support to\nREB and the PBSs. KfW (for the Government of Germany) has assisted in augmenting generating\ncapacity,  and  in  reinforcing  transmission  projects.  Other  aid  agencies  have  also  financed\ngeneration  projects,  although  France  and  OPEC  have  financed  some  transmission  and\ndistribution projects as well. The World Bank had earlier supported distribution in smaller towns\nand rural areas. However, after the reforms were initiated, it has not provided any assistance to\nthe sector other than TA for soliciting private participation in power generation and establishing the\nPower Cell which is mandated to plan and execute reform related activities and act as a\nquasi-regulator until the statutory regulator is appointed.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n1. Contextual Issues\n19. ADB has been extensively supporting the power sector over the last 25 years. From being\na provider of funds for individual projects in the 1970s, it became a provider of funds as well as\ntechnical advice in the 1980s. Since the adoption of the PSRB in 1994, ADB has been providing\npolicy advice to the Government in implementing the PSRB, as well as funds to help achieve the\nleast cost expansion program. During this involvement, ADB has learned the following lessons.\n20. Overall Macroeconomic/Political Issues. Macroeconomic/political issues of the country\nhave a significant bearing on the sector's performance as well as its ability to reform. Political", "6\nunrest, labor militancy, law and order enforcement, speed and quality of the judicial processes,\nand ability of the education system to provide the staff required for efficiently operating the sector,\nall affect the sector's performance. However, there is very little that the sector by itself can do to\nsystematically redress these problems. Thus at any point in time, power sector development can\nonly proceed up to a point and no more. Forcing actions beyond this point without removing the\nconstraints becomes dysfunctional and even jeopardizes the reform process.\n21. Sector Entities. Delegation of powers from the Government to the management of the\nsector entities and from the management to the staff is crucial for speedy and efficient decision\nmaking. Due to efforts by ADB, delegation of power has been significantly improved, resulting in\nspeedier decisions on procurement by the newly established companies. BPDB and DESA are\nalso  restricted  by  the  Government's  personnel  and  wage  policies;  therefore,  recruiting  and\nretaining of competent staff and retrenching or dismissing of excess or nonperforming staff are\ninhibited. The situation is being addressed and a beginning has been made by PGCB and\nDESCO. The above factors clearly underscore the limited extent of the improvements that can\nbe made to the existing power sector entities in their present form. It is therefore essential to (i)\ncreate new sector entities that are not subject to the organizational limitations of BPDB and\nDESA, and (ii) establish an overall environment of commercialization in the sector.\n22. Gradualism. Fundamental changes in infrastructure sectors take time to implement even\nin  developed  countries.  In  developing  countries,  change  is  more  difficult  to  implement  and,\ntherefore, requires a gradual approach. Speeding up reforms is functional only if the change is\ncomprehensive. For example, increasing tariffs too rapidly may help the finances of the sector but\noften undermines the objectives of the reforms by penalizing the good consumer if the utilities\ncollect only from a low percentage of consumers. Affordability is also a factor. Rapid rises in tariffs\ncan drive up the costs of electricity so that it becomes unaffordable to the poorer consumers,\nwhereas  more  gradual  increases  could  have  allowed  time  for  managing  the  effects  of  the\nincrease.\n2. Compliance with Reforms Actions Under Earlier ADB Loans\n23. The ADB-financed Eighth Power Project9 closed on 23 February 2001 and the Rural\nElectrification  Project  (footnote  3)  on  29  January  2001.  All  structural  reform-related\nconditionalities stipulated in these loans have been met. While several of the restructuring\nconditionalities stipulated under the ongoing Ninth Power Project10 and Dhaka Power System\nUpgrade Project11 have been fulfilled, some are still to be met as indicated below.\n24. Handing over Transmission Assets to PGCB. BPDB and PGCB have jointly proposed\nthe physical and legal transfer of all transmission assets of BPDB to PGCB by September 2002.\nThe Government approved this plan in May 2001. The agreement needs to be followed by the\nphysical handover of assets, transfer of related personnel, finalization of the associated financial\ntransactions, and establishment of PGCB's partial tariffs. Considerable progress has been made\nin this area. PGCB\u2019s partial tariffs have been notified and approval for payment of termination\nbenefits and transfer of BPDB personnel to PGCB were approved on 6 September 2001.\nForty-five percent of BPDB\u2019s transmission assets have already been transferred to PGCB.\n                  \n9  Loan No. 963-BAN(SF): Eight Power Project, for SDR 132.677 million approved on 11 July 1989.\n10 Loan No. 1505-BAN(SF): Ninth Power Project for SDR 92.931 million approved on 18 December 1996.\n11 Loan No. 1730/1731-BAN: Dhaka Power Systems Upgrade Project, for SDR 54.319 million plus $82.0 million,\napproved on 21 December 1999.", "7\n25. Corporatizing Ashuganj Power Station. Ashuganj Power Company was incorporated\nin June 2000, and its first board of directors constituted in September 2001. The board has\ninitiated the process for recruiting the company\u2019s first management.\n26. Handing over DESA's Gulshan Circle Assets to DESCO. Physical handover is to be\ncompleted by December 2002. Legal and financial aspects need to be settled by early 2002 to\nallow the transfer. DESCO also needs to establish its own billing and financial accounting center\nby early 2002 to accept the transfer of customer records from DESA.\n27. Liquidating the Government\u2019s dues to BPDB, REB, and DESA. It is imperative for\nthe Government to lead in commercializing the sector by liquidating the arrears owed by it and\nits agencies to BPDB and DESA. In September 2001, the Government made a special budget\nallocation of Tk690 million (about 30 percent of total dues) to settle outstanding dues to BPDB\nand DESA. This process will be expanded to include DESCO and PBSs also.\n28. The fulfillment of conditions related to restructuring has been delayed in some cases by\nover a year. Nevertheless, the Government must be complimented in its determination to follow\nthrough with these politically difficult and sensitive actions. Some actions have led to law and\norder problems that the Government had to tackle firmly. Since the reform program started in\n1994, the Government has always delivered on the conditionalities it has agreed to as part of the\nprocess of power sector reforms. The Government has also, on its own, started the process of\nrationalizing retail electricity tariffs for residential consumers of BPDB and DESA, as also the base\nretail tariffs for the sector. This gives DPs confidence that the Government will take necessary\nactions to determinedly pursue reforms in the future.\n3. Performance of Executing Agencies\n29. The political unrest in the country over the last few years has significantly affected the\ncollection operations of both BPDB and DESA since many commercial establishments, including\nbanks, were closed for prolonged periods and those that were open functioned with minimal\nservices. DESA was particularly hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the\nunrest, and normal life in the city was disrupted for longer periods than in other towns. During\nFY2000, the collection-to-generation ratio of BPDB and the collection-to-import ratio of DESA\nwere 65.9 percent and 65.1 percent, respectively. These were way below the targets, which\nwere  75 percent  for  BPDB  and  70  percent  for  DESA.  In  FY2001,  however,  with  the\nimplementation of the ADB-funded Financial Management Upgrade Project,12 the collection\nperformance of both utilities has gone up dramatically, resulting in a collection-generation ratio\nof 70.8 percent for BPDB. DESA\u2019s performance remained stagnant on account of the deferred\npayments instituted with the PBSs that had just taken over DESA\u2019s loss-incurring rural areas in\nFY1999. The performance of the seven PBSs supported by ADB in the Rural Electrification\nProject (footnote 3) has been very good, with an average collection-to-import ratio of over 85\npercent. REB\u2019s (PBSs\u2019) overall collection-import performance slightly deteriorated to 77.4 percent\nin FY2001 on account of the bad areas taken over from DESA. However, the trends are in the\nright direction and these PBSs should contribute positively to the sector\u2019s financial viability in\nFY2002. The operational performance of BPDB, DESA, REB and DESCO over the last eight\nyears since the start of reforms is summarized in Table 2.\n                  \n12 TA 2004-BAN: Financial Management Upgrade of BPDB and DESA, for $1,000,000, approved on 26 November\n1993.", "8\nTable 2: Operational Performance of the Power Sector, FY1994\u2013FY2001\nItem 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001\nGeneration, MkWh\nBPDB (gross)       9,784 10,806    11,475    11,858    12,870    14,450    15,563    17,021\nIPP         578         824      2,248\nNet       9,221    10,166   10,845  11,243  12,182   13,634    14,739    16,309\nEnergy Import and Sales, (MkWh)\nGross BPDB Sales       7,441     8,372      8,996      9,447    10,177    11,351    12,469    14,002\nImport by BPDB Zones       5,082     5,586     5,825     5,810   6,238      7,045      7,515      8,324\nSales by BPDB Zones        3,745      4,209      4,445      4,485      4,757      5,405      5,965      6,762\nImport by DESA        3,696      4,162      4,551      4,962      5,419      5,947      6,504      7,240\nSales by DESA        2,538      2,914      3,209      3,589      3,908      4,469      4,831      5,392\nImport by DESCO         344         550         628\nSales by DESCO         205         369         440\nImport by REB           906      1,247      1,372      1,472      1,718      2,442      3,172      4,114\nSales by REB           765      1,052      1,172      1,220      1,435      1,989      2,546      3,386\nSystem Loss (Percent)\nBPDBa 23.95 22.53 21.60 20.33 20.93 21.45 19.88     17.73\nBPDB Zonesb 26.32 24.65 23.69 22.81 23.73 23.29 20.63     18.76\nBPDB Zones (Net of sales to REB) 30.26 29.42 28.44 27.59 29.09 29.69 26.72     24.93\nDESAb 31.34 30.00 29.49 27.67 27.89 24.84 25.72     25.53\nDESA (Net of Sales to REB and 32.77 31.71 31.30 29.55 30.13 29.89 34.56     36.55\nDESCO)\nDESCOb 40.51 32.86     29.86\nREBb 15.61 15.67 14.60 17.15 16.46 18.55 19.74     17.68\nOverall Power Systema 37.23 35.90 35.04 34.04 34.87 35.77 35.82     33.65\nBilling and Collection (Tk million)\nBPDB Bills      14,067    15,684    16,791    18,487    21,014    23,622    27,359    31,903\nBPDB Collection      11,551    14,142    15,577    16,264    17,018    16,698    22,515    27,436\nDESA Bills        5,962      6,530      7,082      8,648      9,862    10,768    11,423    13,015\nDESA Collection        4,742      5,841      5,998      7,084      7,929      8,200    10,007    11,403\nDESCO Bills         569      1,067      1,297\nDESCO Collection         337         836      1,042\nREB Bills        2,101      2,710      3,180      3,518      4,448      6,139      7,837    10,810\nREB Collection        2,079      2,594      3,124      3,348      4,253      5,763      7,596    10,164\nCollection (as percent of Billing)\nBPDB 82.11 90.17 92.77 87.98 80.98 70.69 82.29 86.00\nDESA 79.54 89.45 84.69 81.91 80.40 76.15 87.60 87.61\nDESCO 59.23 78.35 80.31\nREB 98.95 95.72 98.24 95.17 95.62 93.88 96.92 94.02\nCollection-generation/Collection-Import ratio (Percent)\nBPDB Collection-Generation 62.45 69.85 72.73 70.09 64.03 55.53 65.93 70.75\nDESA Collection-Import 54.61 62.61 59.72 59.25 57.98 57.24 65.07 65.25\nDESCO Collection-Import - - - - - 35.23 52.60 56.33\nREB Collection-Import 83.51 80.72 83.90 78.85 79.88 76.46 77.79 77.40\nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, IPP = independent power producer, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply\nAuthority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric Power Supply Authority, REB = Rural Electrification Board, MW = megawatts.\nNotes:    1.

ADB recognizes that (i) the substantial external assistance to the sector in the past has\ninduced a tendency in the sector agencies to depend on external assistance for their funding; (ii)\nrecovery and development must come from within the sector; and (iii) the Government and all\nmajor aid agencies must realign their individual strategies to emphasize the objective in (ii). In\nconsultation with the Government and the other DPs involved in the sector, ADB has developed\nits strategy to improve the power sector in Bangladesh. The strategy consists of (i) changes in the\nbusiness environment through corporatization, commercialization, and increasing private sector\nparticipation;  (ii) institutional  improvements  in  BPDB  and  DESA;  (iii)  creation  of  new  sector\nagencies that could serve as role models for the sector; (iv) enlarging the scope of the PBSs; and\n(v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes in the sector. The proposed\nProject addresses items (i), (iii), and (iv) of this strategy. Item (ii) is an ongoing process and item\n(v) has partially been addressed through the PSMP, the creation of the Power Cell, and ADB\u2019s TA\nSupport for an Energy Regulatory Authority (footnote 8).\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n31. ADB, the World Bank, JBIC, DFID, USAID, and KfW, have all been involved in policy\ndialogue with the Government about issues in the power sector, with ADB playing the role of DP\ncoordinator. ADB has played a major role in drawing up the reform assistance strategy of the\nDPs. In addition, it has organized coordination meetings for the power sector in 1992, 1994,\n1995, and 1996, and for the power and natural gas sectors in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001.\nADB-led aid coordination meetings in December 1992, December 1994, and September 1995\ncontributed to the formulation of reforms and identification of reforms-linked projects in the sector.\nADB also provided TAs to review electricity legislation,13 prepare a power system master plan\n(footnote 7), upgrade the financial management of BPDB and DESA (footnote 12), seek private\nsector implementation of the Meghnaghat Project (footnote 4), and corporatize the Ashuganj\nPower Station of BPDB.14 ADB has been instrumental in assisting the Government to draw up a\nplan for the planned transformation of the sector, as well as creation of new sector entities.\n32. The medium-term goals of the policy dialogue with the Government up to 2005 and the\nresults achieved so far are summarized in  Appendix 2. Generation is no longer a monopoly and\nhas  sufficient  private  sector  interest,  and  the  public  sector  stations  are  starting  to  be\ncorporatized and commercialized. A start has been made segregating the transmission function\nand corporatizing it. Distribution is being corporatized in the Dhaka area, and the private sector\nPBSs have increased their share of sales from 13 percent in FY1993 to 27 percent in FY2001\nand will increase this to over 30 percent by FY2005. Average retail power tariffs were increased\nby about 15 percent (in September and December 1996) and an interim formula for semiannual\nadjustment of retail power tariffs to take into account fluctuations in fuel costs and foreign\nexchange  rates  has  been  successfully  implemented.15  On  the  regulatory  side,  work  has\nprogressed through the creation of the Power Cell. Preparatory studies on new legislation,\nsector structure, and tariff framework have been completed. The Electricity Reform Bill 2001,16\nwhich will form the legal basis for power sector reform, is being reviewed by parliament.\n                  \n13 TA 1743-BAN: Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations, for $90,000, approved on 18 August 1992.\n14 TA 3343-BAN: Corporatization of Ashuganj Power Station, for $1,000,000, approved on 17 December 1999.\n15 Agreed upon as part of the policy dialogue under ADB\u2019s Loan 1505-BAN (SF): Ninth Power Project.\n16 Supported by ADB under TA 1743-BAN (footnote 10) as well as by a World Bank TA.", "10\nG.  Aid Coordination\n33. Aid coordination in the sector has been intensive since the start of the reform process.\nThe DPs hold a formal coordination meeting every year where sector policies and achievements\nare reviewed by headquarters staff, and over the last year have introduced quarterly meetings\nat the Resident Mission level to monitor progress. Informal views are also exchanged between\nADB  missions  that  visit  Dhaka  and  the  resident  missions/  offices  of  other  DPs  whenever\npossible. Regular visits by senior ADB staff to Washington, and World Bank staff to Manila have\nalso ensured that there is full exchange of views between the World Bank and ADB. Aide-\nmemoires of ADB missions are shared with all DPs, and points of specific concern to any DP\nare discussed by email and telephone.\n34. As is to be expected in such a complex sector, there are differences in views and\nperceptions among some of the DPs. However, these differences are not on the fundamentals\nof the reform strategy being adopted, but on the pace and timing of specific reform actions,\nespecially those related to (i) privatization of distribution; (ii) transfer of assets between BPDB\nand DESA and their successor entities; and (iii) rationalization of tariffs.\n35. The Project has been extensively discussed between ADB and the other DPs and is\nsupported by JBIC, KfW, Nordic Development Fund (NDF), and DFID. JBIC is seeking to\ncomplement the Project through a new loan that will strengthen and intensify rural electrification\nin four PBSs, including one in the Khulna area. KfW and NDF are parallel cofinancing the\nProject.  KfW  has  also  been  in  constant  dialogue  with  the  Government  in  support  of  the\nliquidation of the Government's dues to BPDB and DESA. DFID is actively considering support\nfor the West Zone Electricity Distribution Company that is being established as a successor to\nBPDB\u2019s distribution operations in the west zone.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n36. Poverty reduction is ADB\u2019s overarching goal. Poverty reduction requires expansion in\nthe economy, increase in productivity, as well as equitable distribution of the gains of economic\nexpansion and increased productivity to the entire population. The power sector contributes to\nthis objective by (i) being an essential ingredient for increasing economic growth; and (ii)\nimproving the quality of life of consumers, taking advantage of the information technology\nrevolution  and  employment  opportunities  created,  especially  in  the  rural  areas.  In  the\nBangladesh context, where only about 20 percent of the population has access to electricity,\nthis  means  that  the  electrification  program  in  the  smaller  towns  and  villages  should  be\naccelerated  to  increase  the  population's  access  to  electricity.  However,  increasing  rural\nconnections  is  not  feasible  until  the  entire  supply  chain  comprising  the  generation  and\ntransmission facilities is augmented. The Project, therefore, aims to facilitate generation through\nthe private sector by establishing transmission and distribution lines to help evacuate and utilize\nthe power, at the same time, providing electricity to the district towns and villages in southwest\nBangladesh, a relatively poor area of the country.\n37. The Project continues the long-term strategy of the Government and ADB for power\nsector reforms, which are presented in Appendix 2. The rationale for the choice of the Project\ncomponents is given below.", "11\n1.  Generation\n38. Potential has been created for the private sector to add 1,400 MW of capacity over the\nnext five years. This is 35 percent of the current installed capacity of 4,028 MW and 50 percent\nof the currently available capacity of about 2,800 MW. There is a need to slow down and take\nstock of the situation before further capacity is committed in the private sector. The Government\nhas guaranteed conversion of foreign exchange under the several implementation agreements\nthat were signed or committed to be signed with private sector IPPs, and the amount under\nguarantee represents a significant portion of its total foreign exchange reserves. A \u201cshelf\u201d of\nprojects for speedy implementation already exists. The expansion stages of the Meghnaghat\nproject  offer  the  least-cost  alternatives,  since  their  infrastructure  will  already  have  been\ndeveloped during the first stage. Sites are being identified for 200 MW of peaking capacity in the\nDhaka area, and these sites could be prepared for future expansion through advance actions for\nenvironmental approvals, permits/licenses, and draft operating agreements. The total capacity\nof these projects would be adequate to fulfill the requirements of the east zone in the next five\nyears. In the west zone, the development of the Bheramara/Serajganj sites is being considered\nalong the lines of development of the Meghnaghat site. ADB has already allocated funds under\nits Ninth Power Project for comprehensive studies and development of two peaking power\nplants in the east zone and for a major site for base load generation in the west zone. Hence,\nthere is no priority public sector investment requiring ADB support in this subsector.\n2.  Transmission\n39. In the transmission area, priority investments include (i) the National Load Dispatch\nCenter;  (ii)  the  strengthening  of  the  primary  transmission  system  in  the  west  zone;  (iii)\ncompletion of the 230 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit ring around Dhaka; and (iv) the second east-\nwest interconnector between Ashuganj and Serajganj, utilizing the Bangabandhu Bridge over\nthe Jamuna River.\n40. With the ADB assistance to PGCB under the Ninth Power Project and the Dhaka Power\nSystem Upgrade Project, funding for the 230 kV double circuit ring system around Dhaka has\nbeen secured. The World Bank and JBIC have indicated their possible support for financing the\nNational Load Dispatch Center. Components for strengthening the west zone network and the\nsecond  east-west  interconnector  are  the  only  remaining  works  of  priority  since  these  are\nessential for delivering adequate quantities of secure power to the west zone and also for\nevacuation and economic utilization of power from all the BOO/build-operate-transfer (BOT)\nprojects proposed to be contracted at Serajganj and Bheramara. Hence, these components\nhave been identified for support by ADB, KfW, and NDF.\n3. Distribution\n41. Given the extensive participation of the private sector in generation projects, the financial\nviability  of  the  power  sector  would  be  in  jeopardy  unless  the  distribution  subsector  is\nstrengthened to ensure offtake of power as well as generate adequate revenues for servicing\nthe investments in the generation and transmission subsectors. Otherwise, the Government\u2019s\nguarantees  to  the  IPPs  could  be  called,  placing  an  unacceptable  burden  on  its  budgets.\nThrough its earlier operations, ADB has consolidated the reforms in the distribution subsector in\nthe Dhaka area. It would be prudent to wait for improvements to occur and the reforms to\nproduce the anticipated results before deciding on another round of assistance. Therefore, the\nonly priority would be to assist other major towns to restructure and upgrade their distribution\nnetworks. Given that the southwest is one of the poorer regions in Bangladesh, and upgrading", "12\nof infrastructure is urgently needed to stimulate economic growth for poverty reduction, it would\nbe appropriate if ADB\u2019s next assistance support both urban and rural distribution in this region.\nThis will also provide the opportunity for commencing the corporatization of BPDB's distribution,\nand rationalizing the boundaries between BPDB and REB in the area, leading to lower losses\nand higher collections, and improving the self-sustainability of the sector.\n42. In  the  Dhaka  area,  results  of  the  Financial  Management  Upgrade  Project  (FMU)17\nfunded by ADB, combined with the Pilot Scheme for Loss Reduction supported by JBIC, have\nbeen encouraging. Such reduction in losses, if effected on a large scale, would considerably\nease the financial pressure on the sector. Hence upgrading of distribution in the areas outside\nDhaka and extension of FMU to them, is an ADB priority in the next phase of sector reforms.\n4.  Institutional Strengthening\n43. The Bangladesh power sector will have to rapidly expand if the current low access rate\nof  electricity  is  to  speedily  improve.  Expansion  will  place  a  major  burden  on  the  human\nresources of all agencies in the sector. The present structures of BPDB and DESA are not\nconducive to rapid decision making and commercial accountability. It is therefore proposed that\nas part of the new operation, (i) the west distribution operations of BPDB be corporatized; and\n(ii) the remainder of DESA, which will service the southern part of metropolitan Dhaka after the\nhanding over of assets to DESCO, be corporatized. While the corporatization of DESA will be\naddressed through ADB's proposed TA being considered separately, the corporatization of\nBPDB's distribution in the west zone will be supported through TA and a loan component.18\n44. Based on the above analysis, it is appropriate for ADB to support (i) completion of the\n230 kV  \"backbone\"  transmission  system  in  the  west  zone  and  the  second  east-west\ninterconnector,  (ii)  upgrading  of  urban  and  rural  distribution  in  the  southwest;  and  (iii)\ncorporatization of BPDB's southwest distribution.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n45. The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase electrification in southwest Bangladesh;\n(ii) enable evacuation and economic utilization of the power generated from the projects being\ncontracted at Baghabari and Bheramara; and (iii) reduce losses, improve reliability, and expand\nthe capacity of the transmission and distribution systems in southwest Bangladesh. The logical\nframework for the Project is at Appendix 3.\n46. The Project comprises the following:\n1.  Constructing 230kV Transmission Lines and Substations (Part A)\n(i)  Ishurdi-Baghabari 230 kV double circuit transmission line (55 kilometers [km])19\n(ii)  Baghabari-Bogra  (via  Serajganj)  230  kV  double-circuit  transmission  line\n(110 km)20\n(iii)  Ishurdi-Bheramara-Khulna 230 kV double-circuit transmission line (160 km)\n                  \n17 Supported by ADB through TA 2004-BAN (footnote 9) and Loan 963-BAN (SF): Eighth Power Project for\n$1.0 million each.\n18 DFID has indicated that it may be interested in funding a  \"twinning\" arrangement with a reputed electric\npower utility.

Technical Justification\n47. The Project is part of the least cost expansion plan for the power sector. In addition to\nthe evacuation of power from the current and planned generation capacity in the west zone, the\nProject will also add to the transfer capacity between the east and west zones thus optimizing\nthe generation resources in both regions. This will reduce the cost of power supply in the West\nZone and will lead to better stability and reliability of the power system as a whole. The\ndistribution components in reducing losses, improving the quality of supply, and in supplying\nelectricity to over 500,000 additional consumers, a significant portion of whom live in the rural\nareas. Computerization will result in significant improvements in billing and collections and will\nalso improve customer satisfaction.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n48. The total cost of the Project is estimated $402.1 million equivalent, including foreign\nexchange cost of $259.0 million (64.4 percent) and local currency costs of $143.1 million\n(35.6 percent) A detailed breakdown of the Project's scope along with cost estimates is in\nAppendix 4.

It is proposed that ADB extend two loans to the People's Republic of Bangladesh in\nsupport of this Project. The first loan will be for Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 47.581 million\n($60.2  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  special  funds  resources  and  will  fund  parts  B  (iii)\nthrough(v), and C of the Project. The loan will have a repayment period of 32 years including a\ngrace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter. The borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh and the proceeds\nwill be re-lent to BPDB (and later transferred to its successor companies) and REB pursuant to\nsubsidiary loan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. Relending terms to\nBPDB will include a repayment period of 20 years including a 5 year grace period, and interest\nat the rate of 5.5 percent per annum. The foreign exchange risk will be assumed by BPDB\nduring the life of the subsidiary loan, and by the borrower thereafter. For REB, the relending\nterms will include an interest rate of 2 percent per annum, repayment over 30 years including a", "15\ngrace period of 8 years during which the interest will be 0.75 percent per annum. The borrower\nwill bear the foreign exchange risk.\n51. The second loan23 will be for $138.7 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR)\nand will fund parts A, B (i), and B (ii) of the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including\na grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based\nvariable lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0\npercent (the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversion options that may be\nexercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations,\nADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for the Government\u2019s\ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and\nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent\ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice by ADB. The borrower will\nbe the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. The loan proceeds will be re-lent to PGCB and BPDB\n(and later transferred to the new company) pursuant to subsidiary loan agreements with terms\nand  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  Relending  terms  to  PGCB  and  BPDB  will  include  a\nrepayment period of 20 years including a 5-year grace period, and interest at the rate of 5.5\npercent per annum. Foreign exchange risk will be assumed by PGCB and BPDB during the life\nof the respective subsidiary loan, and thereafter by the borrower.\n52. While  KfW  and  NDF  have  confirmed  their  participation  in  the  Project,  DFID  has\nexpressed interest in considering participation in part B and will be in a position to confirm such\nparticipation only by January 2002. This may result in changes in scope and implementing\narrangements as well as a reduction in ADB\u2019s OCR loan. For the first time, ADB has also\nencouraged PGCB to obtain commercial cofinancing (suppliers\u2019 credit) through international\ncompetitive bidding for $20.1 equivalent for the Ishurdi-Baghabari transmission line.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Implementation Schedule and Performance Review\n53. The implementation schedule of the Project is in Appendix 5. Implementation will begin\nin  November  2001  and  be  completed  in  March  2006.  Direct  supervision  of  subproject\nimplementation and monitoring of subproject operation performance will be the responsibility of\nthe Executing Agencies (EAs) and the Government. These agencies will provide quarterly\nprogress reports to ADB covering their respective responsibilities within 30 days from the end of\neach quarter. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these\nreports and meet with the EAs and the Government semi-annually to discuss project progress.\nADB will also monitor the overall performance of the EAs.\n2.  Procurement\n54. Goods and services financed by ADB will be procured following ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement. For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared so as to ensure maximum\ncompetition under international competitive bidding. A list of the major contract packages under\nthe Project with their cost estimates is given in Appendix 6.\n                  \n23 Refer to note under Table 4  and para. 52. Reduction in ADB financing as a result of bilateral cofinancing will affect\nmainly parts B (i) and (ii) of the Project and hence the OCR loan.", "16\n3.  Consulting Services\n55. Consultants will support PGCB, BPDB, and REB for their respective parts of the Project\nand will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consultants\nwill essentially provide design review, quality assurance services and training.24\n4.  Advance Procurement Action\n56. All the EAs have sufficient expertise in procuring materials for the works entrusted to them\nunder the Project and were allowed to initiate advance procurement action for the goods and\nservices to be financed by ADB. The Government has been advised that ADB's approval of such\nadvance procurement action will not in any way commit it to subsequently approve the Project.\nRetroactive financing has not been permitted.\n5.  Disbursement Procedures\n57. Since the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for supply of goods and\nconsulting services, ADB's commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used for\nthe purpose.\n6.  Reports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n58. The EAs will prepare separate progress reports for their respective components and\nsubmit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a narrative description of\nprogress made during the period, changes in the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties\nencountered, the performance of the project implementation consultants, and the work to be\ncarried out in the next period. The progress reports will also include a summary financial account\nfor  the  Project,  consisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the  period  year  to  date,  and  total\nexpenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on\nthese  reports  and  meet  with  the  EAs  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  project\nprogress. Project completion reports will be submitted to ADB within three months of project\ncompletion.\n59. The EAs will have their annual financial statements and project accounts audited by a\nprofessional auditing firm acceptable to ADB. Unaudited statements will be submitted to ADB\nwithin six months of the close of the financial year and audited statements within three months\nthereafter.\nG.  Executing Agencies\n60. Part A will be executed by PGCB. BPDB will transfer the Ishurdi 230 kV substation, the\nKhulna Central 132 kV substation, and the associated 230 kV and 132 kV transmission lines to\nPGCB before PGCB executes Part A. Part B will be executed by BPDB initially and by its\ncorporatized subsidiary ultimately. REB will implement Part C of the Project.\n                  \n24 DFID stated that it may enlarge the scope of consulting services under part B (ii) and training under B (v) to provide a\ncomprehensive organization development intervention, spanning 3-5 years. If realized, this intervention by DFID will\nbe a major step for power sector reforms in Bangladesh. Selection of consultants will then follow DFID guidelines.", "17\n1. The Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)\na. Responsibilities\n61. PGCB is a limited-liability company registered under the Companies\u2019 Act, 1994. The\nMemorandum of Association of PGCB gives it a wide-ranging mandate to be involved in a\nmultitude of activities, not only in electricity but in any infrastructure project, both in Bangladesh\nand abroad. However, PGCB\u2019s primary role is to act as the owner and operator of the country\u2019s\ntransmission network and the National Load Dispatch Center.\nb. Organization Structure\n62. PGCB is governed by a part-time board of directors elected by its shareholders, who in\nturn appoint a full-time managing director and two functional directors. The chairperson of BPDB\nis the chairperson of the board of directors of PGCB as long as BPDB holds shares in PGCB.\nPGCB has recruited about 550 staff from BPDB in September 2001 as well as received over\n1,200 km of 230 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and four major 230 kV substations. It already\nhas an established project management team that is conversant with ADB\u2019s guidelines, with\nexperience drawn from implementing the ADB-funded Ninth Power and Dhaka Power System\nUpgrade Projects.\nc. Financial Performance\n63. The financial performance of PGCB depends on the rate of transfer of assets from\nBPDB to PGCB. Since the tariff structure applicable to PGCB is based on the net fixed assets in\noperation, and takes into account a post-tax return of 15 percent per annum, the financial\nsituation of PGCB should be fairly robust provided it collects its dues on time. To alleviate\nconcerns in this regard, the Government has already issued two notifications for transmission\ntariffs in 1998 and 2001, taking into account the assets held by PGCB at each time. PGCB\naccounts receivable from BPDB, REB, and DESA have been brought down to the equivalent of\ntwo months billing and steps are being taken to maintain this level. A summary of the financial\nprojections and indicators for PGCB is in Table 5. The financial projections and the critical\nassumptions used in developing the financial projections are in Appendix 7.", "18\nTable 5: Summary of PGCB's Projected Financial Performance,\nFY 2000-2007\n(Tk million)\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nTotal Revenue 172.6 575.8 994.2 1,650.4 2,549.2 4,020.7 5,667.2 7,389.9\nNet Profit 23.8 84.7 317.1 579.3 654.9 706.6 1,218.0 1,897.2\nTotal Assets 3,489.6 6,954.4 19,576.8 30,971.8 43,193.0 55,469.2 64,855.1 70,658.6\nCurrent Liabilities 522.7 263.9 562.0 1,043.6 1,387.9 2,749.1 4,344.7 6,344.9\nLong-Term Liabilities 1,818.3 4,347.6 11,683.1 19,749.2 28,560,6 36,909.2 41,885.4 43,245.3\nEquity 1,148.5 2,342.9 7,331.7 10,179.0 13,244.5 15,810.8 18,625.0 21,068.3\nRate of Return on Net 22.9 2.59 5.3 6.5 4.7 3.5 3.9 4.8\n     Fixed Assets  (%)\nOperating Margin (%) 62.2 63.5 58.5 55.9 53.1 61.7 63.7 66.3\nRate of Return on 2.1 4.9 6.5 6.6 5.6 4.9 7.1 9.6\n     Average Equity (%)\nCurrent Ratio 1.1 5.4 12.4 5.4 4.6 2.7 1.9 1.35\nLong-term 1.6:1 1.9:1 1.6:1 1.9:1 2.2:1 2.3:1 2.3:1 2.1:1\n     Debt-to-Equity Ratio\nDebt-Service Coverage 0.8 neg. 1.4 0.7 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9\n     Ratio (times)\nneg. = negative, PGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Ltd.\n64. The financial projection for PGCB is based on the principles discussed in para. 63,\ntransfer  of  transmission  grid  from  BPDB,  and  investments  derived  from  this  Project.  The\nprojection indicates a sound financial performance over the term of the loan. The debt-to-debt\nplus equity ratio is well above 30 percent during the entire projected period, and the cash flows\nare reasonably sufficient to meet all operating costs and debt and equity service requirements.\n2.  New Company for West Zone Distribution\na.  Responsibilities\n65. The new company will be a limited-liability company registered under the Companies\u2019\nAct, 1994. It\u2019s memorandum of association will give it a wide-ranging mandate to be involved in\na  multitude  of  activities,  not  only  in  electricity  but  in  any  infrastructure  project,  both  in\nBangladesh and abroad. However, the company\u2019s primary responsibility will be to distribute\nelectricity in the metropolitan areas of Khulna, Barisal, Kushtia, Jessore, and Faridpur, and other\nmajor towns in the west zone.\nb.  Organization Structure\n66. The new company will be governed by a part-time board of directors elected by its\nshareholders, who in turn will appoint a full-time managing director and two functional directors", "19\n(finance director and technical director). The chairperson of BPDB will be the chairperson of the\nboard  of  directors  of  the  company  as  long  as  BPDB  holds  a  majority  interest.  For  the\nconstruction and supervision of part B of the Project, the new company is expected to recruit\nabout 20 engineers and about 100 other technical and nontechnical support staff. This will be in\naddition to the 10 or 20 professional and support staff at the corporate office in Khulna to handle\nprocurement, and financial and administrative matters. While most of the staff will be recruited\nfrom BPDB, DESA, and REB on a selection basis, some will be recruited from the open market.\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) staff will be transferred from BPDB\u2019s staff in the distribution\nsubsector.\nc.  Financial Performance\n67. The financial projections for the new distribution company are summarized in Table 6\nand detailed in Appendix 7. These projections are based on a phased transfer of assets from\nBPDB to the new company over five years ending in FY2007. This transfer process could be\naccelerated  if  DFID  decides  to  provide  assistance  to  the  company  for  comprehensive\norganization development. The analysis also assumes that the new company starts off with a\nclean balance sheet and BPDB\u2019s assets will be gradually transferred to it in parallel with the new\nexpansion investments under the Project. It is expected that system losses will be reduced from\nthe current level of 26 percent to about 18 percent by FY2008, further increasing the profitability\nof the company.\nTable 6: Summary of the New West Zone Company\u2019s Projected Financial Performance,\nFY2001-FY2008\n(Tk million)\nItem 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nNo. of Customers 147,246 154,608 160,793 165,616 190,459 247,597 321,875 418,438\nSales (MWh) 823,850 827,527 907,522 977,432 1,044,328 1,247,994 1,651,625 2,185,875\nTotal Revenue 2,495.1 2,613.7 2,997.7 3,376.4 3,754.4 4,659.6 6,431.1 8,882.5\nNet Profit (35.6) (6.2) (6.0) 45.2 185.4 283.8 330.1 700.0\nTotal Assets 2,879.0 2,990.5 4,212.1 5,572.3 6,803.6 7,867.0 8,558.9 9,612.0\nCurrent Liabilities 750.2 583.8 680.2 759.3 865.1 1,261.3 1,835.1 2,400.6\nLong-Term Liabilities 602.5 803.0 1,622.6 2,526.5 3,209.5 3,459.1 3,247.1 3,035.1\nEquity 1,526.3 1,603.8 1,909.3 2,286.5 2,728.9 3,146.6 3,476.7 4,176.3\nOperating Margin (%) (0.3) 0.2 0.4 2.9 8.6 10.0 12.1 15.5\nRate of Return on Total 0.1 1.0 0.7 1.5 3.4 4.1% 6.1 9.4\n     Assets  (%)\nRate of Return on Average (4.7) (0.4) (0.3) 2.2 7.4 9.7 10.0 18.3\n     Equity (%)\nCurrent Ratio 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.8 1.1 1.1 1.4\nEquity Ratio (%) 53.0 53.6 45.3 41.3 40.1 40.0 40.6 43.5\nDebt-Service Coverage (27.0) (4.5) (0.9) 10.2 10.5 33.2 2.9 3.8\n     Ratio (times)\nMWh = megawatt-hours.", "20\n68. The financial projection for the new company is based on the handover of 147,000\ncustomers and a load of 824 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in five cities from BPDB, as well as the\neffects of the investments derived from the Project. With the net value of the transferred assets\nbeing financed as loans and equity in the ratio of 70:30, the expected improvements in losses,\nand the major increase in number of customer and load, the projections indicate a robust\nperformance. The expected increase in number of customers and energy sales during the\nproject  implementation  period  are  271,000  customers  and  1,362  GWh,  (an  increase  of\n284 percent and 339 percent, respectively).  The operating margin gradually increases from 0 to\nroughly 15 percent over seven years along with the decrease in losses and increased load. The\nreturn on total assets also improves from 0 to 9 percent based on the same factors and the\ndeclining new investments later in the period. The financing of the transferred assets gives the\ncompany a very solid foundation, which is indicated by an equity ratio of around 40 percent.\nThis solid foundation will give good opportunities for external financing of future expansions as a\nself-sustainable and independent company.\n3.  Rural Electrification Board/Palli Bidyut Samities\na.  Responsibilities\n69. REB is an infrastructure development agency of the Government. It was created as an\nautonomous  entity  under  a  presidential  ordinance  in  1977,  to  implement  the  electrification\nprogram through consumer cooperatives, the PBSs. The creation of this autonomous body was\none of the recommendations of the consulting firms that conducted feasibility studies for the\nGovernment\u2019s Rural Electrification Program in 1977, which was financed by USAID.\n70. As  stated  in  its  charter,  the  major  functions  of  REB  are  to  (i)  establish  electricity\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution systems in the rural areas of Bangladesh; (ii) organize\nprospective consumers of electricity into formal and informal groups such as societies and\ncompanies; (iii) formulate by-laws for the PBSs and other groups registered with REB, and\ndetermine  the  methods  of  their  operations;  (iv)  advance  funds  for  implementing  approved\nschemes,  operating  and  managing  works  and  services,  and  constructing  lines  for  electric\nconnections for members; (v) hand over to the PBSs the completed projects for O&M and\nmanagement; (vi) train personnel in the management and operation of REB and PBSs; and (vii)\ndevelop standards for work, equipment, O&M, procurement and warehousing, personnel and\nfiscal administration, and other aspects of management to be followed by REB as well as by the\nPBSs and other groups registered with REB.\n71. Currently, 67 PBSs serve about 1.5 million consumers and distribute about 26 percent of\nthe electricity consumed in the country. The responsibilities of a PBS begins when a distribution\nscheme  is  handed  over  to  it  for  O&M  after  construction  and  commissioning.  Its  principal\nobjective is to supply its members and other consumers with electricity. Its functions include (i)\ndistributing  electricity  and  providing  consumer  connections;  (ii)  meter  reading,  billing,  and\ncollection; (iii) purchasing electricity from BPDB and DESA; and (iv) planning and implementing\nthe expansion of local distribution systems with REB\u2019s financial and technical assistance to\nconsumers  for  wiring  their  premises,  acquiring  and  installing  electrical  appliances,  and\nimproving their power factors through the installation of capacitors.\nb.  Organizational Structure\n72. REB  is  managed  by  a  board  consisting  of  a  chairperson  and  four  full-time  board\nmembers (finance, engineering, administration, and PBSs and training). To coordinate the rural", "21\nelectrification program in their respective fields, four part-time board members, one each from\nBPDB,  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation,  Bangladesh  Small  and  Cottage\nIndustries Corporation, and Bangladesh Rural Development Board serve on the board.\n73. Each PBS is a member-owned autonomous cooperative, distributing electricity in its\nservice area. The initial board of directors of a PBS is selected from local citizens, subject to the\napproval of REB\u2019s board of directors. After their appointment, the directors register the PBS with\nREB, which then proceeds to encourage potential consumers to become members of the PBS.\nThe PBS board consists of 10-15 members elected in an annual members\u2019 meeting. Persons\nare  to become or remain a director if they are bona fide members of a PBS and residents of its\nservice area. Any person or organization in a PBSs area may become a member of the PBS\nfollowing acceptance by the board and payment of a membership application fee of Tk10. The\nboard elects a president who functions as its chief representative officer.\nc. Financial Performance\n74. The ultimate owners and operator of the REB-implemented component of the Project will\nbe the eight PBSs which are receiving assistance from the Project: Jessore-1, Jessore-2,\nBarisal-1, Barisal-2, Kushtia, Bagherhat, Faridpur and Meherpur. In order to assess the financial\nposition  and  performance  for  part  C,  the  financial  statements  for  the  eight  PBSs  were\nconsolidated and projections based on the consolidated position. A summary of the financial\nprojection and indicators for the eight involved PBSs are presented in Table 7. The detailed\nprojected financial statements and major assumptions used for the financial projections are in\nAppendix 7.\nTable 7: Summary of the Consolidated 8 PBS\u2019s Projected Financial Performance,\nFY2001-FY2008\n(Tk million)\nItem 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nNo. of Customers 391,276 410,840 427,273 440,092 484,101 629,331 818,130 981,756\nSales (MWh) 256,064 282,311 305,347 323,943 367,027 486,678 645,335 782,146\nTotal Revenue 894.6 1,026.5 1,156.8 1,279.7 1,509.0 2,075.1 2,858.8 3,609.6\nNet Profit (111.9) (146.8) (132.5) (97.7) (57.3) (96.6) 7.4 168.9\nTotal Assets 5,244.5 5,460.6 6,576.8 7,801.7 8,704.8 9,247.8 9,224.8 9,382.9\nCurrent Liabilities 759.1 805.6 823.1 829.1 865.3 1,025.3 1,092.7 1,179.7\nLong-Term Liabilities 4,344.3 4,561.1 5,472.8 6,452.9 7,138.9 7,489.4 7,391,7 7,293.9\nEquity 14.8 (32.3) 154.6 393.4 574.3 606.7 614.0 782.9\nOperating Margin (%) (1.8) (5.0) (3.3) (0.2) 2.5 (0.1) 4.7 8.3\nRate of Return on Total (0.4) (1.1) (0.7) (0.2) 0.3 (0.2) 1.2 2.9\n     Assets  (%)\nRate of Return on Average neg. neg. neg. neg. neg. neg. 1.2 24.2\n     Equity (%)\nCurrent Ratio 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.9\nEquity Ratio (%) 0.3 (0.6) 2.4 5.0 6.6 6.6 6.7 8.3\nDebt Service Coverage 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.3 1.9\n     Ratio (times)\nMWh = megawatt-hours, neg. = negative.", "22\n75. The PBSs have the authority to set retail tariffs except agriculture tariffs, which are\nestablished by the Government. PBS tariffs tend to be sufficient to cover all operating costs,\ndebt-service obligations with the expected increased energy load, an adequate return on equity\ncan be expected in the long run. The earnings of the PBSs are nontaxable and the PBSs do not\nbear foreign exchange risks. Surplus cash and reserves are invested in expansion and technical\nimprovement projects. In general, the PBSs already perform better than BPDB. Their system\nlosses, on the average, are about 18 percent, which will decrease to about 15 percent by\nFY2007.  Considering  the  investments  financed  by  the  Project,  the  expected  increase  in\ncustomers (590,000) and energy load (526 GWh) will be about 250 percent and 300 percent,\nrespectively, during the implementation period. In general, due to the lower load per invested\ntaka,  the  PBSs  have  a  weaker  financial  position  than  the  more  dense  urban  distribution\nnetworks. It will take 7-8 years until the PBSs reach reasonable return on equity and another 7\nyears to reach an adequate equity ratio of roughly 30 percent to bring them to a self-sustainable\nand independent status.\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n76. The Project has been classified in environment category B requiring a summary of the\ninitial environmental examination to be attached to this Report. From the information supplied by\nPGCB, there appears to be no deleterious environmental impact that cannot be mitigated.\nPGCB conducted an initial environmental examination of the 230 kV and 132 kV transmission\nlines and substations in part A of the Project, including an initial social assessment,. Other\nproject components have negligible impact on the environment. A summary of the Mission\u2019s\nenvironmental assessment is given in Appendix 8. The appendix also details the principles of\nland acquisition and routing of transmission lines that will be followed to minimize environmental\nand social impact, and the principles of compensation that will be applied to persons affected by\nthe Project.\n77. PGCB  will  acquire  about  23.6  hectares  for  the  new  230  kV  substations  at  Bogra,\nBaghabari, and Khulna, and the switching station at Serajganj. The identified sites, other than\nthose at Bogra, are low-lying and get flooded every year. Hence they support few permanent\npopulation  or  structures.  At  Baghabari  and  Khulna,  it  will  be  necessary  to  demolish  one\nhomestead and resettle the occupant families. At Bogra, though the land is good for agriculture\nand supports three crops a year, there are no permanent settlements or structures. For the\nswitching station at Serajganj, land developed by the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority will\nbe used and land acquisition will not be necessary. Few trees need cutting at all the identified\nsites. In addition to land for the substations, PGCB will also need to acquire right-of-way for the\ntransmission lines that will be constructed. The Mission observed that the transmission lines\nwere proposed to be routed through paddy fields where tree cutting is not necessary. The\ntemporary disruption of agriculture (during line construction only) can easily be mitigated.\n2.  Social Analysis\n78. ADB missions have discussed project components in detail with the management as well\nas the staff of BPDB and REB/PBSs who, in turn, have briefed their members. ADB missions\nhave  also  discussed  the  elements  of  the  Project  with  potential  beneficiaries,  such  as  the\nFederation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, several industrialists, as well as\na few residential and commercial consumers at Khulna. The beneficiaries are aware of the Project", "23\nand support the power sector reforms now being implemented.  The staff of the power sector\norganizations support the project, but some have reservations regarding the restructuring and\ncorporatization activities.\n79. The Project will not necessitate major relocation of persons. Only about 63 landowners\nwhose land will be acquired for the four substations may be permanently affected. A resettlement\nplan has been prepared based on ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (November 1995) and\nconsistent with laws, regulations, and practices of Bangladesh. Minor rerouting of the transmission\nlines, to be considered during project implementation, will further reduce the number of affected\npersons. ADB\u2019s review missions will closely monitor implementation of the plan for compensation\nand resettlement.\n3. Project Performance Monitoring\n80. Project performance monitoring will be done by BPDB, PGCB, and REB, and will be\nreviewed by ADB missions as part of the supervision work. This will include verifying of (i) the\nnumber of additional connections provided, (ii) the consumer categories of the new connections,\nand (iii) the improvements in service for the existing consumers in the project area. Institutional\nparameters such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and systems losses will also be\nevaluated.\nI.  Technical Assistance25\n81. The distribution operations of BPDB are organized into four zones:  central zone, east\nzone, west zone, and north zone. With a view to improving operating efficiencies of these zones\nas well as their consumer orientation, BPDB intends to reorganize its distribution systems in\nthese zones and introduce modern management systems. As part of this effort, BPDB wishes to\norganize each zone as a separate company, governed by its own board of directors, and\nmanaged  independently.  The  first  zone  to  be  corporatized  will  be  the  west  zone,  with  its\nheadquarters at Khulna. In this context the Government has requested ADB to provide TA to\nBPDB and the new company for west zone distribution to conduct studies necessary to effect\nthe corporatization of BPDB\u2019s western zone, as well as develop systems for efficient O&M.\n1.  Objectives and Scope\n82. The TA will assist the Government and BPDB to (i) corporatize BPDB\u2019s distribution in the\nwest zone, (ii) introduce modern management systems in the new company, (iii)  advise the\nnew  company  on  modernizing  and  upgrading  the  power  network  of  Khulna  City,  and  (iv)\nestablish quality assurance practices in the new company for its efficient operation. Outline\nterms of reference are in Appendix 9.\n2.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n83. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising $765,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $485,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance, on a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program, the full foreign exchange costs and $135,000\nequivalent of the local currency costs for a total of $900,000. The remaining $350,000 will be\nprovided  by  the  Government  and  BPDB  in  kind,  to  cover  costs  of  office  accommodation,\n                  \n25  This TA will be withdrawn if DFID provides support for a comprehensive organization development.", "24\ntransport, salaries of counterpart staff, administrative support, and contingencies. A detailed cost\nestimate is in Appendix 10.\n3.  Implementation Arrangements\n84. The TA will require about 22 person-months of input of an international consulting firm or\nutility with expertise in management systems, engineering, O&M of distribution systems, legal\ndrafting  of  power  purchase  agreements,  and  cost  accounting.  The  international  consulting\nservices will be supported by 20 person-months of domestic consultants in the areas of asset\nvaluation, computerization of information systems, human resources management (especially\nbeneficiary consultations), and legal aspects. The international consulting firm will be selected in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and will be responsible to ADB for\nthe total scope of the work. The consultant will be requested to submit a simplified technical\nproposal.\n \n85. BPDB and the new company for West Zone distribution will be the EAs for the TA. For\nsmooth implementation of the study and to facilitate transfer of knowledge, a task force with\nsuitably qualified and experienced staff and facilities will be set up before the consultants are\nfielded. BPDB and the new company will provide, free of charge to the consultant\u2019s team,\n(i) office accommodation and facilities,26 and (ii) transport within Bangladesh. BPDB and the\nnew company will assist the consultants in gathering data, preliminary analysis, and writing the\nreport. The entire work, including writing the report, will be done in Bangladesh, thus maximizing\ntransfer of knowledge to Bangladeshi managers, engineers, accountants, and other staff. The\nconsulting firm will make its own arrangements for personal computers and other facilities for\nproducing its reports.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Project Basis\n86. As part of its private power generation policy adopted in October 1996, the Government\nhas invited private sector investment to increase generation capacity in Bangladesh. Proposals\nhave been solicited for about 1,400 MW of generating capacity on a BOO basis. This capacity is\nexpected to be available within the next five years. In addition, 320 MW generation capacity is\nunder construction or commissioning in the public sector.\n87. Almost  all  incremental  base  load  generation  is  thus  expected  to  come  from  IPPs.\nConsequently, to allow evacuation of power from the new plants, complementary investments in\ntransmission and distribution facilities are required. The Project provides for these matching\nfacilities.  The  Project  also  provides  one  more  interconnection  to  the  east  zone,  improving\noptimization of generation sources. Appendix 11 presents the consumer connection summary,\nwhich was used as the basis for the financial and economic analyses of the Project.\nB.  Financial Analysis\n88. The financial evaluation of the Project (Appendix 12) was undertaken as three separate\nbusiness cases and in real terms using constant 2001 prices. Project cost estimates and\nfinancial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected\n                  \n26 Facilities, such as computer hardware, software and services for implementing financial management, billing and\nconsumer accounting systems will be purchased under the proposed ADB loan.", "25\neffects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and\nbenefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of the EAs under with- and without-\nProject scenarios.\n89. The  weighted  average  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  Part  A  (PGCB),\ncomputed on an after-tax basis, is 6.6 percent. This compares favorably with the weighted\naverage cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an after-tax basis, of 4.0 percent. Part A of\nthe Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates\nthat the weighted average FIRR is robust under adverse conditions.\n90. For Part B (the new company) financial analysis is based on input data provided by\nBPDB regarding the expected transfer of assets, customers, and load for the involved five cities.\nThe FIRR for part B, conservatively computed on an after-tax basis, is 10.0 percent, which\ncompares  favorably  with  the  WACC  of  2.8  percent,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.\nDecreased system losses beyond those assumed are expected to bring higher returns since the\naverage improvement assumed is from the current 26 percent to the projected 18 percent by\nFY2008.\n91. The weighted average FIRR for Part C (upgrade of eight PBSs), computed on an after-\ntax basis, is 5.9 percent. This slightly lower FIRR is, as earlier mentioned, caused by the lower\nload and less dense consumer base per invested amount in fixed assets. Still, it compares\nfavorably with the WACC, also computed on an after-tax basis, of less than 0 percent in real\nterms because of subsidized low interest rates from the Government to REB/PBSs.  The\ninvolved PBSs are expected to develop, financially as well as operationally, in a very positive\ndirection  as  a  result  of  this  Project  and  after  some  years  become  sustainable  and  viable\nindependent entities capable of financing their own expansion.\n92. The FIRR analysis is summarized in Table 8, and the WACC analysis is summarized in\nTable 9.\nTable 8: Summary of Financial Internal Rate of Return Analysis\n(percent)\nCase Part A Part B Part C\nBase Case 6.6 10.0 5.9\nRevenues Decrease by 10% 4.8 neg. 0.2\nOperating Expenses\n Increase by 10% 6.2 neg. 1.8\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun 4.3 7.2 3.2\nneg. = negative.\nTable 9: Summary of Weighted Average Cost of Capital Analysis\n(percent)\nCase Part A Part B Part C\nBase Case 3.96 2.84 <0\nOne-year Construction Delay\n with a 10% Cost Overrun 4.27 3.26 <0", "26\nC.  Economic Analysis\n1.  Economic Rationale for the Project\n93. The  greater  Dhaka  area  has  the  highest  commercial  and  political  importance  to\nBangladesh.  Thus,  infrastructure  and  other  investments  have  tended  to  focus  on  it.  As  a\nconsequence, the area has shown considerable improvement in its physical infrastructure, while\nother regions of the country, which have not been able to attract aid or private sector capital,\nhave been falling behind. However, increasing the connections in predominantly rural areas is\nnot feasible until the entire supply chain comprising the generation and transmission facilities is\naugmented. Bangladesh has made good progress in promoting private sector investment in\ngeneration  facilities  while  the  public  sector  has  continued  to  establish  transmission  and\ndistribution lines to help evacuate and utilize the privately generated power. This successful\nmodel will now be applied to west Bangladesh, a relatively poor area of the country, with a view\nto the correct existing imbalance of physical infrastructure, electrification rate, and overall social\nand economic development in the country.\n94. Studies in Bangladesh have shown the crucial contribution of the power sector to social\nand economic development and, ultimately, poverty reduction. Power is an essential ingredient\nfor increasing economic growth, for improving the quality of life of consumers, and for creating\nemployment opportunities, especially in the rural areas. Given that only about 20 percent of the\npopulation in Bangladesh has access to electricity, this means that the electrification program in\nthe smaller towns and villages should be accelerated to increase the population's access to\nelectricity and to reap the benefits offered by good quality power supply.\n95. The multiplier effect that the use of electricity can have on the local economy was\nemphasized by the findings of a USAID-funded comprehensive field study carried out in 1996 to\ninvestigate the economic and social impact of the rural electrification programs implemented\nthrough the PBS.27 A general finding of that study was that the creation of PBSs caused local\nmarkets to expand and gave rise to a new class of entrepreneurs. Since the launch of the\nprogram, 6,000 direct jobs have been created in PBSs and REB. Once the PBSs mature and\nthe industries became more established, use of local raw material also increased, thereby\nestablishing a support economy that helps local employment and increases cash income. This\nhas resulted in the creation of about 20,000 indirect jobs at various industries and shops, which\nhad  opened  in  response  to  the  demands  created  by  the  program.  The  establishment  of\nindustries as a result of electrification, their growth, and the creation of a support industry for\nindustrial  inputs  have  another  beneficial  aspect  on  the  local  economy  \u2013  the  gradual\ndevelopment of local demand markets.\n2.  Project Costs in Economic Prices\n96. The economic analysis was carried out at border price level using 2001 prices. To\nconvert financial capital costs to economic costs, taxes and duties were deducted. No price\ncontingencies are included in the base capital costs. However, the economic capital costs\ninclude  5  percent  physical  contingencies.  The  costs  have  been  separated  into  foreign\nexchange,  indirect  foreign  exchange,  and  local  currency  cost.  Local  costs  were  further\nseparated and specific conversion factors used for skilled and unskilled labor. The remaining\n                  \n27 A Socio-economic Impact Estimation of the Rural Electrification Program in Bangladesh carried out by NRECA\nInternational Ltd.", "27\nlocal costs were converted to border prices by applying a standard conversion factor. Annual\nmaintenance and operating costs were also calculated in economic prices as a percentage of\nthe total investment costs for each component. The cost of energy is valued at the LRMC\ngeneration level for IPP plants, since the Project will evacuate and utilize the incremental power\nproduced by the Baghabari and Bheramara IPP plants that are expected to become operational\nin 2004. Transmission and distribution losses included in the total amount of energy to be\nimported into the transmission system separately for BPDB and REB distribution investments.\nReduction in system losses is reflected progressively in the reduced need for energy import to\nserve the same level of consumption.\n3.  Project Benefits in Economic Prices\n97. The economic benefits of electricity consumption for each major consumer category\nwere calculated separately for BPDB and REB. Different proportions of consumer categories in\neach PBS were taken into account for the REB benefit calculation. Customers suffer from\nfluctuating voltage levels and general poor quality of supply.  In addition to improving the quality\nand quantity of supply, the Project will provide for new connections, in both the urban and the\nrural  areas.  It  is  expected  that  when  load  shedding  is  completely  eliminated  and  reliable\nelectricity  supply  is  created,  the  purchase  of  more  sensitive  electrical  appliances  like\nrefrigerators for domestic consumers or production equipment for industries will increase. The\neconomic benefits were calculated separately for the new consumers and the incremental\nconsumption of existing consumers due to reduced load shedding and improved quality of\nsupply. Consumption of new consumers was valued at replacement cost, that is the alternative\neconomic costs of other energy sources such as captive power plants for industrial users or\nkerosene lamps for the domestic segment. Incremental, or induced, consumption was valued at\nthe estimated average willingness to pay for electricity based on the weighted average of the\nalternative cost of providing similar energy-related services and the current electricity tariff for\neach consumer category. The evaluation is described in more detail in Appendix 13, which also\nprovides the results of the sensitivity analysis.\n98. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was estimated at\n19.3 percent. The EIRR was calculated for a 20-year period including a 5-year construction\nperiod,  corresponding  to  the  estimated  useful  life  of  the  Project.  No  residual  value  was\nconsidered.\n4.  Macroeconomic Effects\n99. The creation of new sector entities should instill discipline and financial viability into the\nsector. Presently, because of failure to manage utilities properly, system losses and accounts\nreceivable are excessive and drain the sector of about $80 million per year. This has meant that\nthe Government has been directly subsidizing the end users of electricity. In FY1995, Government\nloans of $345 million to BPDB were converted to equity. This meant that the Government had\nforegone the domestic mobilization of funds inherent in the onlending of development loans and\ngrants to the sector. In DESA, the Government\u2019s equity of $260 million has become almost\nworthless because of operational losses incurred since its creation in FY1992.\n100. Electricity tariff did not increase during September 1991-September 1996 thus the price to\nconsumers  was  reduced  in  real  terms  and  creating  further  strain  on  the  sector,  whereas\ndebt-service obligations, fuel prices, and operating costs had risen. ADB\u2019s Ninth Power Project\naddressed this issue by increasing the average retail tariffs by 14.93 percent effective September-\nDecember 1996 and introducing of a formula for automatic adjustment for variations in key input", "28\ncosts. The Dhaka Power Systems Upgrade Project and the Project will seek to further the\nfinancial consolidation of the sector by rationalizing the tariff regime to decrease subsidies to\nricher PBSs and reducing in the consumption slab for the \u201clifeline\u201d tariff. Efforts to remove the\ndrain on the national exchequer and improve public financial management are essential to aid in\nmacroeconomic  management,  which  is  one  of  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  good\ngovernance.28\n101. The Project is designed to bring electricity to west Bangladesh, especially the southwest\nregion. With the completion of the Rupsha and Paksey bridges now under construction with JBIC\nfunding, extension of the natural gas network to the region as part of ADB\u2019s next operation in the\ngas sector, and proximity to the Indian market, this region of Bangladesh could become the next\ngrowth center of the country if appropriate infrastructure facilities exist.\nD.  Social Dimensions\n102. The Project is designed to promote economic growth by increasing access to electricity\nsupply in urban and rural areas in southwestern Bangladesh. The Project will provide a reliable\npower supply that will improve the  chances for industrialization and thus provide employment\nopportunities. A reliable electricity supply will also enhance education, health, and security facilities\nthat exist in the area.\n103. Although the Project is essentially gender neutral, there are benefits that will be derived by\nwomen as a result of electricity supply; education, security, and more comfortable living. With the\nadvantage of better lighting, women can spend their spare time on education or other vocations.\nCommunity televisions in the villages can improve general knowledge on health, hygiene, and\nprevention of diseases. Street lighting will provide better security to women after dark.\n104. The domestic tariff structure incorporates a lifeline tariff of Tk2.00/kWh ($0.04) for the first\n300 kWh per month. This amount of energy is much higher than the electricity consumed for lighting\nand  by  one  or  two  fans,  which  is  considered  the  basic  minimum  for  electricity  consumption.\nTherefore, ADB has requested that this level be brought down to 50 kWh per month, which is the\nconsumption of a poor household. While increasing tariffs in the past, it was ensured that this lifeline\ntariff is affordable to the lower income groups. The Government is considering a proposal submitted\nby the Power Cell on this issue.\n105. No layoffs are envisaged as part of the Project, the overall reform process will, in the future,\nlead to surpluses in certain categories of staff in BPDB and DESA. Such staff can be retrained in\nother skills for redeployment in REB, DESCO, and BPDB's successor organizations. Staff who are\nnot employable in the sector will be given compensation packages for separation. The power sector\nagencies, in association with ADB and other aid agencies, will conduct studies next year and evolve\nan appropriate scheme to mitigate the social impact of the reforms.\nE.  Impact on Poverty\n106. The  Project  does  not  directly  address  poverty  reduction  because  the  primary\nbeneficiaries are largely the industrial, commercial, and domestic consumers, both rural and\nurban. This mix of consumers is important to safeguard the financial and economic viability of\nthe Project. However, the Project yields very attractive economic returns and with increasing\nemployment opportunities as a result of electrification, there will be benefits for the poor. Power\n                  \n28  R151-95: Governance: Sound Development Management.", "29\noutages affect the small businesses more than the larger ones - the small shopkeeper and the\nartisan, as well as the poorer residential consumers who cannot afford backup generators.\n107. Over the past three years, agriculture output in Bangladesh has considerably increased\ndue to one additional crop a year based on irrigation, using water from nearby rivers or shallow\ntube wells, drawn up using electric pumps. Without the spread of electricity, farmers would be\nforced to use diesel pumps, which are considerably more expensive to purchase and operate,\nand hence may not be an incentive for additional cropping. This increased agriculture activity\nhas  provided  more  employment  opportunities,  both  on  and  off  the  farm.  With  increasing\nelectrification,  agroprocessing  industries  are  also  slowly  developing,  providing  more\nemployment.\n108. A long-term research study on rural poverty,29 published in 1995, covered 62 villages\nrepresenting 57 of 64 districts in Bangladesh. One article compiled in the book analyzes the\ndeterminants of poverty and their relative significance. One of the six major factors identified,\nphysical infrastructure, was defined to comprise rural electrification, irrigation, and transport\nfacilities.\n109. The methodology compared electrified with nonelectrified villages. Poverty incidence\nwas estimated for electrified villages and was then compared with that of villages without access\nto  electricity.  Poverty  was  substantially  reduced  with  the  spread  of  electrification.  Only  14\npercent of the residents in electrified villages are hard-core-poor \u2013 defined as persons whose\naggregate expenditure falls below the normative poverty line of 2,112 calories per day plus a 30\npercent allowance for nonfood basic needs \u2013 as compared with 31 percent for villages without\nelectricity. The matched figure for moderate poverty is 27 percent and 31 percent respectively.\nThe researchers concluded that the extremely poor benefit more from rural electrification than\nthe moderately poor.\nF.  Risks\n110. The success of the Project depends on the maintenance of tariffs to ensure the financial\nviability  of  the  sector  and  its  entities.  The  FIRR  and  EIRR  of  the  Project  were  tested  for\nsensitivities and have been found robust. To further mitigate the risk, (i) covenants were proposed\nto ensure the financial viability of PGCB, Ashuganj Power Company, and the new west zone\ndistribution company, in the short term; and (ii) the legal framework for  the sector  is  being\nchanged and an independent regulatory authority is being established for the long term. ADB\ngranted TA to the new regulatory authority to support its operationalization (footnote 8).\n                  \n29 Rahman, H.Z. and M. Hossain eds. 1995.

General\n1. The Power Grid Corporation of Bangladesh Ltd. (PGCB) in part A is a limited-liability\ncompany incorporated under the Companies Act 1994. PGCB\u2019s primary role is to own and\noperate the country\u2019s transmission network and the National Load Dispatch Center. PGCB is in\nthe process of receiving assets and staff from the Bangladesh Power Development Board\n(BPDB), which is expected to be completed by September 2002.\n2. In part B, the new company that will be created for the five district towns in the western\nregion of Bangladesh, will start up with a \u201cclean\u201d balance sheet as an independent corporation\nunder the Companies Act, 1994. During the Project period, it will gradually take the over assets,\ncustomers database, and energy load from BPDB. Apart from this transfer, the Project will then\nprovide financial resources for further investment in an expanded grid that will secure a major\nincrease of new connected customers.\n3. Part C involves eight rural electric cooperatives or Palli Bidyut Samities (PBSs) that\nsurround the five district towns covered by Part B. These PBSs are operated locally as fully\nindependent cooperatives, but with extensive support from the government institution, the Rural\nElectrification Board (REB), regarding technical and financial management, procurement, and\ngeneral business control. To avoid uneven development between the urban and the rural areas,\nthe Project will provide similar resources to the eight PBSs, aiming for the same targets in\nachieving improved quality of supply and a major increase of new connected customers, as\nwell.\nB. Past Financial Performance\n4. PGCB was incorporated in 1996 as a public limited company with an authorized capital\nof Tk10 billion and the paid up capital by the end of FY1999\u20132000 was Tk938.72 million. During\nFY1999\u20132000 the company became partially operational, taking over some grid substations and\ntransmission lines from BPDB and already from the start earning a return on its investments.\nFrom the start the company had operational success as a result of the Power Sector Reform\nProgram initiated by the Government of Bangladesh. PGCB aims to become an efficient grid\nmanager by acquiring the whole existing transmission system of the country, by establishing a\nnew  National  Load  Dispatch  Center,  and  by  constructing  new  transmission  lines  and\nsubstations  commensurate  with  generation  growth.  For  the  first  operational  FY1999-2000,\nPGCB had a turnover of Tk172.6 million and a net profit before Tax of Tk39.7 million. (Further\ndetails are in the audited annual report for FY1999\u20132000 in a supplementary appendix.)\n5. For part B, BPDB will initially act as the Executing Agency (EA) but as soon as the new\ncompany is incorporated, and its first executive management appointed according to the loan\ncovenants, the newly created entity will be the actual EA for implementing the Project. The initial\noperation of the company will be based on assets, customer database, and energy load that\ngradually will be transferred from BPDB. As the available information regarding this specific\nportion of BPDB\u2019s operation has been very limited, it was not possible to present any complete\nhistorical  financial  performance  reports.  From  the  available  basic  information  \u2013  number  of\ncustomers, energy load, and losses \u2013 the focus has been on the financial analysis of the future\nprojection. The audited annual report of BPDB for FY1999-2000 is available as a supplementary\nappendix.", "51 Appendix 7, page 2\n6. REB will be the formal EA for part C being the supporting umbrella institution to the\noperational PBSs. As REB will be just administratively, and not financially affected by the\nproposed project, no further financial analysis have been carried out for this entity. The audited\nannual reports for the last years are available as supplementary appendixes. The consolidated\nfinancial historical data for the eight PBSs is presented in the projection for FY2000. Due to a\nless dense customer database and lower load, these rural PBSs show a weaker financial\nperformance. Despite a much more efficient operation in terms of general management and\nadministration and much lower losses than those of the urban distribution entities.\nC.  Financial Projections\n1.  General\n7. The effects of the proposed Project on the financial position of PGCB, the new west\nzone distribution company, and the eight PBSs have been reflected in the projected financial\nstatements.  Projections  were  prepared  on  a  nominal  basis,  based  on  major  assumptions\noutlined in the following paragraphs. The financial projections are in supplementary Appendix A.\n8. Domestic inflation rates were assumed to be 4.5 percent and international inflation rates\n2.4 percent throughout the projections from FY2001.\n2.  Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB)\na.  Income Statement\n9. PGCB\u2019s revenues are derived from transmission of electricity. Transfer of transmission\nassets from BPDB has been effected gradually since October 1999 and till September 2002.\nFor the purpose of the financial projections, it was assumed that the transmission tariff will be\ncomputed following a full-cost-recovery methodology. An operation and maintenance provision\nwas assumed at 1.5 percent on average fixed asset balance and increased in line with domestic\ninflation. In addition, depreciation, foreign exchange losses, and taxes were covered by the\ntariff. It was also assumed that a gross margin on average historical fixed assets of 10 percent\nconstitutes a reasonable return.\n10. It is assumed that PGCB\u2019s operating expenses will include repairs and maintenance,\nmaterials  and  equipment,  salaries  and  wages,  contract  labor,  and  administrative  charges.\nFinancial projections are based on actual historical figures and a budget prepared by the\ncompany. Local costs are projected to increase in line with domestic inflation. An average\ndepreciation rate of 3 percent per annum is charged, on a declining balance basis, against the\nhistorical  value  of  fixed  assets.  The  transferred  assets  from  BPDB  are  computed  to  be\ntransferred at historical net value after depreciation.\n11. Together with the earlier transfer of assets from BPDB, PGCB\u2019s current debt position\nwas analyzed, and from available information, an amortization schedule was prepared to project\nannual interest expenditure including existing as well as new loans. The company has assumed\na debt and an equity portion associated with assets transferred from BPDB. In addition, it will\nfinance future capital expansion through a combination of equity, domestic and international\ndebt, including supplier\u2019s credit. Interest expense for the project loan is computed on the basis\nof an ordinary capital resource (OCR) interest charge estimated at 4 percent per annum with a\nlocal mark-up of 1.5 percent per annum. Cofinancing by Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) of", "52 Appendix 7, page 3\nGermany and Nordic Development Fund (NDF) is computed at an interest rate of 0 percent and\na local markup of 5.5 percent.\n12. For PGCB, income tax is computed at 40 percent of gross profits.\nb.  Balance Sheet\n13. It is assumed that PGCB will maintain its accounts receivables to within two months of\nbilling.\n14. It is assumed that PGCB will maintain an inventory balance of approximately three\nmonths use of materials and spare parts.\n15. It is assumed that accounts payable will comprise one month\u2019s repairs and maintenance,\ncontract fees, procurement, and administrative charges.\n16. Capital  expenditures  are  based  on  the  ongoing  capital  expenditure  and  expansion\nprograms to 2006. Financing for the planned expenditures will be from domestic debt and\nequity, bilateral assistance, and supplier credit. For purposes of the financial projections, it is\nassumed that no further investment in capital assets will be made after 2006.\n17. PGCB\u2019s existing debt position was analyzed (para. 11) and from available information,\nan  amortization  schedule  was  prepared  to  project  annual  interest  expenditures,  foreign\nexchange losses and debt-service obligations. It is assumed that the project loan will have a\n5-year grace period (to coincide with the construction timetable) and a 15-year repayment\nperiod.\n18. It is assumed that PGCB\u2019s share capital will increase due to partial equity financing of\nassets transferred from BPDB to assure an initial accurate equity ratio of roughly 30 percent for\nthe company.\n19. It is assumed that if cash balance at the end of the year exceeds the coming year\u2019s\ndebt-service requirements, then up to 50 percent of the balance can be distributed as dividends.\n3. West Zone Electricity Distribution Company\na.  Income Statement\n20. It is assumed that the new company will gradually take over distribution assets and\ncustomer database from BPDB, starting with Khulna town by 2002. The remaining towns will\nfollow in 2003\u20132006 along with expansion investment from the Project that will be implemented\nduring  the  same  period  for  all  five  towns.  The  current  customer  database  is  expected  to\nincrease by 15 percent in 2004, and 30 percent annually in 2005\u20132007. The total increase will\nbe roughly 147,000-418,000 customers during the implementation period. The tariffs are based\non current tariffs increased by the Tk0.15 increase (approximately 5 percent) in line with the\ncovenant of this Project. The initial average tariff is computed at Tk3.106 per kilowatt-hour\n(kWh) and will increase with the local inflation rate. Aside from the increase in new connected\ncustomers and in tariffs, the sales are conservatively computed with no expected increase in\naverage consumption for all customer categories.", "53 Appendix 7, page 4\n21. It is assumed that the new company will continue to purchase its power supply from\nBPDB  at  current  price  plus  Tk0.08  as  its  share  of  the  expected  general  increase  in\nend-consumer tariffs. The purchase tariff will increase with local inflation as well. The initial\npurchase tariff is computed to be Tk1.99 per KWh. The amount of power purchased will be a\nfunction of consumer demand and system losses. According to BPDB\u2019s records, the current\ntechnical and nontechnical system losses, range from 25 percent to 35 percent for the involved\ntowns. These losses are expected to conservatively slowly decrease to almost the same level\nas for most of the PBSs, 18 percent compared with the PBSs 15 percent. These decreases in\nsystem  losses  will  raise  the  collection  ratio  from  today\u2019s  extremely  low  50  percent  to  the\nexpected 88 percent from 2010 onwards.\n22. Operating costs are computed based on the current actual costs provided by BPDB and\ninclude operation supervision, engineering, overhead lines and meters, customer installations,\nand  consumer  accounts  expenditures.  Financial  projections  are  based  on  actual  historical\nfigures from FY1999-2000 and are computed as a weighted average cost per kWh purchased,\nassuming these are fully variable costs. This weighted average cost will increase with the\ndomestic inflation rate.\n23. Distribution maintenance costs are based on current actual costs. For the financial\nprojection, these costs were computed at 1.5 percent of the ending book value of gross assets\nuntil the end of the construction period, and will increase with domestic inflation from 2007\nonward.\n24. Based on actual figures, the administrative and general expenditures including salaries\nand wages are assumed to increase with domestic inflation.\n25. The fixed assets are based on transfer of assets from BPDB at net book value after\ndepreciation as well as additional investments related to the Project. It was assumed that all\nassets will be depreciated on a declining balance basis at 3 percent per annum.\n26. The  company  has  assumed  a  30  percent  debt  and  a  70  percent  equity  portion\nassociated with assets transferred from BPDB to ensure a healthy equity ratio from the start.\nFuture  capital  expansion  will  be  financed  through  a  combination  of  equity,  domestic  and\ninternational debt, as well as supplier\u2019s credit. The interest charges are estimated at 4 percent\nper annum with a local markup of 1.5 percent per annum on foreign exchange loans. Interest on\ndomestic loans are computed at the rate of 5.5 percent per annum.\n27. For the new west zone distribution company, income tax is computed at 40 percent of\ngross profits.\nb.  Balance Sheet\n28. The current accounts receivable for the entire five regions of BPDB, which was the only\ninformation available as of June 2000, on average, represent roughly 14 months' sales. It is\nassumed that as the new company gain operational experience, it will be able to reduce this, on\naverage, to 3 months by 2004-2005, and then to 2 months by 2006-2010, and to 1.5 months by\n2011 onward. It is assumed that a provision for doubtful accounts will be maintained at 5\npercent of the total accounts receivable balance.", "54 Appendix 7, page 5\n29. It  is  assumed  that  the  new  distribution  company  will  maintain  a  stock  of  electrical\nmaterials  of  approximately  24  months  of  distribution  expenses  less  supervision  and  rent\ncharges.\n30. No specific information on accounts payable was available for the five towns. However,\nbased on actual figures for the entire BPDB, it is assumed that ending accounts payable will\nreflect  2  months  electricity  purchase  and  5  months  of  other  operating  expenses  less\ndepreciation.\n31. Capital expenditures are based on the transfer of assets from BPDB and from the\ninvestments related to the Project. Financing for the planned expenditures will be from domestic\ndebt and equity, bilateral assistance, and supplier credit. The financial projections, assumed that\nno  further  investment  in  capital  assets  will  be  made  after  2006.  A  debt  and  amortization\nschedule was prepared based on the terms for these specific loans to project annual interest\nexpenditures, foreign exchange losses, and debt-service obligations.\n32. It is assumed that the new distribution company\u2019s share capital due to partial equity\nfinancing of assets transferred from BPDB, will be created to assure an accurate initial equity\nratio of roughly 40-45 percent for the company.\n33. It is assumed that future surplus cash generated from the operation of the company will\nbe invested in further transfer of the remaining towns in the western zone of Bangladesh. No\ndividends were considered during the projection period for the company.\n3.  Rural Electricity Board/Palli Bidyut Samities\na.  Income Statement\n34. The projection is based on a consolidation of the eight involved PBSs. The current\ncustomer database is expected to increase by 10 percent in 2004, 30 percent annually in 2005\nand 2006 and by 20 percent in 2007. The total increase will be roughly 410,000-980,000\ncustomers  during  the  implementation  period.  The  tariffs  are  computed,  based  on  current\naverage tariffs depending on the customer category mix for the involved PBSs in the range of\nTk3.08-Tk3.52 per kWh, and will increase with the local inflation rate. Aside from the increase in\nnew connected customers and in tariffs, the sales are conservatively not computed with any\nexpected increase in average consumption for any of the customer categories.\n35. It is assumed that the PBSs will continue to purchase their power supply from BPDB and\npartially from the new west zone distribution company at the current price, which will increase\nwith local inflation as well. The initial purchase tariff is computed to be Tk2.16 per kWh in 2002.\nThe amount of power purchased will be a function of consumer demand and system losses.\nCurrent technical and nontechnical losses for the eight PBSs range from 9.4 percent to 17.7\npercent. On the average, these losses are expected to gradually decrease to 15 percent in\n2008, which is a marginal change to an already very good performance.\n36. Operating costs are computed based on the current actual costs for the eight PBSs and\ninclude  operation  supervision,  engineering,  overhead  lines  and  meters,  and  customer\ninstallations. Financial projections are based on actual historical figures from FY1999-2000 and\nare computed as a weighted average cost per kWh purchased (Tk0.092 per kWh in 2002),\nassuming these are fully variable costs. This weighted average cost will increase with domestic\ninflation.", "55 Appendix 7, page 6\n37. Distribution maintenance costs are based on the current actual costs (0.68 percent on\nfixed assets value in 2000). For the financial projection, these costs were computed to 0.75\npercent of the ending book value of gross assets until the end of the construction period and will\nincrease with domestic inflation from 2007 onward.\n38. Consumer  accounts  expenditures  comprising  supervision,  meter  reading,  customer\nrecords/collection, uncollectible accounts, and consumer assistance are based on actual costs.\nIt is assumed that these average costs will be based on weighted average cost per customer\n(assuming these are fully variable costs) and that they will increase with domestic inflation. The\naverage cost is computed to be Tk166.00 per customer in 2002.\n39. Based on actual figures, the administrative and general expenditures, including salaries\nand wages, are assumed to be approximately Tk60 million per annum in 2001 and will increase\nwith domestic inflation.\n40. It is assumed that all assets will be depreciated on a declining balance basis at 3 percent\nper annum.\n41. The current debt position of the eight PBSs was analyzed. From available information,\nan amortization schedule was prepared to project annual interest expenditure including existing\nas well as new loans. Interest expense for the Project is computed on the basis of ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources and the interest charges are estimated at 0.75 percent per annum\nduring an 8-year grace period and at 2.0 percent per annum during the remaining years. The\ndomestic loan is computed at the same interest rates as the international loan.\n42. Given their cooperative status, the PBSs are exempt from paying the corporate income\ntax.\nb.  Balance Sheet\n43. Accounts receivable for the eight PBSs, as of June 2000, ranged from 1.3 to 3.1 months.\nIt is assumed that they will be gradually reduced, on average from 2.5 months in 2002 to 2\nmonths in 2003-2006, and to 1.5 months in 2007 onward. It is assumed that the provision for\ndoubtful accounts will be maintained at 5 percent of the total accounts receivable balance.\n44. It is assumed that the PBSs on the average will maintain a stock of electrical materials of\napproximately 50 months of distribution expenses, less supervision and rent charges. This is a\nvery high and conservative assumption for an efficiently managed operation even if it is based\non the actual situation, and reflects partially the current difficulties in rapidly accessing reliable\nsupply of goods.\n45. Using historical data, the accounts payable are computed as 1 month of electricity\npurchases and 3 months of other operating expenditures.\n46. The PBSs existing debt position (para. 41) was analyzed and from available information,\nan amortization schedule was prepared to project annual interest expenditure and debt-service\nobligations.  It  is  assumed  that  the  loans  will  have  an  8-year-grace  period  and  a  24-year\nrepayment period. For the purposes of the financial projections, it is assumed that no further\ninvestment in capital assets will be made after 2006.", "56 Appendix 7, page 7\n47. The  PBSs  have  a  cooperative  ownership  structure.  Rather  than  share  capital,  a\nmember\u2019s equity is derived from the member\u2019s subscriptions. The entire project cost will be\npassed on from REB to the PBSs as a loan, denominated in taka, and with concessionaire\nterms; therefore, no increase in member equity is projected.\n48. No dividends for the PBSs were considered in the computations during the projection\nperiod.", "57 Appendix 8, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA. Description of the Environment\n1. The  proposed  230  kilovolt  (kV)  substation  sites  at  Bogra,  Khulna,  Ishwardi,  and\nBaghabari are paddy fields occupied by a 63 households, in houses, ranging from permanent\nbrick and cement structures to temporary corrugated sheet and mud structures. All sites except\nthose at Khulna and Bogra substations, get flooded during the monsoon and therefore do not\nsupport permanent settlements. At the Bogra site, there is no settlement on the land to be\nacquired. The routes leading to the substations are low-lying land and are flooded every year\nduring the rains. During the dry season, the area is cultivated with paddy crops.\n2. The 230 kV transmission lines that will be constructed as part of the Project pass\nthrough typical rural Bangladesh countryside, for a total length of about 450 kilometers (km).\nWhile most of the proposed routes pass through open agricultural fields, the lines will traverse\nsome river used for inland water navigation, and some clumps of trees beside some human\nsettlements. No forest areas are involved. It is estimated that about 35 households, will be\naffected.\nB. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n3. Possible impacts include damage to crops, cutting of trees, demolition of buildings, and\ndisplacement of persons. These impacts were assessed as not significant and can be mitigated\nby (i) minimizing such impact through careful routing of the transmission line, and (ii) paying\nadequate compensation. The number of persons affected will be reduced through a proper\ndelineation of the sites and their transmission line approaches, as well as by modifying the route\nalignments. Compensation will be paid to all those to be affected.\n4. The following guidelines for tower spotting will be observed:\n(i) The alignment will avoid, without exception, known wildlife reserves, closed (or\nold growth) forests, archaeological sites, religious structures, and educational\ninstitutions.\n(ii) As far as practicable, the alignment will avoid orchards and houses (permanent\nor temporary). In particularl, special care will be taken to avoid human settlement\nclusters.  Where  orchards  are  unavoidable,  the  ground  clearance  will  be\nincreased to at least 10 meters.\n(iii) Where road or river crossing is unavoidable, prescribed vertical and horizontal\nclearance requirements will be strictly adhered to.\n(iv) The proposed alignment will be submitted to at least the following authorities for\nreview:  Archaeological  Survey,  Wildlife  Conservation  Agency,  Inland  Water\nTransport  Authority,  and  Highways  Department.

Based on ADB\u2019s guidelines for land acquisition and resettlement, the following principles\nwere identified as applicable to the Project:\n(i) The  principal  objective  of  involuntary  settlement  policies  is  to  ensure  that\npopulations affected by the Project should be at least as well off, as they would\nbe without the Project, if not better off. Affected populations should be able to\nmaintain or preferably, improve their standard of living and quality of life.\n(ii) People affected by the Project are defined as those who, as a consequence of\nthe Project, stand to lose all or part of physical and nonphysical assets, including\nhomes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, tenancy, income-\nearning opportunities, social and cultural activities and relationships, and other\nlosses that may be identified during resettlement planning. A socioeconomic\nsurvey  to  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  resettlement  planning  process,  will\nrepresent  the  cutoff  date  for  compensation  eligibility  for  physical  assets  as\nidentified during the survey. Affected populations will be involved in the process\nof developing and implementing the resettlement plans through the process of\nthe socioeconomic survey. Affected populations will receive fair (market-based\nreplacement  cost)  compensation  for  all  losses,  including  physical  and\nnonphysical assets. Compensation will include not only immediate losses, but\nalso opportunities forgone. Affected populations that stand to lose only part of\ntheir physical assets will not be left with a proportion that will be inadequate to\nsustain their current standard of living, such a minimum size being identified and\nagreed upon during the resettlement planning process.\n(iii) All  affected  populations  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  mitigative\nmeasures, irrespective of tenurial status, social or economic standing, and any\nsuch factors that may discriminate against achieving the objectives mentioned\nabove.\n(iv) Involuntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by  identifying  possible  alternative\nproject designs; and appropriate social, economic, operational, and engineering\nsolutions  that  have  the  least  impact  on  populations  in  the  project  area.  A\nresettlement plan for the affected populations should identify among other things,\nthose  affected,  all  losses  that  might  be  incurred,  and  appropriate  mitigative\nmeasures. The plan should include detailed implementation schedules that are\nalso consistent with available and projected budgetary outlays and construction\nschedules.\n(v) Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and be made available to\ncover the cost of land acquisition within the agreed upon implementation period.\n(vi) Construction activities will not commence until the required lands have been fully\nacquired  and  populations  appropriately  relocated  in  accordance  with  the\nforegoing.", "59 Appendix 8, page 3\n(vii) Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified\nand  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement  management  system.  The\nresettlement process and the final outcome will be evaluated independent of the\nExecuting Agency.\nC. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n6. Since the impact is small, the environment monitoring program will be limited to the\ncompensation to be paid to affected persons. This will be done by the Power Grid Company of\nBangladesh, which will prepare summary reports every six months, to be verified by ADB\nmissions.\nD.  Resettlement Plan\n7.

The cost of ordinary capital resources debt was calculated based on an interest rate of\n4.0 percent per annum, a local markup of 1.5 percent per annum, and an income tax rate of 40\npercent per annum on part A and part B. Part C (PBSs) is computed with an income tax rate of\n0 percent per annum.\n5. For part B, the cost of Special Funds resources was calculated based on an interest rate\nof 4.0 percent per annum, a local markup of 1.5 percent per annum during the grace period and\nthereafter. For Part C, the cost of Special Funds resources was calculated based on an interest\nof 1.0 percent per annum, and with no markup during the grace period and thereafter with 1.5\npercent and 0.5 percent, respectively.\n6. On this basis, and using an average outstanding loan balance per annum over the life of\nthe loan, the cost of total foreign debt in real terms was computed to be 2.17 percent for part A,\n0.07 percent for part B, and negative for part C.\n7. The costs of the Government debt for parts A and B were calculated based on an\ninterest rate of 5.5 percent per annum, an income tax rate of 40 percent per annum, and an\naverage domestic inflation rate of 4.5 percent per annum. On this basis, and using an average\noutstanding loan balance per annum over the life of the loan, the cost of the Government debt in\nreal terms was computed to be 0.11 percent for part A and 0 percent for part B.\n8. The cost of the Government debt for part C was calculated based on an interest rate of\n0.75 percent per annum for the first 8 years and 2.0 percent for the remaining years, an average\ndomestic  inflation  rate  of  4.5  percent  per  annum.  On  this  basis,  and  using  an  average\noutstanding loan balance per annum over the life of the loan, the cost of the Government debt,\nin real terms was computed to be even negative.\n9. The opportunity of equity in Bangladesh, in real terms, was calculated on the basis of\ncurrent long-term savings rates (13 percent) adjusted by adding a risk premium of 3 percent per\nannum and taking into account an average domestic inflation rate of 4.5 percent per annum.", "68 Appendix 12, page 4\nThis interest rate is the same as the demanded rate of return for risk investments in the private\nsector.\n10. Based  on  the  above,  the  WACCs  were  estimated  to  be  3.96  percent  for  part  A,\n2.84 percent for part B, and negative for part C.\nC.  Conclusion\n11. The FIRR is expected to comfortably exceed the WACC for each project component\n(both computed on an after-tax basis). Given the overall objectives of the Project, the financial\nperformance is deemed acceptable.", "69 Appendix 13, page 1\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n1. An  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project\u2019s  transmission  and  distribution\ninvestments was undertaken. Details of the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)\ncalculations are in Table A13.1 and the sensitivity analysis are given in Table A13.2.\n2. The Project targets urban and particularly rural areas; therefore, the consumer\nsegments and their proportions differ for the Bangladesh Power Development Board\n(BPDB)  and  Rural  Electricity  Board  (REB)  investment  portions  and  are  calculated\nseparately. The major towns have only three major consumer segments: domestic,\ncommercial,  and  industrial.  For  the  REB  areas,  there  is  also  a  significantly  large\nagricultural consumer segment for which economic benefits were also calculated.\n3. Customers suffer from not only load shedding but also fluctuating voltage levels\nand generally poor quality of supply.  In addition to improving the quality and quantity of\nsupply, the Project will also provide for new connections, particularly under the REB\ninvestment  component  in  predominantly  rural  areas.  The  vast  majority  of  new\nconsumers will be added in the first three years after construction is completed; after\nthat the growth rate of new connections will drop back to the normal level of about 1\npercent. Benefits for the new customers were valued at their economic replacement\ncost, that is the alternative economic costs of other energy source such as captive\npower  plants  for  industrial  users  or  kerosene  lamps  for  domestic  consumers.  It  is\nexpected that when load shedding is completely eliminated and reliable electricity supply\nis created, there will be increased purchase of more sensitive electrical appliances like\nrefrigerators for domestic consumers or production equipment for industries.\n4. Induced consumption was valued by estimating the consumer\u2019s willingness to\npay for incremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer surplus benefits\nto  the  tariff-based  revenues.  For  reasons  of  convenience,  frequently,  the  relevant\ndemand  curve  segment  is  treated  as  linear  to  simplify  the  arithmetic  calculations.\nHowever, to reflect the demand price elasticity for the various categories of consumers,\nin this evaluation only a portion of the maximum consumer\u2019s surplus benefits is assumed\nfor the valuation of induced sales. This is arithmetically expressed by using different\ncurvature factors for different consumer categories, all of which are smaller than 0.5.\n5. Alternative sources of power used by the four major consumer segments were\ndetermined  and  their  respective  costs  were  estimated.  The  dominant  sources  of\nalternative power in the domestic sector are kerosene lamps and in the urban areas also\ninverter batteries. Private ownership of small diesel generators is very low throughout\nBangladesh and is found only among very high-income urban consumers and thus\ncannot be considered for estimating the willingness to pay. A large proportion of total\nend-consumption  in  the  domestic  sector  is  for  lighting  purposes  and  to  run  small\nappliances like TV sets, fan, and radio. During power cuts or in non-electrified areas,\nelectricity is substituted almost exclusively for lighting purposes. Therefore, consumption\nin the domestic sector was valued based on the use of kerosene lamps, using the\nwillingness-to-pay method plus the related consumer surplus with a curvature factor of\n0.3. Consumer surplus was estimated at Tk3.22/kilowatt-hour (kWh) for REB customers\nand at Tk2.82/kWh for BPDB consumers, reflecting the different tariffs levels of the two\ndistribution units.", "70 Appendix 13, page 2\n6. Inverter batteries are the alternative energy source in the commercial sector\nsince  it  can  be  used  to  operate  small  appliances  that  are  typically  used  in  small\ncommercial establishments, like fans, TV sets, and radios in addition to lighting purpose.\nSince the project area is generally less economically developed, use of small generators\nfor  commercial  establishments  is  unlikely,  given  the  high  up-front  capital  cost  of\npurchase and installation. The financial cost of using inverter batteries was estimated at\nTk5.9 per kWh. A curvature factor of 0.4 was used in the calculations.\n7. Inquiries made with BPDB and REB found that the industry sector in the project\narea  consists  mainly  of  smaller  industrial  establishments  that  have  not  invested\nsubstantially in captive power. According to the two utilities, the typical captive power\nfacility is a small diesel generator set of approximately 40 kilowatts. Textile mills would\nbe the user of this type of generator.  The financial cost of such a generator was\nestimated to be Tk5.5/kWh and as for the commercial segment, a curvature factor of 0.4\nwas used.\n8. For the purposes of the economic analysis, the estimated capital costs of the\ntransmission  and  distribution  components  were  broken  down  into  direct  foreign\nexchange items, indirect foreign exchange, and local goods and services. All costs\nelements were valued in border prices, using a domestic currency numeraire, with all\ntaxes and duties excluded, a standard conversion factor of 0.855 being applied to\nnontraded items, and a labor conversion factor of 0.8 being used for unskilled labor and\n1.1 for skilled labor. Operating costs were calculated as a fixed percentage of economic\ninvestment cost, using 1 percent for the transmission component and 5 percent for the\ndistribution investments. Operating costs are building up gradually until the construction\nperiod is completed.\n9. The  economic  benefits  of  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  required  to\nevacuate power from new generation projects, such as the proposed independent power\nproducers (IPPs), are difficult to determine independently. Transmission and distribution\nare integral parts of the total power system development plan and not independent\ninvestments. The EIRR on the complete investment required in new generation projects\nplus associated transmission and distribution are normally considered as representative\nof the rate of return on transmission and distribution investments, as they are typically\nonly a part of the total investment.\n10. Therefore,  the  economic  evaluations  of  transmission  and  distribution\ncomponents include economic send-out costs of power.  The Project aims specifically to\nconstruct transmission and distribution facilities needed to evacuate power from newly\nproposed IPP projects for which no financial closure has been arrived at yet and thus, no\ntakeoff prices are available. Power input costs are valued at the long-run marginal cost\n(LRMC) generation level for IPP plants that have already reached financial closure at\n$0.375/kWh.\n11. On the basis of a comparison of economic costs and benefits over a 20-year\nproject lifetime, including a five-year construction period, the EIRR was estimated at\n19.30 percent with a net present value (NPV) of Tk6,495 million.  Extensive sensitivity\ntesting was carried out and found that the Project is robust for all of the tested variables.\n12. Sensitivity testing found a comfortable switching value for increases in capital\ncosts of 59 percent, and of 24 percent for increase in energy input prices. Testing for", "71 Appendix 13, page 3\nchanges  in  curvature  factors  for  the  different  consumer  categories  as  well  as  for\nchanges of fuel input prices for selected captive generation did
