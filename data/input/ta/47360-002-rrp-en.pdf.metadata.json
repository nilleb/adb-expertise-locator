THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement \nProject. \n \n2.  The proposed project will rehabilitate 214 kilometers (km) of provincial roads in the \nprovince of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, pilot two performance-based maintenance (PBM) contracts \ncovering 104 km of provincial roads, and enhance road asset management.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country  context.  Pakistan  is the fifth most  populous  country  in  the world  with  an \nestimated population of 207 million people, and the most urbanized country in South Asia. \nPakistan shares borders with Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Iran. Due \nto its strategic location, it has great potential to become a regional transport and logistics hub \nproviding the People\u2019s Republic of China and the landlocked Central Asian countries with access \nto the Arabian Sea. Pakistan\u2019s economy is among the better performers in South Asia with an \nestimated gross domestic product growth rate of 5.3% in FY2017, a substantial increase from \n4.5% in FY20162. Pakistan\u2019s economy is largely driven by strong growth in domestic consumption, \nrecovery in agricultural production, and a marginal recovery in foreign direct investments; but is \nconstrained by an inefficient transport system with poor levels of service. \n \n4.  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa:  a  vulnerable  and  underperforming  economy.  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa, which is located in northwest Pakistan, is geographically the smallest of the \ncountry\u2019s four provinces; however, it ranks third in terms of both population (about 30 million\u2014\n16% of the country\u2019s population) and economic production (accounting for 10.5% of Pakistan's \neconomy). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s economy is dominated by forestry (about 61% of the national \nforestry output); mining (20% of national output); agriculture (its main cash crops include wheat, \nmaize, tobacco, rice, sugar beets, and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables); and some \nmanufacturing.  These  economic  activities  require  a  reliable  transport  system  and  efficient \nconnectivity to lower transport costs and improve competitiveness. \n \n5.  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Afghanistan to the northwest, and is adjacent \nto the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the west. The province has faced severe crises due \nto militant activity, particularly during 2007\u20132009 along the Afghan border. The conflict intensified \nthe vulnerability of the region, which is already one of Pakistan\u2019s poorest and most disaster-prone, \nsubject to catastrophic floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \nlags other provinces across a wide range of social and economic indicators (this lag is even more \npronounced when viewed in terms of gender). The militants destroyed local livelihoods, caused \nlarge-scale  displacement,  damaged  infrastructure,  and  worsened  the  region\u2019s  business \nconnectivity with the rest of the country. Since 2012, the security situation has improved due to \nongoing military operations by the Pakistan Army. \n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  transaction  technical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement Project (TA 9194-PAK). \n2   ADB. 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017 Update: Sustaining Development Through Public-Private Partnership. \nManila. \n ", "2 \n6.  Need for improved connectivity. Pakistan\u2019s transport sector contributes about 10% to \nits gross domestic product and accounts for over 6% of employment in the country.3 Road \ntransport dominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in \nton-km and 92% of passenger traffic in passenger-km. Dependence on road transport is even \nhigher  in  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa.  The  province  also  provides  the  main  transit  corridor  to \nAfghanistan across the Khyber Pass. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s classified paved road network of \n15,102 km includes 1,878 km of national highways managed by the National Highway Authority, \n1,824 km of provincial highways4 managed by the Pakhtunkhwa Highways Authority (PKHA), and \n11,400 km of district roads managed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Communication and Works \nDepartment. Provincial highways connect district centers with the national highway network, and \nplay a vital role in the province\u2019s economic development. With average daily traffic counts at \naround 3,000\u20138,000 vehicles, provincial highways also connect provincial administrative and \ncommercial centers with district headquarters and market towns. They are vital in facilitating intra-\nprovincial trade and commerce; providing access to health, education, and other public services; \nand reducing poverty by creating jobs and business opportunities. \n \n7.  Deteriorated  road  conditions.  Road  surface  conditions  and  riding  quality  are \ndeteriorating due to ageing infrastructure and poor asset management. Inadequate drainage is a \nmajor cause of premature road failure. The pavement condition of more than half of the road \nnetwork is rated poor or bad, according to road condition data surveyed in 2013. A significant \nmaintenance backlog exists, with about 700 km of provincial roads having a pavement condition \nindex (PCI) of less than 2;5 at least one-third of this backlog requires reconstruction, while the \nremaining sections need major rehabilitation. Low technical standards and inadequate safety \nfeatures have contributed to road safety hazards, especially at intersections near built-up areas. \nRehabilitation interventions focused on road links in poor to bad condition will help reduce the \nmaintenance backlog, ease the maintenance financial burden, and improve the overall condition \nand safety of the provincial road network. \n \n8.  Overloading challenges. Overloading, a common challenge in Pakistan, is a serious \nproblem in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to logging, quarrying, and mining traffic, especially in the \nprovince\u2019s marble-producing areas. Although light vehicles account for 80%\u201390% of traffic in \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa, a 2013 traffic survey revealed that over 95% of trucks in all categories were \noverloaded, some as high as 100% above permissible load limits. Road in the center region of \nthe province carry the heaviest traffic while the southern region has the lowest traffic. Overloading \nreduces pavement design life and results in premature deterioration, often leading to catastrophic \nfailure. The PKHA has established two stationary weighbridges, and is investing in mobile vehicle \nweighing equipment; however, controlling overloading requires a multifaceted approach, such as \nregulatory overhaul, self-regulation by the trucking industry, selective enforcement with modern \ntechnology, vehicle taxation to encourage the replacement of rigid single axles with multi-axle \nconfigurations, overloading control at the source, and the use of stronger pavements based on \nactual axle loads. The project design acknowledges the actual axle load spectrum, and the PKHA \nhas begun enforcing overloading control measures at the source, such as at marble mines and \nfactories. \n \n                                                \n3  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms. 2014. Pakistan 2025: One Nation, One \nVision. Islamabad. www.pc.gov.pk. \n4  Excluding 380 km of provincial highways located in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. \n5  PCI is an indicator of pavement performance for asphaltic roads that ranges between 0 (extremely poor) and 7 (newly \nconstructed and distress-free).  \n ", "3 \n9.  Road asset management. The PKHA established a road asset management system \n(RAMS) assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)6 with a dedicated RAMS directorate \nwithin the PKHA. A basic database, including road inventory data and condition data, was \nestablished with a Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4) interface. A falling \nweight deflectometer and profilometer were provided, and have been used to survey pavement \nconditions and collect data.7  An annual maintenance plan for FY2014\u2013FY2015 was prepared \nwith the assistance of a consultant utilizing the RAMS. The assessment showed that the existing \nRAMS should be enhanced with both hardware and software using the latest technology, an \nembedded  geographic  information  system,  and  staff  training.  The  RAMS  should  also  be \nexpanded to cover bridges and large drainage structures, road safety and traffic management \ninfrastructure, and geotechnical infrastructure such as slope retaining structures, embankments, \nand tunnels. The PKHA will provide a dedicated annual budget allocation for data collection and \noperation expenditure of the RAMS. \n \n10.  Sustainable road maintenance. Road maintenance sustainability has been a challenge \nin Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Annual budget allocations for road maintenance and preservation have \nbeen insufficient to operate and maintain the road system at an acceptable service level. Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Communication and Works Department, including the PKHA, receives about 2.0%\u2013\n2.5% of the province\u2019s annual budget for the road sector, on average, but most of this allocation \nis spent on new road and bridge construction and upgrading works (especially during 2014\u20132017). \nExpenditure on road repairs and maintenance accounted for over 10% of total spending on roads \nin 2014\u20132015, but this fell to 8% in 2015\u20132016, and is expected to fall to around 6% in 2016\u2013\n2017.8 The PKHA established a Road Maintenance Fund with financing from the provincial \nbudget allocation (98%) and revenues generated from road tolls and leasing of property within \nrights-of-way (2%). The government is also promoting public\u2013private partnerships in the road \nsector to improve the efficiency of road investment and maintenance under long-term, build-\noperate-transfer arrangements. The project will expand toll roads, increase tolling revenue, and \nhelp the PKHA increase its maintenance budget allocation. \n \n11.  Performance-based  maintenance.  Routine  and  periodic  maintenance  is  currently \ncarried out in small road sections about 100\u2013200 meters long, resulting in an uneven road surface \nfull of patches that disintegrate with the movement of traffic. Maintenance (mostly focused on \nemergency repairs) is carried out by small contractors through contracts bid annually. The budget \nallocation for routine maintenance cannot be guaranteed; thus, large sections of the road network \ndo not receive regular systematic maintenance based on sound asset management practice. PBM \nis a relatively new approach designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of road \nmaintenance. It changes the role of a contractor from that of executor to road asset manager, and \nthe contractor is paid on the basis of outputs or predefined service levels instead of inputs. PBM \nfocuses on incentives to encourage good performance and sustainable results under a multi-year \nmaintenance  contract.  The  project  includes  a  PBM  component  to  be  financed  by  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa to pilot two 5-year PBM contracts covering about 104 km of provincial roads that \nare still in fair to good condition. This will be the first time that PBM has been piloted in Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa. These PBM contracts are intended to maintain high road serviceability, while \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n7 A falling  weight  deflectometer is a  testing  device used by civil  engineers to evaluate  the  physical  properties \nof pavement.  Profilometer is  a measuring  instrument used  to  measure  pavement 's  profile,  in  order \nto quantify its roughness. \n8  During 2016\u20132017, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa released an additional $85 million for the construction of the Swat \nExpressway, leading to an approximately 250% increase in the PKHA\u2019s budget for new works compared with  \n2015\u20132016. \n ", "4 \nensuring the durability of all road infrastructure elements: pavements, shoulders, slopes, drainage \nstructures, and road safety furniture. Based on the pilot results, PBM will be replicated to cover \nthe entire provincial road network. This PBM experience could provide a road maintenance \ncontracting model to be applied in other jurisdictions. \n \n12.  Previous lessons and experience. The project design incorporated the main lessons \nfrom previous projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including a previous ADB-financed road project \n(footnote 6) and other road projects in the province financed by development partners such as \nthe  World  Bank  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  that  mainly  focus  on  flood \nemergency assistance. The subprojects were selected based on both the highest economic \ninternal rate of return, and security conditions (all are located in central and eastern Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa where security conditions are better and well-controlled). Advance procurement for \ncivil works and consultant recruitment were synchronized with project preparation to minimize \nstart-up  delays.  The  civil  works  contracts  are  packaged  to  accommodate  the  capacity  of \ninternational and local bidders. The government agreed to allocate a dedicated fund in its annual \nbudget for upgrading, data collection, and operation of the RAMS. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s assistance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s transport \nsector has not only improved regional connectivity within the province, but also strengthened the \nPKHA\u2019s capacity on the RAMS, overloading control, and road safety improvement. With ADB\u2019s \nprevious assistance, the PKHA established a road maintenance unit to operate the RAMS and \nprocured portable weighbridges to control overloading. ADB will continue the policy dialogue with \nthe government on increasing road maintenance expenditure with a mandatory budget allocation; \nmodernizing and enhancing the RAMS with the latest technology (both hardware and software), \ntraining, and technical support; and improving maintenance efficiency by piloting PBM contracts. \nThe PBM contracts are expected to establish a successful case that can be replicated and scaled \nup in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other provinces. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The project\u2019s impact will be an efficient and integrated transport network in Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa established (footnote 3). The project\u2019s outcome will be efficiency and safety along \nkey sections of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s provincial road network improved.9 \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  Output 1: Provincial roads rehabilitated.  The project will rehabilitate eight road sections \nwith a total length of 214 km to relevant provincial highway standards, while improving road safety \nand  providing  climate  resilience  features  to  withstand  damage  and  disruption from  natural \ndisasters (e.g., floods, landslides, and slope erosion). \n \n16.  Output 2: The Pakhtunkhwa Highways Authority\u2019s institutional capacity on road \nmaintenance strengthened. The PKHA\u2019s capacity will be strengthened through pilot PBM \ncontracts, enhancement of the RAMS, the provision of maintenance equipment and laboratory \nequipment, and training. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $164 million (Table 1). \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The provincial government will be the executing agency, and the PKHA will be the \nimplementing agency. The PKHA will undertake the actual project implementation. The PKHA \nhas established a functional project implementation unit (PIU) with the formal appointment of a \nfull-time project director and other key staff; and the government has agreed that PIU staffing will \nremain stable throughout project implementation. Any replacement of key staff will be subject to \nADB\u2019s prior approval. The provincial government will be responsible for causing the PKHA to \ncomply with its obligations in relation to the project. \n \n21.  Advance contracting for the road rehabilitation civil works and the recruitment of the \nconstruction supervision consultant have already begun. The government has been advised that \napproval of advance contracting will not constitute a commitment from ADB to finance the project \nuntil the loan and project agreements are signed and made effective.

Eight road sections were selected based on the outcomes of the PKHA\u2019s 2013 RAMS \ndata; two design consultant firms engaged by the PKHA conducted the detailed design; and the \nADB team reviewed and verified the design considering traffic volume, road conditions, and the \nPKHA\u2019s priority. Preliminary screening rated the project as being at medium risk of climate change \nimpacts,  primarily  flooding  risks.  A  further  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  was \nundertaken during project preparation, and the rehabilitation strategy focuses on improving \npavement  structure,  including  drainage,  slope  stability,  and  safety  enhancements.  All  road \nsections will follow existing alignments, with some sections widened to standard, 7.3-meter, two-\nlane carriageways, with shoulders of varied width per design standards (except for one road, \nwhere the existing four-lane pavement will be rehabilitated). The proposed pavement design \naligned with the results of the condition survey and falling weight deflectometer data, while taking \nthe reuse and recycling of the existing pavement into consideration. The project team also \nsurveyed the road sections using the International Road Assessment Program methodology11, \nand found that some road sections have a low (one- or two-star) rating with significant safety \nhazards, especially at junctions and built-up areas. The design will incorporate the recommended \nsafety measures to improve these high-risk sections to a three-star rating or better. The detailed \ndesign addressed climate change impacts by improving drainage facilities, stabilizing slopes with \nbio-engineering measures to minimize erosion, and ensuring the height of embankments with \ndesign flood frequency. \n \n                                                \n11 International Road Assessment Program methodology is to inspect high-risk roads and develop Star Ratings and \nSafer Roads Investment Plans to help countries make road safe. \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic. The economic analysis confirms that the project is economically viable, with \nan economic internal rate of return of 15.6%, and a net present value of $98.0 million at a 9% \ndiscount  rate.  The  project\u2019s  economic  benefits  comprise  reduced  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance costs for the road agency, and vehicle operating cost and travel time savings for \nusers. Economic viability is robust against increases in capital costs, as well as reductions in \nbenefits. A review of the PKHA\u2019s financial position indicates that the province should be able to \nallocate sufficient funds for road maintenance to ensure that these assets can be sustained. \n \n24.  Financial. The project will reduce the 30% rehabilitation backlog, which currently takes \nup 80% of the rehabilitation and maintenance budget, by rehabilitating road sections with a \nminimal residual life, thereby reducing future reconstruction and maintenance costs. In FY2016, \nthe  PKHA  had  a  resource  envelope  of  about  PRs903  million  for  the  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of provincial highways, versus an unconstrained need of about PRs3,298 million. \nOf this, 80% was required to eliminate the maintenance backlog by rehabilitating 700 km of \nprovincial roads in the worst condition. If this maintenance backlog can be eliminated or largely \nreduced, the road network will be stabilized with no more than 5%\u20137% of the network requiring \nstrengthening or rehabilitation each year, and the current budget envelope of about PRs903 \nmillion should be sufficient for routine and functional periodic maintenance of provincial highways. \nTolling is being considered on four project roads with higher commercial traffic volumes before \nrehabilitation works are completed. Additional revenue from these tolls is expected to contribute \nfurther to the maintenance budget and the project\u2019s sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The PKHA was assessed as having sufficient capacity to manage procurement, financial \nmanagement,  and  project  implementation  functions,  including  maintaining  the  accounting \nsystems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. The PKHA\u2019s financial management pre-\nmitigation risk is substantial, and an action plan is highlighted in the Financial Management \nsection of the PAM. The PKHA is experienced in the procurement and recruitment of consultants, \nas  mandated  by  the  provincial  government  to  plan  and  implement  the  development  and \nmaintenance  of  provincial  roads,  and  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment procedures. Further training on strengthening the grievance redress mechanism, \nprocurement,  accountability,  and  contract  management  will  be  conducted  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PKHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Consultations with local communities were held during field visits to the road sections. An \nanalysis of key stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of and concerns about the project shows positive \nfeedback and no major social impacts. The main direct project beneficiaries will be agricultural \ntraders, freight forwarders, transporters, commuters, and those living and working along the \nproject road sections. Indirect beneficiaries include large sections of the population who will gain \nincreased employment opportunities in trade and transport business as well as ready access to \nmarkets  and  resources  in  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa.  Local  populations  will  gain  employment \nopportunities  during  the  construction  and  operation  project  stages.  The  project  has  been \ncategorized as \u201csome gender elements,\u201d as it will benefit women by improving access to basic \n ", "9 \nsocial services such as health, education, and social networking facilities. Road safety features \nwill reduce accidents and fatalities. Key gender actions will include (i) consultations with separate \nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s groups to mitigate any negative project impacts; (ii) the rehabilitation of 20% \nof road sections with gender-sensitive design features (such as pedestrian sidewalks, rest areas \nfor families, and bus stops for women, children, and the elderly); (iii) capacity building of the PKHA \nin  social  safeguards  and  gender-sensitive  planning  and the  implementation  of  road  sector \nprojects; and (iv) the provision of additional assistance to households headed by women as part \nof the resettlement plan. \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  Environment (category B). The PKHA prepared a consolidated initial environmental \nexamination, including an environmental management plan (EMP), in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The potential environmental impacts are largely related to \nthe construction stage, and are temporary and site-specific. These include soil erosion and water \ncontamination, noise, vibration, air pollution, the felling of roadside trees, traffic disruptions, and \nimpacts pertaining to occupational and community health and safety. During operation, the project \nwill have potential impacts related to increased noise and air pollution levels, and community \nsafety. Adequate mitigation measures were designed and will be implemented through the EMP. \nAs the PKHA\u2019s environmental safeguard capacity is limited, the EMP will include capacity building \nand training of PIU personnel in environmental management. An environment specialist under \nthe construction supervision consultant will support the PIU in ensuring that the project complies \nwith the environmental requirements of ADB and the local government. Two series of public \nconsultations were conducted in the project area in March\u2013April and June\u2013July 2017. The initial \nenvironmental examination and EMP were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 September 2017. \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No land acquisition is required for the project \nbecause  improvement works  will  be  limited  to  existing  rights-of-way  owned  by  the  PKHA.  \nThe rehabilitation design of some road sections whose carriageways are of less-than-required \nwidth have been modified by reducing the proposed construction limit to the existing carriageway, \nalong with other technical solutions (e.g., traffic calming measures) to avoid impacting structures \nwithin the rights-of-way. A due diligence report was prepared to verify how the designs had been \nmodified  to  avoid  all  potential  impacts  on  structures.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework (LARF) was prepared to guide the PKHA in addressing any unforeseen land impact \nthat may arise during implementation due to contractor negligence or any unanticipated change \nin the road cross-sections. The LARF has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  and  it  has  been  agreed  that  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented in the event of unforeseen impacts. The due diligence report and LARF were \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 25 September 2017 and will be closely monitored by the PIU \nduring construction. \n30.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  does  not  trigger  requirements  on \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement because no distinct ethnic minority \ncommunities are present in any of the project areas. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n31.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.12 \n \n                                                \n12 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe Government of Khyber  The Asian Development Bank will maintain policy dialogue with \nPakhtunkhwa\u2019s insufficient budget  the provincial government to increase its annual budget for road \nfor the road sector and unbalanced  maintenance.
