The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  a  project  to  improve  water  resources  management  and \nirrigation. Management approved concept clearance for this TA on 7 September 2007. A fact-\nfinding mission visited Uzbekistan from 16 September to 3 October 2007 to prepare the TA in \ncooperation with the Government. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Agricultural  Economy.  Agriculture  accounts  for  29%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct, a quarter of its export earnings, and a third of national employment. About 60% of the \npopulation and a majority of the poor live in rural areas, where livelihoods are either directly or \nindirectly dependent on agriculture. The sector employs 33% of the population (see Appendix 2 for \nthe Initial Social and Poverty Assessment) and, as under the Soviet rule, it is dominated by cotton, \nof which Uzbekistan is the world\u2019s sixth largest producer. Self-sufficiency in wheat, a strategic \npriority after independence, was achieved in 1997. The Government continues to mandate wheat \nand  cotton  production  quotas,  provide  production  inputs,  and  purchase  outputs  using  prices \ndetermined by the state. Nevertheless, the state and world prices for cotton have become much \ncloser over the last few years, benefiting farmers. The current cropping pattern, however, places \ntremendous strain on land resources. \n \n3.  All of Uzbekistan\u2019s shirkat farms have been parceled out and leased long-term to private \nfarmers, many of whom have limited agricultural experience. This is a fundamental production \nchange\u2014from large holdings, managed collectively, to much smaller plots, individually operated. \nThese reforms represent significant progress in the sector but help is needed to improve the tenure \nstatus of farmers, thus spurring investment, and to provide extension services. The number of \ndekhan farms has increased significantly in the last five years to over 4.3 million plots in 2004, and \nthey produce most of the fruits and vegetables, and nearly 20% of grains. These farms are \nextremely productive, provide valuable rural income, and contribute to the country\u2019s food security. \n \n4.  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Needs.  Improving  water  management  and  increasing  the \nefficiency and productivity of water use are national objectives in Uzbekistan, where the climate is \ncontinental and arid conditions exist in more than 60% of the nation\u2019s territory. With rainfall limited \nto between 70 and 100 millimeters (mm) a year, agriculture is highly dependent on irrigation. \nIrrigated land provides about 90% of agricultural production. Under the Soviet Union, land under \nirrigation expanded from about 2.5 million hectares (ha) in the 1950s to 4.3 million ha in 1985\u2014\n2.35 million ha in the Amu Darya River Basin, and 1.95 million ha in the Syr Darya River Basin. \nIrrigation consumes 85% of all water resources. Uzbekistan\u2019s vast irrigation infrastructure includes: \n(i) 30,000 kilometers (km) of main and inter-farm canals and 33,000 hydraulic structures; (ii) more \nthan 1,500 pumping facilities, with almost 5,000 pumps that supply irrigation water to over 2 million \nha; (iii) 175,000 km of on-farm canals and conveyance structures; (iv) 40,000 km of on-farm \nhorizontal drains and 4,300 vertical drains; (v) 120,000 km of drainage ditches; and (vi) 15,000 km \nof large drainage collectors. \n \n5.  Although this infrastructure was well built during the time of the former Soviet Union, it has \ndeteriorated since independence. The state\u2019s share in agricultural investment has declined sharply, \nfrom 27% in 1991 to 8% in 2001, and state investment in the water sector is only a fifth of what it \nonce was. Deferred capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditures now amount to \nabout 40% of asset value. Some major irrigation structures could fail, and the system needs \nsubstantial rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U), including: (i) the reconstruction of 32% of the main \nand  inter-farm  canals, and  repair of  24%;  (ii)  the  rebuilding  of  42%  of  the  on-farm  irrigation \nnetwork, and repairs for 17%; (iii) the replacement and modernization of the mechanical equipment \n                                                 \n1 The technical assistance first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 October 2007. \n ", "2 \nof 18 of the 42 large intake structures, approximately 10 to 300 cubic meters per second (m3/sec), \nand reconstruction of five; and (iv) R&U of inter-farm drainage systems, in addition to the on-farm \nsystems, only 50% of which are operational. New modalities for sustainable O&M are also required \nto prevent further deterioration and to ensure that investment returns follow system R&U. \n \n6.  Pumped irrigation poses special challenges. The pumps in Uzbekistan are all operating \nbeyond  their  design  life  and  have  been  inadequately  maintained  for  two  decades.  Without \nintervention, many are likely to fail soon. Of the 76 very large pumping facilities with capacities of \nmore than 100 m3/sec, 60 require immediate rehabilitation.2 In addition, 400 of the 1,000 smaller \npumped  systems,  with  capacities  less  than  10  m3/sec,  need  immediate  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement. They are operated by both the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \nand water users associations (WUAs), and are used widely to extend command areas. Pumped \nirrigation accounts for 70% of MAWR\u2019s annual O&M budget and consumes 20% of Uzbekistan\u2019s \nelectricity. Significant opportunities exist to increase the efficiency of smaller pumped extension \nsystems  through  new  pump  technology,  more  demand-responsive  operating  regimes,  and \nimproved irrigation equipment. Sustainable O&M options must also be developed for pumps. \n \n7.  In addition to infrastructure R&U, the irrigation systems need improved water monitoring, \nmeasurement, and management. Substantial potential exists to improve water use efficiency by \nupgrading existing structures and controls through new operational procedures, automation, and \nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. MAWR has already seen positive \nbenefits from these measures in the Fergana Valley and Samarkand under programs of the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Swiss Development Corporation. \n \n8.  Current irrigation and water resources management practices result in low productivity. \nAverage water withdrawal per ha is 14,000 m3, compared with 9,000 to 10,000 m3 in countries with \nsimilar climates. Irrigation efficiency is only about 40%. The result is wasted water, overloaded \ndrainage systems, and worsening land mineralization. MAWR estimates that more than 20,000 ha \nof land goes out of production each year due to salinity caused by poor water management and \ninadequate drainage. The salinity affects cotton yields, which decline 20\u201330% on slightly salinized \nland, and up to 80% on highly salinized land. Some degree of salinization and waterlogging affects \n47% of all irrigated land.3 Productivity in irrigated agriculture dropped by 15% in the immediate \npost-Soviet era but has now recovered slightly. Yields are still low, however, with an average of \n2.25 tons per ha for cotton and 4.2 tons per ha for wheat. \n \n9.  Institutions. MAWR was established in 1996 to oversee agriculture and water resources \npolicy  and  manage  overall  development  of  the  sectors.  In  2003,  10  basin  irrigation  system \nassociations (BISAs) were created under MAWR to manage main and inter-farm irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure based on the hydraulic boundaries of the irrigation systems. The BISAs are \nsupposed to monitor and manage water resources, ensure effective water service delivery, and \nimplement policy at the basin level. Although creation of the BISAs was a step forward in water \nmanagement  practice,  and  BISAs  have  a  legacy  of  Soviet  engineering  expertise,  they  need \nexposure to advanced irrigation and water management methods to help them carry out their \nfunctions  more  effectively.  WUAs  have  been  created  to  replace  the  former  shirkat  irrigation \nmanagement system at the on-farm level. The WUAs are important institutions for reform and \nimproved service delivery, but they need (i) more training and resources during establishment and \nuntil they are sustainable, (ii) a strong legal foundation and mandate, and (iii) a review of their \n                                                 \n2 The pump cascades include Amu Bukhara, Karshi and Amu Zhang, and the latter is being rehabilitated through ADB. \n2003.

Manila. The other \ntwo large cascades also need urgent rehabilitation. However, parts of both systems are located in Turkmenistan, and a \nprevious attempt by the World Bank failed to secure an adequate agreement and access for the R&U of the Karshi \npumping cascade. \n3 ADB is addressing this situation through ADB. 2006.

Manila, that includes Uzbekistan. \n ", "  3\nresponsibilities  and  authority  within  a  broader  institutional  analysis  of  irrigation  management. \nUSAID and the Swiss Development Corporation have provided some training and support for \nWUAs, and the Government is working on laws to support WUAs, but no consistent national \napproach or program has been developed for their assistance. \n \n10.  Strategy Development. Three programs are under way in Uzbekistan to help develop \nstrategy and policies for water resources and irrigated agriculture, including two activities under the \nMinistry of Economy. ADB is supporting the TA, Implementation and Monitoring of Policy Reforms \nin the Agriculture Sector;4 and World Bank has just started the Water Sector Investment Planning \nStudy.  MAWR  is  preparing  its  own  water  conservation  strategy.5  These  efforts  are  vital  for \nsustainable  sector  development,  but  additional  coordinated  ADB  input  is  needed.  It  is  also \nimportant that this work on strategy receive continuing support and investment to bring about its \neffective implementation. For successful ADB engagement in the sector, a long-term strategy, \npolicy road map, and investment plan should be developed. \n \n11.  External Support. ADB is providing assistance to water resources and irrigated agriculture \nthrough  several  loans:  (i)  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project;  (ii)  Grain  Productivity \nImprovement Project; (iii) Amu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project;6 and (iv) Land Improvement \nProject.7 This assistance provides a mix of interventions, including R&U for very large inter-farm \nand small on-farm infrastructure, improved management and institutional strengthening, capacity \ndevelopment, and sector reforms. World Bank assistance is supporting infrastructure R&U as well \nas policy reforms. Given the overwhelming needs, a variety of approaches that blend different \nlevels of infrastructure R&U and sector reforms is warranted. Addressing pumps extension systems \nand  inter-farm  structures  diversifies  ADB  interventions  and  is  strongly  supported  by  the \nGovernment. Further ADB engagement, however, would benefit from a review of lessons learned \nfrom implementing previous projects. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be improved water resources management. The outcome will be \nan ADB sector project design that includes preparation of (i) a sector strategy to guide a long-term \nADB program for water resources and irrigated agriculture, and (ii) a sector investment project for \nADB financing. \n \n13.  The TA will prepare a sector investment project for water resources management and \nirrigated agriculture that includes (i) a sector strategy, road map, and investment plan; (ii) criteria to \nselect  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project;  (iii)  feasibility-level  technical  preparation \n(excepting detailed designs), with economic, financial, social, and environmental assessments of \nrepresentative core subprojects and their impacts, and analysis of the proposed Project as a \nwhole; (iv) an initial list of prioritized investments based on the selection criteria and preparation of \nthe  core  subprojects;  (v)  detailed  implementation  arrangements,  including  methodologies  and \nmodalities  for  subproject  selection  and  preparation,  project  management,  procurement,  and \nfinancial management, inter alia; (vi) a project investment and financing plan with financial flows \nand requisite cost-recovery mechanisms; (vii) institutional and policy analyses consistent with ADB \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will have two phases that overlap. Phase I will review, synthesize, and elaborate \nexisting sector work to provide analysis of water resource and irrigation issues, and develop a \nlong-term national strategy that includes an investment plan, a policy road map, and capacity \ndevelopment plan to guide ADB engagement. This TA work will be conducted in close cooperation \nwith the Government and development partners to contribute to ongoing sector work, and to \nensure a consistent and complementary approach. Phase I will define the geographic location for \nthe TA and develop criteria for selecting core subprojects. Consultations and at least one workshop \nwill be conducted to ensure consensus. Phase II will prepare a sector investment project based on \ncore subprojects, and on other requirements for ADB sector lending, and provide implementation \nrecommendations based on lessons from previous projects.8 Phase II will prepare the following \ncore subprojects.9 \n \n15.  Improved  Water  Management  for  the  Inter-Farm  System.  The  TA  will  prepare \nrecommendations to improve monitoring, measurement, and management of water resources in \nthe  main  and  inter-farm  systems,  including  (i)  the  improvement  of  structures,  (ii)  the  use  of \nmanagement information systems (MIS), (iii) an increase in automation, and (iv) application of \nSCADA technology on appropriate structures in appropriate systems. One objective is to match \nwater supply and demand more efficiently, thus saving water and reducing water deficits. The TA \nwill prepare core subprojects that provide R&U of priority water control structures, and that involve \nconstruction of new structures to manage water more effectively. The structures will include those \nat risk of failure, or whose water management function has been compromised. New structures \nwould  provide  cost-effective  benefits  for  improved  water  management,  including  facilities  to \naugment supplies in areas that lack water. The TA will evaluate current institutional arrangements, \nO&M procedures, and the capacity for irrigation and water management under the BISAs and \nrelated agencies. It will recommend improved management procedures, sustainable O&M options, \nstrengthened institutional arrangements, and required changes and capacity enhancements to take \nadvantage of MIS, SCADA and improved management systems. \n \n16.  Improved Water Management for Pumped Extension Systems. The TA will prepare \nrecommendations for replacement and R&U of pumped irrigation facilities for smaller extension \nsystems\u2014those with capacities of about 1 to 10 m3/sec. It will not include the large cascade \npumps.  It  will  examine  all  system  options,  including  improving  intakes,  pumps,  pipelines, \nelectronics and controls. The TA will emphasize new pump technologies and controls that yield \nwater and energy savings. Options to match water supply with demand more closely for improved \nefficiency will be explored, since pump systems offer more operational flexibility than large gravity \nsystems. The TA will develop policy recommendations and a strategy to address replacement and \nR&U of existing pumped systems, improved  management options, and sustainable O&M.  An \nimportant goal is to develop options, and methodologies that the Government can use throughout \nthe sector in its own activities or in cooperation with other development partners.  \n \n17.  Improved  Water  Management  for  Conveyance,  Application,  and  Drainage  of \nImproved Supplies. To optimize project benefits, the TA will examine the facilities for conveyance, \n                                                 \n8 The TA is designed so that its outputs will also satisfy the requirements for ADB\u2019s multitranche financing facility (MFF), \nwhich may be used. The lending modality will be determined in consultation with the Government during the TA.  \n9 The TA will support final loan processing, and to the Government for project readiness, including feasibility study, \nproject management training, consultant recruitment, and preparation of the project administration memorandum. \n ", "  5\nirrigation application, and drainage, now in place downstream of the inter-farm structures and pipe \nextension systems that are to be improved. It will prepare options and recommendations for better \non-farm water distribution and drainage with emphasis on low costs options.10 New irrigation \ntechnologies  that  result  in  greater  productivity  and  water  savings,  especially  with  pumped \nextension systems, will be evaluated and recommendations prepared. To support more efficient \nmanagement of the downstream facilities, the TA will provide options to increase the management \ncapacity  and  effectiveness  of  the  WUAs,  including  training,  improved  water  monitoring  and \nmeasurement, and MIS. The TA will produce a menu of hardware and software interventions that \ncan be implemented downstream to optimize subproject benefits. It will also review experience and \nmake recommendations regarding the Project\u2019s agricultural extension needs. The degree to which \nthese activities will be adopted and financed under the Project will be determined during the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.44 million. The Government will \ncontribute a local currency cost equivalent of $240,000. Details of the cost estimates and financing are \nin Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinancing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MAWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A TA steering committee chaired by the \ndeputy  minister  of  MAWR,  with  representation  from  the  ministries  of  economy,  environment, \nfinance, and from local authorities and other concerned stakeholders will be formed to review TA \nprogress and outputs, and meet as required. To ensure timely and effective TA implementation, \nMAWR will establish a TA project management unit with adequate counterpart staff in Tashkent \nand in the field under a qualified project director. MAWR will provide the following TA support: (i) \nadequate office space in Tashkent and in the field for the TA team; (ii) adequate access to \ntelephone, heating, electricity, and water; (iii) logistical support; (iv) access to data and feasibility \nstudies; and (v) facilitation of workshops. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months from the fielding of consultants, which is \nanticipated in March 2008. Phase I and phase II, with the completion of the draft final report, are \nexpected to be completed over 7 months. Over the subsequent 13 months, the TA will support \nconsultants for (i) loan processing missions, and (ii) project readiness activities on behalf of the \nGovernment. ADB will recruit a team of consultants through a firm using a simplified technical \nproposal  and  quality-and-cost-based  selection  procedures\u2014  weighting:  80%  quality  and  20% \ncost\u2014to provide 31.5 international and 85.0 national person-months of consulting services in water \nresources management and irrigation engineering, economics, agriculture, environment, social \nanalysis, resettlement, and institutional analysis. The TORs for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \nUp to 10 individual consultants of various disciplines may be recruited, as needed, throughout the \nTA. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and any procurement under this TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Uzbekistan for \npreparing the Water Resources Management Sector Project.  \n                                                 \n10  Uzbek farmers are responsible for financing 100% of on-farm improvements. Comprehensive R&U programs such as \nAk Altin are expensive and beyond the ability of farmers to pay, which is a constraint and Government concern. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved water  Water use productivity  Monitoring by the Ministry of  \u2022  Water resources continue \nmanagement in  improved by 10%  Agriculture and Water  to be a high priority for the \nUzbekistan     Resources (MAWR), the  Government. \n  Water consumption  basin irrigation system   \nreduced  association (BISA), and water  Risk \n  users associations (WUAs)   \n  \u2022  Transboundary water \nAgricultural statistics from  issues frustrate water \nMAWR  management efforts. \n   \nProject reporting \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nA strategy for Asian  Preparation of an ADB  ADB technical assistance  \u2022  The Government is a willing \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)  strategy, road map, and  (TA) review and loan  and capable partner in \nengagement of the water  investment plan for water  processing missions  strategy development. \nresources and irrigation  resources and irrigated    \u2022  The Government supports \nsectors, including  agriculture, and a  TA consultant and project  the project concept. \ninvestment, and  memorandum of  management unit (PMU)   \npreparation of a sector  understanding for a sector  reporting  Risk \nproject/loan  project/loan signed by the     \n  Government  Uzbekistan resident mission  \u2022  The Government is not able \nreporting  to reach internal consensus \non strategy. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nIn 2007, 25.8% of the people in Uzbekistan were living below the poverty line.1  About one third of the poor, or 2.3 million \npeople, were classified as extremely poor. About 70% of the poor live in rural areas. In 2001, the poverty rate in rural areas \nof Uzbekistan was 30.5%, versus 22.5% in urban areas. It declined in 2002 to 27.8%, but rose slightly in 2003 to 29%. The \noverall poverty rate dropped to 26.1% in 2004, and 25.8% in 2007. \n \nThe highest concentrations of poor households are in the northern region and in the south, where the poverty rate is almost \nfour times higher  that of Tashkent, which boasts the lowest percentage of poor in the country.2 The distribution of poverty \nreflects the different regional levels of development. The gap between the most and the least developed regions increased \nfrom 2.1 to 4.2 times in the 1991\u20132003 period. Poverty in Uzbekistan also has demographic features. Families with many \nchildren and with low labor-force participation rates are often poor.3 In 2005, the percentage of the adult population\u2014\nwomen from 16 to 54 years old, and men from 16 to 59\u2014employed in the administrative districts was 55% in Andijan \noblast, 53.3% in Namangan oblast, and 53.6% in Fergana oblast. The risk of poverty remains high in small towns where \npeople have more limited access to land resources than in rural areas. \n \nPoverty in Uzbekistan is linked to a lack of water in sufficient quantity and quality for normal domestic and irrigation uses. \nInsufficient access to water for productive uses prevents poor people from fulfilling their basic income needs. The country\u2019s \nirrigation systems are in bad condition, and some regions face water scarcity. In many areas, potable water is used for \nirrigating homestead plots, in addition to drinking, and sanitary and hygienic purposes. Rural people often use small water \nreservoirs to support agricultural needs during the growing season but this causes waterlogging, because of the rise of \ngroundwater, and damages the land\u2019s fertility. According to a survey conducted in the Fergana Valley, all the fruit trees \ndried up in areas with shallow ground water and intensive waterlogging of the land. Only 25% of the land in the valley is not \nsubject to erosion, and only one third of drainage wells are in operation. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2. The proposed project will be a targeted intervention based on the sector approach to subproject selection in that the \nbenefits will accrue to those persons in the subprojects areas. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  The TA will support a general poverty analysis of the rural sector, focusing on the project area once it is determined. In \naddition, the TA will support a detailed social and poverty analysis of all persons in the core subproject areas. This will \ncomprise a review of secondary sources, as well as primary data collection, including development of the study methodology \nand instruments, recruitment of a field team, and management of the field studies in the core subproject areas. A national \nsocial assessment specialist will be engaged for 4 months to carry out this work, and funds are available to hire field staff for \nsurvey work.  The social assessment specialist will coordinate with the economists to conduct the poverty impact assessment \nand the detailed stakeholder analysis in all core subproject areas. There will be an international economist for 6 months and \nnational economist for 7 months. Based on the experience from the TA, the social assessment specialist will develop terms of \nreference for detailed social assessment methodology, procedures, and a component to be included in the Project for \nanalysis of subprojects.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1   World Bank.  2003.

Household Budget Survey. Washington, DC. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nIncreasing crop productivity, improving the irrigation network, and reclaiming land all contribute to the development of the \nagricultural sector. Many private farms, dekhan farms and private entrepreneurs that engaged in viticulture and horticulture \nhave recently lost profits because land productivity has been reduced by salinity and waterlogging of the soil and the high \nsalinity of irrigated water. The limited natural grazing lands and lack of productive fodder hinder intensive development of \ncattle breading. The productivity of land in the southern regions is gradually decreasing due to rising groundwater, which \naffects the irrigation systems and causes a decline in crop yields. Orchards are drying up, and local people are losing their \nmain source of livelihood; 36% of an average rural household\u2019s income comes from its garden. \n \nIn some places, irrigation water from rivers and canals is being used for drinking and other domestic purposes. Although \npeople traditionally boil water before drinking, many rural families have limited access to gas and electricity and must try to \ncook and to sterilize the water using cheaper fuels like dry dung, or dried plants. Under these circumstances women and \nchildren run a high risk from water born diseases, with the most common being diarrhea, dysentery, gastrointestinal and \nkidney diseases, and hepatitis. Women and girls also have more limited access to hygiene and sanitary facilities than men \nand boys, who can use rivers and canals. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe primary stakeholders for the TA and ensuing project will be: (i) farmers in subproject areas; (ii) other residents in the \nsubproject area, who will benefit indirectly from improved productivity through demand for labor or additional expendable \nincome; (iii) MAWR and local BISA staff; (iv) WUAs; (v) ministries of economy and finance; (vi) local governments, and \nmahallas, self-governance bodies; and (vii) development partners. Consultation  will include  workshops, semi-structure \ninterviews,  surveys,  and  focus  groups  in  the  field.  This  will  be  done  by  the  PMU,  TA  consultants,  and  recruited \nnongovernment organizations and/or other organizations as required. \n \n1.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n2.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes         No  \nC.  Gender and Development \nThe nation-wide reform process in the agriculture sector of Uzbekistan has reorganized large, loss-making cooperative \nenterprises into smaller private farms. That, in turn, reduced public sector employment. While men and women constitute \nalmost equal parts of the labor surplus that occurred after shirkats were reorganized, women face greater difficulty finding \nnew employment. In the agricultural sector, men perform largely skilled and mechanized work while women do mostly low-\nskilled manual work. With the transition to contract-based labor, they have been pushed out of full time employment and \nhave only seasonal work opportunities. Meanwhile, the burden of unpaid housework on women at home and in household \nplots has increased. The result is a decline in the social status of women. Even those women officially employed in \nagriculture perform labor-intensive, low-paid types of work, such as picking cotton, dairying and breeding silkworms. The \nload put on women by unpaid work is particularly heavy in rural areas, where families are notably bigger than in towns and \ncities. This gap in family sizes gap is in fact, expanding. Rural women are responsible for farming household plots and care \nof household livestock. The available data suggests that women represent only 4.8% of private farmers, with the highest \nrate in the Khorezm region (13.1%) and the lowest (1.3%) in Surkhandarya. Only 6% of farm and water management \npositions are occupied by women. This implies that women are being excluded from key employment opportunities in the \nrestructuring process, as well as from positions of authority that could help empower them in local communities. \n \nThe main gender issues in water management sector include: different opportunities for women and men in access to, and \ncontrol over, water resources, costs, and benefits of production; lack of qualifications and knowledge among women in water \nresources management issues; and insufficient involvement by women in decision making, particularly within water users \nassociations. The number of women farmers is too low and their leadership potential is not used. These women become \ninvolved effectively participate in water management institutions at the scheme level and the basin level. \n \n1.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No \n \nThe TA will more fully evaluate the role of women in water resources management and irrigated agriculture to identify \npossible intervention points through the ensuing project. Possible project interventions could come through developing means \nto  enhance  women\u2019s  roles  in  water  users  associations  and  other water management organizations. Programs  could  be \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \ndeveloped to meet the training needs for female irrigators.  Employment opportunities through the project interventions could \nbe targeted or enhanced for women. A gender action plan will be developed under the TA. \n \n2. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?        \n          Yes          No  \n \nThis will be confirmed during the TA and if the possibility for adverse impacts on women and/or girls is identified, the \nprevention and any required mitigation measures will be developed. \n \nIII.
