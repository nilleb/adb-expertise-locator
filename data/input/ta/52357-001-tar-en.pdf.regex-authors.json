INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Phase 3 of the technical assistance (TA) for Pacific Economic Management will build on \nthe efforts of phases 1 and 2 of  the TA to improve economic analysis and monitoring in \nparticipating developing member countries (DMCs).1 The TA will strengthen the capacity for \npublic  sector  management  and  economic  policy  formulation,  including  for  public  financial \nmanagement, in Pacific DMCs. Stronger economic management will also help Pacific DMCs \nbetter anticipate, plan for, and respond to economic shocks. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational \npriority  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  particularly  in  small  island \ndeveloping states.2 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will support public management reforms to help \nDMCs create an enabling environment for sustainable growth. Strategy 2030 recognizes the need \nfor a differentiated approach toward small island developing states because of their vulnerability \nto economic shocks and severe institutional capacity constraints. The TA is in line with the \nimplementation priorities of the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020,3 which aims to manage risks \nthrough better economic management and public financial management. The TA was included in \nthe regional operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for the Pacific.4 The TA concept paper was \napproved on 25 January 2019.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s 14 Pacific DMCs are generally characterized by weak policy and institutional \nenvironments as highlighted in ADB\u2019s country performance assessments.6 Long-term growth \nrates are low and economies are susceptible to external shocks, which further threaten the \nsustainability of growth. Economic information and analysis needed to formulate sound policies \nto manage macroeconomic risks are often lacking. Inadequate capacity to plan and budget for \ncore infrastructure can lead to weaknesses in basic service delivery. Despite significant reform \nefforts supported by externally funded policy analyses and advice, many Pacific DMCs continue \nto struggle to implement policies that sustain higher economic growth, strengthen service delivery, \nand improve resilience to risks. \n \n4.  Better economic information and policy advice can enable governments to make more \ninformed policy decisions. High-level officials from economic agencies of the Pacific DMCs have \nrequested ADB for assistance to strengthen policy-oriented economic analyses. Phase 1 of the \nTA, implemented during 2009\u20132014, responded to challenges that Pacific countries faced in their \nefforts to improve economic monitoring and to formulate and implement policy in response to the \nglobal financial and economic crisis. The TA was rated highly successful.7 As the global economy \nstabilized,  phase  2  of  the  TA,  implemented  during  2013\u20132019,  shifted  its  focus  from \nmacroeconomic stabilization toward issues related to real sector reform to spur growth in the \nPacific. The TA continued to support Pacific DMCs in building their analytical capacity, including \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nthe provision of timely economic monitoring based on an enhanced set of indicators and the \ndevelopment of planning and forecasting models.8 \n \n5.  Pacific economies have garnered significant benefits from policy and institutional reform \nadvice and improved economic modeling under the earlier phases of the TA.9 Development of \nsimple fiscal management models and associated capacity building of technical staff in selected \nPacific DMCs (e.g., the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, the Marshall \nIslands, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu) have improved the ability of policy makers to \nassess long-term implications of budget decisions. Economic analyses and policy advice for \nPacific DMCs have covered topics such as debt policy and management, taxation, state-owned \nenterprise  reforms,  industrial  policy,  and  support  for  the  most  vulnerable  members  of  the \ncommunity. The earlier phases of the TA have helped inform the design of policy-based lending \nin Pacific DMCs such as the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Economic  Monitor  series\u2014a  semiannual  publication  that  began  in \nphase 1\u2014has become a leading platform for discussing economic developments and topical \npolicy issues in the Pacific. Issues of the Monitor are consistently among the most downloaded \npublications of the Pacific Department (PARD), and in quarters when they are released, are \ngenerally among ADB\u2019s most downloaded publications. Issues typically generate media articles \nand often include contributions from other development partners, academic institutions, and \nresearch  organizations\u2014facilitating  informal  knowledge  partnerships.  The  Pacific  Economic \nMonitor has evolved from focusing largely on budget analyses and outcomes to addressing topical \nsubjects such as climate change, debt sustainability, fisheries revenue management, high-value \nniche exports, and economic integration. \n \n7.  Despite success under the previous phases, capacity constraints in economic analysis \nand policy making remain a key concern needing to be addressed through further support, \nparticularly in smaller DMCs where there is a shortage and high turnover of technically qualified \neconomic staff. TA is also required to undertake analytical work to sustain growth and enhance \nresilience in the Pacific. ADB\u2019s engagement in the Pacific through policy-based operations often \nrequires technical support (coordinated with development partners) to lay the groundwork for \npolicy actions and preserve reform momentum. Therefore, sustained effort is needed to build \ncapacity and promote constructive policy making and institutional change in Pacific DMCs. \nAssistance to improve economic management must be tailored to meet individual circumstances \nand develop local capacity. The TA design reflects lessons from previous phases, including the \nimportance of ready access to policy advice when needed and the value to be gained from \nknowledge sharing among Pacific DMCs. \n \n8.  The Pacific Economic Monitor series should continue to serve as a forum for discussing \ntopical policy matters in the Pacific and for disseminating economic data for the 14 Pacific DMCs. \nExperience from its regular publication since 2009 (25 issues through December 2018) has shown \nthat readers\u2014from government, academia, and development partners\u2014find value in the series\u2019 \ncompilation and analysis of firsthand information to supplement the evidence base in this data-\nscarce region. Development partners have also indicated that they find the Pacific Economic \nMonitor useful as a basis for discussing policy priorities and gaining insight into regional economic \nchallenges. \n                                                \n8  Phase 2, which is considered to have delivered on its key outputs, is scheduled to close on 31 March 2019. The \ncompletion report will be prepared after closing.  \n9  The average country performance assessment score for economic management in Pacific DMCs has improved from \n3.0 in 2009 (when phase 1 was launched) to 3.1 in 2018. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  economic  and  fiscal  sustainability  in \nparticipating DMCs strengthened. The TA will have the following outcome: institutional capacity \nfor economic management in participating DMCs improved.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Economic and public financial management policy advice provided. To \nimprove institutional capacity, the TA will support DMC officials and economic advisors through \ntargeted training and regional knowledge-sharing events to address significant capacity gaps. It \nwill provide high-quality policy advice to government counterparts (primarily officials from finance \nministries and central banks), which can be incorporated into decision-making and public policy \ndialogue. Based on DMC demand as identified from policy dialogue between government officials \nand ADB staff, policy advice will cover topics such as financial reporting and management, state-\nowned enterprises, budget formulation and documentation, auditing and accounting, debt policy, \nand business regulatory environment. Advisory services will seek to build a platform for reforms, \nincluding those supported by ADB\u2019s policy-based lending, and will facilitate the delivery of scaled-\nup operations. Cross-learning opportunities across DMCs will be promoted, preferably through \nregional forums and workshops. \n \n11.  Policy  advice  will  incorporate  gender  considerations  wherever  feasible.  Women  will \ncomprise at least 30% of DMC trainees and/or attendees in capacity building workshops and \nevents. Preference will also be given to women trainers and/or panelists at such events. \n \n12.  Output 2: Economic indicators produced and shared in a timely manner. Established \nunder phase 1 of the TA, the database of economic indicators covering 14 Pacific DMCs will be \nupgraded under phase 3. To strengthen economic monitoring, the Pacific Economic Monitor will \ncontinue to publish timely economic data, which will be widely disseminated to raise public \nawareness of key policy issues. To better monitor the well-being of Pacific households beyond \nheadline economic figures, the TA will develop new indicators from primary data to be collected \nfrom the field through the Pacific country offices. These indicators will (i) track price movements \nin key consumption commodities (e.g., petroleum products, tuna, rice, and other staples) to \ndevelop  high-frequency  measures  of  purchasing  power  parities  across  Pacific  DMCs;  and \n(ii) estimate remaining gaps in access to infrastructure and basic services. Sex-disaggregated \ndata and/or indicators will be produced wherever feasible. \n \n13.  Knowledge products will be disseminated through various platforms. They will serve as \ninputs into the k-Nexus11 to build on ADB\u2019s accumulated knowledge and experience, minimize \nduplication, and facilitate dissemination. Knowledge products, including the Pacific Economic \nMonitor, will be publicly accessible through ADB's corporate website\u2014with government clearance \nif relevant. A limited number of copies of relevant knowledge products will be printed for general \ndissemination and targeted workshops in headquarters and resident missions. Proceedings from \nand presentations at workshops organized under the TA will be disseminated through the ADB \nand government websites. \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 The k-Nexus is ADB\u2019s internal database that contains completed and planned knowledge products and services by \nall departments, units, sector and thematic groups.  \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The governments of participating \nDMCs will provide counterpart support, which will be determined during TA implementation and \nmay come in the form of relevant country data, counterpart staff, office space for consultants, and \nother  in-kind  contributions.  Apart  from  consulting  services,  funds  for  regional  conferences, \nseminars, and training events will be provided through the TA and administered by PARD. The \nkey  expenditure  items are  listed  in  Appendix 2. The TA  budget may  be  increased  during \nimplementation subject to the demand for TA activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency. Specifically, PARD will administer and implement the \nTA from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2024. PARD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \norganize workshops and training activities in conjunction with DMC governments where feasible; \nand provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops.12 Implementation will be harmonized \nwith (i) ADB\u2019s other activities in the Pacific in coordination with country directors, country team \nleaders, and (ii) the activities of development partners by maintaining close relationships with \nbilateral and multilateral partners working in related fields. While no cofinancing is envisaged at \nthis  time,  opportunities  will  be  explored  during  TA  implementation.13 The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  April 2019\u2013March 2024 \nExecuting agency  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual international and  98 person-months  $1,235,500 \nnational consultants \nAdvance contracting  1 economics editor (international consultant) and 2 national advisors \n(national consultants)  \nDisbursement  TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n16.

ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.14 \n \n17.  The specific requirements for types of expertise and length of engagement will depend on \nthe scope of work, which will be determined during TA implementation in consultation with DMC \ngovernments where relevant. A more comprehensive terms of reference will be developed \naccordingly, and deliverables from consultancy outputs will be clarified. Consultants will be \nengaged on a continuous or intermittent basis, as necessary. Areas of expertise will include those \n                                                \n12 Travel costs for ADB staff acting as resource persons will be covered under the TA. \n13 Phase 2 includes $260,000 in cofinanced grants from the Government of Australia approved through additional \nfinancing in July 2017. \n14 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \nneeded to conduct economic monitoring and undertake analysis for policy reforms which can be \nimplemented by Pacific DMCs.
