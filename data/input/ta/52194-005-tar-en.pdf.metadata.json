The knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA) cluster  was  approved  on  15 \nSeptember 2018. The overall TA cluster is estimated at $1.5 million. The TA subproject 1 was \napproved on 15 October 2018, while the TA subprojects 2 and 3 were approved on 23 November \n2018 and 13 November 2018, respectively. The subproject is estimated to cost $350,000 and will \nbe financed on a grant basis from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Ecological Institute of the Forestry Industry Planning \nand Design Institute (EIFIPDI) of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) under \nthe Ministry of Natural Resources will serve as the executing and implementing agency of the \nsubproject. The design and monitoring framework of the subproject is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nB.  Subproject Outcome \n2.   The subproject will have the following outcome: capacity and institutional framework for \nequitable and inclusive sustainable forestry policies and programs enhanced. This will support \nthe outputs of the overall TA cluster by contributing to an enabling environment for ecological \ncompensation, innovative financing mechanisms for ecosystem protection, as well as knowledge \nsharing and dissemination. The subproject will be aligned with the following impact: green \neconomic development and ecological protection in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) \nachieved. The SFGA is committed to undertaking a policy research on equitable and inclusive \nsustainable forestry in the YREB. To achieve this, EIFIPDI requested ADB\u2019s support for the \noutputs outlined below. \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs, Methods, and Activities   \n3.  Output 1: Assessment of the status and prospects for the commercial forestry \nsector in the YREB prepared. This will include (i) a summary of the current status of the \ncommercial forestry in the YREB including timber and bamboo production, non-timber forest \nproducts, and agroforestry, including identification of key commercial forestry areas in the YREB, \nestimates of annual production, structure of output, assessment of the size and contributions of \nstate-owned, collective, and private household forestry to total production, measures of industry \nconcentration  ratio,  and  estimates  of  changes  over  time  in  all  of  these  indicators;  (ii)  an \nassessment of the future prospects of the commercial forestry sector in the YREB including \nestimated future demand in the People\u2019s Republic of China and globally, and the capacity of \ncurrent and future commercial forestry operations in the YREB to sustainably meet the current \nand estimated future demand; and (iii) a summary of current programs and policies targeting the \ndevelopment  and  management  of  the  commercial  forestry  and  agroforestry  sectors,  an \nassessment of their impacts and remaining legal and regulatory gaps and market failures to \nrealizing sustainable and profitable commercial forestry and agroforestry sectors.  \n4.  Output 2: Assessment of the status and current and future threats to forest and \nwetlands ecosystem conservation in the YREB prepared. This will include (i) a mapping and \ncategorization of forest and wetlands ecosystem types in the YREB and a prioritization of the \nthreats they face; (ii) a summary of current programs and policies targeting forest and wetlands \nconservation and restoration in the YREB, and an assessment of their ecological and rural welfare \nimpacts; (iii) a prioritization of forest and wetlands conservation targets in the YREB; and (iv) an \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 October 2018. \n ", "2 \nassessment of current regulatory gaps and funding requirements and shortfalls for realizing \nsustainable conservation and/or restoration of key forest and wetlands ecosystems in the YREB. \n5.
