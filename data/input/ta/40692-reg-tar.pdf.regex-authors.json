Since the adoption of the agriculture and natural resources research (ANRR) policy \npaper in 1995, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the Consultative Group on \nInternational  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR)  centers  and  other  international  agricultural \nresearch centers (IARCs) through an annual regional technical assistance (RETA) grant. ADB\u2019s \npolicy on ANRR addresses three strategic objectives: (i) sustainable management of natural \nresources, (ii) increases in agricultural productivity, and (iii) poverty reduction. Twelve RETA \ngrants have so far been approved, each supporting one or several projects of the IARCs. The \nfirst eight ANRR RETA projects have been completed, and six of these have been evaluated. All \nRETA projects evaluated have been rated as successful. Their outcomes have strengthened \nknowledge products and technical agriculture research and extension operations in numerous \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) while supporting ADB\u2019s operations in the agriculture and \nnatural resources (ANR) sector. The IARCs work in virtually all of ADB\u2019s DMCs, and several of \nthem have their headquarters in Asian DMCs. \n \n2.  A special evaluation study1 of ANRR policy recommended continued support to the \nIARCs, given the high returns on investments and relevance of the policy and research outputs \nof supported projects. While the ANRR policy specifies yearly ADB funding of $5 million to \nsupport ANRR, the support has recently been below that level due to a shortage of technical \nassistance (TA) funds. RETA projects have played an integral role in fulfilling ADB\u2019s operational \nobjectives  in  participating  DMCs.  They  have  also  addressed,  in  varying  degrees,  ADB\u2019s \noverarching goal of poverty reduction and such related priorities as regional cooperation and \nsustainable environmental management. The recent food crisis also calls for revitalizing ADB\u2019s \nsupport for ANRR. \n \n3.  The proposed RETA2 will be the 13th RETA project on ANRR. In response to the 2008 \nfood crisis in Asia, ADB discussed with both the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), \nwith its head office in Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines, and the International Food Policy Research \nInstitute (IFPRI), with its head office in Washington, D.C., on potential areas of support. In April \n2008, an IRRI delegation met with ADB\u2019s senior management and concerned staff, and a video \nconference was held between ADB and IFPRI. Based on these discussions, the project concept \nnote was developed, approved, and announced by the President during ADB\u2019s 2008 Annual \nMeeting in Madrid, Spain.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Food prices have increased substantially during 2007\u20132008. While prices have been \ngradually rising since 2000, there has been a sharp increase since mid-2007. Rising food prices \nand dwindling global stocks have put many governments in the Asia and Pacific region under \nenormous pressure to feed the most vulnerable and poor. Over a billion people in the region are \nseriously affected by the food price surge, as food expenditure accounts for about 60% of the \naverage total expenditure basket. Food and energy together account for more than 75% of total \nspending by the poor in the region.  \n \n5.  The world rice price has seen the most significant increase during 2007\u20132008. This is of \nparticular concern because about two thirds of the world\u2019s poor live in the rice-growing countries \nof  Asia.  Rice,  the  dominant  staple  in  Asia,  accounts  for  more  than  40%  of  the  calorie \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Special Evaluation Study on  the Policy Implementation  and Impact of Agriculture and Natural \nResources Research. Manila. \n2  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 July 2008.  \n ", "2   \nconsumption of most Asians. Poor people spend as much as 30\u201340% of their income on rice \nalone. The poor in Cambodia, for example, spend up to 80% of their income on rice. Ensuring \nsufficient supplies of rice that is affordable for the poor is thus crucial to poverty reduction. An \nimmediate challenge is to revitalize global rice production to achieve annual growth rates of \n1.2\u22121.5%. Additional grain production has to come from (i) increasing yields by optimizing land \nuse and reducing yield gaps; (ii) reducing physical grain losses that occur during harvest, \nstorage, and processing; and (iii) strengthening agricultural policies and farmers\u2019 capacity.   \n \n6.  Pest and disease attacks represent one of the most important threats to Asia\u2019s intensive \nrice production systems. Notably, the planthopper, which is one of the major pests in rice, has \nrecently returned to Asia\u2019s rice production areas. In 2005, planthopper outbreaks occurred in \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam. About 7.5 million hectares in \nthe PRC were infested, resulting in a loss of 2.8 million tons of paddy in just 3 months. In Viet \nNam, rice was infested by viruses, and, in 2006, a loss of 700,000 tons of rice was reported. \nThat prompted the Government of Viet Nam to ban rice exports in fear of domestic shortages.  \n \n7.  The postharvest losses that occur during harvest, storage, and processing are often in \nthe 10\u201320% range. Poor seed storage results in poor seed quality, and this affects crop yields. \nIn addition, farmers are losing out on income because of additional quality and quantity losses \nduring their traditional processing practices, allowing them to sell their paddy only at discounted \nprices. Clear potential has been demonstrated for recovering more rice grain by reducing losses, \nas well as for improving seed quality and rice yields.  \n \n8.  In addition to scientific and technological efforts to increase yield and reduce postharvest \nlosses, the current food crisis also calls for in-depth analysis of the existing set of agricultural \npolicies to examine (i) the distributional impacts of the food price surge and how far the public \npolicy of food safety nets has been effective in protecting the poor, (ii) how to improve food \nvalue  chains  that  can  ensure  a  lower  price  for  the  consumers  while  still  giving  a  good \nremunerative price to the farmers, (iii) how to effectively mobilize and utilize public investments \nand subsidies for agriculture and rural development, and (iv) how ADB can support and promote \nDMCs\u2019 agriculture and rural development through its policy dialogue and lending operations.  \n \n9.  The proposed RETA builds on the experience of previous ADB-funded RETA projects on \nANRR.  It  considers  the  finding  of  the  special  evaluation  study  that,  given  ADB\u2019s  limited \nresources to contribute to ANRR, a focused agenda is required that more closely follows ADB\u2019s \nlong-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)3 to realize ADB\u2019s vision of an Asia \nand Pacific region free of poverty. The design also incorporates key lessons from previous \nRETA projects, including the need for greater emphasis on (i) strengthening national agricultural \nresearch  system  capacity;  (ii) improving  linkages  among  researchers,  practitioners,  and \npolicymakers to better disseminate research results; and (iii) strengthening ADB\u2019s capacity to \ncoordinate, supervise, monitor, and evaluate ANR activities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the RETA will be increased food availability and reduced poverty in the \nparticipating DMCs. The outcome will be increased food production and security through the \nadoption of appropriate rice technologies and agricultural policies in participating DMCs.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "  3\n11.  The proposed RETA has two outputs. Output 1 is to increase rice production by reducing \npest  and  disease  outbreaks  and  through  appropriate  postharvest  technologies  in  the \nparticipating DMCs. Output 2 is to provide agricultural policy advice on food distribution and \nsafety nets, value chains, and investments and subsidies for the Asia and Pacific region. The \nparticipating DMCs for component 1 include Cambodia, PRC, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. These \ncountries are targeted due to the extent of their preharvest losses caused by planthoppers and \ndiseases, postharvest problems, and the potential to reduce preventable crop failures and \nlosses as well as protect the environment. The participating DMCs for component 2 include \nBangladesh, PRC, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. These countries are selected as \nmodels for the perceived needs of DMCs in the region, for their size, and considering the levels \nof  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  these  countries\u2019  ANR  sectors.  Lessons  from  the  TA  will  be \ndisseminated to other DMCs through publications, workshops, and policy forums. The design \nand monitoring framework of the RETA is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The outputs and activities have been identified in close consultation with participating \nDMCs.4 ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA,5 and the implementing agencies (IAs) will \nbe IFPRI and IRRI. A summary of ADB\u2019s assistance to IARCs, including CGIAR, is in Appendix \n2. Detailed descriptions of the components are in Appendix 3.  \n \n13.  Component 1: Bringing about Sustainable Rice Production in Asia by Reducing \nPreventable Pre- and Postharvest Losses. IRRI will be the IA for component 1. Within its \nlong-term research framework, IRRI has prepared a 5-year project to explore innovative ways of \nreducing  rice  crop  vulnerability  to  preharvest  losses  caused  by  planthoppers  and  disease \noutbreaks, as well as to reduce postharvest losses through improved postharvest technologies \nand management options. While the whole Project is for 5 years, the RETA will support the \nstart-up costs of the Project\u2019s first year. ADB may provide subsequent funding support to the \nProject subject to its initial success and the availability of funds. ADB\u2019s funding of this RETA \ndoes not, however, commit ADB to any further funding.  \n \n14.  Component 1 has two subcomponents. Subcomponent 1 is to reduce the vulnerability of \ncrops to preharvest losses caused by planthoppers and disease outbreaks. Subcomponent 1 \nwill (i) identify a new field resistance screening method and germplasm with durable field \nresistance to planthoppers and diseases, (ii) develop and pilot strategies to manage viruses\u2019 \nspread  in  rice  fields,  (iii)  develop  ecologically-based  management  of  pest  outbreaks,  (iv) \nintegrate  durable  resistance  and  ecological  methods  into  management  practices,  and  (v) \nenhance participating DMCs\u2019 research and extension capacities and disseminate the findings. \nSubcomponent 2 is to reduce postharvest losses and increase farmers\u2019 incomes by producing \nbetter quality rice. Subcomponent 2 will (i) examine appropriate postharvest technologies and \nmanagement options, (ii) develop suitable agricultural extension methodologies and verify them \non a pilot basis, (iii) develop business models and support service linkages for users of the \ntechnologies,  (iv)  replicate  business  models  and  postharvest  management  options  through \nnational  programs,  and  (v)  develop  multi-stakeholder  platforms  for  sustained  impact.  Both \nsubcomponents will review and build on lessons from previous ADB operations.  \n \n15.  Component 2: Improving Agricultural Policies for Ensuring Food Security. The \nobjective of component 2 is to identify a policy mix that can ensure both short- and long-term \n                                                 \n4  A no-objection letter will be obtained from each participating developing member country as a condition for ADB \nfinancing under the TA. \n5  ADB\u2019s agriculture and natural resources focal point will represent ADB. \n ", "4   \nfood security in the region. Component 2 has four subcomponents. IFPRI will be the IA for \nsubcomponents 1\u20133. IFPRI and ADB will be joint IAs for subcomponent 4.  \n \n16.  Subcomponent 1 will examine the distributional impacts of food price increases and \ncorresponding safety nets. Specifically, the subcomponent will examine (i) how far the global \nsurge in prices has been transmitted to domestic markets, (ii) the impact of these surging food \nprices on the most vulnerable sections of the society, (iii) how the vulnerable groups are coping \nwith the situation, (iv) how far the public policy of safety nets has been effective in protecting \nthem, and (v) how policies can be improved. Subcomponent 1 will undertake country-specific \nstudies in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. Subcomponent 2 will help to identify and \nrecommend  policies  to  improve  efficiency  in  the  value  chain  of  food  products.  This \nsubcomponent will also examine the value chain of such key commodities as rice and potatoes \nto  understand  better  the  price  determination  between  the  farmer  and  consumer,  thereby \nsuggesting policy options that can ensure a lower price for the consumer while still ensuring a \nfair  price  to  the  farmers.  Subcomponent  2  will  also  undertake  country-specific  studies  in \nBangladesh, India, and Indonesia. Subcomponent 3 will examine the investments and subsidies \nrelated to agriculture and rural development, as well as their impacts on growth in agricultural \nproduction  and  alleviating  rural  poverty.  The  countries  participating  for  this  subcomponent \ninclude Bangladesh, PRC, India, and Viet Nam. Subcomponent 4 will disseminate the policy \nrecommendations to DMC policy makers and ADB. This subcomponent specifically will help to (i) \norganize a series of policy consultation and dissemination workshops in the participating DMCs \nand ADB, (ii) examine emerging agricultural policy issues in the region, and develop quick-\nresponse  policy  notes  and  relevant  knowledge  products  for  DMCs;  and  (iii)  review  ADB\u2019s \nagricultural and natural resources lending and nonlending operations, and provide suggestions \non how these could be further improved.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $3.21 million equivalent. ADB will finance $3 \nmillion, comprising $2 million for component 1 and $1 million for component 2. The financing will \nbe provided on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. With respect to component 1, IRRI \nwill provide an in-kind contribution of $0.12 million equivalent in staff time, research operations \nand supplies, and administrative and support costs. For component 2, meanwhile, IFPRI will \ncontribute  $0.09  million  equivalent  in  staff  time,  research  operations  and  supplies,  and \nadministrative and support costs. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The RETA\u2019s implementation is expected to begin in October 2008 and be completed in \nOctober 2010. The single-source selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) will be adopted to select IRRI and IFPRI. The \nuse of this method is justified given their unique capabilities and experiences in the selected \ntopics. Two individual consultants (10 person-months) will be recruited by ADB for monitoring, \nevaluating, and disseminating TA results to DMCs and ADB. The funding and implementation of \neach component of the TA are subject to (i) signing of two separate TA agreements between \nADB and IRRI and IFPRI, respectively; (ii) receipt by ADB of no-objection letters from the \nrelevant participating DMCs; and (iii) approval by ADB of a detailed work program for each \nsubcomponent or for the component. \n \n19.  Under component 1, IRRI will hold an inception workshop within 3 months of the RETA\u2019s \napproval to firm up the project plans and implementation arrangements with partners. A midterm ", "  5\nworkshop and a final workshop will be held within 9 months and 18 months of the RETA \napproval, respectively. Training and dissemination workshops will be undertaken during RETA \nimplementation, as detailed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). IRRI will \nsubmit the following reports to ADB: (i) an inception report, (ii) midterm progress reports, (iii) a \nfinal report, (iv) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of project funds, (v) \naudited annual financial statements including the use of project funds, and (vi) a draft final \ncompletion report. IRRI will provide about 128 person-months of consulting services over a \n2-year period, including 20 person-months of international consultants and 108 person-months \nof national consultants. IRRI will engage, from its existing staff, two entomologists, one plant \nvirologist, one postharvest specialist, one business development and market specialist, and one \nimpact pathway specialist. In addition to IRRI staff, IRRI will also recruit experts for a total of 91 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  in  areas  of  communication,  insect  ecology,  insect \ntoxicology, business development, impact pathway, and training. \n \n20.  Under component 2, IFPRI will hold an inception workshop within 3 months after RETA \napproval to firm up project plans and implementation arrangements with partners. A midterm \nworkshop and a final workshop will be held within 12 months and 24 months, respectively, after \nRETA approval. The policy consultation and dissemination workshops, jointly coordinated by \nIFPRI and ADB, will take place in the second year. IFPRI will submit the following reports to \nADB: (i) an inception report, (ii) midterm progress reports, (iii) a final report, (iv) semiannual \nfinancial  statements  accounting  for  the  use  of  project  funds,  (v)  audited  annual  financial \nstatements including the use of project funds, and (vi) a draft final completion report. Under \nsubcomponents 1\u20133, with a contract value of $0.7 million, a total of 28 person-months of \nconsulting services of agricultural policy specialists will be contracted. Under subcomponent 4, \nwith a contract value of $0.3 million, 10 person-months of consulting services of two agricultural \npolicy specialists will be contracted directly by ADB due to ADB\u2019s comparative advantages in \nmonitoring and disseminating policy results to DMCs and within ADB.    \n \n21.  The IAs will procure goods and related services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). They will engage consultants in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. At the end of each project, equipment purchased under \nthe  RETA  will  be  assigned  to  the  IAs  concerned.  Disbursement  under  the  RETA  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as \namended from time to time). The IAs have made plans for disseminating the outputs and \nevaluating the outcome. The outputs will be published in academic journals, technical books, \nand  reports  as  well  as  posted  on  IAs\u2019  and  ADB\u2019s  websites.  A  comprehensive  media \ndissemination plan will be developed during TA implementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis for the Thirteenth Agriculture and \nNatural Resources Research at International Agricultural Research Centers. \n ", "6    Appendix 1         \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n    Data Sources   \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  and/or Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased food availability and  Food availability in DMCs\u2019  Review of related  \u2022  There is commitment on the part of \nreduced poverty in participating  strategic reserves increased  documents and  the DMCs. \ndeveloping member countries  by 5% from 2008 level by  implementation   \n(DMCs) \u00a0 2015.  arrangements  \u2022  DMCs adopt conducive agricultural \n      and environmental policies. \nPoverty reduced by 0.5%  Impact assessment   \nfrom 2008 level by 2015  reports  Risks \nthrough improved safety net    \u2022  Participating DMCs allocate \nprograms for the vulnerable  Performance and  inadequate budgets to facilitate \ngroups in the DMCs.     monitoring reports,  implementation. \n  and final report   \n  \u2022  Support from bilateral and \nInternational  multilateral agencies is not \nand national   available. \nstatistics in DMCs   \n \nAnnual research \nprogram report and \nreview of \nimplementing \nagencies (IAs) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased food production and  At least three DMCs adopt  Project final report  \u2022  Host governments are willing to \nsecurity through the adoption of  ecologically-based    adopt the new methodologies and \nappropriate rice technologies  management methods.

Component  1:  Bringing  about  Sustainable  Rice  Production  in  Asia  by  Reducing \nPreventable Pre- and Postharvest Losses (International Rice Research Institute [IRRI])  \n \n  1.  Introduction  \n \n1.  Intensive rice production systems, covering about 80 million hectares and producing 75% of \nthe world\u2019s rice needs, are vital for food security and poverty reduction in both Asia\u2019s rural and \nurban areas. Production growth rates in recent years have been less than 1% per year, causing a \ntight rice supply-demand situation in many countries. To keep pace with rising demand for rice due \nto population growth, rice production must expand at an annual rate of 1.2\u20131.5%. To a large extent, \nthis growth will have to come from reducing preventable pre- and postharvest losses. Some \npreharvest  losses  are  due  to  pest  outbreaks,  which  often  are  caused  by  unsustainable \nmanagement practices that threaten vital ecosystem services. Postharvest losses are due to poor \nhandling and poor storage management.  \n \n2.  Rice production in Asia continues to be threatened by outbreaks of planthoppers and the \ndiseases they carry, as well as by losses from inadequate postharvest technologies and systems. \nIn 2005, planthopper outbreaks occurred in People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, Korea, and \nViet Nam. About 7.5 million hectares in the PRC were infested, resulting in a loss of 2.8 million tons \nof paddy in just 3 months. In Viet Nam, rice was infested by viruses, and, in 2006, a loss of \n700,000 tons of rice was reported. These outbreaks often prompt governments to ban rice exports \nand release subsidized pesticides that further deteriorate the vital ecosystem services that regulate \npests, thus making the situation worse.  \n \n3.  Planthopper outbreaks are abnormal events caused by disrupting factors such as weather \nand  pesticides.  Two  main  species  infest  rice,  the  brown  planthopper  and  the  whitebacked \nplanthopper. Generally kept under control under normal circumstances by both plant resistance \nand biological control, these pests thrive in conditions where the host plants are highly susceptible \nand natural biological control is destroyed by pesticides.1 Changes in climate (such as typhoons \nthat might increase migration) and temperatures (which increase their reproduction rates) can also \ntrigger outbreaks. Although planthopper resistant-varieties have been developed in the past 30 \nyears, resistance has been broken down or compromised by heavy insecticide use.2  As a result, \nmany rice varieties grown in PRC, Indonesia, and Viet Nam have no form of resistance. With \nintensive  insecticide  applications,  and  especially  in  the  early  crop  stages,  planthoppers  have \ndeveloped  insecticide  resistance. 3  Their  exponential  population  growth  has  been  to  such \nmagnitudes that there has appeared a condition known as \u201chopper burn,\u201d wherein the rice crop is \ncompletely sucked dry.  \u00a0\n \n                                                 \n1  Heong, K.L., and K.

Paper presented at the International Workshop on \nForecasting and Management of Rice Planthoppers in East Asia: Their Ecology and Genetics. National Agriculture and \nResearch Center, Kumamoto, Japan, 4\u20135 December 2007. \n ", "Appendix 3        21 \n4.  Postharvest losses in Southeast Asian countries are typically 15\u201320% by loss of weight, \nand, when quality is factored in, this can result in a 10\u201330% loss of value in the market. Physical \nlosses through the postharvest chain caused by inefficient postharvest management, outdated \npostharvest technology (PHT), and storage pests typically can reach 15\u201320%. Reducing these \nlosses will contribute to increased income in rural communities and to national food security by \nmaking more rice available. A reduction in postharvest losses in Indonesia by 5% would provide \nabout 2.6 million tons more paddy, or about 1.8 million tons of milled rice, which is more than the \n1.5 million tons of imports anticipated for 2008. Delays in postharvest operations caused by labor \nshortage and lack of appropriate postharvest equipment also cause quality losses that reduce the \nvalue of the milled rice by 10\u201330% in the market, thus further reducing farmers\u2019 incomes from their \nharvests and providing consumers with poor quality rice. \n \n5.  Although postharvest losses occur in all rice cropping systems, they are most severe in the \nintensive systems, especially where double cropping leads to one harvest\u2019s occurring in the wet \nseason and where new varieties are grown. New varieties may be more vulnerable than traditional \nvarieties that are better adapted to local conditions. Because food security and poverty reduction \nare development priorities for Cambodia, Indonesia, and Viet Nam, reducing losses and increasing \nincome through value addition are relevant project objectives for all these countries.  \n \n6.  The successful introduction of drying and harvesting systems in southern Viet Nam, and \nmore recently in South Sumatra, and of the axial-flow thresher throughout Southeast Asia has \nshown that most postharvest equipment will be locally produced by small businesses with little \naccess to information and technology. They tend also to have limited research and development \ncapacity. The delivery of postharvest technology therefore requires, in addition to working with \nnational agricultural research systems, close collaboration with and support to local manufacturers \nin adapting those technologies to local conditions, materials available, and location-specific users\u2019 \nneeds. Other support needs, such as to finance postharvest equipment and marketing higher-\nquality products, require new partnership models. IRRI has successfully piloted some of these, \nsuch as working closely with rice millers\u2019 associations in extending new technologies to farmers. \nIRRI has recently developed preliminary business plans for small and medium enterprises to \nimplement postharvest technologies. \n \n2.  The Technical Assistance \n \n7.  In line with ADB\u2019s responses to soaring food prices,4 component 1 will develop strategies \nand methods to reduce incidences of crop failure and losses from preharvest pest and disease \noutbreaks and postharvest handling and storage. Component 1 will contribute to medium- to long-\nterm responses for reducing the incidence of crop failures, rehabilitating and upgrading postharvest \nprocessing  facilities,  providing  biosecurity  to  protect  biodiversity,  promoting  environmental \nsustainability, and enhancing food safety and biosafety.  \n \n8.  The  component  has  two  subcomponents.  Subcomponent  1  will  focus  on  reducing \nvulnerability of crops to preharvest losses caused by planthopper outbreaks. Subcomponent 2 will \nfocus on reducing postharvest losses and increasing income by producing better quality rice. The \noutputs  and  activities  under  each  subcomponent  are  detailed  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  Subcomponent  1  aims  to  reduce  crops\u2019  vulnerability  to  preharvest  losses  caused  by \nplanthopper outbreaks. These outbreaks result from low invasion resistance in the cropping system. \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008. Soaring food prices: response to the crisis. Manila. \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \nSusceptible varieties may contain no planthopper resistance genes at all or just one or two \u201cseed \nbox\u201d genes that break down easily. Such ecosystem services as natural biological control keep \nplanthoppers in low densities, and when these services are compromised by climate change or \nexcessive insecticide use, planthopper and virus outbreaks occur. This subcomponent\u2019s activities \nwill focus on developing a new phenotypic assessment technique to identify field-resistance genes, \nvirus  epidemiology,  and  population  ecology  to  integrate  field  resistance  using  ecological \nengineering principles and develop sustainable management methods for preventing outbreaks \nthat can be communicated via extension channels and media to thousands of rice farmers.  \n \n10.  Subcomponent 1 has five specific outputs: (i) a new field resistance screening method and \ngermplasm  with  durable  field  resistance  to  planthoppers  and  virus  diseases  identified  for \nincorporation into new elite breeding lines and mega-varieties; (ii) strategies to manage viruses \nspread in rice fields developed and implemented in pilot sites; (iii) ecologically-based management \nof  outbreak  pests  such  as  planthoppers  developed  and  key  sustainability  indicators  of  pest \noutbreaks monitored; (iv) management practices integrating durable resistance and ecological \nmethods  evaluated  by  farmers,  communicated  through  policy  dialogues,  and  upscaled  using \ncommunication  media  in  pilot  sites;  and  (v)  enhanced  national  agricultural  research  system \npartners\u2019  research  and  extension  capacities  in  plant  resistance,  ecological  management  of \noutbreak pests, insecticide resistance research, and communication. \n \n11.  In order to achieve the outputs above, a series of activities detailed in the design and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1 will be carried out. The key activities to be supported under \nthe regional technical assistance (RETA) during the first year include (i) project inception; (ii) \ndeveloping  an  improved  screening  method  to  identify  durable  genes  for  field  resistance  to \nplanthopper and viruses; (iii) developing a diagnostic kit for field use to detect viruses in plants and \ninsect vectors; (iv) developing indicators to monitor pest control services in rice ecosystems; (v) \ndeveloping insecticide-resistance monitoring methods and implementing them in strategic areas; \n(vi)  developing  country-specific  upscaling  strategies  and  facilitating  their  implementation;  (vii) \nconducting baseline and post-test surveys to monitor farmer adoption; (viii) conducting a training \ncourse in field ecological research methods and biodiversity analysis; (ix) conducting a training \ncourse  in  insecticide-resistance  monitoring  and  probit  analysis;  and  (x)  conducting  a  training \ncourse on farmer pest management decision making, and conducting surveys of farmers and \nextension communication methods. \n \n12.  Subcomponent 2 aims to reduce postharvest losses and increase incomes by producing \nbetter quality rice. This component is built on the premise that accelerated and sustained impact \nfrom improved postharvest management will be achieved by (i) working with key stakeholders in \neach country to agree upon a common vision for reducing postharvest losses; (ii) agreeing with the \nsame stakeholders on the impact pathways to achieve that vision and who will do what; and (iii) \nmeeting  regularly  to  reflect  on  progress  along  the  impact  pathways,  to  learn,  to  spot  new \nopportunities and threats, and to adapt. This process will be managed by in-country learning \nalliances. Membership in learning alliances has been found to boost members\u2019 awareness of the \ndiversity  of  options  and  their  ownership  of  them,  increase  interaction  among  members,  and \nimprove their ability to identify and choose what works (including policies). Hence, the learning \nalliances represent the project\u2019s main strategy for both accelerating adaptation and adoption of \npostharvest technologies and helping create a more favorable policy environment for their spread. \n \n13.  Subcomponent 2 is to reduce postharvest losses and increase income by producing better \nquality rice through five specific outputs: (i) appropriate postharvest technologies and improved \npostharvest  management  options  examined  and  developed,  (ii)  suitable  agricultural  extension \nmethodologies developed and verified on a pilot basis, (iii) business models and support service \n ", "Appendix 3        23 \nlinkages  for  users  of  the  technologies  developed,  (iv)  business  models  and  postharvest \nmanagement options replicated through national programs, and (v) multi-stakeholder platforms for \nincreased and sustained impact developed.  \n \n14.  The key activities to be supported by the RETA include (i) conducting baseline studies and \ntechnology  need  assessments  in  all  major  rice-producing  provinces  and  deciding  on  project \nlocations;  (ii)  adapting  dryers  to  local  conditions;  (iii)  developing  or  adapting  extension \nmethodologies based on technology-specific extension functions; (iv) identifying and supporting \npublic  and  private  stakeholders  in  the  national  extension  systems  and  verifying  extension \nmethodologies; (v) developing technology-specific business models reflecting local conditions and \nmarkets; (vi) analyzing existing market constraints and market information systems; (vii) expanding \npilot rice marketing information systems or integrating rice information into national systems in \nCambodia;  (viii)  identifying  both  public  and  private  postharvest  stakeholders;  (ix)  conducting \nparticipatory impact pathway analysis workshops with all relevant stakeholders in all countries, \nincluding  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  and  Viet  Nam;  (x)  initiating  national  learning  alliances  and \norganizing periodic meetings; and (xi) concluding collaboration agreements with key stakeholders \nand training partners.  \n \n15.  The total cost of the component is $2.12 million equivalent. ADB will provide a grant of $2 \nmillion equivalent, and the remaining cost will be financed by IRRI ($120,000 equivalent).   \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  IRRI will be the implementing agency (IA) for component 1. The component will employ a \nmulti-stakeholder participatory process in planning, reviewing, and monitoring project outputs in \nfour countries\u2014Cambodia, PRC, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. These countries are targeted based on \nthe extent of the planthoppers and postharvest problems they face, their substantial areas under \nrice, and the potential for the Project to make a significant impact to reduce preventable crop \nfailures and losses as well as protect the environment.  \n \n17.  IRRI will implement both subcomponents in partnership with government agencies and \nnational  agricultural  research  systems.  In  Cambodia,  the  partners  include  (i)  Cambodian \nAgricultural Research and Development Institute; (ii) Royal University of Agriculture; (iii) Cambodia \nRice Millers Association; and (iv) Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. In Indonesia, the \npartners include (i) Rice Research Institute of Indonesia, (ii) Agency for Agricultural Research and \nDevelopment, (iii) Assessment Institute for Agricultural Technology, and (iv) Indonesian Centre for \nAgricultural Postharvest Research and Development. In the PRC, the partners include (i) Key \nLaboratory for Insect Science, Zhejiang University; (ii) Plant Protection Institute, Zhejiang Academy \nof Agricultural Sciences; (iii) local government of Jin Hua County, Zhejiang Province; and (iv) China \nNational Rice Research Institute. In Viet Nam, the partners include (i) Can Tho University; (ii) \nUniversity of Agriculture and Forestry; (iii) Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; (iv) Plant \nProtection Department; (v) Southern Plant Protection Center, Long Dinh; (vi) Cuu Long Rice \nResearch Institute; (vii) National Institute of Plant Protection; (viii) Institute of Agricultural Sciences; \n(ix)  provincial  government  of  Tiengiang  Province;  (x)  Viet  Nam  Institute  of  Agricultural  and \nPostharvest  Technology;  (xi)  Southern  Institute  of  Agricultural  Engineering  and  Postharvest \nTechnology, Nong Lam University; and (xii) Hue Agriculture and Forestry. Additional partners will \nbe identified during the project implementation. \u00a0\n \n18.  Component 1 will be implemented over 2 years, from October 2008 to October 2010. The \ncomponent will be managed by two co-leaders based at IRRI, one responsible for subcomponent 1 \nand  the  other  responsible  for  subcomponent  2.  Detailed  work  plans  for  each  activity  will  be \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \ndeveloped in consultation with IRRI\u2019s and national agricultural research systems\u2019 scientists and \nADB, and discussed during the inception workshop. The project members will meet every 6 months \nto review progress, plan new activities, and/or make adjustments in order to deliver the output \ntargets. ADB will have observer status. Coordination and planning meetings will be organized \nregularly to review progress, develop work plans, respond to emerging constraints, ensure active \nparticipation of policymakers, and enhance integration among the participating countries.  \n \n19.  IRRI will hold an inception workshop within 3 months after initiation to firm up project plans \nand implementation arrangements with partners. Midterm and final workshops will be held within 9 \nmonths  and  18  months,  respectively,  after  initiation.  Training  and  dissemination  workshops, \ndetailed in Appendix 1, will take place throughout the 2 years. IRRI must submit the following \nreports  to  ADB:  (i)  an  inception  report,  (ii)  midterm  progress  reports,  (iii)  a  final  report,  (iv) \nsemiannual  financial  statements  accounting  for  the  use  of  project  funds,  (v)  audited  annual \nfinancial statements including the use of project funds, and (vi) a draft final completion report. \n \n20.  IRRI is contracted to provide an estimated 128 person-months of consulting services over a \n2-year period, including 20 person-months of international consultants and 108 person-months of \nnational consultants. IRRI will engage, from its existing staff, two entomologists, one plant virologist, \none postharvest specialist, one business development and market specialist, and one impact \npathway specialist. In addition to IRRI staff, IRRI will also recruit a total of 91 person-months of \nconsulting  services  in  areas  of  communication,  insect  ecology,  insect  toxicology,  business \ndevelopment impact pathway, and training. The terms of references for consultants are included in \nthe supplementary appendixes. IRRI will recruit and engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other agreements \nsatisfactory to ADB, and will procure goods and services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nB.  Component  2:  Improving  Agricultural  Policies  for  Ensuring  Food  Security \n(International Food Policy Research Institute [IFPRI] and ADB) \n \n  1.  Introduction  \n \n21.  Component  2  aims  at  improving  agricultural  policies  for  ensuring  food  security.  This \ncomponent focuses on South, Southeast, and East Asia, with case studies in Bangladesh, PRC, \nIndia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. These countries not only account for more than 60% of \nthe world\u2019s poor, but they also are major food consumers and producers.  \n \n22.  Component 2 has four subcomponents. Subcomponent 1 is to examine the distributional \nimpacts of food price increases and corresponding safety nets. Specifically, the subcomponent \nexamines (i) how far the global surge in prices has transmitted to domestic markets, (ii) the impact \nof these surging food prices on the most vulnerable groups of the society, (iii) how the vulnerable \ngroups are coping with the situation, (iv) to what extent the public policy of safety nets has been \neffective in protecting them, and (v) how policies can be improved. In order to achieve these \noutputs, the following key activities will be carried out: (i) building databases of historical local price \nseries for basic food commodities at both developing member country (DMC) level and within the \nparticipating  DMCs,  (ii)  econometrically  modeling  the  price  transmission  mechanism  from \ninternational prices to local consumer and producer prices, (iii) building an analytical model for \ndistributional impacts of country-specific food price inflation, (iv) identifying safety net target groups \nand estimating the size of safety net transfers, and (v) policy consultation with stakeholders. The \nparticipating DMCs for this subcomponent are Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Viet Nam.  \n \n ", "Appendix 3        25 \n23.  Subcomponent 2 is to examine policies to improve efficiency in food products value chains. \nThe subcomponent aims to open the \u201cblack box\u201d in the value chains of such key commodities as \nrice and potatoes to better understand price formation between the farmer and consumer, and \nthereby to suggest policy options that can ensure a lower price for the consumers while still \nproviding a good remunerative price to the farmers. The key activities under this subcomponent \ninclude (i) desk review of relevant studies and documents; (ii) building a database of key staple \nvalue chains that include farmers, traders, supermarkets, and processors in the participating DMCs; \n(iii) analyzing value chains for the key staples selected; and (iv) policy consultation with key \nstakeholders. This subcomponent\u2019s participating DMCs include Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia, \nand the focus-food commodities are two major staples for the poor, namely rice and potato. \n \n24.  Subcomponent 3 is to examine the investments and subsidies related to agriculture and \nrural development, as well as their impacts on growth of agricultural production and alleviating rural \npoverty. Key activities under this subcomponent include (i) desk review of relevant studies and \ndocuments; (ii) collecting household data for various key staple crops such as quantities of food \nsupply,  input  prices,  and  prices  of  competing  crops  in  the  participating  countries;  (iii) \neconometrically estimating supply functions for the key staple crops; (iv) analyzing the supply \nfunctions for policy implications; and (v) policy consultation with key stakeholders. The participating \nDMCs for this subcomponent include Bangladesh, PRC, India, and Viet Nam.  \n \n25.  Subcomponent 4 is to disseminate the policy recommendations and strengthen ADB\u2019s \npolicy dialogue and lending operation to its DMCs on agriculture and rural development issues. \nThis subcomponent specifically will (i) organize a series of policy consultation and dissemination \nworkshops in the participating DMCs and ADB, (ii) examine emerging agricultural policy issues in \nthe region and develop quick-response policy notes and knowledge products for DMCs, and (iii) \nreview ADB agricultural and natural resources lending and nonlending operations and provide \nsuggestions on how they can be further improved.   \n \n26.  The key outputs for this component are policy advice developed and disseminated relating \nto food safety net, food value chain, agricultural investment and subsidies, and agricultural policies \nassociated with ADB operations. Appendix 1 details the key activities for each subcomponent.  \n \n27.  The total cost of component 2 is $1.09 million equivalent. ADB will provide a grant of $1.0 \nmillion equivalent, including $700,000 equivalent for subcomponents 1, 2, and 3 and $300,000 for \nsubcomponent  4.  The  remaining  cost  of  $90,000  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  an  in-kind \ncontribution from IFPRI.  \n \n2.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  Component 2 will be implemented over 2 years, from October 2008 to October 2010. IFPRI \nis the IA for subcomponents 1, 2, and 3. IFPRI and ADB are the joint IAs for subcomponent 4.  \n \n29.  IFPRI will hold an inception workshop within 3 months of RETA approval to firm up project \nplans and implementation arrangements with partners. Midterm and final workshops will be held \nwithin  12  months  and  24  months,  respectively,  after  inception.  Policy  consultation  and \ndissemination workshops, jointly coordinated by IFPRI and ADB, will take place in the second year. \nIFPRI must submit the following to ADB: (i) an inception report, (ii) midterm progress reports, (iii) a \nfinal report, (iv) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of project funds, (v) audited \nannual financial statements including the use of project funds, and (vi) a draft final completion \nreport.   \n \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \n30.  Under  subcomponents  1\u20133,  a  total  of  28  person-months  of  consulting  services  of \nagricultural policy specialists will be contracted. Under subcomponent 4, 10 person-months of \nconsulting services will be contracted directly by ADB due to ADB\u2019s comparative advantages in \nmonitoring and disseminating policy results to DMCs and within ADB.    \n \n31.  The  IA  will  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. It will procure goods and services in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n ", "  Appendix 4  27\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Component  Component   \nItem  1  2  Total \nA.
