THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  ensuing  project  will  improve  urban  transport  system  in  Bangkok,  Thailand  for \nefficient  and  safe  movements  of  people.  It  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of supporting sustainable and inclusive growth. The project will be aligned \nwith the following impact: access to social and economic opportunities in support of inclusive \neconomic  growth  enhanced  under  the  twelfth  National  Economic  and  Social  Development \nPlan.1  \n \n2.  The outcome of the project will be urban transport system in Bangkok improved. The \noutputs of the project will be (i) Bangkok mass rapid transit (MRT) South Purple Line constructed \nand  operational,  and  (ii)  capacity  in  implementing  and  managing  urban  rail  MRT  system \nstrengthened. \n \n3.  The total estimated cost of the project is $3,000 million, including physical and price \ncontingencies, and local taxes and duties. The proposed ADB financing modality is a project \nloan of $240 million from ordinary capital resources to finance the advance payments of all the \ncivil works contracts and consulting services. The government will fund the remaining balance of \ncivil work and consulting services. The government financing will also cover resettlement and \nincremental administration. Both the ensuing loan and this transaction TA are included in the \nADB\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan 2017-2019 for Thailand. \n \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Justification  \n4.  The transaction TA (TRTA) will enhance readiness for the ensuing project. To satisfy \nADB\u2019s due diligence requirements, the depth and coverage of technical, financial, and economic \nanalyses will be verified, reviewed, updated, strengthened, and presented in the prescribed \nformat.  Supplementary  analyses  on  social  and  environmental  safeguards  also  need  to  be \nprepared to comply with ADB requirements. The TRTA resources will be used to prepare these \nanalyses  and  documentation  to  be  considered  by  ADB  Board.  In  addition,  the  TRTA  will \nstrengthen capacity for sound implementation and management of urban rail MRT system, \nincluding the ensuing project, in future years.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n5.  Output 1: Due diligence on the proposed project completed. The TRTA will support \nADB to conduct full due diligence of the proposed project, including technical, economic and \nfinancial, governance, poverty and social, and safeguards aspects. The due diligence will build \non top of, and augment the feasibility study and preliminary engineering design conducted by \nthe government for the ensuing project, and ensure that the project is prepared to meet all ADB \npolicies and requirements.  \n6.  Output  2:  Urban  rail  MRT  and  multimodal  transport  integration  network  plan \ndeveloped. The TRTA will help the government to develop a multimodal transport network \nintegration plan to achieve both fare and physical integrations between different urban rail MRT \n                                                 \n1 Government of Thailand. Office of National Economic and Social Development Board. 2016. 12th National Economic  \n   and Social Development Plan 2017-2021. Bangkok. ", " 2   \n \nlines and public transport services to improve affordability and connectivity of the overall urban \ntransport network to maximize its efficacy. The intention is for this multimodal transport network \nintegration  plan  to  be  a  strategic  document,  which  will  guide  the  efficient  planning, \nimplementation, and operations of an integrated urban transport network.     \n   \n7.  Output  3:  Capacity  in  implementing  and  managing  urban  rail  operations  and \nmaintenance  strengthened.  The  government  is  technically  highly  competent  in  executing \ninvestment  projects,  including  those  with  high  complexity.  Nevertheless,  the  government \nrequires capacity strengthening in implementing and managing of urban rail operations and \nmaintenance such as effective implementation and management of concessions through public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) to ensure value for money rendered by private sector. The output will \narticulate the function and role of the government as a regulator and define responsibilities of \nconcerned agencies in urban rail projects planning, implementation and operations.  \n \n8.  Furthermore, the TA will support the conduct of knowledge transfer of international best \npractices on topics which are to be covered under, or related to Outputs 2 and 3. Topics will be \nselected based on a needs assessment, and be delivered by consultants. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.65 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n10.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, and \nother in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB, through SETC of SERD, will select, supervise and \nevaluate consultants (details are in Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2017\u2013December 2021\nExecuting agency  Mass Rapid Transit Authority (MRTA)\nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nICS  54 person-months  $1,308,000 \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants \nShopping  1 contract  $10,000 \nAdvance contracting  To expedite the conduct of TRTA, selection of key individual consultant \npositions will commence through advance contracting following PAI 2.04. \nNegotiation and signing of the consulting contract will only occur after the TA \nbecomes effective tentatively in October 2017.  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Software purchased under the TRTA will be handed over to the Executing \na  rrangement upon TA completion  Agency upon TA completion. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, PAI = Project Administration Instructions, TA \n= technical assistance, TRTA = transaction technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n ", "  3 \n \n \n12.  Consulting  services.  The TRTA will require approximately 36 person-months (PMs) of \ninternational consultants and 18 PMs of national consultants\u2019 inputs. These consultants will be \nrecruited individually. Output based contracts will be maximized to extent possible to achieve \nadministrative efficiency. For project due diligence where feasibility study is already prepared by \nthe  Mass  Rapid  Transit  Authority  of  Thailand  (MRTA)  following  government  internal \nrequirements, hiring individual consultants with short duration is more appropriate for quick \nmobilization of consulting services, and more cost-effective than firms. The consultants will \nprocure goods, mainly in the form of software for use in transport demand modelling. Resource \nperson contracts (maximum 2 PM) will be reserved to allow inputs from highly specialized \nexperts with hand-on experience in rail management and operations, particularly to support \ncapacity strengthening in managing rail operations and preparation of the MRT and multimodal \ntransport network integration plan. ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "4  Appendix 1         \n \n  COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
