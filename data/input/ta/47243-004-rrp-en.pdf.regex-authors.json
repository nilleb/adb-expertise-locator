THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Rural Connectivity Improvement Project. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of the \nBangladesh Rural Road Sector for Sustainable Development, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n2.  The project will improve the road network connecting the rural population to agriculture \nvalue chain development zones. Investments will be made to (i) upgrade about 1,700 kilometers \n(km) of rural roads to all-weather standards in 34 districts located in five divisions, (ii) improve the \ncapacity of the rural infrastructure agency to address institutional constraints relating to rural road \ndevelopment, and (iii) finance enhancements to the country\u2019s rural road master plan to enable the \nselection of priority rural roads for improvement using a geographic information system covering \nthe entire country.1   \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bangladesh, with a population of about 166 million in 2018 and a land area of 147,570 \nsquare kilometers, is among the most densely populated countries in the world, and one of the \ncountries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Two-thirds of the country is less than \n5  meters  above  mean  sea  level  and  located  in  the  Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra\u2013Meghna  Delta. \nBangladesh has made steady economic progress over the past 6 years since 2012, with annual \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeding 6% on average. In July 2015, Bangladesh \nsurpassed lower-middle income threshold.2 The government\u2019s Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020 is crafted to sustain the economic growth momentum, aiming to achieve a growth rate of \nat least 7% on average over the plan period.3 It is on track to meet this target, having achieved \nan annual GDP growth rate of 7.1% in 2016 and 7.3% in 2017. Moving forward, the Asian \nDevelopment Outlook report on global economic prospects forecasts that Bangladesh will grow \nat an average of 7.7% over FY2018\u2013FY2019 with strong domestic demand and strengthening \nexports. The report projects that investments will benefit from low interest rates and improved \ninfrastructure.4 \n4.  About 80% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas and depends on agriculture for \ntheir  livelihood.  The  rural  economy,  through  the  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors,  substantially \ncontributes to the national economy. Agriculture constituted about 15.5% of GDP in 2015, which \nis in the same range as that of South Asia as a whole. Although the share of agriculture in GDP \nhas been declining gradually, the agriculture sector still employs, directly or indirectly, about 50% \nof the workforce and is a major contributor to reducing poverty because of rising wages. Growth \nin agriculture was between 3.0% and 3.5% from 2000 to 2015. The country has achieved near \nself-sufficiency in cereal production with a strong emphasis on rice production, which is rising \nabove the population growth rate. Agriculture development is necessary to further reduce the \nreliance on imported food and other agricultural products, which absorbs 29% of export earnings. \nThe  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020  focuses  on  increasing  rural  incomes  and \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to economic development by (i) maintaining self-sufficiency in cereal \nproduction, (ii) diversifying and improving the quality of crops, (iii) increasing productivity, and \n                                                 \n1  Chattogram, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Rangpur divisions.  \n2  World Bank.

Bangladesh\u2019s major agricultural challenges include (i) the lack of \nmodern production technologies, (ii) inadequate food quality, (iii) weak value chains, and (iv) food \ninsecurity.  Insufficient  rural  transport,  inadequate  market  infrastructure,  and  the  impacts  of \nintensifying floods and cyclones related to climate change are major constraints to agriculture \ndevelopment.  Accordingly,  the  plan  has  put  forward  specific  strategies  to  overcome  these \nchallenges and constraints. \n5.  Rural connectivity underpins rural development in Bangladesh. Roads are the dominant \nmode of transportation, utilized by over 70% of passengers and 60% of freight traffic. Rural roads \ncontribute  significantly  to  generating  increased  agricultural  incomes  and  employment \nopportunities while providing access to economic and social services to the entire rural population. \nThe road network of Bangladesh consists of (i) highways and district roads owned and maintained \nby the Roads and Highways Department, and (ii) rural roads owned and maintained by the Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED). Bangladesh\u2019s total road network spans 374,245 \nkm, of which 352,943 km (94%) are rural roads. Many of these rural roads were constructed \nduring 1990\u20132010 on earthen embankments. Since 1995, the government, with support from the \ninternational development community, has been expanding and improving the rural road network. \nHowever, rural connectivity in Bangladesh remains unfinished, impeding physical and economic \naccess. Only about 40% of the rural population has access to all-weather roads, and these roads \nmake up only 28% of the total length of rural roads in the country. \n6.  The Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020 aims to expand the rural road capacity to \nincrease connectivity, provide greater access to social services and markets, and promote the \nagriculture sector. The government\u2019s agricultural strategy under the plan also intends to increase \nagricultural  productivity,  encourage  commercial  agriculture  and  agribusiness  development, \nincrease employment opportunities for rural poor people, and reduce the poverty level. Guided \nby the plan, the government has embarked on a sustained effort to improve the country\u2019s rural \nroad network, using its own resources and with assistance from its international development \npartners. The government has proposed to increase the percentage of rural roads classified as \ngood from 43% in 2016 to 80% in 2020.5 The project will support this plan by improving about \n1,700 km of rural roads to all-weather standards, serving the agriculture sector and 51.5 million \nrural people living in 34 districts in five divisions. These roads are critical for supporting the \ncountry\u2019s agriculture value chain development zones. All the project-financed rural roads have \nbeen selected from the rural road master plan through robust selection criteria, and have been \nassessed as priority. The selection criteria took into consideration the population size, each \ndistrict\u2019s agricultural potential, the number of agricultural farms and commercial establishments, \neconomic potential, access to education facilities, and flood-damaged roads. In response to a \nrequest from the government on 3 October 2017, roads that were damaged by flashfloods in 2017 \nwill be prioritized.6 While the government resources for rural road improvement is increasing, the \nfunding gap is still large. It is therefore important to develop a system of road prioritization for an \noptimized rural road network planning. The project will support enhancements to the rural road \nmaster plan.7  \n7.  The  project  will  also  support  the  government\u2019s  commitment  in  the  2017  Vientiane \nDeclaration on Sustainable Rural Transport to promote inclusive, affordable, accessible, and \n                                                 \n5  Good roads comprise both all-weather (paved) and gravel roads. \n6  In 2017, successive heavy rains triggered flashfloods that damaged about 7,000 km of rural roads.  \n7  Under the ongoing ADB-funded TA Bangladesh: Updating the Road Master Plan, the government is updating the \nroad master plan to cover highways and rural roads. The proposed project will build on this output, focusing on \ndeveloping a comprehensive rural road master plan using a geographic information system for road prioritization. \n ", "3 \n \nsustainable rural transport infrastructure and services.8 It is aligned with the country partnership \nstrategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that intends to \npromote all-weather access to markets and agribusiness logistics.9 The project is also included \nin the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Bangladesh.10 \n8.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project builds on the experience and success of \nADB-supported  rural  road  programs  in  India,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka,  which  highlighted  the \nimportance of (i) strengthening institutional capacity, (ii) designing rural roads to all-weather \nstandards with climate-resilient and safety features, (iii) using high-level technology to enhance \nroad master planning, and (iv) improving road maintenance.11 The project roads will adopt climate \nresilient  designs  for  (i)  road  elevations  and  cross  and  side  drainage,  (ii)  road  bases  and \npavements, (iii) earthworks and compaction, and (iv) quality control. This project will utilize \n(i) slope protection using bioengineering approaches, (ii) rigid pavements of reinforced concrete \nat submersible road sections leading to cyclone shelters, and (iii) adequate cross and side \ndrainage. These measures will significantly reduce the ensuing burden of maintaining roads. In \naddition, civil works contracts for the project roads will include a provision for post-completion \nmaintenance for 5 years to assess the efficacy of adopting long-term maintenance by the private \nsector in Bangladesh and to encourage its use, where appropriate. The possible benefits of long-\nterm maintenance include better life cycle quality assurance and greater operational efficiency, \nwhich can further justify budget allocation for rural road maintenance.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impact: connectivity between rural communities, \nproductive agricultural areas, and socioeconomic centers in Bangladesh improved (footnote 3). \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  transport  efficiency  and  related  employment \ngenerated in target areas increased.12 \nC.  Outputs  \n10.  Output 1: Rural road conditions between selected rural communities, productive \nagricultural areas, and socioeconomic centers improved. The condition of about 1,700 km of \nrural  roads  among  the  selected  rural  communities,  productive  agricultural  areas,  and \nsocioeconomic centers will be improved to all-weather standards with climate resilience and \nsafety features.13 The roads will also be covered under contractual maintenance for 5 years after \n                                                 \n8  United Nations Centre for Regional Development. 2017.

The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.21 The principal benefits considered in the \nanalysis are transport cost savings for vehicle operating costs and travel time savings for the \nexisting and incremental flow of people and goods over the analysis period. The economic \nanalysis indicated that the project is economically viable overall, with an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 18.3% and with all individual road packages having an economic internal rate of return \nabove the acceptable rate of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that with a 10% increase in \ncapital costs or a 10% decrease in benefits, the overall investment remains economically viable.  \n22.  Financial sustainability. LGED is primarily responsible for the maintenance of the rural \nroad network. LGED\u2019s budget allocation for rural road maintenance has been increasing by 15.6% \nper year on average since 2013, from about $95 million in 2012\u20132013 to $185 million in 2017\u2013\n2018.  LGED  has  a  well-established  maintenance  planning  and  budget  allocation  system. \nHowever, only about 20% of the estimated requirement for rehabilitation and maintenance of all \nroads is allocated in LGED\u2019s budget for each year. Most rural roads were constructed during \n1990\u20132010. Because of a shortage of funds, there is a significant backlog in maintenance works \nfor  rural  roads.  To  address  this,  the  government  launched  the  Rural  Roads  and  Bridge \nMaintenance Policy in 2013. The policy commits the government to fund road maintenance on an \nincremental basis. The government has also recently introduced a Medium-Term Expenditure \nFramework Statement and the concept of 3-year rolling targets for expenditure indicators to \nprovide greater certainty for multiyear budgeting and the predictability of resources for prioritized \nschemes. \n23.  ADB\u2019s work on improving the roads will further reduce the backlog. Other development \npartners such as the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank are also funding similar interventions. \nTogether they will help sustain rural road maintenance and prevent the roads from going into \ndisrepair and incurring more costly reconstruction. The project will include pilot maintenance in \ncivil works contracts for 5 years in five districts to encourage LGED to adopt maintenance \ncontracts in future projects to ensure better asset quality and improved maintenance. The project \nwill also strengthen the maintenance planning and asset management through the attached TA. \nC.  Governance \n24.  Institutional. LGED, under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives, is responsible for assisting local governments in the districts with civil engineering \naspects, including construction. Its mandate includes planning rural roads, irrigation, and river \ncontrol and constructing bridges, houses, and buildings under the ministry in coordination with \nlocal authorities. LGED is headed by a chief engineer who reports to the secretary of the ministry. \nLGED is experienced in implementing projects funded by development partners such as ADB, \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. \n25.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  LGED  has \nimplemented 28 ADB projects, and 7 projects are ongoing. The department has a dedicated \nfinance section with sufficient staff and adequate capacity in financial accounting and ADB \ndisbursement procedures. However, as project implementation is widely spread to district offices, \na new fund flow and monitoring scheme will be adopted to address potential risks of fund \nmismanagement in the districts. In addition, mitigation measures will be implemented in other risk \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nareas such as staffing, training, and internal auditing. A full-time financial management expert will \nbe engaged to assist the capacity building of LGED. \n26.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The assessment of the procurement \ncapacity of LGED concluded that it has the capacity to undertake procurement activities under \nthe  project.  The  government  will  publish  project  information  on  LGED\u2019s  website,  including \nbusiness opportunities associated with the project. In October 2012, a National Integrity Strategy \nwas approved and a National Integrity Advisory Committee was formed\u2014chaired by the Prime \nMinister\u2014to  oversee  the  anticorruption  activities  and  implement  the  strategy.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 15). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n27.  Poverty reduction and social impact. The project covers 34 districts with a population \nof 51.5 million. Household surveys carried out in the project area reveal that the major income \nsources  are  agricultural  produce,  trade  and  business,  services,  and  overseas  workers\u2019 \nremittances. Poverty and social assessments have been conducted, consulting about 7,835 \npeople living in the project area. The beneficiaries indicated that the project will increase economic \nand employment opportunities. The project will generate an estimated 3.13 million person-days \nof employment over the construction and maintenance periods. \n28.  Gender. The poverty and social analysis included a gender assessment, with 2,418 \nwomen consulted in the project area. Overall, women were supportive of the project because it \nwill give them potential access to economic opportunities and services. The project is categorized \neffective gender mainstreaming. The prepared gender action plan includes the following activities: \n(i) target at least 40% of women participants in project orientation seminars and in the planning \nof project roads; (ii) target at least 20% of women workers to be employed in road improvement \nworks; (iii) conduct awareness training on gender-based violence, human trafficking, and the \nprevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, to at least 40% of students, \nteachers, parents, and school management committees along the project roads; (iv) implement \ncore labor standards with gender-inclusive provisions and women-friendly work environments; \nand (v) conduct road safety awareness programs to at least 40% of students, teachers, parents, \nand school management committees along the project roads. Gender experts will be hired to \nensure effective implementation of the gender action plan. \n29.  Sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. The proportion of the project \nthat requires large and non-local construction workforce is low. Therefore, the risk of spreading \ncommunicable diseases, including STIs, is low. LGED will ensure that civil work contractors \ndisseminate information at worksites on the risks of STIs. The civil work contractors will carry out \nawareness sessions, which national gender experts will monitor, on STIs and human trafficking \nfor their laborers at worksites. \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.22 \n                                                 \n22  ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n ", "9 \n \n31.  Environment (category B). Impacts from all 216 roads were screened and assessed \nusing an environmental checklist developed in similar projects (footnote 11) and adapted to local \nconditions and road designs.23 From these environmental checklists, a single initial environmental \nexamination report was prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. All 216 project \nroads exist, and no by-passes or land acquisitions are anticipated. Most of the negative impacts \nare coterminous with the construction stage, site-specific, limited within the construction corridor, \nand easily mitigated. The anticipated environmental impacts include the generation of dust, noise, \nexhausts from haul trucks and hot mix plants; waste from construction and worker camps; water \ncontamination;  and  occupational  health  and  safety  hazards.  Mitigation  measures  for  all \nanticipated impacts have been developed and integrated into construction works by incorporating \na standard environmental management plan in the bidding documents and providing road-specific \nenvironmental  management  plans  in  the  detailed  project  reports.  An  integrated  social  and \nenvironmental grievance redress mechanism has been formed to continue receiving feedback \nand complaints from affected parties and addressing them during the construction and operation \nstages. The initial environmental examination was disclosed on the ADB and LGED websites. \n32.   Involuntary resettlement (category C). The construction will be carried out mostly within \nexisting road corridors and rights-of-way, with minor widening for road safety in some cases, \nwhich will require narrow strips of land (less than 5% of total holdings) to be made available. Due \ndiligence identified no major impacts to land and no displacement of structures, private trees, or \ncommunity resource properties. A grievance redress mechanism will be set up in all project areas. \nVoluntary land donation may be used when land is required. Specific procedural requirements for \nland donation, involving comprehensive consultations with the communities, have been included \nin the community participation framework,24 which was developed in similar projects (footnote 11). \nThe government will ensure that land donation is carried out without coercion and documented in \na  transparent  manner  and  will  have  the  process  verified  by  an  independent  monitor.  The \ncommunity participation framework was disclosed on the ADB website and includes a mitigation \nmeasures matrix, which details the type of support provided for all types of losses, including \nspecial assistance for vulnerable households. Social safeguards experts will be engaged to \ncontinue community consultations during implementation, redress grievances, and monitor social \nsafeguards. \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will improve existing road corridors and \nrights-of-way, so it will have no impact on culture, human rights, or livelihood systems. The social \nassessment did not identify the presence of tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities in \nany of the project roads. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n34.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak decentralized financial  A new fund flow scheme will be implemented to ensure compliance with \nmanagement  ADB\u2019s disbursement policy; the project management unit will monitor \ncompliance periodically.
