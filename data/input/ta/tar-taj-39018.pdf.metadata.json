During  the  2005  Country  Programming  Mission  for  Tajikistan,  a  Tax  Administration \nModernization and Governance Enhancement Project (Project) and an accompanying advisory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  were  programmed  for  2007,  with  a  project  preparatory  TA \nprogrammed for 2005 to prepare the Project and TA. The TA concept paper was endorsed by \nthe Management of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 27 April 2005. A TA Fact-Finding \nMission visited Tajikistan during 30 May\u20133 June 2005 and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the TA impact, outcomes, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and \noutline terms of references for consulting services. The TA design and monitoring framework \nand the problem analysis are in Appendixes 1 and 2.1  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Reforms and modernization of tax administration is an integral part of the Government \nstrategy to promote private sector-led development and effectively mobilize public resources for \npoverty reduction and sustained economic growth. Tax collection contributes to half of the \nGovernment revenue. Therefore, an efficient and transparent tax administration supports the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy through (i) improved governance, and (ii) increased \npublic resources for basic social services, which are two strategic pillars of the poverty reduction \nstrategy.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  attached  as  Appendix  3. \nDevelopment of an efficient and transparent tax administration will also reinforce the ongoing \ncustoms modernization supported by ADB and thus contribute to the government\u2019s long-term \ngoal of providing integrated customs and tax services through institutional reforms and the use \nof information and communications technology (ICT).  \n \n3.  A four-pronged strategy was adopted by the Government to address the constraints and \nchallenges confronting tax administration and set the enabling environment for modernization \nand  infrastructure  development:  (i)  Tax  Code  reforms  and  functional  reorganization  of  tax \nadministration,  (ii)  business  process  reengineering  to  reduce  administrative  costs  and \ncompliance cost for taxpayers, (iii) reorientation of relationship with taxpayers and improvement \nof  staff  morale,  and  (iv)  implementation  of  a  unified  (or  integrated)  information  system  to \nmodernize tax services infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Much has been achieved in the reform of the tax legal framework and institutional \nstructure. In 2002, the State Tax Committee and State Customs Committee were merged and \nbecame two major departments of a newly established Ministry of State Revenues and Duties \n(MSRD). This measure enables the Government to take a holistic approach in reforms and \nmodernization of revenue administration, and institutionally prepare for integration of tax and \ncustoms services through ICT.  \n \n5.  ADB has been the leading institution supporting customs reforms and modernization for \nTajikistan, providing a program loan in 2002 to support legal and institutional reforms and a \nproject loan and TA in 2004 to support modernization of customs services through ICT and \ncustoms border-post infrastructure development. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) supported tax legal and institutional reforms during the same period, \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 March 2005. \n ", "2   \nproviding long-term advisory services for the revision of the Tax Code and reorganization of tax \nadministration along functional lines rather than on the type of taxes collected.  \n \n6.  The revised Tax Code was adopted by the Parliament in September 2004 and became \neffective on 1 January 2005. The revised Tax Code has simplified tax procedures, rationalized \nthe tax regime, and introduced measures to broaden the base. Major changes are (i) elimination \nof nuisance taxes (e.g., tax holidays) and reduction of the list of tax concessions and exemption; \n(ii) an increase in the threshold of the value-added tax registration; (iii) a simplified tax regime, \nparticularly for small private enterprises and agriculture business; (iv) strengthened audit and \nenforcement functions of MSRD; (v) recognition of taxpayers\u2019 rights; and (vi) necessary legal \nprovisions for the use of ICT for tax filing and collection.  \n \n7.  Reorganization of tax administration along a functional line started in January 2005 with \nadvisory support from USAID. These achievements have provided a legal and institutional \nfoundation  for  modernizing  tax  services  to  improve  efficiency  and  governance  of  tax \nadministration. Additionally, pilot-testing of a taxpayer registration system in one district of the \ncity of Dushanbe was conducted with support from USAID. The pilot system allows taxpayers in \nDushanbe district to receive computer-generated taxpayer identification numbers when they \nregister. It is the first step toward modernization of customs services through ICT. However, the \nsystem has yet to be extended to other districts and tax offices due to lack of budget provision \nfor the initiative. \n \n8.  With USAID supporting functional reorganization and development of implementation \nprocedures of the new Tax Code, ADB will complement USAID\u2019s effort by focusing its support \non three other strategic priorities: business process reengineering, enhanced client orientation \nof  tax  services  through  training  and  consultation,  and  development  of  ICT  and  physical \ninfrastructure for tax services.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project preparatory TA is enhanced revenue collection and improved \nefficiency and governance of tax administration. The impact also includes (i) uniform application \nof  the  revised  Tax  Code  through  support  for  MSRD\u2019s  training-of-trainers  program,  and  (ii) \nenhanced  awareness  of  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  from  customs  modernization \nthrough external training.  \n \n10.  The main outcome of the TA will be a project design suitable for ADB financing. The TA \noutputs include (i) detailed assessments and project design; (ii) a functional ICT classroom to \nsupport the training-of-the trainers program for dissemination of the revised Tax Code and \nimprovement of ICT literacy; and (iii) an external training seminar to distill best practices and \nlessons learned from tax administration modernization. Training on ADB procedures will also be \nprovided to support project implementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.  The assessments and the project design will be carried out in close consultation with the \nexecuting  agency,  relevant  Government  agencies,  and  private  sector  stakeholders.  This \nmethodology will ensure the project design takes into account the views and concerns of key \n ", "  3\nstakeholders and there is broad-based support for the modernization efforts. Development of a \ntraining and change management program is a key activity of the TA. Development of a set of \nperformance indicators will be another key activity to ensure that the Project is result-oriented \nand its intended development impact is measurable. The performance indicators will be agreed \nupon with the executing agency upon the conclusion of the assessment. Business processing \nreengineering will be carried out before the architectural and technical design of the information \nsystem for tax services; this will ensure that ICT will computerize the streamlined business \nprocess, and ICT will be an agent of change in support of the broad modernization effort. The \nTA activities and the scope of the assessments are summarized below. \n \n1.  Assessments and Project Design \n12.  Business Process Reengineering. This subcomponent includes a review of the work \nflows in light of recent changes in the Tax Code and regulations, and development of a detailed \nplan to reengineer the key business processes (e.g., collection, assessment, and enforcement) \nand the supporting processes (e.g., accounting and disputes settlements). \n \n13.  ICT Plan. The ICT plan includes (i) assessment of the existing use of ICT, and detailed \ndesign of an information system for tax services (i.e., the architecture, core application systems \nand  supporting  systems,  detailed  functional  and  technical  specifications,  and  data  and \napplication interfaces with relevant agencies); and (ii) an investment plan providing detailed cost \nestimates,  performance  indicators,  procurement  package,  implementation  schedule,  and \nmaintenance plan.  \n \n14.  Physical Infrastructure Development Plan. The plan will include assessing the current \nphysical conditions of the tax administration headquarters and priority tax offices (e.g., Large \nTaxpayers\u2019  Office) and district offices (e.g., Dushanbe and Khudzhand); and developing a \nphysical  infrastructure  plan  to  complement  the  implementation  of  the  information  system \nthrough refurbishment of buildings and construction of storage rooms for protection of tax \ndocuments and ICT equipment.  \n \n15.  Training and Change Management Program. This subcomponent includes assessing \nthe training needs to support the tax modernization effort, developing a training and change \nmanagement program to help tax officers meet the challenges of tax modernization and adapt \nto the changed work environment, and supporting MSRD management to manage the changes. \n \n2.  Provision of Equipment for a Training Classroom \n16.  This component will provide a modest amount of financial assistance for purchase of \nteaching equipment to support MSRD\u2019s training-of-trainers program. The training program aims \nto disseminate information on the newly approved Tax Code to ensure its uniform interpretation \nand application, and improve ICT literacy of tax officers.  \n \n3.  External Seminar on Tax Reforms and Modernization \n17.  The TA will sponsor international training for selected officials of the tax administration to \ngain international best practices, and share experiences and lessons learned with tax officers of  \nthe host country. The assessment and the project design will be presented in the seminar to \nseek comments and suggestions from host country tax officers. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising $410,000 in foreign \nexchange cost and $190,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide to Tajikistan, on a \ngrant basis, $500,000 equivalent from the ADB-funded TA program, to finance the entire foreign \nexchange  cost,  and  $90,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government\u2019s \ncontribution of $100,000 equivalent will cover office accommodations, provision of support staff, \nlocal communication, and logistic support for workshops and seminars. Details of the cost \nestimates are in Appendix 4. MSRD and the Ministry of Finance are advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MSRD will be the Executing Agency, and the Tax Department of MSRD will be the \nImplementing Agency. The TA will start in September 2005 and be completed by June 2007. All \nequipment to be purchased under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  The  mode  of  procurement  will  be  direct  purchase  as  the  total  costs  of \nequipment to be procured will be less than $100,000. The equipment will be retained by the Tax \nDepartment after the completion of the TA. An advance payment facility will be established, as \nworkshops/training/seminars require funds prior to the conduct of the events.  \n \n20.  Tentatively, the TA will finance 15 person-months international and 29 person-months \ndomestic consulting services. The proposed international and domestic consultants (person-\nmonths are in parentheses) will include specialists in (i) business process reengineering and \nchange management for tax administration (6 international and 10 domestic), (ii) ICT for tax \nservices (6 international and 9 domestic), (iii) civil engineering for rehabilitation and construction \nof office buildings (8 domestic), (iv) project management (2 international), and (v) financial \nmanagement (1 international and 2 domestic). The outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin Appendix 5. \n \n21.  In consultation with MSRD, ADB will select and engage a qualified firm of international \nconsultants  with  domestic  associates  to  provide  services  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of \nreference  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  the  Biodata  Technical \nProposals, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will work closely with \nthe MSRD, relevant agencies and institutions, private sector stakeholders, and ADB staff. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Republic of Tajikistan for preparing the Tax Administration Modernization \nand Governance Enhancement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact  Ratio of administrative  Ministry of State Revenues  Assumptions \nEnhanced revenue  costs to the tax revenue  and Duties\u2019 (MSRD\u2019s)  \u2022  Government is \ncollection, and  collected in selected  internal and published  committed to tax \nimproved efficiency and  project districts has  reports  administration reform \ngovernance in tax  improved compared    and modernization \nadministration  with the national  Government statistics on  \u2022  MSRD is committed to \n  average or in districts  gross national products  training and change \nnot benefiting from the  management as an \nProject.  integral part of the \n  modernization plan. \nRevenue collection as a  \u2022  Project and technical \npercentage of gross  assistance (TA) are \ndomestic product  implemented as \n(GDP) increases  scheduled. \ncompared with the   \nbaseline. \nOutcome  The Government and  Memorandum of  Risks \nProject and TA design  Asian Development  Understanding  \u2022  The project design is not \nagreed with the  Bank (ADB) sign the    suitable for ADB \nGovernment  Memorandum of  Back-to-office reports  financing. \n  Understanding upon  \u2022  ADB and the \nthe conclusion of the  Government could not \nfact-finding and  reach agreement on the \nappraisal missions.  project design, \ncounterpart fund \nrequirement, and \nimplementation \narrangements.  \nOutputs  Final report is  TA progress report  Assumptions \n1.

Therefore, an efficient and transparent tax \nadministration supports the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy through (i) improved governance; and (ii) \nincreased public resources for basic social services, which are two strategic pillars of the poverty reduction strategy.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Proposed Poverty Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Strategy and Program paper for Tajikistan demonstrates that the \nbreakup of the former Soviet Union and the consequent economic decline led to a substantial increase in the \nincidence of poverty in the country. \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \nPoverty increased dramatically in Tajikistan after 1991 with the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The World Bank's \npoverty assessment, the only comprehensive one available, estimates that over 80% of the 1999 population lived \nbelow the poverty line. Poverty is more pronounced in rural than in urban areas with 81% of the poor estimated to be \nliving in rural areas. Nonincome poverty indicators are also worrisome. Families with many children and old people \nliving alone have the highest risk of poverty. Many male breadwinners died in the civil war, leaving behind destitute \nfamilies with female heads that account for almost 30% of the poor.                 \n                                   \nThe major causes of poverty in Tajikistan are (i) a decline in output, wage levels, and employment resulting from the \ncollapse of the former Soviet Union; (ii) severance of central subsidies and fiscal adjustment, which reduced the poor\u2019s \naccess to vital social services, health, education, and heating; and (iii) rising inequality. \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement signed in December 2002 is consistent with the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction \nStrategy Paper (PRSP) approved by Parliament in June 2002. The PRSP sets out the short-term (2002\u20132005), \nmedium-term (2002\u20132007), and long-term (2002\u20132015) goals for poverty reduction in Tajikistan, and identifies three \nstrategic pillars of poverty reduction: (i) sustained high economic growth, (ii) improved governance, and (iii) improved \naccess to social services, in part through better targeting. The Government set up in May 2003 the PRSP Monitoring \nDepartment under the Office of the President to lead in monitoring and evaluating PRSP implementation. With ADB \nassistance, the State Statistics Commission established the capacity to conduct periodic reviews of poverty for public \ndissemination. The PRSP Progress Report for the First Year presented by the Government in February 2004 noted \nthe decline of poverty incidence. However, to a certain extent this stems from remittances from migrant workers rather \nthan from inclusive economic growth inside the country. Both the Government and the international development \ninstitutions recognize that it is a long-term endeavor to assist Tajikistan to achieve the goals set in the PRSP.  \n \nC.
