INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Armenia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide  \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to prepare city development/investment plans \n(CDPs) in the four secondary cities: Gyumri, Vanadzor, Dilijan, and Jermuk. The government \nand ADB approved the Sustainable Urban Development Investment Program in 2011 to finance \npriority infrastructure projects in urban areas of Armenia for a total amount of $400 million \nequivalent. The first tranche for $50 million will finance projects in Yerevan. The subsequent \ntranches to be approved in 2013 and onward will mainly focus on secondary cities. The CDPs \nwill focus on key development and policy challenges related to urban sectors including urban \ntransport,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  district  heating,  housing, \neconomic development, logistics, tourism, and lighting. The CDPs will span a 10-year period \nand will specify and prioritize a list of urban investment projects and improvements in the \nselected cities within the city development/investment plan. \n \n2.  ADB agreed with the government on the objectives and scope of the TA, the terms of \nreference for the consultants, and the cost and implementation arrangements. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Being a landlocked country, Armenia\u2019s economic development is tied to the construction \nof  transborder  infrastructure  linking  its  economy  to  export  markets  and  to  strengthening \neconomic poles able to generate positive spin-offs for its surrounding territory. Unbalanced \neconomic growth among regions poses serious development challenges to planners and policy \nmakers in Armenia. Some cities are growing fast; others are not. Some house only one industry \nat best while others struggle to attract one. A gradual collapse of its heavy industry in the early \n1990s created a rapid shift in the location of commercial and residential centers throughout the \ncountry and corresponding changes in the demand for urban and transport network services. \nThese changes have led to poor urban services management, traffic, congestion, loss of green \nareas, poor air quality, noise, and degraded historical buildings in many cities.  \n \n4.  As urban areas are the pillars of Armenia\u2019s economic growth and home to 2.1 million \npeople (64% of the total country population), the government\u2019s objective is to offer balanced and \nsustainable economic and territorial development that will (i) boost economic growth and job \ncreation,  (ii)  stimulate  private  sector  investment,  and  (iii)  rebalance  development  between \nYerevan  and  participating  cities.2 These  cities  generate  almost  90%  of  the  nation\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product  and  represent  three-quarters  of  the  urban  population.  The  government\u2019s \nstrategic orientation revolves around the north\u2013south corridor and focuses on: \n(i)  bolstering Yerevan as the country\u2019s engine of growth and improving connection \nto  the  neighboring  countries,  with  infrastructure  designed  according  to \ninternational standards (British Standard, Deutsche Normen, American Society \nfor Testing and Material); \n(ii)  establishing Gyumri, Vanadzor, and Kapan as the three main trade gateways of \nArmenia by strengthening the economic and social clusters already identified to \noffer alternative centers of growth; \n(iii)  strengthening the agribusiness cluster of the four medium cities of Astashat, \nArarat, Ashtarat, and Armavir; and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 February 2013.  \n2  ADB. 2012. Managing Urban Armenia. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (RETA 6423).   \n ", "2   \n(iv)  improving accessibility and accelerating development of the four cities of Jermuk, \n  Dilijan, Tsakhkadzor, and Sevan, which have high tourism development potential. \n \n5.  Institutional arrangements and strategic planning have been addressed in the water \nsupply sector, and the expertise of the private sector was tapped, but there is still a lot to do in \ntransport and waste management.  \n \n6.  The quality of urban services in Armenia is low, mainly because of poor performance of \nthe existing services, lack of strategic or integrated planning, and weak enforcement of the law. \nThe financial sustainability of services is therefore ineffective, implying high operating costs and \nhigher tariffs. \n \n7.  Ongoing infrastructure development and development partner assistance is important in \nArmenia, with 10 projects being financed from development partners like the World Bank, the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and KfW, mainly in transport and water, \nfor a total value of about $230 million, excluding those projects financed by ADB. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE   \n8.  This  TA  will  help  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE)  and  the  Ministry  of  Territorial \nAdministration (MTA) prepare CDPs over a 10-year period for four secondary cities. These \ncities are Gyumri, Jermuk, Vanadzor and Dilijan and some of the identified projects within the \ncity development/investment plans may be considered by the government to seek funding \nsupport including from ADB. The TA will address the government\u2019s strategic orientation to \nimprove economic growth by developing cities along trade gateways and those with tourism \npotential.  It  will  eventually  inform  the  government  growth  strategy  and  facilitate  balanced \ndevelopment in the country. It will focus on key development and policy challenges related to \nthe  urban  sector,  including  urban  transport,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste \nmanagement, district heating, housing, economic development, logistics, tourism, and street \nlighting; and help list and prioritize urban investment projects in the selected cities. This TA will \ninclude such prioritized project list. The detailing (detailed engineering, feasibility study, or due \ndiligence) of  projects would not be part of the scope of this TA. This TA will also help MOE and \nMTA design the best organizational arrangement to implement urban and municipal projects in \nparticipating cities. It will define the organization, prepare job descriptions and the operational \nbudget, and underline the coordination mechanisms between national and local governments to \nensure successful implementation. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved urban and municipal infrastructure in the four \ncities  of  Gyumri,  Jermuk,  Vanadzor,  and  Dilijan.  The  outcome  will  be  well-planned  urban \ndevelopment/investment projects in the four cities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will result in the following outputs: (i) diagnostic reports for reference in preparing \nthe CDPs; (ii) a 10-year city strategic vision, city development/investment plan based on each \ncity\u2019s financial situation endorsed; (iii) an exhibition on CDPs for Gyumri, Jermuk, Vanadzor, and \nDilijan conducted; and (iv) prioritized project list for the four secondary cities completed. \n \n ", "  3 \n11.  The assumptions are as follows: (i) the government pursues strategy for growth and \nkeep secondary cities as a priority; (ii) political and economic stability exists at the national and \nlocal levels; (iii) environmental and resettlement frameworks applicable for participating cities \nare in place; (iv) the government is willing to borrow for participating cities; (v) the government \nexercises prompt decision making and release of counterpart funds; and (vi) there is a prompt \ndecision on the implementation arrangements for participating cities and support for the capacity \ndevelopment needs of the relevant municipalities. \n \n12.  The risks identified are as follows: local government resources cannot accommodate the \nfinancing  of  the  proposed  investment  plan,  and  weak  coordination  among  government \ndepartments and relevant municipalities undermines sustainable operations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $739,200, of which $660,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership \nFacility,3 and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form \nof counterpart staff, office space, space for workshops, and other in-kind contributions. The \nvalue of government contribution is estimated to account for 12% of the total TA cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The MTA as executing agency will implement the TA with the support of the Ministry for \nUrban Development (MUD). The team of consultants will be hosted in the offices of the MTA.  \n \n15.  For the duration of the TA implementation period, MTA will be staffed with permanent \npersonnel including a project director, an English-speaking coordinator, and counterpart staff \nwho  will  work  in  coordination  with  the  consultants,  government  agencies,  and  other \nstakeholders. A steering committee chaired by MTA, with representatives from MUD,  MOE, \neach city, and other stakeholders will meet at least once a month to provide strategic direction \nfor the selection of investment proposals and the financing plan as part of the prioritized project \nlist.  \n \n16.  Two types of consultants will be recruited under the TA: a group of individual consultants, \nand one local communication and marketing agency. The team of individual consultants will \ncomprise seven international individual consultants supported by three national consultants. \nThey  will  be  recruited  through  ADB\u2019s  Consultant  Management  System  and  will  cover  the \nfollowing expertise: urban planning, urban infrastructure, urban financing, institutional, economic \ndevelopment, economic analysis, tourism, and cultural heritage development. They will prioritize \na project list in the four secondary cities. Consultants will be recruited in line with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All disbursements \nunder  the  technical  assistance  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from May 2013 to September 2015. \n \n \n \n                                                \n3  Contributor: the Government of Sweden.  \n ", "4   \nIV.
