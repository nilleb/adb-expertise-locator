INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) project will support implementation of the Asia-\nPacific  Climate  Finance  Fund  (ACliFF),  a  multidonor  trust  fund  approved  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on 28 April 2017.1 The fund will support the assessment, development, \nand provision of financial risk management products that can help increase financing for climate \ninvestments and improve resilience to the impacts of climate change. The TA fulfills part of ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to support the fund\u2019s implementation,2 as reflected in the approved annual work plan \nof the Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Thematic Group.3 \n \n2.  ACliFF supports activities in line with the strategic priorities identified in the ADB Climate \nChange  Operational  Framework  2017\u20132030:  Enhanced  Actions  for  Low  Greenhouse  Gas \nEmissions and Climate-Resilient Development, approved by the ADB President on 4 July 2017. \nThe operational framework aims to facilitate access by ADB developing member countries (DMCs) \nto public and private, domestic, and international climate finance.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The use of financial risk management products can be critical in helping countries meet \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation challenges, including those outlined in their nationally \ndetermined contributions. Such products are particularly important in addressing risks associated \nwith climate investments in DMCs, which are often held back by real or perceived initial financial \nrisks and transaction costs, reflecting underlying barriers faced by both financiers and end-users \nof finance. These can include unfamiliarity with climate technologies and their performance, \nquality  concerns  related  to  installation  and  maintenance,  regulatory  concerns,  and  other \nuncertainties. Financial risk management products are also important in helping to manage the \nincrease in extreme weather risk associated with climate change. \n \n4.  The availability of relevant financial risk management products\u2014such as technology \nperformance guarantees and weather index-based insurance\u20145 is increasing, but their use and \ndeployment in ADB DMCs remains very low as a result of barriers such as high initial product \ndevelopment costs, data constraints, marketing and distribution channel limitations, uncertainty \nabout market uptake, and low customer awareness and trust.  \n \n5.  It was in response to these issues that ADB approved the establishment of ACliFF, with \nthe objective of supporting the development and implementation of financial risk management \nproducts to help mitigate and manage a range of risks present in climate change actions. ACliFF \nwill support financial risk management products to (i) increase adoption of climate technologies, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Establishment of Asia-Pacific Climate Fund. Manila.  \n2  On 6 May 2017, the ADB vice-president for knowledge management and sustainable development announced a \ncommitment to provide $1 million in TA for ACliFF; $750,000 will be provided by the proposed TA, with the remaining \n$250,000 to be provided by an existing TA project (ADB. Enhancing Readiness of ADB Member Countries for Scaled \nUp  Climate  Finance),  which  will  finance  activities  related  to  market  research  and  ACliFF  management.  \nhttps://www.adb.org/annual-meeting/2017/events/approaches-climate-financing \n3  This TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 September 2017. \n4  ADB. 2017.

ACliFF resources will be used to support the development and implementation of financial \nrisk management products through TA, grants, direct charges, and other instruments, which may \ninclude  loan,  mezzanine,  or  equity  financing.6 Financial  risk  management  products  will  be \ndeployed on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with sovereign and nonsovereign development \nprojects in ADB DMCs. Projects with ADB participation are preferred. The ADB Climate Change \nSteering Committee (CCSC) will authorize the allocation of funds from ACliFF based on project \nproposals submitted for its consideration by the ACliFF fund manager, who will manage ACliFF \nand develop the annual work plans.7 \n \n7.   ACliFF  implementation  can  be  accelerated  by  carrying out  preparatory  activities  to \nenhance operational readiness upon fund capitalization. The proposed TA will support the (i) \nidentification  of  more  clearly  defined  opportunities  for  the  implementation  of  financial  risk \nmanagement products; (ii) development of financial risk management product concepts; (iii) \nincreased awareness (within and external to ADB) of ACliFF\u2019s purpose, mechanisms, and \npotential applications; and (iv) engagement with external parties\u2014including potential financing \npartners and industry experts with relevant technical skills and experience\u2014who could help \nACliFF achieve its objective. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMC climate investment that is supported by \nfinancial risk management products is increased (footnote 1). The TA will have the following \noutcome: integration of financial risk management products in ADB projects strengthened.8 \nB.   Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  Output  1: Gap  analysis  of  supply  and  demand  for financial risk  management \nproducts in selected sectors and applications undertaken. To better understand the issues \nwith respect to financial risk management product supply and demand in ADB DMCs, the project \nteam will conduct supply and demand analyses of selected sectors and applications and highlight \ngaps,  constraints  to,  and  needs  and  opportunities  for  financial  risk  management  product \ndeployment. The team will select sectors and applications according to their (i) current or potential \ncontribution to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation; (ii) relevance across DMCs; (iii) \npotential  for  supporting  ADB  planned  or  pipeline  projects;  and  (iv)  potential  for  mobilizing \n                                                \n6 Activities to be supported by the fund will be identified, designed, processed, approved, and implemented in \naccordance with applicable ADB policies, procedures, and guidelines, including the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), and others relating to consulting services and procurement, disbursement, public disclosure, anticorruption \nand governance, financial management, and reporting. \n7  The director general of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department serves as the CCSC chair; \nmembership comprises (i) the directors general of the ADB operations departments; Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department; and Strategy, Policy and Review Department; and (ii) the head of the Office of \nCofinancing Operations. The CCSC will consult the technical advisors, as needed. Funding for the fund manager \nand consultant positions in the fund management team will be charged to ACliFF. The annual work plan will outline \nplanned key ACliFF activities over the subsequent fiscal year, including projects and financial risk management \nproducts to be supported. The fund manager will develop the annual work plan in close consultation with the CCSC \nfor endorsement by the ACliFF financing partners. \n8 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nadditional climate change mitigation and/or adaptation investments, in particular from the private \nsector. Supply analyses will focus mainly on factors driving the existing and potential future \navailability (commercially or otherwise), pricing, and nature of financial risk management products \nin the selected sectors in ADB DMCs. Demand analyses will address current and potential future \nneeds and calls for financial risk management products based on factors such as types and levels \nof risk exposure, and financial literacy with respect to financial risk management products. Tools \nused for gap analyses will include market research, surveys, literature reviews, and expert and \nstakeholder consultations.  \n \n10.  Initial sectors and applications to be analyzed may include renewable energy, energy \nefficiency, disaster risk insurance pools, and climate-smart agriculture value chains (definitive \nselection of sectors, applications, and DMCs will be based on consultations with operations \ndepartments). At least four supply and demand analyses for financial risk management products \nin selected sectors, applications, and DMCs will be undertaken. \n \n11.  Output 2: Product concept notes prepared. This output will focus on generating  \ndetailed concept notes for financial risk management products; the notes will include (i) a detailed \ndescription of climate investment risks and/or climate risks affecting the related ADB project; (ii) \nan assessment of financial risk management product options to address the identified risk(s) as \npart of an overall risk management strategy, including their financial benefits; (iii) the rationale for \nselecting the proposed financial risk management product(s); (iv) an implementation plan for the \ndevelopment of the proposed financial risk management product(s); and (v) an outline of the \nrequired support, both financial and technical, from ACliFF for the implementation of the financial \nrisk management product. \n \n12.  The project team will develop at least one of the target three financial risk management \nproduct concept notes into a full ACliFF funding proposal for submission to the CCSC. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Knowledge  products  regarding  financial  risk  management  products \nincreased. This output will focus on raising awareness among DMC governments and ADB \nproject counterparts, ADB staff, financiers, insurers and reinsurers, private sector actors, potential \nusers and beneficiary groups, and other key stakeholders on the challenges, opportunities, and \nbenefits of financial risk management products in ADB DMCs. It will include (i) conduct of at least \none regional roundtable forum on various aspects related to the design and implementation of \nfinancial  risk  management  products,  including  mobilization  of  private  sector  investment, \nsupportive policy and legal environments, regional approaches to climate risk management, and \nclimate data availability; (ii) conduct of at least two training workshops on the design and \nintegration of financial risk management products into development projects for ADB staff and \nDMC project counterparts; and (iii) development of at least two knowledge products\u2014such as  \nguidance notes, checklists, or manuals\u2014to help ADB staff design projects that incorporate \nfinancial risk management products eligible for ACliFF support. \n \n14.  Given the importance of building and reinforcing partnerships with DMC governments, \nfinancial institutions, regional centers of excellence, potential ACliFF contributors, and other key \nstakeholders,  the  output  also  includes  activities  related  to  outreach  and  establishment  of \npartnerships, including (i) promotional material on ACliFF, such as brochures describing the \nmechanics and potential benefits of ACliFF support, which will be made publicly available through \n ", "4 \nADB  websites  and  other  knowledge-sharing  platforms;9 and  (ii)  at  least  three  consultation \nmeetings with external partners and experts.10  \n \nC.    Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF), with $745,000 from TASF-other sources and $5,000 \nfrom TASF 6. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.11 \n \nD.    Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement Division of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will lead \nimplementation  within  ADB.  The  project  team  will  seek  government  concurrence  prior  to \nimplementation of any TA activities in DMCs.  \n \n17.  The project team will work closely with ADB operations departments on the selection of \nfinancial risk management products, and generation of the concept notes on the selected financial \nrisk management products. The project team will also support cross-sector and cross-thematic \napproaches  by  working  with  relevant  sector  and  thematic  groups  (e.g.,  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment and food security, energy, environment, finance, social development, transport, \nwater, and urban development) during implementation. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2017\u2013October 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department  \nImplementing agencies  ADB Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant  37 person-months  $551,100 \nselection: individual or \nthrough a firm  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following the ADB Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance.\u2028 \nSources: Approved TA concept paper (ADB. 2017.
