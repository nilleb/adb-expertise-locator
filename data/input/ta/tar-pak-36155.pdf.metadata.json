The Government of Pakistan accords high priority to private participation in infrastructure \n(PPI) to establish and upgrade economic infrastructure and save precious budgetary resources. \nIt has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for help to design and implement the PPI \nSector  Development  Program  (SDP).  While  TA  4154-PAK1  had  emphasized  the  need  to \nestablish a financial institution dedicated to infrastructure along with regulatory and promotional \nentities at the provincial level, the absence of a significant deal flow of infrastructure projects \ninvolving private participation requires a simple and more robust design than the one previously \nproposed.  This  entails  building  capacity  in  the  public  sector  and  in  financial  institutions, \nproviding easy access to a project development facility for all levels of government, and setting \nup a financing facility that complements the funding provided by market sources to enhance the \ncommercial  viability  of  PPI  projects.  The  2005  country  strategy  and  program  for  Pakistan \nincludes technical assistance (TA) for developing the PPI SDP, taking into account the findings \nof the previous TA. A Fact-Finding Mission fielded in September 2005 reached understanding \nwith the Government on the purpose, approach, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference of the TA.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan has shown remarkable success in turning its economy around based on far-\nreaching economic, fiscal, and financial sector reforms. ADB has provided assistance to the \nGovernment\u2019s financial sector, capital markets, and governance reform agenda, and as a result \nof its long-standing relationship with the Government is now engaged in supporting Pakistan\u2019s \nmore  challenging  second-generation  reforms.  These  include  addressing  the  Government\u2019s \ninstitutional  constraints  to  development,  thereby  improving  the  business  environment  and \nincreasing  employment  opportunities.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Plan \n2005\u20142010 recognizes the large backlog of infrastructure investments required in both urban \nand rural areas  to improve Pakistan\u2019s competitiveness, support the business climate, enhance \nemployment, and reduce poverty. Business climate assessments highlight the importance of \naccess to good quality, affordable infrastructure services if private sector businesses are to \nsucceed. Infrastructure entails fixed assets and services related to transport (roads, airports, \nrail, mass transport systems, and ports), water supply and sanitation, solid waste treatment, \neducation, health, and small-scale projects (energy, power, telecommunications, irrigation, and \nwater storage).  \n3.  With economic growth accelerating to an annual rate of 8.4% in FY2005, Pakistan\u2019s \nbusiness climate and confidence has improved considerably since 2000. By June 2005 the \nfiscal deficit had fallen to 3.2% of gross domestic product, and the country\u2019s debt-service ratio \nhas also dropped substantially. Reforms were associated with reduced support for important \nsectors, including the social sectors, and local governance reforms pose challenges pertaining \nto local governments\u2019 capabilities to undertake their functions. \n4.  To further improve debt management, the Government is committed to maintaining \nprudent fiscal management, which limits its ability to borrow. Government estimates indicate \nthat under normal budget allocations, it can only cover less than its investment needs from \nFY2006 to FY2010. Innovative approaches are required to tap private sector resources and to \nfast-track investments that are heavily constrained under the conventional investment planning \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Preparing the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility. Manila. (TA 4154-PAK, approved on 25 July 2003, for $400,000) \n2 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 August 2005.  ", "2   \nand  approval  processes.  Particular  efforts  are  required  to  leverage  the  professional  skills, \nincentives, and financial resources of the private sector in relation to establishing and managing \ninfrastructure. While the Government is keen to mobilize the private sector\u2019s financial resources, \nit  has  so  far  been  unable  to  deal  effectively  with  the  private  sector  and  incentivize  PPI \ntransactions.  \n5.  Since the early 1990s, Pakistan has gained valuable PPI experience in the power, \ntelecommunications, oil and gas, and service sectors. Notable privatization transactions have \ntaken  place  that  highlight  the  need  for  careful  balancing  of  investors\u2019  and  service  users\u2019 \ninterests and for reaching equitable agreements. Issues of concentration of market power, \npricing, service quality, protection of property and users\u2019 rights, and management of foreign \nexchange risks require a consistent separation of the Government\u2019s executive, rule-making, and \nsupervisory  powers.  Pakistan\u2019s  experience  has  shaped  the  development  of  regulatory \nmechanisms, the facilitation of investments, and the provision of financing incentives. A policy \nand regulatory framework has attracted private investors and financiers from Pakistan and \nabroad.  \n6.  A coherent PPI policy and strategy is needed. Unlike in the power, oil and gas, and \ntelecommunications sectors, no coherent policy and institutional framework exists for PPI in \ntransport, water supply and sanitation, and urban development, particularly at the provincial and \nlocal  government  levels.  Policies  need  to  address  complexities  across  various  levels  of \njurisdiction  that  blur  the  assignment  of  ownership  and  accountability  and  the  division  of \nregulatory responsibilities (investor and consumer protection), from service delivery functions, \nand legal enforcement powers of public entities. While Local Government Ordinance 2001 \nassigns accountability to local governments, in practice, agencies at a higher level maintain \nservices. Whether local governments will be able to fulfill the service provider function as \nprescribed by the Local Government Ordinance is uncertain. \n7.  The financial strength and management capacity of provincial, district, and municipal \ngovernments are currently extremely limited and need to be strengthened. Policies are needed \nto improve their financial management; establish independent credit rating in the market, and \nidentification, structuring and development of revenue-earning services.   \n8.  Poor  performance  by  utilities  is  a  result  of  poor  enforcement  of  laws.  Users\u2019  low \nwillingness to pay is directly related to poor service standards and practices. The limited ability \nof public service providers to minimize system losses, collect revenues in a timely fashion, and \ncharge service fees that recover costs indicate the low quality of services provided and the need \nfor professional management. Some agencies do not understand the benefits of PPI, and \nvested interests favor the status quo. It is critical that PPI is well understood and that policy is \ndeveloped in a consultative process. PPI will be used if it is found to be more economically \nviable than public sector solutions and if it increases service coverage and standards. \n9.  The Government largely lacks the ability to prepare, manage, and oversee PPI projects. \nIn addition, because of the absence of regulatory and dispute resolution mechanisms, conflicts \nof  interest  undermine  investors  and  service  users\u2019  confidence.  Finally,  domestic  private \nexpertise in infrastructure project design and management must be nurtured. \n10.  In the past, PPIs in Pakistan have often relied on financing and management by foreign \ninvestors. The 1998 currency crisis highlighted the challenges of transferring revenues outside \nPakistan and of devaluation in relation to utility charges. Currency and maturity mismatches \nbetween foreign currency liabilities and debt service, full dependence on domestic currency \nrevenues,  and  shortages  of  long-term  capital  must  be  addressed  by  developing  long-term \n ", "  3\ndomestic currency markets. This includes tapping the potential of institutional investors (pension \nfunds and insurance companies) to provide long-term funds.  \n11.  Currently,  infrastructure  lending  plays  only  a  minor  role  even  for  larger  financial \ninstitutions.  Important  constraints  within  the  financial  institutions  need  to  be  addressed, \nincluding lending processes that ignore the specifics of project financing and the absence of in-\nhouse  interdisciplinary  skills  in  project  financing.  The  lack  of  long-term  domestic  debt \ninstruments, such as long-term corporate bonds, constrains the asset liability management \nability of financial institutions.  \n12.  The Government recognizes that it needs to develop a consistent PPI policy to address \nthe foregoing constraints and its future support to PPI. Professional support is required to \nensure that PPI transactions are effectively carried out between Government and private sector \ninvestors. Public sector funding is also required to complement and enable financing of the \nmarket, the private sector, and subsovereign entities. The PPI policy and transaction experience \nwill  shape  further  policy  and  institutional  development,  including  regulatory  and  consumer \nprotection functions, financial institutions, and Government capabilities for participating in and \nmanaging  the  PPI  process.  The  rationale  for  the  proposed  PPI  SDP  is  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  through  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nemployment. PPI normally generates substantial benefits in relation to improving the investment \nand business climate. Direct infrastructure investments and the indirect impact of improved \ninfrastructure provision will create economic activity and employment and enhance skills in the \nprivate sector. The TA and the PPI SDP approach fit well into ADB\u2019s support of Pakistan\u2019s \nreforms in the private and financial sectors, capital markets and infrastructure, and governance. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The desired impact of the proposed PPI SDP is to enhance the number, volume, and \nservice quality of infrastructure projects financed and managed through PPI. The objective of \nthe TA is to help the Government and ADB prepare and finalize the design of the PPI SDP and \nto assist the Government in establishing the institutions and some pilot transactions needed to \nfacilitate a seamless transition from design to implementation.  \n14.  The TA will support the development of policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms for \nthe PPI SDP. The PPI SDP is expected to finance the cost of reform, including a portion of the \ncapital endowment for the Infrastructure Fund. The TA will help the Government through the \nestablishment of a task force to (i) develop PPI policies, laws, contract arrangements, and \nregulatory  functions  and  institutions;  (ii)  design  and  establish  the  Infrastructure  Project \nDevelopment Facility (IPDF) as an independent, not-for-profit company operating on a corporate \nbasis; (iii) design and establish the Infrastructure Project Finance Facility (IPFF), which will \nhouse the Infrastructure Fund, as an independent company operating on a corporate basis; (iv) \ndevelop an approach for building the capacity of line agencies at the federal, provincial, and \nlocal levels in preparing and managing PPI; (v) develop an approach  for providing assistance to \nfinancial institutions in establishing project finance units; and (vii) help develop the domestic \nlong-term  capital  market.  The  TA  will  provide  the  necessary  resources  and  expertise  to \ncomplete the design, establish institutions, and commence pilot activities to ensure that the \nproposed PPI SDP is ready for implementation at loan effectiveness.  \n \n \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The  proposed  PPI  SDP  has  support  from  the  top  levels  of  the  Government.  The \nGovernment will establish a task force chaired by the minister of finance (currently the adviser to \nthe prime minister on finance). Members of the task force will include high-level government \nrepresentatives at the national and regional levels as well as representatives of private sector \nprofessional organizations. The task force will provide advice on the design and implementation \nof the PPI SDP. The task force will be assisted by a secretariat, which is a function of the Core \nProgram Management Unit (CPMU) currently housed at the Prime Minister\u2019s Special Programs \nWing at the Ministry of Finance. The CPMU will manage the PPI SDP, monitor overall progress, \nand  disseminate  information  to  the  public  for  feedback  by  means  of  information  bulletins, \nseminars, and a web site. To ensure adequate implementation capacity, the CPMU will be fully \nstaffed  by  November  2005  based  on  a  development  and  resource  plan.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA will help develop the following tentative outputs \nand key results areas (KRAs), which will be finalized during further preparation of the proposed \nPPI SDP:   \n(i)  Output 1: establish PPI framework  \n(a)  KRA 1.1: develop the PPI strategy and policy; and  \n(b)  KRA  1.2:  develop  PPI  law,  contracts,  and  regulatory  functions  and \ninstitutions. \n(ii)  Output 2: develop PPI transactions \n(a)  KRA 2.1: establish IPDF, \n(b)  KRA 2.2: establish the Infrastructure Fund and IPFF, and \n(c)  KRA 2.3: develop PPI management capability within the Government. \n(iii)  Output 3: develop supporting financing policies and instruments \n(a)  KRA  3.1:  establish  dedicated  project  finance  capability  in  financial \ninstitutions, and \n(b)  KRA 3.2: enhance credit and develop a long-term domestic debt market. \n16.  The PPI SDP will clarify and spell out the Government\u2019s objectives and means for \nimplementing them. The PPI SDP design entails, but is not limited to, the following:  \n(i)  defining the scope of PPI and the role of the task force, working groups, and the \nCPMU; \n(ii)  developing policies and mechanisms, including \n(a)  clarifying institutional responsibility at the federal, provincial, and local \ngovernment  levels  for  selecting,  developing,  implementing,  and \noverseeing PPI design and implementation; \n(b)  clarifying  the  separation  of  powers  of  line  ministries  and  agencies  in \nrelation to their judicial, legal, regulatory, and executive functions; \n(c)  clarifying  and  streamlining  applicable  procurement  and  investment \napproval  processes,  including  managing  the  fiduciary  aspects  of  the \nimpact of PPI on resettlement, the environment, and indigenous peoples; \n(d)  establishing stakeholder feedback and consumer and investor protection \nmechanisms; \n(e)  streamlining  dispute  resolution  between  the  Government,  investors, \ncontractors, and consumers; and \n(f)  establishing appropriate fiscal arrangements; \n(iii)  establishing IPDF for preparing PPI projects in cooperation with relevant federal, \nprovincial, local planning, and line authorities and IPFF; \n ", "  5\n(iv)  establishing  IPFF  for  financial  structuring  and  for  arranging  finance  for  PPI \nprojects; \n(v)  preparing a capacity-building plan in relation to PPI design and management for \nGovernment agencies; \n(vi)  preparing a capacity-building plan for private sector and financial institutions \ninvesting in and financing PPI; and \n(vii)  developing market-based long-term domestic resources for PPI and financial \ninstitutions,  including  a  bond  market  and  supporting  services  such  as  credit \nrating. \n  \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n17.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.3  million  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1  million \nequivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA Funding Program. The Government will finance the \nremaining cost by providing in-kind contributions of office space and suitable CPMU counterpart \nstaff. The cost estimate and financing plan is presented in Appendix 2. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program.   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Finance is the executing and implementing agency for the TA. The \nministry will establish a task force, led by the minister of finance (currently the adviser to the \nprime  minister  on  finance)  to  coordinate  the  TA\u2019s  efforts.  It  has  committed  to  providing \npermanent counterpart staff, suitable offices, and transportation; facilitating the consultants\u2019 \ninteraction with other stakeholders; close collaboration with ADB, and ensuring the participation \nof stakeholders in the policy formulation process.  \n19.  The TA will provide a total of about 40 person-months of consulting services, including \n16 person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  and  24  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants satisfactory to ADB. KRAs 2.1 and 2.2 require an innovative approach. Given the \nlack of a standardized approach for the delivery of such services and given that developing \nsystems, processes, and procedures for PPI transactions and finance are complex and require \nhighly specialized skills and a significant degree of flexibility in the allocation of expertise, the \nquality-based selection method will be applied for KRAs 2.1 and 2.2. Consistent with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures,  the  biodata  technical  proposal  will  be  applied.  For  KRA  2.3,  experts  will  be \nrecruited with experience in PPI practice and training either as individuals or through a firm \nusing the quality-based selection method. For output areas 1 and 3, consultants will be recruited \nas individual senior experts in the fields of PPI policy and law and PPI finance. Appendix 3 \npresents outline terms of reference for consultants. The TA completion date will be 21 months \nfrom the Government\u2019s signing of the TA letter. The TA is expected to commence in November \n2005.   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.

They would pay particular attention as to whether a \ncentral-level regulator can be established to avoid duplication of effort in each province. \n ", "                            Appendix 3        9 \n(viii)  setting out the business objectives, organizational structure, and resources for \nthe Infrastructure Project Development Facility (IPDF) in relation to preparing PPI \nprojects in cooperation with relevant federal, provincial, and local planning and \nline authorities and the Infrastructure Project Financing Facility (IPFF); \n(ix)  determining the structure, resources, and mandate of the Infrastructure Fund to \nbe housed in IPFF; \n(x)  setting out the business objectives, organizational structure, and resources for \nIPFF in relation to the financial structuring of projects and arranging finance for \nprojects;   \n(xi)  establishing  the  process  for  building  capacity  for  nonrecourse  borrowing  by \nsubsovereign entities; \n(xii)  setting out the process for building capacity in the private and financial sectors \nfor participation in investing and financing PPI and incentives for them to do so;  \nand \n(xiii)  assessing  how  to  develop  market-based  long-term  domestic  resources  for \nfinancial  institutions  and  infrastructure  projects,  including development of the \nbond market and supporting services such as credit rating.  \n \n2.  Key Result Area 1.2: Develop Private Participation in Infrastructure Law, \nContracts, and Regulatory Functions and Institutions \n \n4.  In a consultative process with the working groups and the CPMU, the consultants will \nprepare a draft PPI law that will cover a broad range of contractual arrangements for involving \nthe private sector, beginning with service contracts for comprehensive, multiyear concessions. \nThe  working  groups  will  review  the  suitability  of  existing  public  bidding  laws  and  prepare \namendments as necessary to ensure timely and flexible bidding processes.4 Laws will provide \nthe broad parameters, while implementation regulations would permit flexibility to modify and \nadapt arrangements to local and sector contexts. Consultants and working groups will submit \nthe policies to the task force for advice before submitting them for feedback from regions and \nstakeholders in the private and financial sectors and to the Cabinet and Parliament.  \n \nB.  Output 2: Develop Private Participation in Infrastructure Transactions \n \n1.  Key Result Area 2.1: Establish the Infrastructure Project Development \nFacility \n \n5.  To facilitate the timely preparation of PPI transactions, the Government will establish \nIPDF as a not-for-profit company under Article 42 of the Company Law. A representative of the \nMinistry  of  Finance  will  chair  IPDF\u2019s  board,  which  will  consist  largely  of  private  sector \nprofessionals. The company will be run independently, under commercial principles, with an \nincentive to deliver PPI transactions.  \n \n6.  IPDF will have a chief executive officer (CEO) who will be responsible for originating \nprojects in close collaboration with the project sponsors. IPDF will be equipped with sector and \nlegal experts who will create project teams to evaluate projects proposed by local or other public \nauthorities and private sector partners.  \n \n7.  The CEO will be a senior professional experienced in the preparation of infrastructure \nprojects in the private sector and will also have management oversight experience. The IPDF \n                                                 \n4  This process will be closely coordinated with the Pakistan Procurement Regulatory Authority. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nwill  be  staffed  by  professional  staff  on  a  private  sector  pay  scale  and  will  be  audited  by \nindependent auditors.  \n \n8.  Support  is  required  to  develop  a  business  plan,  budget,  and  standard  operating \nprocedures  (currently  being  drafted)  and  the  legal  documentation  incorporating  IPDF.  The \nconsultant will help establish the company. This process includes (i) reviewing its business plan \nand  standard  operating  procedures,  (ii)  establishing accountability and staff reporting lines \nthrough  the  CEO  and  the  board,  (iii)  preparing  the  memorandum  and  articles  for  the \nincorporation of IPDF as a company under Article 42a of the Company Ordinance (2002), (iv)  \nsetting out procedures for appointing board members, (v) selecting and recruiting the CEO, (vi) \nestablishing an office, (vii) recruiting staff, and (viii) establishing logistics. IPDF start-up includes \nthe  selection  and  processing  of  PPI  pilot  projects  prior  to  and  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n \n2.  Key Result Area 2.2: Establish the Infrastructure Fund and the \nInfrastructure Project Finance Facility \n \n9.  Financial institutions participate in infrastructure financing through their corporate and \ninvestment banking arms in the absence of dedicated in-house sector, market, and project \nmanagement expertise. Given the financial institutions\u2019 limited capacity, the absence of a long-\nterm  domestic  debt  market,  and  the  affordability  gaps  of  projects,  alternative  financing \nmechanisms are required to support PPI.  \n \n10.  The Government has decided to establish IPFF as an independent company. IPFF\u2019s \nmandate is to structure and arrange supplemental financing of PPI projects. IPFF will establish \nappropriate business and financial policies for leveraging other bank and nonbank financial \ninstitution financing and will also set minimum standards for the quality of proposals that will be \nentertained to ensure quick decisions. IPFF will likely only receive projects that have been \nvetted and recommended by IPDF. IPFF and IPDF will collaborate during the early stages of a \nproject to ensure that commercial financing criteria are consistent with IPFF credit management \npolicies.  \n \n11.  The Government has recommended considering the integration of the existing long-term \ncredit fund with IPFF. The consultant will (i) set out the structure, business plan, and operating \nand  risk  management  procedures  for  IPFF;  (ii)  review  the  established  lending  and  risk \nmanagement processes of the long-term credit fund; and (iii) recommend whether the long-term \ncredit fund might be integrated with IPFF. To facilitate subordinate and normal long-term debt \nfinancing and targeted subsidies for PPI, the Government announced its decision to establish \nthe Infrastructure Fund in its FY2006 budget. The IF will be housed in the IPFF. \n \n12.  IPFF will set up a business model and risk management processes that are comparable \nwith those of commercially successful infrastructure financial institutions. At a later stage, IPFF \nmay be converted into a financial institution once the uptake of viable PPI projects justifies a \ncommercial operation. Independent underwriting processes for extending credit, grants, and \nguarantees  will  be  established  to  avoid  conflicts  of  interest  between  the  use  of  these \ninstruments and ensure that IPFF will be able to customize assistance to the diverse needs of \nPPI in more and less developed locations. \n \n13.  The consultant will help establish IPFF, including (i) preparing a five-year business plan, \nbudget,  financial  projections,  and  standard  operating  procedures;  (ii)  establishing  the \norganizational   structure  and   policies;   (iii) clarifying  accountability  and  staff  reporting  lines  \n ", "                            Appendix 3        11 \nthrough the CEO and the board; (iv) preparing the memorandum and articles of incorporation for \nIPFF as a limited company under the Company Ordinance; (v) appointing board members; (vi) \nselecting  and  recruiting  the  CEO;  (vii)  setting  up  the  office;  (viii)  recruiting  staff;  and  (ix) \nestablishing logistics. IPFF will supplement the financing provided by the market. It is not \nintended to be a public sector development program funding window. IPFF will also help project \nsponsors gain access to improved market financing terms.  \n \n3.  Key  Result  Area  2.3:  Develop  Management  Capacity  for  Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure within the Government \n \n14.  Capacity development is required to enable public sector counterparts to manage and \nsupervise PPI contracts. IPDF will provide on-the-job assistance. IPDF will share experience \nfrom other regions and locations, which is particularly important during the initial stages when \nfew contracts are under way. Periodic training and outreach will also be necessary to transfer \nexpertise. This training of local government in PPI management skills can be imparted through \nsuitable training institutions. The consultant will prepare a strategy, implementation plan, and \nresource plan for curriculum development that includes the use of existing higher education \ninstitutions under a separate project component. Any such training and capacity building will \ncomplement, and not substitute for, the training and management systems established by each \nindividual project. \n \nC.  Output 3: Develop Supporting Financing Policies and Instruments \n \n15.  Capacity for PPI financing needs to be established within financial institutions. This \nprocess requires convincing financial institution management that PPI is a profitable commercial \nbusiness. It also involves developing mitigation measures for political and regulatory risks, \nespecially for long-term financing. \n  \n1.  Key  Result  Area  3.1:  Financial  Institutions  Establish  Dedicated  Project \nFinance Capability  \n \n16.  PPI  policies  should  encourage  some  financial  institutions  to  recognize  the  market \npotential  of  PPI  and  consider  building  dedicated  expertise  and  business  models.  Larger \nfinancial institutions with a diversified resource and product base may be suitable candidates. \nThe PPI SDP will provide for a technical assistance subproject to support financial institutions \nwith top-level commitment to building dedicated and specialized project finance expertise. This \nwould entail line management responsibility of an experienced project finance specialist to \nestablish an infrastructure unit as a profitable business. Support normally entails the buildup of \nproject  finance  and  management  and  of  sector,  legal,  and  asset  liability  management \ncapabilities. Consulting assistance may be required to finalize the existing technical assistance \nconcept for this key result area.  \n \n2.  Key Result Area 3.2: Credit Enhancement and Development of a Long-\nTerm, Domestic Debt Market  \n \n17.  Developing financial institution capacity will be insufficient to meet PPI funding needs, \nthus  the  domestic  long-term  bond  market  must  be  tapped.  Significant  potential  exists  for \ninvesting long-term funds held by pension funds and public and private insurance companies; \nhowever, bond issuers and rating instruments for these potential investors are not currently \navailable. Under the PPI SDP, a policy and action plan will be put in place to develop the \ndomestic  long-term  bond  market  for  infrastructure.  Bond  issuances  by  subsovereign  bond  \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nissuers will also be generated when the enabling environment has been created. ADB will \nundertake a market assessment of whether assistance to bond market development is feasible. \nBased on the market feedback, consulting assistance may be required.  \n \n3.  Consulting Expertise and Selection Method  \n \n18.  Output  1.  The  consultants  will  be  senior  experts  with  at  least  7  years  of  relevant \npractical experience in the development of (i) PPI strategies and policies in industrial and \ndeveloping countries in a consultative process, (ii) PPI regulatory bodies and arrangements to \nensure investor and consumer feedback, and (iii) PPI laws in a consultative process. This \nincludes  legal,  regulatory,  economic,  project  management,  and  sector  skills.  Output  1  will \nrequire about 8 person-months, with consultants to be selected as individuals. \n \n19.  Output 2.1. The establishment of IPDF mainly requires senior management and legal \nexpertise in establishing and running a service facility, and engineering, legal, and financial \nskills are required to help IPDF structure pilot projects. Output 2.1 will require about 6 person-\nmonths.  Consultants  will  be  selected  under  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  biodata \ntechnical proposals.   \n \n20.  Output 2.2. The IPFF and Infrastructure Fund require extensive managerial and banking \nskills in establishing financial institutions and recruiting a suitable team. Output 2.2 will require \nabout 10 person-months. Consultants will be selected under quality- and cost-based selection \nand biodata technical proposals. \n \n21.  Output 2.3. Expertise in PPI implementation and curriculum structuring is required to set \nup training programs for the public and private sectors. Output 2.3 will require about 6 person-\nmonths. Consultants will be selected either under quality- and cost-based selection and biodata \ntechnical proposals or on an individual basis. \n \n22.  Output  3.  Project  financing,  bond  market  development,  and  banking  expertise  is \nrequired to undertake the necessary best practice benchmarking, to prepare the program for \ndeveloping PPI project finance capacity at dedicated commercial banks, and to analyze the \ndomestic currency bond market. Output 3 will require about 5 2 person-months). Consultants \nwill be selected as individuals. \n \n23.  Project management requires about 8 person-months. Consultants will be selected as \nindividuals.  \n \n  4.  Implementation Schedule  \n \n24.  The design is expected to be completed within 8 weeks of the commencement of the \ntechnical assistance. The subsequent work will focus on establishing the IPDF and IPFF and \nconducting policy reforms under the lead of the policy task force. \n ", "                           Appendix 4        13 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.

No \n   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe development of infrastructure is an integral component of Pakistan\u2019s overall development strategy. This focus is \nevident in the Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u20132010 published in May 2005. The absence of adequate \ninfrastructure has been one of the main bottlenecks to achieving all-around growth and reducing poverty. Promoting \nprivate participation in infrastructure will create fiscal space for the Government to invest in the social sector.     \n \nThe provision of infrastructure will also affect other sectors and will boost construction, manufacturing, services, and \nagriculture. This in turn will generate employment opportunities. The initiative is a high priority to promote sustainable \neconomic growth and meet the growth target of 8% per year in the medium term.  To provide infrastructure services, \ninstitutional mechanisms will have to be put into place that address the concerns of both infrastructure providers and \nusers. Thus a proper enabling environment in terms of a policy and regulatory framework and financing instruments \nwill have to be put in place.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                       Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nHigh-quality and reasonably priced infrastructure will benefit the overall economy in several ways. For example, round \nthe clock availability of power at reasonable prices will improve the productivity of the manufacturing sector and lead to \njob expansion. The reduction in operating costs through low-cost infrastructure will also improve the performance of \nmanufacturing units, services, and agriculture and could potentially lead to additional investments.       \n \nWhile the provision of infrastructure to the economy has an immediate impact on productivity and growth, the creation \nof an enabling environment for providing and operating the infrastructure units is essential. However the impact of \npolicy reform to promote private participation in infrastructure will be indirect and not immediately measurable.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes   No  \n \nUnder this technical assistance (TA), a broadly based task force will be established and will consist of representatives \nfrom the Government, professional bodies, regulatory institutions, and the private sector. This task force will reflect all \nshades of opinion and will meet periodically to develop a policy framework for pertinent issues. The iterative dialogue \nbetween the task force and the working groups will ensure that the policy framework will reflect the concerns of all \nstakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nThe consultative process between the task force and the working groups will be designed to ensure that the process of \npolicy formulation is participatory. Stakeholder participation will be a key element of the design of the processes \nwhereby the task force, the topic-specific working groups, and the consultants take the process forward. The task \nforce, which is envisaged as an apex body, will be consulted during the policy formulation process. This process is a \ncritical part of developing the enabling environment for private participation in infrastructure projects.  \n \n \n ", "14       Appendix 4 \nD.
